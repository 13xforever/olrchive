[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, November 6, 2011, a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto is unveiled, a major MMO goes free to play, and what is in store for the Wii next after Skyward Sword?

00:31.653 --> 00:36.637
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.877 --> 00:38.418

[SPEAKER_11]: We are live tonight, November the 6th of 2011 with the 434th show.

00:47.245 --> 00:55.676
[SPEAKER_11]: We were off last week, but we're back tonight to join you over the next few hours live to talk about video games and gaming culture and have some lols, hopefully.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.279
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you with my co-host.

00:58.660 --> 01:01.784
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hello over there to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:01.944 --> 01:02.344
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

01:02.525 --> 01:02.945
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?

01:04.287 --> 01:05.408
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm tired, Rob

01:24.565 --> 01:51.618
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah yeah yeah I've heard that term before I've actually I've wanted to go I here's my thing with BlizzCon as much as I love the Blizzard products I'm sorry I'm not paying $150 to go to your publicly open press conference and play your demos like I don't get does not compute function but but I will totally go to go to all the hotel parties because there's some sweet parties they get thrown and then like Discon I'll go for that because like shit I go to Disneyland all the time anyway if you listen to the show any length of time you know that

01:51.778 --> 02:00.361
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kept running into other WoW players and so I'd go talk to them and Dan would just roll his eyes and go somewhere else because he pretty much hates it.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.042
[SPEAKER_07]: The WoWs.

02:01.342 --> 02:02.182
[SPEAKER_07]: He hates the WoWs.

02:02.742 --> 02:06.904
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've got a new obsession too, which is the WoW model viewer.

02:07.779 --> 02:07.959
[SPEAKER_11]: Red Bull

02:33.928 --> 02:34.308
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

02:59.232 --> 03:02.017
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to pay me in a big tub of Red Bull.

03:02.037 --> 03:04.341
[SPEAKER_11]: Get that little car to drive around and come give you some.

03:04.641 --> 03:07.987
[SPEAKER_11]: But DarkSakura fed you some of her extra dinner or whatever.

03:08.308 --> 03:09.871
[SPEAKER_11]: Were you just cooking for the fun of it?

03:10.757 --> 03:24.828
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted beef stew because it's gotten cold outside, and I had broth, you know, stuff to make broth out of, so I just made, I made a vegetable broth in the crock pot overnight, and then I made the beef stew in the morning.

03:24.908 --> 03:27.149
[SPEAKER_11]: And crock pot cooking is in right now.

03:27.230 --> 03:29.451
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I notice a lot of people are, like, really into it.

03:29.471 --> 03:30.312
[SPEAKER_07]: It never went out.

03:30.792 --> 03:31.193
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easy.

03:31.233 --> 03:31.773
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why.

03:31.833 --> 03:33.354
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it just seems like I'm noticing it more.

03:33.434 --> 03:35.436
[SPEAKER_09]: The Paula Deen recipe for pot roast is...

03:35.896 --> 03:37.177
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

03:55.336 --> 03:55.836
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

04:13.121 --> 04:13.922
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Dance Revolution

04:30.095 --> 04:45.983
[SPEAKER_11]: and we used to go to these marathon sessions of playing that at the arcade and we would go to dinner afterwards with other friends and we just sat around and talked shit about video games whether it be DDR or whatever else is at the arcade for hours and hours afterwards and I had been dabbling in internet radio so at DarkSakura before that

04:46.824 --> 05:01.105
[SPEAKER_11]: and so we decided to kind of take that into an internet radio show and Loki joined us along the way and that's where Orange Launch Radio was born we pride ourselves on the fact that we interact we do the show live, we always have very rare are we not live usually it has to be a computer issue or something

05:02.086 --> 05:21.965
[SPEAKER_11]: Out of the 434 episodes we'd have, I'd say about 430 of those are probably live And interacting with you guys in our chatroom We have you guys in chat, giving live commentary on the show Also you guys can call us later in the show We like to embrace new social media as it comes out So Facebook, we're on there, Twitter, we're on there

05:22.205 --> 05:23.045
[SPEAKER_06]: We give it a big kiss.

05:45.936 --> 05:48.398
[SPEAKER_09]: I will never say no to that, I don't care what it is

06:16.994 --> 06:37.618
[SPEAKER_11]: and Skyrim is out on Friday and I'm just thinking like oh god that's gonna be another sucking my time away and I'm hearing it's great which I was expecting so yay I don't have enough time to play everything what games are you guys looking forward to this holiday season if anything DarkSakura is there anything maybe it's already out I'm looking forward to sleeping

06:38.579 --> 06:41.921
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to the semester being over, so to actually play the shit I have.

06:42.822 --> 06:52.850
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, because I started playing Symphony of the Night again, and I've just been too tired to really play anything other than WoW and the other couple things I'm playing.

06:53.710 --> 06:58.772
[SPEAKER_07]: It's honestly, if it comes out and it falls into my lap, I'll be happy to play it.

06:59.712 --> 07:06.235
[SPEAKER_07]: If it comes out and it's something that I want, I'll find a way to make it happen.

07:06.275 --> 07:10.976
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now, I'm just not really doing the looking forward to anything kind of deal.

07:11.517 --> 07:13.877
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing the get me through the next three weeks.

07:14.077 --> 07:15.238
[SPEAKER_07]: We go to print next week.

07:16.358 --> 07:16.778
[SPEAKER_07]: This week.

07:17.739 --> 07:19.219
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck me, we go to print this week.

07:19.539 --> 07:20.060
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

07:20.200 --> 07:20.820
[SPEAKER_11]: IRL stuff.

07:22.381 --> 07:24.924
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, what are you looking forward to this holiday?

07:24.964 --> 07:25.725
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I had to ask.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.226
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's Tuesday, right?

07:28.227 --> 07:29.008
[SPEAKER_09]: Next Tuesday.

07:29.508 --> 07:30.329
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, next Tuesday.

07:30.609 --> 07:32.051
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any special events?

07:32.311 --> 07:33.733
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you take Wednesday off work?

07:34.133 --> 07:35.935
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have anything planned special?

07:36.365 --> 07:41.593
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkTetsuya says, Loki, would you play anything even if it's Skylanders 2?

07:53.854 --> 07:56.215
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to send me a free copy of that.

07:56.296 --> 07:58.637
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do something creative with those toys.

07:58.937 --> 08:06.002
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at Twitter and getting the feel for what people are saying, I'm seeing a lot of positive stuff about it, especially from the people that have kids.

08:06.962 --> 08:09.404
[SPEAKER_11]: Really seem to enjoy Skylanders as a fun game to play with kids.

08:09.424 --> 08:12.686
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad that they were able to lower their standards for their kids.

08:13.186 --> 08:17.329
[SPEAKER_09]: because, you know, kids, they're definitely not attached to stupid toys nowadays.

08:18.370 --> 08:28.498
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, and trust me, Activision is getting behind publishing games that are on the DS for a lot of those stupid toys that you're just like, I don't understand why these kids like that.

08:28.718 --> 08:29.179
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

08:29.199 --> 08:29.799
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

08:29.819 --> 08:30.980
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand.

08:32.281 --> 08:37.865
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not trying to sound like, you know, the bitter old man or whatever that's like, oh, I don't understand these kids.

08:38.266 --> 08:42.209
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand these kids' games and their toys and blah, blah, blah.

08:42.597 --> 08:45.860
[SPEAKER_09]: No, seriously, their toys are stupid compared to the stuff that we used to have.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.263
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, our toys used to do stuff.

08:48.403 --> 08:53.408
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it may have been stupid things like, you know, karate chopping arm and stuff, but you know what?

08:53.448 --> 08:55.050
[SPEAKER_11]: Teddy Ruxpin was the fucking future.

08:55.090 --> 08:55.910
[SPEAKER_11]: He could read anything.

08:56.511 --> 08:57.332
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a Teddy Ruxpin.

08:58.013 --> 08:58.593
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you do.

08:59.854 --> 09:00.295
[SPEAKER_09]: And grubby.

09:02.992 --> 09:04.553
[SPEAKER_09]: and most of the... My buddy.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.015
[SPEAKER_09]: Wherever you go, he goes.

09:07.636 --> 09:09.337
[SPEAKER_09]: I had one of those things.

09:10.037 --> 09:15.901
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, his face is definitely hard and you can do some serious injuries to other people with that stuff.

09:16.301 --> 09:19.744
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but... I'm just saying, like, okay.

09:20.404 --> 09:21.225
[SPEAKER_09]: Skylanders...

09:22.867 --> 09:24.289
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:41.212 --> 09:42.033
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, you know what?

09:42.273 --> 09:46.516
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy your kids a good game and buy them some other toys that are also very good.

09:47.576 --> 09:58.424
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to say, for those that didn't have the privilege of growing up when these old people here on this program grew up, just let me take you back a few years here as to what we were into at the time.

09:58.664 --> 09:59.084
[SPEAKER_11]: Here you go.

10:02.386 --> 10:05.569
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I wasn't necessarily into My Buddy, but my parents bought it for me.

10:21.195 --> 10:23.421
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a giant fucking doll.

10:24.203 --> 10:26.769
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like... Kidsisters at a tea party, though.

10:28.041 --> 10:36.027
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it was just seriously... I mean, it could have been just a Cabbage Patch doll, but... That's probably what it was trying to capitalize on.

10:36.047 --> 10:37.648
[SPEAKER_05]: I had Cabbage Patch Kids.

10:37.728 --> 10:39.249
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry for the poor audio on that.

10:40.430 --> 10:42.191
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not saying that that toy was good.

10:42.411 --> 10:43.532
[SPEAKER_09]: That toy was not good at all.

10:43.732 --> 10:44.893
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I recognize that it was.

10:45.213 --> 10:52.959
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, Teddy Ruxpin was kind of an interesting toy because it was a thing that played tapes...

10:53.419 --> 10:54.339
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, cassette tapes.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.081
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some kids that are maybe even listening to the show don't know what that is.

10:58.582 --> 10:59.602
[SPEAKER_09]: But cassette tapes.

11:00.062 --> 11:07.406
[SPEAKER_09]: And they would actually move their mouth to the actual audio.

11:07.426 --> 11:09.147
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think they had it split or something like that.

11:09.207 --> 11:10.147
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's how it worked.

11:11.348 --> 11:13.129
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would read stories to you.

11:13.309 --> 11:14.029
[SPEAKER_09]: And interact.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.590
[SPEAKER_09]: They had the little play sets and stuff like that.

11:16.690 --> 11:17.551
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are kind of cool.

11:17.591 --> 11:19.852
[SPEAKER_09]: Because at the time it was pretty cutting edge stuff.

11:20.772 --> 11:20.992
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

11:22.333 --> 11:24.177
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I love this comment in our chat room.

11:24.497 --> 11:30.568
[SPEAKER_11]: Alpha Cananogram says, I had a My Buddy, but then I saw a movie or clips of a Chucky movie and stopped playing with it.

11:30.769 --> 11:31.771
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, you know what?

11:32.671 --> 11:33.812
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't say I blame you there.

11:33.972 --> 11:40.876
[SPEAKER_07]: Yesterday, and okay, I'm on the American River Review staff and we sometimes go in on Saturdays and Sundays to do extra work.

11:41.416 --> 11:42.197
[SPEAKER_07]: So we play movies.

11:43.457 --> 11:59.827
[SPEAKER_07]: And yesterday we were watching an MST3K movie that was called The Devil Doll about this mannequin and we just kept singing the My Buddy theme over and over every time the mannequin would show up on the screen.

12:00.307 --> 12:01.088
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:17.746 --> 12:18.266
[SPEAKER_11]: and one of the

12:42.759 --> 12:43.380
[SPEAKER_11]: Herp-a-derp!

12:43.460 --> 12:45.502
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course it was all Halloween-themed, stupid!

12:45.863 --> 12:50.869
[SPEAKER_11]: They had one that was all Hollywood-themed, and they had all the recreations of the different movies.

12:51.289 --> 12:56.996
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the rooms had a Chucky doll, and it was really scary and good life, and then it started moving.

12:57.216 --> 12:58.398
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a freaking midget!

12:58.738 --> 12:59.819
[SPEAKER_11]: as the Chucky doll.

13:00.039 --> 13:00.560
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.081
[SPEAKER_11]: It started following you around.

13:02.121 --> 13:03.061
[SPEAKER_11]: It was freaky.

13:03.622 --> 13:04.983
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they were really good at scaring people.

13:05.463 --> 13:08.406
[SPEAKER_11]: This was the only way some people would do it.

13:08.426 --> 13:10.607
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a rule, like a strip club.

13:11.068 --> 13:13.129
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't touch you, you don't touch us.

13:13.349 --> 13:14.570
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a no touching rule.

13:14.871 --> 13:17.933
[SPEAKER_11]: But they will get right up in your face and all this stuff.

13:17.953 --> 13:20.695
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a Freddy Krueger that had sparks coming out.

13:21.215 --> 13:21.776
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

13:21.816 --> 13:22.917
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really well done.

13:22.957 --> 13:25.499
[SPEAKER_11]: But the Chucky doll, just the whole talk about that made me think of this.

13:25.959 --> 13:26.600
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:46.198 --> 13:47.080
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

14:02.982 --> 14:04.544
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't test me on my Silent Hill.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.125
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not, I'm not.

14:06.966 --> 14:10.008
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the other things that truly scared me was the dentist in there.

14:10.028 --> 14:12.010
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, the dentist is scary.

14:12.530 --> 14:19.096
[SPEAKER_11]: And had an air gun that you didn't know he had until just the right person, which happened to be me, walked by.

14:19.376 --> 14:21.457
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have the drilling noises and all of a sudden, psst.

14:22.078 --> 14:22.879
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, ah!

14:23.119 --> 14:23.279
No!

14:24.895 --> 14:25.796
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

14:43.368 --> 14:48.574
[SPEAKER_09]: Or buy them like, I mean, fuck, $200 you can buy a really nice, you know, toy or something.

14:48.654 --> 14:50.936
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a lot of toys for $200.

14:51.997 --> 14:55.241
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can guarantee they'll probably have a lot more fun than they did with Skylanders.

14:55.421 --> 14:58.324
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a neat concept, but, I mean, come on.

15:00.205 --> 15:02.387
[SPEAKER_09]: You can buy a cheap arcade cabinet for that.

15:23.060 --> 15:25.321
[SPEAKER_11]: Did they have this?

15:26.162 --> 15:27.302
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do they have this now?

15:28.343 --> 15:29.283
[SPEAKER_11]: That they had when I was a kid?

15:29.543 --> 15:33.745
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is what I would spend $200 on.

15:36.487 --> 15:38.207
[SPEAKER_11]: Domino Rally was the shit.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.730
[SPEAKER_11]: Like your dominoes would do like loop-de-loops.

15:45.231 --> 15:47.452
[SPEAKER_11]: Check out that awesome 80s power music to this commercial.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.353
[SPEAKER_11]: And like dominoes would go down slides.

15:51.403 --> 15:54.933
[SPEAKER_11]: and this took all day to set up for like 10 seconds of fun.

15:56.377 --> 15:58.858
[SPEAKER_11]: Domino Rally, get all three sets.

15:59.478 --> 16:00.098
[SPEAKER_09]: There's more than three.

16:00.338 --> 16:01.838
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have spent $200 on Domino Rally.

16:03.939 --> 16:04.439
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anyway.

16:06.080 --> 16:10.081
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we should talk about our gaming weeks, but DarkSakura left, so I guess we'll do things out of order.

16:10.561 --> 16:17.063
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll move into our gaming weeks, the types of video games that you have been playing this week, and Loki will start tonight with you, since DarkSakura left the room real quick.

16:17.163 --> 16:19.683
[SPEAKER_11]: Her husband just got home, so I think she had to go tend to him.

16:19.763 --> 16:21.584
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly Grand Theft Auto 4, usual.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.844
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, still playing Lost and Damned.

16:23.884 --> 16:25.405
[SPEAKER_09]: We moved to airport games now.

16:26.045 --> 16:36.330
[SPEAKER_09]: and my co-worker was getting slightly better at killing people in the airport and of course I refined my technique and now I'm up there with him again.

16:36.950 --> 16:41.232
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're having some pretty high scoring games like $3,000 games which is pretty awesome.

16:42.532 --> 16:56.777
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, I actually played a little bit of Saints Row II on PC with a wonderful add-on patch from a group called Idle Ninja.

16:57.577 --> 17:03.059
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have a patch mod, if you will, called Gentlemen of the Row.

17:04.369 --> 17:04.969
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

17:24.495 --> 17:25.015
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

17:39.247 --> 17:39.928
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

18:00.442 --> 18:05.328
[SPEAKER_09]: And then let's see, other than that, I played Plants vs. Zombies on the iPod again.

18:05.348 --> 18:06.469
[SPEAKER_09]: I went back to that a little bit.

18:06.890 --> 18:07.831
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on the roof now.

18:08.532 --> 18:10.254
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a huge sale at Halloween time too.

18:10.394 --> 18:11.475
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you could get it for like 99 cents.

18:12.270 --> 18:13.892
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I like the game.

18:13.952 --> 18:19.978
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, it's a little annoying that it just keeps ramping, like, it keeps changing the game, like, every single level.

18:20.298 --> 18:23.882
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't mind it, like... Well, do you want the same stage as every level?

18:23.942 --> 18:24.823
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be boring.

18:24.843 --> 18:26.525
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it just should get more difficult, you know?

18:26.605 --> 18:28.387
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, like, I don't know.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.889
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they put new game mechanics in every stage.

18:30.989 --> 18:31.790
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, exactly.

18:33.712 --> 18:50.019
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's fine you know it's pretty cool so I've been playing a little bit of that and then um what else uh that's pretty much it actually just not a whole lot but I mean I can't wait I'm just like

18:52.350 --> 18:54.292
[SPEAKER_09]: I need the Saints for the third.

18:54.312 --> 18:54.972
[SPEAKER_11]: I need it.

18:55.232 --> 18:58.375
[SPEAKER_11]: Hoping your distributor connections will come through and you can get the game early this week.

18:59.796 --> 19:00.376
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.618
[SPEAKER_09]: After the week I've had, I'm ready.

19:02.978 --> 19:05.961
[SPEAKER_11]: Next Sunday's going to be a big Gaming Week show because hopefully Loki will have that.

19:06.001 --> 19:06.942
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have Skyrim.

19:06.962 --> 19:10.224
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura will have... I don't know what she'll have, but it'll be good.

19:10.745 --> 19:13.307
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have a weekend that I can sleep through.

19:14.268 --> 19:14.508
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

19:14.728 --> 19:18.371
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, sorry we started without you, but we'll go back and do your Gaming Week.

19:18.391 --> 19:18.811
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

19:18.931 --> 19:19.652
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to potty.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.541
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I thought you ran out and said hi to Dan because I heard he got home.

19:22.861 --> 19:23.481
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, what's up?

19:23.601 --> 19:24.221
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your gaming week?

19:24.541 --> 19:25.281
[SPEAKER_07]: I played well.

19:26.101 --> 19:30.182
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played DC Universe online, which is kind of ass.

19:30.643 --> 19:31.123
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't like it?

19:31.963 --> 19:34.823
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm not saying that I hated it, but the control is really crabby.

19:35.444 --> 19:39.044
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hate that you have to keep turning the camera as you're running and doing everything.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.365
[SPEAKER_07]: And with my trackball mouse, it's just not reasonable.

19:42.445 --> 19:47.887
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I could do it really easy in Portal 2, but I can't really do it for DC Universe.

19:47.907 --> 19:48.307
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why?

19:48.547 --> 19:48.727
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

19:48.787 --> 19:49.347
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it sucks?

19:49.867 --> 19:50.987
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, not because it sucks.

19:51.467 --> 19:52.408
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe it sucks.

19:52.428 --> 19:53.368
[SPEAKER_09]: Because trackballs suck.

19:53.408 --> 19:54.128
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how you do it.

19:54.188 --> 19:55.128
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate trackballs.

19:55.708 --> 20:06.591
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly because I think the game is meant more to be played with a controller than... Because using a right analog stick to control your camera is kind of natural for a lot of people.

20:06.631 --> 20:12.232
[SPEAKER_11]: You might want to give it another go with an Xbox 360 controller plugged into your computer if you have any wired ones, because the game will pick it right up.

20:12.512 --> 20:19.194
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the game was designed to be console slash... Kind of like Final Fantasy XI was, and you felt more comfortable with that on the controller.

20:19.214 --> 20:19.334
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

20:19.594 --> 20:20.875
[SPEAKER_11]: That might be the trick.

20:21.095 --> 20:21.616
[SPEAKER_11]: Or it might not.

20:21.676 --> 20:21.976
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

20:21.996 --> 20:23.037
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, DC Universe is a very different kind of game.

20:23.057 --> 20:25.459
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've also been playing more with keyboard and mouse so much lately.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.362
[SPEAKER_07]: And keep in mind, using a regular controller actually hurts my hands after a while.

20:30.162 --> 20:34.806
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can't play a game for a long period of time like I can if I use keyboard and mouse.

20:35.767 --> 20:40.991
[SPEAKER_09]: You should try one of those things that look like a kickboard that they were pimping on All Games Network a while back.

20:41.391 --> 20:42.773
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, that thing was painful.

20:43.624 --> 20:45.847
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, I gave them to you.

20:46.047 --> 20:51.293
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually no you didn't, but I saw one at the store and it's too painful.

20:51.814 --> 20:52.214
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too bad.

20:52.395 --> 20:52.875
[SPEAKER_09]: It was painful.

20:53.055 --> 20:54.397
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I remember seeing one.

20:54.417 --> 21:02.386
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember what they're even called now, but they look like they had all these weird, almost like a spider-like thing over the controller that you hear.

21:02.987 --> 21:08.972
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to improve your reaction time by hitting the different buttons, by kind of moving your fingers in different ways and stuff like that.

21:09.373 --> 21:10.013
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're terrible.

21:10.193 --> 21:12.095
[SPEAKER_09]: My coworker took one home.

21:12.155 --> 21:16.399
[SPEAKER_11]: Brad from PodCulture is in our chat room right now and says, Pat, controls are just fine.

21:16.479 --> 21:17.580
[SPEAKER_11]: Use a 360 controller.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.602
[SPEAKER_11]: So another vote to try a controller, I guess.

21:21.123 --> 21:22.664
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how I was playing in the beta.

21:22.844 --> 21:23.405
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know.

21:23.885 --> 21:24.426
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying.

21:25.066 --> 21:29.230
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, honestly, I'm playing a PC game because I want to play a PC game.

21:30.611 --> 21:32.553
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's fine.

21:32.773 --> 21:36.236
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also, I ran into way too many derps by the time I got through the Brainiac thing.

21:37.069 --> 21:39.091
[SPEAKER_11]: Star Wars MMO Star Wars MMO

22:00.970 --> 22:02.311
[SPEAKER_11]: Star Trek Online Stayed pretty consistent

22:18.618 --> 22:20.199
[SPEAKER_11]: DC Universe is also just a really different MMO.

22:20.259 --> 22:20.799
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not WoW.

22:20.819 --> 22:21.459
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not WoW.

22:21.479 --> 22:25.622
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more like, imagine if Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game, was an MMO.

22:25.642 --> 22:29.824
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like playing City of Heroes, but even worse control.

22:47.210 --> 22:48.311
[SPEAKER_07]: City of Heroes is fine.

22:48.431 --> 22:52.493
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I could play Star Trek online because it played like City of Heroes, which is no problem.

22:53.053 --> 22:55.894
[SPEAKER_07]: But, of course, me and my Marvel love, I made a chick Hawkeye.

22:56.975 --> 22:57.295
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

22:57.315 --> 23:00.817
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, her name is Hawk in Hebrew.

23:00.937 --> 23:05.399
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that was just your problem is you just couldn't do the DC Universe thing.

23:05.659 --> 23:08.721
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been enjoying watching Dan play through Arkham City.

23:08.841 --> 23:10.402
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but Batman's Batman, you know?

23:12.063 --> 23:15.244
[SPEAKER_07]: That and I just think the whole Batman Catwoman thing is hot.

23:15.264 --> 23:17.345
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually sat down and read two DC comics.

23:17.805 --> 23:18.145
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

23:18.286 --> 23:23.368
[SPEAKER_07]: I read the first two issues of the new Catwoman thing because it had Batman Loki in it.

23:24.048 --> 23:24.268
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

23:26.409 --> 23:27.469
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty hot too.

23:27.729 --> 23:29.550
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

23:30.109 --> 23:44.937
[SPEAKER_07]: um oh yeah R-Type on the iPhone really hard to control I was gonna say I mean no it's actually not hard to control but like once it's like it's how I am with R-Type anyway once you lose those power-ups it's sort of like what's the point I'm gonna die in five seconds

23:46.033 --> 23:48.275
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:14.284 --> 24:19.187
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was awesome, because it was X-Men, and it's prepared to die.

24:19.667 --> 24:19.968
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

24:20.228 --> 24:28.072
[SPEAKER_09]: I also tried a little bit of Crafted, which is the Minecraft knockoff on the iPod, iPhone, or whatever that's 2D.

24:28.673 --> 24:32.195
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I care about that as much as I care about Minecraft.

24:32.315 --> 24:34.456
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just like, nope, don't care.

24:34.937 --> 24:35.677
[SPEAKER_09]: Try playing it.

24:35.717 --> 24:36.718
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like Terraria.

24:36.938 --> 24:37.858
[SPEAKER_07]: I also have something else.

24:38.018 --> 24:38.799
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I talk about it now?

24:39.059 --> 24:39.239
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

24:39.359 --> 24:42.001
[SPEAKER_07]: The other fun thing I've been playing with that isn't a game but related to a game.

24:42.021 --> 24:42.181
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

24:42.581 --> 24:43.882
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing with the WoW Model Viewer.

24:44.966 --> 24:45.406
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is that?

24:45.526 --> 24:46.707
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because you're obsessed with WoW?

24:46.807 --> 24:51.228
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, because there's a webcomic going to be coming out called Hillsbred Blues.

24:51.768 --> 24:52.788
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep your eyes open, everybody.

24:53.529 --> 25:04.412
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've been playing, actually I spent last night while my internet was down looking through all the different models and finding the unused ones and all the derp ones and finding what the spawners look like.

25:04.812 --> 25:07.973
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you see a bunny, be careful, it could spawn something.

25:08.333 --> 25:10.614
[SPEAKER_07]: They use bunnies a lot for spawning things.

25:11.306 --> 25:26.003
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright But yeah, it's just kind of fun I found Alfred Copperworth And I found Alexandra McQueen So I'm just laughing at the NPC names Good times I think it's fun Yeah I like to see what makes my games tick

25:27.735 --> 25:28.356
[SPEAKER_11]: My gaming week.

25:29.376 --> 25:33.057
[SPEAKER_11]: I've played Warcraft as well, but I've played a heck of a lot of console stuff too.

25:33.077 --> 25:35.318
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to talk about a few games I've been playing this week.

25:35.778 --> 25:40.239
[SPEAKER_11]: The first I'll talk about is a game called Disney Universe, which came out a couple weeks ago.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.980
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on, I think, 360 and PS3.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.421
[SPEAKER_11]: It might be on PC as well.

25:45.501 --> 25:58.068
[SPEAKER_11]: at first glance it looks like a little big planet Disney game and I would say that's true to an extent but the game itself plays more like a Lego game like if you played those at all I saw the trailer actually for the game when I was seeing Ghostbusters

25:58.433 --> 26:24.393
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've played the game a little bit and it's cute, it's a basic platformer, definitely something that younger kids and tweens would get into Those folks that are expecting it to be like Kingdom Hearts, nah, no, it's a lot more simple But if you're into Disney like I am and you like to collect things because the game has a lot of collectibles Especially like powering up different suits, yes there is a Tron suit, that's why I had to go with that It was also in the trailer

26:24.733 --> 26:27.935
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and there's stuff from Pixar is involved too.

26:28.275 --> 26:30.436
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's definitely a lot of stuff to just kind of absorb.

26:30.596 --> 26:32.237
[SPEAKER_11]: But the game itself is very basic.

26:32.397 --> 26:35.118
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely not the depth of LittleBigPlanet.

26:36.319 --> 26:40.941
[SPEAKER_11]: And therefore, the $60 price tag, excuse me, I think it's actually a $50 price tag.

26:40.981 --> 26:41.081
[SPEAKER_11]: It's $49.99.

26:42.021 --> 26:46.764
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually got three games from the Amazon buy two, get one free sale, which are the games I'm talking about tonight.

26:47.304 --> 26:50.946
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I don't really know exactly how much they all were because I paid like $100 for three.

26:50.966 --> 26:51.606
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's $50 retail.

26:51.666 --> 26:52.186
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it $50 retail?

26:52.206 --> 26:52.386
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

26:53.627 --> 27:13.436
[SPEAKER_11]: that's still asking a bit much this is something that I think is going to be a great deal when it's on sale for 20 or 30 but if you're like really hardcore into Disney or you really just want like a basic platformer for fun something with collectibles I think you'd be into it but if you're looking for something a little more like a game with a lot more depth I'm not so sure you're going to find it here

27:14.296 --> 27:21.299
[SPEAKER_11]: You definitely see the inspirations from LittleBigPlanet, some of the minigames and so forth, which are cute but very basic.

27:21.739 --> 27:24.640
[SPEAKER_11]: The game is not anything you haven't played before.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.261
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just with Disney-looking Sackboy characters.

27:27.682 --> 27:27.922
[SPEAKER_11]: Cute.

27:29.502 --> 27:32.163
[SPEAKER_11]: A game that I played a bit more of was Dance Central 2.

27:32.204 --> 27:35.105
[SPEAKER_11]: It came out this past couple weeks, and...

27:36.145 --> 27:38.669
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's definitely an improvement over the original.

27:39.470 --> 27:42.834
[SPEAKER_11]: Some things I noticed right away, fitness mode is like 10 times better.

27:43.214 --> 27:47.780
[SPEAKER_11]: They have some prearranged fitness playlists that you can play, which I was having a lot of fun with.

27:48.020 --> 27:52.946
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a story mode kind of built into it, which encourages you to mix up the songs a little more too.

27:54.027 --> 27:54.908
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:11.937 --> 28:25.554
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing that disappointed me a little bit is that when you did that, and surely they had to know that there was a lot of people that were going to do that, it doesn't really integrate the Dance Central 1 stuff into the non-arcade modes.

28:26.054 --> 28:27.436
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the fitness mode and the...

28:28.357 --> 28:28.977
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

28:48.943 --> 29:16.856
[SPEAKER_11]: with Dance Central 2 is I don't think the song list is as strong as the first game there's some good songs in there but there's also some kind of really derpy songs as well like there's a Justin Bieber song in there there's a Britney cover in there and it's like harmonics is better than covers like I understand that Britney's very danceable and you want a Britney song in your game but you shouldn't have to resort to covers you can get another song there's danceable songs out there that are not Britney Spears and you know what people probably don't care yeah

29:17.356 --> 29:25.504
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, but there was some songs that made me laugh, like there's Hadaway's What Is Love, and so it made me really laugh that that was in the game, and yes, you do the head bob as part of it.

29:26.085 --> 29:26.545
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

29:26.766 --> 29:33.272
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, that's the kind of thing you lull at parties, but, you know, once you've played it once, you don't really want to play that song over and over again.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.875
[SPEAKER_11]: But it did have some, it had some good songs.

29:36.635 --> 29:38.037
[SPEAKER_11]: The dances, um...

29:39.542 --> 29:41.463
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, guys out there?

29:42.283 --> 29:55.347
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to have to kind of let your inhibitions go for some of these dances because all I have to say... If you play Born This Way by Lady Gaga, expect to do moves like princess snaps and...

29:57.368 --> 30:22.243
[SPEAKER_11]: something about Queen like where you make the little crown like she does in the video if you've ever seen the Born This Way video they kind of put that dance move in there so like I can just imagine a bunch of bros playing Dance Central 2 I mean not that that's really like the broski kind of game to be playing anyway but let's just say that you know it found its way out at a frat party like if you want to impress the ladies expect to really let your inhibitions go in some of these dances

30:22.523 --> 30:22.783
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah.

30:48.760 --> 30:49.761
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

31:07.163 --> 31:11.927
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually when I leave OLR, I want to go home and play WoW, but today I want to go home and play Arkham City because I'm really into it.

31:12.667 --> 31:21.394
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll say this, the story just... I loved that you had five villains in the first 15 minutes, but it didn't feel like overload.

31:21.454 --> 31:23.856
[SPEAKER_11]: It felt like it made sense with the story, it was good.

31:25.777 --> 31:30.061
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I love that it's open world now and that there's all these side quest things you can do.

31:31.442 --> 31:33.844
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more fluid than the last one to me even.

31:33.944 --> 31:35.566
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't even put my finger on it.

31:35.646 --> 31:37.487
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like GTA Batman.

31:38.208 --> 31:39.729
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and that's really rad.

31:39.809 --> 31:41.991
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you something too.

31:42.151 --> 31:45.394
[SPEAKER_07]: As you finish certain parts of the game, you actually...

31:47.397 --> 31:48.378
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

32:05.339 --> 32:07.001
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them are just cake.

32:07.081 --> 32:07.661
[SPEAKER_07]: They're right there.

32:08.462 --> 32:09.983
[SPEAKER_07]: But some of them are really hard.

32:10.424 --> 32:12.546
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Catwoman switching out is actually pretty neat.

32:13.607 --> 32:16.029
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll get points that you can switch out with Catwoman.

32:16.570 --> 32:17.010
[SPEAKER_11]: Very cool.

32:17.230 --> 32:19.612
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I put in the code to get that.

32:20.453 --> 32:21.074
[SPEAKER_07]: She cracks that whip.

32:47.051 --> 32:47.311
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

32:47.511 --> 32:49.953
[SPEAKER_09]: Where she slides under a door like that or something like that?

32:50.013 --> 32:51.754
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the new movie's not out yet.

32:51.794 --> 32:52.174
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not the new.

32:52.194 --> 32:53.295
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we talking about Batman Returns?

32:53.495 --> 32:54.536
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about Batman Returns.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.217
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think she's ever mentioned that.

32:56.917 --> 32:59.499
[SPEAKER_07]: And on top of that, she didn't have the cleavage in Batman Returns.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.360
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is, I mean, Batman Returns was what, 1993?

33:01.440 --> 33:07.063
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the full body black suit and this is the zip up jumpsuit Catwoman.

33:07.143 --> 33:13.307
[SPEAKER_11]: And like, when that movie came out, Bane wasn't even in the Batman universe yet, I don't think.

33:13.447 --> 33:15.568
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, a lot's changed since then.

33:15.728 --> 33:16.229
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um...

33:16.869 --> 33:20.553
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm having a really good time with it, so I can't wait to go home and play more of it.

33:21.514 --> 33:22.175
[SPEAKER_11]: We're having a good time.

33:25.599 --> 33:26.500
[SPEAKER_11]: Slick interface, too.

33:27.341 --> 33:29.423
[SPEAKER_11]: Even right away from the menus, I was like, this is really cool.

33:29.463 --> 33:30.084
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to play the 3D.

33:31.906 --> 33:38.613
[SPEAKER_11]: It has like 3D where you can just use red and blue glasses or some type of, I think some other type of glasses I'm sure they're selling.

33:39.074 --> 33:41.496
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, you can get 3D with a 2D TV, which is kind of cool.

33:41.717 --> 33:47.383
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say that the whole thing is actually a very well done package.

33:48.644 --> 33:53.870
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Leo Shannon in our chatroom says, yeah, but when you play Catwoman, they all refer to her as bitch.

33:54.813 --> 33:55.333
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.

33:55.353 --> 33:57.475
[SPEAKER_07]: They call Batman the Bat.

33:58.315 --> 34:00.876
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, bitch is a little bit more derogatory.

34:01.057 --> 34:11.302
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, well, whereas maybe they could use a little more variety in their derogative terms, I do get the sense that they're taunting Batman as well.

34:12.003 --> 34:15.285
[SPEAKER_11]: But I haven't played as Catwoman much more than the opening sequence yet.

34:15.665 --> 34:19.507
[SPEAKER_11]: But if they do just keep saying bitch, bitch, bitch, that does seem a little bit lazy to me.

34:20.864 --> 34:23.565
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much, or they'll say it's the cat or Catwoman.

34:23.706 --> 34:31.209
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they call her by name, but they also say... I mean, the first thing, if you've got a woman who's being annoying to you, what's the first thing you're going to call her?

34:31.349 --> 34:31.589
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitch.

34:31.609 --> 34:31.909
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitch.

34:32.330 --> 34:32.790
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

34:33.030 --> 34:36.051
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's a man being annoying to me, the first thing I think to call him is bitch, too.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.232
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

34:37.472 --> 34:39.173
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'm just an equal opportunity bitcher.

34:40.053 --> 34:40.894
[SPEAKER_05]: Call him dick.

34:41.175 --> 34:42.937
[SPEAKER_11]: But keep in mind this too.

34:43.217 --> 34:45.740
[SPEAKER_11]: They might be calling you a bitch, but you're about ready to kick their ass.

34:46.481 --> 34:53.170
[SPEAKER_11]: The one tiny negative I will say about Batman, granted I'm playing it on easy because I really just want the story.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.252
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a little bit button mashy.

34:56.013 --> 35:21.279
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's button mashing with finesse if that makes sense like it just it's very fluid and it's cool like it's not to the point where I find it annoying it's button mashy in the way that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the arcade game was button mashy and it was still fun so I have to say that I really like the artwork that's come out with the game I'm sure on the harder modes there's more to it than just button mashing but I am playing it on easy so

35:21.721 --> 35:23.702
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35:40.815 --> 35:47.565
[SPEAKER_11]: For the sake of having a clean podcast, we are going to try and just tear straight through without really stopping because of downtimes.

35:48.226 --> 35:51.691
[SPEAKER_11]: So we apologize to the live listeners, but it is an issue that's out of our control.

35:52.032 --> 35:54.916
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, DarkSakura, you said your net's gone down, like, what, three times over the weekend?

35:54.956 --> 35:56.899
[SPEAKER_11]: It affected your rating in WOW last night?

35:57.699 --> 36:12.104
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gone down off and on over the last three days, and I thought that it was finally stable, and we got all the way through ICC, Icecrown Citadel for those who don't know, and get to Arthas, and then it starts freezing on me, and I knew it was going to go down again.

36:12.124 --> 36:16.926
[SPEAKER_11]: And no porn torrents, so we really thank... I've already downloaded Supernatural.

36:17.446 --> 36:20.189
[SPEAKER_11]: We really thank the live listeners for tuning in and sticking it out.

36:20.209 --> 36:23.892
[SPEAKER_11]: We apologize we can't fix it but it is an issue with our internet service provider.

36:24.573 --> 36:28.056
[SPEAKER_11]: So for the sake of having a clean show we're just going to try and push right through.

36:28.436 --> 36:34.302
[SPEAKER_11]: If we go down we are probably aware so no need to send me 50 tells that we're down because we probably know.

36:35.862 --> 36:37.523
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I'll say this real quick.

36:38.163 --> 36:45.264
[SPEAKER_11]: Podcast Award results came out, and we didn't win, which, you know, you have to prepare yourself for the fact that you probably won't win.

36:46.064 --> 36:50.825
[SPEAKER_11]: The same show that won for the past couple years, Four Player Podcast, they won again, which is, you know, good for them.

36:50.926 --> 36:52.026
[SPEAKER_11]: They work hard on what they do.

36:52.226 --> 36:55.947
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an independent show, and we always said from the top, we won an indie show to win.

36:56.347 --> 36:58.747
[SPEAKER_11]: An indie show did win, so that's awesome.

36:58.947 --> 37:02.128
[SPEAKER_11]: And not only did they win the gaming one, they won the Grande...

37:03.228 --> 37:03.788
[SPEAKER_11]: TACO TACO TACO

37:29.699 --> 37:39.704
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that our community is any less because you guys, we were so thankful that you guys were putting out the call for retweets and posting on Facebook.

37:40.285 --> 37:44.347
[SPEAKER_11]: Other all-game shows were showing support for us, which really meant a lot, you guys.

37:44.487 --> 37:55.493
[SPEAKER_11]: We saw the plugs on other folks' website and the banners that were like, hey, our show is not nominated, but go vote for these guys because we like them and we're on the same network.

37:55.793 --> 37:56.914
[SPEAKER_11]: And that really meant a lot.

37:57.034 --> 38:26.609
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'll also say what also meant a lot to us throughout this whole thing that was awesome was that over on Facebook we actually posted you know the other night when we found out about the results we kind of you know said hey we didn't win but you know it's cool at least we were nominated you know out of what hundreds of gaming podcasts out there we were one of ten nominated and only half of them were general gaming shows a lot of them were very specialized shows about Warcraft or other MMOs or what have you so that was just really awesome to even have that

38:27.129 --> 38:30.612
[SPEAKER_11]: And the response we got on Facebook was just awesome.

38:30.632 --> 38:32.073
[SPEAKER_11]: We got some comments on the post.

38:33.454 --> 38:35.756
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, it's at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

38:35.776 --> 38:37.317
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're not our friend, you should add us.

38:37.557 --> 38:40.779
[SPEAKER_11]: Terry replied and said, You won my award and that's all that matters.

38:40.839 --> 38:42.721
[SPEAKER_11]: Six plus years and still listening.

38:43.501 --> 38:46.624
[SPEAKER_11]: Fabrice commented on the post saying, I'd even say you won our hearts.

38:46.724 --> 38:50.206
[SPEAKER_11]: Making such a great podcast for so many years is quite an accomplishment.

38:50.266 --> 38:51.627
[SPEAKER_11]: And stuff like that...

38:52.928 --> 38:54.829
[SPEAKER_06]: is... Makes my heart warm.

38:55.430 --> 38:57.070
[SPEAKER_11]: For just a moment, it does.

38:58.171 --> 39:00.452
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, stuff like that... Mine's longer than a moment.

39:00.512 --> 39:01.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, what are you thinking?

39:03.254 --> 39:05.975
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I just want to say thank you guys so much.

39:06.116 --> 39:08.537
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody who supported us, even though we didn't win.

39:10.052 --> 39:11.013
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all good.

39:11.273 --> 39:13.914
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still here and we don't have any plans to go anywhere.

39:14.074 --> 39:16.395
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we're broke.

39:17.376 --> 39:20.177
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's it for housekeeping.

39:20.758 --> 39:23.039
[SPEAKER_11]: As I mentioned, Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

39:23.079 --> 39:24.700
[SPEAKER_11]: Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

39:25.220 --> 39:26.380
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, the gaming news.

39:26.681 --> 39:26.921
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

39:27.984 --> 39:28.284
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes.

39:29.425 --> 39:37.490
[SPEAKER_09]: So, this week was pretty big, at least for me, because, hey, they put out a trailer for Grand Theft Auto V, and that makes me happy.

39:37.990 --> 39:44.595
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, the pretty easily guessed sequel to Grand Theft Auto IV.

39:45.515 --> 39:50.758
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's, of course, returning back to Los Santos as part of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

39:51.219 --> 39:54.461
[SPEAKER_09]: This time, I believe, though, it's supposed to be centralized more around...

39:55.021 --> 39:55.862
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:11.340 --> 40:12.121
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this going to be about?

40:12.161 --> 40:13.082
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are the new things in there?

40:13.482 --> 40:15.804
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the things that you see in the trailer, animals.

40:16.165 --> 40:18.747
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a dog, at least in a cut scene.

40:19.448 --> 40:26.714
[SPEAKER_09]: Not sure if you're going to be able to kill animals, but obviously in their last game, Red Dead Redemption, there were plenty of animals running around that you could kill.

40:26.754 --> 40:30.097
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be really risky for them to do that and incur the wrath of PETA.

40:30.177 --> 40:35.602
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know you guys don't care about that stuff, but that is a bunch of negative publicity I think the game could do without.

40:36.363 --> 40:36.743
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

40:58.382 --> 41:02.644
[SPEAKER_11]: People get very possessive about their cats and dogs, almost more so than they do people.

41:03.845 --> 41:05.725
[SPEAKER_07]: The PETA people are crazy anyway.

41:05.805 --> 41:06.926
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not just saying PETA.

41:07.206 --> 41:10.047
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're gonna work that stuff into the game, they better tread carefully.

41:10.087 --> 41:10.768
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I'm saying.

41:11.968 --> 41:14.049
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a volatile ground they're walking with that.

41:14.249 --> 41:18.372
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the other stuff, of course, planes coming back.

41:18.752 --> 41:20.493
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot more aircraft in there.

41:21.194 --> 41:22.554
[SPEAKER_09]: A blimp is in there.

41:22.615 --> 41:28.578
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows if you can fly a blimp, but definitely it was something that was part of the skyline.

41:28.638 --> 41:29.439
[SPEAKER_09]: That was kind of cool.

41:32.501 --> 41:34.923
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a huge variety of landscapes there.

41:35.263 --> 41:38.885
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything from the mountains to the city slums.

41:39.305 --> 41:42.928
[SPEAKER_09]: They showed three different characters in there that you might be playing as.

41:43.308 --> 41:48.912
[SPEAKER_09]: One of those, the rumor to be the main character from Vice City coming back.

41:49.613 --> 41:53.196
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also there looks like maybe CJ from San Andreas.

41:53.916 --> 41:58.460
[SPEAKER_09]: And then a new character all making the return maybe to this game.

41:58.940 --> 41:59.801
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

42:17.057 --> 42:18.739
[SPEAKER_09]: Just in time for the Wii U launch.

42:19.700 --> 42:22.842
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be good timing if they want a Grand Theft Auto on their platform.

42:22.862 --> 42:26.125
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, can I say this about the pet discussion we were having a minute ago?

42:26.425 --> 42:29.328
[SPEAKER_11]: AkumaJP in our chatroom says, don't worry, all dogs go to heaven.

42:30.782 --> 42:59.071
[SPEAKER_09]: that's true, that's true cats on the other hand no, I'm just kidding, I love kitties good thing Shermie's not in here all cats go to special heaven should make that face at you no, cats go to special heaven sorry Loki but yeah, it's seriously amazing if you haven't seen the trailer for whatever reason go check it out, rockstargames.com and I can't wait to play it it'll be awesome and how many times did you watch the trailer?

42:59.252 --> 42:59.792
[SPEAKER_09]: about 10-15 times

43:01.673 --> 43:04.757
[SPEAKER_11]: People are really dissecting even just every little frame of that.

43:05.018 --> 43:06.099
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of like a movie trailer, though.

43:06.300 --> 43:11.687
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some really stupid people out there that are like, Hey, hey, look at that address that's on there.

43:11.707 --> 43:13.289
[SPEAKER_09]: That meeting's just coming out in May.

43:13.329 --> 43:14.491
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, no, you're stupid.

43:15.533 --> 43:16.834
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a bit frightened now.

43:18.703 --> 43:21.265
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43:43.342 --> 43:51.525
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not usually the type of game we play, but there's a million, actually five million to be exact, people out there that are playing this game this week.

43:51.605 --> 43:52.486
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Battlefield 3.

43:53.646 --> 43:55.627
[SPEAKER_11]: It is huge in the gaming industry.

43:56.067 --> 44:00.089
[SPEAKER_11]: Five million gamers throughout the world bought Battlefield 3 this week.

44:00.769 --> 44:09.293
[SPEAKER_11]: That is internal estimates from EA, so that could be a little bit inflated, but to be honest, I wouldn't put it past that that is actually the legit number.

44:11.730 --> 44:12.671
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

44:35.430 --> 44:42.139
[SPEAKER_11]: And as far as the multiplayer experience goes, where you get to shoot, shoot, shoot to kill, it's a lot of fun.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.824
[SPEAKER_11]: But Loki, you're trying to get this right now?

44:46.064 --> 44:52.874
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was looking to maybe try it, at least the single player, because it looked fun.

44:53.823 --> 44:54.423
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

45:11.033 --> 45:14.695
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like there's a lot of rabble rabble about the Origin integration.

45:14.715 --> 45:18.397
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say I was reading something about a crack has already come out for the PC version.

45:18.737 --> 45:23.380
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, this wouldn't affect the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 ones, but the PC one specifically.

45:23.760 --> 45:27.102
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess a crack has come out that has now disabled the Origin.

45:27.142 --> 45:30.284
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need it anymore, which is not a surprise at all.

45:30.784 --> 45:31.385
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you this.

45:32.265 --> 45:36.586
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't talk about this at the top of the show, but you guys know my Xbox was hacked a couple months ago.

45:36.606 --> 45:37.426
[SPEAKER_11]: I talked about it on the show.

45:37.506 --> 45:37.987
[SPEAKER_11]: Lost some money.

45:39.587 --> 45:45.148
[SPEAKER_11]: I played the demo for Need for Speed The Run this week because that's the game I'm actually looking forward to.

45:45.749 --> 45:47.629
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't play a lot of EA Sports games.

45:47.929 --> 45:50.670
[SPEAKER_11]: The only EA Sports games I really get into these days are the racers.

45:52.119 --> 46:01.224
[SPEAKER_11]: So the reason why I bring that up, when I logged in to Need for Speed The Run, it told me that my Xbox Live gamer tag had already been tied to an email account that wasn't mine.

46:01.704 --> 46:02.845
[SPEAKER_11]: It belonged to somebody else.

46:02.925 --> 46:10.149
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, I was able to Facebook that person and see what she looked like and wonder if that was the person that maybe took my money.

46:10.189 --> 46:11.690
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, FIFA is an EA game.

46:12.250 --> 46:12.991
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know.

46:13.151 --> 46:14.012
[SPEAKER_11]: FIFA's an EA game.

46:14.052 --> 46:16.095
[SPEAKER_11]: And this person made the account on there.

46:16.555 --> 46:17.476
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I don't know.

46:17.496 --> 46:20.220
[SPEAKER_11]: The hacker could have just used a random email address.

46:20.420 --> 46:23.524
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was interesting that I was able to look this person up on Facebook.

46:23.544 --> 46:25.326
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you need to confirm it, though.

46:25.386 --> 46:26.367
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't know.

46:26.387 --> 46:26.768
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

46:29.030 --> 46:43.884
[SPEAKER_11]: I called EA to get that unattached to get my real EA account attached to my gamer tag because I wanted my actual one on there and I wanted that one unattached I was on hold for 25 minutes waiting to speak to somebody over there

46:45.669 --> 46:47.270
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:05.780 --> 47:33.013
[SPEAKER_11]: and my response was dude we told you change your password so people out there on Xbox please please change your password and this is what I'm going to honestly recommend you do go download the demo for either NBA Jam or Need for Speed The Run especially Need for Speed The Run if you like racer games like it all like check that one out because it's actually kind of rad like that snow level is pretty awesome check out the demo because when you play the demo you can attach

47:35.074 --> 47:51.745
[SPEAKER_11]: and I would think if you could do that in advance it might help against the hackers like I'm not sure again nobody knows what they're doing besides charging up these money I think they're loading up Xbox Live accounts and then trying to sell them or something so I don't know what it is they're really doing

47:52.345 --> 47:54.566
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's hard to say what measures to take to prevent it.

47:54.646 --> 47:55.126
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will say this.

47:55.146 --> 48:00.968
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what they're doing is I think is like you download that content to your console and then you don't need that account anymore.

48:00.988 --> 48:03.869
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like kind of downloading a full version of a game.

48:03.889 --> 48:04.349
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

48:05.069 --> 48:05.909
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say this.

48:06.590 --> 48:11.051
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody I know who got hacked, none of them play EA Sports games.

48:11.791 --> 48:13.872
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just an interesting trend I'm noticing.

48:14.472 --> 48:30.011
[SPEAKER_11]: so go get your Xbox Live account attached to an EA account I hate that I'm telling you to go sign up for an EA account because in a perfect world I would be saying clearly there's an issue here that nobody's admitting to which is infuriatingly difficult

48:30.692 --> 48:52.389
[SPEAKER_11]: but go do it because you don't want to lose $150 like one of our other listeners did this week so please please don't be like us change your Xbox Live password now if you haven't already and you know what take the extra precaution and attach an EA account to it through the Need for Speed to Run demo or any EA Sports demo that's out there there you go

48:53.730 --> 48:56.632
[SPEAKER_11]: Techness in our chat room disagrees with me.

48:56.912 --> 49:01.534
[SPEAKER_11]: Need for Speed the run looks horrible, but it uses the EA login for all their games via Origin.

49:02.175 --> 49:06.797
[SPEAKER_11]: I played it on 360, not PC, so I didn't have the whole Origin thing, but I kind of liked it.

49:06.877 --> 49:07.357
[SPEAKER_11]: It was cool.

49:07.377 --> 49:08.198
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

49:08.478 --> 49:09.919
[SPEAKER_11]: But I like racing games, too.

49:09.959 --> 49:11.239
[SPEAKER_11]: I like arcade racers like that.

49:11.319 --> 49:15.622
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't do Forza or Gran Turismo, but I can totally do Need for Speed and Burnout.

49:15.862 --> 49:16.522
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's just me.

49:18.103 --> 49:18.423
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

49:20.345 --> 49:22.789
[SPEAKER_11]: Akuma JP asks in our chatroom, is EA the hacker?

49:23.751 --> 49:24.232
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

49:24.352 --> 49:27.217
[SPEAKER_11]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com They do like money.

49:27.577 --> 49:29.500
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on with some more gaming news, DarkSakura.

49:30.029 --> 49:36.191
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as I mentioned earlier, this is a game that I've been playing, sort of, is DC Universe Online.

49:36.611 --> 49:45.875
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gone free to play, and it's been sending the game down for maintenance off and on, which I've actually run into myself.

49:47.415 --> 49:56.539
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can actually go download it through the Sega Online Entertainment Launcher, and the game's being revamped to handle the people.

49:57.519 --> 50:08.026
[SPEAKER_07]: and also their user numbers have hit 330,000 players which is a 600% increase.

50:09.527 --> 50:10.207
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty crazy.

50:11.508 --> 50:15.270
[SPEAKER_11]: Meaning that everybody went to check this game out the minute it went free to play.

50:16.030 --> 50:17.491
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I was curious.

50:17.772 --> 50:18.532
[SPEAKER_07]: I checked it out.

50:19.012 --> 50:19.873
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a lot of people that did.

50:20.113 --> 50:20.953
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't care for it.

50:20.973 --> 50:22.254
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to play it anymore.

50:22.594 --> 50:24.195
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wouldn't have paid for it.

50:24.255 --> 50:24.816
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you this.

50:25.016 --> 50:26.657
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have been really pissed if I had been paying for it.

50:27.327 --> 50:53.840
[SPEAKER_11]: I played it during the beta and I liked it enough where I would have played it more but I didn't want to be paying for multiple MMOs because I think at the time I was playing the beta I was playing for WoW and something else and I don't remember what it was but yeah I didn't want to add another one into the mix so I didn't go through with it and I was really happy when they announced they went free to play but then I heard the first day just that the servers are crashing left and right which doesn't surprise me well the login's taking forever and it would like freeze the loading your character

50:54.680 --> 50:56.941
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just like, you know what, this isn't worth it to me.

50:57.001 --> 51:04.063
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm already paying for one game that I like, and another game that I like is coming out free to play, so why am I worried?

51:04.883 --> 51:06.043
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll still check out DC Universe.

51:06.063 --> 51:08.564
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the idea that it's a console MMO.

51:09.024 --> 51:15.545
[SPEAKER_11]: I might get it on PS3, although all my friends are on PC, just because, I don't know, I like the idea of an MMO on my console.

51:16.806 --> 51:17.186
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of fun.

51:18.945 --> 51:26.313
[SPEAKER_11]: I like DC Universe well enough I'll check it out now, it's free to play I'm not as humbuggy Alright, let's move on with some more news

51:27.188 --> 51:41.616
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so this is kind of sad, I guess, but... Silicon Knights, so... Silicon Knights, they've cut their staff by nearly 75%, going from almost 100 people down to 25.

51:41.936 --> 51:50.501
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, they just released X-Men Destiny, which didn't really get that great reviews, and Two Human, which really didn't get good reviews.

51:51.041 --> 51:51.282
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

51:52.863 --> 51:57.646
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that might be a good reason why they're cutting.

51:59.427 --> 52:14.639
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, apparently it has been confirmed that they had those layoffs, although they're saying that the number is actually maybe a little bit lower than that because they're also creating new jobs as well.

52:15.359 --> 52:16.080
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

52:18.092 --> 52:18.432
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

52:18.872 --> 52:39.117
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting that these cuts have to happen, but I guess since they just finished the game and it didn't do that well, so they can't... Sadly, this is kind of what happens a lot lately, which doesn't make the news any better to report, but... Yeah, I mean, it's just...

52:40.697 --> 52:42.378
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not surprised.

52:43.358 --> 52:47.120
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought X-Men Destiny looked alright, but apparently it seemed rushed.

52:47.640 --> 53:03.946
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe that's not necessarily the fault of them, but I kind of think it might be a little bit... They're a little bit to blame, because look at 2 Human, a game that was delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed, and it still sucked when it came out.

53:04.466 --> 53:12.630
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know if more time would have actually helped them in this case, but probably didn't help that they were a little short in time.

53:12.790 --> 53:20.754
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the silver lining, though, is that a lot of times when these studios have these massive layoffs, the big people kind of go tend to form their own new company.

53:21.255 --> 53:23.536
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, that kind of happened with Bazaar recently, which I...

53:24.236 --> 53:27.878
[SPEAKER_11]: Still, I still cannot believe that they shut that studio down.

53:28.158 --> 53:29.099
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I do and I don't.

53:30.000 --> 53:30.700
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sad.

53:31.020 --> 53:32.741
[SPEAKER_11]: It was horrible.

53:33.121 --> 53:36.544
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, they go start a new company and it might turn out okay.

53:38.185 --> 53:40.886
[SPEAKER_09]: Another company that has some layoffs, Gameforge.

53:41.206 --> 53:45.169
[SPEAKER_09]: They're kind of known for doing some browser-based games.

53:45.669 --> 53:52.213
[SPEAKER_09]: But also, they dropped their staff from 450 down to 350 recently.

53:54.254 --> 54:17.923
[SPEAKER_09]: and of course they've recently cancelled a few different games, Mythos and Hellbreed and I guess they're not sure if they're going to be able to finish now it was supposed to be a free to play or freemium Star Trek game, Star Trek Infinite Space that they were going to be co-publishing I wonder if Star Trek Online going free to play somehow ended up being a conflict of interest with this

54:19.826 --> 54:20.566
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a random thought.

54:20.746 --> 54:21.007
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

54:21.027 --> 54:21.327
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

54:21.927 --> 54:22.287
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

54:22.307 --> 54:23.427
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it looks kind of cool.

54:24.208 --> 54:25.968
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know much about it, though.

54:26.088 --> 54:27.369
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of the first time I've heard of it.

54:28.409 --> 54:37.552
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, their comment is, through a more efficient, organized structure, we can optimize our use of resource and greater... Fluff, fluff, PR fluff.

54:37.592 --> 54:38.732
[SPEAKER_09]: Fluff, fluff, fluff.

54:38.752 --> 54:40.292
[SPEAKER_11]: Trying not to sound evil and terrible.

54:40.633 --> 54:41.253
[SPEAKER_11]: Fluff, fluff.

54:41.293 --> 54:47.335
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, which... It's all of, like, well, we've got to cut costs, so we're going to have less people doing more.

54:47.455 --> 54:48.455
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, you know...

54:49.318 --> 54:51.479
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard that one over and over and over again.

54:52.560 --> 54:53.881
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's unfortunate.

54:54.201 --> 54:56.862
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you get down to like five jobs per person, then yeah.

54:57.002 --> 55:04.306
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hope these guys maybe can team up with the other ones who just got laid off and hopefully start a new studio that makes some awesome things that's better managed.

55:04.907 --> 55:05.267
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hope.

55:06.772 --> 55:07.112
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hope.

55:08.413 --> 55:12.935
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyhow, moving on with some more game news that hopefully is a little less depressing.

55:13.856 --> 55:16.457
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you're a Sony fan, this is actually pretty exciting news.

55:16.637 --> 55:21.460
[SPEAKER_11]: The PlayStation 3 is catching up to the Xbox 360 in terms of shipments.

55:23.101 --> 55:49.942
[SPEAKER_11]: Q2 2011 it was reported that Sony has sold 3.7 million PS3 units around the world and that quarter ended September 30th so they have sold thus far 55.5 million units and they're improving Microsoft has 57.6 million shipped units worldwide so they're getting really neck and neck

55:50.642 --> 55:55.506
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony could overtake this number two position depending on how the holidays the next year goes.

55:56.787 --> 56:02.192
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep in mind, we don't know if these companies are talking about what's called sell-through or sell-in.

56:02.672 --> 56:05.074
[SPEAKER_11]: Sell-through means all the way to the consumer at home.

56:05.455 --> 56:08.217
[SPEAKER_11]: Sell-in means just on the retail shelves.

56:08.677 --> 56:09.998
[SPEAKER_11]: Either way, though, just, I mean...

56:10.999 --> 56:11.420
[SPEAKER_11]: BlueRay

56:26.101 --> 56:27.822
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

56:48.659 --> 56:51.160
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, the games are getting better on the system.

56:51.420 --> 56:54.682
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't have much for a while, and now they're really getting the good ones.

56:54.862 --> 56:58.183
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody in the gaming world gave PlayStation 3 shit when it came out.

56:58.383 --> 56:58.984
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody.

56:59.184 --> 57:01.385
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, except the very hardcore Sony fans.

57:01.785 --> 57:06.307
[SPEAKER_11]: It took them a long time, but now they've made steady progress to try and get better.

57:07.488 --> 57:11.970
[SPEAKER_11]: I still don't think everything is all roses and sunshine, like PlayStation Move.

57:13.810 --> 57:15.871
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they still trying with PlayStation Move, Loki?

57:15.951 --> 57:19.692
[SPEAKER_11]: Or did they finally just kind of shuffle it to the back?

57:19.732 --> 57:20.892
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're definitely still trying.

57:21.032 --> 57:21.752
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they?

57:22.853 --> 57:30.134
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got a bunch of new games coming out and new bundles to try to drive PlayStation Move stuff.

57:30.674 --> 57:32.795
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking at just the month of November, you've got

57:32.935 --> 57:34.015
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

57:55.744 --> 58:06.737
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a bundle with sports champions, Medieval Moves, Deadman's Quest, and then that game was also coming out by itself from Sony+.

58:07.257 --> 58:08.238
[SPEAKER_09]: iPet and Friends.

58:09.980 --> 58:12.662
[SPEAKER_09]: That is coming out as well if anyone gives a shit.

58:13.082 --> 58:16.164
[SPEAKER_09]: And kids.

58:16.184 --> 58:20.687
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got some new bundles and hardware stuff.

58:20.807 --> 58:23.409
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'm just kind of like poo-pooing the move.

58:23.429 --> 58:24.970
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of games that support it.

58:25.070 --> 58:27.091
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything I see is about Kinect.

58:27.572 --> 58:32.855
[SPEAKER_11]: And even then, like this year, I don't think Kinect's going to have the same impact this year as it did last year.

58:32.875 --> 58:39.560
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, if I had a choice between playing a Kinect game and a Move game of the same game, I'd rather play the Move game.

58:40.240 --> 58:44.884
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, it seems to be more accurate, you know, to me.

58:45.325 --> 58:50.789
[SPEAKER_09]: I really kind of want to play Child of Eden on the PS3 because I think that'd be awesome.

58:50.809 --> 58:52.591
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the move stuff, it seemed to work really well.

58:52.631 --> 58:54.072
[SPEAKER_09]: Connect sometimes is just kind of eh.

58:54.372 --> 58:56.174
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, the dancing games are pretty awesome.

58:56.314 --> 58:58.415
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I just can't really see myself playing.

58:58.636 --> 59:00.057
[SPEAKER_11]: It's becoming a one-trick pony.

59:00.097 --> 59:02.499
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nothing but the dancing games that are remarkable, you know?

59:02.919 --> 59:18.318
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, kinda, kinda, and a lot of the games, unfortunately, I think for, not so much with the move, because a lot of people are developing stuff for the move, kinda do stuff with the Wii, and they've kinda gotten over that phase of, hey, look, we're gonna make it, you know, where you can waggle to do different things instead of pushing a button, but...

59:19.224 --> 59:21.685
[SPEAKER_11]: How has the Kinect evolved a year later?

59:21.785 --> 59:24.527
[SPEAKER_11]: What are we seeing on the Kinect now that we didn't see a year ago?

59:25.127 --> 59:27.948
[SPEAKER_11]: Child of Eden and sequels to all the shit from last year.

59:27.968 --> 59:31.650
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't even call Child of Eden that new because it's just an on-rails shooter, basically.

59:31.730 --> 59:35.272
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but it was a type of game we didn't have last year.

59:35.772 --> 59:38.153
[SPEAKER_11]: But has Kinect really changed gaming?

59:39.801 --> 59:41.903
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition is stupid.

01:00:01.016 --> 01:00:02.057
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, look at me.

01:00:02.197 --> 01:00:05.559
[SPEAKER_09]: I can actually use the voice command to switch between old graphics and new graphics.

01:00:05.659 --> 01:00:06.380
[SPEAKER_09]: Who gives a fuck?

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.681
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that is stupid.

01:00:07.961 --> 01:00:09.562
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would I need to do that on the fly?

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:13.765
[SPEAKER_09]: Or why would I need to yell grenade when I can push a button and it does grenade?

01:00:13.865 --> 01:00:15.246
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's dumb.

01:00:16.266 --> 01:00:19.088
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, if they had head tracking or something like that for...

01:00:20.189 --> 01:00:27.233
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo, that'd be kind of cool where if you're moving your head, it moves the camera slightly so that there's a little bit more integration there.

01:00:27.633 --> 01:00:28.733
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that could be really cool.

01:00:28.773 --> 01:00:35.957
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're just, unfortunately, the head tracking stuff that they're doing, like with Forza 4 even, like looking left and right, that doesn't work.

01:00:36.477 --> 01:00:45.722
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you're moving your head a little bit and it's tracking your head and it changes the camera's perspective based on where your head is, that's kind of cool because that's a little bit of immersion there, but

01:00:47.136 --> 01:00:47.456
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:00:47.596 --> 01:00:49.618
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the stuff that they're doing right now is kind of useless.

01:00:49.738 --> 01:00:51.259
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, there's tons of dancing games.

01:00:51.559 --> 01:00:53.721
[SPEAKER_09]: There's tons of sports games.

01:00:54.081 --> 01:00:58.284
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just stuff you don't really... I don't know.

01:00:58.404 --> 01:01:00.065
[SPEAKER_09]: Dancing and sports games is pretty much it.

01:01:01.326 --> 01:01:03.287
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, PlayStation 3 is gaining a little ground.

01:01:03.428 --> 01:01:10.332
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got to admit, I don't want to blame the hack for this, but I don't know what to put my finger on it with.

01:01:10.372 --> 01:01:15.976
[SPEAKER_11]: But I got to say, all these games I've been buying lately, if there exist versions on the PlayStation 3 and the 360...

01:01:17.177 --> 01:01:18.058
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been getting them on the PS3

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:47.454
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta admit, I can't put my finger on it, but I've just been more drawn to my PS3 lately.

01:01:48.275 --> 01:01:48.795
[SPEAKER_11]: Owning both.

01:01:49.415 --> 01:01:51.116
[SPEAKER_11]: So this news doesn't really surprise me.

01:01:53.678 --> 01:01:54.739
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the better controller.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.981
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that weighs a lot more than you think.

01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:00.882
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, Skyrim pre-ordered on PS3.

01:02:00.962 --> 01:02:06.005
[SPEAKER_07]: I do actually have to say that the PS3 controller is actually just a slightly bit more comfortable.

01:02:07.186 --> 01:02:08.947
[SPEAKER_07]: For my injured hand.

01:02:09.467 --> 01:02:13.569
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate that Microsoft has not changed that goddamn hideous D-pad.

01:02:13.689 --> 01:02:15.630
[SPEAKER_11]: Outside of special edition bullshit.

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:16.370
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't count.

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:20.032
[SPEAKER_09]: The D-pad's alright and even the special edition stuff didn't really help.

01:02:20.432 --> 01:02:22.873
[SPEAKER_09]: But the controllers are alright.

01:02:22.993 --> 01:02:31.096
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't really give a crap about the... Or I don't really care for the convex trigger buttons that are on the PlayStation 3.

01:02:31.136 --> 01:02:31.196
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

01:02:32.717 --> 01:02:33.178
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:37.161
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't really stop me from playing different games on these consoles.

01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:40.844
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, I don't play anything on the PS3.

01:02:40.884 --> 01:02:47.749
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm going to buy a game, it's because I don't really play with a lot of people on the PS3 online.

01:02:48.229 --> 01:02:49.991
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't do it.

01:02:51.492 --> 01:02:55.455
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just too bad because I've got a lot of games that I have on the PS3 that I haven't played yet.

01:02:56.036 --> 01:02:59.199
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to Salacious Pop in our chat room at chat.orange.com.

01:02:59.259 --> 01:03:05.304
[SPEAKER_11]: Salacious Pop says, Connect has actually turned out to be a great utility for special needs people, the deaf, mobility issues, whatever.

01:03:05.604 --> 01:03:08.707
[SPEAKER_11]: But as a household hardcore entertainment device, I don't think it really succeeded.

01:03:08.967 --> 01:03:11.089
[SPEAKER_11]: But the technology is really important in my opinion.

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:13.451
[SPEAKER_11]: The blind, not the deaf, he meant to say.

01:03:15.672 --> 01:03:22.094
[SPEAKER_11]: I get that and that's great and I do think the Kinect has made a lot of progress for accessibility issues.

01:03:22.114 --> 01:03:24.475
[SPEAKER_11]: It has had a lot of the iOS stuff that's come out lately.

01:03:25.555 --> 01:03:26.455
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Siri and all that.

01:03:26.635 --> 01:03:29.676
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's not what Microsoft's selling it as.

01:03:31.657 --> 01:03:35.558
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of feel like Microsoft hasn't delivered on what they promised it to us as.

01:03:35.798 --> 01:03:42.980
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great, but just because that happens to be a great perk about it doesn't mean that

01:03:43.516 --> 01:03:57.817
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, Microsoft's really delivered on their promise of changing gaming you know, I don't know alright, anyhow, I guess we'll move on to some more news DarkSakura well how about something about the 3DS that might be good news

01:03:59.299 --> 01:04:00.799
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario 3D Land.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.140
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually already out in Japan, I believe.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.241
[SPEAKER_07]: And they say that it's got new firmware for the system.

01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:16.663
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's basically supposed to make your friend list more functional so you can join in a friend's game that's already in progress just with pressing a button.

01:04:17.783 --> 01:04:24.445
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually just a brand new firmware system.

01:04:25.916 --> 01:04:27.117
[SPEAKER_07]: As opposed to the scheduled one, I think.

01:04:27.237 --> 01:04:31.699
[SPEAKER_11]: So now the 3DS is caught up to only being about six years behind in online gaming technology.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.241
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

01:04:34.321 --> 01:04:35.962
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's good to see them making progress forward.

01:04:36.282 --> 01:04:37.643
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a little progress.

01:04:38.443 --> 01:04:43.026
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're not sure if it's going to be out for the US one, but they're still waiting on hearing from Nintendo.

01:04:44.848 --> 01:04:45.909
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think it would be.

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:50.354
[SPEAKER_09]: It is going to be on the US one, thanks to reviewers of the US copy already.

01:04:51.095 --> 01:04:58.743
[SPEAKER_09]: And not only does it do all that fancy stuff, it of course stops piracy.

01:04:59.344 --> 01:05:02.467
[SPEAKER_11]: You betcha that Skyward Sword on the Wii, when is that out by the way?

01:05:02.507 --> 01:05:03.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that out today or is that next week?

01:05:03.989 --> 01:05:05.290
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a while.

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:06.231
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:30.474
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:05:46.025 --> 01:06:00.878
[SPEAKER_09]: well yeah I mean if you connect to even a system update stuff you're gonna you know get those but I don't think any of that's gonna really matter it usually they I mean they could I guess do that but I don't think that they're going to

01:06:01.338 --> 01:06:04.059
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I'm just kind of curious here.

01:06:06.039 --> 01:06:09.320
[SPEAKER_09]: Just see, I'm wondering if Skyward Sword's already leaked out.

01:06:10.521 --> 01:06:14.882
[SPEAKER_07]: On top of that, it's not like people aren't going to find another way.

01:06:15.782 --> 01:06:17.023
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I wouldn't be too worried.

01:06:17.723 --> 01:06:20.864
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's just one of those things I think is interesting, that's all.

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:22.251
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, they could.

01:06:22.291 --> 01:06:23.852
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that'd be a good game for them to do it on.

01:06:23.932 --> 01:06:26.172
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, to be honest, though.

01:06:26.272 --> 01:06:27.393
[SPEAKER_09]: The PSP did that a lot.

01:06:27.413 --> 01:06:30.033
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest with you, Rob, I don't think they give a shit anymore.

01:06:30.814 --> 01:06:31.514
[SPEAKER_09]: You think?

01:06:31.894 --> 01:06:32.634
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they care.

01:06:33.034 --> 01:06:35.235
[SPEAKER_09]: I think at this point they're like, okay, well, you've done enough.

01:06:35.255 --> 01:06:35.895
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't know.

01:06:35.955 --> 01:06:36.875
[SPEAKER_11]: We got a story coming up.

01:06:36.935 --> 01:06:37.275
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:06:37.435 --> 01:06:38.015
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, Loki.

01:06:38.035 --> 01:06:38.416
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

01:06:38.636 --> 01:06:40.016
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're already moved on to the Wii U.

01:06:40.256 --> 01:06:41.497
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk more about it when we get there.

01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:46.880
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you're wrong, and I was surprised to hear it too, but let's move on with the release dates.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:55.005
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to travel around the world and check out what is coming out to a store near you, and as it is early November, there's going to be a lot, right, Loki?

01:06:55.285 --> 01:06:55.625
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

01:06:56.246 --> 01:07:05.475
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I was telling you before how Activision gets behind really stupid toy things for the DS, we have two of them actually coming out today.

01:07:05.915 --> 01:07:10.339
[SPEAKER_09]: Moshi Monsters, Moshling Zoo on Nintendo DS, and Lalalupsi.

01:07:10.539 --> 01:07:10.779
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.801
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I don't understand what they are.

01:07:12.861 --> 01:07:16.503
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't Lala Loopsie one of the Tinky Winky or one of the Teletubbies?

01:07:16.723 --> 01:07:18.424
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not Teletubby.

01:07:18.644 --> 01:07:19.785
[SPEAKER_09]: Lala was a Teletubby.

01:07:19.885 --> 01:07:20.545
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do I know that?

01:07:20.725 --> 01:07:21.386
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you know that?

01:07:21.426 --> 01:07:22.506
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why I know that.

01:07:22.987 --> 01:07:25.488
[SPEAKER_09]: My head's full of random trivia.

01:07:26.289 --> 01:07:32.212
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, so that is some weird toy that's popular nowadays, some loop doll things.

01:07:32.853 --> 01:07:33.373
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, whatever.

01:07:33.714 --> 01:07:37.236
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, let's cheer for Xbox 360 and Kinect.

01:07:38.477 --> 01:07:40.419
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a game that's for Kinect.

01:07:41.019 --> 01:07:45.382
[SPEAKER_09]: Metal Gear Solid HD Collection on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

01:07:47.444 --> 01:07:50.907
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultimate Card Games by Telegames on Nintendo DS.

01:07:51.207 --> 01:07:51.807
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hilarious.

01:07:51.827 --> 01:07:53.428
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit of trivia here.

01:07:54.249 --> 01:07:57.552
[SPEAKER_09]: This game is like one of the only games this company is making.

01:07:57.692 --> 01:07:59.073
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been delayed for four years.

01:07:59.393 --> 01:07:59.833
[SPEAKER_09]: Four years.

01:07:59.933 --> 01:08:00.614
[SPEAKER_09]: Four years.

01:08:00.934 --> 01:08:04.155
[SPEAKER_09]: and literally up till the last minute it keeps getting delayed.

01:08:05.616 --> 01:08:08.057
[SPEAKER_09]: Although they claim that it's actually going to release this week.

01:08:08.077 --> 01:08:09.197
[SPEAKER_10]: The hell's the problem?

01:08:09.498 --> 01:08:11.018
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a stupid card game.

01:08:11.398 --> 01:08:14.380
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand how you develop a card game for four years.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.661
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a part of a Game Boy Advance game.

01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:18.081
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one guy working there.

01:08:18.401 --> 01:08:19.502
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, it's one guy.

01:08:20.622 --> 01:08:22.323
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's been in the bathroom half the time.

01:08:22.901 --> 01:08:27.282
[SPEAKER_09]: Champion Jockey, G1 Jockey, and Gallop Racer on the Wii and PlayStation 3 this week.

01:08:28.262 --> 01:08:29.482

[SPEAKER_09]: Get Up and Dance on the Wii and PlayStation 3 for the move.

01:08:34.603 --> 01:08:36.024
[SPEAKER_09]: Cars 2 on PSP.

01:08:37.244 --> 01:08:40.064
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony is so desperate for product on the PSP.

01:08:40.104 --> 01:08:43.985
[SPEAKER_09]: They're literally publishing the Disney Interactive game for the PSP.

01:08:48.146 --> 01:09:14.941
[SPEAKER_09]: because there's not a lot coming out on the PSP Bakugan Rise of the Resistance on Nintendo DS Self Defense Training Camp from Ubisoft on the Kinect Bass Pro Strike the bundle they have that coming out on the Wii and Little Big Planet Special Edition the Move Bundle like I was mentioning earlier that's coming out as well as the game by itself

[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

01:10:14.199 --> 01:10:15.620
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on DS on the Wii.

01:10:15.921 --> 01:10:20.884
[SPEAKER_09]: And to go along with that, the perfect companion piece to that, Jaws the Ultimate Predator on Wii and 3DS.

01:10:21.745 --> 01:10:23.907
[SPEAKER_09]: A game that you need to... Does it yet again have the niche?

01:10:23.927 --> 01:10:25.228
[SPEAKER_11]: You get to play as the shark.

01:10:25.328 --> 01:10:25.808
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it does.

01:10:26.269 --> 01:10:26.489

[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't had a Rabbids game yet.

[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this is that one music game.

[SPEAKER_11]: I have heard about this.

01:14:08.147 --> 01:14:15.129
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like Guitaroo Man meets Anime Babes, kind of.

01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:18.571
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where that quartet theme came from.

01:14:18.591 --> 01:14:19.071

01:15:01.405 --> 01:15:06.567
[SPEAKER_11]: This cheetah wants nothing to do with the rest of this cute fuckery that's going on in the rest of the picture.

01:15:08.068 --> 01:15:10.109
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you put that on the Tumblr if I link you to that?

01:15:11.490 --> 01:15:11.930
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.

01:15:19.754 --> 01:15:20.174
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.

[SPEAKER_11]: Da yeah.

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:31.299
[SPEAKER_07]: The damn thing will ever pull up.

01:15:31.579 --> 01:15:33.080
[SPEAKER_11]: Cheetah's saying to no.

01:15:34.081 --> 01:15:35.662
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, on the Sony PSP.

01:15:35.782 --> 01:15:36.763
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, I already read PSP.

01:15:36.823 --> 01:15:37.243
[SPEAKER_11]: Herp derp.

01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:39.344
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it this week for releases then.

01:15:39.385 --> 01:15:40.425
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really it.

01:15:42.907 --> 01:15:45.609
[SPEAKER_11]: The Vita to look forward to on December 17th, though, in Japan.

01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:46.689
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, they're getting it this year.

01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:51.172
[SPEAKER_11]: Before you get to Tumblr, how about the UK release date, StarSakra?

01:15:51.732 --> 01:15:54.554
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, give me a second.

01:15:55.135 --> 01:15:57.796
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the 8th, we have... They changed everything on me.

01:15:58.057 --> 01:15:58.497
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare they?

01:15:58.977 --> 01:16:03.261
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 Fighting Fantasy The Warlock of Firetop Mountain Cave Story 3D L.A.

01:16:03.301 --> 01:16:04.903
[SPEAKER_07]: Noire The Complete Edition My Self-Defense Coach

01:16:19.917 --> 01:16:29.427
[SPEAKER_07]: and Shinobi, Black Eyed Peas Experience, Skyrim on 360 PC, PlayStation 3, Your Shape, Fitness Evolved 2012, and that's it.

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:35.836
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm going to post stuff on my channel.

01:17:03.257 --> 01:17:04.818
[SPEAKER_11]: But a couple more news stories first.

01:17:04.878 --> 01:17:06.419
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

01:17:06.579 --> 01:17:06.899
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:17:07.439 --> 01:17:12.402
[SPEAKER_09]: So Nintendo, of course, they have a lot of patents for weird shit for the Wii and other systems.

01:17:12.942 --> 01:17:20.926
[SPEAKER_09]: This one is a device that's basically a touchpad attachment and looks as stupid as it pretty much could get.

01:17:21.166 --> 01:17:25.208
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically this thing that looks like a periscope.

01:17:26.048 --> 01:17:54.343
[SPEAKER_09]: and it would attach to the bottom of or actually it looks like the top of the Wii Remote somehow and you would I guess interact with the Wii Remote's IR sensor using it would detect where your fingers are using this like mirror thing almost like using the infrared camera that's in the remote as like some sort of camera for your finger positions

01:17:55.323 --> 01:18:00.165
[SPEAKER_09]: So think of it like, you know, instead of looking at the infrared lights that are on the little sensor bar, it looks at your fingers.

01:18:02.045 --> 01:18:03.326
[SPEAKER_09]: But it looks so stupid.

01:18:03.946 --> 01:18:05.647
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, so, so very stupid.

01:18:06.787 --> 01:18:09.148
[SPEAKER_09]: But, neat, I guess?

01:18:09.228 --> 01:18:11.609
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really know what this would be used for.

01:18:12.449 --> 01:18:16.330
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying that it describes it like a mouse pointer or something like that.

01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:18.611
[SPEAKER_09]: But, man, it looks so stupid!

01:18:18.991 --> 01:18:20.352
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously.

01:18:20.533 --> 01:18:22.654
[SPEAKER_09]: Not ergonomically friendly at all.

01:18:22.735 --> 01:18:27.719
[SPEAKER_11]: This means that something's in the works for Nintendo that isn't Wii U, or is it?

01:18:28.039 --> 01:18:31.502
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this, I guess, because the Wii U is going to be the same controller, so maybe it is.

01:18:31.603 --> 01:18:31.943
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

01:18:32.123 --> 01:18:37.048
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be, but it looks like it folds down, too, so you don't have to use it all the time, but

01:18:37.748 --> 01:18:46.671
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, you know, that's kind of neat that you can use it as like a touchpad, but at the same time, I mean, Wii Remote navigates those menus just fine.

01:18:46.712 --> 01:18:49.773
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we really need to add more to it.

01:18:52.314 --> 01:18:52.694
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:18:54.352 --> 01:18:54.693
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:18:55.113 --> 01:19:02.864
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, also speaking of the Wii, and this is what I was referring to earlier, Loki, when I said, I don't know, they're swearing that there's more coming for the Wii.

01:19:03.986 --> 01:19:10.935
[SPEAKER_11]: Reggie Fils-Aimé was actually on records this week saying that Zelda Skyward Sword is not the last great game on the Wii.

01:19:12.176 --> 01:19:21.239
[SPEAKER_11]: In an interview with a Brazilian site, which was posted on the internet, he was asked the question, what's next for the Wii after Skyward Sword?

01:19:21.579 --> 01:19:23.199
[SPEAKER_11]: And he said, more good games.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.121
[SPEAKER_11]: Many people ask me if Zelda Skyward Sword is the last great game for the Wii, and the answer is no.

01:19:28.541 --> 01:19:32.502
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about upcoming games for the Wii in late December or early January.

01:19:32.602 --> 01:19:34.703
[SPEAKER_11]: Cough, cough, after the holiday shopping season.

01:19:35.714 --> 01:19:58.124
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah let's talk about that this okay this could be just fucking fluff like it could be like whoopty shit Mario Tennis 27 or something you know like of course what's he gonna say sadly we don't have any good games coming out but we do have some great filler let's talk about you know thank you Reggie let's talk about what's coming out in December and January shall we

01:19:58.869 --> 01:20:00.971
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great discussion topic right there.

01:20:01.632 --> 01:20:02.934
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about what's coming on the Wii.

01:20:03.234 --> 01:20:07.578
[SPEAKER_09]: We have The Adventures of Tintin, a tie-in game to an animated movie.

01:20:07.719 --> 01:20:08.239
[SPEAKER_09]: No one care.

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.241
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, the French love Tintin.

01:20:10.682 --> 01:20:12.383
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have... No one care.

01:20:12.484 --> 01:20:16.428
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we have, of course, the game from Nintendo themselves, Fortune Street.

01:20:16.608 --> 01:20:21.433
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, like Mario Party, but with the Dragon Quest characters and the Mario characters in there.

01:20:22.476 --> 01:20:23.057
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

01:20:31.914 --> 01:20:36.355
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sure there's some games coming out or something, but not anything notable.

01:20:36.555 --> 01:20:37.155
[SPEAKER_11]: For the Wii.

01:20:37.175 --> 01:20:38.955
[SPEAKER_11]: 3DS maybe, but the Wii, no.

01:20:38.975 --> 01:20:40.336
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not even the 3DS.

01:20:40.356 --> 01:20:42.276
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Mario Kart 7 for the 3DS.

01:20:42.856 --> 01:20:46.797
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also think that they have a version of Adventures of Tintin.

01:20:47.257 --> 01:20:52.398
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, if you give me a couple seconds here, I can tell you exactly what's coming out.

01:20:52.418 --> 01:20:52.618
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-1000, 2-1000.

01:20:52.638 --> 01:20:53.718
[SPEAKER_09]: Not literally a second there.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:02.702
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, I haven't bought a game on the Wii in four years.

01:21:03.363 --> 01:21:05.464
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft says, I care about Tintin.

01:21:06.244 --> 01:21:06.785
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay for you.

01:21:07.445 --> 01:21:09.266
[SPEAKER_11]: This is me giving a fuck for you right now.

01:21:11.568 --> 01:21:13.209
[SPEAKER_11]: Tintin is awesome.

01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:16.351
[SPEAKER_11]: Techness in our chatroom says, it's not the last.

01:21:16.451 --> 01:21:17.932
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the only great game.

01:21:18.012 --> 01:21:18.552
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saying.

01:21:20.825 --> 01:21:23.426
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, it's... Thank you, SSJ100Matt.

01:21:23.726 --> 01:21:24.986
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm throwing shade at Tintin.

01:21:25.006 --> 01:21:26.387
[SPEAKER_11]: It has nothing to do with the movie.

01:21:27.147 --> 01:21:30.068
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, you know the game is not going to be anything to scream about.

01:21:30.148 --> 01:21:30.728
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's be real.

01:21:30.808 --> 01:21:32.689
[SPEAKER_11]: How often are movie games that good?

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.649
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

01:21:34.249 --> 01:21:34.689
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

01:21:34.749 --> 01:21:35.910
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not very good.

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:38.831
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, okay.

01:21:39.191 --> 01:21:40.832
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Alpha Kanatagram brings up a good point.

01:21:40.872 --> 01:21:48.496
[SPEAKER_11]: You're throwing shade at all this December and January stuff, but he said, let's meet up in December or January and then we'll talk.

01:21:48.596 --> 01:21:54.899
[SPEAKER_11]: Meaning that maybe they're announcing more plans in December for what's coming in January.

01:21:55.239 --> 01:22:02.123
[SPEAKER_11]: Which a lot of people are taking to mean, OMG, it's Last Story and Xenoblade and Pandora's Tower.

01:22:03.717 --> 01:22:04.798
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:22:22.412 --> 01:22:23.033
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

01:22:23.554 --> 01:22:26.378
[SPEAKER_09]: 3DS also had Dr. Loric in The Forgotten Knights.

01:22:26.438 --> 01:22:28.320
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a Dr. Laura game coming on 3DS?

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.442
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Loric.

01:22:29.782 --> 01:22:30.543
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Dr. Laura.

01:22:30.583 --> 01:22:33.728
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Loric and the complete knockoff of Professor Layton.

01:22:35.345 --> 01:22:37.146
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and National Geographic Challenge.

01:22:37.306 --> 01:22:38.026
[SPEAKER_09]: My mistake.

01:22:38.546 --> 01:22:39.547
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii is saved.

01:22:40.867 --> 01:22:41.968
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii is saved.

01:22:42.008 --> 01:22:49.350
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of release dates, Nintendo is on record that they are purposely holding back some of their upcoming 3DS games.

01:22:49.791 --> 01:22:53.552
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be releasing them in 2012 because it will maximize sales.

01:22:53.892 --> 01:22:56.013
[SPEAKER_11]: This actually makes sense though, to be honest.

01:22:56.033 --> 01:23:00.114
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to release everything right now because then the games are all diluted or whatever.

01:23:00.154 --> 01:23:01.034
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

01:23:01.154 --> 01:23:05.635
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait for what other Nintendo 64 game they're going to fucking port over to the 3DS.

01:23:05.695 --> 01:23:10.057
[SPEAKER_11]: Now hold on, hold on, because we know there's Luigi's Mansion 2.

01:23:10.797 --> 01:23:13.178
[SPEAKER_11]: We know there's the Kid Icarus game that they showed off.

01:23:13.198 --> 01:23:14.518
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Kid Icarus is coming.

01:23:14.658 --> 01:23:18.219
[SPEAKER_11]: And then wasn't there another big one that they had announced that got pushed back?

01:23:18.897 --> 01:23:20.739
[SPEAKER_11]: Who gives a crap about Luigi's Mansion?

01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:22.640
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one was kind of poo.

01:23:23.061 --> 01:23:23.881
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of looks cool.

01:23:24.022 --> 01:23:24.342
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:23:25.463 --> 01:23:26.123
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't spend $30 on it.

01:23:26.143 --> 01:23:29.346
[SPEAKER_07]: The only cool part was when you ran into the shadow that looked like it was hanging Luigi.

01:23:29.887 --> 01:23:35.652
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe they've incorporated elements of Silent Hill and Luigi will be horribly murdered by some of the ghosts.

01:23:36.432 --> 01:23:37.473
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody can dream anyway.

01:23:38.014 --> 01:23:38.614
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd pay for that.

01:23:38.874 --> 01:23:40.216
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me read you the quote here.

01:23:40.236 --> 01:23:41.156
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to hear something funny?

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:41.537
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:46.441
[SPEAKER_09]: There is absolutely no Wii games announced for January at this point.

01:23:49.475 --> 01:23:50.675
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let me see here.

01:23:51.236 --> 01:23:59.963
[SPEAKER_11]: For us to provide software titles one after another, one idea is, isn't it possible for Nintendo to stock some of its software titles instead of launching them as soon as the development is completed?

01:24:00.343 --> 01:24:11.452
[SPEAKER_11]: Video games need to stay fresh, so it is not practical for us to put them on hold for too long, but we think that some of them may be held for a certain amount of time so that there will be a short interval between when they are completed and when they are launched.

01:24:11.912 --> 01:24:14.553
[SPEAKER_11]: We are taking on this sort of challenge for the Nintendo 3DS.

01:24:14.913 --> 01:24:23.336
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, when we look at the software lineup for the year-end sales season, it is so dense that if we added any more software, the total sales would not increase.

01:24:23.716 --> 01:24:28.458
[SPEAKER_11]: Accordingly, we have intentionally delayed the launch of some software titles to early next year.

01:24:29.078 --> 01:24:30.618
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I'm not surprised by this.

01:24:32.299 --> 01:24:33.539
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the strategy.

01:24:33.979 --> 01:24:38.341
[SPEAKER_11]: Most people buy the game the week it comes out or they don't buy it at all or they buy it used.

01:24:42.208 --> 01:24:42.708
[SPEAKER_11]: What, Loki?

01:24:44.609 --> 01:24:44.949
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

01:24:45.469 --> 01:24:48.809
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see that they're going to have any... It's going to be something retarded.

01:24:49.109 --> 01:24:55.211
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry that they're going to put out... It's their last big game.

01:24:55.451 --> 01:24:55.991
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

01:24:56.171 --> 01:25:03.092
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really not going to be any last big game because if it's really, really, really good, they're going to fucking port that shit to the Wii U. True.

01:25:03.933 --> 01:25:05.633
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they did with Zelda Twilight Princess.

01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:09.614
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, I don't know.

01:25:09.715 --> 01:25:16.567
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, okay, Nintendo's got a few games coming out, but I don't think it's going to be anything like, oh my god, this is the greatest game I've ever played.

01:25:18.524 --> 01:25:25.008
[SPEAKER_11]: Still though, I gotta say, again, I've played Xenoblade, and it is pretty good, and it is ridiculous that that game is not out in the US.

01:25:25.128 --> 01:25:26.389
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no reason it shouldn't be out here.

01:25:26.409 --> 01:25:45.601
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of games that they localize for Europe regions that, there was the one, it was Disaster Day and Crisis or something like that, that came out over in Japan, and it came out over in Europe, and they completely localized it, and it was Nintendo published, and they just, nah, we're not gonna bring it over here.

01:25:45.801 --> 01:25:46.802
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me ask this question.

01:25:47.967 --> 01:25:48.527
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:26:09.978 --> 01:26:12.721
[SPEAKER_11]: Not porting these games I think could be seen as a bad decision.

01:26:13.261 --> 01:26:17.406
[SPEAKER_11]: The shareholders, very pissed off that they won't make iPhone games.

01:26:17.426 --> 01:26:18.347
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the problem, though.

01:26:18.587 --> 01:26:20.069
[SPEAKER_09]: Who gives a fuck what the shareholders want?

01:26:20.089 --> 01:26:20.930
[SPEAKER_09]: They're stupid, okay?

01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:23.092
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, no, no, no, hold on.

01:26:23.112 --> 01:26:25.275
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, do you hear what you're saying?

01:26:25.635 --> 01:26:26.436
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

01:26:42.611 --> 01:26:44.894
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me help my competition.

01:26:45.655 --> 01:26:48.238
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's give people more reasons not to buy our systems.

01:26:48.258 --> 01:26:50.081
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to put our games on other systems.

01:26:50.401 --> 01:26:51.282
[SPEAKER_09]: That's stupid.

01:26:53.085 --> 01:26:58.813
[SPEAKER_11]: The real answer is though, if the Wii U sucks, Nintendo is going to go the way of Sega.

01:26:59.605 --> 01:27:01.006
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to go the way of Sega.

01:27:01.026 --> 01:27:03.667
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to lay low for a while and then come out with another system.

01:27:03.687 --> 01:27:09.690
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to go the way they did with, like, Nintendo 64 and the GameCube, where it just didn't do that hot.

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:11.291
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll survive.

01:27:11.391 --> 01:27:12.231
[SPEAKER_09]: People will buy it.

01:27:12.391 --> 01:27:14.132
[SPEAKER_09]: Because people eat up gimmicks.

01:27:14.412 --> 01:27:16.213
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why Skylanders is doing alright.

01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:18.074
[SPEAKER_09]: Because people eat up gimmicks.

01:27:19.155 --> 01:27:22.296
[SPEAKER_09]: And by doing well, I mean they've sold 20,000 copies per platform.

01:27:22.436 --> 01:27:23.697
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is not very well.

01:27:24.477 --> 01:27:25.638
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um...

01:27:27.259 --> 01:27:27.599
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.541
[SPEAKER_09]: I think though it's stupid if their shareholders want them to make iPhone games.

01:27:31.961 --> 01:27:38.865
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not stupid that they shouldn't have some cheaper priced games on their marketplace to drive sales that way.

01:27:39.325 --> 01:27:45.308
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I do think they should get into a market where they have some 99 cent games because I think that's what people eat up.

01:27:45.989 --> 01:27:47.890
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're more likely to purchase that stuff.

01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:52.172
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the quality might not be as good as your Nintendo games, but

01:27:54.381 --> 01:27:55.481
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that they're okay.

01:27:55.861 --> 01:27:56.382
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

01:27:56.442 --> 01:27:58.862
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people like Angry Birds.

01:27:59.102 --> 01:28:01.583
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, a lot of people like Angry Birds and that kind of stuff.

01:28:01.603 --> 01:28:02.803
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are 99 cent games.

01:28:03.463 --> 01:28:05.984
[SPEAKER_09]: Or even like Fruit Ninja.

01:28:06.584 --> 01:28:11.806
[SPEAKER_09]: Simple concept stuff that doesn't take much to develop and you sell it for a cheap price and people get addicted to that shit.

01:28:12.306 --> 01:28:13.806
[SPEAKER_09]: And you sell tons of download content.

01:28:14.526 --> 01:28:20.228
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's stupid for them to be expected to make iOS games.

01:28:20.268 --> 01:28:21.108
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just dumb.

01:28:21.536 --> 01:28:24.797
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I could see them maybe coming out with some good games.

01:28:25.817 --> 01:28:31.519
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, the bring over, the last story and stuff like that, even though it's sometimes like, oh man, this is going to do really well.

01:28:31.579 --> 01:28:34.380
[SPEAKER_09]: All these hardcore fans are really into these games.

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:35.420
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they missed the boat.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.180
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:49.865
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that they've seen what these companies, like Mad World and stuff like that, these games that are appealing to the hardcore crowd, and they just don't make sense for them to bring over because to publish them, it's just expensive to bring it over here.

01:28:49.905 --> 01:28:50.105
[SPEAKER_09]: Now,

01:28:51.645 --> 01:29:02.255
[SPEAKER_09]: At the same time, I don't know why they've brought over some of the Dragon Quest games and stuff like that, because I think those are appealing to a hardcore audience, but I don't think they sell that well.

01:29:02.335 --> 01:29:04.437
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're not selling millions of copies of these things.

01:29:04.897 --> 01:29:08.821
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, we're going to close with this thought here from our chatroom at chat.orangeonestradio.com.

01:29:08.941 --> 01:29:12.344
[SPEAKER_11]: Kaijudo says, Nintendo has been in the game too long to fall.

01:29:12.625 --> 01:29:13.205
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be back.

01:29:14.366 --> 01:29:14.767
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

01:29:14.987 --> 01:29:15.247
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:29:16.168 --> 01:29:20.672
[SPEAKER_11]: Ironically enough, we're going to lead into the classic game of the week, which was picked before tonight's show.

01:29:20.732 --> 01:29:21.833
[SPEAKER_11]: Just keep that in mind.

01:29:22.754 --> 01:29:34.504
[SPEAKER_11]: A time when gaming life was simpler and, you know, we didn't have all this talk and podcasts that would be cynical about what the shareholders want and all that stuff for these companies.

01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:36.482
[SPEAKER_11]: We just played games!

01:29:36.682 --> 01:29:40.505
[SPEAKER_07]: When we were still in high school and would hide in our room and play it all day.

01:29:40.665 --> 01:29:45.668
[SPEAKER_11]: So DarkSakura, when you were in high school, what game did you go in and play all day?

01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:50.672
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario World, which I was so surprised we haven't done before.

01:29:50.692 --> 01:29:51.692
[SPEAKER_07]: I could have swore we did.

01:29:51.712 --> 01:29:52.553
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought we did too.

01:29:52.693 --> 01:29:56.936
[SPEAKER_07]: It did Super Mario World 2, which was Mario's island, wasn't it?

01:29:57.196 --> 01:29:57.416
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:29:57.697 --> 01:29:59.658
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was not nearly as fun as this one.

01:29:59.898 --> 01:30:01.339
[SPEAKER_09]: Yoshi's Island was... Yoshi's Island.

01:30:01.379 --> 01:30:02.280
[SPEAKER_09]: It was alright.

01:30:03.055 --> 01:30:04.596
[SPEAKER_07]: It had the stupid crying baby.

01:30:05.016 --> 01:30:05.776
[SPEAKER_07]: That was annoying.

01:30:06.416 --> 01:30:10.137
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, Super Mario World is the game.

01:30:10.257 --> 01:30:11.358
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

01:30:11.998 --> 01:30:14.159
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was subtitled as Super Mario Bros.

01:30:14.179 --> 01:30:15.559
[SPEAKER_07]: 4 for the Japanese release.

01:30:15.859 --> 01:30:16.739
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this music.

01:30:21.361 --> 01:30:22.561
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my favorite music in the game.

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:33.481
[SPEAKER_07]: This game had such great music.

01:30:33.501 --> 01:30:34.782
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was all done by Koji Kondo, too.

01:30:34.842 --> 01:30:35.303
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know that?

01:30:37.504 --> 01:30:43.428
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, of course, designed by Shigeru Miyamoto, who is the man.

01:30:44.488 --> 01:30:50.432
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's basically Mario and Luigi have to save Dinosaur Land from Bowser.

01:30:51.173 --> 01:30:56.056
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they go all the way across these seven worlds to save Dinosaur Land.

01:30:57.056 --> 01:31:16.766
[SPEAKER_07]: and it had different power-ups in it like the cape and of course you still had the fire flower and you could ride Yoshi and Yoshi was awesome so anyway it was pretty much you know you had your overworld and you could go into the different levels and you had your super mushroom which is the other one I forgot to mention

01:31:17.706 --> 01:31:35.471
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then Yoshi had all these different powers, like if you got different colored Yoshis, like the purple Yoshi, if you swallowed a shell, he could just keep flying forever, and then if you, if he was red, then every time he ate a shell, he would burp fire, and then there was the yellow Yoshi, wasn't it, that had the stomp, wasn't it the stomp?

01:31:36.701 --> 01:31:36.981
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

01:31:57.924 --> 01:31:59.745
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, Jamie, we need to pick a day.

01:32:00.366 --> 01:32:09.394
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to figure out a way to stream to the interwebs from your house on the TVs and all that and just fucking play this, Guardian Legend, all the fucking games we love as kids.

01:32:10.615 --> 01:32:13.357
[SPEAKER_11]: And somehow ask people to donate and make it a charity thing.

01:32:13.397 --> 01:32:16.239
[SPEAKER_07]: Halfway through this game, you will hear me cuss up a fucking storm.

01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:18.681
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of the dirt level.

01:32:18.942 --> 01:32:19.702
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, where it has the...

01:32:21.103 --> 01:32:32.872
[SPEAKER_07]: and the, I call it the dirt level, when it has the shifting sand and you'll either get crushed to death or get caught in a wall or something and get crushed to death again.

01:32:33.652 --> 01:32:43.239
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, so anyway, basically you also, you go to Dinosaur Land and you're on vacation and Peach gets kidnapped and

01:32:43.779 --> 01:32:44.600
[SPEAKER_07]: As usual.

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:48.142
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they find an egg and they meet Yoshi.

01:32:49.342 --> 01:32:52.604
[SPEAKER_07]: And they find out that evil turtles have imprisoned everybody.

01:32:54.525 --> 01:33:03.510
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, if you haven't played this game, get out from under the rock you've been hiding under and go freaking play it because it's awesome.

01:33:03.710 --> 01:33:04.571
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the end of it.

01:33:04.611 --> 01:33:08.433
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's Mode 7-tastic, the fight with Bowser.

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:11.860
[SPEAKER_07]: And man, there was just so much to do in this game.

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:12.940
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so much fun.

01:33:13.841 --> 01:33:15.142
[SPEAKER_07]: I really can't get over it.

01:33:15.162 --> 01:33:16.964
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were different ways to end each level.

01:33:17.584 --> 01:33:23.369
[SPEAKER_07]: You could get the key, and you would put the key in the keyhole, and the keyhole would get huge and then eat you.

01:33:24.710 --> 01:33:31.615
[SPEAKER_07]: And you could climb up the beanstalks like you could in the original Super Mario Bros.

01:33:31.695 --> 01:33:32.416
[SPEAKER_07]: and Mario Bros.

01:33:32.776 --> 01:33:32.416
3.

01:33:33.737 --> 01:33:37.700
[SPEAKER_07]: And you had the ghost houses that had the booze in them.

01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:39.021
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:34:05.916 --> 01:34:09.718
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know, the PlayStation was damn near the CD-ROM for the Super Nintendo.

01:34:09.798 --> 01:34:12.899
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:34:13.139 --> 01:34:18.301
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think that this game makes the best use of the music synthesizer in the system.

01:34:18.541 --> 01:34:19.442
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do think so.

01:34:22.263 --> 01:34:26.144
[SPEAKER_07]: You also have the P-blocks that would change your thing and change the type of ending that you get.

01:34:26.204 --> 01:34:26.885
[SPEAKER_07]: All kinds of stuff.

01:34:26.905 --> 01:34:27.445
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so much fun.

01:34:28.285 --> 01:34:29.086
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Star Road.

01:34:30.226 --> 01:34:32.908
[SPEAKER_07]: The Star Road was sparkly and freaking hard.

01:34:33.468 --> 01:34:35.289
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you had three different ways to beat the Star Road too.

01:34:35.309 --> 01:34:35.989
[SPEAKER_07]: It was crazy.

01:34:36.369 --> 01:34:37.550
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, so re-releases.

01:34:37.650 --> 01:34:41.672
[SPEAKER_07]: There was Super Mario All-Stars came out and it had this packaged with it.

01:34:42.092 --> 01:34:46.915
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is basically the exact same version as what came on the SNES anyway.

01:34:47.836 --> 01:34:53.884
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, however, a little bit of difference in it is that Luigi had his own sprite.

01:34:54.304 --> 01:34:55.105
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of neat.

01:34:55.866 --> 01:35:00.192
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Super Mario World came out, um, on the Virtual Console as well.

01:35:01.194 --> 01:35:01.774
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh...

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:06.206
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario Advance 2 Super Mario World

01:35:24.762 --> 01:35:38.267
[SPEAKER_11]: The interesting thing, too, about Mario World 2 is that even though it was so different and on paper it sounds terrible that they made all these changes, it really stands on its own as another great fucking 2D game.

01:35:38.508 --> 01:35:40.708
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same game, just with a little bit of tweaks.

01:35:40.748 --> 01:35:41.989
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an outstanding game.

01:35:42.309 --> 01:35:43.930
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:48.992
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also changed Luigi sprites to make it a little bit closer to the Mario Advance style.

01:35:50.472 --> 01:35:52.933
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, Koji Kondo did the music.

01:35:55.493 --> 01:35:58.634
[SPEAKER_07]: And he also did all the variations on it.

01:35:58.694 --> 01:36:04.236
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was like the waltz version of the music that played slower in the caves.

01:36:05.196 --> 01:36:06.616
[SPEAKER_07]: The underwater version.

01:36:06.856 --> 01:36:07.716
[SPEAKER_07]: All kinds of different ones.

01:36:07.836 --> 01:36:15.178
[SPEAKER_07]: And he basically... And when you ride on Yoshi, the soundtrack on the levels have bongo drums.

01:36:15.198 --> 01:36:16.158
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear that?

01:36:16.198 --> 01:36:18.259
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you can hear it in the background right now, actually.

01:36:23.829 --> 01:36:27.510
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I always thought that was awesome how the music changed, depending on if you were on Yoshi or not.

01:36:28.431 --> 01:36:30.612
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I read a quick comment from our chatroom?

01:36:30.752 --> 01:36:32.892
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a TigerClaw on chat talking about Mode 7.

01:36:33.273 --> 01:36:36.634
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember when you fight Bowser at the end, he does that thing where he flies towards the screen.

01:36:36.654 --> 01:36:39.435
[SPEAKER_11]: That was pretty cool back then, so we got an early taste of Mode 7.

01:36:39.855 --> 01:36:42.316
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, that last boss fight was epic.

01:36:43.136 --> 01:36:45.137
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but really easy.

01:36:45.617 --> 01:36:46.678
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really easy.

01:36:46.958 --> 01:36:52.920
[SPEAKER_07]: But you spend the whole game challenge to get there, but sort of the last boss fight is more of a relief.

01:36:53.857 --> 01:36:54.077
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:36:54.838 --> 01:36:56.319
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and it's not a short fight.

01:36:57.099 --> 01:36:57.860
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have to have good timing.

01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:58.580
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't multiple phases.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:02.122
[SPEAKER_11]: And the part where the little thing he's riding starts bouncing does get kind of hard.

01:37:02.162 --> 01:37:11.668
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, yeah, at that point, like, if you're good enough in the game to get to that point, then it's, um... Oh, I loved the, um, scary house music.

01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:12.269
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to turn it up.

01:37:18.559 --> 01:37:19.741
[SPEAKER_11]: And the fence?

01:37:19.821 --> 01:37:21.724
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, I love the fence stuff.

01:37:22.225 --> 01:37:24.468
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was in all of the commercials too, remember?

01:37:24.488 --> 01:37:25.870
[SPEAKER_07]: This game is so fucking good.

01:37:26.391 --> 01:37:28.694
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can punch through them in the face through the fence.

01:37:31.690 --> 01:37:32.771
[SPEAKER_07]: That was so awesome.

01:37:32.871 --> 01:37:34.152
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved punching them in the face.

01:37:34.172 --> 01:37:35.833
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh god, I totally forgot about the fence parts.

01:37:35.873 --> 01:37:37.554
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the flip around ones.

01:37:37.734 --> 01:37:40.376
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know, I know.

01:37:41.277 --> 01:37:47.821
[SPEAKER_07]: So, how about we get into some of the other little stuff that has to do with this.

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:49.763
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Asshole Mario?

01:37:49.783 --> 01:37:51.684
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember Asshole Mario?

01:37:51.784 --> 01:37:53.245
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember Asshole Mario.

01:37:53.285 --> 01:37:54.926
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a YouTube I can pull up of that real quick?

01:37:54.986 --> 01:37:55.727
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there is.

01:37:55.887 --> 01:37:57.008
[SPEAKER_11]: It won't matter because they won't see.

01:37:57.028 --> 01:37:58.569
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll have to Tumblr it or something.

01:37:58.729 --> 01:38:01.851
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, look up one of the music Mario World.

01:38:03.012 --> 01:38:06.535
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, um... Or you can just keep playing, I don't care.

01:38:06.875 --> 01:38:07.555
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the Thwomps.

01:38:07.836 --> 01:38:08.416
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are awesome.

01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:09.637
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay.

01:38:10.297 --> 01:38:16.822
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Asshole Mario is basically, um, ROM hacks of Super Mario World.

01:38:17.342 --> 01:38:22.006
[SPEAKER_07]: Where it's not impossible, but it's freaking terrible.

01:38:22.526 --> 01:38:52.266
[SPEAKER_07]: because you have to have perfect timing and be able to cut out so short but you really have to be careful and have your timing perfect and you keep dying over and over and over again you just have to have a million men to get through it but yeah if you want to see an exercise in futility look up Asshole Mario and then there's another one where people would basically have I think it's like an autoplay is what it was called the Mario autoplays

01:38:53.366 --> 01:39:00.470
[SPEAKER_07]: where they actually have where all you do is you start the level and Mario will start walking on his own.

01:39:00.970 --> 01:39:03.191
[SPEAKER_07]: You basically do it through means of an auto-scroll level.

01:39:03.911 --> 01:39:05.152
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that shit was funny.

01:39:05.272 --> 01:39:08.433
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, look up autoplay, I think is what it is.

01:39:09.033 --> 01:39:17.137
[SPEAKER_07]: It would play rhythm along with whatever the music was in the background level.

01:39:17.177 --> 01:39:18.097
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is one, isn't it?

01:39:19.978 --> 01:39:21.879
[SPEAKER_11]: This YouTube's called Super Mario Auto-Run.

01:39:23.695 --> 01:39:26.078
[SPEAKER_11]: It has some weird music in the background.

01:39:26.219 --> 01:39:27.600
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's doing it to different music.

01:39:27.621 --> 01:39:31.866
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you turn that up just a little bit?

01:39:31.946 --> 01:39:32.367
Okay.

01:39:47.628 --> 01:39:49.889
[SPEAKER_11]: Put that on the Tumblr so people can see that.

01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:51.590
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's the first one I ever saw.

01:39:52.251 --> 01:39:59.635
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, that's what we're using Tumblr for now is that all these little things we see during the show, that way you podcast-y listeners can go back and have it all in one place.

01:40:00.276 --> 01:40:13.781
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but basically they'll take music and they'll set the game autoplaying to all of this stuff and just the amount of time and thought and rhythm that goes into this is just absolutely baffling.

01:40:13.821 --> 01:40:15.702
[SPEAKER_07]: These people have no lives, but it's really cool.

01:40:16.002 --> 01:40:18.583
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100, Matt, link to Asshole Mario in the chat room.

01:40:18.743 --> 01:40:19.623
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool, I'll link that too.

01:40:19.643 --> 01:40:21.484
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to remember how fucking terrible this is.

01:40:22.704 --> 01:40:23.425
[SPEAKER_07]: Asshole Mario.

01:40:24.805 --> 01:40:29.527
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you just start to feel sorry for these people after a while because it's like

01:40:33.650 --> 01:40:37.411
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear, there's been times when I've watched those and I just want to go, oh, I'm so sorry.

01:40:37.551 --> 01:40:38.291
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:40:38.391 --> 01:40:42.072
[SPEAKER_07]: And then feel like crying because you can feel like it's happening to you.

01:40:42.292 --> 01:40:45.553
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm laughing because this stage just starts out right off the bat.

01:40:45.613 --> 01:40:46.633
[SPEAKER_11]: Bullet Bill in your face.

01:40:49.113 --> 01:40:51.114
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're not ready for it, it's going to get you.

01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:53.691
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

01:40:54.351 --> 01:40:55.692
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else that you were going to say about this?

01:40:55.852 --> 01:41:00.514
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's just that Super Mario World is awesome, and it's clearly created such a legacy, you know?

01:41:00.795 --> 01:41:01.155
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

01:41:01.795 --> 01:41:06.618
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'd say it's well worthy of being our classic game of the week.

01:41:06.918 --> 01:41:11.481
[SPEAKER_11]: If Mario 3D World is half as good as Super Mario World, it'll be a great purchase.

01:41:11.961 --> 01:41:12.441
[SPEAKER_11]: For real.

01:41:13.322 --> 01:41:13.502
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

01:41:14.303 --> 01:41:16.607
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, your classic game of the week, Super Mario World.

01:41:16.687 --> 01:41:18.651
[SPEAKER_11]: A true, true, true classic.

01:41:18.831 --> 01:41:20.154
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, like, the classic.

01:41:20.695 --> 01:41:24.021
[SPEAKER_11]: And just shocked as hell that that has never come up before.

01:41:24.362 --> 01:41:25.144
[SPEAKER_11]: So, what a find.

01:41:25.615 --> 01:41:29.877
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.

01:41:30.057 --> 01:41:30.777
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not done yet.

01:41:30.817 --> 01:41:31.938
[SPEAKER_11]: There's still half a show to come.

01:41:32.178 --> 01:41:33.799
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got plenty of news to talk about still.

01:41:34.059 --> 01:41:38.501
[SPEAKER_11]: Your emails are coming up, the FUs of the week, your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

01:41:39.241 --> 01:41:46.364
[SPEAKER_11]: Much more news in the second half of the show, including, I find this crazy, which PopCap game might they be making an arcade machine out of?

01:41:46.905 --> 01:41:48.245
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be something else, huh?

01:41:48.925 --> 01:41:54.308
[SPEAKER_11]: Rapid fire news and all that fun stuff when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:42:00.256 --> 01:42:02.737
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:42:02.777 --> 01:42:15.321
[SPEAKER_11]: We are live on this Sunday evening, November the 6th of 2011 with the second half of episode number 434 live tonight as we are every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

01:42:15.801 --> 01:42:19.983
[SPEAKER_11]: We are on at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

01:42:20.243 --> 01:42:20.903
[SPEAKER_11]: We love Bobby.

01:42:21.003 --> 01:42:27.405
[SPEAKER_11]: He's one guy doing an NPR-ish style show where he talks about games and has live call-ins as well and so forth.

01:42:27.665 --> 01:42:29.466
[SPEAKER_11]: And one thing he was talking about... Except without being boring.

01:42:30.166 --> 01:42:30.987
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not boring.

01:42:31.027 --> 01:42:31.767
[SPEAKER_11]: Not at all.

01:42:31.987 --> 01:42:36.430
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like one of those really thrilling NPR shows like Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me or something like that.

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:36.930
[SPEAKER_11]: Those exist?

01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.631
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:42:37.911 --> 01:42:39.072
[SPEAKER_11]: They have some fun podcasts.

01:42:39.092 --> 01:42:39.852
[SPEAKER_11]: You should check it out.

01:42:40.252 --> 01:42:46.696
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, one thing that Bobby was talking about on his show tonight that I guess it's coming up a little later in our show so I apologize.

01:42:46.736 --> 01:42:59.764
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm stepping on it a little bit but maybe Loki can find another story to fill in for it because I want to talk about this and that's the Mass Effect 3 beta that came out and I guess some things are being reported out of that whole Mass Effect 3 beta that there's going to be new modes

01:42:59.964 --> 01:43:00.404
[SPEAKER_02]: in the game.

01:43:00.905 --> 01:43:04.126
[SPEAKER_11]: That there's not just going to be like a normal mode, right?

01:43:04.386 --> 01:43:12.351
[SPEAKER_11]: But that there'll be a mode in the game that focuses more on the combat features and then a mode that focuses more on the RPG and dialogue features.

01:43:12.791 --> 01:43:17.434
[SPEAKER_11]: And I gotta admit, I'm not usually a Mass Effect fan, but I find that shit really exciting.

01:43:17.934 --> 01:43:24.317
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, I... Combat's okay, but I'm way more into the story elements and all of that.

01:43:24.357 --> 01:43:28.660
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there's like an RPG only mode, like, I'm really excited about that.

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:29.180
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki would...

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:31.424
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that's good for the game?

01:43:31.744 --> 01:43:32.766
[SPEAKER_11]: For the series or what?

01:43:33.848 --> 01:43:34.149
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

01:43:34.509 --> 01:43:35.631
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably won't pick it up anyways.

01:43:36.209 --> 01:43:37.870
[SPEAKER_11]: You get it anyways, just because?

01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:38.850
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I will not get it.

01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:39.630
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you're not going to get it?

01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:39.990
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:41.151
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just not a fan of Mass Effect?

01:43:41.211 --> 01:43:42.531
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm not a fan of Mass Effect.

01:43:43.091 --> 01:43:44.992
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not either, but I find that really interesting.

01:43:45.272 --> 01:43:49.333
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, and to be honest, I'm not hating because I think the games are bad.

01:43:49.393 --> 01:43:57.156
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, again, there's only so many games that a person can play at a time, and I just never got into Mass Effect 1 or 2 as much as other people loved them.

01:43:57.456 --> 01:44:02.078
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched somebody play 1, and I was kind of like, it doesn't really look like something I'd be into.

01:44:03.819 --> 01:44:18.975
[SPEAKER_11]: I've enjoyed other Bioware games I've played like Dragon Age, so who knows Alright, well let's get into some rapid fire news We're going to cover some news stories really quickly Because there was quite a bit of news this week It is a busy time of year Loki, we'll start with you

01:44:20.033 --> 01:44:23.694
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom believes that Resident Evil Revelations is going to be worth $50.

01:44:24.354 --> 01:44:27.874
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's $10 more than your regular 3DS game.

01:44:27.914 --> 01:44:34.275
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, even Nintendo games like Super Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart 7 are only going to be $40.

01:44:35.056 --> 01:44:36.516
[SPEAKER_09]: But Capcom thinks, hey, you know what?

01:44:36.916 --> 01:44:41.017
[SPEAKER_09]: Resident Evil Revelations should be $50.

01:44:43.897 --> 01:44:48.578
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will support the Circle Pad, which will be coming out here later on for another $20.

01:44:49.944 --> 01:44:56.989
[SPEAKER_09]: and, you know, and they did, they were quick to point out, yes, you can reset your save game this time.

01:44:57.970 --> 01:44:59.271
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, thank you, Capcom.

01:44:59.331 --> 01:44:59.911
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

01:44:59.931 --> 01:45:01.512
[SPEAKER_11]: That was very gracious of you to let us do that.

01:45:01.973 --> 01:45:04.174
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's the reasoning why they need the extra $10.

01:45:04.594 --> 01:45:09.998
[SPEAKER_09]: A true console experience on a handheld device is what Resident Evil Revelations is.

01:45:10.539 --> 01:45:16.623
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also going to be, it requires a 4 gigabyte cartridge resulting in a higher price point.

01:45:17.768 --> 01:45:21.710
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, because those extra gigabytes are more expensive.

01:45:22.150 --> 01:45:35.195
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't know what cartridges cost, but I know when it comes to flash memory, an extra four gigs on flash memory, four versus eight, like a few bucks, a couple dollars.

01:45:36.815 --> 01:45:38.616
[SPEAKER_09]: Flash memory is really cheap, Capcom.

01:45:39.016 --> 01:45:39.716
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not buying it.

01:45:40.937 --> 01:45:41.977
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, I'm not buying it.

01:45:42.157 --> 01:45:43.978
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to buy your game at all.

01:45:46.488 --> 01:45:48.349
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

01:45:48.689 --> 01:45:50.530
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, if you're interested, it comes out in February.

01:45:51.671 --> 01:45:57.174
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, there's going to be a new Rainbow Six game coming from Ubisoft, I'm sure.

01:45:57.734 --> 01:46:07.960
[SPEAKER_09]: While it's probably a ways away, but Rainbow Six Patriots, outed by the new Game Informer cover, is going to be kind of a game that deals with, you know...

01:46:10.062 --> 01:46:16.552
[SPEAKER_09]: Terrorism set in our own country and kind of like homegrown terrorists, I guess.

01:46:19.477 --> 01:46:23.244
[SPEAKER_09]: No real details, but obviously they're saying there's a lot of, you know...

01:46:25.499 --> 01:46:32.523
[SPEAKER_09]: Splits in a lot of... The word's escaping me now.

01:46:33.764 --> 01:46:37.246
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, a lot of different narrative directions, they said.

01:46:38.287 --> 01:46:40.108
[SPEAKER_09]: Tactics and realism.

01:46:40.148 --> 01:46:43.110
[SPEAKER_09]: They kind of go in the whole double... What was it?

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:46.972
[SPEAKER_09]: The last conviction route, I guess, the Splinter Cell game.

01:46:47.412 --> 01:46:49.234
[SPEAKER_09]: More realistic and gritty versus...

01:46:50.174 --> 01:46:50.755
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

01:47:09.568 --> 01:47:13.654
[SPEAKER_09]: I did play a lot of Ghost Recon stuff so it should be interesting to have to check it out I guess.

01:47:26.505 --> 01:47:30.471
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Dan played a little bit of that and he liked it, of Rainbow Six, the last one.

01:47:31.732 --> 01:47:43.469
[SPEAKER_09]: And not surprisingly, with all the Kinect hacks out there, Microsoft is actually thinking about marketing Kinect for PC and Kinect for Windows is going to be the new marketing campaign, I guess.

01:47:43.949 --> 01:47:47.032
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

01:48:06.753 --> 01:48:08.055
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

01:48:24.214 --> 01:48:35.420
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that, but maybe they could adapt the Kinect camera to have it like, okay, there's going to be one that's like, I'm sitting in front of my laptop versus I'm sitting eight feet away from my laptop.

01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:36.001
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, true.

01:48:36.561 --> 01:48:49.609
[SPEAKER_11]: And for some of the accessibility reasons that Salacious Pop had brought up in a chat comment earlier, I could see where Kinect getting built into the PCs would be more useful than what we think of in our minds right now when we think of Kinect like Dance Central.

01:48:50.444 --> 01:48:50.664
[SPEAKER_10]: you know.

01:48:50.884 --> 01:48:51.104
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:48:52.685 --> 01:48:52.885
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

01:48:53.605 --> 01:48:53.986
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be neat.

01:48:54.666 --> 01:48:56.307
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially some of the voice commands and things like that.

01:48:56.647 --> 01:49:04.850
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially with some of the early stuff of Windows 8 where you see that it's going to have a mode that's very dashboard like or tablet like.

01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:06.151
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure you've all seen that.

01:49:06.491 --> 01:49:06.951
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:49:07.131 --> 01:49:07.911
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be interesting.

01:49:09.112 --> 01:49:10.453
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Kinect could control that.

01:49:10.833 --> 01:49:17.776
[SPEAKER_09]: Well I can see yeah definitely because the Kinect controls that already in the new dashboard so they could just adapt it exactly the same way.

01:49:18.136 --> 01:49:18.336
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

01:49:18.356 --> 01:49:18.436
[SPEAKER_11]: True.

01:49:20.370 --> 01:49:20.951
[SPEAKER_11]: Techland Dead World

01:49:37.411 --> 01:49:40.094
[SPEAKER_11]: Did pretty well, came out at a good time, and a lot of people were into this.

01:49:40.154 --> 01:49:44.179
[SPEAKER_11]: So going from island to the whole damn world makes a lot of sense.

01:49:44.399 --> 01:49:48.244
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see more on that probably at E3 next year if it ends up that it's legit.

01:49:48.624 --> 01:49:50.767
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe they're just trademarking it just in case.

01:49:51.027 --> 01:49:53.670
[SPEAKER_11]: You never know, but usually these things end up being in the game.

01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:56.814
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I might imagine that they're making a sequel to a popular game.

01:49:57.134 --> 01:50:03.178
[SPEAKER_11]: Walmart's getting its own game magazine, which game magazines do pretty well for stores if GameStop is any indication.

01:50:03.558 --> 01:50:10.583
[SPEAKER_11]: But what's interesting is that the folks behind it is going to be EGM Media, of course, Electronic Gaming Monthly.

01:50:10.923 --> 01:50:13.565
[SPEAKER_11]: The new magazine will be called Walmart Game Center.

01:50:13.605 --> 01:50:15.146
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not saying it's going to be monthly.

01:50:15.206 --> 01:50:17.388
[SPEAKER_11]: They just say, quote, regular frequency.

01:50:17.948 --> 01:50:24.753
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe that's just monthly during the busy periods and twice every other month or whatever during the not-so-busy periods.

01:50:24.773 --> 01:50:25.073
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

01:50:26.474 --> 01:50:32.477
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to have news, previews, interviews, and other exclusive stories on gaming culture and the most important game releases.

01:50:32.517 --> 01:50:35.318
[SPEAKER_11]: In other words, pretty much the same shit you can get on the internet right away.

01:50:35.819 --> 01:50:37.880
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's making it very difficult for magazines right now.

01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:47.565
[SPEAKER_11]: But if they can get the good exclusives and takes on gaming culture, certainly it could give GameStop some competition.

01:50:47.605 --> 01:50:52.248
[SPEAKER_11]: And although I'm not a big Walmart fan either, I'm all for giving GameStop a little competition, eh?

01:50:53.328 --> 01:51:00.754
[SPEAKER_11]: They are going to offer this on personal computers, iPad, and Facebook with what's called the Screen Paper Publishing Platform.

01:51:00.794 --> 01:51:02.675
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's a proprietary thing to EGM.

01:51:03.075 --> 01:51:10.041
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting to me that it's not on the iPod or iOS, iPad magazine thing they have now.

01:51:10.061 --> 01:51:12.082
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you can get Retro Gamer now on your iPhone.

01:51:12.102 --> 01:51:12.543
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you know that?

01:51:12.583 --> 01:51:14.924
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all part of that newsstand thing that came out in the new iOS.

01:51:15.565 --> 01:51:20.889
[SPEAKER_11]: Granted, you have to pay five bucks an issue or whatever it costs normally on the newsstand, but it is, you know,

01:51:21.564 --> 01:51:22.045
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

01:51:38.443 --> 01:51:39.584
[SPEAKER_11]: I can totally tell you that.

01:51:39.864 --> 01:51:41.346
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I think this is funny.

01:51:41.406 --> 01:51:44.148
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a very tongue-in-cheek, very sordid game.

01:51:44.188 --> 01:51:53.155
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an indie game that just came out on Xbox Live Indie Games, and the indie game developer is Ben Kane.

01:51:54.296 --> 01:51:58.880
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called DLC Quest, and I love this trailer, so I'm going to play a little bit for you guys.

01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:00.301
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we'll get it on the Tumblr, too.

01:52:01.302 --> 01:52:04.704
[SPEAKER_11]: Going Loud Studios put this out, and here's the trailer.

01:52:04.844 --> 01:52:06.626
[SPEAKER_01]: DLC goes to

01:52:10.575 --> 01:52:17.057
[SPEAKER_01]: DLC Quest Basic features are now DLC Pausing the game?

01:52:17.677 --> 01:52:20.617
[SPEAKER_01]: DLC Quest Animation?

01:52:21.358 --> 01:52:24.818
[SPEAKER_01]: DLC Quest Moving to the left?

01:52:25.699 --> 01:52:28.919
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's included No, it's not!

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:30.820
[SPEAKER_01]: DLC Quest

01:52:31.701 --> 01:52:33.782
[SPEAKER_01]: Collect coins, then buy DLC.

01:52:34.382 --> 01:52:34.982
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simple.

01:52:35.963 --> 01:52:39.685
[SPEAKER_01]: DLC means Downloadable Content, and Quest means Quest.

01:52:40.285 --> 01:52:41.705
[SPEAKER_01]: DLC Quest.

01:52:42.346 --> 01:52:50.229
[SPEAKER_01]: We got map packs, night map packs, sexy outfits, hats, and zombies.

01:52:50.949 --> 01:52:52.910
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we even got horse armor.

01:52:53.511 --> 01:52:54.911
[SPEAKER_01]: DLC Quest.

01:52:55.852 --> 01:52:58.273
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think there's a princess or something to rescue too.

01:52:59.393 --> 01:52:59.954
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

01:53:00.614 --> 01:53:00.955
F*** you.

01:53:01.675 --> 01:53:03.997
[SPEAKER_01]: DLC Quest is made with satire.

01:53:04.537 --> 01:53:09.441
[SPEAKER_01]: Satire means the use of humor, irony, and saturation or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity.

01:53:10.042 --> 01:53:11.423
[SPEAKER_01]: DLC Quest.

01:53:12.124 --> 01:53:13.745
[SPEAKER_01]: Download it now!

01:53:15.939 --> 01:53:16.900
[SPEAKER_11]: See, now I thought that was funny.

01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:18.781
[SPEAKER_11]: It was funny.

01:53:18.901 --> 01:53:19.382
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

01:53:20.062 --> 01:53:27.068
[SPEAKER_11]: The satire part is, and what you can't see unless you're actually looking at the video, is that the guy is walking around collecting coins in a very Mario-esque kind of game.

01:53:27.448 --> 01:53:36.095
[SPEAKER_11]: So the quote-unquote DLC is that you're using these coins you pick up to get the ability to move to the left and get sexy princess outfits and horse armor and all this stuff.

01:53:36.555 --> 01:53:38.997
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's funny, and it is pretty good satire.

01:53:39.017 --> 01:53:39.837
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you think of that, Loki?

01:53:39.857 --> 01:53:41.158
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I've seen that before.

01:53:41.419 --> 01:53:41.659
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

01:53:41.979 --> 01:53:42.479
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty funny.

01:53:42.499 --> 01:53:43.180
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's pretty funny.

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:44.621
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know how much that costs.

01:53:44.661 --> 01:53:45.562
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't see... Oh!

01:53:46.302 --> 01:53:47.283
[SPEAKER_11]: 80 Microsoft points.

01:53:47.703 --> 01:53:48.104
[SPEAKER_11]: A buck.

01:53:48.684 --> 01:53:49.505
[SPEAKER_11]: Good for you, dude.

01:53:50.025 --> 01:53:50.646
[SPEAKER_11]: A whole dollar.

01:53:51.106 --> 01:53:52.467
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you'll sell some copies with that.

01:53:53.288 --> 01:53:53.728
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

01:53:54.128 --> 01:53:54.529
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.830
[SPEAKER_11]: Good for you, dude.

01:53:56.951 --> 01:53:58.352
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:53:59.226 --> 01:54:27.949
[SPEAKER_07]: a couple things actually new Xbox Live Arcade game is Alan Wake it's going to be available for Xbox Live Arcade and it was announced on their Facebook page and it's not a sequel it is the game also there is a country music pack for Rock Band 3 that's got a lot of crap in it and I mean crap because I hate country music it's called Going Country Pack 5 it's Shelly Wright's

01:54:28.049 --> 01:54:30.873
[SPEAKER_11]: But couldn't you call stuff like Sweet Home Alabama country music?

01:54:30.993 --> 01:54:31.934
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Southern Rock.

01:54:32.014 --> 01:54:32.555
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a difference.

01:54:32.995 --> 01:54:33.596
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.

01:54:33.716 --> 01:54:34.117
[SPEAKER_11]: My bad.

01:54:35.539 --> 01:54:36.920
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some decent stuff in here.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.002
[SPEAKER_07]: Like The Night the Lights Went On in Georgia.

01:54:39.062 --> 01:54:39.603
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Reba.

01:54:39.623 --> 01:54:40.443
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't, you know.

01:54:41.304 --> 01:54:42.205
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Sugarland.

01:54:42.845 --> 01:54:44.767
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also Going Country Pack 6.

01:54:44.947 --> 01:54:47.949
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Billy Currington, whoever the crap that is.

01:54:48.410 --> 01:54:49.110
[SPEAKER_07]: George Strait.

01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.751
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, hey.

01:54:50.111 --> 01:54:51.292
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny Cash, Ring of Fire.

01:54:52.173 --> 01:54:53.454
[SPEAKER_07]: Justin Moore, who cares.

01:54:54.154 --> 01:54:55.415
[SPEAKER_07]: Going Country Pack 7.

01:54:55.556 --> 01:54:56.476
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, Johnny Cash.

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:57.177
[SPEAKER_07]: Keith Urban.

01:54:57.377 --> 01:54:57.597
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

01:54:57.998 --> 01:54:58.778
[SPEAKER_07]: Lady Antebellum.

01:54:59.679 --> 01:55:00.379
[SPEAKER_07]: Merle Haggard.

01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:02.041
[SPEAKER_07]: Now Merle Haggard's pretty awesome.

01:55:02.421 --> 01:55:05.406
[SPEAKER_07]: and Going Country Pack 8 has Dwight Yoakam and Rascal Flatts.

01:55:06.187 --> 01:55:10.955
[SPEAKER_07]: Going Country Mega Pack, all of the above and all the other stuff I didn't say and it's 20 bucks.

01:55:11.727 --> 01:55:18.912
[SPEAKER_11]: It almost makes you think that at some point they were going to do a country rock band release and didn't end up doing it because they had like all these songs.

01:55:18.932 --> 01:55:19.512
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a lot.

01:55:19.532 --> 01:55:21.794
[SPEAKER_11]: They did two country rock band track packs.

01:55:21.854 --> 01:55:23.635
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they did the track packs a while ago.

01:55:23.695 --> 01:55:26.037
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess maybe this is just a virtual version of that.

01:55:26.097 --> 01:55:26.457
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:55:26.517 --> 01:55:30.059
[SPEAKER_07]: The only one of those I care about is Johnny Cash because Ring of Fire is awesome.

01:55:30.079 --> 01:55:33.101
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Johnny Cash is above country music.

01:55:33.421 --> 01:55:34.522
[SPEAKER_11]: He's godly music.

01:55:36.463 --> 01:55:38.645
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Ring of Fire was in the Silent Hill movie.

01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:40.021
[SPEAKER_11]: SILENT HILL

01:55:57.538 --> 01:56:03.083
[SPEAKER_07]: There actually is talk that Silent Hill may be going off into different spin-offs.

01:56:05.405 --> 01:56:13.992
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really said exactly what, but there's been mentions of maybe an RPG or a first-person shooter.

01:56:14.770 --> 01:56:15.951
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:56:41.364 --> 01:56:43.407
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, Downpour was never going to be an FPS.

01:56:43.507 --> 01:56:47.751
[SPEAKER_07]: This was just the result of some overzealous fans reading too much into a posting on Vatcher's website.

01:56:49.173 --> 01:56:50.815
[SPEAKER_07]: How about make Silent Hill cool again?

01:56:51.616 --> 01:56:52.136
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

01:56:52.256 --> 01:56:52.696
[SPEAKER_11]: Bastards.

01:56:52.756 --> 01:56:54.077
[SPEAKER_11]: Force Akira Yamaoka to come back.

01:56:54.197 --> 01:56:56.278
[SPEAKER_11]: Throw a lot, a lot, a lot of money at him.

01:56:57.018 --> 01:56:57.678
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what you could do.

01:56:58.339 --> 01:56:59.039
[SPEAKER_07]: And grovel.

01:56:59.179 --> 01:56:59.739
[SPEAKER_07]: Groveling helps.

01:57:00.259 --> 01:57:04.101
[SPEAKER_11]: Some comments from our chat room at chat.orangecountry.com.

01:57:04.121 --> 01:57:06.342
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot on the country pack of the DarkSakura I mentioned a minute ago.

01:57:06.922 --> 01:57:10.203
[SPEAKER_11]: Brad from PodCulture says, when is this country pack due out or did I miss it?

01:57:11.324 --> 01:57:12.124
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you say the date?

01:57:13.124 --> 01:57:13.765
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I didn't.

01:57:14.005 --> 01:57:15.965
[SPEAKER_11]: It's this upcoming week, right?

01:57:15.985 --> 01:57:16.586
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think so.

01:57:17.626 --> 01:57:19.787
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that'll be out very, very soon.

01:57:19.827 --> 01:57:21.408
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like something like Way in the Future.

01:57:21.548 --> 01:57:22.689
[SPEAKER_11]: It is, I just pulled it up.

01:57:22.769 --> 01:57:25.650
[SPEAKER_11]: November 8th is when this is all out.

01:57:25.730 --> 01:57:26.450
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to other comments.

01:57:26.890 --> 01:57:29.752
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend of Zaku says, needs more achy, breaky heart.

01:57:30.852 --> 01:57:31.313
[SPEAKER_11]: Please no.

01:57:31.673 --> 01:57:32.713
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless we have the Weird Al version.

01:57:32.753 --> 01:57:33.734
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a Weird Al pack.

01:57:34.274 --> 01:57:35.274
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be awesome, actually.

01:57:36.315 --> 01:57:38.756
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to be in Oakland in a couple days, or maybe it was tonight.

01:57:39.436 --> 01:57:40.017
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn.

01:57:41.017 --> 01:57:42.638
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's no writing going on or anything like that.

01:57:43.348 --> 01:57:43.748
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

01:57:44.889 --> 01:57:49.775
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiger Claw says, going country, will there be other genres like going dance, going rave?

01:57:51.077 --> 01:57:55.843
[SPEAKER_11]: As neat as that idea is, keep in mind it is going to have to make use of all the instruments somehow.

01:57:56.243 --> 01:57:57.785
[SPEAKER_11]: Now there are some...

01:57:58.846 --> 01:58:27.770
[SPEAKER_11]: songs that you know will exclude a keyboard or a bass but keep in mind it's going to be really hard to do a dance pack unless it has guitars but like they could do like cnc music factory everybody dance now because i had that i guess they could probably get creative and figure something out we'll see all right uh let's move on to some more news before we get to the mailbag and the f us of the week and your calls pretty soon here loki

01:58:28.792 --> 01:58:28.972
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:58:29.612 --> 01:58:44.455
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, one of the features of the PlayStation 3 has been to allow people the ability to share content, or at least you can link your content that you download to up to five different PS3s.

01:58:44.956 --> 01:58:51.117
[SPEAKER_09]: I would imagine that's if, for example, you own multiple PS3s, or, for example, if you have a PS3 that...

01:58:52.798 --> 01:58:58.762
[SPEAKER_09]: and you want to bring that content to the new PS3 and they figure that you're not probably going to go through five PS3s.

01:58:59.142 --> 01:59:01.423
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, people have been using that to share games.

01:59:01.544 --> 01:59:11.150
[SPEAKER_09]: So say, for example, I download a game and I can share it with four of my friends because they all download it to their console using that sharing feature kind of...

01:59:12.751 --> 01:59:14.232
[SPEAKER_09]: Exploiting, if you will.

01:59:14.832 --> 01:59:22.315
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, beginning on November 18th, PlayStation Network licenses can only be tied to two PS3s and two PSPs.

01:59:23.395 --> 01:59:28.297
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently they're saying that that's going to affect purchases made after the start date.

01:59:28.978 --> 01:59:38.282
[SPEAKER_09]: And while you'll be able to deactivate and reactivate consoles online, the days of sharing with a bunch of people is now gone.

01:59:38.722 --> 01:59:39.142
[SPEAKER_09]: And so...

01:59:40.931 --> 01:59:42.333
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I think that's fair.

01:59:42.413 --> 01:59:55.669
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because people were kind of abusing it to begin with to get free games, and if you can deactivate consoles, like, say, for example, your console dies or whatever, and you can reactivate it on a new console, I think that's fair enough.

01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:57.732
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

01:59:58.753 --> 01:59:59.373
[SPEAKER_09]: Go Sony.

01:59:59.613 --> 02:00:02.335
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of not surprised they're clamping down on it.

02:00:02.415 --> 02:00:10.502
[SPEAKER_11]: Five did seem excessive and they're probably privy to all these people that have formed these little clubs about sharing the codes and so forth or sharing the content.

02:00:10.562 --> 02:00:11.702
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not too surprised.

02:00:12.263 --> 02:00:14.104
[SPEAKER_11]: Two seems reasonable.

02:00:14.404 --> 02:00:17.307
[SPEAKER_11]: One downstairs, one upstairs or one in the bedroom, one in the living room.

02:00:17.327 --> 02:00:19.008
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and the fact that you can deactivate them too.

02:00:19.048 --> 02:00:21.350
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you could deactivate the ones when it's five.

02:00:22.130 --> 02:00:22.670
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good point.

02:00:23.431 --> 02:00:25.852
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be, I think that's fair.

02:00:25.872 --> 02:00:29.013
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be good if you fry one PS3 and you have to get another one.

02:00:29.053 --> 02:00:32.395
[SPEAKER_09]: You can add it onto that and deactivate it once you get the new one.

02:00:32.935 --> 02:00:33.335
[SPEAKER_11]: Very true.

02:00:34.176 --> 02:00:38.137
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's good and not too surprising that they've clamped down on that.

02:00:38.157 --> 02:00:40.038
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, that's not retroactive, right?

02:00:40.078 --> 02:00:43.400
[SPEAKER_11]: So any old games you've already bought are under the 5 license.

02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:45.741
[SPEAKER_11]: So the clubs aren't really getting shut down.

02:00:46.301 --> 02:00:48.742
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, you know, you're not going to be able to do it much longer.

02:00:49.102 --> 02:00:49.322
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:00:50.002 --> 02:00:56.165
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's one of the games that you won't be sharing with five different people, which is too bad because it's going to be a pretty big party game.

02:00:56.665 --> 02:01:00.826
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if you've ever played this card game at a party, you know how much fun it can be.

02:01:01.186 --> 02:01:02.127
[SPEAKER_11]: Apples to Apples.

02:01:02.167 --> 02:01:02.947
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever played this?

02:01:03.307 --> 02:01:03.707
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.

02:01:03.907 --> 02:01:04.167
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

02:01:04.288 --> 02:01:10.050
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the game where you have a card on a green card, and the green card is some type of, like, verb.

02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:14.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't know, like... It's usually an adjective, I think.

02:01:14.271 --> 02:01:15.432
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like an adjective.

02:01:15.752 --> 02:01:15.952
[SPEAKER_11]: Like...

02:01:16.832 --> 02:01:17.232
[SPEAKER_09]: Tasty.

02:01:17.472 --> 02:01:18.172
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Tasty.

02:01:18.473 --> 02:01:27.896
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the red cards all have nouns on them, like the 90s, or the card that will always win every round, including Tasty, you put down Helen Keller.

02:01:28.436 --> 02:01:29.896
[SPEAKER_11]: Always wins the round, right?

02:01:30.197 --> 02:01:33.258
[SPEAKER_11]: And then because everybody votes on which card is the funniest for that.

02:01:33.578 --> 02:01:40.200
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this game is going to be coming out for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this holiday season.

02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:41.981
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to play the shit out of this.

02:01:42.002 --> 02:01:47.027
[SPEAKER_11]: THQ is doing it and apparently they're going to be adding this social and online connectivity.

02:01:47.687 --> 02:01:50.550
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to be able to play this anywhere, anytime.

02:01:51.892 --> 02:01:58.078
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be interesting to see how it works because it's not going to be the same online that it is in person.

02:01:58.558 --> 02:02:03.003
[SPEAKER_07]: Or that it is drunk on pineapple Malibu in the hotel room.

02:02:03.396 --> 02:02:06.538
[SPEAKER_11]: There will be single, local, and six-player online play.

02:02:06.898 --> 02:02:08.559
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to have golden Apple cards.

02:02:08.579 --> 02:02:09.900
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you play single player?

02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:11.521
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of dumb, huh?

02:02:11.941 --> 02:02:15.263
[SPEAKER_11]: Golden Apple cards, which will be used to change the rules.

02:02:15.663 --> 02:02:17.885
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be Facebook support as well.

02:02:18.405 --> 02:02:19.986
[SPEAKER_11]: Download content, of course.

02:02:20.306 --> 02:02:23.368
[SPEAKER_11]: More cards and all the same stuff you saw in Uno.

02:02:23.608 --> 02:02:26.190
[SPEAKER_11]: 800 Microsoft points, $9.99 on PlayStation 3.

02:02:26.910 --> 02:02:29.712
[SPEAKER_11]: And the game will be expanding to Facebook and so forth later on.

02:02:31.231 --> 02:02:38.100
[SPEAKER_11]: God, I love the party game, but online, if I'm not playing with friends, I don't know how this is going to be much fun.

02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:39.782
[SPEAKER_11]: With strangers, it's going to be stupid.

02:02:40.643 --> 02:02:41.124
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

02:02:41.765 --> 02:02:42.786
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what would be awesome?

02:02:43.227 --> 02:02:43.387
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

02:02:44.614 --> 02:02:45.414
[SPEAKER_11]: What was it?

02:02:46.415 --> 02:02:47.515
[SPEAKER_09]: Eat Poop, You Cat?

02:02:48.795 --> 02:02:51.156
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, God, explain that game real quick.

02:02:51.556 --> 02:02:52.116
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a fun game.

02:02:52.296 --> 02:02:58.378
[SPEAKER_09]: Eat Poop, You Cat is basically a visual telephone, I guess.

02:02:58.518 --> 02:03:02.540
[SPEAKER_09]: You start off by writing a phrase, and you pass it to the next person.

02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:09.882
[SPEAKER_09]: They draw a picture of that phrase, and then you basically obscure the original phrase, and the next person tries, they write a phrase...

02:03:10.322 --> 02:03:11.363
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

02:03:33.158 --> 02:03:56.635
[SPEAKER_11]: but yeah Apples to Apples will be interesting it would be cool like and if this is what they're talking about I'm not sure but like if the Xbox can play Facebook that might be interesting because it'll make it way more likely that you could actually play your friends but I'm not I don't know I'm not giving them that much credit that seems kind of complicated but it would be really cool if they can get that to work somehow so there you go Apples to Apples coming soon

02:03:57.495 --> 02:03:59.116
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to our mailbag.

02:03:59.557 --> 02:04:04.901
[SPEAKER_11]: Every week you guys send us emails and DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and reads them.

02:04:05.662 --> 02:04:09.384
[SPEAKER_11]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.

02:04:09.925 --> 02:04:10.505
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a few.

02:04:10.906 --> 02:04:12.507
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, good, because we were off a week.

02:04:12.627 --> 02:04:12.827
[SPEAKER_11]: A few.

02:04:14.929 --> 02:04:17.471
[SPEAKER_07]: So first off, hey guys, Moulton Brown here.

02:04:18.051 --> 02:04:21.594
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard you talking about rugby games last week and I felt I had to chime in.

02:04:22.074 --> 02:04:25.096
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing rugby for six years now and it is awesome!

02:04:25.797 --> 02:04:31.781
[SPEAKER_07]: I am really happy with the increase in rugby games this year considering how popular the sport is worldwide.

02:04:32.321 --> 02:04:36.784
[SPEAKER_07]: Regarding the increase, I may be because the Rugby World Cup is going on right now.

02:04:37.785 --> 02:04:41.788
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say more, but I'm not feeling well, so I'm just going to peace out, later Molten Brown.

02:05:08.291 --> 02:05:08.652
[SPEAKER_07]: DragCave.net

02:05:26.831 --> 02:05:28.892
[SPEAKER_07]: Any tips if you guys have played it?

02:05:29.052 --> 02:05:31.413
[SPEAKER_07]: It strikes me as a much nicer sort of Neopets.

02:05:31.673 --> 02:05:32.453
[SPEAKER_07]: That's from Holly.

02:05:32.594 --> 02:05:35.115
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just about to say, I'm hearing Neopets.

02:05:35.595 --> 02:05:36.315
[SPEAKER_11]: But interesting.

02:05:36.355 --> 02:05:40.357
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's something you put it in your signature and you get a lot of clicks and people hatch it.

02:05:41.037 --> 02:05:45.859
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good get people on our website scheme.

02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:48.880
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of smart.

02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:49.640
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.

02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:50.781
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've never played it.

02:05:50.941 --> 02:05:51.621
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked at the site.

02:05:51.641 --> 02:05:52.401
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks kind of neat.

02:05:52.501 --> 02:05:53.342
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, I haven't tried it.

02:05:53.442 --> 02:05:53.722
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

02:05:54.042 --> 02:05:57.269
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, yeah, I can't say a whole lot on that, but I'll have to look at it.

02:05:58.699 --> 02:05:59.559
[SPEAKER_07]: We got one from Robaba.

02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:00.640
[SPEAKER_07]: Robaba!

02:06:01.381 --> 02:06:08.848
[SPEAKER_07]: The Paranormal Pinball Table is apparently free on Xbox Live Arcade this week with only a few days left when you broadcast.

02:06:08.968 --> 02:06:11.530
[SPEAKER_07]: Zen Pinball on PSN has had it for months.

02:06:12.091 --> 02:06:18.937
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the narrator of the game is supposed to be a Sam Spade soundalike, but it is clearly the actor who voices Peter Griffin on The Family Guy.

02:06:19.317 --> 02:06:19.678
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my.

02:06:20.078 --> 02:06:24.302
[SPEAKER_07]: Still, it's a fun table that may be guilty of trying to do too many things at once.

02:06:24.742 --> 02:06:29.443
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, isn't Peter Griffin the creator of the show?

02:06:29.663 --> 02:06:48.529
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Peter, it's Seth MacFarlane I don't think they would have got him to do a video game They must just sound really similar I'm looking at the table itself, just for a moment And it kind of seems to me like, yeah, it's trying to be sort of like Twilight Zone Although the ramps are crazy on it, wow

02:06:50.089 --> 02:06:51.349
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm pissed I forgot to get this.

02:06:51.369 --> 02:06:57.491
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably like a knockoff of Twilight Zone versus Whodunit, you know.

02:06:58.291 --> 02:07:03.792
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, okay, we have one from, I'm just, oh, it's from CD Thunder, okay.

02:07:04.193 --> 02:07:09.774
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR, I went to the mall recently and played in the game room for a while.

02:07:10.214 --> 02:07:14.155
[SPEAKER_07]: During my visit, I noticed that two of my favorite games were gone, Carnival and House of the Dead.

02:07:14.475 --> 02:07:15.955
[SPEAKER_11]: At least you have a game room still.

02:07:16.336 --> 02:07:18.196
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, at least you have an arcade with actual games.

02:07:18.536 --> 02:07:19.497
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'll see you next time.

02:07:43.624 --> 02:07:45.345
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole sale of arcade games too.

02:07:46.665 --> 02:07:47.826
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that place at the Metreon?

02:07:47.866 --> 02:07:49.566
[SPEAKER_11]: Tilt was selling a bunch of games.

02:07:49.646 --> 02:07:50.947
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually they are going to be a couple hundred dollars.

02:07:51.187 --> 02:08:01.572
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep in mind, dude, you got just a whole game console slash television slash stand-up cabinet slash fancy controller all dedicated to one game.

02:08:01.632 --> 02:08:02.872
[SPEAKER_11]: That does cost a couple hundred bucks.

02:08:02.892 --> 02:08:03.793
[SPEAKER_09]: You can look at Craigslist.

02:08:03.813 --> 02:08:06.814
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find a lot of old arcade games for that kind of price.

02:08:08.415 --> 02:08:09.635
[SPEAKER_09]: Cabinets are about that price.

02:08:09.935 --> 02:08:11.336
[SPEAKER_09]: The more elaborate, the more expensive.

02:08:12.015 --> 02:08:33.795
[SPEAKER_07]: someday when I have a house I'll have some arcade machines someday alright so we ready for the next email yes okay hello OLR since we are near the release of Sonic Generations this Tuesday I thought you guys would like to compare some of the music from the game yeah there's remixes up Rob you should probably pull this email because of the remixes on here sure I'll pull it up right now

02:08:34.655 --> 02:08:42.736
[SPEAKER_07]: but it has a classic remix of Speed Highway from Sonic Adventure which was one of my favorite pieces of music in that game.

02:08:43.437 --> 02:08:51.598
[SPEAKER_07]: A modernized Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone, and a classic rooftop run from Sonic Unleashed which I didn't think I played.

02:08:52.138 --> 02:08:58.799
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, it's worth pointing out the 3DS version of Sonic Generations out on November 22nd has its own set of levels to make it unique.

02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:02.180
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, turn this up so I can hear this.

02:09:13.069 --> 02:09:14.670
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been hearing a lot of good things about Sonic Generations.

02:09:14.690 --> 02:09:17.231
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to post this one on the Tumblr.

02:09:17.531 --> 02:09:18.071
[SPEAKER_07]: Go for it.

02:09:18.172 --> 02:09:26.836
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it's also reporting that the 3DS version of Sonic Generations has its own set of levels to make it unique from the PC 360 and PS3 versions.

02:09:27.356 --> 02:09:29.497
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you and your listeners enjoy sampling these tracks.

02:09:29.737 --> 02:09:30.317
[SPEAKER_07]: Good day.

02:09:30.978 --> 02:09:33.499
[SPEAKER_07]: And this comes from Full Brazilian.

02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:34.940
[SPEAKER_11]: Ouch.

02:09:45.533 --> 02:09:48.697
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, last one.

02:09:49.879 --> 02:09:50.860
[SPEAKER_11]: Chemical Plant Zone.

02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:52.322
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll skip ahead a little bit in this song here.

02:09:54.605 --> 02:09:54.845
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.

02:09:55.206 --> 02:09:55.386
Come on.

02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:03.040
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like this one as much.

02:10:03.441 --> 02:10:06.622
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really like that Speed Highway.

02:10:06.642 --> 02:10:11.664
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see the gameplay.

02:10:14.005 --> 02:10:15.785
[SPEAKER_11]: This looks pretty sweet, actually.

02:10:18.026 --> 02:10:19.747
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I saw a little bit of it.

02:10:19.827 --> 02:10:20.927
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do want that.

02:10:20.947 --> 02:10:29.731
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it looks like it's really going back to some of the Sonic Adventure stuff.

02:10:31.437 --> 02:10:34.719
[SPEAKER_07]: Which Sonic Adventure is probably one of, it's on my list of favorites.

02:10:35.179 --> 02:10:39.821
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I gotta be honest, I haven't been paying this game much attention because let's be real.

02:10:40.121 --> 02:10:41.042
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we all be real for a minute?

02:10:41.502 --> 02:10:43.663
[SPEAKER_11]: Sonic's been really shitty for a long time.

02:10:43.903 --> 02:10:52.868
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, like especially once Sonic 4 kind of came out and it was kind of a thud, you know, like I just kind of say, oh, Sonic game, I'm sure it's more shit.

02:10:53.548 --> 02:10:56.590
[SPEAKER_11]: But I gotta say, I'm looking at that, that looks nice.

02:10:58.795 --> 02:11:00.136
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me look at another.

02:11:00.316 --> 02:11:04.400
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that I'm fucking on this, I want to see another little video here.

02:11:04.420 --> 02:11:09.444
[SPEAKER_11]: Looks like somebody made a tutorial here.

02:11:09.464 --> 02:11:13.548
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's that same area.

02:11:13.588 --> 02:11:14.689
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me skip ahead a lot here.

02:11:15.376 --> 02:11:15.656
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:11:16.076 --> 02:11:18.398
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll go ahead and read the next email if you want.

02:11:18.418 --> 02:11:18.718
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:11:19.178 --> 02:11:20.879
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm entranced by the Sonic video.

02:11:20.919 --> 02:11:21.780
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks pretty awesome.

02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:22.320
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:11:23.041 --> 02:11:26.463
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's sort of... God, it makes me want to barf from all the motion, though.

02:11:26.483 --> 02:11:32.807
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes from like a 2.5D to a full, you know, Sonic Adventure style.

02:11:33.087 --> 02:11:33.387
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:11:33.928 --> 02:11:34.108
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

02:11:34.888 --> 02:11:38.050
[SPEAKER_07]: Really want... Actually, you know what game this makes me think of right off the bat?

02:11:38.170 --> 02:11:38.771
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

02:11:38.791 --> 02:11:39.291
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic CD.

02:11:42.364 --> 02:11:43.606
[SPEAKER_07]: with how fluid it is.

02:11:43.666 --> 02:11:44.648
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to hear from the chat room.

02:11:44.668 --> 02:11:45.990
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you guys in chat been playing this?

02:11:46.210 --> 02:11:47.332
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it good?

02:11:47.392 --> 02:11:49.455
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this a Sonic game that I should be paying attention to?

02:11:50.937 --> 02:11:53.341
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is this one of those things that looks cool but it doesn't play so hot?

02:11:54.969 --> 02:11:56.370
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a place pretty classic, though.

02:11:57.171 --> 02:11:59.052
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so shall I go ahead and give you the last two?

02:11:59.092 --> 02:12:00.533
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'll close the video.

02:12:00.573 --> 02:12:01.334
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you can keep watching.

02:12:01.354 --> 02:12:02.855
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

02:12:02.875 --> 02:12:12.101
[SPEAKER_07]: Weeks after Cliffy slammed a site for giving Gears 3 an 8.0, the big sites are running stories about gamers criticizing Uncharted 3 getting an 8 score as well.

02:12:12.521 --> 02:12:22.749
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I off base here, or do you think the more the vocal gamers, disregarding the factors that lead to the number score, are more willing to accept a 4 out of 5 rating as being a great game over an 8 of 10 being an 80% or an 80%?

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:43.768
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep on Robert M. It really is a matter of numbers and perception because with a 4 out of 5, you've got that 4 so close to the top line, but then an 8, though, has two more levels of gradation between it, even though it is, in theory, the exact same ratings.

02:12:45.575 --> 02:12:47.377
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's just a matter of perception.

02:12:47.637 --> 02:12:49.359
[SPEAKER_07]: People are easily swayed.

02:12:50.661 --> 02:12:52.303
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't look at the numbers, look at the content.

02:12:52.423 --> 02:12:53.184
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I have to say.

02:12:53.364 --> 02:12:59.911
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ironic because one of the things I got linked to in our chat room as you're reading that email is the Metacritic for Sonic Generations.

02:13:00.752 --> 02:13:03.075
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm kind of taking a look at some of the scores.

02:13:03.135 --> 02:13:05.537
[SPEAKER_11]: It has a 77 on Metacritic, which, you know, I don't...

02:13:06.571 --> 02:13:32.554
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to really watch these websites because you're not going to necessarily agree with one or the other But some people on here, it has 77 overall, nobody's rated it anything higher than like an 8.5 But some folks are saying it's good, it's polished, but then some of the people that are dogging it a little bit Like say it's not as good as Colors, it's not very creative, and it feels like filler

02:13:34.469 --> 02:13:44.823
[SPEAKER_11]: and uh saying that it's just their shoehorning old Sonic games interesting of course if they want me to spend 60 bucks on it it's got to be better than average right

02:13:46.007 --> 02:13:48.928
[SPEAKER_11]: So, maybe we'll get some calls on that later, I don't know.

02:13:49.068 --> 02:13:49.869
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else in the mailbag?

02:13:50.249 --> 02:13:50.869
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we do.

02:13:51.049 --> 02:13:51.329
[SPEAKER_11]: Alrighty.

02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:54.290
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as I get back to the email.

02:13:54.350 --> 02:14:00.033
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the last one is, hi OLR, it's your family neighborhood spazinator.

02:14:00.713 --> 02:14:09.237
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't have a gaming related topic for this week's show, but rather I was hoping that the three of you could possibly send out a happy birthday wish to a first time listener.

02:14:09.437 --> 02:14:09.617
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

02:14:10.337 --> 02:14:35.008
[SPEAKER_07]: yes all right my best friend Angie aka Gigi whose birthday is today that's 11-6 I couldn't possibly ask for a better friend than her thanks in advance okay happy birthday Gigi happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday to you from Orange Lounge Radio you need to come up with an OLR birthday song

02:14:36.733 --> 02:14:37.654
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your birthday.

02:14:37.774 --> 02:14:38.534
[SPEAKER_07]: Good for you.

02:14:39.375 --> 02:14:40.196
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your birthday.

02:14:40.276 --> 02:14:41.136
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's some poo.

02:14:44.679 --> 02:14:45.900
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy birthday for reals.

02:14:46.921 --> 02:14:47.341
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

02:14:47.521 --> 02:14:49.483
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, or there's this.

02:14:49.563 --> 02:14:49.763
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

02:14:49.803 --> 02:14:50.764
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see if I can do this here.

02:14:51.684 --> 02:14:53.246
[SPEAKER_11]: We could do happy birthday this way.

02:14:55.808 --> 02:14:56.068
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

02:14:56.128 --> 02:14:56.368
[SPEAKER_11]: Play.

02:14:57.509 --> 02:14:58.049
[SPEAKER_11]: Play, fool.

02:15:01.272 --> 02:15:02.172
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this is so irritating.

02:15:02.232 --> 02:15:04.574
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm waiting for someone to click the freaking play button on this.

02:15:04.634 --> 02:15:04.955
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

02:15:05.235 --> 02:15:05.475
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

02:15:13.979 --> 02:15:15.420
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Happy Birthday and Mario Paint.

02:15:17.301 --> 02:15:18.181
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know something, Rob?

02:15:18.502 --> 02:15:18.902
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried.

02:15:18.982 --> 02:15:19.722
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know something?

02:15:19.862 --> 02:15:22.084
[SPEAKER_07]: That song actually is still under copyright law.

02:15:22.724 --> 02:15:26.606
[SPEAKER_07]: And that if more than 25 people perform it in public, you can be sued for public performance.

02:15:27.306 --> 02:15:29.288
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, you know what you're going to get from me?

02:15:29.788 --> 02:15:30.788
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing, because I'm broke.

02:15:30.848 --> 02:15:31.909
[SPEAKER_07]: How about some farts?

02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:33.250
[SPEAKER_07]: I can spare that.

02:15:35.051 --> 02:15:36.872
[SPEAKER_07]: I have farts in your general direction.

02:15:37.752 --> 02:15:38.373
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that's it.

02:15:38.993 --> 02:15:40.094
[SPEAKER_11]: I played under 30 seconds.

02:15:40.114 --> 02:15:40.654
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fair use.

02:15:41.078 --> 02:15:42.519
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that's it for the Mailbag.

02:15:42.559 --> 02:15:43.240
[SPEAKER_11]: Send us emails.

02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:44.121
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll read your emails.

02:15:44.141 --> 02:15:46.062
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess now we'll do your birthday wishes on the show.

02:15:46.122 --> 02:15:49.005
[SPEAKER_11]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Because Jamie's nice.

02:15:49.305 --> 02:15:55.330
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Don't catch her when she's in a bad mood or she'll tell your friend, So what?

02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:56.351
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your birthday.

02:15:56.471 --> 02:15:57.352
[SPEAKER_11]: Screw you!

02:15:58.032 --> 02:16:02.036
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe, just maybe, she'll mention you during a segment we call the FUs of the Week.

02:16:18.357 --> 02:16:23.980
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU of the week goes to the cold that I've had for the last two weeks, especially since I got sick at Disneyland.

02:16:28.263 --> 02:16:42.191
[SPEAKER_07]: And a secondary FU goes towards... I'm really trying to be understanding and thoughtful, but... Learn how to package an InDesign file, please.

02:16:43.504 --> 02:16:50.692
[SPEAKER_07]: instead of having me have to go back and fix all of the damn work because it was not packaged properly with all the proper links intact.

02:16:50.832 --> 02:16:51.994
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fuck you InDesign.

02:16:52.034 --> 02:16:52.834
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you so much.

02:16:52.895 --> 02:16:53.896
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you, but fuck you.

02:16:54.496 --> 02:16:54.877
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

02:16:56.939 --> 02:16:57.259
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki?

02:16:58.921 --> 02:16:59.101
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

02:17:01.323 --> 02:17:14.931
[SPEAKER_09]: MPU to Activision, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3 it's always a pain in the ass every goddamn year when it launches just with all the regulation and this customer can't have it this time and everybody's calling it bitching and

02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:31.010
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna sue and blah blah blah and yadda yadda yadda And so, yeah, fuck you to Call of Duty My FU of the week goes to the country fried steak I had this morning Cause seriously, deep fried steak?

02:17:31.190 --> 02:17:32.231
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, what the hell's that?

02:17:33.732 --> 02:17:41.497
[SPEAKER_11]: But, actually it was really good, that's why I'm giving it an FU Cause FU to the fact that I'll have to play like two hours of Damn Central 2 to work that off

02:17:43.879 --> 02:17:55.267
[SPEAKER_11]: If you had a good tasting food being so bad for you Alright, more news stories and then we're going to get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR but not just yet, we still have some more news stories Loki

02:17:55.939 --> 02:18:01.321
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, of course, one of the things we like to complain about is pay-to-unlock content.

02:18:01.361 --> 02:18:05.802
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically content that's DLC that's already on the disc.

02:18:06.043 --> 02:18:13.025
[SPEAKER_09]: And so one such game, the high-profile game you might add, that has such a thing would be Gears of War 3.

02:18:13.725 --> 02:18:18.247
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, the creator, Rod Ferguson...

02:18:19.447 --> 02:18:26.453
[SPEAKER_09]: is defending why they do have paid unlock content or DLC that's already on the disc.

02:18:26.493 --> 02:18:27.454
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't wait to hear this.

02:18:28.528 --> 02:18:30.810
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically saying... I love this.

02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:33.592
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not saying everything on the disc is product.

02:18:34.852 --> 02:18:37.354
[SPEAKER_09]: The disc is another delivery mechanism.

02:18:38.475 --> 02:18:53.545
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically their thought is that because the game was actually done back in the spring and they kind of held it until the fall, they had already created some of this download content that was going to be put out there.

02:18:55.546 --> 02:18:56.287
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically...

02:18:58.248 --> 02:19:11.110
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they wanted... The first piece of download content had some guns and maps and stuff that they needed to have the data for for people that didn't buy it so that you could play with those people and whatnot.

02:19:12.411 --> 02:19:18.172
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of just having you download all that again, they just put it on a disk to make it easier so you didn't have to download everything.

02:19:18.432 --> 02:19:23.833
[SPEAKER_09]: But obviously, going forward, any other download content will be... The entire contents will have to be downloaded.

02:19:24.653 --> 02:19:24.733
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

02:19:26.333 --> 02:19:32.656
[SPEAKER_09]: They said we felt it was a win-win because no one is going to have to download anything huge when the DLC comes out.

02:19:36.578 --> 02:19:46.622
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that, but I think the whole problem with people seeing this is you get things like with the Catwoman DLC and stuff where it's already on disc, but...

02:19:47.302 --> 02:19:51.466
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, obviously if you didn't buy the game new, you have to pay to unlock the content.

02:19:51.526 --> 02:19:54.309
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you do have like 200 megs you download, because I just did that today.

02:19:54.329 --> 02:19:56.511
[SPEAKER_11]: It's downloading something.

02:19:56.571 --> 02:19:57.933
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so that is download content.

02:19:58.453 --> 02:20:00.255
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, Katamari.

02:20:00.295 --> 02:20:01.216
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the beautiful Katamari.

02:20:01.236 --> 02:20:05.460
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful Katamari had, you know, a lot of pay to unlock levels and stuff like that.

02:20:06.141 --> 02:20:07.102
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not, you know...

02:20:07.702 --> 02:20:08.383
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

02:20:34.107 --> 02:20:37.749
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the thing that makes it muddy for people is when it's on disc.

02:20:38.970 --> 02:20:46.674
[SPEAKER_09]: We could have left it off and, you know, hey, here's another disc, but they believe that they did the right thing.

02:20:49.884 --> 02:20:50.124
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:21:03.808 --> 02:21:07.552
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember having the keys, Dead Rising has costumes and stuff.

02:21:09.755 --> 02:21:10.756
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of games that do it.

02:21:10.936 --> 02:21:11.978
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's kind of lame.

02:21:12.779 --> 02:21:14.641
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you have this stuff done.

02:21:15.101 --> 02:21:21.730
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like the game was... I mean, I get some games are delayed or purposefully held to come out at a certain time.

02:21:22.430 --> 02:21:25.011
[SPEAKER_09]: But not all games are like that.

02:21:25.131 --> 02:21:35.536
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of games where it's like, okay, we added some extra DLC content, like the Earth Defense Force expansions were already on the disc, all those weapons, and they're charging people for it.

02:21:35.876 --> 02:21:38.037
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we take a minute to praise somebody that did it right?

02:21:38.297 --> 02:21:40.618
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would be the folks behind Burnout Paradise.

02:21:41.398 --> 02:22:10.195
[SPEAKER_11]: and you want to talk about combating used game sales well the way you combat used game sales is to make people want to keep the game and not want to sell it back by doing regular content updates dude what if you'd instead of having you know people pay to unlock the additional content that's on the disc why not slowly unlock that content over you know every couple months something new unlocks give people reason to hold on to their games and not want to sell them used what a novel idea

02:22:13.414 --> 02:22:33.555
[SPEAKER_09]: or you know then you have also besides the slowly unlocking content you have some really cool download content later on that you know it's like you know people that sell their games back like man man I really need to buy that again so I can buy this download content that's good download content if you know you're willing to rebuy that game to play that content

02:22:34.494 --> 02:22:53.165
[SPEAKER_11]: Spazinator PC in our chatroom says this begs a question though at which point will we have $60 for a game then pay additional money to unlock the whole game how about the new Mortal Kombat game that came out I mean you had to pay money for the extra characters I mean I guess you could say that's extra or whatever but how about Arkham City

02:22:54.065 --> 02:23:03.371
[SPEAKER_11]: The Catwoman stuff, I guess you could say, okay, well, the code does come with the game, but, you know, there are a bunch of trophies and story elements that if you don't have that code, you're not going to get.

02:23:03.691 --> 02:23:07.193
[SPEAKER_11]: Or, heaven forbid, you got one of those boxes where the code was missing.

02:23:08.774 --> 02:23:13.116
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though, I guess, Warner Brothers has a little workaround, but still, it's an awful inconvenience to the consumer.

02:23:14.937 --> 02:23:16.158
[SPEAKER_09]: Battlefield had the same problem.

02:23:16.839 --> 02:23:17.239
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

02:23:18.940 --> 02:23:19.540
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean...

02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:25.390
[SPEAKER_11]: It's amazing.

02:23:25.410 --> 02:23:33.595
[SPEAKER_11]: If you just think of the long term, I bet you could combat used game sales easy by continuing to provide the regular content to keep it exciting.

02:23:33.935 --> 02:23:35.336
[SPEAKER_07]: Arkham City, for example.

02:23:36.076 --> 02:23:38.758
[SPEAKER_07]: You beat the game, but you haven't finished the game.

02:23:39.298 --> 02:23:40.279
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so much more to do.

02:23:42.515 --> 02:23:48.020
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, there is a big show coming up in a couple weeks where they show a lot of arcade games.

02:23:48.641 --> 02:23:55.728
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the rumors going around about this upcoming arcade show is that Bejeweled is going to show up as an amusement title.

02:23:56.129 --> 02:23:58.912
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, apparently one of the biggest casual games ever.

02:23:59.432 --> 02:24:02.476
[SPEAKER_11]: Sega Amusements is supposed to be showing this.

02:24:02.576 --> 02:24:04.818
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this could just be a huge rumor already.

02:24:04.978 --> 02:24:09.580
[SPEAKER_11]: But they are saying that Bejeweled could be just like Fruit Ninja, Infinity Blade, and so forth.

02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:13.621
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be making its way from a casual game to the arcade.

02:24:13.981 --> 02:24:14.901
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's my question.

02:24:14.941 --> 02:24:16.222
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to spit out tickets?

02:24:17.662 --> 02:24:20.823
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that seems to be the only way that games last in the arcade these days.

02:24:21.303 --> 02:24:23.204
[SPEAKER_11]: What would you guys think of a Bejeweled arcade game?

02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:50.941
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't play it I like Bejeweled and if it spits out tickets it'll be a good ticket spitting game it's like sad that I'm admitting this but otherwise would I pay to play it in the arcades not unless it gives me some type of experience I can't get at home which I doubt unless it's like I don't know really somehow touch based and somehow really fun and different but I just don't see how many ways you do Bejeweled

02:24:51.161 --> 02:24:54.747
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get me wrong, but Jeweled's a great game, but is it worth 50 cents to play good?

02:24:55.047 --> 02:24:55.829
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.

02:24:57.571 --> 02:24:59.695
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we'll see.

02:25:02.436 --> 02:25:05.798
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

02:25:05.898 --> 02:25:08.980
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, while I try to get the live stream up, because we crashed again.

02:25:09.181 --> 02:25:09.781
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, boo.

02:25:10.661 --> 02:25:14.464
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, LEGO Universe is going away.

02:25:15.405 --> 02:25:16.765
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so sad.

02:25:17.906 --> 02:25:21.488
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're not getting enough players.

02:25:21.669 --> 02:25:29.193
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't got enough players and enough paying subscribers, so LEGO Universe is going to be closing on January 31st, 2012.

02:25:32.155 --> 02:25:39.298
[SPEAKER_07]: and they are also going to be closing the Playwall Studio which will be laying off 115 people.

02:25:41.139 --> 02:25:41.599
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadness.

02:25:42.739 --> 02:25:43.280
[SPEAKER_11]: That is sad.

02:25:43.380 --> 02:25:44.640
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, more job losses.

02:25:44.660 --> 02:25:45.040
[SPEAKER_11]: That's sad.

02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:48.742
[SPEAKER_11]: But I didn't even... Okay, this is sad but I didn't even realize LEGO Universe was out.

02:25:50.302 --> 02:25:51.863
[SPEAKER_11]: It was supposed to be this big MMO, right?

02:25:51.923 --> 02:25:53.444
[SPEAKER_11]: It came out about a year ago.

02:25:53.784 --> 02:25:55.885
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it supposed to be out on DS or something?

02:25:55.965 --> 02:25:58.066
[SPEAKER_11]: It was supposed to be an MMO on the 3DS or something?

02:25:58.506 --> 02:25:59.166
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I crazy?

02:25:59.486 --> 02:26:00.487
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you're thinking of...

02:26:03.121 --> 02:26:03.682
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, what is it?

02:26:03.782 --> 02:26:05.625
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the one that's like Grand Theft Auto.

02:26:05.705 --> 02:26:11.974
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Lego City Stories, which I will be buying.

02:26:12.294 --> 02:26:13.015
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, that's it.

02:26:13.196 --> 02:26:14.537
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be buying Lego City Stories.

02:26:14.558 --> 02:26:16.200
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I got to confuse Lego City Stories.

02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:18.443
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that is Grand Theft Auto Lego.

02:26:18.463 --> 02:26:19.024
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:26:19.761 --> 02:26:24.784
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's basically not enough players, not enough paying people, so they can't afford to keep it open.

02:26:24.904 --> 02:26:26.645
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting that they didn't decide to go free to play.

02:26:26.665 --> 02:26:28.046
[SPEAKER_11]: Or no, they already were free to play, weren't they?

02:26:28.066 --> 02:26:28.586
[SPEAKER_11]: They did free to play.

02:26:28.606 --> 02:26:29.006
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, bummer.

02:26:29.527 --> 02:26:36.071
[SPEAKER_07]: And the quote says, it has not been possible to convert a satisfactory number of players to paying subscribers.

02:26:36.191 --> 02:26:37.691
[SPEAKER_11]: In other words, ain't no one playing this.

02:26:38.092 --> 02:26:39.653
[SPEAKER_07]: No, ain't no one paying for it.

02:26:40.273 --> 02:26:41.494
[SPEAKER_07]: They just want to play the free stuff.

02:26:42.154 --> 02:26:42.574
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

02:26:42.614 --> 02:26:43.555
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to pay for content.

02:26:44.435 --> 02:26:44.835
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure!

02:26:45.575 --> 02:26:48.996
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course people just want to play the free stuff.

02:26:49.537 --> 02:26:51.657
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious to see if DC Universe is able to make money.

02:26:52.437 --> 02:26:53.038
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be interesting.

02:26:53.238 --> 02:26:53.758
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sure.

02:26:54.618 --> 02:26:57.199
[SPEAKER_11]: They have enough goodies.

02:26:57.639 --> 02:27:01.580
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you pay five bucks for it, for content, you get an account upgrade.

02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:03.281
[SPEAKER_07]: The same thing is with Star Trek Online.

02:27:03.401 --> 02:27:08.042
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why when I start Star Trek Online, I'm automatically going in with the middle level account.

02:27:08.462 --> 02:27:08.962
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's cool.

02:27:09.243 --> 02:27:10.704
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you paid for it in the past.

02:27:11.144 --> 02:27:21.932
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apart from, yeah, my subscription, I also bought Cryptic Points so that I could get the extra uniforms and the other ship and stuff.

02:27:22.192 --> 02:27:22.813
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, alright.

02:27:23.893 --> 02:27:26.736
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, I haven't spent more than $20 outside on that game.

02:27:27.477 --> 02:27:33.462
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're going to get into the Skype line and your Twitter topics at twitter.com.

02:27:33.642 --> 02:27:35.424
[SPEAKER_11]: So last chance to get those in.

02:27:35.844 --> 02:27:37.186
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

02:27:37.286 --> 02:27:43.371
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so as we mentioned before, the Mass Effect 3 beta has leaked out.

02:27:45.073 --> 02:27:47.996
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently there was a private closed beta for Mass Effect 3.

02:27:48.817 --> 02:27:54.081
[SPEAKER_09]: and somehow they kind of accidentally threw it up on there for everybody to download.

02:27:54.202 --> 02:27:58.325
[SPEAKER_09]: It gives people access to both single player and multiplayer sections of the game.

02:27:58.925 --> 02:28:14.518
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, because of that, there's been lots of screenshots and whatnot showing different things like origin support, multiplayer character creation, level selection, stats, new user interfaces and whatnot.

02:28:15.119 --> 02:28:17.000
[SPEAKER_09]: So, neat.

02:28:18.021 --> 02:28:22.184
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the game will be coming out in February or March.

02:28:22.224 --> 02:28:23.025
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's spring.

02:28:24.646 --> 02:28:25.767
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of stuff coming out in the spring.

02:28:29.530 --> 02:28:29.950
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:28:30.471 --> 02:28:32.432
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, Mass Effect is going to be a huge one, though.

02:28:32.592 --> 02:28:34.334
[SPEAKER_11]: But oops on that leak, right?

02:28:34.714 --> 02:28:35.675
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

02:28:36.495 --> 02:28:38.397
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not really a closed beta if you put it out for everybody.

02:28:39.457 --> 02:28:41.659
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that was a Microsoft boo-boo from what I understand.

02:28:41.759 --> 02:28:43.981
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, I would be pissed if I were them.

02:28:45.416 --> 02:29:10.748
[SPEAKER_11]: so alright moving on to one more story for you guys and this goes back to the music games DDR of course getting a new version but they're redoing second mix remember we talked about the new arcade mix it's going to have second mix inside it well to celebrate Dance Dance Revolution X3 versus second mix there's going to be a new second mix soundtrack that includes remixes they are remixing Keep On Movin' by Y&Co Y&Co

02:29:13.389 --> 02:29:28.236
[SPEAKER_11]: Put Your Faith in Me by DA's Twinkly Disco Remix Trip Machine, the Zack Nanoglide mix Brilliant to You, the AKBK mix and Paranoia, the KST mix and Love is the Power, Reborn

02:29:28.556 --> 02:29:57.243
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember a song called Love is the Power I think it was one of the menu ones Oh, that's why, got it And apparently there's going to be a special DVD that has videos for Butterfly, Boom Boom Dollar, and Brilliant to You Interviews with Naoki, U1, DJ Taka, Y&Co, so on and so on That's all coming out November 30th is when the soundtrack comes out That means the arcade game is going to be out soon I kind of want to go play it just to play second mix mode Forget these newfangled songs

02:29:57.682 --> 02:29:58.202
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, Rob?

02:29:58.402 --> 02:29:58.582
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

02:29:58.722 --> 02:30:01.003
[SPEAKER_07]: I could hook up the Dreamcast and we could play Second Mix.

02:30:01.103 --> 02:30:04.925
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just not the same as a pretty high-def TV.

02:30:05.125 --> 02:30:08.887
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't we have a story a couple weeks ago about how they were redoing the graphics in HD and all that?

02:30:08.987 --> 02:30:10.667
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounded kind of neat.

02:30:11.047 --> 02:30:13.748
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, for us super music game nerd fans, it sounded super neat.

02:30:13.768 --> 02:30:14.249
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

02:30:14.609 --> 02:30:14.789
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

02:30:15.769 --> 02:30:22.512
[SPEAKER_07]: I completely forgot that it was on my phone, but I actually giggled in my car the other day because Love came on my iPhone.

02:30:22.652 --> 02:30:23.092
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really?

02:30:23.532 --> 02:30:27.394
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot I had the Sonic Dreams CD when it came out.

02:30:27.616 --> 02:30:28.007
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice

02:30:31.132 --> 02:30:32.693
[SPEAKER_11]: Love is the Power is the Ending of Second Mix

02:30:59.668 --> 02:31:07.813
[SPEAKER_11]: Nico Nico-chan tweeted us this week at twitter.com slash OLR and put, have any of you played the game Hyperdimension Neptunia?

02:31:08.834 --> 02:31:10.015
[SPEAKER_11]: Does this sound familiar to anyone?

02:31:10.255 --> 02:31:11.275
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it does sound familiar.

02:31:12.516 --> 02:31:13.457
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to read up on it.

02:31:13.517 --> 02:31:14.538
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the PlayStation 3.

02:31:15.598 --> 02:31:19.241
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's kind of like, well, this is what I thought was interesting.

02:31:19.341 --> 02:31:26.025
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the console wars as represented by female anime chicks.

02:31:26.045 --> 02:31:26.245
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:31:27.106 --> 02:31:28.146
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, there's that.

02:31:28.166 --> 02:31:29.687
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't expect Animatrix to be female.

02:31:29.907 --> 02:31:32.687
[SPEAKER_11]: There's two things that made me think this was very interesting.

02:31:32.727 --> 02:31:40.749
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of them was the fact that it's by the company Compile Heart, which is actually the dude that used to lead Compile, I guess, made this company.

02:31:41.129 --> 02:31:43.730
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, granted, he left in like 2006 or something like that.

02:31:43.790 --> 02:31:44.750
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know.

02:31:45.090 --> 02:31:49.711
[SPEAKER_11]: It kind of gave me hope for like just half a second that maybe just possibly someday...

02:31:51.735 --> 02:31:56.908
[SPEAKER_11]: They could come back with another version of The Guardian Legend.

02:31:57.791 --> 02:31:58.531
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope so.

02:31:58.951 --> 02:32:01.052
[SPEAKER_07]: Or at least another Guardia game.

02:32:01.432 --> 02:32:01.612
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:32:01.792 --> 02:32:06.813
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, maybe the franchise could totally work touched up for the modern era.

02:32:07.073 --> 02:32:07.334
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

02:32:07.994 --> 02:32:08.214
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:32:08.594 --> 02:32:15.256
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was going to try to bring up the YouTube, but we're having to deal on the podcast right now with the Internet feed being down.

02:32:15.316 --> 02:32:18.156
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't even bring up YouTube because our Internet is completely down right now.

02:32:18.176 --> 02:32:18.877
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not even live.

02:32:19.577 --> 02:32:20.517
[SPEAKER_11]: Live listeners can't hear us.

02:32:20.697 --> 02:32:23.398
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm left with nothing but Twitter because no one can call us either.

02:32:24.898 --> 02:32:25.679
[SPEAKER_11]: So let me go to Twitter.

02:32:25.699 --> 02:32:26.759
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm keeping an eye on it, Rob.

02:32:26.919 --> 02:32:27.420
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, thank you.

02:32:28.220 --> 02:32:31.562
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to Surtur on the Twitter says, I have a new Android phone.

02:32:31.622 --> 02:32:32.642
[SPEAKER_11]: What are some good games?

02:32:33.003 --> 02:32:33.943
[SPEAKER_11]: Free or money?

02:32:34.323 --> 02:32:35.044
[SPEAKER_11]: LoveOLR.

02:32:35.244 --> 02:32:35.604
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

02:32:36.905 --> 02:32:37.725
[SPEAKER_11]: Android games.

02:32:37.985 --> 02:32:39.766
[SPEAKER_11]: We all have iOS.

02:32:40.327 --> 02:32:44.429
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a shitty Android, so I don't play anything on there.

02:32:46.290 --> 02:32:54.078
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, a lot of the games that are on iOS are also on Android, so I'm sure there's pretty much a lot of stuff crosses over.

02:32:55.179 --> 02:32:59.283
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't think of any Android-specific games that... Get our type.

02:32:59.303 --> 02:33:06.930
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you have a good enough Android phone, I guess, so there's also the PlayStation Suite stuff where you can play old PlayStation 1 games.

02:33:09.013 --> 02:33:14.171
[SPEAKER_09]: MNZiba on Twitter Minecraft If you're into that That's your thing

02:33:17.055 --> 02:33:21.357
[SPEAKER_11]: MNZBud sent us a tweet saying, OLR, I found this while I was walking around Kohl's.

02:33:21.437 --> 02:33:23.018
[SPEAKER_11]: There are so many things wrong with this.

02:33:23.098 --> 02:33:29.800
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't bring up the picture again, but I actually, thankfully, I looked at it before we recorded tonight, and it was like a picture.

02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:31.301
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like a duck hunt game.

02:33:31.581 --> 02:33:32.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I saw that.

02:33:32.341 --> 02:33:33.082
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you see that?

02:33:33.182 --> 02:33:33.982
[SPEAKER_11]: What the heck was that?

02:33:34.022 --> 02:33:34.782
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a duck hunt.

02:33:36.103 --> 02:33:39.444
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming it was one of those plug-and-play kind of style games or something.

02:33:39.464 --> 02:33:40.125
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it just looks...

02:33:41.025 --> 02:33:41.325
[SPEAKER_11]: Derpy.

02:33:41.446 --> 02:33:46.951
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked a little weird, but not completely out of character or whatever for those plug-and-play games.

02:33:50.674 --> 02:33:51.915
[SPEAKER_11]: Quick, we need to fill our topic.

02:33:52.016 --> 02:33:54.478
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to relay a message to the chat room real quick.

02:33:54.498 --> 02:33:55.078
[SPEAKER_11]: It says resolved.

02:33:55.479 --> 02:33:57.221
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, are we able to come back then?

02:33:57.701 --> 02:33:58.502
[SPEAKER_11]: We're connected again.

02:33:59.222 --> 02:33:59.803
[SPEAKER_11]: We're up again?

02:34:00.043 --> 02:34:00.544
[SPEAKER_07]: We're up again.

02:34:01.805 --> 02:34:02.245
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we are.

02:34:02.325 --> 02:34:03.366
[SPEAKER_11]: We are up again.

02:34:03.426 --> 02:34:06.009
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just not on... The chat's.

02:34:07.726 --> 02:34:08.047
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not up yet.

02:34:08.067 --> 02:34:08.948
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm showing you the chat.

02:34:09.028 --> 02:34:10.870
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we just came back on the feed.

02:34:12.952 --> 02:34:13.553
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go.

02:34:15.235 --> 02:34:16.075
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so we're coming back.

02:34:16.096 --> 02:34:22.402
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, podcast listeners, but the fun and joy of doing live radio is that sometimes your interwebs gets all screwed up.

02:34:23.584 --> 02:34:25.726
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were just reading through some tweets, live listeners.

02:34:27.754 --> 02:34:28.014
[SPEAKER_11]: DuckHunter

02:34:54.031 --> 02:35:19.964
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't do it inside either unless you have like a huge studio empty bedroom it makes me think though the dishes are done man all right now I can go to some of these links that Tiger Claw sent us because I wasn't able to pull them up before but on the Twitter twitter.com slash OLR by the way skypline should be back as you guys are reconnecting to the feed 1877 game OLR or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio

02:35:20.744 --> 02:35:39.393
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw had sent us a tweet apparently some bandits stole 6,000 copies of Modern Warfare 3 in France a truck full of copies of the game was hijacked by professional thieves the truck was driving through southern Paris on Saturday and it was rammed by another vehicle

02:35:39.873 --> 02:35:51.256
[SPEAKER_11]: Two men emerged from the colliding car with knives, used tear gas to subdue the driver, and got away with 6,000 video games, which they are valuing at 400,000 euros.

02:35:52.436 --> 02:35:55.297
[SPEAKER_11]: That's crazy, but apparently the game was Modern Warfare 3.

02:35:56.117 --> 02:36:01.198
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you see some early copies on French eBay, you know where it came from.

02:36:02.118 --> 02:36:02.819
[SPEAKER_11]: French eBay?

02:36:02.839 --> 02:36:05.299
[SPEAKER_11]: Get it?

02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:07.620
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go.

02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:08.600
[SPEAKER_09]: French eBay.

02:36:09.614 --> 02:36:10.515
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not Frenchie Bay.

02:36:10.535 --> 02:36:16.520
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on to another tweet here from Tiger Claw.

02:36:16.621 --> 02:36:16.921
[SPEAKER_11]: One more.

02:36:17.701 --> 02:36:22.286
[SPEAKER_11]: Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego is being turned into a live action film?

02:36:22.906 --> 02:36:23.727
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this trolling?

02:36:24.207 --> 02:36:28.191
[SPEAKER_11]: Because seriously, I clicked on this and Walden Media and...

02:36:31.638 --> 02:36:37.162
[SPEAKER_11]: Jennifer Lopez are teaming up to do Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

02:36:37.862 --> 02:36:39.343
[SPEAKER_11]: Please say this is a troll post.

02:36:40.764 --> 02:36:41.585
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you trolling us?

02:36:42.325 --> 02:36:43.846
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this trolling on Twitter, please?

02:36:45.447 --> 02:36:49.410
[SPEAKER_11]: Walden Media, they're the guys that did the Chronicles of Narnia, right?

02:36:49.710 --> 02:36:55.894
[SPEAKER_11]: Has acquired the rights to turn Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego into a live action film involving Jennifer Lopez.

02:36:56.975 --> 02:37:00.817
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I could see physically that kind of looks right, but...

02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:10.322
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be an interesting movie, but I wonder if they're going to make it just like a straight-up kids movie.

02:37:10.462 --> 02:37:11.803
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's where they would go with it.

02:37:12.623 --> 02:37:15.764
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, kind of like Inspector Gadget or something like that.

02:37:16.865 --> 02:37:17.225
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

02:37:17.665 --> 02:37:18.446
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I kind of think.

02:37:18.946 --> 02:37:20.387
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I will say this.

02:37:20.487 --> 02:37:24.408
[SPEAKER_11]: If it doesn't have this as the theme song, then I don't... Oops.

02:37:24.629 --> 02:37:26.730
[SPEAKER_11]: If it doesn't have this as the theme song, then it doesn't count.

02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:27.530
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah!

02:37:27.730 --> 02:37:28.070
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh!

02:37:40.057 --> 02:37:44.141
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you imagine Jennifer Lopez featuring Pitbull just ruining this fucking song?

02:37:50.855 --> 02:37:52.836
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:37:53.196 --> 02:37:55.197
[SPEAKER_11]: At a theater near you soon, apparently.

02:37:56.458 --> 02:37:56.778
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:37:57.399 --> 02:37:59.680
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, the phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:02.922
[SPEAKER_11]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

02:38:02.962 --> 02:38:03.922
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all the tweets, too.

02:38:03.962 --> 02:38:09.045
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me reload just in case things came through and we had the internet downtime that we were having.

02:38:10.306 --> 02:38:11.046
[SPEAKER_11]: Did we go down again?

02:38:12.261 --> 02:38:13.483
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is terrible.

02:38:13.724 --> 02:38:14.265
[SPEAKER_09]: What's terrible?

02:38:14.385 --> 02:38:19.955
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's... I looked up a little bit more information on that We're in the World's Carmen Sandiego thing.

02:38:20.296 --> 02:38:22.200
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the film's logline, they say.

02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:22.540
[SPEAKER_09]: It says...

02:38:23.168 --> 02:38:23.988
[SPEAKER_11]: What's a logline?

02:38:24.449 --> 02:38:26.089
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's like the pitch, basically.

02:38:26.429 --> 02:38:26.789
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

02:38:27.270 --> 02:38:37.974
[SPEAKER_09]: When the ACME agency's greatest detective, Carmen Sandiego, becomes the world's greatest thief, it's up to her former partner to follow her clues and track her down.

02:38:38.574 --> 02:38:42.496
[SPEAKER_09]: Their cat and mouse game leads the partner to confront a greater mystery.

02:38:42.956 --> 02:38:45.197
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Carmen really a thief or a hero?

02:38:47.078 --> 02:38:47.518
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, great.

02:38:47.558 --> 02:38:50.519
[SPEAKER_11]: So Carmen Sandiego may not end up even being a villainess.

02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:55.141
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

02:38:58.402 --> 02:39:04.604
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that is it for the tweets tonight.

02:39:04.724 --> 02:39:11.687
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to try re-logging into Skype because some folks are telling me that they can't see us on Skype and it might be because we went down while we were on.

02:39:14.788 --> 02:39:15.849
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay, internet issues.

02:39:16.189 --> 02:39:16.769
[SPEAKER_11]: Live radio.

02:39:17.089 --> 02:39:23.512
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any last minute stories or other stories we didn't get to in the show tonight that we can fill a little time with while I try to get the Skype line working?

02:39:24.965 --> 02:39:30.090
[SPEAKER_07]: I like pie and cake and ice cream and fire.

02:39:30.830 --> 02:39:31.371
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we're up.

02:39:31.391 --> 02:39:32.091
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting calls.

02:39:32.111 --> 02:39:32.512
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

02:39:32.552 --> 02:39:33.152
[SPEAKER_11]: It's finally working.

02:39:33.192 --> 02:39:34.173
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:39:34.193 --> 02:39:34.554
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

02:39:35.395 --> 02:39:36.075
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Shane.

02:39:36.175 --> 02:39:37.757
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Shane, a.k.a.

02:39:37.777 --> 02:39:38.517
[SPEAKER_11]: Miklatov, right?

02:39:39.258 --> 02:39:39.498
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

02:39:39.719 --> 02:39:40.059
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up?

02:39:41.112 --> 02:39:42.273
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing, just playing some WoW.

02:39:42.413 --> 02:39:44.615
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, I'm holding down shift and talking invent.

02:39:47.178 --> 02:39:48.539
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are you talking to invent?

02:39:48.999 --> 02:39:49.960
[SPEAKER_02]: Us talking to Todd.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:50.901
[SPEAKER_02]: We're playing a dungeon.

02:39:51.001 --> 02:39:51.421
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.

02:39:51.822 --> 02:39:53.884
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though you guys live in the same house and he's upstairs.

02:39:54.404 --> 02:39:57.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's upstairs, so it makes it so I don't have to yell.

02:39:57.467 --> 02:39:57.687
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

02:39:57.747 --> 02:39:58.287
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's fine.

02:39:59.288 --> 02:40:02.329
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anyway, what was I talking about?

02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:03.850
[SPEAKER_02]: Was I talking about anything yet?

02:40:03.870 --> 02:40:05.031
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't think I was.

02:40:05.051 --> 02:40:08.772
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you were talking about playing WoW and then calling into the show.

02:40:08.792 --> 02:40:09.693
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

02:40:09.793 --> 02:40:13.554
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm calling because you said I should call because of Sonic Generations.

02:40:14.014 --> 02:40:14.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

02:40:14.375 --> 02:40:15.315
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we actually own it.

02:40:15.615 --> 02:40:16.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Dooyah, how is it?

02:40:17.197 --> 02:40:25.067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty fantastic, and I want to add for a Sonic game after that, but it's actually just a pretty good game.

02:40:25.487 --> 02:40:29.773
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the Metacritic scores were kind of fairly good, I guess.

02:40:29.853 --> 02:40:32.256
[SPEAKER_11]: Not spectacular, but it's alright.

02:40:32.296 --> 02:40:32.756
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty good.

02:40:34.078 --> 02:40:41.105
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, with a 77%, I think you said it was, that is average.

02:40:41.245 --> 02:40:49.774
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be average, at least, if you go by a school grading scale, or it's well above average if you go by a regular grading scale.

02:40:49.814 --> 02:40:56.440
[SPEAKER_02]: But regardless, it's a nice throwback to classic Sonic in the way that Sonic 4 was, but a little bit better.

02:40:56.460 --> 02:40:56.881
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

02:40:59.042 --> 02:41:26.418
[SPEAKER_02]: and the best part about it to me is all the music because like say you're playing a Sonic Adventure level and you're playing as new Sonic and then you go and play as fat old Sonic it changes the music like one of them went to like a synth poppy song because obviously if you're playing on a Genesis you would not have that style CD quality music what's the whole twist with the new and old Sonic like I seriously don't know I have not been following this game

02:41:26.818 --> 02:41:35.302
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some evil force and it messes up time and you get thrown around.

02:41:35.602 --> 02:41:39.544
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I correct in thinking they yet again are cashing in on nostalgic Sonic?

02:41:40.225 --> 02:41:47.008
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, because from what I was watching Todd play, and it looks like the first three stages are from Sonic 1.

02:41:47.428 --> 02:41:49.189
[SPEAKER_02]: The next three are Sonic... Oh no, sorry.

02:41:49.429 --> 02:41:52.370
[SPEAKER_02]: The first three are Genesis era, so it's Sonic 1, 2, and 3.

02:41:53.151 --> 02:41:54.111
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like...

02:41:55.692 --> 02:41:56.393
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, dang it.

02:41:56.413 --> 02:41:58.734
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say the next is Dreamcast.

02:41:59.415 --> 02:42:03.017
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next ones after that are like the newer Sonic games.

02:42:03.157 --> 02:42:04.278
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a Mario Kart game.

02:42:05.839 --> 02:42:06.539
[SPEAKER_02]: A Mario Kart?

02:42:06.659 --> 02:42:08.420
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like they use old stuff?

02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:10.082
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, kind of.

02:42:11.322 --> 02:42:12.903
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, it's all about the music.

02:42:13.164 --> 02:42:22.810
[SPEAKER_02]: When I heard just random and to me awesome vocal songs from like the Sonic Dreamcast days, I got really excited.

02:42:22.830 --> 02:42:22.910
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:42:24.421 --> 02:42:25.441
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those songs are amazing.

02:42:25.461 --> 02:42:27.462
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's nostalgia that works for you then?

02:42:27.962 --> 02:42:32.823
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I'm not even a huge fan of Sonic in the least, but it is pretty neat.

02:42:33.203 --> 02:42:34.223
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well I'll have to check it out.

02:42:34.283 --> 02:42:35.623
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it still $60 though?

02:42:36.063 --> 02:42:37.024
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

02:42:37.064 --> 02:42:42.205
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, off and on, at work we had it for $39 for a few days.

02:42:42.465 --> 02:42:43.085
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not as bad.

02:42:44.405 --> 02:42:45.865
[SPEAKER_11]: Still, there's too many games to play right now.

02:42:46.045 --> 02:42:49.686
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got to play Arkham City is really good, and then I've got to play Skyrim.

02:42:50.586 --> 02:42:51.647
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played it, it's okay.

02:42:52.147 --> 02:42:53.007
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't like Arkham City?

02:42:53.067 --> 02:42:53.567
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong with you?

02:42:54.547 --> 02:42:56.228
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just Batman.

02:42:58.409 --> 02:43:00.069
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's goddamn Batman!

02:43:02.470 --> 02:43:02.750
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:43:03.391 --> 02:43:05.672
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to talk about that you're doing in the gaming world?

02:43:07.132 --> 02:43:10.574
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I already talked about the Old Republic stuff on Horde House.

02:43:10.674 --> 02:43:12.054
[SPEAKER_11]: Which everybody should listen to.

02:43:12.114 --> 02:43:13.075
[SPEAKER_11]: HordeHouse.com.

02:43:13.135 --> 02:43:14.315
[SPEAKER_11]: It's lulzy Warcraft.

02:43:14.355 --> 02:43:16.396
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if you don't like Warcraft, you get to hear dick and fart jokes.

02:43:17.148 --> 02:43:18.609
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's terrible.

02:43:18.890 --> 02:43:20.491
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

02:43:22.593 --> 02:43:27.678
[SPEAKER_02]: Uncharted 3 is getting, I guess, somewhat okay reviews.

02:43:27.738 --> 02:43:30.481
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like, oh my god, outstanding like the second one.

02:43:30.761 --> 02:43:30.961
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

02:43:30.981 --> 02:43:33.704
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I've played of it so far, I kind of agree.

02:43:34.124 --> 02:43:34.585
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.

02:43:34.725 --> 02:43:37.247
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes me sad because I am a huge Uncharted fan.

02:43:37.267 --> 02:43:37.567
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?

02:43:37.608 --> 02:43:42.272
[SPEAKER_02]: I even have an Uncharted 3 standee in my basement that I stole from work.

02:43:42.392 --> 02:43:44.594
[SPEAKER_11]: Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2

02:44:03.815 --> 02:44:09.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't want to give a lot of spoilers away, of course, because that's mean and I haven't beaten it yet.

02:44:10.322 --> 02:44:16.528
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I've played so far, which is probably about six hours, it feels like...

02:44:18.584 --> 02:44:46.557
[SPEAKER_02]: like okay the step from one to two in the series was drastic and amazing this one feels like they took all the good parts of two and then like the combat is a little bit better if not a little bit harder the graphics are better but the story just isn't quite there it seems to be everybody just saying you know hey Nathan Drake why do you chase treasure you're stupid and

02:44:47.137 --> 02:44:51.159
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so it's not, like, the story is not nearly as gripping as previously.

02:44:51.239 --> 02:44:52.459
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.

02:44:53.139 --> 02:44:58.481
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're using all these, and, you know, the stories aren't realistic in the least.

02:44:59.482 --> 02:45:10.386
[SPEAKER_02]: The first game had, like, Nazi zombie mutant things, and the second game had these Azteci big bulky guys that drank some liquid that made them super buff.

02:45:10.566 --> 02:45:10.766
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

02:45:10.946 --> 02:45:12.047
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one's using, like...

02:45:13.167 --> 02:45:15.509
[SPEAKER_02]: Like technology you would see in James Bond.

02:45:16.609 --> 02:45:18.430
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just isn't doing anything for me.

02:45:19.731 --> 02:45:20.091
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

02:45:20.692 --> 02:45:23.833
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of James Bond, didn't those GoldenEye remakes come out too this week?

02:45:24.134 --> 02:45:24.674
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did.

02:45:24.694 --> 02:45:25.935
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, busy week.

02:45:26.675 --> 02:45:30.157
[SPEAKER_02]: And the PS3 one has a move bundle that looks pretty nice.

02:45:31.158 --> 02:45:31.478
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

02:45:32.369 --> 02:45:34.230
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, Miklatov, I'm going to let you go.

02:45:34.250 --> 02:45:36.510
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any other thoughts for listeners before we get more calls?

02:45:37.271 --> 02:45:37.491
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope.

02:45:37.851 --> 02:45:38.071
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

02:45:38.771 --> 02:45:40.312
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, have fun on Vent doing quests.

02:45:40.852 --> 02:45:41.112
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

02:45:41.212 --> 02:45:41.752
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

02:45:41.852 --> 02:45:43.072
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

02:45:43.092 --> 02:45:47.394
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio if you would like to give us a call.

02:45:48.454 --> 02:45:55.980
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks in chat, chat.orangelandre.com, Actdeft, I think he's talking about the Sonic game in our chat room, says $30 on Steam.

02:45:56.061 --> 02:45:57.262
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not nearly as bad.

02:45:57.422 --> 02:45:58.963
[SPEAKER_11]: I can check.

02:45:59.183 --> 02:46:02.246
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wonder if during the holiday sale it'll be dirt cheap.

02:46:02.546 --> 02:46:03.286
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the thing with Steam games.

02:46:03.306 --> 02:46:04.427
[SPEAKER_07]: Dirt cheap during the holiday?

02:46:04.708 --> 02:46:05.188
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on it.

02:46:05.308 --> 02:46:05.849
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know.

02:46:05.909 --> 02:46:06.569
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, right?

02:46:06.969 --> 02:46:07.550
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where I'm at.

02:46:10.373 --> 02:46:22.030
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Loki, I don't know if you had a minute to look and see if there's anything last minute to talk about to help us fill time here because of our downtime They relaunched PlayStation Home Oh yeah, I forgot that was this week

02:46:23.066 --> 02:46:24.707
[SPEAKER_09]: and so it's all fantastic now I guess.

02:46:24.847 --> 02:46:25.287
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

02:46:25.407 --> 02:46:27.307
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't logged in.

02:46:27.368 --> 02:46:28.168
[SPEAKER_11]: What were they supposed to change?

02:46:28.188 --> 02:46:29.648
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard like questing and shit now?

02:46:29.948 --> 02:46:32.009
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like all completely redone.

02:46:32.049 --> 02:46:34.590
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean it looks like Disneyland almost the way they have it.

02:46:34.850 --> 02:46:37.911
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't say words that are going to make me want to download it immediately if it's not that.

02:46:38.091 --> 02:46:44.634
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it's segmented like a theme park so they've got different like sections like you know a midway type thing.

02:46:44.654 --> 02:46:46.694
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more of a sports center.

02:46:46.714 --> 02:46:48.275
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more of a Knott's Berry Farm.

02:46:49.215 --> 02:46:49.495
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:46:51.236 --> 02:46:51.496
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

02:46:53.586 --> 02:46:55.127
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's neat, I guess.

02:46:55.787 --> 02:47:01.711
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know the folks that did that wonderful King's Quest, The Silver Lining?

02:47:02.031 --> 02:47:03.431
[SPEAKER_09]: They're actually putting out an original game.

02:47:04.212 --> 02:47:05.593
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, I heard about that too.

02:47:05.613 --> 02:47:06.453
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds awesome.

02:47:06.813 --> 02:47:15.838
[SPEAKER_09]: Cognition, and it's basically an episodic detective adventure about an FBI agent who gains the power to see past events by touching any object.

02:47:18.490 --> 02:47:28.229
[SPEAKER_09]: and of course they have a Kickstarter up to fund it and they're looking for $25,000 and you get all sorts of sweet shit if you contribute to that.

02:47:32.340 --> 02:47:53.070
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's a rumor that Mega Man may be coming to Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 I guess there's a poster in the background of one of the levels that's inspired from an Uncanny X-Men cover And they have Mega Man on there That was from the Days of Future Past

02:47:57.979 --> 02:48:22.226
[SPEAKER_09]: and uh apparently uh you know it doesn't show Mega Man as deceased or apprehended so people think maybe download content something like that that'd be a real dick move but hey whatever you know they can make some extra money for via download content you know the moment they put them up for download that everyone's gonna get it it's gonna be instant money maker because everyone wants Mega Man and roll

02:48:24.667 --> 02:48:49.535
[SPEAKER_09]: and then um last but not least of course um you know we talked a little bit about Nintendo patents earlier and uh now Sony has actually patented biometric uh controllers for well obviously and also for the handhelds as well and not really sure what this would be used for but you know kind of think of like you know uh maybe some stuff that you know do with maybe uh

02:48:51.247 --> 02:49:00.750
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the stuff you saw with the Vitality Sensor or they have the Ubisoft Energy thing, basically reads your blood pressure, heart rate, and that kind of stuff.

02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:13.535
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe for exercise programs or something like that, they may have a special controller or attachment for like a move controller or something like that that would feed into that so you could see if you're exercising at the right level or whatever.

02:49:13.857 --> 02:49:15.398
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to jump in for live listeners.

02:49:15.498 --> 02:49:16.699
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like we're streaming again.

02:49:16.879 --> 02:49:19.040
[SPEAKER_11]: Once again, we had an internet outage, unfortunately.

02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:22.342
[SPEAKER_11]: I really appreciate you guys sticking with us through our downtime.

02:49:22.382 --> 02:49:23.543
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, this is out of our hands.

02:49:24.563 --> 02:49:26.524
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would we purposefully cut you guys off?

02:49:26.544 --> 02:49:27.385
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be ridiculous.

02:49:28.385 --> 02:49:29.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, trust me.

02:49:29.566 --> 02:49:32.247
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been dealing with this for the last three days, and it's a pain in the ass.

02:49:32.268 --> 02:49:33.788
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes playing MMOs not fun.

02:49:35.149 --> 02:49:36.650
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, we're doing our best through this.

02:49:36.730 --> 02:49:37.710
[SPEAKER_11]: We are getting another call, though.

02:49:37.730 --> 02:49:43.293
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess people can see that we're back up, even though I'm still waiting for the chat room to catch up and get us.

02:49:43.373 --> 02:49:44.373
[SPEAKER_11]: We are getting calls again.

02:49:44.433 --> 02:49:45.534
[SPEAKER_11]: So, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:49:45.554 --> 02:49:45.914
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

02:49:47.275 --> 02:49:49.556
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.

02:49:49.756 --> 02:49:51.116
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, how you doing, Actdeft?

02:49:51.156 --> 02:49:51.897
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good to hear from you.

02:49:53.277 --> 02:49:55.018
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm doing pretty fine, I guess.

02:49:55.759 --> 02:49:56.079
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up?

02:49:56.119 --> 02:49:56.579
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:03.042
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I want to talk about, well, say about Sonic Generations on PC.

02:50:04.029 --> 02:50:06.970
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it, but it's cheaper on Steam.

02:50:07.190 --> 02:50:12.972
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and we mentioned that on the show, but of course you guys didn't hear it because of our downtime.

02:50:13.352 --> 02:50:16.113
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it sounds like it's a more reasonable price on Steam, right?

02:50:19.514 --> 02:50:20.434
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you still there, Actdeft?

02:50:21.915 --> 02:50:22.495
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm here.

02:50:22.675 --> 02:50:22.875
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

02:50:23.195 --> 02:50:25.276
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like it's a more reasonable price on Steam then, right?

02:50:26.596 --> 02:50:28.917
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like $30.

02:50:29.577 --> 02:50:30.397
[SPEAKER_04]: So did you buy it?

02:50:32.058 --> 02:50:32.198
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:50:32.862 --> 02:50:35.343
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, what do you think of Sonic Generations?

02:50:36.543 --> 02:50:45.866
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I haven't played it, but many people have talked pretty good about it, so I may get it if it's cheaper on Steam's holiday sale.

02:50:48.166 --> 02:50:54.148
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of where I'm at, is that if it's on Steam, then I'm just going to wait for the Uber sale that comes later on and get it then.

02:50:56.508 --> 02:50:57.069
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

02:50:58.029 --> 02:50:59.269
[SPEAKER_11]: What else have you been playing lately?

02:50:59.609 --> 02:51:02.070
[SPEAKER_11]: What have you been playing if you haven't been playing Sonic Generations?

02:51:03.812 --> 02:51:05.032
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been playing Bastion.

02:51:06.332 --> 02:51:07.773
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Bastion's cool.

02:51:07.873 --> 02:51:10.213
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you been playing that on the PC or 360 or what?

02:51:11.133 --> 02:51:11.833
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, PC.

02:51:12.493 --> 02:51:16.834
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now my 360's broken so I can't play on it.

02:51:18.314 --> 02:51:24.736
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember they were having a $5 sale on Bastion or something like that this week on Steam.

02:51:24.756 --> 02:51:25.136
[SPEAKER_04]: $7, I think.

02:51:25.696 --> 02:51:27.616
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it as a birthday gift.

02:51:28.256 --> 02:51:28.996
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, very cool.

02:51:29.276 --> 02:51:30.176
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think of Bastion?

02:51:31.737 --> 02:51:33.077
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it a lot, but

02:51:34.024 --> 02:51:35.825
[SPEAKER_04]: I have played, it's pretty good.

02:51:36.125 --> 02:51:37.186
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty addicting.

02:51:38.487 --> 02:51:42.769
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me of old school Zelda or old school adventure RPGs.

02:51:44.250 --> 02:51:50.394
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think about that narrator that's in the game that has to talk about everything as you're playing through it?

02:51:51.334 --> 02:51:52.815
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I liked it.

02:51:52.895 --> 02:51:54.216
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty nice addition.

02:51:54.296 --> 02:52:01.840
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes you feel like you're playing it with someone and it's telling you the story like

02:52:02.769 --> 02:52:03.369
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

02:52:03.870 --> 02:52:07.411
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if anyone hates it or doesn't like it.

02:52:07.732 --> 02:52:07.852
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:52:07.892 --> 02:52:08.032
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:52:26.260 --> 02:52:26.840
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

02:52:27.321 --> 02:52:29.522
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be pretty bland, I think.

02:52:29.642 --> 02:52:34.885
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the narrator adds something to it that makes it more appealing.

02:52:35.025 --> 02:52:37.207
[SPEAKER_11]: The soundtrack to that game is great, too.

02:52:38.607 --> 02:52:40.749
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I may feature it in the future.

02:52:40.789 --> 02:52:41.909
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that song segment.

02:52:42.190 --> 02:52:42.630
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

02:52:42.690 --> 02:52:43.270
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there you go.

02:52:43.330 --> 02:52:43.951
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that idea.

02:52:44.531 --> 02:52:45.472
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I've got to play this for you.

02:52:45.492 --> 02:52:47.913
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a parody that was making its way around the internet this week.

02:52:47.933 --> 02:52:55.658
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you guys saw this, but this is the Bastion narrator – well, it's not really him, but somebody impersonating him – doing his take on other video games.

02:52:56.462 --> 02:52:56.802
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

02:53:26.301 --> 02:53:28.782
[SPEAKER_11]: And what's funny is that that's like really what playing the game is like.

02:53:29.782 --> 02:53:30.102
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:53:31.303 --> 02:53:32.223
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a pretty good parody.

02:53:32.263 --> 02:53:32.703
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.

02:53:32.743 --> 02:53:33.084
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

02:53:34.444 --> 02:53:35.404
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll watch it later.

02:53:36.285 --> 02:53:37.945
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really funny.

02:53:38.105 --> 02:53:39.486
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on this website called Dorkly.

02:53:39.546 --> 02:53:40.847
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they're just hosting the video.

02:53:40.907 --> 02:53:41.727
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're awesome.

02:53:41.747 --> 02:53:43.447
[SPEAKER_09]: They put out a bunch of weird stuff like that.

02:53:44.148 --> 02:53:44.388
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

02:53:45.688 --> 02:53:46.209
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

02:53:46.229 --> 02:53:48.489
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Actdeft, anything else you want to share on the show before we let you go?

02:53:49.970 --> 02:53:54.572
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably a question for Loki about 360s right now.

02:53:55.112 --> 02:53:55.412
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:53:55.871 --> 02:53:56.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

02:54:00.152 --> 02:54:03.813
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there going to be any special or price deduction for the 360?

02:54:03.873 --> 02:54:05.173
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get one for Christmas.

02:54:06.013 --> 02:54:10.154
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if it's going to still be $200 or it's going to get cheaper.

02:54:10.494 --> 02:54:14.115
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to announce any price drops.

02:54:14.916 --> 02:54:24.498
[SPEAKER_09]: If anything, they just have the holiday bundles right now, which for like a 250 gigabyte system, I think they've got Fable 3 and Halo Reach in there.

02:54:25.758 --> 02:54:29.900
[SPEAKER_11]: You will see some cutthroat deals going on Black Friday as well.

02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:33.461
[SPEAKER_11]: We're already hearing about retailers that are probably going to offer the system.

02:54:33.781 --> 02:54:39.123
[SPEAKER_11]: And it won't be a price reduction so much, but that you'll get a free $50 or even $100 gift card when you buy the system.

02:54:39.143 --> 02:54:41.404
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't remember what retailer was rumored to be doing that.

02:54:41.424 --> 02:54:41.985
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it Toys R Us?

02:54:48.067 --> 02:54:49.587
[SPEAKER_09]: Toys R Us or Target.

02:54:50.468 --> 02:54:59.730
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep an eye out for those Black Friday ads because you're probably not going to see a price reduction on the system itself, but you'll see these other little deals to try and get you to go buy the system there.

02:55:00.271 --> 02:55:04.512
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you're talking $100 gift card, that could be a pretty big thing.

02:55:04.532 --> 02:55:12.354
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, I know you're in Mexico, but you come up to California to take advantage of some of those sales sometimes, right?

02:55:12.374 --> 02:55:12.514
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:17.671
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sometimes though I get my bonus until December, so...

02:55:19.265 --> 02:55:22.487
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't be able to take advantage of that

02:55:47.319 --> 02:55:47.840
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think so.

02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:49.422
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that there's at least a pre-

02:56:00.899 --> 02:56:05.142
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.

02:56:05.322 --> 02:56:12.568
[SPEAKER_11]: AGN409 in our chatroom says keep a look on at slickdeals.net Suggest that too.

02:56:13.869 --> 02:56:15.650
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we might be losing the internet again.

02:56:16.051 --> 02:56:16.391
[SPEAKER_11]: We are.

02:56:17.191 --> 02:56:19.853
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, that brings the Actdeft call to a close.

02:56:19.994 --> 02:56:22.716
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, I don't know if you can hear us, but thank you so much for your call.

02:56:22.756 --> 02:56:23.716
[SPEAKER_11]: We really appreciate it.

02:56:26.378 --> 02:56:26.718
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that it?

02:56:26.738 --> 02:56:27.959
[SPEAKER_11]: Did the internet go down completely again?

02:56:27.979 --> 02:56:28.379
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it did.

02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:29.960
[SPEAKER_11]: We lost the show again.

02:56:30.621 --> 02:56:31.001
[SPEAKER_11]: Again?

02:56:31.521 --> 02:56:32.021
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

02:56:32.542 --> 02:56:33.282
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not your fault.

02:56:33.302 --> 02:56:34.263
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just Comcast.

02:56:34.423 --> 02:56:36.364
[SPEAKER_11]: It's frustrating, but I know it's not your fault.

02:56:36.384 --> 02:56:37.785
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because of the rain.

02:56:37.825 --> 02:56:38.705
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it really?

02:56:38.906 --> 02:56:40.106
[SPEAKER_07]: It does this every year, you know.

02:56:40.787 --> 02:56:43.648
[SPEAKER_07]: Right when the rainy season starts and it gets cold.

02:56:43.728 --> 02:56:46.490
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets cloudy and the cable's like, ah, clouds!

02:56:47.270 --> 02:56:51.453
[SPEAKER_07]: It just seems to do this when it starts getting hot and when it starts getting cold.

02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:53.541
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I love my mommy!

02:57:19.565 --> 02:57:22.286
[SPEAKER_09]: and then also apparently Gearbox being awesome.

02:57:22.846 --> 02:57:43.131
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a guy that was a Borderlands fan who died of cancer at the age of 22 and so Gearbox actually did a eulogy as Claptrap and also this kid will be featured in the next Borderlands game as an NPC which is kind of cool.

02:57:45.336 --> 02:57:46.357
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's a nice gesture.

02:57:46.757 --> 02:57:46.917
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:57:46.937 --> 02:57:55.922
[SPEAKER_11]: That's always really nice to see the companies do that for, you know, people when they die that were important, especially if it was really before their time.

02:57:56.982 --> 02:58:00.264
[SPEAKER_11]: So, well, I guess, is that it for Last Minute Stories?

02:58:01.304 --> 02:58:02.505
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

02:58:02.785 --> 02:58:03.145
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:58:03.385 --> 02:58:03.926
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunate.

02:58:04.326 --> 02:58:07.307
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, unfortunately, we're missing a Skype line right now.

02:58:07.968 --> 02:58:11.850
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel really bad, especially for those guys that tune up live, but again, out of our control.

02:58:12.475 --> 02:58:17.498
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap things up.

02:58:17.638 --> 02:58:19.740
[SPEAKER_11]: So I will say this.

02:58:19.780 --> 02:58:20.781
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll start with this, of course.

02:58:20.921 --> 02:58:24.183
[SPEAKER_11]: Once again, guys, thanks for tuning into our show and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:24.283 --> 02:58:28.105
[SPEAKER_11]: Even when we're having crazy internet downtime and so forth, we really appreciate it.

02:58:28.186 --> 02:58:29.066
[SPEAKER_11]: It means a lot to us.

02:58:29.626 --> 02:58:31.848
[SPEAKER_11]: If you like what you hear, all we ask, tell a friend about the show.

02:58:31.908 --> 02:58:41.054
[SPEAKER_11]: Word of mouth is so important, and we just want to build our community and grow stronger and maybe find some people that work for the cable company who can make sure our internet connection stays up.

02:58:41.194 --> 02:58:41.454
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

02:58:43.356 --> 02:58:45.497
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.

02:58:45.757 --> 02:58:47.858
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts tonight?

02:58:48.158 --> 02:58:49.639
[SPEAKER_07]: We go to print this week.

02:58:50.459 --> 02:58:54.762
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a seven-page research paper due this week.

02:58:56.783 --> 02:59:01.345
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week, I will probably not cry so much.

02:59:01.646 --> 02:59:02.626
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm about ready to go.

02:59:04.647 --> 02:59:05.768
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, do you have a final thought tonight?

02:59:06.608 --> 02:59:09.090
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be playing Saints Row the Third this week.

02:59:09.190 --> 02:59:09.670
[SPEAKER_09]: At some point.

02:59:11.175 --> 02:59:11.917
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my goal at least.

02:59:12.058 --> 02:59:13.120
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully sooner rather than later.

02:59:13.161 --> 02:59:16.409
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, I'll play Saints Row 2 on PC.

02:59:17.134 --> 02:59:28.921
[SPEAKER_11]: And my final thought tonight is, well, A, I'm really bummed about the internet going down, but I guess the one silver lining about it is that that means we're going to finish up early, just in time for Pinkberry.

02:59:28.981 --> 02:59:30.762
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, let's go.

02:59:31.243 --> 02:59:33.484
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:33.764 --> 02:59:35.825
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our show.

02:59:35.845 --> 02:59:36.506
[SPEAKER_11]: We really appreciate it.

02:59:36.526 --> 02:59:37.326
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just came back up.

02:59:37.627 --> 02:59:38.327
[SPEAKER_11]: Did it just come back up?

02:59:38.347 --> 02:59:39.007
[SPEAKER_11]: It just came back up.

02:59:39.127 --> 02:59:41.429
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it'll come back up in time for folks to hear the credits.

02:59:41.869 --> 02:59:43.069
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a wonderful night, everybody.

02:59:43.089 --> 02:59:46.450
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you next week, hopefully with less internet lulls.

02:59:46.750 --> 02:59:47.430
[SPEAKER_11]: Good night, everyone.

03:00:04.534 --> 03:00:05.195
[SPEAKER_08]: or allgames.com.

03:00:05.255 --> 03:00:06.475
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're probably right anyway.

03:00:06.495 --> 03:00:07.036
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next week!
