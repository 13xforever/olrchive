00:00.000 --> 00:19.520
Tonight, November 6th, 2011, a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto is unveiled, a major

00:19.520 --> 00:29.760
MMO goes free to play, and what is in store for the Wii next after Skyward Sword?

00:29.760 --> 00:34.880
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.880 --> 00:38.520
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.520 --> 00:47.280
We are live tonight, November the 6th of 2011, with the 434th show of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.500
We were off last week, but we're back tonight to join you over the next few hours live to

00:51.500 --> 00:55.760
talk about video games and gaming culture and have some lols, hopefully.

00:55.760 --> 00:58.700
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you with my co-hosts.

00:58.700 --> 01:02.000
Say hello over there to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Hi.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
How are you?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.560
I'm tired, Rob.

01:05.560 --> 01:09.360
It's been especially a little while since we've heard from you, because we were unexpectedly

01:09.360 --> 01:13.280
sort of off last week, I mean, that all came up at the last minute, but you had been gone

01:13.280 --> 01:14.960
the week before because you were at Disneyland.

01:14.960 --> 01:15.960
Yes.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.840
Or as I was saying on the show, you were at Blizzcon a little too late.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.520
I was actually, I met some Blizzcon people that were staying at our hotel.

01:22.520 --> 01:23.520
Nice.

01:23.520 --> 01:24.520
And they were calling it DizCon.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard that term before.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.880
I've wanted to go, here's my thing with Blizzcon, as much as I love the Blizzard products, I'm

01:30.880 --> 01:37.080
sorry, I'm not paying $150 to go to your publicly open press conference and play your demos,

01:37.080 --> 01:42.520
like I don't get, does not compute function, but I will totally go to go to all the hotel

01:42.520 --> 01:46.400
parties because there's some sweet parties that get thrown, and then like DizCon, I'll

01:46.400 --> 01:50.040
go for that, because like, shit, I go to Disneyland all the time anyway.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.720
If you listen to the show any length of time, you know that.

01:51.720 --> 01:56.360
I just kept running in though to other WoW players, and so I'd go talk to them, and Dan

01:56.360 --> 02:00.520
would just roll his eyes and go somewhere else, because he pretty much hates it.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.520
The WoWs.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.520
He hates the WoWs.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.520
All right.

02:03.520 --> 02:07.280
And I've got a new obsession too, which is the WoW model viewer.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.000
Well, we'll talk about that in a little bit.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.200
I've got to introduce, he doesn't play WoW, so if you're worried about this becoming the

02:12.200 --> 02:15.500
Warcraft show, don't worry, we've got tons of other games tonight, Techmaster Loki's

02:15.500 --> 02:16.500
in the house.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.500
No, I don't play WoW.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.500
To not talk about WoW.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.500
I do not play WoW.

02:19.500 --> 02:24.080
But he will talk about food, but we were a little concerned because you didn't bring,

02:24.080 --> 02:27.420
like if you've listened to the show for any length of time, Loki always brings food with

02:27.420 --> 02:30.180
him to the show from a random fast food place, but not tonight.

02:30.180 --> 02:32.360
And I was like, are you feeling okay, Loki?

02:32.360 --> 02:33.360
He brought with him a Red Bull.

02:33.360 --> 02:37.520
Should have been two Red Bulls, because that Red Bull one, it's just not enough by itself.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.200
Was the kid keeping you up last night?

02:39.200 --> 02:41.400
No, it's just like drinking your Red Bulls.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.560
Oh, I thought you needed energy.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.560
Well, no.

02:45.560 --> 02:51.960
It seriously allows me to concentrate and get more work done at work without being distracted

02:51.960 --> 02:52.960
as much.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.000
Because productivity gets way higher with Red Bull.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.520
Now, hold on, or they're gonna have to start paying you to say that here on the show, so.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.880
Well, they wanna pay me in like a big tub of Red Bull.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.720
Get that little car to drive around and come give you some.

03:04.720 --> 03:08.000
But Dark Sakura fed you some of her, I guess, extra dinner or whatever.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
I don't know.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.640
Were you just cooking for the fun of it?

03:10.640 --> 03:14.800
I wanted beef stew because it's gotten cold outside.

03:14.800 --> 03:21.500
And I had broth, you know, stuff to make broth out of, so I just made, I made a vegetable

03:21.500 --> 03:24.960
broth in the crock pot overnight, and then I made the beef stew in the morning.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.320
And crock pot cooking is in right now.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.440
Like I notice a lot of people are like really into it.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.880
It never went out.

03:30.880 --> 03:31.880
It's easy.

03:31.880 --> 03:32.880
I don't know why.

03:32.880 --> 03:33.880
Like it just seems like I'm noticing it more.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.640
The Paula Deen recipe for pot roast is amazing.

03:36.640 --> 03:37.640
And I'm not just talking about-

03:37.640 --> 03:38.640
How much butter?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.520
There's not a lot of butter, but there's a lot of sodium.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.800
A lot of sodium.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.440
I see them more prevalent at Target.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.080
I see it mentioned more on blogs, on Facebook.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.080
I don't know.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.080
Maybe it's the economy.

03:50.080 --> 03:54.400
Well, honestly, it makes perfect sense because you can make a lot of food to last you for

03:54.400 --> 03:56.800
a week in the crock pot.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.960
You know, you can have it cook while you're at work or whatever, and you come home and

04:00.960 --> 04:01.960
it's hot dinner.

04:01.960 --> 04:07.320
It's like having your own, you know, servant, except you did all the work, but you didn't

04:07.320 --> 04:08.320
cook it.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.320
And you forgot that you did all the work.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.320
It was cooked.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.600
You come home and it's cooked, and it's good.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.600
All right.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.400
Well, believe it or not, we talk about more than food here on Orange Lounge Radio.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.120
If it's your first time listening to the show, I'll just kind of reintroduce the show here

04:19.120 --> 04:20.980
real quick because it's been a while.

04:20.980 --> 04:26.800
We are three friends that all met about 10 years ago at this point, all playing a popular

04:26.800 --> 04:30.160
video game at the arcades called Dance Dance Revolution.

04:30.160 --> 04:33.040
And we used to go to these marathon sessions of playing that at the arcade, and we would

04:33.040 --> 04:36.400
go to dinner afterwards with other friends, and we just sat around and talked shit about

04:36.400 --> 04:41.480
video games, whether it be DDR or whatever else is at the arcade, for hours and hours

04:41.480 --> 04:42.480
afterwards.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.860
And I had been dabbling in internet radio, so at Dark Sakura before that.

04:46.860 --> 04:50.900
And so we decided to kind of take that into an internet radio show, and Loki joined us

04:50.900 --> 04:51.900
along the way.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.700
And that's where Orange Lounge Radio was born.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.880
We pride ourselves on the fact that we interact.

04:55.880 --> 04:56.880
We do the show live.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.180
We always have.

04:58.180 --> 04:59.320
Very rare, we're not live.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.660
Usually it has to be a computer issue or something.

05:01.660 --> 05:09.920
But out of the 434 episodes we'd have, I'd say about 430 of those are probably live,

05:09.920 --> 05:12.080
and interacting with you guys in our chat room.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.280
We have you guys in chat giving live commentary on the show.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.440
So you guys can call us later in the show.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.880
We like to embrace new social media as it comes out.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.200
So Facebook, we're on there.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.200
Twitter, we're on there.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.200
We give it a big kiss.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.320
That's why we call it the show where every gamer has a voice.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.660
Because, you know, we're not paid.

05:27.660 --> 05:31.920
Very rarely are we sent advance review copies of things, or get free perks for this, because

05:31.920 --> 05:33.740
we've always been very independent.

05:33.740 --> 05:36.680
So we like to think we're giving you just a truly honest perspective.

05:36.680 --> 05:40.000
And sometimes that honest perspective is, I don't have time this week to play every

05:40.000 --> 05:41.440
single freaking game that's out right now.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.640
I will say people do want to send us advance copies, we'll be happy to accept them.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.640
Exactly.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.640
Exactly.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.640
I will never say no to that.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.040
I don't care what it is.

05:49.040 --> 05:54.080
But I will say this, is that the holiday season is upon us now, and that's kind of what I

05:54.080 --> 05:57.600
wanted to move into, is the holiday season is upon us now, and we're in that month every

05:57.600 --> 06:00.580
year in video games where everything is coming out.

06:00.580 --> 06:03.920
And I just, I know you guys have got to be feeling this too.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.520
I really don't have time to play everything.

06:06.520 --> 06:10.040
And like I am a Warcraft player, as we were talking about at the beginning of the show,

06:10.040 --> 06:13.380
and as if that didn't need enough time, like now there's all these other games out I'm

06:13.380 --> 06:17.080
trying to play, and there's just not enough time.

06:17.080 --> 06:22.000
And Skyrim is out on Friday, and I'm just thinking like, oh god, that's going to be

06:22.000 --> 06:29.040
another suck in my time away, and I'm hearing it's great, which I was expecting, so yay,

06:29.040 --> 06:30.520
I don't have enough time to play everything.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.120
What games are you guys looking forward to this holiday season, if anything?

06:34.120 --> 06:36.280
Dark Sakura, is there anything, maybe it's already out?

06:36.280 --> 06:38.480
I'm looking forward to sleeping.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.440
I'm looking forward to the semester being over, so I can actually play the shit I have.

06:42.440 --> 06:47.880
Honestly, because, I mean, I started playing Symphony of the Night again, and I've just

06:47.880 --> 06:52.400
been too tired to really play anything other than, you know, WoW and the other couple things

06:52.400 --> 06:53.800
I'm playing.

06:53.800 --> 06:59.720
It's honestly, if it comes out and it falls into my lap, I'll be happy to play it.

06:59.720 --> 07:06.560
If it comes out and it's something that I want, I'll find a way to make it happen, but

07:06.560 --> 07:11.900
right now, I'm just not really doing the looking forward to anything kind of deal, I'm doing

07:11.900 --> 07:16.440
the get me through the next three weeks, we go to print next week.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.440
This week, we go to print, fuck me, we go to print this week.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.440
Oh my god.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.440
IRL stuff.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.040
Um, Loki, what are you looking forward to this holiday?

07:25.040 --> 07:28.440
Like I had to ask, like I had to ask, and that's Tuesday, right?

07:28.440 --> 07:29.440
Next Tuesday.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.440
Oh, next Tuesday.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.760
Do you have any special events lined up, like did you take Wednesday off work?

07:33.760 --> 07:35.920
Do you have anything planned special?

07:35.920 --> 07:37.720
No, I'm just gonna play it.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.920
Nope, just gonna play it.

07:39.920 --> 07:40.920
Just gonna play it.

07:40.920 --> 07:45.240
Going to our chat room for some comments, chat.orangeslantrady.com, talking about the

07:45.240 --> 07:47.160
free games that we don't get.

07:47.160 --> 07:53.960
Dark Tetsuya says, Loki, would you play anything even if it's Skylanders 2?

07:53.960 --> 07:54.960
Going back to what you said.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.360
If you're gonna send me a free copy of that, I'll do something creative with those toys.

07:58.360 --> 08:02.200
You know what, looking at Twitter, and kind of getting the feel for what people are saying,

08:02.200 --> 08:07.120
I'm seeing a lot of positive stuff about it, especially from the people that have kids.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.520
Really seem to enjoy, like Skylanders is a fun game to play with kids.

08:09.520 --> 08:13.400
Glad that they were able to lower their standards for their kids.

08:13.400 --> 08:19.500
Because you know, kids, they're definitely not attached to stupid toys nowadays, and

08:19.500 --> 08:24.240
trust me, Activision is getting behind publishing games that are on the DS for a lot of those

08:24.240 --> 08:28.600
stupid toys that you're just like, I don't understand why these kids like that.

08:28.600 --> 08:34.600
But you know what, that's fine, and I understand, I'm not trying to sound like the bitter old

08:34.600 --> 08:39.120
man or whatever that's like, oh, I don't understand these kids, I don't understand

08:39.120 --> 08:44.200
these kids' games and their toys and blah blah blah, no seriously, their toys are stupid

08:44.200 --> 08:46.080
compared to the stuff that we used to have.

08:46.080 --> 08:51.280
I mean, our toys used to do stuff, I mean, it may have been stupid things like, you know,

08:51.280 --> 08:55.080
karate chopping arm and stuff, but you know what, Teddy Ruxpin was the fucking future,

08:55.080 --> 08:56.080
he could read anything.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.880
I have a Teddy Ruxpin.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.920
I know you do.

08:59.920 --> 09:00.920
And Grubby.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.000
And most of the...

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
My buddy.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.480
Wherever you go, he goes.

09:07.480 --> 09:13.520
I had one of those things, and man, his face is definitely hard, and you can do some serious

09:13.520 --> 09:16.520
injuries to other people with that stuff.

09:16.520 --> 09:24.880
No, but, I'm just saying, okay, Skylanders, you gotta, yeah, I understand your kids are

09:24.880 --> 09:30.160
gonna have fun with that game, because it's like, oh look, the toys come to life, and

09:30.160 --> 09:34.600
it's so much fun, but seriously, you as a responsible parent need to understand that

09:34.600 --> 09:39.960
it's just a ploy to get you to buy the toys and this really expensive game that you don't

09:39.960 --> 09:40.960
need.

09:40.960 --> 09:45.640
Hell, you know what, buy your kids a good game, and buy them some other toys that are

09:45.640 --> 09:46.640
also very good.

09:46.640 --> 09:51.600
I just wanna say, for those that didn't have the privilege of growing up when, you know,

09:51.600 --> 09:56.000
these old people here on this program grew up, just let me take you back a few years

09:56.000 --> 09:58.720
here as to what we were into at the time.

09:58.720 --> 09:59.720
Here you go.

09:59.720 --> 10:21.240
Now, it wasn't necessarily into My Buddy, but my parents bought it for me.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.240
It's just a giant fucking doll, okay, I mean, that's all it is.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.240
It's just like...

10:25.240 --> 10:27.960
Kid's sister's at a tea party, though.

10:27.960 --> 10:33.600
I mean, it was just seriously, I mean, it could have been just a Cabbage Patch doll,

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
but...

10:34.600 --> 10:35.840
That's probably what it was trying to capitalize on.

10:35.840 --> 10:36.840
Seriously.

10:36.840 --> 10:37.840
I had Cabbage Patch Kids.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.480
Sorry for the poor audio on that, YouTube doesn't balance our ideas.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.480
And I'm not saying that that toy was good.

10:42.480 --> 10:46.720
That toy was not good at all, yeah, I recognize that it was, and yeah, Teddy Ruxpin was kind

10:46.720 --> 10:52.160
of an interesting toy because that, you know, had, you know, it was a thing that played

10:52.160 --> 10:55.000
tapes, you know, cassette tapes.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.040
I know some kids that are maybe even listening to the show don't know what that is, but cassette

10:59.040 --> 11:07.360
tapes, and they would actually move their mouth to the stuff, you know, the actual audio

11:07.360 --> 11:11.460
because I think they had it split or something like that, and that's how it worked.

11:11.460 --> 11:15.560
And it would read stories to you, and interact, they had the little playsets and stuff like

11:15.560 --> 11:16.560
that.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.600
And those are kind of cool, I mean, because at the time it was like pretty cutting edge

11:19.600 --> 11:20.600
stuff.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
But...

11:21.600 --> 11:26.880
I'm sorry, I love this comment in our chat room, AlphaKananagram says, I had a My Buddy,

11:26.880 --> 11:30.680
but then I saw a movie or clips of a Chucky movie and stopped playing with it.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.080
Oh my god, you know what?

11:32.080 --> 11:34.360
Can't say I blame you there.

11:34.360 --> 11:39.760
Yesterday, and okay, I'm on the American River Review staff, and we sometimes go in on Saturdays

11:39.760 --> 11:41.480
and Sundays to do extra work.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.640
So we play movies.

11:43.640 --> 11:53.200
And yesterday we were watching an MST3K movie that was called The Devil Doll, about this

11:53.200 --> 11:58.200
mannequin and we just kept singing the My Buddy theme over and over every time the mannequin

11:58.200 --> 12:00.480
would show up on the screen.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.080
It's been so long since we've done a show, I didn't talk about the haunted house that

12:03.080 --> 12:04.280
I went to a couple weeks ago.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.280
Oh, talk about it.

12:05.280 --> 12:09.360
Oh my god, okay, so we went to one of those cheesy haunted house things that they take

12:09.360 --> 12:13.720
the old store that like one of the circuit cities that closed down, that they haven't

12:13.720 --> 12:16.400
been able to get something else in there and they turned it into like this Uber haunted

12:16.400 --> 12:17.400
house.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.400
Right.

12:18.400 --> 12:22.240
And one of the scarier ones that we went into, and I usually, usually like, you know, I kind

12:22.240 --> 12:26.600
of approach this stuff with a haha, this stuff's derpy and dorky or whatever, but these guys

12:26.600 --> 12:27.600
did a really good job.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.820
And I can't remember the name of the haunted house, but it was out for the local folks

12:30.820 --> 12:34.360
to Sacramento, California, it was out in Roseville, right across from the Dave and Busters out

12:34.360 --> 12:35.360
there.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.140
Like, I don't know what some furniture store used to be over there and they turned it into

12:37.140 --> 12:38.480
a haunted house.

12:38.480 --> 12:45.880
And they had one that was all Halloween themed or it was all Halloween themed stupid.

12:45.880 --> 12:50.200
They had one that was all Hollywood themed and they had like all the recreations of the

12:50.200 --> 12:51.320
different movies.

12:51.320 --> 12:55.320
And like one of the rooms had a Chucky doll and like, it was really like scary and good

12:55.320 --> 12:56.320
life.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.320
And then it started moving.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.200
They had a freaking midget as the Chucky doll.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.200
That's awesome.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
It started following you around.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.600
It was like freaky and like, yeah, they were really good at scaring people because they

13:05.600 --> 13:08.440
had, and this, this was the only way, like some people would do it.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.080
They had a rule like a strip club.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.080
We don't touch you.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.080
You don't touch us.

13:13.080 --> 13:17.840
Like there was a no touching rule, but they will get right up in your face and all this

13:17.840 --> 13:18.840
stuff.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.680
They had a Freddy Krueger that had like sparks coming out.

13:20.680 --> 13:21.680
I mean, it was awesome.

13:21.680 --> 13:25.400
It was really well done, but the Chucky doll, just the whole talk about that made me think

13:25.400 --> 13:26.400
of this.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.400
I will say this though.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.480
They had all these different themed areas.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.360
One of them was a hospital theme.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.680
It was just like silent Hill and clearly had its inspiration.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.920
I would have wanted to see that.

13:34.920 --> 13:35.920
Oh my gosh.

13:35.920 --> 13:36.920
Are there nurses?

13:36.920 --> 13:38.400
Oh, well they didn't like have.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.400
People in the silent Hill costume.

13:40.400 --> 13:45.160
Like I don't, they didn't, but being in there definitely felt like it had the huge inspiration

13:45.160 --> 13:46.160
from silent Hill.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.160
Actually.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.160
They did have some real cut up nurses.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.360
They just didn't have like the face, like the face is wrapped in gauze type of thing.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.360
They didn't really have that.

13:52.360 --> 13:56.160
Well, that was only in, um, the movie that they had the face wrapped in gauze.

13:56.160 --> 14:00.040
They had that in, um, they were faceless in a couple of the others and then just had

14:00.040 --> 14:01.960
these kinds of modeled faces.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.600
Don't, don't test me on my silent Hill.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.040
I'm not, I'm not.

14:06.040 --> 14:10.640
So one of the other things that truly scared me was the dentist in there cause like, you

14:10.640 --> 14:16.920
know, the dentist is scary and had an air gun that you didn't know he had until it's

14:16.920 --> 14:20.440
just the right person, which happened to be me walk by and you have the drilling noises

14:20.440 --> 14:26.160
and all of a sudden, and I was like, that was exactly the sound you made.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.160
Yeah.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.600
You know, that's what happens when like 10 gay guys in their hag, I'll go to a haunted

14:30.600 --> 14:31.600
house together.

14:31.600 --> 14:36.080
You know, it's going back to the toys and you know, buying your kids, Skylanders and

14:36.080 --> 14:37.080
stuff like that.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.080
Okay.

14:38.080 --> 14:43.920
Would you rather, you know, spend $200 on Skylanders and their, their toys or buy them

14:43.920 --> 14:50.520
like, I mean $200 you can buy a really nice, you know, toy or something or a lot of toys

14:50.520 --> 14:55.240
for $200 and I can guarantee they'll probably have a lot more fun than they do with Skylanders.

14:55.240 --> 15:00.280
Yeah, that's a neat concept, but yeah, I mean, come on.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.520
You can buy a cheap arcade cabinet for that.

15:02.520 --> 15:06.360
One of my friends is building an arcade cabinet and it made me think of you actually.

15:06.360 --> 15:10.320
I'm seeing all the pictures on Facebook and everything and it just totally, it totally

15:10.320 --> 15:14.360
reminded me of when we lived together and you built that arcade cabinet that the TV

15:14.360 --> 15:15.360
was in.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.360
Yeah, it was a mistake.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.640
Oh man, those were the days.

15:17.640 --> 15:24.080
So since we're talking about cool toys that you could spend like $200 on, uh, did they

15:24.080 --> 15:29.320
have this or do they have this now that they had when I was a kid?

15:29.320 --> 15:36.800
Cause this is what I would spend $200 on.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.200
Domino rally was the shit.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.080
Like your dominoes would do like loop de loops.

15:43.080 --> 15:48.360
Check out that awesome 80s power music to this commercial and like dominoes would go

15:48.360 --> 15:56.640
down slides and this took all day to set up for like 10 seconds of fun.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.240
Domino rally, get all three sets.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.000
I would have spent $200 on domino rally.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.920
All right, anyway, uh, I guess we should talk about our gaming weeks, but dark Sakura left,

16:08.920 --> 16:10.240
so I guess we'll do things out of order.

16:10.240 --> 16:13.200
Uh, we'll move into our gaming weeks, the types of video games that you have been playing

16:13.200 --> 16:14.200
this week.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.200
And Loki will start tonight with you since, um, dark soccer left the room real quick.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.520
Her husband just got home, so I think she had to go tend to mainly grand theft auto

16:20.520 --> 16:21.520
four usual.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.880
Um, you know, still playing lost and damned.

16:23.880 --> 16:26.120
We moved to airport games now.

16:26.120 --> 16:31.760
And my coworker was getting slightly better at, uh, killing people in the airport.

16:31.760 --> 16:36.560
And of course I refined my technique and now I'm up there with him again.

16:36.560 --> 16:40.920
Uh, but we're having some pretty high scoring games, like $3,000 games, which is pretty

16:40.920 --> 16:41.920
awesome.

16:41.920 --> 16:47.560
Um, and then of course, uh, actually played a little bit of saints road, the second or

16:47.560 --> 16:55.960
saints row two on PC, uh, with a wonderful add on patch from, um, a group, uh, called

16:55.960 --> 16:57.720
idle Ninja.

16:57.720 --> 17:03.280
And they have a patch, uh, mod, if you will, called gentlemen of the row.

17:03.280 --> 17:08.800
And what it does is it fixes a lot of stuff that's in, in the game that was buggy because

17:08.800 --> 17:15.640
the saints row two PC version is a terrible, terrible port, but they fixed it for the most

17:15.640 --> 17:21.760
part and they've added a lot of cool stuff to it, new weapons, new, um, you know, slider

17:21.760 --> 17:22.760
abilities.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.960
You can make your character look really ridiculous.

17:24.960 --> 17:30.360
I had some like topless green chick that it was really hideous looking.

17:30.360 --> 17:34.160
It was just like some, I don't even know what, and I actually, I'm going to start a new game

17:34.160 --> 17:36.200
because I don't want to look at that character anymore.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.280
It's just weird.

17:37.280 --> 17:45.240
But um, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff and new gang types and clothing options and

17:45.240 --> 17:47.480
just all sorts of crazy stuff.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.920
And of course, you know, that's a free mod to download.

17:49.920 --> 17:53.680
So worth checking out if you have the PC version cause it probably would fix a lot of the problems

17:53.680 --> 17:54.680
that you have there.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.060
Just gearing up, you know, for saints row the third, which hopefully I'll be playing

17:57.060 --> 17:58.920
this week at some point.

17:58.920 --> 18:05.040
And um, and then let's see, other than that, I played a plants versus zombies on the iPod

18:05.040 --> 18:06.840
again and went back to that a little bit.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.240
I'm on the roof now and they had a huge sale at Halloween time too.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.200
I think you could get it for like 99 cents.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.200
Yeah.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.200
I mean, I liked the game.

18:14.200 --> 18:18.760
It's, it's a little annoying that it just keeps ramping, like it keeps changing the

18:18.760 --> 18:20.360
game like every single level.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.000
Now mind it like, do you want the same stage as every level?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
That would be boring.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
No.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.440
It just, it should get more difficult, you know, just like, I don't know.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.440
They put new game mechanics in every stage.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.440
Yes.

18:32.440 --> 18:33.440
Exactly.

18:33.440 --> 18:34.440
Um, and that's fine.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.040
You know, it's pretty cool.

18:36.040 --> 18:41.640
So I've been playing a little bit of that and then, um, what else?

18:41.640 --> 18:49.480
Uh, that's pretty much it actually just not hold on, but I mean, I can't wait.

18:49.480 --> 18:54.280
I'm just like, ah, I need the, I need the safe for the third.

18:54.280 --> 18:55.280
I need it.

18:55.280 --> 18:58.320
Hoping your distributor connections will come through and you can get the game early this

18:58.320 --> 18:59.320
week.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.320
We'll see.

19:00.320 --> 19:04.680
After, after the week I've had, um, just next Sunday is going to be a big gaming week show

19:04.680 --> 19:05.960
because hopefully look, you'll have that.

19:05.960 --> 19:09.960
I'll have Skyrim, dark soccer will have, I don't know what she'll have, but it'll be

19:09.960 --> 19:10.960
good.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.600
I'll have a weekend that I can sleep through.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.600
All right.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.600
Dark soccer.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.400
Uh, sorry we started without you, but we'll go back and do your gaming.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.400
That's okay.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.400
I had to potty.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.600
Oh, I thought you ran out and said hi to Dan cause I already got home.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.600
All right.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.600
Well, what's up?

19:24.600 --> 19:25.600
How was your gaming week?

19:25.600 --> 19:30.720
Um, I played well and I played DC universe online, which is kind of ass.

19:30.720 --> 19:31.720
You didn't like it?

19:31.720 --> 19:36.080
Well, I'm not saying that I hated it, but the control is really crabby and I hate that

19:36.080 --> 19:39.940
you have to keep turning the camera as you're running and doing everything.

19:39.940 --> 19:42.400
And with my trackball mouse, it's just not reasonable.

19:42.400 --> 19:47.920
I mean I could do it really easy in portal too, but I can't really do it for DC universe.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.920
You know why?

19:48.920 --> 19:49.920
Why?

19:49.920 --> 19:50.920
Because it sucks?

19:50.920 --> 19:51.920
Well, no, not because it sucks.

19:51.920 --> 19:52.920
I mean maybe it sucks.

19:52.920 --> 19:53.920
Cause trackball sucks.

19:53.920 --> 19:54.920
I don't know how you do it.

19:54.920 --> 19:55.920
I hate trackballs.

19:55.920 --> 20:02.920
Mainly because I think the game is meant more to played with a controller than, cause using

20:02.920 --> 20:06.480
like a right analog stick to control your camera is kind of natural for a lot of people.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.840
You might want to give it another go with an Xbox 360 controller plugged into your computer

20:09.840 --> 20:13.240
if you have any wired ones because the game will pick it right up because the game was

20:13.240 --> 20:17.920
designed to be console slash, you know, kind of like Final Fantasy 11 was and you felt

20:17.920 --> 20:19.720
more comfortable with that on the controller.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.640
That might be the trick or it might not.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.640
I don't know.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.640
I mean DC universe is very different kind of game.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.960
But I've also been playing more with keyboard and mouse so much lately and keep in mind

20:26.960 --> 20:30.200
using a regular controller actually hurts my hands after awhile.

20:30.200 --> 20:35.800
So I can't play a game for a long period of time like I can if you use keyboard and mouse.

20:35.800 --> 20:39.160
You should try one of those things that look like a kickboard that they were pimping on

20:39.160 --> 20:41.120
all games network awhile back.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.120
Oh no.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.120
That thing was painful.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.120
Oh yeah.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.120
We, we, uh, I gave them to you.

20:46.120 --> 20:51.280
No, actually no you didn't, but I saw one at the store and it's too painful.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.280
It's too bad.

20:52.280 --> 20:53.280
It was painful.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.640
I don't know if I remember seeing one, um, I don't remember what they're even called

20:56.640 --> 21:01.240
now, but they look like they had all these weird, uh, almost like a spider like thing

21:01.240 --> 21:03.060
over the controller that you hear.

21:03.060 --> 21:06.720
It's supposed to improve your reaction time by like hitting the different buttons by kind

21:06.720 --> 21:09.440
of moving your fingers in different ways and something like that.

21:09.440 --> 21:10.440
Yeah, they're terrible.

21:10.440 --> 21:14.120
My coworker just went home, uh, Brad from pod cultures in our chat room right now and

21:14.120 --> 21:16.480
says a pack controls are just fine.

21:16.480 --> 21:17.720
Use a 360 controller.

21:17.720 --> 21:23.800
So another vote to, uh, try a controller, I guess I was again, I know, I know, but just,

21:23.800 --> 21:28.200
I'm just saying, yeah, I mean, honestly I'm playing a PC game because I want to play a

21:28.200 --> 21:32.880
PC game and you know, it's, it's fine.

21:32.880 --> 21:36.520
There's also, I ran into way too many derps by the time I got through the brainiac thing.

21:36.520 --> 21:42.400
I think right now is not a good time to get into DC universe.

21:42.400 --> 21:47.040
You want to wait a month or two to be honest, it's going to be moot anyway cause star Trek

21:47.040 --> 21:48.040
online.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.040
True.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.680
I was talking about this on Horde house, the Warcraft show I do this week and um, you know,

21:52.680 --> 21:56.100
we had a guest on that was talking about the star Wars MMO that's coming out and he was

21:56.100 --> 21:59.240
playing the beta of that and I said, there's no way in hell I'm playing this when it comes

21:59.240 --> 22:00.240
out.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.240
It's like, why not?

22:01.240 --> 22:02.240
It's great.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.000
I said, because you don't want to play any MMO in the first month when they, you know,

22:05.000 --> 22:09.120
either launch a new expansion, launch the new game, launch free to play, whatever it

22:09.120 --> 22:12.360
is, because it's just swarming with people.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.040
You have to wait for it to kind of level out a little bit.

22:14.040 --> 22:22.240
I think Star Trek online stayed pretty consistent because no one played Star Trek did, but you

22:22.240 --> 22:28.960
had fans that were playing it and they were less derp than the usual derp, you know, and

22:28.960 --> 22:31.880
I guess DC universe I would have hoped would have been the same, but everyone knows who

22:31.880 --> 22:33.080
freaking Batman is.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.720
But DC universe is also just a really different MMO.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.880
Like it's not, wow, it's really not, wow.

22:37.880 --> 22:41.840
It's more like, imagine if Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game was an MMO.

22:41.840 --> 22:48.480
It's like playing city of heroes, but even worse control city of heroes is fine.

22:48.480 --> 22:52.640
This way I could play Star Trek online because it played like city of heroes, which is no

22:52.640 --> 22:53.640
problem.

22:53.640 --> 22:57.240
But of course me and my Marvel love, I made a chick Hawkeye anyway.

22:57.240 --> 23:00.920
I mean, her name is Hawk in Hebrew.

23:00.920 --> 23:06.880
Maybe that was just your problem is you just couldn't, I've been enjoying watching Dan

23:06.880 --> 23:13.800
play through, um, Arkham city Batman's Batman, you know, that, and I just think the whole

23:13.800 --> 23:17.720
Batman cat woman thing is, I actually sat down and read two DC comics.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.720
Wow.

23:18.720 --> 23:22.320
I read the first two issues of the new cat man, not cat man, cat woman thing, because

23:22.320 --> 23:24.120
it had Batman lucky in it.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.120
Wow.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.120
All right.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.920
It was pretty hot too.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.040
Anything else for your gaming week?

23:29.040 --> 23:31.560
You want to share, um, Oh yeah.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.020
Our type on the iPhone.

23:34.020 --> 23:35.020
Really hard to control.

23:35.020 --> 23:39.200
I was going to say, I mean, no, it's actually not hard to control, but like once it's like,

23:39.200 --> 23:40.200
it's how I am with our type.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.720
Anyway, once you lose those powerups, it's sort of like, Oh, what's the point?

23:43.720 --> 23:45.920
I'm going to die in five seconds.

23:45.920 --> 23:50.880
I am done playing classic games ported to the iPhone, but I like just listening to the

23:50.880 --> 23:51.880
music on it.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.840
I just, they all control rage too, by the way.

23:54.840 --> 23:55.880
What if I played on the phone?

23:55.880 --> 23:56.880
That's terrible.

23:56.880 --> 24:01.080
I played street to rage two for free controls, terrible Sonic, terrible.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.320
The Capcom arcade collection, terrible.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.580
They're all terrible.

24:04.580 --> 24:06.880
And it's because X-Men played pretty good.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.360
Well, yeah, it's probably terrible too.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.920
No, it was okay.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.680
If freeze my phone, then it's terrible.

24:13.680 --> 24:19.200
No, it was awesome because it was X-Men and it's prepared to die.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.200
All right.

24:20.200 --> 24:26.400
I also tried a little bit of crafted, which is the Minecraft knockoff on, um, the iPod

24:26.400 --> 24:27.520
iPhone or whatever.

24:27.520 --> 24:28.520
That's 2d.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.520
Yeah.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.960
I, I care about that as much as I care about Minecraft.

24:31.960 --> 24:35.040
That's just like, Nope, don't care.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.040
Try playing it.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.040
Sounds like Terraria.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.120
I also have something else.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.120
Can I talk about it now?

24:39.120 --> 24:40.120
What?

24:40.120 --> 24:42.240
The other fun thing I've been playing with that isn't a game, but related to a game.

24:42.240 --> 24:45.000
I've been playing with the well model viewer.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Why is that?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Just because you're obsessed with wow.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.360
Well, because there's a web comic going to be coming out called called Hills Bread Blues.

24:51.360 --> 24:55.360
Keep your eyes open everybody, but I bet I've been playing.

24:55.360 --> 24:58.800
Actually I spent last night while my internet was down looking through all the different

24:58.800 --> 25:03.480
models and finding like the unused ones and all the derp ones and finding like what the

25:03.480 --> 25:04.480
spawners look like.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.240
So if you see a bunny, be careful.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.240
It could spawn something.

25:08.240 --> 25:13.760
They use bunnies a lot for spawning things, but yeah, it's just kind of fun.

25:13.760 --> 25:19.560
I found Alfred Copperworth and I found Alexandra McQueen.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.960
So I'm just laughing at the NPC names.

25:21.960 --> 25:22.960
Good times.

25:22.960 --> 25:23.960
I think it's fun.

25:23.960 --> 25:24.960
Yeah.

25:24.960 --> 25:25.960
Let's see.

25:25.960 --> 25:26.960
Let's see what makes my games tick.

25:26.960 --> 25:27.960
Okay.

25:27.960 --> 25:32.600
Um, my gaming week, I've played Warcraft as well, but I've played a heck of a lot of console

25:32.600 --> 25:33.600
stuff too.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.440
I want to talk about a few games I've been playing this week.

25:35.440 --> 25:39.660
Um, the first I'll talk about is a game called Disney universe, which came out, um, a couple

25:39.660 --> 25:45.080
of weeks ago and it's on, I think 360 and PS3 might be on PC as well.

25:45.080 --> 25:50.400
It at first glance, it looks like a little big planet Disney game.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.960
And I would say that's true to an extent, but the game itself plays more like a Lego

25:53.960 --> 25:54.960
game.

25:54.960 --> 25:55.960
Like if you played those.

25:55.960 --> 25:59.200
I saw the trailer actually for the game when it was the ghostbusters and it's, and I've,

25:59.200 --> 26:01.460
I've played the game a little bit and it's, it's cute.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.440
It's a basic platformer.

26:03.440 --> 26:08.420
Definitely something that like younger kids and tweens would get into those folks that

26:08.420 --> 26:13.080
are expecting it to be like kingdom hearts and no, it's a lot more simple.

26:13.080 --> 26:16.560
But if you're into Disney like I am and you like to collect things, cause the game has

26:16.560 --> 26:20.240
a lot of collectibles, especially like powering up different suits.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.500
Yes, there is a Tron suit.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.400
That's why, you know, I had to go with that.

26:23.400 --> 26:24.880
And it was also in the trailer.

26:24.880 --> 26:25.880
Yeah.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.320
And you know, there's, there's stuff from Pixar is involved too.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.560
So there's definitely a lot of stuff to just kind of absorb, but the game itself is very

26:31.560 --> 26:32.560
basic.

26:32.560 --> 26:36.400
It's definitely not the depth of little big planet.

26:36.400 --> 26:40.640
And therefore you have the $60 price tag, excuse me, I think it's actually a $50 price

26:40.640 --> 26:41.640
tag.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.640
It's $49.99.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.860
I actually got three games from the Amazon buy two, get one free sale, which are the

26:45.860 --> 26:47.400
games I'm talking about tonight.

26:47.400 --> 26:50.880
And so I don't really know exactly how much they all work cause I paid like a hundred

26:50.880 --> 26:51.880
dollars for free.

26:51.880 --> 26:52.880
It's 50 bucks retail.

26:52.880 --> 26:57.920
That's still asking a bit much, this is something that I think is going to be a great deal when

26:57.920 --> 27:00.660
it's on sale for 20 or 30.

27:00.660 --> 27:04.980
But if you're like really hardcore into Disney, or you really just want like a basic platformer

27:04.980 --> 27:07.880
for fun, something with collectibles, I think you'd be into it.

27:07.880 --> 27:11.960
But if you're looking for something a little more like a game with a lot more depth, I'm

27:11.960 --> 27:14.280
not so sure you're going to find it here.

27:14.280 --> 27:18.800
You definitely see the inspirations from little big planet, some of the mini games and so

27:18.800 --> 27:21.720
forth, which are cute, but very basic.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.800
The game is not anything you haven't played before.

27:24.800 --> 27:29.380
It's just with Disney looking sack boy characters, cute.

27:29.380 --> 27:35.040
A game that I played a bit more of was dance central two came out this past couple of weeks.

27:35.040 --> 27:39.500
And yeah, it's, it's definitely an improvement over the original.

27:39.500 --> 27:43.200
Some things I noticed right away, fitness mode, it's like 10 times better.

27:43.200 --> 27:47.240
They have some prearranged fitness playlist that you can play, which I was having a lot

27:47.240 --> 27:48.240
of fun with.

27:48.240 --> 27:52.280
There's a story mode kind of built into it, which encourages you to mix up the songs a

27:52.280 --> 27:54.280
little more too.

27:54.280 --> 27:59.160
It's kind of okay to dabble into songs that are a higher difficulty on easy.

27:59.160 --> 28:02.600
And I think the way the older game was structured, you really kind of felt like you had to kind

28:02.600 --> 28:06.720
of go down the list of songs, but they, this one really kind of shuffles things in the

28:06.720 --> 28:08.560
different modes a lot more.

28:08.560 --> 28:14.000
Of course you can import all of your dance central one songs, but one thing that disappointed

28:14.000 --> 28:17.600
me a little bit is that when you did that, and surely they had to know that there was

28:17.600 --> 28:19.720
a lot of people that were going to do that.

28:19.720 --> 28:26.280
It doesn't really integrate the dance central one stuff into the non arcade modes, like

28:26.280 --> 28:30.400
the fitness mode and the, you know, well, you can do a nonstop fitness, you can do it,

28:30.400 --> 28:33.480
but there aren't any like playlists that involve the dance central one stuff.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.920
At least that I found now, granted, you know, if it's there, I'm sure someone in chat will

28:36.920 --> 28:40.120
correct me here, but it wasn't immediately prevalent to me.

28:40.120 --> 28:43.520
And I was just hoping it would be integrated maybe a little bit more, but I understand

28:43.520 --> 28:45.160
they want to focus on the new stuff.

28:45.160 --> 28:53.800
My other slight problem with dance central two is I don't think the song list is as strong

28:53.800 --> 28:55.040
as the first game.

28:55.040 --> 28:59.280
There's some good songs in there, but there's also some kind of really derpy songs as well.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.260
Like there's a Justin Bieber song in there.

29:01.260 --> 29:05.640
There's a Britney cover in there and it's like harmonics is better than covers.

29:05.640 --> 29:08.640
Like I understand that Britney is very danceable and you want a Britney song in your game,

29:08.640 --> 29:10.460
but you shouldn't have to resort to covers.

29:10.460 --> 29:11.920
You can get another song.

29:11.920 --> 29:14.600
There's danceable songs out there that are not Britney Spears.

29:14.600 --> 29:15.600
And you know what?

29:15.600 --> 29:16.760
People probably don't care.

29:16.760 --> 29:17.760
Yeah.

29:17.760 --> 29:20.160
So I mean, but there was, there were some songs that made me laugh.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.840
Like there's had a ways, what is love?

29:21.840 --> 29:25.000
And so it made me really laugh that that was in the game and yes, you do the head Bob is

29:25.000 --> 29:30.520
part of it, but you know, that's the kind of thing you low for at parties, but you know,

29:30.520 --> 29:33.720
once you've played it once, you don't really want to play that song over and over again,

29:33.720 --> 29:39.580
but it did have some, it had some good songs, the dances.

29:39.580 --> 29:42.380
You know what guys out there?

29:42.380 --> 29:48.080
You're going to have to kind of let your inhibitions go for some of these dances because I'm all

29:48.080 --> 29:53.960
I have to say, if you play born this way by lady Gaga, expect to do moves like princess

29:53.960 --> 30:00.600
snaps and um, something about queen, like where you make the little crown, like she

30:00.600 --> 30:02.660
does in the video, if you've ever seen the board in this way video, they kind of put

30:02.660 --> 30:04.000
that dance move in there.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.160
So like I can just imagine a bunch of bros playing dance central too.

30:07.160 --> 30:11.480
I mean, not that that's really like the broski kind of game to be playing anyway, but let's

30:11.480 --> 30:15.960
just say that, you know, it found its way out at a frat party.

30:15.960 --> 30:21.520
Like if you want to impress the ladies, expect to really let your inhibitions go with some

30:21.520 --> 30:22.520
of these dances.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.880
Women like a man that's secure in his sexuality.

30:24.880 --> 30:25.880
That's very true.

30:25.880 --> 30:26.880
That's very true.

30:26.880 --> 30:32.820
So I'm just, I'm just saying it's a lot of the dances struck me as very feminine.

30:32.820 --> 30:37.160
I didn't find a lot of masculine dances, but whatever.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.960
Take that as it is.

30:38.960 --> 30:39.960
Have fun.

30:39.960 --> 30:40.960
That's all it is.

30:40.960 --> 30:43.520
Have your own home, uh, the fitness modes and stuff.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.520
It's a lot of fun.

30:44.520 --> 30:47.920
And so what, if you have to do princess snaps, it's funny.

30:47.920 --> 30:52.680
Um, the other game I've been playing a lot of, well, actually not a lot of, I just started

30:52.680 --> 30:57.400
it today, but I really want to go home and play more of it is Arkham city.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.600
Isn't it great?

30:58.600 --> 30:59.920
Is really good.

30:59.920 --> 31:00.920
Yeah.

31:00.920 --> 31:03.440
Um, I, you know, again, I'm only about maybe like an hour and a half into it, so I can't

31:03.440 --> 31:08.760
like totally review it, but I'll just say like, usually when I leave OLR, I want to

31:08.760 --> 31:09.760
go home and play.

31:09.760 --> 31:10.760
Wow.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.040
I want to go to the city because I'm like really into it.

31:12.040 --> 31:17.360
And the story, I say this, the story just get, I loved that you had like five villains

31:17.360 --> 31:21.440
within the first 15 minutes, but it didn't feel, it didn't feel like overload.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.260
It felt like it made sense of the story.

31:23.260 --> 31:24.260
It was good.

31:24.260 --> 31:29.520
Um, yeah, I love that it's open world now and that there's all these side quest things

31:29.520 --> 31:30.520
you can do.

31:30.520 --> 31:34.640
And it just, it's just, it's more fluid than the last one to me even like, I can't even

31:34.640 --> 31:35.640
put my finger on it.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.680
Like it's just, it's like, yeah.

31:38.680 --> 31:39.680
And that's really rad.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.160
Like that's, Oh man, I'll tell you something too.

31:42.160 --> 31:48.940
As you finish certain parts of the game, you actually, um, the dialogue amongst the inmates

31:48.940 --> 31:53.120
in the game will change that you overhear reflecting things that have happened in the

31:53.120 --> 31:54.160
game.

31:54.160 --> 31:58.280
So it's just not the same stale thing and you'll find different people in different

31:58.280 --> 32:04.200
areas and all the Joker trophy, not Joker, the, uh, the Riddler trophies.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.440
Those are hard.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.160
Some of those, some of them are just cake.

32:07.160 --> 32:11.560
They're right there, but some of them are really hard and, but the Catwoman switching

32:11.560 --> 32:13.640
out is actually pretty neat.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.680
So you'll get points that you can switch out with Catwoman.

32:16.680 --> 32:17.680
Very cool.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.680
Yeah.

32:18.680 --> 32:19.800
I put in the code to get that.

32:19.800 --> 32:26.920
So the game starts right away with a Catwoman based thing and you know, it's, it's, you're

32:26.920 --> 32:27.920
into it.

32:27.920 --> 32:28.920
It's, it's cool.

32:28.920 --> 32:31.320
So I, uh, yeah, I'm, I'm into it into that.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.200
I have to laugh.

32:33.200 --> 32:37.360
There's a move with Batman that you do that you start running, you slide under a door.

32:37.360 --> 32:41.440
She does the slide under the door thing, except she does it on her knees leaning back.

32:41.440 --> 32:48.340
So you get this flash of boob when every time you do it in the movie where she slides under

32:48.340 --> 32:50.120
a door like that or something like that.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.840
Well, new movies not out yet.

32:51.840 --> 32:52.840
We don't have returns.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.960
I don't think she did that.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.800
And on top of that, she didn't have the cleavage in Batman Returns.

32:59.800 --> 33:06.520
I mean, Batman Returns was what, 1993 full body black suit and this is the zip up jumpsuit

33:06.520 --> 33:11.960
Catwoman and like when, when cat, when that movie came out, Bane wasn't even in the Batman

33:11.960 --> 33:12.960
universe yet.

33:12.960 --> 33:13.960
I don't think so.

33:13.960 --> 33:18.280
You know, a lot's changed since then, but, um, yeah, I, I'm, I'm having a really good

33:18.280 --> 33:20.800
time with it, so I can't wait to go home and play more of it.

33:20.800 --> 33:24.120
It's um, we're having a good time, so yeah.

33:24.120 --> 33:27.280
Um, slick interface too.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.480
Like even right away from the menus, I was like, this is really cool.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.920
And I want to play the 3D.

33:31.920 --> 33:35.920
It has like 3D where it's, um, you can just use red and blue glasses or some type of,

33:35.920 --> 33:39.560
I don't know, I think some other type of glasses I'm sure they're selling, but uh, yeah, you

33:39.560 --> 33:41.800
can get 3D with a 2D TV, which is kind of cool.

33:41.800 --> 33:47.840
It's, I have to say that the whole thing is actually a very well done package.

33:47.840 --> 33:48.840
Mm hmm.

33:48.840 --> 33:52.060
Now Leo Shannon in our chat room says, yeah, but when you play Catwoman, they all refer

33:52.060 --> 33:54.080
to her, to her as bitch.

33:54.080 --> 33:57.800
Well, yeah, they call Batman the bat.

33:57.800 --> 34:04.040
They are, well, I mean, bitch is a little bit more derogatory, but I mean, I, well,

34:04.040 --> 34:08.560
whereas maybe they could use a little more variety in their derogative terms, I do get

34:08.560 --> 34:13.840
the sense that they're taunting Batman as well, but I haven't played as Catwoman much

34:13.840 --> 34:18.140
more than the opening sequence yet, but if they do just keep saying bitch, bitch, bitch,

34:18.140 --> 34:21.060
that does seem a little bit lazy to me.

34:21.060 --> 34:23.640
Pretty much, or they'll say it's the cat or Catwoman.

34:23.640 --> 34:27.520
I mean, they call her by name, but they also say, I mean, the first thing, if you've got

34:27.520 --> 34:31.640
a woman who's being annoying to you, what's the first thing you're going to call her?

34:31.640 --> 34:32.640
Bitch.

34:32.640 --> 34:33.640
Exactly.

34:33.640 --> 34:35.800
If there's a man being annoying to me, the first thing I think to call them is bitch

34:35.800 --> 34:36.800
too.

34:36.800 --> 34:37.800
You know?

34:37.800 --> 34:38.800
Yeah.

34:38.800 --> 34:39.800
Maybe I'm just an equal opportunity bitcher.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.320
Call him dick.

34:41.320 --> 34:45.200
But keep in mind this too, they might be calling you a bitch, but you're about ready to kick

34:45.200 --> 34:46.480
their ass.

34:46.480 --> 34:52.140
The one tiny negative I will say about Batman, granted I'm playing it on easy cause I really

34:52.140 --> 34:53.820
just want the story.

34:53.820 --> 34:59.220
It is a little bit button mashy, but it's button mashing with finesse.

34:59.220 --> 35:00.220
If that makes sense.

35:00.220 --> 35:03.560
Like it just, it's very fluid and it's cool.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.860
Like it's not to the point where I find it annoying.

35:05.860 --> 35:08.920
It's button mashy in the way that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game was

35:08.920 --> 35:11.040
button mashy and it was still fun.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.280
So that's all.

35:12.280 --> 35:16.260
I was also, I have to say that I really liked the artwork that's come out with the game.

35:16.260 --> 35:20.400
I'm sure on the harder modes, there's more to it than just button mashing, but I am playing

35:20.400 --> 35:21.400
it on easy.

35:21.400 --> 35:25.360
Anyway, there you go.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.600
That's pretty much been my gaming week.

35:26.600 --> 35:30.080
Let's talk about some housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's news.

35:30.080 --> 35:33.320
Quickly for the live listeners, I guess we just had a bit of an outage where we went

35:33.320 --> 35:34.320
down.

35:34.320 --> 35:35.320
We all get kicked from IRC.

35:35.320 --> 35:40.040
Dark Sakura, the house of Dark Sakura has been having some internet issues up and down.

35:40.040 --> 35:44.680
So for the sake of having a clean podcast, we are going to try and just tear straight

35:44.680 --> 35:48.280
through without really stopping because of downtimes.

35:48.280 --> 35:52.120
So we apologize to the live listeners, but it is an issue that's out of our control.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.900
Like Dark Sakura, you said your net's gone down like what, three times over the weekend

35:54.900 --> 35:57.820
and affected your rating in WoW last night?

35:57.820 --> 36:02.200
It's gone down off and on over the last three days and I thought that it was finally stable

36:02.200 --> 36:09.320
and we got all the way through ICC ice crumbs for those who don't know and get to Arthas

36:09.320 --> 36:12.600
and then it starts freezing on me and I knew it was going to go down again.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.500
No porn torrents.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.520
So we really thank, I've already downloaded Supernatural.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.240
We really thank the live listeners for tuning in and sticking it out.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.240
We apologize.

36:21.240 --> 36:24.640
We can't fix it, but it is an issue with our internet service provider.

36:24.640 --> 36:28.480
So for the sake of having a clean show, we're just going to try and push right through.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.600
If we go down, we are probably aware.

36:30.600 --> 36:35.280
So no need to send me 50 tells that we're down because we probably know.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.600
Also, I'll say this real quick.

36:38.600 --> 36:43.480
Podcast award results came out and we didn't win, which, you know, you have to prepare

36:43.480 --> 36:46.080
yourself for the fact that you probably won't win.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.360
The same show that won for the past couple of years, four player podcast, they won again,

36:49.360 --> 36:50.960
which is, you know, good for them.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.300
They work hard on what they do.

36:52.300 --> 36:56.220
It's an independent show and we always said from the top, we want an indie show to win

36:56.220 --> 36:57.800
and indie show did win.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.040
So that's awesome.

36:59.040 --> 37:04.520
And not only did they win the gaming one, they won the grande taco.

37:04.520 --> 37:05.520
They didn't win grande taco.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.320
It was something like best produced or best overall.

37:08.320 --> 37:12.160
I don't know, but they, they have a big community, a strong community.

37:12.160 --> 37:16.800
And so, you know, they, they had the votes getting cranked out every day.

37:16.800 --> 37:20.600
The podcast awards are a little bit of a popularity contest, so it really is about kind of who's

37:20.600 --> 37:22.280
got the most driven community.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.480
And obviously they've got a strong community.

37:24.480 --> 37:25.560
That's not me throwing shade.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.280
That is they, that's great.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.880
They've worked hard to build that up.

37:29.880 --> 37:35.160
Not that our community is any less because you guys, we were so thankful that you guys

37:35.160 --> 37:40.380
were putting out their call for retweets and posting on Facebook.

37:40.380 --> 37:43.920
Other all game shows were showing support for us, which really meant a lot.

37:43.920 --> 37:48.560
You guys, we saw, you know, we saw the plugs on other folks' website and the banners that

37:48.560 --> 37:52.360
were like, Hey, our show is not nominated, but go vote for these guys.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.840
Cause you know, we like them and you know, we're, we're on the same network.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.080
And that really meant a lot.

37:57.080 --> 38:00.460
And I'll also say what also meant a lot to us throughout this whole thing.

38:00.460 --> 38:06.000
That was awesome was that over on Facebook we actually posted, you know, the other night

38:06.000 --> 38:09.680
when we found out about the results, we kind of, you know, said, Hey, we didn't win, but

38:09.680 --> 38:11.020
you know, it's cool.

38:11.020 --> 38:16.000
At least we were nominated, you know, out of what, hundreds of gaming podcasts out there.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.600
We were one of 10 nominated and only half of them were general gaming shows.

38:19.600 --> 38:23.480
A lot of them were very specialized shows about Warcraft or other MMOs or what have

38:23.480 --> 38:24.800
you.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.240
So that was just really awesome to even have that.

38:27.240 --> 38:30.560
And the response we got on Facebook was just awesome.

38:30.560 --> 38:34.700
Like we got some comments on the posts like, uh, that by the way, this is at facebook.com

38:34.700 --> 38:35.700
slash orange lounge radio.

38:35.700 --> 38:37.200
If you're not a friend, you should add us.

38:37.200 --> 38:40.880
Like Terry replied and said, you won my award and that's all that matters.

38:40.880 --> 38:45.800
Six plus years and still listening, uh, Fabrice commented on the post saying, I'd even say

38:45.800 --> 38:50.200
you won our hearts making such a great podcast for so many years is quite an accomplishment

38:50.200 --> 38:56.720
and like stuff like that is makes my heart warm for just a moment.

38:56.720 --> 39:03.280
It does, but yeah, stuff like that is longer than a moment, Rob, what are you thinking?

39:03.280 --> 39:06.400
So I just want to say thank you guys so much.

39:06.400 --> 39:11.360
Everybody who supported us, even though we didn't win, it's all good.

39:11.360 --> 39:14.120
We're still here and we don't have any plans to go anywhere.

39:14.120 --> 39:20.160
So and so, um, that's it for housekeeping.

39:20.160 --> 39:23.860
Uh, if, as I mentioned, facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, twitter, twitter.com

39:23.860 --> 39:26.840
slash O L R and now the gaming news.

39:26.840 --> 39:27.840
Loki.

39:27.840 --> 39:28.840
Uh, yes.

39:28.840 --> 39:35.360
Um, so this week was pretty big, at least for me cause Hey, they, they put out a trailer

39:35.360 --> 39:38.020
for grant that out of five and that makes me happy.

39:38.020 --> 39:44.840
So yeah, so they pretty easily guessed a sequel to grant those out of four.

39:44.840 --> 39:51.300
Uh, now it's of course returning back to Los Santos as part of a grand theft auto San Andreas.

39:51.300 --> 39:57.520
This time I believe those supposed to be centralized more around one city as opposed to three like

39:57.520 --> 40:02.920
San Andreas was and um, mainly because you know, now they can really expand it and it

40:02.920 --> 40:03.920
looks just amazing.

40:03.920 --> 40:09.560
Of course, the rumors, you know, everyone's trying to dissect a trailer, figure out, okay,

40:09.560 --> 40:12.280
what's, what's this going to be about?

40:12.280 --> 40:13.560
Where are the new things in there?

40:13.560 --> 40:18.260
Some of the things that you see in the trailer, um, animals, there's a dog lease in a cut

40:18.260 --> 40:19.260
scene.

40:19.260 --> 40:22.800
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to kill animals, but obviously in their last

40:22.800 --> 40:26.840
game red dead redemption, there were plenty of animals running around that you could kill.

40:26.840 --> 40:30.200
That would be really risky for them to do that and incur the wrath of PETA.

40:30.200 --> 40:33.960
And I know you guys don't care about that stuff, but that is a bunch of like negative

40:33.960 --> 40:34.960
publicity.

40:34.960 --> 40:35.960
I think the game could do without.

40:35.960 --> 40:36.960
Yeah.

40:36.960 --> 40:40.480
Isn't that funny that people will get more bent out of shape about killing animals than

40:40.480 --> 40:41.480
they will killing people.

40:41.480 --> 40:45.000
I would have thought that that would have happened from red dead redemption and granted

40:45.000 --> 40:48.360
it's period specific, but I mean if you think about it, it's not like you're going around

40:48.360 --> 40:49.640
killing people's dogs.

40:49.640 --> 40:53.240
It's like, okay, they may be having, you know, police dogs coming after you or something

40:53.240 --> 40:57.040
like that or there might be wolves or something in the hills and you have to defend yourself

40:57.040 --> 40:58.040
or whatever.

40:58.040 --> 41:02.120
It's just people get very possessive about their cats and dogs almost more so than they

41:02.120 --> 41:03.120
do people.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.120
So.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.120
Oh, the PETA people are crazy.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.880
Well, I'm not, I'm not just saying PETA.

41:06.880 --> 41:10.240
Like if they're going to work that stuff into the game, they better tread carefully.

41:10.240 --> 41:11.240
That's all I'm saying.

41:11.240 --> 41:14.360
It's a, it's a, it's a volatile ground they're walking with that.

41:14.360 --> 41:20.160
Some of their stuff, um, of course, you know, planes coming back, uh, a lot more, uh, aircraft

41:20.160 --> 41:21.160
in there.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.680
Uh, a blimp is in there.

41:22.680 --> 41:27.320
Who knows if you can fly a blimp, but definitely it was something that was part of the, uh,

41:27.320 --> 41:30.120
you know, skyline that was kind of cool.

41:30.120 --> 41:35.680
Um, very variety, you know, there's a huge variety of landscapes there, everything from

41:35.680 --> 41:39.320
like the mountains to, you know, the city slums.

41:39.320 --> 41:43.360
They showed kind of three different characters in there that you might be playing as.

41:43.360 --> 41:49.080
One of those, the rumor to be, um, the main character from Vice City coming back.

41:49.080 --> 41:55.560
Um, and then also there looks like maybe CJ from San Andreas and then a new character,

41:55.560 --> 41:58.800
um, all making the return maybe to this game.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.360
Uh, at least that's all rumor stuff.

42:00.360 --> 42:06.600
Um, of course, multiplayer is going to be a big part of it as well and, um, no word

42:06.600 --> 42:10.200
of course on any sort of, uh, release time frame.

42:10.200 --> 42:17.240
Although if I were to be, you know, a guessing man, I'd say, uh, fourth quarter 2012, just

42:17.240 --> 42:22.000
in time for the Wii U launch, it would be a good timing if they want to Grand Theft Auto

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
on their platform.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.240
Sorry, can I say this about the pet discussion we were having a minute ago, Akuma JP in our

42:27.240 --> 42:30.440
chat room says, don't worry, all dogs go to heaven.

42:30.440 --> 42:34.000
It's true, it's true.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.640
Cats on the other hand, no, I'm just kidding.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.640
I love kitties.

42:36.640 --> 42:37.640
I love all cats.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.640
Good thing Shirmi's not in here.

42:38.640 --> 42:39.640
All cats go to special heaven.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.320
She should make that face at you.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.760
Cats, no, cats go to special heaven.

42:42.760 --> 42:43.760
All right.

42:43.760 --> 42:44.760
Sorry, Loki.

42:44.760 --> 42:45.760
Yeah.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.840
So, um, but yeah, it's seriously amazing.

42:47.840 --> 42:50.960
If you haven't seen the trailer for whatever reason, go check it out.

42:50.960 --> 42:56.240
Rockstar games.com and uh, I can't wait to play it.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.880
It'll, it'll be awesome.

42:57.880 --> 42:59.440
And how many times did you watch the trailer?

42:59.440 --> 43:01.880
About 10, 15 times.

43:01.880 --> 43:05.520
People are really dissecting even just every little frame of that kind of like a movie

43:05.520 --> 43:06.520
trailer though.

43:06.520 --> 43:11.480
There's some really stupid people out there like, Hey, look at that address that's on

43:11.480 --> 43:12.480
there.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.480
That means it's coming out in May.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.000
I'm like, no, you're stupid.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.680
I'm a bit frightened now.

43:17.680 --> 43:18.680
What?

43:18.680 --> 43:21.080
Her last name is wooly Bush.

43:21.080 --> 43:22.080
Stop it.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.080
That's not related to the topic at hand.

43:23.080 --> 43:24.720
I'm going to make you close that.

43:24.720 --> 43:25.720
Okay.

43:25.720 --> 43:26.720
All right.

43:26.720 --> 43:30.600
Moving on to other news that does not have to do with dark soccer.

43:30.600 --> 43:32.960
Looking at the model viewer when she should be looking at her next story.

43:32.960 --> 43:34.480
Uh, looked at my story.

43:34.480 --> 43:35.840
What are you talking about?

43:35.840 --> 43:36.960
I want to talk about this.

43:36.960 --> 43:40.880
This is a game I don't think anyone in here has looked at funny enough because I don't

43:40.880 --> 43:46.440
think a one, excuse me, this is not usually the type of game we play, but he wanted to

43:46.440 --> 43:47.440
play.

43:47.440 --> 43:51.040
5 million, actually 5 million to be exact people out there that are playing this game

43:51.040 --> 43:52.040
this week.

43:52.040 --> 43:53.040
It's battlefield three.

43:53.040 --> 43:56.040
It is huge in the gaming industry.

43:56.040 --> 44:00.840
5 million gamers throughout the world bought battlefield three this week.

44:00.840 --> 44:03.000
That is internal estimates from EA.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.840
So that could be a little bit inflated, but to be honest, I wouldn't put it past that.

44:07.840 --> 44:11.600
That is actually the legit number.

44:11.600 --> 44:17.760
I guess at one point they were announcing that they moved 10 million units onto shelves.

44:17.760 --> 44:21.320
So this game is preparing to sell a lot more through the holiday season.

44:21.320 --> 44:24.640
So yep, I know a lot of my friends were playing this game.

44:24.640 --> 44:28.840
Even though I am terrible, terrible bad at first person shooters, I totally understand

44:28.840 --> 44:29.880
why people are into this.

44:29.880 --> 44:31.760
These games look phenomenal.

44:31.760 --> 44:35.520
The graphics are outstanding.

44:35.520 --> 44:41.560
And as far as the multiplayer experience goes, where you get to shoot, shoot, shoot to kill,

44:41.560 --> 44:42.560
it's a lot of fun.

44:42.560 --> 44:46.360
So, but Loki, you're trying to get this right now or what?

44:46.360 --> 44:53.400
Well, I was looking to maybe try it, at least the single player because it looked fun.

44:53.400 --> 44:59.400
Now, I was hearing a lot of buzz on Twitter that some people are really having problems

44:59.400 --> 45:02.400
with some of the origin integration and so forth.

45:02.400 --> 45:06.440
And you know, the servers were having a hard time, which I guess is to be expected the

45:06.440 --> 45:07.720
launch week of a game.

45:07.720 --> 45:11.720
You know, the servers are always having hiccups and so forth, but it sounds like there's a

45:11.720 --> 45:14.680
lot of rabble rabble about the origin integration.

45:14.680 --> 45:18.740
I want to say I was reading something about a crack has already come out for the PC version.

45:18.740 --> 45:23.680
Of course, this wouldn't affect the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 ones, but the PC one specifically,

45:23.680 --> 45:27.040
I guess a crack has come out that has now disabled the origin.

45:27.040 --> 45:30.720
Like you don't need it anymore, which is not a surprise at all.

45:30.720 --> 45:31.720
I'll tell you this.

45:31.720 --> 45:35.920
I didn't talk about this at the top of the show, but you guys know my Xbox was hacked

45:35.920 --> 45:36.920
a couple months ago.

45:36.920 --> 45:39.400
I got on the show, lost some money.

45:39.400 --> 45:44.360
I played the demo for need for speed, the run this week, because that's a game I'm actually

45:44.360 --> 45:47.960
looking forward to, but I don't play a lot of EA sports games.

45:47.960 --> 45:52.180
The only EA sports games I really get into these days are the racers.

45:52.180 --> 45:56.240
So the reason why I bring that up, when I logged into need for speed, the run, it told

45:56.240 --> 46:01.000
me that my Xbox live gamer tag had already been tied to an email account that wasn't

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
mine.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
It belonged to somebody else.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.920
In fact, I was able to Facebook that person and see what she looked like and wonder if

46:07.920 --> 46:10.240
that was the person that maybe took my money.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.160
Well, FIFA is an EA game.

46:12.160 --> 46:13.160
I know.

46:13.160 --> 46:16.320
I know FIFA is an EA game and this person made the account on there.

46:16.320 --> 46:17.640
Now, I don't know.

46:17.640 --> 46:20.600
The hacker could have just used a random email address.

46:20.600 --> 46:21.600
Well they would.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.840
It was interesting that I was able to look this person up on Facebook.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.520
You need to confirm it though.

46:25.520 --> 46:26.520
Like I don't know.

46:26.520 --> 46:27.520
They do.

46:27.520 --> 46:28.520
Yeah, you have to do three mil.

46:28.520 --> 46:29.520
Well, here's what I ended up doing.

46:29.520 --> 46:36.120
I called EA to get that unattached, to get my real EA account attached to my gamer tag

46:36.120 --> 46:40.360
because I wanted my actual one on there and I wanted that one unattached.

46:40.360 --> 46:45.760
I was on hold for 25 minutes waiting to speak to somebody over there.

46:45.760 --> 46:48.640
But granted, I'm calling the week the battlefield three comes out.

46:48.640 --> 46:52.920
So I wasn't too, you know, that's what speakerphone was invented for and you know, so I can sit

46:52.920 --> 46:54.960
and play Warcraft while I'm on speakerphone.

46:54.960 --> 46:57.240
But that was a little bit irritating.

46:57.240 --> 47:03.440
I will say this, and yet again, somebody posted on our Orange Launch Radio wall, I feel for

47:03.440 --> 47:04.440
you, Sky.

47:04.440 --> 47:05.840
I just got hacked this week.

47:05.840 --> 47:09.920
And my response was, dude, we told you change your password.

47:09.920 --> 47:13.400
So people out there on Xbox, please, please change your password.

47:13.400 --> 47:16.520
And this is what I'm going to honestly recommend you do.

47:16.520 --> 47:22.100
Go download the demo for either NBA Jam or Need for Speed The Run, especially Need for

47:22.100 --> 47:23.100
Speed The Run.

47:23.100 --> 47:25.320
If you like racer games like it all, like check that one out because that's actually

47:25.320 --> 47:26.320
kind of rad.

47:26.320 --> 47:29.560
The snow level is pretty awesome.

47:29.560 --> 47:35.120
Check out the demo because when you play the demo, you can attach an EA account.

47:35.120 --> 47:39.640
And I would think if you could do that in advance, it might help against the hackers.

47:39.640 --> 47:46.240
Like I'm not sure, again, nobody knows what they're doing besides charging up these money.

47:46.240 --> 47:50.020
I think they're loading up Xbox Live accounts and then trying to sell them or something.

47:50.020 --> 47:52.400
So I don't know what it is they're really doing.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.720
So it's hard to say what measures to take to prevent it.

47:54.720 --> 47:59.240
Well, what they're doing is I think is like you can download that content to your console

47:59.240 --> 48:01.040
and then you don't need that account anymore.

48:01.040 --> 48:04.800
It's like kind of downloading a full version of a game, I don't know.

48:04.800 --> 48:11.840
I will say this, everybody I know who got hacked, none of them play EA sports games.

48:11.840 --> 48:14.520
And it's just an interesting trend I'm noticing.

48:14.520 --> 48:18.440
So go get your Xbox Live account attached to an EA account.

48:18.440 --> 48:22.680
I hate that I'm telling you to go sign up for an EA account because in a perfect world,

48:22.680 --> 48:27.600
I would be saying, clearly there's an issue here that nobody's admitting to, which is

48:27.600 --> 48:35.840
infuriatingly difficult, but go do it because you don't want to lose $150 like one of our

48:35.840 --> 48:37.380
other listeners did this week.

48:37.380 --> 48:39.920
So please, please don't be like us.

48:39.920 --> 48:43.460
Change your Xbox Live password now if you haven't already.

48:43.460 --> 48:47.120
And you know what, take the extra precaution and attach an EA account to it through the

48:47.120 --> 48:51.360
need for speed to run demo or any EA sports demo that's out there.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.880
There you go.

48:53.880 --> 48:57.000
Tekniss in our chat room disagrees with me.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.120
Need for speed to run looks horrible, but it uses the EA login for all their games via

49:01.120 --> 49:02.120
origin.

49:02.120 --> 49:06.600
I played it on 360, not PC, so I didn't have the whole origin thing, but I kind of liked

49:06.600 --> 49:07.600
it.

49:07.600 --> 49:08.600
It was cool.

49:08.600 --> 49:09.600
I don't know.

49:09.600 --> 49:10.600
But I like racing games too.

49:10.600 --> 49:11.600
I like arcade racers like that.

49:11.600 --> 49:15.900
Like I can't do Forza or Gran Turismo, but I can totally do need for speed and burnout.

49:15.900 --> 49:18.080
So that's just me.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.080
All right.

49:19.080 --> 49:23.760
Ikuma JP asks in our chat room, is EA the hacker?

49:23.760 --> 49:24.760
Who knows?

49:24.760 --> 49:25.760
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

49:25.760 --> 49:27.640
They do like money.

49:27.640 --> 49:29.960
Let's move on with some more gaming news, DarkSakura.

49:29.960 --> 49:35.360
Well, as I mentioned earlier, this is a game that I've been playing sort of as DC Universe

49:35.360 --> 49:36.640
Online.

49:36.640 --> 49:44.040
It's gone free to play and it's been sending the game down for maintenance off and on,

49:44.040 --> 49:46.440
which I've actually run into myself.

49:46.440 --> 49:54.600
But you can actually go download it through the Sega Online Entertainment launcher and

49:54.600 --> 49:57.640
the game's being revamped to handle the people.

49:57.640 --> 50:08.240
And also their user numbers have hit 330,000 players, which is a 600% increase.

50:08.240 --> 50:11.620
This is pretty crazy.

50:11.620 --> 50:15.880
Meaning that everybody went to check this game out the minute it went free to play.

50:15.880 --> 50:16.880
Yeah.

50:16.880 --> 50:17.880
I mean, I was curious.

50:17.880 --> 50:18.880
I checked it out.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.320
I know a lot of people that did.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.320
Don't care for it.

50:21.320 --> 50:24.240
I'm not going to play it anymore, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't have paid for it.

50:24.240 --> 50:25.240
I'll tell you this.

50:25.240 --> 50:27.120
I would have been really pissed if I'd been paying for it.

50:27.120 --> 50:30.400
I played it during the beta and I liked it enough where I would have played it more,

50:30.400 --> 50:33.440
but I didn't want to be paying for multiple MMOs because I think at the time I was playing

50:33.440 --> 50:36.320
the beta, I was playing for wow and something else.

50:36.320 --> 50:39.240
And I don't remember what it was, but I, yeah, I didn't want to add another one into the

50:39.240 --> 50:42.320
mix, so I didn't go through with it and I was really happy when they announced they

50:42.320 --> 50:43.760
went free to play.

50:43.760 --> 50:47.760
But then I heard the first day just that the servers are crashing left and right, which

50:47.760 --> 50:48.760
doesn't surprise me.

50:48.760 --> 50:49.760
So I'm going to wait.

50:49.760 --> 50:53.760
Well, the login's taking forever and it would like freeze at the loading your character

50:53.760 --> 50:54.760
screen.

50:54.760 --> 50:57.000
I was just like, you know what, this isn't worth it to me.

50:57.000 --> 51:02.240
I'm already paying for one game that I like and another game that I like is coming out

51:02.240 --> 51:03.240
free to play.

51:03.240 --> 51:04.240
So why am I worried?

51:04.240 --> 51:06.040
I'll still check out DC Universe.

51:06.040 --> 51:08.700
I like the idea that it's a console MMO.

51:08.700 --> 51:14.120
I might get it on PS3, although all my friends are on PC, just because, I don't know, I like

51:14.120 --> 51:16.920
the idea of an MMO on my console.

51:16.920 --> 51:18.920
Kind of fun.

51:18.920 --> 51:20.440
I like DC Universe well enough.

51:20.440 --> 51:21.440
I'll check it out now.

51:21.440 --> 51:22.840
It's free to play.

51:22.840 --> 51:23.840
I'm not as humbuggy.

51:23.840 --> 51:27.240
All right, let's move on with some more news.

51:27.240 --> 51:37.080
All right, so this is kind of sad, I guess, but Silicon Knights, they've cut their staff

51:37.080 --> 51:43.440
by nearly 75%, going from almost 100 people down to 25, and of course they just released

51:43.440 --> 51:49.360
X-Men Destiny, which didn't really get that great reviews, and Too Human, which really

51:49.360 --> 51:51.040
didn't get good reviews.

51:51.040 --> 51:59.520
So yeah, that might be a good reason why they're cutting.

51:59.520 --> 52:06.560
But yeah, apparently it has been confirmed that they had those layoffs, and although

52:06.560 --> 52:12.000
they're saying that the number is actually maybe a little bit lower than that, because

52:12.000 --> 52:15.380
they're also creating new jobs as well.

52:15.380 --> 52:18.960
So I don't know.

52:18.960 --> 52:26.520
It's interesting that these cuts have to happen, but I guess since they just finished the game

52:26.520 --> 52:30.080
and it didn't do that well, so they can't.

52:30.080 --> 52:37.200
Sadly this is kind of what happens a lot lately, which doesn't make the news any better to

52:37.200 --> 52:38.200
report.

52:38.200 --> 52:43.240
Yeah, I mean it's just, I'm not surprised.

52:43.240 --> 52:48.040
I thought X-Men Destiny looked all right, but apparently it seemed rushed, and maybe

52:48.040 --> 52:56.080
that's not necessarily the fault of them, but I kind of think it might be a little bit,

52:56.080 --> 53:00.080
or a little bit to blame, because I mean look at Too Human, a game that was delayed and

53:00.080 --> 53:04.520
delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed, and it still sucked when it came out.

53:04.520 --> 53:09.760
So I don't know if more time would have actually helped them in this case, but it probably

53:09.760 --> 53:12.700
didn't help that they were a little short in time.

53:12.700 --> 53:17.000
I guess the silver lining though is that a lot of times when these studios have these

53:17.000 --> 53:21.320
massive layoffs, the big people kind of go tend to form their own new company.

53:21.320 --> 53:26.840
Like that kind of happened with Bazaar recently, which I still cannot believe that they shut

53:26.840 --> 53:28.080
that studio down.

53:28.080 --> 53:30.040
I mean I do and I don't.

53:30.040 --> 53:33.240
Like it was horrible.

53:33.240 --> 53:38.320
But you know, they go start a new company and it might turn out okay.

53:38.320 --> 53:41.320
Another company that have some layoffs, Gameforge.

53:41.320 --> 53:51.000
They're kind of known for doing some browser-based games, but also they dropped their staff from

53:51.000 --> 53:54.360
450 down to 350.

53:54.360 --> 54:00.080
And of course they've recently cancelled a few different games, Mythos and Hellbreed,

54:00.080 --> 54:04.560
and I guess they're not sure if they're going to be able to finish now a, it was supposed

54:04.560 --> 54:10.960
to be a free-to-play or a freemium Star Trek game, Star Trek Infinite Space, that they

54:10.960 --> 54:13.360
were going to be co-publishing.

54:13.360 --> 54:17.440
I wonder if Star Trek Online going free-to-play somehow ended up being a conflict of interest

54:17.440 --> 54:18.440
with this.

54:18.440 --> 54:21.160
Just a random thought, I don't know.

54:21.160 --> 54:22.160
Maybe.

54:22.160 --> 54:23.160
I don't know.

54:23.160 --> 54:24.160
I mean it looks kind of cool.

54:24.160 --> 54:28.480
I don't know much about it though, it's kind of the first time I've heard of it.

54:28.480 --> 54:31.880
And of course their comment is, you know, through a more efficient, organized structure

54:31.880 --> 54:38.600
we can optimize our use of resource and greater fluff, fluff, PR fluff, fluff, fluff, fluff,

54:38.600 --> 54:40.800
trying not to sound evil and terrible.

54:40.800 --> 54:41.800
Fluff fluff.

54:41.800 --> 54:42.800
Yeah.

54:42.800 --> 54:43.800
Which.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.800
It's all of like, well we gotta cut costs so we're gonna have more people, or less people

54:46.800 --> 54:47.800
doing more.

54:47.800 --> 54:48.800
Yeah.

54:48.800 --> 54:52.000
I've heard that one over and over and over again.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Yeah.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
It's unfortunate.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.120
Once you get down to like five jobs per person, then yeah.

54:57.120 --> 55:01.000
Let's hope these guys maybe can team up with the other ones who just got laid off and hopefully

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
start a new studio that makes some awesome things that's better managed.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Let's hope.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
Let's hope.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Mm-hmm.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Alright.

55:09.000 --> 55:13.960
Anyhow, moving on with some more game news that hopefully is a little less depressing.

55:13.960 --> 55:16.640
Well if you're a Sony fan this is actually pretty exciting news.

55:16.640 --> 55:23.320
The PlayStation 3 is catching up to the Xbox 360 in terms of shipments.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.520
Quarter 2, it was reported of fiscal.

55:25.520 --> 55:32.780
Fiscal Quarter 2 2011, it was reported that Sony has sold 3.7 million PS3 units around

55:32.780 --> 55:35.960
the world and that quarter ended September 30th.

55:35.960 --> 55:42.340
So they have sold thus far 55.5 million units and they're improving.

55:42.340 --> 55:48.000
Microsoft has 57.6 million shipped units worldwide.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.740
So they're getting really neck and neck.

55:50.740 --> 55:55.120
Sony could overtake this number two position depending on how the holidays and next year

55:55.120 --> 55:56.920
goes.

55:56.920 --> 56:00.880
Keep in mind we don't know if these companies are talking about what's called sell through

56:00.880 --> 56:02.800
or sell in.

56:02.800 --> 56:05.600
Sell through means all the way to the consumer at home.

56:05.600 --> 56:08.440
Sell in means just on the retail shelves.

56:08.440 --> 56:14.360
Either way though just I mean this news isn't that surprising just kind of looking out there

56:14.360 --> 56:16.560
on the internet at the chat that's going on.

56:16.560 --> 56:22.140
I see a lot more people seem to be picking up PS3s and not surprisingly a lot of it is

56:22.140 --> 56:24.680
the same thing that drove the PS2 sales.

56:24.680 --> 56:26.180
It's Blu-ray.

56:26.180 --> 56:30.840
Back when it was PS2 it was the DVD except the problem was Blu-ray wasn't as widely adopted

56:30.840 --> 56:34.760
when PlayStation 3 first came out as it is now and I think you get a lot of people that

56:34.760 --> 56:37.880
are buying PlayStation 3s because they're relatively cheap Blu-ray players.

56:37.880 --> 56:39.800
Not just that they're 3D Blu-ray players.

56:39.800 --> 56:40.800
Yeah.

56:40.800 --> 56:44.720
So people that are getting these 3D TVs are buying PlayStation 3s because like hey I can

56:44.720 --> 56:47.640
play 3D movies and I can play Arkham City.

56:47.640 --> 56:48.640
You know?

56:48.640 --> 56:51.440
Honestly the games are getting better on the system.

56:51.440 --> 56:55.240
They didn't have much for a while and now they're really getting the good ones.

56:55.240 --> 56:58.840
Everybody in the gaming world gave PlayStation 3 shit when it came out.

56:58.840 --> 57:01.760
Everybody except the very hardcore Sony fans.

57:01.760 --> 57:07.280
It took them a long time but now they've made steady progress to try and get better.

57:07.280 --> 57:13.800
I still don't think everything is all roses and sunshine like PlayStation Move.

57:13.800 --> 57:19.100
Are they still trying with PlayStation Move Loki or did they finally just kind of shuffle

57:19.100 --> 57:20.100
it to the back?

57:20.100 --> 57:21.100
No they're definitely still trying.

57:21.100 --> 57:22.100
Are they?

57:22.100 --> 57:28.800
They've got a bunch of new games coming out and new bundles to try to drive PlayStation

57:28.800 --> 57:29.800
Move stuff.

57:29.800 --> 57:36.980
I mean looking at just the month of November you've got the GoldenEye 00 edition that comes

57:36.980 --> 57:40.560
with the Move and all the Sharpshooter stuff.

57:40.560 --> 57:42.040
Which that came out last week.

57:42.040 --> 57:46.760
And then in a few weeks you've got LittleBigPlanet 2 Special Edition which is getting you know

57:46.760 --> 57:48.400
Move support as well.

57:48.400 --> 57:52.880
And then also they've added like a bundle that they're going to do with the Move stuff

57:52.880 --> 57:55.820
with LittleBigPlanet 2 Special Edition.

57:55.820 --> 58:03.840
There's also a bundle with sports champions at medieval moves deadman's quest.

58:03.840 --> 58:07.080
And then that game is also coming out by itself from Sony Plus.

58:07.080 --> 58:10.080
I petting friends.

58:10.080 --> 58:13.320
That is coming out as well if anyone gives a shit.

58:13.320 --> 58:14.320
And then.

58:14.320 --> 58:15.320
And kids.

58:15.320 --> 58:20.960
You know and they've got some new bundles and hardware stuff.

58:20.960 --> 58:22.920
Maybe I'm just kind of like poo pooing the Move.

58:22.920 --> 58:25.360
There's a lot of games that support it.

58:25.360 --> 58:27.600
Everything I see is about Kinect.

58:27.600 --> 58:31.900
And even then like this year I don't think Kinect is going to have the same impact this

58:31.900 --> 58:32.900
year.

58:32.900 --> 58:37.640
But honestly if I had a choice between playing a Kinect game and a Move game of the same

58:37.640 --> 58:38.640
game.

58:38.640 --> 58:45.020
I'd rather play the Move game and just it seems to be more accurate to me.

58:45.020 --> 58:50.920
I really kind of want to play Child of Eden on the PS3 because I think that'd be awesome.

58:50.920 --> 58:52.840
Because the Move stuff it seemed to work really well.

58:52.840 --> 58:54.440
Kinect sometimes is just kind of eh.

58:54.440 --> 58:56.240
But you know the dancing games are pretty awesome.

58:56.240 --> 58:58.960
I mean I just can't really see myself playing.

58:58.960 --> 59:00.160
It's becoming a one trick pony.

59:00.160 --> 59:02.300
It's nothing but the dancing games that are remarkable.

59:02.300 --> 59:03.300
You know.

59:03.300 --> 59:04.300
Yeah.

59:04.300 --> 59:05.300
Kinda.

59:05.300 --> 59:06.300
Kinda.

59:06.300 --> 59:09.040
And a lot of the games unfortunately I think for not so much with the Move because a lot

59:09.040 --> 59:12.320
of people are developing stuff for the Move kind of do stuff with the Wii and they've

59:12.320 --> 59:16.400
kind of gotten over that phase of hey look we make it you know where you can waggle to

59:16.400 --> 59:18.300
do different things instead of pushing a button.

59:18.300 --> 59:21.600
But how is the Kinect evolved a year later.

59:21.600 --> 59:24.640
Like what are we seeing on the Kinect now that we didn't see a year ago.

59:24.640 --> 59:25.640
Well.

59:25.640 --> 59:26.640
Child of Eden.

59:26.640 --> 59:27.920
And sequel saw the shit from last year.

59:27.920 --> 59:31.320
I wouldn't even call Child of Eden that new because it's just an on rail shooter basically.

59:31.320 --> 59:32.320
Yeah but it was.

59:32.320 --> 59:33.320
There's plenty of those.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.840
It was a type of game we didn't have last year.

59:35.840 --> 59:39.840
But like has Kinect really changed gaming.

59:39.840 --> 59:44.960
No and even the stuff that Microsoft is touting is kind of like oh look see we're gonna integrate

59:44.960 --> 59:49.880
Kinect into these games and it's gonna be really unique and you know the head tracking

59:49.880 --> 59:50.880
and stuff like that.

59:50.880 --> 59:52.720
Okay the head tracking in Forza 4 is kinda neat.

59:52.720 --> 59:55.720
I don't know if it works really well but it's a neat idea.

59:55.720 --> 01:00:00.840
What they used it for Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition is stupid.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:05.040
Oh look at me I can actually use the voice command to switch between old graphics and

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040
new graphics.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040
Who gives a fuck.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.040
I mean that is stupid.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.960
Why would I need to do that on the fly.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.760
Or why would I need to yell grenade when I can push a button and it does grenade.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.260
I mean it's dumb.

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:21.640
So you know if they had head tracking or something like that for Halo that'd be kinda cool where

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.760
you'd like you get if you move in your head it moves the camera slightly so that there's

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.320
a little bit more integration there.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.720
I mean that could be really cool.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.840
I mean they're just unfortunately the head tracking stuff that they're doing like with

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.400
a Forza 4 even like looking left and right that doesn't work.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.720
I mean if you're moving your head a little bit and it's tracking your head and it changes

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.680
the camera's perspective based on where your head is that's kinda cool cause that's a little

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.720
bit of immersion there but I don't know some of the stuff that they're doing right now

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.720
is kinda useless.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.680
But yeah there's tons of dancing games.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.320
There's tons of sports games.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:59.600
There's you know just stuff you don't really I don't know dancing and sports games is pretty

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.440
much it.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.040
Well PlayStation 3 is gaining a little ground and I gotta admit like I don't wanna blame

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:11.240
the hack for this but I don't know what to put my finger on it with but I gotta say like

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.880
all these games I've been buying lately if they exist versions on the PlayStation 3 and

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.120
the 360 I've been getting them on the PS3 now.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.520
Like I used to buy the 360 versions because multiplayer was so much better on 360 and

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.760
I have more people on my friends list over there but I haven't been buying a lot of multiplayer

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.640
games lately and I don't play that many games online so like Arkham City I have on PS3.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.440
Disney Universe I got on PS3.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.880
Dance Central well obviously that's only an Xbox game so that's what I'm using my Xbox

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:46.520
for right now but I gotta admit I can't put my finger on it but I've just been more drawn

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:49.460
to my PS3 lately owning both.

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:58.040
So this news doesn't really surprise me it's the better controller I think that weighs

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.080
a lot more than you think by the way Skyrim pre-ordered on PS3.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:07.200
I do actually have to say that the PS3 controller is actually just slightly a bit more comfortable

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.120
for my injured hand.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:15.000
I hate that Microsoft does not change that goddamn hideous D-pad outside of special edition

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.680
bullshit that doesn't count.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:21.960
The D-pads alright and even the special edition stuff didn't really help but eh the controllers

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960
are alright.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:29.360
I mean I don't really give a crap about the or I don't really care for the convex trigger

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:34.280
buttons that are on the Playstation 3 but who cares you know it doesn't really stop

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.600
me from playing different games on these consoles.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.440
Really I don't play anything on the PS3 real uh you know if I'm gonna buy a game it's because

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:49.920
well I don't really play with a lot of people on the PS3 online it's just I just don't do

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.920
it.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:55.120
It's just too bad because I've got a lot of games that I have on the PS3 that I haven't

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.120
played yet.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:00.280
Going to Salacious Pop in our chat room at chat.orangelandtrader.com Salacious Pop says

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.960
Kinect has actually turned out to be a great utility for special needs people the deaf

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.880
mobility issues whatever but as a household hardcore entertainment device I don't think

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:12.400
it really succeeded but the technology is really important in my opinion the blind not

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.960
the deaf he meant to say.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:20.560
I get that and that's great and I do think the Kinect has made a lot of progress for

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.440
like you know accessibility issues has had a lot of the iOS stuff that's come out lately

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:32.200
um like Siri and all that but that's not what Microsoft's selling it as I kind of feel like

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:39.280
Microsoft hasn't delivered on what they promised it to us at that's great but just because

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:45.160
you know that happens to be a great perk about it doesn't mean that you know Microsoft's

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:51.240
really delivered on their promise of changing gaming you know I don't know.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.760
All right anyhow I guess we'll move on to some more news Dark Sakura.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:59.480
Well how about something about the 3DS that might be good news?

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.760
Super Mario 3D Land it's actually already out in Japan I believe and they say that it's

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:11.280
got new firmware for the system and it's basically supposed to make your friend list more functional

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:17.480
so you can join in a friend's game that's already in progress just with pressing a button

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:27.280
and it's actually just a brand new firmware as opposed to the scheduled one I think.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.800
So now the 3DS is caught up to only being about six years behind in online gaming technology

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.800
with this new firmware.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.800
Something like that.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.320
Well it's good to see them making progress forward.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:41.560
Yeah a little progress but they're not sure if it's gonna be out for the US one but they're

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.640
still waiting on hearing from Nintendo.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.640
All right.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.640
I would think it would be.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:52.640
It is gonna be on the US one thanks to reviewers of the US copy already and not only does it

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.640
do all that fancy stuff it of course stops.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.640
Well of course.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.640
Piracy.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:03.280
You betcha that Skyward Sword on the Wii when is that out by the way is that out today or

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.280
is that next week?

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.280
No.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.280
That's awhile.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.280
Is it?

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.280
I thought it was like soon.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.280
A few more weeks.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.280
Actually I think it's Sunday.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.280
Two weeks from today.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.600
It's only like three weeks until Thanksgiving so it's gotta be the 20th.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.840
You know Skyward Sword is gonna patch up how we all hacked our Wii's to play Xenoblade.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.840
No.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:21.840
You don't think so?

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:22.840
No.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.840
Really?

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.840
Yeah.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.840
Why is that?

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.800
Because those patches don't mean crap.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.600
The way they're getting in is not something you can patch out?

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600
No.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.240
You can take the patches off of those disks.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.140
Oh I see what you mean.

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:39.720
So in other words.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:46.120
But if somebody who buys it and just installs it as it is might get their stuff overwritten.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.400
Well yeah I mean if you connect to even a system update stuff you're gonna get those

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.080
but I don't think any of that's gonna really matter.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:06:01.360
Usually they could I guess do that but I don't think that they're going to.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:06.200
In fact I'm just kind of curious here.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200
Just to see.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.840
I'm wondering if Skyward Sword's already leaked out because.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:15.840
Well on top of that even if it's not like people aren't going to find another way.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.800
So I don't think it's leaked.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.480
It's just one of those things I think is interesting that's all.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.480
Yeah I mean they could.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.840
I mean that'd be a good game for them to do it on.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.320
I just to be honest though.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.320
The PSP did that a lot.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:30.200
To be honest with you Rob I don't think they give a shit anymore.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.960
I just think I don't think they I don't think they care.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.440
I think at this point they're like okay well we've done well I don't know we got a story

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.440
coming up I don't know.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.440
I don't know Loki we'll see.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.200
I think they're already moved on to the Wii U.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.720
We'll talk more about it when we get there.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:45.520
I think you're wrong but we'll we'll I and I was surprised to hear it too but let's let's

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.760
move on with the release dates.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:51.600
We're going to travel around the world and check out what is coming out to a store near

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.560
you and as it is early November there's going to be a lot right Loki.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560
Of course.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:02.840
And as I was telling you before how Activision gets behind really stupid toys toy things

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:03.880
for the DS.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:05.940
We have two of them actually coming out today.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:10.720
Moshi Monsters Moshelin Zoo on Nintendo DS and Lala Loopsie.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720
What?

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.200
Yes I don't understand what they are but hey.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.760
Wasn't Lala Loopsie one of the Tinky Winky or one of the Teletubbies?

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.680
No it's not Teletubby.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.680
Lala was a Teletubby.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.680
Why do I know that?

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.680
Why do you know that?

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.680
I don't know why I know that.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:30.640
This is my head full of random trivia but yeah so that is some weird toy that's popular

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.640
nowadays.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.640
Some loop doll things.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.640
I don't know.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.640
Whatever.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.600
Anyways let's cheer for Xbox 360 and Kinect.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.040
There's a game that's for Kinect.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:47.360

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:54.300
It's hilarious, a little bit of trivia here.

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.720
This game is like one of the only games this company is making.

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.100
It's been delayed for four years.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.100
Four years.

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:05.600
And literally up till the last minute it keeps getting delayed.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.000
Although they claim it's actually going to release this week.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
The hell's the problem?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.160
It's just a stupid card game.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.480
I don't understand how you develop a card game for four years.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.480
It's one guy.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.120
And it's a port of a Game Boy Advance game which is hilarious.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.760
One guy working there.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.760

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.480
you know, the Wii's dying down a little bit.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.520
But on the Nintendo 3DS, Driver Renegade 3D in Japan this week, as well as Jewel Pets

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.320
Magic Rhythm Da Yeah!

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.320
That's really the name.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.320
Da Yeah!

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.640
Da Yeah!

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.880
It's coming out this week.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:44.720
And it is, the box is about as fucking pink as a box can get.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.960
But my favorite thing about this box is that you have all these cuddly, wuddy little characters,

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.960
right?

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:50.960
But then look at this.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:54.160
That's an angry fucking cheetah over there on the left.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.480
Like, why are all these bitches crowding in my space?

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.760
That would devilize, man.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.520
They got the creepy red eyes there.

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:05.320
This cheetah wants nothing to do with the rest of this cute fuckery that's going on

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.160
in the rest of the picture.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.000
Can you put that on the Tumblr if I link you to that?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.280
Yeah.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.760
Orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:19.880
Well, if you don't want to, DarkSaucer, I don't know if you should do it.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.880
Do it!

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.040
Put that on the Tumblr so listeners can see that.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.080
I love angry cheetah.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.360
Da Yeah!

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.360
But cheetah's saying...

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.840
The damn thing will ever pull up.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.480
Cheetah's saying Da No.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:37.800
Alright, on the Sony PSP, oh no, I already read PSP, derp derp.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.880
That's it this week for releases then.

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.960
That's really it.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.200
The Vita to look forward to on December 17th, though, in Japan, remember, they're getting

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.200
it this year.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:51.480
Before you get to Tumblr, how about the UK release date, StarSakura?

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.640
Well, give me a second.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:03.120
Okay, on the 8th, we have Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, blah.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:09.560
On the 9th, there's Fighting Fantasy The Warlock of Firetop Mountain, Peggle on PSP, and Premier

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:10.920
Manager 2012.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:17.460
On the 11th, we have Cave Story 3D, LA Noire The Complete Edition, Michael Jackson Experience,

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:25.000
My Self-Defense Coach, and Shinobi, Black Eyed Peas Experience, who gives a shit, Skyrim

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:33.240
on 360 PC, PlayStation 3, Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012, and that's it.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:36.000
Now I'm gonna post stuff on angry cheetah.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Angry cheetah?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Yeah.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Alright.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
I'm just saying.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Alright.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Moving on.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.160
Just a couple more news stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the classic game of

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.160
the week.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.440
And again, I'll say this about the classic game of the week, it was one of those things

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:52.320
where when I saw what it was, because, you know, I co-host the show, I get to see what

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.760
it is before we start, I went, really?

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.360
We've never done that one before?

01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:00.280
And sure enough, it's one of those games, like, this is a true fucking classic and it's

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.160
not on the list of games we've done before.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.160
Go fig.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.240
But, a couple more news stories first.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.240
Loki?

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.240
Uh, yes.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.960
So Nintendo, of course, they have a lot of patents for weird shit for the Wii and other

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.080
systems.

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:20.160
This one is a device that's basically a touchpad attachment and looks as stupid as it pretty

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.160
much could get.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:28.080
It's basically this thing that looks like a periscope, and it would attach to the bottom

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:36.400
of, or actually it looks like the top of the Wii remote, somehow, and you would, I guess,

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:44.240
interact with the Wiimote's IR sensor using, it would detect where your fingers are using

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:50.960
this like mirror thing, almost like using the infrared camera that's in the remote as

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.360
like some sort of camera for your finger positions.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.600
So think of it like, you know, instead of looking at the infrared lights that are on

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:02.100
the little sensor bar, it looks at your fingers.

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:09.160
But it looks so stupid, like so, so very stupid, but neat, I guess?

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:12.520
I don't really know what this would be used for.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.560
They're saying that it describes like a mouse pointer or something like that, but man, it

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560
looks so stupid!

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560
I mean, seriously.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:22.880
Well, but this, this, not ergonomically friendly at all.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.800
This means that something's in the works for Nintendo that isn't Wii U, or is it?

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.480
I, well this, I guess, because the Wii U's gonna be the same controller, so maybe it

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.480
is, who knows?

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.520
It could be, but it looks like it folds down too, like so you don't have to use it all

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:42.360
the time, but man, you know, that's kind of neat that you can use it as like a touchpad,

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:46.680
but at the same time, I mean, the Wii remote navigates those menus just fine.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.000
I don't think we really need to add more to it.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.360
No.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:58.980
Alright, well, also speaking of the Wii, and this is what I was referring to earlier, Loki,

01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:04.000
when I said, I don't know, they're swearing that there's more coming for the Wii.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.820
Reggie Fils-Aime was actually on record this week saying that Zelda Skyward Sword is not

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:12.180
the last great game on the Wii.

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:18.160
In an interview with a Brazilian site, which was posted on the internet, he was asked the

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.600
question, what's next for the Wii after Skyward Sword?

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.700
And he said, more good games.

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:27.200
Many people ask me if Zelda Skyward Sword is the last great game for the Wii, and the

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.680
answer is no.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.360
Let's talk about upcoming games for the Wii in late December or early January, cough cough,

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:36.480
after the holiday shopping season.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.480
Let's talk about that.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.480
This, okay, this could be just fucking fluff.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:45.140
Like it could be like whoopty shit Mario Tennis 27 or something, you know?

01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:46.140
Like of course.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:47.140
What's he gonna say?

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:52.340
Sadly, we don't have any good games coming out, but we do have some great filler.

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:56.920
Let's talk about, you know, thank you Reggie, let's talk about what's coming out in December

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.960
and January, shall we?

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.720
That's a great discussion topic right there.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.240
Let's talk about what's coming out on the Wii.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:07.720
We have The Adventures of Tintin, a tie-in game to an animated movie.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.720
No one curr.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.720
Hey, the French love Tintin.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:11.720
And then we have...

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:12.720
No one curr.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.480
Then we have, of course, the game from Nintendo themselves, Fortune Street, basically like

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:22.540
Mario Party, but with the Dragon Quest characters and the Mario characters in there.

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:25.560
Not really a game that people would even be looking for.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:29.560
So in January, as far as I'm aware, eh, nothing.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:36.580
So I mean, I'm sure there's some games coming out or something, but not anything notable.

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:37.580
For the Wii.

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:38.960
3DS maybe, but the Wii, no.

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:39.960
No, not even the 3DS.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.960
I don't think...

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:46.060
Well, Mario Kart 7 for the 3DS, and then I also think that they have a version of Adventures

01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:47.060
of Tintin.

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:52.240
Actually, if you give me a couple seconds here, I can tell you exactly what's coming

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.240
out.

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:55.720
1,000 to 1,000.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.800
Literally a second there.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:03.440
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom says, I haven't bought a game on the Wii in four years.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.760
ActDeaf says, I care about Tintin.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.520
Yay for you.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:10.040
This is me giving a fuck for you right now.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.280
Tintin is awesome.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:18.160
TechNist in our chatroom says, it's not the last, it's the only great game.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.160
Just saying.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.160
Yeah, I mean, it's...

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.560
Thank you, SSJ100Matt.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:27.160
I'm throwing shade at Tintin, it has nothing to do with the movie.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.200
It's just, you know the game is not going to be anything to scream about.

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.200
Let's be real.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.400
How often are movie games that good, right?

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400
Thank you.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400
They're not very good.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400
Okay.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:41.160
Now, Alpha Kinetogram brings up a good point.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.680
You're throwing shade at all this December and January stuff, but he said, let's meet

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.760
up in December or January and then we'll talk.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:55.240
Meaning that maybe they're announcing more plans in December for what's coming in January,

01:21:55.240 --> 01:22:01.600
which a lot of people are taking to mean, OMG, it's Last Story and Xenoblade and Pandora's

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:08.680
Tower, which you said on this show like four months ago is what would happen.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:11.920
That despite the fact that they're saying, no, the games aren't coming now, they're going

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.360
to come out and be America's fucking savior.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:21.800
Well, I thought they were going to do that at, you know, at like E3 or something.

01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:26.200
Oh, I'm sorry, 3DS also had Dr. Lorak in the Forgotten Knights.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.520
There's a Dr. Lorak game coming on 3DS?

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:29.520
Dr. Lorak.

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.520
Oh, Dr. Lorak.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:34.440
Dr. Lorak and the complete knockoff of Professor Layton.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:38.600
Oh, and National Geographic Challenge, my mistake.

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:39.600
The Wii is saved.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.040
The Wii is saved.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:47.400
Speaking of release dates, Nintendo is on record that they are purposely holding back

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.840
some of their upcoming 3DS games.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.940
They're going to be releasing them in 2012 because it will maximize sales.

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:55.920
This actually makes sense though, to be honest.

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.620
Like you don't want to release everything right now because then the games are all diluted

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:00.620
or whatever.

01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:01.620
Oh, that's awesome.

01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:05.280
I can't wait for what other Nintendo 64 game they're going to fucking port over to the

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.280
3DS.

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:11.240
Well now hold on, hold on, because we know there's Luigi's Mansion 2, we know there's

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.280
the Kid Icarus game that they showed off.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.700
Yes, Kid Icarus is coming.

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:18.360
And then wasn't there another big one that they had announced that got pushed back?

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.120
Who gives a crap about Luigi's Mansion?

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:22.640
The first one was kind of, ew.

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.320
I don't know, kind of looks cool, I don't know.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.320
I won't spend $30 on it.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:30.000
The only cool part was when you ran into the shadow that looked like it was hanging Luigi.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.760
Well maybe they've incorporated elements of Silent Hill and Luigi will be horribly murdered

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.620
by some of the ghosts.

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:37.620
Somebody can dream anyway.

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:38.920
I'd pay for that.

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.320
Let me read you the quote here.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.920
You want to hear something funny?

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:47.680
There is absolutely no Wii games announced for January at this point.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:51.320
Alright, let me see here.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.480
For us to provide software titles one after another, one idea is, isn't it possible for

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:59.320
Nintendo to stock some of its software titles instead of launching them as soon as the development

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.540
is completed?

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:04.320
Video games need to stay fresh, so it is not practical for us to put them on hold for too

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:08.000
long, but we think that some of them may be held for a certain amount of time so that

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.960
there will be a short interval between when they are completed and when they are launched.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.960
We are taking on this sort of challenge for the Nintendo 3DS.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:19.280
For example, when we look at the software lineup for the year-end sales season, it is

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:23.600
so dense that if we added any more software, the total sales would not increase.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.840
Accordingly, we have intentionally delayed the launch of some software titles to early

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:28.840
next year.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.800
Again, I'm not surprised by this.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.300
That's the strategy.

01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:37.800
Most people buy the game the week it comes out or they don't buy it at all or they buy

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.800
it used.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.280
What, Loki?

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:45.120
I'm... whatever.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.020
I don't see that they're gonna have any big... it's gonna be something retarded.

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:50.020
I'm sorry.

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:54.200
That they're gonna put out, you know, it's like... it's their next... their last big

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.200
game.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.280
And you know what?

01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.460
It's really not gonna be their last big game because if it's really, really, really good,

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:02.180
they're gonna fuckin' port that shit to the Wii U.

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.180
True.

01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:07.360
Like they did with Zelda Twilight Princess.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:12.800
So I mean, I don't know, yeah, okay, Nintendo's got a few games coming out, but I don't think

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:18.640
it's gonna be anything like, oh my god, this is the greatest game I've ever played.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.000
Still though, I gotta say, again, I've played Xenoblade, and it is pretty good, and it is

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.240
ridiculous that that game is not out in the US.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.240
There's no reason it shouldn't be out here.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:31.980
There's a lot of games that they localized for Europe regions that... there was the one

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:38.560
it was Disaster Day in Crisis or something like that, that came out over in Japan, and

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.080
it came out over in Europe, and they completely localized it, and it was Nintendo published,

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.840
and they just... nah, we're not gonna bring it over here.

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.920
Let me ask this question.

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:50.720
I don't think this is something anyone's talking about, or at least if they are, I haven't

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.620
read it.

01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:55.900
With all the talk about Nintendo's losses and so forth, do you think someone's about

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:57.840
to get ousted?

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:02.120
Do you think that we might see that Iwata gets thrown out, or Reggie Fils-Aime?

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:03.120
No?

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.120
No.

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.120
You don't think so?

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.120
Because a lot of this stuff... some bad decisions.

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.280
Not porting these games I think could be seen as a bad decision.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.840
The shareholders?

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.280
Very pissed off that they won't make iPhone games.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:20.320
But here's the problem though, who gives a fuck what the shareholders want?

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.320
They're stupid, okay?

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.320
I mean, no!

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.320
No, no, no, hold on.

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:24.320
Loki!

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.320
Do you hear what you're saying?

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:30.200
I mean, seriously, they sound like stupid fucking fanboys that are like, why aren't

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.520
you making Mario games for the Xbox 360?

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:35.040
I don't like you!

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:42.040
I mean, sorry, it's stupid to think that they should make games for their competitor, basically.

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.720
Yes, let me help my competition.

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.000
Let's give people more reasons not to buy our systems.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.520
We're gonna put our games on other systems.

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.520
That's stupid.

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:57.920
And I'm sorry that... the real answer is, though, if the Wii U sucks, Nintendo's gonna

01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.680
go the way of Sega.

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.120
They're not gonna go the way of Sega.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.760
They're gonna lay low for a while and they're gonna come out with another system.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:08.320
They're gonna go the way they did with, like, the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube, where it

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.280
just didn't do that hot.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.640
It'll survive.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:14.560
People will buy it, because people eat up gimmicks.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:18.480
That's why Skylanders is doing alright, because people eat up gimmicks.

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:24.640
And by doing well, I mean they've sold 20,000 copies per platform, which is not very well.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.200
But I don't know.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.040
I think, though, it's stupid if their shareholders want them to make iPhone games.

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.320
It's not stupid that they shouldn't have, you know, some cheaper priced games on their

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.380
marketplace to drive sales that way.

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:43.360
And yeah, I do think they should get into a market where they have some, you know, 99

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:46.120
cent games, because I think that's what people eat up.

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.960
And they're more likely to purchase that stuff.

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:55.940
Yeah the quality might not be as good as your Nintendo games, but I think that they're okay.

01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:56.940
And you know what?

01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.680
Some people like Angry Birds.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.720
Actually, a lot of people like Angry Birds and that kind of stuff, and those are 99 cent

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:03.720
games.

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.800
Or even like Fruit, you know, Fruit Ninja.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.180
Simple concept stuff that doesn't take much to develop and you sell it for a cheap price

01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:14.660
and people get addicted to that shit, and you sell tons of download content.

01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:20.400
But I think it's stupid for them to be expected to make iOS games.

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.600
That's just dumb.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.000
But yeah, I could see them maybe coming out with some good games.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.320
I don't, honestly, the bring over, the last story and stuff like that, even though it's

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.600
sometimes like, oh man, this is gonna do really well.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:34.240
All these hardcore fans are really into, you know, these games.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.480
I think they missed the boat.

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.480
I don't know.

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.360
I think that they've seen what, you know, these companies, like Mad World and stuff

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.040
like that, these games that are appealing to the hardcore crowd, and they just don't

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:49.160
make sense for them to bring over, because to publish them, it's just, it's expensive

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.160
to bring it over here.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:55.660
Now, at the same time, I don't know why they've brought over some of the Dragon Quest games

01:28:55.660 --> 01:29:00.100
and stuff like that, because I think those are appealing to a hardcore audience, but

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:03.940
I don't think they sell that well, I mean, they're not selling millions of copies of

01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:04.940
these things.

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:08.880
All right, well, we're gonna close with this thought here from our chatroom at chat.orangesonstrated.com.

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.680
Kaijuto says, Nintendo has been in the game too long to fall.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.440
They'll be back.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.440
We'll see.

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:16.440
All right.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:19.680
Ironically enough, we're gonna lead into the classic game of the week, which was picked

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.160
before tonight's show.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.160
Just keep that in mind.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:30.960
A time when gaming life was simpler and, you know, we didn't have all this talk and podcasts

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:35.480
that would be cynical about what the shareholders want and all that stuff for these companies.

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.760
We just play games.

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.700
When we were still in high school and would hide in our room and play it all day.

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:46.400
So Dark Sakura, when you were in high school, what game did you go in and play all day?

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:50.600
Super Mario World, which I was so surprised we haven't done before.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:51.600
I could have swore we did.

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.600
I thought we did too.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:57.280
It did Super Mario World 2, which was Mario's Island, wasn't it?

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.280
Yes.

01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.880
Which was not nearly as fun as this one.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.880
Yoshi's Island.

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:01.880
Yoshi's Island.

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:02.880
It was all right.

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:04.720
It had the stupid crying baby.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.720
That was annoying.

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:10.640
So yeah, Super Mario World is the game.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:11.640
Yay!

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:15.560
And it was subtitled as Super Mario Brothers 4 for the Japanese release.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:21.440
I kind of love this music.

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:31.360
This is my favorite music in the game.

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:37.500
This game had such great music and it was all done by Koji Kondo too, did you know that?

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:44.640
It was, of course, designed by Shigeru Miyamoto, who is the man.

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:51.260
And it's basically Mario and Luigi have to save Dinosaur Land from Bowser.

01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:57.240
And so they go all the way across these seven worlds to save Dinosaur Land.

01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:02.560
And it had different power-ups in it, like the cape, and of course you still had the

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:07.960
fire flower, and you could ride Yoshi, and Yoshi was awesome.

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:12.200
So anyway, it was pretty much, you know, you had your overworld and you could go into the

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:18.140
different levels, and you had your super mushroom, which is the other one I forgot to mention.

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:21.640
And then Yoshi had all these different powers, like if you got the different colored Yoshis,

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:26.640
like the purple Yoshi, if you swallowed a shell, he could just keep flying forever.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:31.760
And then if he was red, then every time he hit a shell, he would burp fire.

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:36.800
And then there was the yellow Yoshi, wasn't it, that had the stomp, wasn't the stomp.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:37.800
Can I interrupt for a minute?

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:38.800
Go for it.

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.160
This game is so fucking good.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.160
I know.

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:45.340
Like, like even just watching this YouTube right now, I'm like, oh my god, like so many

01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:49.600
years of my childhood playing this game are just like flowing back, like I really want

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:54.240
to just stay up all night and play this fucking game, and not go to work tomorrow.

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.240
Damn responsibility.

01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.000
I was like, I can arrange that.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.600
I know, seriously, Jamie, we need to pick a day, we need to figure out a way to stream

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:06.200
to the interwebs from your house on the TVs and all that, and just fucking play this,

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:12.560
Guardian Legend, all the fucking games we love as kids, and somehow ask people to donate

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.560
and make it a charity thing.

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:18.320
Halfway through this game, you will hear me cuss up a fucking storm because of the dirt

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:26.200
level, you know, where it has the, I call it the dirt level, when it has the shifting

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:31.560
sand, and you'll either get crushed to death or get caught in a wall or something and get

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.920
crushed to death again.

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:33.920
So yeah.

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:41.720
So anyway, basically, you also, you go to Dinosaurland and you're on vacation and Peach

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:49.920
gets kidnapped, as usual, and so they find an egg and they meet Yoshi, and they find

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:54.560
out that evil turtles have imprisoned everybody.

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:59.040
So basically, this, I mean, if you haven't played this game, get out from under the rock

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:03.600
you've been, you know, hiding under and go freaking play it, because it's awesome.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:09.880
I love the end of it, and it's mode 7-tastic via the fight with Bowser.

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:13.560
And man, there was just so much to do in this game, it was so much fun.

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:18.000
I really can't get over, and there were different ways to end each level, like, you could get

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.680
the key, and you would put the key in the keyhole, and the keyhole would get huge and

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:30.800
then eat you, and you could climb up the bean stalks like you could in the original Super

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:38.280
Mario Bros. and Mario Bros. 3, and you had the ghost houses that had the boos in them,

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:42.280
where if you turned your back to the boo, then the boo will follow you, but if you look

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.560
at him, he hides his face and he's really cute.

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:47.440
I have a Boo Mario keychain, did I tell you that?

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:51.560
It was just so much to do, this game is so much fun.

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:56.760
So let's go ahead, though, and get to how we've seen this today.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:03.200
And on top of that, I really, I know I've mentioned the music before, but you know,

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.920
Sony did the music processor for the Super Nintendo, right?

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:10.560
Yeah, you know, the Playstation was damn near the CD-ROM for the Super Nintendo.

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:11.560
Yeah.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:18.320
I really, I really think that this game makes the best use of the music synthesizer in the

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.320
system.

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:24.920
So, um, yeah, you also had the P blocks that would, you know, change your thing and change

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:28.360
the type of ending that you get, all kinds of stuff, it's so much fun.

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:30.240
And the Star Road.

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:34.560
The Star Road was sparkly and freaking hard, because you had three different ways to beat

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.040
the Star Road, too, it was crazy.

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:41.200
So yeah, so re-releases, there was, um, Super Mario All-Stars came out and it had this packaged

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:47.880
with it, which is basically the exact same version as what came on this mess anyway.

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:54.560
Um, however, a little bit of difference in it is that Luigi had his own sprite, so that's

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.560
kind of neat.

01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:04.880
Um, Super Mario World came out, um, on the Virtual Console as well, and, uh, it also

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.440
was a demo of the game that was available as one of the masterpieces in Super Smash

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.440
Bros.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.440
Brawl.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:17.240
Um, Super Mario Advance 2 Super Mario World came out and, um, it was just one player only.

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:22.000
You could still use Luigi, but it was an alternate of Mario and he could jump higher than Mario

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.540
but run slower.

01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.540
And they have voices.

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:28.280
The interesting thing, too, about Mario World 2 is that even though it was, like, so different

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:33.820
and on paper it sounds terrible that they made all these changes, it really stands on

01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:38.520
its own as another great fucking 2D game.

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.520
Like it's a-

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:40.840
It's the same game, just with a little bit of tweaks.

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.760
It's an outstanding game.

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:43.760
Yeah.

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.260
Um, and they also changed Luigi's sprites to make it a little bit closer to the Mario

01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:49.640
Advance style.

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:58.320
Um, like I said, Koji Kondo did the, um, music, um, and, uh, he also did all the variations

01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.320
on it.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:05.160
So there was, like, the Waltz version of the music that played slower in the caves, um,

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.880
the underwater version, all kinds of different ones.

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:14.520
And he basically, um, and, uh, when you ride on Yoshi, the soundtrack on the levels have

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.520
banjo drums.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.520
Did you hear that?

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:21.320
Yeah, oh yeah, you can hear it in the background right now, actually.

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:26.720
Yeah, I always thought that was awesome how, like, the music changed, depending on if you

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.720
were on Yoshi or not.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.160
Can I read a quick comment from our chat room?

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.200
Uh, it was a Tiger Claw on chat talking about Mode 7.

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:36.120
I remember when you fight Bowser at the end, he does that thing where he flies towards

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:37.120
the screen.

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:38.120
It was really cool back then.

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:39.560
So we got an early taste of Mode 7.

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:42.400
Oh yeah, that last boss fight was epic.

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:45.600
Yeah, but really easy.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.600
It was really easy.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:51.920
But, like, you spend the whole game challenge to get there, but sort of the last boss fight

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:52.920
is more of a relief.

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:53.920
Yeah.

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:57.160
I mean, and it's not a short fight.

01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.160
You just have to have good timing.

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.120
It was in multiple phases, and the part where the little thing he's riding starts bouncing

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:04.800
doesn't get kind of hard, but, I mean, yeah, at that point, like, if you're good enough

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:11.760
in the game to get to that point, then it's, um, oh, I loved the, um, Scary House music.

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:15.760
And I turned it up.

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:18.240
And the fence.

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.720
That was the others.

01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:21.720
Oh my god, I loved the fence stuff.

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:24.000
And, you know, that was in all of the commercials too, remember?

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.400
This game is so fucking good.

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:31.720
And you could punch them in the face through the fence.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:32.720
That was so awesome.

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:34.040
I loved punching them in the face.

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:35.920
Oh god, I totally forgot about the fence parts.

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.920
And then, oh, look, the flip around, flip around ones, oh my god.

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.920
I know, I know, I know.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.920
Oh my god, okay.

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:48.400
So, how about, um, we get into some of the other little stuff that has to do with this.

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.720
How about Asshole Mario?

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:51.720
You remember Asshole Mario?

01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:53.280
I remember Asshole Mario.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.760
Is there a YouTube I can pull up of that real quick?

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.760
Uh, I'm sure there is.

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.080
Yeah, it won't matter, because they won't see.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.800
You'll have to Tumblr it or something.

01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:02.680
Well, look up, though, one of the music Mario World.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:06.800
Because, um, or you can just keep playing, I don't care.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:07.800
Oh, the Thwomps.

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:08.800
Those are awesome.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:17.960
Um, okay, so Asshole Mario is basically, um, ROM hacks of, um, Super Mario World, where

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:24.520
it's not impossible, but it's freaking terrible, because you have to have perfect timing and

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:32.020
be able to, to, uh, cut out a little so short, um, but you really have to be careful and

01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:33.020
have your timing perfect.

01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:36.040
And you keep dying over and over and over again, you just have to have a million men

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.040
to get through it.

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:42.240
But, yeah, if you want to see, um, an exercise in futility, look up Asshole Mario.

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:47.960
And then, um, there's another one where people would basically have, this thing is like an

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:55.320
autoplay, is what it was called, the Mario autoplays, where they actually have, where

01:38:55.320 --> 01:39:01.420
all you do is you start the level, and Mario will start walking on his own, you basically

01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:03.480
do it through means of an autoscroll level.

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.080
Oh, that shit was funny.

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:08.800
Yeah, look up, look up, um, autoplay, I think is what it is.

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:17.000
But, um, he would, it would play rhythm along with whatever, uh, the music was in the background

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
level.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I think this is one, isn't it?

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.200
This YouTube's called Super Mario Autorun.

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:26.400
Uh, it doesn't, it has some weird music in the background, though.

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:28.400
Yeah, it's doing it to different music.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:35.400
Can you turn up just a little bit?

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:49.600
Put that on the Tumblr, so people can see that.

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.600
I will.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.280
Yeah, that's the first one I ever saw.

01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:55.300
By the way, that's what we're using Tumblr for now, is that all these little things we

01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:59.280
see during the show, that way you podcast-y listeners can go back and have it all in one

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.280
place.

01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:06.040
Yeah, but basically they'll take music and they'll set the game autoplaying to all of

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:11.760
this stuff, and just the amount of time and thought and rhythm that goes into this is

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.880
just absolutely baffling.

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.800
These people have no lives, but it's really cool.

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:20.080
S.S.J. 100 Matt linked to Asshole Mario in the chat room, so I just want to remember

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.040
how fucking terrible this is.

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.840
Um, Asshole Mario.

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:30.240
It's like you just start to feel sorry for these people after a while, because it's like,

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:36.280
oh my, you could, I swear, there's been times when I've watched those and I just want to

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.840
go, oh, I'm so sorry, oh, I'm so sorry, and then feel like crying because you can feel

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.160
like it's happening to you.

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.000
No, I'm laughing, because this stage just starts out right off the bat, Bullet Bill

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.160
in your face.

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.760
If you're not ready for it, it's going to get you.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.080
That's awesome.

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.520
It's crazy.

01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.080
Anything else that you were going to say about this?

01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:00.320
No, it's just that Super Mario World is awesome, and it's clearly created such a legacy, you

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.320
know?

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.320
Oh yeah.

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:06.960
So, I'd say it's well worthy of being our Classic Game of the Week.

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.040
If Mario 3D World is half as good as Super Mario World, it'll be a great purchase.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:13.040
For real.

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:14.040
So.

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:18.760
Alright, your Classic Game of the Week, Super Mario World, a true, true, true classic.

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:24.720
I mean, the classic, and just shocked as hell that that has never come up before, so what

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.720
a find.

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.480
Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.480
anywhere.

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480
We're not done yet.

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.480
There's still half a show to come.

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:34.120
We've got plenty of news to talk about still.

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.960
Your emails are coming up, the FUs of the Week, your Twitter topics at Twitter.com slash

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:43.060
O-L-R. Much more news in the second half of the show, including, I find this crazy, which

01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:47.000
PopCap game might they be making an arcade machine out of?

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.880
That could be something else, huh?

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:53.040
Rapid Fire News and all that fun stuff when we come back after a quick break with more

01:41:53.040 --> 01:42:00.280
of Orange Launch Radio.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.760
Welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio.

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:08.040
We are live on this Sunday evening, November the 6th of 2011, with the second half of episode

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:15.800
number 434 live tonight, as we are every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:19.680
We are on at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:20.680
show.

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:21.680
We love Bobby.

01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:26.480
He's one guy doing an NPR-ish style show, where he talks about games and has live call-ins

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.480
as well and so forth.

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.480
And one thing he was talking about-

01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.480
Except without being boring.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.480
Yeah, he's not boring.

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.480
Yeah, he's not.

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.480
Not at all.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:35.440
It's like one of those like really thrilling NPR shows, like Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:36.440
or something like that.

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.440
Does it exist?

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:38.440
Yes.

01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.440
Okay.

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.440
They have some fun podcasts.

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:41.440
You should check it out.

01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.280
But anyway, one thing that Bobby was talking about on his show tonight that I guess it's

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.680
coming up a little later in our show, so I apologize.

01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:50.320
I'm stepping on it a little bit, but maybe Loki can find another story to fill in for

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:51.320
it, because I want to talk about this.

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:53.680
And that's the Mass Effect 3 beta that came out.

01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:58.320
And I guess some things are being reported out of that whole Mass Effect 3 beta, that

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:03.160
there's going to be new modes in the game, that there's not just going to be like a normal

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.160
mode, right?

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.280
But that there'll be a mode in the game that focuses more on the combat features, and then

01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:12.820
a mode that focuses more on the RPG and dialogue features.

01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:18.040
And I got to admit, I'm not usually a Mass Effect fan, but I find that shit really exciting.

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:24.360
Like you know, combat's okay, but I'm way more into the story elements and all of that.

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:28.880
So if there's like an RPG only mode, like I'm really excited about that.

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:33.080
Loki, do you think that's good for the game, for the series or what?

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:34.080
Sure.

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.200
Probably won't pick it up anyways.

01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:37.680
You get it anyways, just because?

01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:38.840
No, I will not get it.

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:39.840
Oh, you're not going to get it.

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:40.840
Why not?

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:41.840
You're just not a fan of Mass Effect?

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.160
I'm not either, but I find that really interesting.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:50.360
I mean, and to be honest, I'm not hating because I think the games are bad, it's just again,

01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:54.800
there's only so many games that a person can play at a time, and I just never got into

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.680
Mass Effect 1 or 2 as much as other people love them.

01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:01.520
I watched somebody play 1 and I was kind of like, it doesn't really look like something

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:02.520
I'd be into.

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:06.180
And I mean, I don't know, I've enjoyed other Bioware games, I've played like Dragon Age,

01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:08.180
so who knows?

01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:12.560
Alright, well let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.360
We're going to cover some news stories really quickly because there was quite a bit of news

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:17.360
this week.

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:18.360
It is a busy time of year.

01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:20.360
Loki, we'll start with you.

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:25.760
Capcom believes that Resident Evil Revelations is going to be worth $50, and that's $10 more

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:33.280
than your regular 3DS game, in fact even Nintendo games like Super Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:35.100
7 are only going to be $40.

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:43.960
But Capcom thinks, hey you know what, Resident Evil Revelations should be $50.

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:48.080
And it will support the circle pad, which will be coming out of here later on.

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:50.000
For another $20.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:57.200
And they were quick to point out, yes you can reset your save game this time.

01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:01.680
Oh well thank you Capcom, thank you so much, that was very gracious of you to let us do

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:02.680
that.

01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.000
It's amazing why they need the extra $10.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:10.680
A true console experience on a handheld device is what Resident Evil Revelations is.

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:17.920
It's also going to be, it requires a 4GB cartridge resulting in a higher price point.

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:22.200
Yes because those extra, you know, gigabytes are more expensive.

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:28.080
You know, I don't know what cartridges cost, but I know when it comes to flash memory,

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:36.960
an extra 4GB on flash memory, 4 versus 8, like a few bucks, a couple dollars.

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:41.120
Flash memory is really cheap, Capcom, I'm not buying it.

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.120
Really I'm not buying it.

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:45.680
I'm not going to buy your game at all.

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:48.760
So, meh.

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:52.720
And of course if you're interested, it comes out in February.

01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:57.800
Of course there's going to be a new Rainbow Six game coming from Ubisoft I'm sure.

01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:04.680
Miles is probably a ways away, but Rainbow Six Patriots, outed by the new Game Informer

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:13.120
cover, is going to be kind of a game that deals with, you know, terrorism set in our

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:19.480
own country, and kind of like home grown terrorists I guess.

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:31.560
No real details, but obviously they're saying there's a lot of splits in, a lot of, the

01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:38.320
word's escaping me now, basically a lot of different narrative directions, they said.

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:45.640
Tactics and realism, they kind of go in the whole double, was it the last conviction route

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:51.920
I guess, the Splinter Cell game, more realistic and gritty, versus the last Rainbow Six game

01:46:51.920 --> 01:47:00.160
was Vegas, a little kind of over the top I think, but they still, I don't think it's

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:05.080
coming out any time soon, maybe the fall, because we still have Ghost Recon Future Soldier

01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:08.200
which is supposed to be coming out, and I don't think you'd want to compute two Tom

01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:14.440
Clancy games, but yeah I can see that coming out maybe, yeah they're saying 2013, so that's

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:19.920
still a ways away, but it looks pretty cool, I never really played any of the Rainbow Six

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:24.960
games, I did play a lot of Ghost Recon stuff, so it should be interesting to have to check

01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:25.960
it out I guess.

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:31.800
I think Dan played a little bit of that and he liked it, Rainbow Six, the last one.

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:36.080
And not surprisingly, with all the Kinect hacks out there, Microsoft is actually thinking

01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:42.680
about marketing Kinect for PC, and Kinect for Windows is going to be the new marketing

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:48.760
campaign I guess, they're actually going to be doing, it's an official website, where

01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:54.840
developers can download newly released beta 2 software development kits, and allow people

01:47:54.840 --> 01:48:01.880
to make different software and apps that will use the Kinect camera, and you know it might

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:05.320
be interesting, maybe someday, and I'm not sure if this is going to be something that's

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:11.040
in Windows 8, but maybe they're going to have a lot more integration with PCs with the Kinect,

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:15.360
maybe even so far as building in a Kinect camera into a laptop or something like that.

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:20.080
I could see that happening actually, I don't know why, but the Kinect at close range, that's

01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:24.120
the only thing, who plays the PC from far away?

01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:29.440
I understand that, but maybe they could adapt the Kinect camera to have it like, okay, there's

01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:34.340
going to be one that's like, I'm sitting in front of my laptop, versus I'm sitting 8 feet

01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:35.340
away from my laptop.

01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:36.340
Yeah, true.

01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:41.200
And for some of the accessibility reasons that SalaciousPop had brought up in a chat

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:45.660
comment earlier, I could see where Kinect getting built into the PCs would be more useful

01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:50.480
than like, what we think of in our minds right now when we think of Kinect, like Dance Central.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:51.480
You know?

01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:52.480
Yeah.

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:53.480
Yeah.

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:54.480
So.

01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:55.480
It'd be neat.

01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:57.800
Especially some of the voice commands and things like that, especially with some of

01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:03.040
the early stuff of Windows 8, where you see that it's going to have a mode that's very

01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:06.480
dashboard-like or tablet-like, I'm sure you've all seen that.

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:07.480
Yeah.

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:09.120
Gonna be interesting.

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.560
So the Kinect could control that.

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:14.800
Well, I can see, yeah, definitely, because the Kinect controls that already in the new

01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:18.720
dashboard, so they could just adapt it exactly the same way.

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:20.720
True.

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:26.620
Moving on to some other stories here, Techland has trademarked Dead World.

01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:27.620
Why is this important?

01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:29.780
Because they're the folks that made Dead Island.

01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:34.760
So immediately we're all thinking, hmm, maybe there will be a sequel to the game that just

01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:37.440
came out recently that did pretty well.

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:41.080
Did pretty well, came out at a good time, and a lot of people were into this, so going

01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:44.400
from island to the whole damn world makes a lot of sense.

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:48.600
So we'll see more on that, probably at E3 next year, if it ends up that it's legit.

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:51.000
Or maybe they're just trademarking it, just in case.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.800
You never know, but usually these things end up being the game.

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:57.120
Yeah, I would imagine that they're making a sequel to a popular game.

01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:00.840
Walmart's getting its own game magazine, which, you know, game magazines do pretty well for

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:03.640
stores if GameStop is any indication.

01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:09.440
But what's interesting is that the folks behind it is going to be EGM Media, of course, Electronic

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:10.880
Gaming Monthly.

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:13.600
The new magazine will be called Walmart Game Center.

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:17.920
They're not saying it's going to be monthly, they just say, quote, regular frequency.

01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:22.920
So maybe that's just, you know, monthly during the busy periods and twice, you know, every

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:26.480
other month or whatever during the not so busy periods, who knows.

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:30.840
It's going to have news, previews, interviews, and other exclusive stories on gaming culture

01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:32.320
and the most important game releases.

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:35.800
In other words, pretty much the same shit you can get on the internet right away.

01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:38.080
So it's making it very difficult for magazines right now.

01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:45.820
But if they can get the good exclusives and takes on gaming culture, certainly it could

01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:47.600
give GameStop some competition.

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:53.320
And although I'm not a big Walmart fan either, I'm all for giving GameStop a little competition.

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:58.320
They are going to offer this on personal computers, iPad, and Facebook with what's called the

01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:00.720
Screen Paper Publishing Platform.

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:03.200
I guess that's a proprietary thing to EGM.

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:09.800
Very interesting to me that it's not on the iPod or iOS, iPad magazine thing they have

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:11.880
now because you can get Retro Gamer now on your iPhone.

01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:12.880
Did you know that?

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:15.040
It's all part of that newsstand thing that came out in the new iOS.

01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:20.140
Granted, you have to pay five bucks an issue or whatever it costs normally on the newsstand.

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:24.680
But it is, you know, they got to adapt and get with the times and a lot of people are

01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:26.240
doing reading on their iPods and iPads.

01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:29.280
They're going to adapt and get with the times, maybe lower that price point.

01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:31.280
Yeah, that would probably be a good idea too.

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:35.800
But you know, I guess maybe Dark Sacred could tell you it takes a lot of work to put those

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:37.040
magazines together.

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.860
I could totally tell you that.

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.440
Now I think this is funny.

01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:44.200
This is a very tongue-in-cheek, very sort of game.

01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:51.520
It's an indie game that just came out on Xbox Live Indie Games and the indie game developer

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:54.320
is Ben Kane.

01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:58.520
It's called DLC Quest and I love this trailer so I'm going to play a little bit for you

01:51:58.520 --> 01:51:59.520
guys.

01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:01.420
Maybe we'll get it on the Tumblr too.

01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:04.920
Going Loud Studios put this out and here's the trailer.

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:11.000
What happens when DLC goes too far?

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
DLC Quest.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.200
The basic features are now DLC.

01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:18.200
Pausing the game?

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:20.200
DLC Quest.

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.200
Animation?

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:22.200
DLC Quest.

01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:24.200
Moving to the left.

01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:26.200
Well, that's included.

01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:28.200
No, it's not.

01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:30.200
DLC Quest.

01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:34.440
Collect coins and buy DLC.

01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:35.440
It's simple.

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:40.400
DLC means downloadable content and Quest means Quest.

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:42.400
DLC Quest.

01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:50.400
We got map packs, night map packs, sexy outfits, hats, and zombies.

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:53.400
Yeah, we even got horse armor.

01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:55.400
DLC Quest.

01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:58.400
I think there's a princess or something to rescue too.

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.400
I don't know.

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.400
**** you.

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:04.400
DLC Quest is made with satire.

01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:09.400
Satire means the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ritual to expose and criticize people's

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:10.400
stupidity.

01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:11.400
DLC Quest.

01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:12.400
Download it now.

01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:17.400
See, now, I thought that was funny.

01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:18.400
That was funny.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.400
Here's the thing.

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:23.400
The satire part is, and what you can't see unless you're actually looking at the video,

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:27.400
is that the guy is walking around collecting coins in a very Mario-esque kind of game,

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:31.900
so the quote-unquote DLC is that you're using these coins you pick up to get the ability

01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:36.400
to move to the left and get sexy princess outfits and horse armor and all this stuff.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.400
I think that's funny and it is pretty good satire.

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.400
What did you think of that, Loki?

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:41.400
I don't know if you've seen that before.

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:42.400
What?

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:43.400
It's pretty funny.

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:44.400
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.400
So, I don't know how much that costs.

01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:46.400
I didn't see...

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:47.400
Oh!

01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:48.400
80 Microsoft points.

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.400
A buck.

01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.400
Good for you, dude.

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:51.400
A whole dollar.

01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.400
I think you'll sell some copies with that.

01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:54.400
Why not?

01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:55.400
Why not?

01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:56.400
Good for you, dude.

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:57.400
All right.

01:53:57.400 --> 01:53:59.400
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:00.400
A couple things.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:05.400
Actually, new Xbox Live Arcade game is Alan Wake.

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:11.400
It's going to be available for Xbox Live Arcade and it was announced on their Facebook page.

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:12.400
It's not a sequel.

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:14.400
It is the game.

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:21.400
Also, there is a country music pack for Rock Band 3 that's got a lot of crap in it.

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:24.400
And I mean crap because I hate country music.

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:27.400
It's called Going Country Pack 5.

01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:28.400
It's Shelly Wright.

01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:31.400
Yeah, but couldn't you call stuff like Sweet Home Alabama country music?

01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:32.400
No, Southern Rock.

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:33.400
There's a difference.

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:35.400
Sorry, my bad.

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:37.400
There's some decent stuff in here.

01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:41.400
The night the lights went out of Georgia is Reba.

01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.400
There's Sugarland.

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:45.400
There's also Going Country Pack 6.

01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:48.400
That's Billy Currington, whoever the crap that is.

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:49.400
George Strait.

01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:54.400
I mean, hey, Johnny Cash, Ring of Fire, Justin Moore, who cares?

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:55.400
Going Country Pack 7.

01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:56.400
Dude, Johnny Cash.

01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:57.400
Keith Urban.

01:54:57.400 --> 01:54:59.400
Hey, Lady Antebellum.

01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:00.400
Merle Haggard.

01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:02.400
Now, Merle Haggard's pretty awesome.

01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:06.400
And Going Country Pack 8 has Dwight Yoakam and Rascal Flatts.

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:10.400
Going Country Mega Pack, all of the above, and all the other stuff I didn't say, and

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:11.400
it's 20 bucks.

01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:16.400
It almost makes you think that at some point they were gonna do a country rock band release

01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.400
and didn't end up doing it because they had like all these songs.

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:19.400
This is a lot from getting it once.

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.400
They did two country rock band track packs.

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:23.400
Yeah, they did the track packs a while ago.

01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.400
I guess maybe this is just a virtual version of that.

01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:26.400
I don't know.

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:29.400
The only one of those that I care about is Johnny Cash because Ring of Fire is awesome.

01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:33.400
Yeah, Johnny Cash, he's above country music.

01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:36.400
He's godly music.

01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:38.400
And then, you know, Ring of Fire was in the Silent Hill movie.

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.400
Yeah, but still, Ring of Fire is just a great song.

01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:43.400
I'm giving it another...

01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:45.400
I see, a little video game connection.

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:46.400
I'm wearing my Silent Hill shirt.

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.400
You are.

01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:48.400
You are.

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.400
Pyramid Head is attacking your boobies on that shirt.

01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:53.400
I've enjoyed it all day.

01:55:53.400 --> 01:56:03.400
And speaking of Silent Hill, there actually is talk that Silent Hill may be going off into different spin-offs.

01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:14.400
I haven't really said exactly what, but there's been mentions of maybe an RPG or a first-person shooter.

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:17.400
They did have that arcade game that was kind of a shooter, wasn't it?

01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:19.400
Yeah, and it was the iPhone game.

01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:22.400
I wish the iPhone game was pretty awful, but it was an early game.

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.400
I wish they would port that arcade game to, like, Xbox Live Arcade or something.

01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:32.400
They also said that Downpour, though, was never going to be a first-person shooter.

01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:41.400
The quote is, and this is coming from, let's see, Tom Hewlett, who's a senior associate producer on Silent Hill, Downpour.

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.400
It says, Downpour was never going to be an FPS.

01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:48.400
This is just the result of some overzealous fans reading too much into a posting on Vatra's website.

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:51.400
How about make Silent Hill cool again?

01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:56.400
Seriously. For Sakuriyamoka to come back. Throw a lot, a lot, a lot of money at him.

01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:58.400
That's what you could do.

01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:00.400
And grovel. Groveling helps.

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:02.400
Some comments from our chat room at chat.orangehunter.com.

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:06.400
A lot on the country pack, the dark soccer I mentioned a minute ago.

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:10.400
Brad from Pod Culture says, when is this country pack due out, or did I miss it?

01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.400
Did you save the date?

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:14.400
No, I didn't.

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:16.400
It's this upcoming week, right?

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:17.400
Yeah, I think so.

01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:21.400
So, that'll be out very, very soon. It's not like something like Way in the Future.

01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:24.400
It is, I just pulled it up. November 8th is when this is all out.

01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:29.400
Going to other comments, Legend of Zaku says, needs more achy breaky heart.

01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.400
Please no.

01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:33.400
Unless we have the Weird Al version. We need a Weird Al pack.

01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:35.400
That would be awesome, actually.

01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:38.400
He's gonna be in Oakland in a couple days, or maybe it was tonight.

01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:40.400
Ugh, damn.

01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:42.400
If there's no writing going on or all that.

01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:49.400
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, going country? Will there be other genres, like going dance, going rave?

01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:55.400
Well, as neat as that idea is, keep in mind, it is gonna have to make use of all the instruments somehow.

01:57:55.400 --> 01:58:04.400
Now, there are some songs that will exclude a keyboard or a bass, but keep in mind, it's gonna be really hard to do a dance pack.

01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:06.400
Unless it has guitars.

01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:12.400
But like, they could do like CNC Music Factory, Everybody Dance Now, because it had that...

01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:16.400
I guess they could probably get creative and figure something out. We'll see.

01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:27.400
Alright, let's move on to some more news before we get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week, and your calls pretty soon here.

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:28.400
Loki.

01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:38.400
Yes. Now, one of the features of the Playstation 3 has been to allow people the ability to share content.

01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:44.400
Or at least you can link your content that you download to up to five different PS3s.

01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:48.400
I would imagine that's if, for example, you own multiple PS3s.

01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:56.400
Or, for example, if you have a PS3 that dies and you wanna bring that content to the new PS3.

01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:58.400
And they figure that you're not probably gonna go through five PS3s.

01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:01.400
Well, people have been using that to share games.

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:05.400
So say, for example, I download a game and I can share it with four of my friends.

01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:10.400
Because they all download it to their console using that sharing feature.

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:14.400
Kind of exploiting it, if you will.

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:22.400
Well, beginning on November 18th, Playstation Network licenses can only be tied to two PS3s and two PSPs.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:28.400
Apparently, they're saying that that's gonna affect purchases made after the start date.

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:38.400
And while you'll be able to deactivate and reactivate consoles online, the days of sharing with a bunch of people is now gone.

01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:42.400
And so, honestly, I think that's fair.

01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:46.400
I mean, because people were kind of abusing it to begin with to get free games.

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:55.400
And if you can deactivate consoles, like say, for example, your console dies or whatever, and you can reactivate it on a new console, I think that's fair enough.

01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:59.400
So, yeah. Go Sony.

01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:02.400
I'm kinda not surprised. They're clamping down on it.

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:10.400
Five did seem excessive and they're probably privy to all these people that have formed these little clubs about sharing the codes and so forth, or sharing the content.

02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.400
So, I'm not too surprised.

02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:17.400
Two seems reasonable. One downstairs, one upstairs, or one in the bedroom, one in the living room.

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:21.400
Well, and the fact that you can deactivate them, too. I don't know if you could deactivate the ones when it's five.

02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:22.400
Oh, good point.

02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:25.400
So, that would be... I think that's fair.

02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:28.400
That would be good if you fry one PS3 and you have to get another one.

02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:32.400
You can add it onto that and you can deactivate it once you get the new one.

02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:33.400
Very true.

02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:37.400
So, that's good. And not too surprising that they've clamped down on that.

02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:43.400
But again, that's not retroactive, right? So, any old games you've already bought are under the five license.

02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:44.400
That's right.

02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:48.400
So, the clubs aren't really getting shut down. It's just, you know, you're not gonna be able to do it much longer.

02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:49.400
Yeah.

02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:56.400
Well, here's one of the games that you won't be sharing with five different people, which is too bad because it's gonna be a pretty big party game.

02:00:56.400 --> 02:01:00.400
Now, if you've ever played this card game at a party, you know how much fun it can be.

02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:02.400
Apples to apples. Have you ever played this?

02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:03.400
Love it.

02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:10.400
Yes. This is the game where you have a card on a green card and the green card is some type of, like, verb.

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:12.400
Like, I don't know, like...

02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:14.400
It's usually an adjective, I think.

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.400
Yeah, like an adjective. Like...

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.400
Tasty.

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:22.400
Yeah, tasty. And then the red cards all have, like, nouns on them. Like, the 90s.

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:26.400
Or the card that will always win every round, including, like, tasty.

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:29.400
You put down Helen Keller. Always wins the round, right?

02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:33.400
And then, because everybody votes on which card is the funniest for that.

02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:40.400
Well, this game is going to be coming out for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this holiday season.

02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:42.400
I'm gonna play the shit out of this.

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:47.400
CHQ is doing it and apparently they're gonna be adding this social and online connectivity.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:51.400
You're gonna be able to play this anywhere, anytime.

02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:58.400
It's gonna be interesting to see how it works because, you know, it's not gonna be the same online that it is in person, but...

02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:03.400
Or that it is drunk on pineapple malibu in the hotel room.

02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:06.400
There will be single, local, and six player online play.

02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:08.400
You're gonna have golden apple cards.

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:10.400
How do you play single player?

02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:11.400
It's kinda dumb, huh?

02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:15.400
Golden apple cards, which will be used to change the rules.

02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:18.400
There's gonna be Facebook support as well.

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:22.400
Download content. Of course, more cards and all the same stuff you saw in Uno.

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:26.400
800 Microsoft Points, $9.99 on PlayStation 3.

02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:29.400
And the game will be expanding to Facebook and so forth later on.

02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:32.400
It's one of those things where, like, God, I love the party game.

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:37.400
But online, like, if I'm not playing with friends, I don't know how this is gonna be much fun.

02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:39.400
Like, with strangers, it's gonna be stupid.

02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:41.400
You know what I mean?

02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:42.400
You know what would be awesome?

02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.400
What?

02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:45.400
Uh, what was it?

02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:47.400
Eat Poop, You Cat.

02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:50.400
Oh, yeah, God. Explain that game real quick.

02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:51.400
That's a fun game.

02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:58.400
Eat Poop, You Cat is basically, uh, visual telephone, I guess.

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:02.400
You start off by writing a phrase, and you pass it to the next person.

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:07.400
They draw a picture of that phrase, and then you basically obscure the original phrase,

02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:11.400
and the next person tries, they write a phrase based on what the drawing is,

02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:16.400
and it keeps on going from there with, you know, more drawings and phrases and so forth.

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.400
Until you get to the end, you're like, what the hell?

02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:21.400
It's really obscure.

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:23.400
It's a really fun party game, and it's pen and paper.

02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:24.400
You don't need anything else.

02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:25.400
It's great.

02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:27.400
Yes, but it'd be awesome to see.

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:29.400
It turned dirty so fast.

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:31.400
You have to do it on the DS or something where you can draw.

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:35.400
But, uh, yeah, apples to apples will be interesting.

02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:37.400
It would be cool, like, and if this is what they're talking about, I'm not sure,

02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:42.400
but, like, if the Xbox can play Facebook, that might be interesting,

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:45.400
because it'll make it way more likely that you could actually play your friends,

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:48.400
but I'm not, I don't know, I'm not giving them that much credit.

02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.400
That seems kind of complicated.

02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:53.400
But it would be really cool if they could get that to work somehow.

02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:55.400
So, there you go.

02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:57.400
Apples to apples coming soon.

02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:59.400
Let's, uh, go to our mailbag.

02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:04.400
Every week you guys send us e-mails, and Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag

02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.400
and reads them.

02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:09.400
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us e-mails.

02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:10.400
We got a few.

02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:12.400
All right, good, because we were off a week.

02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:14.400
A few.

02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:17.400
So, first off, hey guys, Molten Brown here.

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:21.400
I heard you talking about rugby games last week, and I felt I had to chime in.

02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:25.400
I've been playing rugby for six years now, and it is awesome.

02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:29.400
I am really happy with the increase in rugby games this year,

02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.400
considering how popular this sport is worldwide.

02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:37.400
Regarding the increase, I may be because the Rugby World Cup is going on right now.

02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:40.400
I would say more, but I'm not feeling well, so I'm just going to peace out.

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.400
Later, Molten Brown.

02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:43.400
Aw, feel better.

02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:45.400
I mean, rugby is awesome, don't get me wrong,

02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:47.400
but you got to admit, it is a little weird.

02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:48.400
Like, rugby doesn't quite get –

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:49.400
Violent.

02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:52.400
It's an ESPN2 sport, let's put it that way.

02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:53.400
I'm not knocking it.

02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:54.400
It's awesome.

02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:55.400
It's just, you know, not –

02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:56.400
Only in America is it an ESPN2 sport.

02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:57.400
That's true.

02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:58.400
That's very true.

02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:01.400
But it is surprising that all of a sudden all these rugby games are coming out in America,

02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:03.400
but you make a good point about the Rugby World Cup.

02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:06.400
I mean, if it's on people's minds, then they're more likely to buy the games.

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:07.400
Good point.

02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:09.400
All right, next one.

02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.400
Hey guys, have you seen this?

02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:12.400
It's dragcave.net.

02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:16.400
Some of them miss adorable dragons in someone's signature on the Jim Butcher forums.

02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:19.400
Anyway, you click on them or view them to help them hatch and grow.

02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:20.400
It has its own Wiki.

02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:23.400
I haven't had time to really look into it too much,

02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:26.400
but I'm hoping to hatch my little signature eggs.

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:29.400
Any tips if you guys have played it?

02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:31.400
It strikes me as a much nicer sort of Neopets.

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:32.400
That's from Holly.

02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:36.400
I was just about to say, I'm hearing Neopets, but interesting.

02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:39.400
So it's something you, like, put it in your signature and you get a lot of clicks

02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:41.400
and people hatch it.

02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:48.400
That's a good, um, that's a good get people on our website scheme.

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:49.400
It's kind of smart.

02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:50.400
Yeah, it is.

02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:51.400
No, I've never played it.

02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:52.400
I looked at the site.

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:53.400
It looks kind of neat, but no, I haven't tried it.

02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:54.400
Sorry.

02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:55.400
Sorry.

02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:58.400
Yeah, I can't say a whole lot on that, but I'll have to look at it.

02:05:58.400 --> 02:05:59.400
Okay.

02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:00.400
We got one from Rababa.

02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:01.400
Rababa.

02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:05.400
The paranormal pinball table is apparently free on Xbox Live Arcade this week with only

02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:09.400
a few days left when you broadcast.

02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:11.400
The pinball on PSN has had it for months.

02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:16.400
I know the narrator of the game is supposed to be a Sam Spade sound-alike, but it is clearly

02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:19.400
the actor who voices Peter Griffin on the Family Guy.

02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:20.400
Oh my.

02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:24.400
Still, it's a fun table that may be guilty of trying to do too many things at once.

02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:26.400
Apparently, let me see if I can see it.

02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:29.400
Wait, isn't Peter Griffin the creator of the show?

02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:30.400
Seth.

02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:31.400
Yeah, Peter.

02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:32.400
It's Seth MacFarlane.

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:35.400
I don't think they would have got him to do a video game.

02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:36.400
They must have sound really similar.

02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:42.400
I'm looking at the table itself, just for a moment, and it kind of seems to me like,

02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:46.400
yeah, it's trying to be sort of like Twilight Zone.

02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:48.400
Although the ramps are crazy on it.

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:49.400
Wow.

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:51.400
Yeah, I'm pissed I forgot to get this.

02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:58.400
It's probably like a knockoff of Twilight Zone versus whodunit, you know?

02:06:58.400 --> 02:06:59.400
Anyway.

02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:03.400
Okay, we have one from, I'm just, oh, it's from CD Thunder.

02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:04.400
Okay.

02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:10.400
Hello, Alara, I went to the mall recently and played in the game room for a while.

02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:12.400
During my visit, I noticed that two of my favorite games were gone.

02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:14.400
CarnEvil and House of the Dead.

02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:16.400
At least you have a game room still.

02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:18.400
Yeah, at least you have an arcade with actual games.

02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:21.400
I figured they were gone because of the sale the game room was always having.

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:22.400
The prices looked outrageous.

02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:24.400
One was going for 800 bucks.

02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:28.400
Lastly, I got a DS game with all four original Sonic the Hedgehog games on it.

02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:31.400
Keep up four original, oh, maybe Spinball.

02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:34.400
Keep up the good work, sincerely CD Thunder.

02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:36.400
Or maybe Sonic and Knuckles.

02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:37.400
Could be 3D Blast.

02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:38.400
Maybe.

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:40.400
Do you know I have two copies of that on Saturn?

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:41.400
Do you really?

02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:42.400
How funny.

02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:45.400
Yeah, the whole sale of arcade games, too.

02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:47.400
I mean, you see that, what's that place at the Metreon?

02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:49.400
Tilt was selling a bunch of games.

02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:51.400
And yeah, usually they are going to be a couple hundred dollars.

02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:56.400
I mean, keep in mind, dude, you got just a whole game console slash television

02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:01.400
slash stand-up cabinet slash fancy controller all dedicated to one game.

02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:02.400
That does cost a couple hundred bucks.

02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:03.400
You can look at Craigslist.

02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:06.400
You can find a lot of old arcade games for that kind of price.

02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:09.400
But yeah, cabinets are about that price.

02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:11.400
And the more elaborate, the more expensive.

02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:13.400
Someday when I have a house, I'll have some arcade machines.

02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:14.400
Someday.

02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:16.400
All right, so are we ready for the next email?

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:17.400
Yes.

02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:20.400
Okay, hello, OLR.

02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:22.400
Since we are near the release of Sonic Generations this Tuesday,

02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:26.400
I thought you guys would like to compare some of the music from the game.

02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:29.400
Yeah, there's remixes up.

02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:32.400
Rob, you should probably pull up this email because the remix is on here.

02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:34.400
Sure, I'll pull it up right now.

02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:39.400
But it has a classic remix of Speed Highway from Sonic Adventure,

02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:42.400
which was one of my favorite pieces of music in that game.

02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:45.400
A modernized Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone,

02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:51.400
and a classic rooftop run from Sonic Unleashed, which I think I played.

02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:54.400
Also, it's worth pointing out the 3DS version of Sonic Generations

02:08:54.400 --> 02:09:00.400
out on November 22nd has its own set of levels to make it unique.

02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:07.400
Okay, turn this up so I can hear this.

02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:12.400
I approve.

02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:14.400
I've been hearing a lot of good things about Sonic Generations.

02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:17.400
I'm just going to post this one on the Tumblr.

02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:18.400
Go for it.

02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:21.400
It's also worth pointing out the 3DS version of Sonic Generations

02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:27.400
has its own set of levels to make it unique from the PC 360 and PS3 versions.

02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:29.400
I hope you and your listeners enjoy sampling these tracks.

02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:31.400
Good day.

02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:34.400
And this comes from Full Brazilian.

02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:41.400
Ouch.

02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:45.400
Oh yeah, the Green Hill.

02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:48.400
There's a Chemical Plant.

02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:50.400
All right, last one.

02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:51.400
Chemical Plant Zone.

02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:54.400
I'll skip ahead a little bit in the song here.

02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:55.400
Whoops.

02:09:55.400 --> 02:10:02.400
Come on.

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:06.400
But I really like that Speed Highway.

02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:14.400
I want to see the gameplay.

02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:18.400
That's pretty sweet actually.

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:20.400
Yeah, I saw a little bit of it.

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:25.400
I really do want that.

02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:31.400
Because it looks like it's really going back to some of the Sonic Adventure stuff.

02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:35.400
Which Sonic Adventure is probably one of, it's on my list of favorites.

02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:37.400
Okay, I've got to be honest.

02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:40.400
I haven't been paying this game much attention because let's be real.

02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:41.400
Can we all be real for a minute?

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:44.400
Sonic's been really shitty for a long time.

02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:48.400
And, you know, like especially once Sonic 4 kind of came out and it was kind of thud.

02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:51.400
You know, like I just kind of say, oh, Sonic game.

02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.400
I'm sure it's more shit.

02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:55.400
But I got to say, I'm looking at that.

02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:58.400
That looks nice.

02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:00.400
Let me look at another.

02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:08.400
Now that I'm fucking on this, I want to see another little video here.

02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:12.400
I'm doing a tutorial here.

02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:13.400
I think this is that same area.

02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:15.400
Let me skip ahead a lot here.

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:16.400
All right.

02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:18.400
Well, I'll go ahead and read the next email if you want.

02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.400
Yeah, I'm entranced by the Sonic video.

02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:22.400
It looks pretty awesome.

02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:24.400
Yeah, because it's sort of.

02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:26.400
God, it makes me want to barf from all the motion though.

02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:33.400
It goes from like a 2.5D to a full, you know, Sonic Adventure style.

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:34.400
Yeah.

02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:37.400
Really want, actually you know what game this makes me think of right off the bat?

02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:38.400
What?

02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:41.400
Sonic CD.

02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:43.400
With how fluid it is.

02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:44.400
I want to hear from the chat room.

02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:46.400
If you guys in chat have been playing this, is it good?

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:50.400
Like is this a Sonic game that I should be paying attention to?

02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:54.400
Or is this one of those things that looks cool, but it doesn't play so hot?

02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:56.400
It looks like it plays pretty classic though.

02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.400
All right.

02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:58.400
So shall I go ahead and give you the last two?

02:11:58.400 --> 02:11:59.400
Yes, please.

02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:00.400
Sorry, I'll close the video.

02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.400
Keep watching.

02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:02.400
I don't care.

02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:12.400
Weeks after Cliffy slammed a site for giving Gears 3 an 8.0, the big sites are running stories about gamers criticizing Uncharted 3 getting an 8 score as well.

02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:24.400
Am I off base here, or do you think the more the vocal gamers, disregarding the factors that lead to the number score, are more willing to accept a 4 out of 5 rating as being a great game over an 8 of 10 being an 80% or an 80%?

02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:28.400
Keep on Robert M.

02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:44.400
It really is a matter of numbers and perception because with a 4 out of 5, you've got that 4 so close to the top line, but then an 8 though has two more levels of gradation between it even though it is in theory the exact same rating.

02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:47.400
So I think it's just a matter of perception.

02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:49.400
People are easily swayed.

02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:51.400
Don't look at the numbers.

02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.400
Look at the content.

02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:53.400
That's what I have to say.

02:12:53.400 --> 02:13:00.400
It's ironic because one of the things I got linked to in our chat room as you're reading that email is the Metacritic for Sonic Generations.

02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:03.400
So I'm kind of taking a look at some of the scores.

02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:06.400
It has a 77 on Metacritic, which, you know, I don't...

02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:13.400
You have to really watch these websites because you're not going to necessarily agree with one or the other.

02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:15.400
But some people on here...

02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:16.400
It has 77 overall.

02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:19.400
Nobody's rated it anything higher than like an 8.5.

02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:24.400
But some folks are saying it's good, it's polished.

02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:34.400
But then some of the people that are dogging it a little bit like say it's not as good as colors, it's not very creative, and it feels like filler.

02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:38.400
And saying that it's just they're shoehorning old Sonic games.

02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:41.400
Interesting.

02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:45.400
Of course, if they want me to spend 60 bucks on it, it's got to be better than average, right?

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:47.400
So...

02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:48.400
Maybe we'll get some calls on that later.

02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:49.400
I don't know.

02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:50.400
Anything else in the mailbag?

02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:51.400
Yes, we do.

02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:52.400
Alrighty.

02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:53.400
Um...

02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:54.400
As soon as I get back to the email...

02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:57.400
Okay, um, the last one is, um, hi, OLR.

02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:00.400
It's your friendly neighborhood spazzinator.

02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:09.400
I really don't have a gaming-related topic for this week's show, but rather I was hoping that the three of you could possibly send out a happy birthday wish to a first-time listener.

02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:10.400
Nope.

02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:11.400
Yes.

02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:12.400
Alright.

02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:18.400
This is Angie, AKA Gigi, whose birthday is today. That's 11-6.

02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:22.400
I couldn't possibly ask for a better friend than her, thanks in advance.

02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:25.400
Okay, happy birthday, Gigi!

02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:26.400
Happy birthday.

02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:27.400
Happy birthday.

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:30.400
Happy birthday to you.

02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:33.400
From Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:36.400
You need to come up with an OLR birthday song.

02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:39.400
It's your birthday! Good for you!

02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:44.400
It's your birthday, here's some poo.

02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:46.400
Happy birthday, for reals.

02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:47.400
There you go.

02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:49.400
Actually, or there's this.

02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:51.400
Hold on, let me see if I can do this here.

02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:55.400
We could do happy birthday this way.

02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:57.400
Come on, play.

02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:00.400
Play, fool!

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:01.400
Oh, this is so weird.

02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:02.400
Fail.

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:04.400
I'm waiting for someone to click the freaking play button on this.

02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:05.400
Here we go.

02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:16.400
It's Happy Birthday on Mario Paint.

02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:18.400
Do you know something, Rob?

02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:19.400
I tried.

02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:20.400
Did you know something?

02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:24.400
That that song actually is still under copyright law, and that if more than 25 people perform

02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:27.400
it in public, you can be sued for public performance.

02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:29.400
Oh, well, you know what you're gonna get from me?

02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:30.400
Nothing, because I'm broke.

02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:31.400
How about some farts?

02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:32.400
Exactly.

02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:34.400
I can spare that.

02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:37.400
I have farts in your general direction.

02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:38.400
Okay, that's it.

02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:40.400
I played under 30 seconds, that's fair use.

02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:42.400
All right, that's it for the mailbag.

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:45.400
Send us emails, we'll read your emails, and I guess now we'll do your birthday wishes

02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:46.400
on the show.

02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:47.400
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.400
Because Jamie's nice.

02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:51.400
Again, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:55.400
Don't catch her when she's in a bad mood or she'll tell your friend, so what, it's your

02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:57.400
birthday, screw you.

02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:18.400
And maybe, just maybe, she'll mention you during a segment we call the FUs of the Week.

02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:22.400
My FU of the Week goes to the cold that I've had for the last two weeks, especially since

02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:28.400
I got sick at Disneyland.

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:37.400
And a secondary FU goes towards, um, and it's, I'm really trying to be understanding and

02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:44.500
thoughtful, but learn how to package an InDesign file, please, instead of having me have to

02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:49.520
go back and fix all of the damn work because it was not packaged properly with all the

02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:55.520
proper link syntax, oh fuck you, InDesign, fuck you so much, I love you, but fuck you.

02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:57.520
I'm done.

02:16:57.520 --> 02:16:58.520
Loki?

02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:05.520
Um, FU to Activision, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, it's always a pain in the ass every

02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:12.000
goddamn year when it launches, just with all the regulation, and this customer can't have

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:17.520
it this time, and everybody's calling and bitching, and I'm gonna sue, and blah blah

02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:24.520
blah, and yadda yadda yadda, and so, yeah, fuck you to Call of Duty.

02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:30.020
Um, my FU of the Week goes to the country fried steak I had this morning, because seriously,

02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:32.520
deep fried steak, like, what the hell's that?

02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:37.520
Um, but, um, no actually it was really good, that's why I'm giving it an FU, because, um,

02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:43.520
FU to the fact that I'll have to play, like, two hours of Damn Central 2 to work that off.

02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:47.520
FU to good tasting food being so bad for you.

02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:52.520
Alright, more news stories, and then we're gonna get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:55.520
but not just yet, we still have some more news stories.

02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:56.520
Loki?

02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:01.520
Yes, um, of course, one of the things we like to complain about is pay to unlock content,

02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:08.520
basically content that's DLC that's already on the disc, and so, one such game, the high

02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:14.520
profile game you might add, um, that has such a thing would be Gears of War 3, and of course,

02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:23.520
uh, the creator, um, Rod Ferguson, is, uh, defending why they do have, uh, pay to unlock

02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:26.520
content, or DLC that's already on the disc.

02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:27.520
Can't wait to hear this.

02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:33.520
Uh, basically saying, I love this, we're not saying everything on the disc is product,

02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:42.520
uh, the disc is another delivery mechanism, so basically their thought is that, um, because

02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:48.520
the game was actually done back in the spring, and they kinda held it until the fall, um,

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:54.520
they had already created some of this download content that was gonna be put out there, um,

02:18:54.520 --> 02:19:01.520
and basically, um, you know, uh, they wanted, the first piece of download content had some,

02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:06.520
you know, guns and maps and stuff that they needed to have, uh, the data for, for people

02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:12.520
that didn't buy it so that you could play with those people and whatnot, um, instead

02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:16.520
of just having you download all that again, they just put it on the disc to make it easier

02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:20.520
so you didn't have to download everything, but obviously going forward, any other download

02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:26.520
content will be, the entire contents will have to be downloaded, um, you know, they

02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:30.520
said, we felt it was a win-win, because no one was going, no one is going to have to

02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:37.520
download anything huge when the DLC comes out, um, but, I mean, I understand that, but

02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:42.520
I think, you know, the whole problem with people seeing this is, like, you get things

02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:46.520
like with the Catwoman DLC and stuff, where it's just, like, it's already on disc, but,

02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:51.520
you know, obviously if you didn't buy the game new, you have to pay to unlock the content.

02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:54.520
Well, you do have, like, 200 megs to download, because I just did that today.

02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:56.520
There's, it's downloading something.

02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:58.520
Okay, so that is download content.

02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:00.520
Well, okay, Katamari.

02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:01.520
Yeah, the beautiful Katamari.

02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:05.520
The beautiful Katamari had, you know, a lot of pay to unlock levels and stuff like that,

02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:10.520
and it's not, you know, it's not the first game, obviously, to have that kind of stuff,

02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:15.520
but people kind of seem insulted when, you know, there's stuff, you know, you finish

02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:19.520
it and you put it on the disc, you know, you could have just added some more content for

02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:24.520
the release game instead of just releasing what you had back in the spring and then adding

02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:28.520
some download content later on that I had to pay extra for, for stuff that's already on disc.

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.520
That's what the complaint is.

02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:37.520
One of the comments there, I think the thing is that makes it money for people is when it's on disc.

02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:43.520
We could have left it off and, you know, hey, there's, here's another disc,

02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:46.520
but they believe that they did the right thing.

02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:49.520
So, I don't know.

02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:53.520
I'm sure they're gonna make a shit ton of money anyway, you know, it doesn't even matter.

02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:57.520
But it's just, I don't know, it's just kind of frustrating, delivery mechanism.

02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:01.520
Well, I mean, Ridge Racer did it with all their music.

02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:03.520
It was all unlocked content.

02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:07.520
I remember those, you know, having the keys, Dead Rising has costumes and stuff.

02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:10.520
It's, there's a lot of games that do it.

02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:14.520
And I think it's kind of lame because you're like, you have this stuff done.

02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:19.520
It's not like the game was, I mean, I get some games are delayed or purposefully held

02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:24.520
to come out at a certain time, but not all games are like that.

02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:27.520
There's a lot of games where it's like, okay, we added some extra, you know,

02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:32.520
DLC content like the Earth Defense Force expansions were already on the disc,

02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:35.520
all those weapons, and they're charging people for it.

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:37.520
Can we take a minute to praise somebody that did it right?

02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:40.520
And that would be the folks behind Burnout Paradise.

02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:43.520
And you want to talk about combating used game sales.

02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:47.520
Well, the way you combat used game sales is to make people want to keep the game

02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:51.520
and not want to sell it back by doing regular content updates.

02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:55.520
Dude, what if you'd, instead of having, you know,

02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:58.520
people pay to unlock the additional content that's on the disc,

02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:02.520
why not slowly unlock that content over, you know, every couple months,

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:06.520
something new unlocks, give people reason to hold on to their games

02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:08.520
and not want to sell them used.

02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:12.520
What a novel idea.

02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:17.520
Or, you know, then you have also, besides the slowly unlocking content,

02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:21.520
you have some really cool download content later on that, you know,

02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:24.520
it's like, you know, people that sell their games back are like,

02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:27.520
man, man, I really need to buy that again so I can buy this download content.

02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:30.520
That's good download content if, you know,

02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:33.520
you're willing to re-buy that game to play that content.

02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:36.520
Spaznator PC in our chat room says, this begs a question, though,

02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:40.520
at which point will we have $60 for a game,

02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:43.520
and then pay additional money to unlock the whole game?

02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:45.520
How about the new Mortal Kombat game that came out?

02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:48.520
I mean, you had to pay money for the extra characters.

02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:50.520
I mean, I guess you could say that's extra or whatever.

02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:54.520
But how about Arkham City, the Catwoman stuff?

02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:57.520
I guess you could say, okay, well, the code does come with the game,

02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:00.520
but, you know, there are a bunch of trophies and story elements

02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:03.520
that if you don't have that code, you're not going to get.

02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:08.520
Or, heaven forbid, you got one of those boxes where the code is missing.

02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:10.520
Even though, I guess, Warner Brothers has a little workaround,

02:23:10.520 --> 02:23:14.520
but still, it's an awful inconvenience to the consumer.

02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:16.520
Battlefield will have the same problem?

02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:18.520
Oh, yeah.

02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:24.520
So, I mean, sure, there'll be more maps for Halo and, you know, whatever.

02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:27.520
It's amazing. If you just think of the long term,

02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:30.520
I bet you could use game sales easy

02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:33.520
by continuing to provide the regular content to keep it exciting.

02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:35.520
Arkham City, for example.

02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:38.520
You beat the game, but you haven't finished the game.

02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:40.520
There's so much more to do.

02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:42.520
Right. Let's see.

02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:45.520
There is a big show coming up in a couple weeks

02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:47.520
where they show a lot of arcade games,

02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:51.520
and one of the rumors going around about this upcoming arcade show

02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:55.520
is that Bejeweled is going to show up as an amusement title.

02:23:55.520 --> 02:23:58.520
Yeah, apparently one of the biggest casual games ever,

02:23:58.520 --> 02:24:02.520
Sega Amusements, is supposed to be showing this.

02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:06.520
Now, this could just be a huge rumor, but they are saying that Bejeweled

02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:09.520
could be just like Fruit Ninja, Infinity Blade and so forth

02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:13.520
that could be making its way from a casual game to the arcade.

02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:17.520
Here's my question. Is it going to spit out tickets?

02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:21.520
Because that seems to be the only way the games last in the arcade these days.

02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:24.520
What would you guys think of a Bejeweled arcade game?

02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:26.520
I wouldn't play it.

02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:29.520
I like Bejeweled, and if it spits out tickets,

02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:31.520
it'll be a good ticket-spitting game.

02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:33.520
I'm really sad that I'm admitting this,

02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:36.520
but otherwise would I pay to play it in the arcades?

02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:39.520
Not unless it gives me some type of experience I can't get at home,

02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:43.520
which I doubt, unless it's like, I don't know,

02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:48.520
really somehow touch-based and somehow really fun and different,

02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:51.520
but I just don't see how many ways you do Bejeweled.

02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:53.520
Don't get me wrong, Bejeweled is a great game,

02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:55.520
but is it worth 50 cents to play good?

02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:02.520
Sure. So, we'll see.

02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:05.520
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news,

02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:07.520
Dark Sakura, while I try to get the livestream up,

02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:09.520
because we crashed again. Hooray!

02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:14.520
Aw, boo. Well, LEGO Universe is going away.

02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:17.520
Aw, so sad.

02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:21.520
Because they're not getting enough players.

02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:26.520
They haven't got enough players and enough paying subscribers,

02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:31.520
so LEGO Universe is going to be closing on January 31st, 2012.

02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:36.520
And they are also going to be closing the Playwell studio,

02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:42.520
which will be laying off 115 people. Sadness.

02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:45.520
That is sad. Again, more job losses. That's sad.

02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:47.520
But I didn't even, okay, this is sad,

02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:50.520
but I didn't even realize LEGO Universe was out.

02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:52.520
It was supposed to be this big MMO, right?

02:25:52.520 --> 02:25:54.520
It came out about a year ago.

02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:56.520
Was it supposed to be out on DS or something?

02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:58.520
Like, it was supposed to be an MMO on the 3DS or something?

02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:00.520
Am I crazy?

02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:02.520
No, you're thinking of...

02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:04.520
Oh, what is it?

02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:06.520
The one that's like Grand Theft Auto.

02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:12.520
It's LEGO City Stories, which I will be buying.

02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:14.520
Ah, that's it.

02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:16.520
I will be buying LEGO City Stories.

02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:18.520
Okay, I gotta confuse LEGO City Stories.

02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:20.520
Alright.

02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:22.520
But yeah, it's basically not enough players,

02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:24.520
not enough paying people, so they can't afford to keep it open.

02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:26.520
Interesting that they didn't decide to go free to...

02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:28.520
Oh, no, they already were free to play, weren't they?

02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:30.520
Oh, bummer.

02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:32.520
And the quote says,

02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:34.520
It has not been possible to convert a satisfactory number of players

02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:36.520
to paying subscribers.

02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:38.520
In other words, ain't no one playing this.

02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:40.520
No, ain't no one paying for it.

02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:42.520
They just want to play the free stuff.

02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:44.520
Sure.

02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:46.520
They don't want to pay for content.

02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:48.520
They just want to play the free stuff.

02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:50.520
I'm curious to see if DC Universe is able to make money.

02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:52.520
That'd be interesting.

02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:54.520
Oh, I'm sure.

02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:56.520
Well, of course you have so many people that already bought it.

02:26:56.520 --> 02:26:58.520
And if you pay five bucks for it,

02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:00.520
for, like, content,

02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:02.520
you get an account upgrade.

02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:04.520
The same thing as with Star Trek Online.

02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:06.520
That's why when I start Star Trek Online,

02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:08.520
I'm automatically going in with the middle-level account.

02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:10.520
Oh, that's cool.

02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:12.520
Because you've paid for it in the past.

02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:14.520
Well, apart from, yeah, my subscription,

02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:16.520
I bought Cryptic Points

02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:18.520
so that I could get

02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:20.520
the extra uniforms

02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:22.520
and the other ship and stuff.

02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:24.520
But honestly,

02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:26.520
I haven't spent more than 20 bucks outside on that game.

02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:28.520
Just a couple more news stories for you guys,

02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:30.520
and then we're going to get into

02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:32.520
the Skype line and your Twitter topics

02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:34.520
at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, so last chance

02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:36.520
to get those in. Loki.

02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:38.520
Ah, yes. So, as we mentioned

02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:40.520
before, the Mass Effect 3

02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:42.520
beta has

02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:44.520
leaked out.

02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:46.520
Apparently, there was a private

02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:48.520
closed beta for Mass Effect 3,

02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:50.520
and somehow they kind of

02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:52.520
accidentally threw it up on there for everybody to download.

02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:54.520
And, you know, it gives

02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:56.520
people access to both

02:27:56.520 --> 02:27:58.520
single-player and multiplayer sections of the game.

02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:00.520
And, of course, because of that, there's been

02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:02.520
lots of screenshots and whatnot

02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:04.520
showing, you know, different things

02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:06.520
like origin support, multiplayer character

02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:08.520
creation, level selection,

02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:10.520
stats,

02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:12.520
you know,

02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:14.520
new user interfaces and whatnot.

02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:16.520
So, uh,

02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:18.520
neat. Of course, the game

02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:20.520
will be coming out in February.

02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:22.520
It's not February, March. I know it's

02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:24.520
spring.

02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:26.520
Lots of stuff coming out in the spring.

02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:30.520
Alright.

02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:32.520
Well, yeah, Mass Effect's going to be a huge one, though.

02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:34.520
But, oops on that leak, right?

02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:36.520
Yep. Not much.

02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:38.520
It's not really a closed beta if you put it out for everybody.

02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:40.520
Well, that was a Microsoft booboo

02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:42.520
from what I understand. Man, I would be

02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:44.520
pissed if I were them.

02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:46.520
So.

02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:48.520
Alright, moving on to

02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:50.520
one more story for you guys, and

02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:52.520
this goes back to the music games.

02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:54.520
DDR, of course, getting a new version.

02:28:54.520 --> 02:28:56.520
But they're redoing Second Mix. Remember, we talked about

02:28:56.520 --> 02:28:58.520
the new arcade mix that's going to have Second Mix inside it?

02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:00.520
Well, to celebrate Dance Dance

02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:02.520
Revolution X3 versus Second Mix,

02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:04.520
there's going to be a new

02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:06.520
Second Mix soundtrack that includes

02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:08.520
remixes. They are remixing

02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:10.520
Keep On Movin' by Y and Co.

02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:12.520
Y and Co.

02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:14.520
Put Your Faith in Me by

02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:16.520
DA's Twinkly Disco Remix.

02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:18.520
Trip Machine, the

02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:20.520
Zack Nonoglide mix, Brilliant

02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:22.520
to You, the AKBK

02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:24.520
mix, and Paranoia,

02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:26.520
the KST mix,

02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:28.520
and Love is the Power, Reborn.

02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:30.520
I don't remember a song called Love is the Power.

02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:32.520
I think it was one of the menu ones.

02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:34.520
Oh, that's why. Got it.

02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:36.520
And apparently there's going to be a special

02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:38.520
DVD that has videos

02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:40.520
for Butterfly Boom Boom Dollar

02:29:40.520 --> 02:29:42.520
and Brilliant to You. Interviews

02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:44.520
with Naoki, Yuwan,

02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:46.520
DJ Taka, Y and Co,

02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:48.520
so on and so on. That's all coming out November 30th

02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:50.520
is when the soundtrack comes out. That means the arcade

02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:52.520
game is going to be out soon. I kind of

02:29:52.520 --> 02:29:54.520
want to go play it just to play Second Mix mode.

02:29:54.520 --> 02:29:56.520
Forget these newfangled

02:29:56.520 --> 02:29:58.520
songs. You know what, Rob? What?

02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:00.520
I can hook up the Dreamcast, and we can play

02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:02.520
Second Mix. It's just not the same as

02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:04.520
Dance Battle, Rob. A pretty high-def TV.

02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:06.520
Because didn't we have a story a couple weeks ago about

02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:08.520
how they were redoing the graphics in HD

02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:10.520
and all that? And it sounded kind of neat.

02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:12.520
You know, for us super music

02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:14.520
game nerd fans, it sounded super neat. You know what?

02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:16.520
What? I completely

02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:18.520
forgot that it was on my phone, but I

02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:20.520
actually giggled in my car the

02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:22.520
other day because Love came on my iPhone.

02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:24.520
Oh, really? I forgot I had the whole

02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:26.520
Sonic Dreams CD

02:30:26.520 --> 02:30:28.520
when it came out. Nice. Very nice.

02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:30.520
Alright, yeah.

02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:32.520
In our chatroom it says, Love is the power is the ending

02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:34.520
of Second Mix, isn't it? Yeah, I think you're right. Now that you're saying it,

02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:36.520
I'm like, yeah, that sounds right.

02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:38.520
There you go. There you have it.

02:30:38.520 --> 02:30:40.520
Let's move on to the Skype line.

02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:42.520
1877 Game O-L-R

02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:44.520
or a username on Skype is

02:30:44.520 --> 02:30:46.520
OrangeLoungeRadio. We are, after all, the

02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:48.520
show where every gamer has a voice.

02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:50.520
So give us a call if you want. OrangeLoungeRadio

02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:52.520
on Skype or 1877

02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:54.520
Game O-L-R.

02:30:54.520 --> 02:30:56.520
Meanwhile, let's go

02:30:56.520 --> 02:30:58.520
to some tweets.

02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:00.520
On the Twitter, NicoNicoChan

02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:02.520
tweeted us this week at Twitter.com

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:04.520
slash O-L-R and put, Have any

02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:06.520
of you played the game Hyper

02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:08.520
Dimension Neptunia?

02:31:08.520 --> 02:31:10.520
Does this sound familiar to anyone? Yeah, it does

02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:12.520
sound familiar. It's on the PlayStation. I

02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:14.520
had to read up on it. It's on the PlayStation

02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:16.520
3 and it's kind of like,

02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:18.520
well, this is what I thought was

02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:20.520
interesting. It's the console wars

02:31:20.520 --> 02:31:22.520
as represented

02:31:22.520 --> 02:31:24.520
by female

02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:26.520
anime chicks.

02:31:26.520 --> 02:31:28.520
Yes, there's that.

02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:30.520
I didn't expect anime chicks to be female. There's two

02:31:30.520 --> 02:31:32.520
things that made me think this was very interesting

02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:34.520
and one of them was the fact that it's by the company

02:31:34.520 --> 02:31:36.520
Compile Heart

02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:38.520
which is actually the dude that used

02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:40.520
to lead Compile, I guess made this company.

02:31:40.520 --> 02:31:42.520
Now granted, he left in like 2006

02:31:42.520 --> 02:31:44.520
or something like that, but I don't know.

02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:46.520
It kind of gave me hope for like

02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:48.520
just half a second that maybe just

02:31:48.520 --> 02:31:50.520
possibly someday

02:31:50.520 --> 02:31:52.520
it could come, they could come back with

02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:54.520
they could come back

02:31:54.520 --> 02:31:56.520
with another version of the Guardian

02:31:56.520 --> 02:31:58.520
Legend. I would hope so.

02:31:58.520 --> 02:32:00.520
Or at least another

02:32:00.520 --> 02:32:02.520
Guardia game.

02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:04.520
Maybe the franchise

02:32:04.520 --> 02:32:06.520
could totally work, touched up for the

02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:08.520
modern era. Right. Yeah.

02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:10.520
So I was going to try to bring up the YouTube

02:32:10.520 --> 02:32:12.520
but we're having to deal on the podcast right

02:32:12.520 --> 02:32:14.520
now with the internet feed

02:32:14.520 --> 02:32:16.520
being down, so I can't even bring up YouTube

02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:18.520
because our internet is completely down right now. We're not even

02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:20.520
live. Live listeners can't hear us.

02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:22.520
So I'm left with nothing but Twitter because no one

02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:24.520
can call us either.

02:32:24.520 --> 02:32:26.520
So let me go to Twitter. I'm keeping an eye on it Rob.

02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:28.520
I know, thank you.

02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:30.520
Going to Surtur on the Twitter says

02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:32.520
I have a new Android phone. What are some good games?

02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:34.520
Free or money?

02:32:34.520 --> 02:32:36.520
Love OLR. Thank you.

02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:38.520
Android games. We all

02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:40.520
have iOS.

02:32:40.520 --> 02:32:42.520
I have a shitty Android

02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:44.520
so I don't play anything on there.

02:32:44.520 --> 02:32:46.520
Well I mean

02:32:46.520 --> 02:32:48.520
a lot of the games that are on iOS are also

02:32:48.520 --> 02:32:50.520
on Android so

02:32:50.520 --> 02:32:52.520
I'm sure there's

02:32:52.520 --> 02:32:54.520
pretty much a lot of stuff crosses over.

02:32:54.520 --> 02:32:56.520
I can't think of any Android

02:32:56.520 --> 02:32:58.520
specific games that

02:32:58.520 --> 02:33:00.520
I mean if you have

02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:02.520
a good enough Android phone I guess

02:33:02.520 --> 02:33:04.520
so there's also the PlayStation Suite stuff

02:33:04.520 --> 02:33:06.520
where you can play old PlayStation 1

02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:08.520
games.

02:33:08.520 --> 02:33:10.520
MNZeba on Twitter

02:33:10.520 --> 02:33:12.520
Minecraft

02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:14.520
if you're into that.

02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:16.520
That's your thing.

02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:18.520
MNZeba had sent us a tweet saying

02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:20.520
OLR I found this while I was walking

02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:22.520
around Coles. There are so many things

02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:24.520
wrong with this. I can't bring up the picture again but

02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:26.520
I actually thankfully I looked at it before

02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:28.520
we recorded

02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:30.520
tonight and it was like a picture. It was like a duck

02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:32.520
hunt game. Yeah I saw that. Did you

02:33:32.520 --> 02:33:34.520
see that? What the heck was that? It's like a duck

02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:36.520
hunt. I'm assuming

02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:38.520
it was one of those plug and play kind of style games.

02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:40.520
Yeah. Or something. It just looks

02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:42.520
derpy. It looked a little weird

02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:44.520
but not completely out of character

02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:46.520
or you know whatever for those plug and play

02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:48.520
games.

02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:52.520
Quick we need a filler topic. I need to

02:33:52.520 --> 02:33:54.520
relay a message to the chat room real quick.

02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:56.520
Is this resolved? Oh are we

02:33:56.520 --> 02:33:58.520
able to come back then? We're connected again.

02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:00.520
We're up again? We're up again.

02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:02.520
Oh we are. We are

02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:04.520
up again. We're just not on

02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:06.520
the chats.

02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:08.520
I'm not up yet. I'm showing you the

02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:10.520
chats. No we just came back on the

02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:12.520
feed.

02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:14.520
So there you go.

02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:16.520
Alright so we're coming back. Sorry

02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:18.520
podcast listeners but the fun and joy

02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:20.520
of doing live radio is that sometimes

02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:22.520
your interwebs gets all screwed up.

02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:24.520
So we were just reading through

02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:26.520
some tweets live listeners

02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:28.520
and we were on that

02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:30.520
duck hunter game that MNZeba sent us.

02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:32.520
Now I can see the picture. It says

02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:34.520
indoor outdoor duck hunting game.

02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:36.520
It is not a plug and

02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:38.520
play thing like I originally thought. I guess

02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:40.520
this thing actually launches

02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:42.520
fake ducks into the air and

02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:44.520
you can shoot them. But they say it's safe

02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:46.520
and fun. But god if you had all

02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:48.520
those projectiles going around the house

02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:50.520
wouldn't that be kind of a bad idea?

02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:52.520
I wouldn't do

02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:54.520
it inside. I wouldn't do it

02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:56.520
inside either unless you have like a huge

02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:58.520
studio empty bedroom. It makes me

02:34:58.520 --> 02:35:00.520
think though. The dishes are done

02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:02.520
man.

02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:04.520
Alright now I can go

02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:06.520
to some of these links that

02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:08.520
Tigerclaw sent us because I wasn't able to pull them up

02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:10.520
before. But on the Twitter. Twitter.com

02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:12.520
O-L-R. By the way Skype line should be back as you

02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:14.520
guys are reconnecting to the feed.

02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:16.520
1877

02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:18.520
game O-L-R or our username on Skype

02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:20.520
is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:22.520
Tigerclaw had sent us a tweet. Apparently

02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:24.520
some bandits stole six

02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:26.520
thousand copies of

02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:28.520
Modern Warfare 3.

02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:30.520
In France a truck full

02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:32.520
of copies of the game was hijacked

02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:34.520
by professional thieves.

02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:36.520
The truck was driving through southern Paris

02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:38.520
on Saturday and it was rammed by

02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:40.520
another vehicle. Two men emerged

02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:42.520
from the colliding car with knives

02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:44.520
used tear gas to

02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:46.520
subdue the driver and got

02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:48.520
away with six thousand video games

02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:50.520
which they are valuing at four hundred

02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:52.520
thousand euros. That's

02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:54.520
crazy. But apparently the game was

02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:56.520
Modern Warfare 3. So if you see

02:35:56.520 --> 02:35:58.520
some early copies on French eBay

02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:00.520
you know where it

02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:02.520
came from. French eBay

02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:04.520
get it?

02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:06.520
So

02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:08.520
there you go.

02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:10.520
No not French eBay.

02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:14.520
Alright moving

02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:16.520
on to another tweet here from Tigerclaw

02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:18.520
one more. Where in the world

02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:20.520
is Carmen Sandiego is being turned

02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:22.520
into a live action film?

02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:24.520
Is this trolling? Because

02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:26.520
seriously I clicked on this and

02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:28.520
Walden Media and

02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:32.520
Jennifer Lopez

02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:34.520
are teaming

02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:36.520
up to do Where in the World is Carmen

02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:38.520
Sandiego? Please say this

02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:40.520
is a troll post.

02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:42.520
Are you trolling us? Is this

02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:44.520
trolling on Twitter please?

02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:46.520
Walden Media

02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:48.520
they're the guys that did the

02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:50.520
Chronicles of Narnia right? Has acquired the

02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:52.520
rights to turn Where in the World is Carmen

02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:54.520
Sandiego into a live action film involving

02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:56.520
Jennifer Lopez.

02:36:56.520 --> 02:36:58.520
I guess I could see like

02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:00.520
like physically that kind of looks right

02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:02.520
but

02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:06.520
it could

02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:08.520
be an interesting movie but I wonder if they're going to

02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:10.520
make it just like a straight up kids movie.

02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:12.520
I think that's where they would go with it.

02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:14.520
You know like kind of like Inspector Gadget

02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:16.520
or something like that.

02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:18.520
I don't know. That's what I kind of think.

02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:20.520
Although I will say this

02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:22.520
if it doesn't have this as the theme song

02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:24.520
then I don't

02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:26.520
if it doesn't have this as the theme song then it doesn't

02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:30.520
count.

02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:40.520
Can you imagine

02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:42.520
Jennifer Lopez featuring

02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:44.520
Pitbull just ruining this fucking song?

02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:54.520
Alright. At a theater near you soon

02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:56.520
apparently.

02:37:56.520 --> 02:37:58.520
Alright. Again the phone number

02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:00.520
1877 game OLR username on

02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:02.520
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to

02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:04.520
give us a call. And that's all the tweets too. Let me reload

02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:06.520
just in case things came through and we had the

02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:08.520
internet downtime that we

02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:10.520
were having. Did we

02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:12.520
go down again?

02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:14.520
This is terrible. What's terrible?

02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:16.520
I looked up a little bit more

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:18.520
information on that

02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:20.520
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego thing.

02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:22.520
Here's the film's log line they say.

02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:24.520
What's a log line?

02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:26.520
I think it's like the pitch basically.

02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:28.520
When the ACME agency's

02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:30.520
greatest detective Carmen

02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:32.520
Sandiego becomes the world's greatest

02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:34.520
thief it's up to her former

02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:36.520
partner to follow her

02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:38.520
clues and track her down.

02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:40.520
Their cat and mouse game leads the partner

02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:42.520
to confront a greater mystery

02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:44.520
is Carmen really a thief or a

02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:46.520
hero?

02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:48.520
Oh great. So Carmen Sandiego may

02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:52.520
not end up even being like you know a villainous.

02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:54.520
Yeah.

02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:56.520
Exactly.

02:38:56.520 --> 02:38:58.520
Alright.

02:38:58.520 --> 02:39:00.520
That is it for

02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:04.520
the tweets tonight.

02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:06.520
I'm gonna try re-logging into Skype

02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:08.520
because some folks are telling me that they can't see

02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:10.520
us on Skype and it might be because we

02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:12.520
went down while we were on.

02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:16.520
Yay internet issues. Live radio.

02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:18.520
Do we have any last minute stories

02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:20.520
or other stories we didn't get to in the show tonight

02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:22.520
that we can fill a little time with while I try

02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:24.520
to get the Skype line working?

02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:26.520
I like pie and cake

02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:28.520
and ice cream and

02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:30.520
fire and um

02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:32.520
Okay we're up. We're getting calls. There we go.

02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:34.520
It's finally working. Hi. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:36.520
It's Shane.

02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:38.520
Hey. Shane AKA Miklatov right?

02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:40.520
Sure. What's up?

02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:42.520
Nothing. Just playing some while.

02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:44.520
Oops. I'm holding down shift and talking in vent.

02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:48.520
Who are you talking to in vent?

02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:50.520
Us talking to Todd. We're playing a dungeon.

02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:52.520
Oh I see. Even though you guys live in the same house

02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:54.520
and he's upstairs.

02:39:54.520 --> 02:39:56.520
Yeah. He's upstairs. So it makes it so I don't have to yell.

02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:58.520
I see. Alright. That's fine.

02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:00.520
Um.

02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:02.520
Anyway. What was I talking about?

02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:04.520
Was I talking about anything yet? Because I don't think I was.

02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:06.520
No. You were talking about

02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:08.520
playing WoW and then calling into the show.

02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:10.520
Oh. Yeah. I'm calling because

02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:12.520
you said I should call because of Sonic

02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:14.520
Generations. Oh yeah.

02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:16.520
Because we actually own it. Do ya? How is it?

02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:18.520
Yes. It's pretty fantastic

02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:20.520
and I want to add

02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:22.520
for a Sonic game after that

02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:24.520
but it's actually just a

02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:26.520
pretty good game. Now the Metacritic

02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:28.520
scores were kind of fair.

02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:30.520
Fairly good I guess. Not like spectacular

02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:32.520
but like it's alright. It's pretty

02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:34.520
good. It was kind of what Metacritic said. Well the thing is

02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:36.520
with you know a 77%

02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:38.520
I think you said it was

02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:40.520
that is you know

02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:42.520
average. It should be average at least

02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:44.520
if you go by like the

02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:46.520
like a school grading scale

02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:48.520
or it's well above average if you go

02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:50.520
by a regular grading scale but

02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:52.520
regardless it's a nice throwback

02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:54.520
to classic Sonic and the way that

02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:56.520
Sonic 4 was but a little bit better.

02:40:56.520 --> 02:40:58.520
Um.

02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:00.520
And

02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:02.520
the best part about it to me is

02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:04.520
all the music because

02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:06.520
like say you're playing

02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:08.520
a Sonic adventure level

02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:10.520
and you're playing as new Sonic

02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:12.520
and then you go and play as fat old Sonic

02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:14.520
it changes the music

02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:16.520
like one of them went to like a synth poppy

02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:18.520
song because obviously if you're

02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:20.520
playing on a Genesis you would not have

02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:22.520
that style CD quality music.

02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:24.520
What's the whole twist with the new and old Sonic?

02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:26.520
Like I seriously don't know. I have not been following this game.

02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:28.520
There's like some

02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:30.520
evil force and it

02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:32.520
messes up time and you get

02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:34.520
thrown around

02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:36.520
so am I correct in thinking

02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:38.520
they yet again are cashing in on

02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:40.520
nostalgic Sonic? Oh yeah

02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:42.520
because from what I was

02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:44.520
watching Todd play and it looks like

02:41:44.520 --> 02:41:46.520
the first three stages are from

02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:48.520
Sonic 1 the next three are Sonic

02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:50.520
oh no sorry the first three are Genesis

02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:52.520
era so it's Sonic 1, 2 and 3

02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:54.520
and then it's like

02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:56.520
um gosh dang it

02:41:56.520 --> 02:41:58.520
I want to say the next is Dreamcast

02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:00.520
and then the next ones

02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:02.520
after that are like the newer Sonic

02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:04.520
games. So it's like a Mario Kart game.

02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:06.520
A Mario Kart

02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:08.520
oh like you saw the old track stuff

02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:10.520
yeah yeah kind of

02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:12.520
um but seriously it's all about the

02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:14.520
music when I heard

02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:16.520
uh just random

02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:18.520
and to me awesome vocal

02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:20.520
songs from like the Sonic

02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:22.520
Dreamcast days I got really excited

02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:24.520
because I

02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:26.520
think those songs are amazing. So it's nostalgia that

02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:28.520
works for you then? Yes and I'm not

02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:30.520
even a huge fan of Sonic in the least

02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:32.520
but it is pretty

02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:34.520
neat. Alright well I'll have to check it out. Is it

02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:36.520
still 60 bucks though? Yes

02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:38.520
it is. Well off and on

02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:40.520
like um at work we had it for

02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:42.520
39 for a few days

02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:44.520
that's not as bad. Still

02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:46.520
there's too many games to play right now. I've got to play

02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:48.520
Arkham City is really good and then I

02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:50.520
play Skyrim. I have that and uh

02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:52.520
I've played it it's okay. You don't like

02:42:52.520 --> 02:42:54.520
Arkham City? What's wrong with you?

02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:56.520
It's just Batman

02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:58.520
I'd rather

02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:00.520
be playing the Uncharted. But it's goddamn Batman

02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:02.520
Alright

02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:04.520
uh anything else you want to talk about that you're

02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:06.520
doing in the gaming world?

02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:08.520
Um well I already talked about the

02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:10.520
Old Republic stuff on Horde House

02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:12.520
so. Which everybody should listen to. Hordehouse.com

02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:14.520
it's LulzyWarcraft even if

02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:16.520
you don't like Warcraft you get to hear dick and fart jokes.

02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:18.520
Yeah that's terrible

02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:20.520
um but

02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:22.520
uh

02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:24.520
Uncharted 3 like is getting

02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:26.520
I guess somewhat

02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:28.520
okay reviews not like oh my god

02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:30.520
outstanding like the second one

02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:32.520
and for when I've played of it so far

02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:34.520
I kind of agree

02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:36.520
which makes me sad because I am a huge

02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:38.520
Uncharted fan. I even have an Uncharted

02:43:38.520 --> 02:43:40.520
3 standee in my basement

02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:42.520
that I stole from work.

02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:44.520
Okay I got to know more about this. I forgot Uncharted

02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:46.520
3 was out this week. Again another freaking game

02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:48.520
I just don't have time to play.

02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:50.520
Uncharted 2 was so so so

02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:52.520
well received and had so many people

02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:54.520
excited about the third one.

02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:56.520
Oh yeah. What's the misstep for you?

02:43:56.520 --> 02:43:58.520
Why are you not feeling it? Is it because maybe it's

02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:00.520
too much more of the same or is it like did they

02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:02.520
do a change that doesn't feel right?

02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:04.520
Well I don't want to give

02:44:04.520 --> 02:44:06.520
a lot of spoilers away of course

02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:08.520
because that's mean and I don't

02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:10.520
I haven't beaten it yet so

02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:12.520
from what I've played so far which is probably about

02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:14.520
six hours

02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:16.520
um it feels like

02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:18.520
like

02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:20.520
okay the step from one to

02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:22.520
two in the series was

02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:24.520
drastic and amazing.

02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:26.520
This one feels like they took all the

02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:28.520
good parts of two and then

02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:30.520
like the combat is a little

02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:32.520
bit better if not a little bit harder

02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:34.520
um the graphics

02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:36.520
are better but the story

02:44:36.520 --> 02:44:38.520
just isn't quite

02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:40.520
there. It seems to be

02:44:40.520 --> 02:44:42.520
everybody just saying

02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:44.520
you know hey Nathan Drake why

02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:46.520
do you chase treasure? You're stupid.

02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:48.520
Okay so it's not like the

02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:50.520
story is not nearly as gripping

02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:52.520
as previously. No not at all.

02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:54.520
And they're using all these and

02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:56.520
you know the stories

02:44:56.520 --> 02:44:58.520
aren't realistic in the least

02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:00.520
and the first game had like

02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:02.520
Nazi zombie mutant things

02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:04.520
and the second game had these

02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:06.520
Aztec-y big bulky

02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:08.520
guys that drank some

02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:10.520
liquid that made them super buff

02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:12.520
but this one's using like

02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:14.520
like technology you would see in

02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:16.520
James Bond and

02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:18.520
it just isn't doing anything for me.

02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:20.520
Interesting.

02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:22.520
Speaking of James Bond didn't those GoldenEye

02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:24.520
remakes come out too this week? Yeah they

02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:26.520
did. Oh my god. Yeah. Busy week.

02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:28.520
And the PS3 one has like a

02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:30.520
move bundle that looks pretty nice.

02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:32.520
Interesting. Alright

02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:34.520
well meekles off I'm gonna let you go. Do you have

02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:36.520
any other thoughts for listeners before we get more calls?

02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:38.520
Nope. Alright.

02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:40.520
Well have fun on vent doing quests.

02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:42.520
Okay. Good times. Bye.

02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:44.520
1877 Game OLR or a username

02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:46.520
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you would

02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:48.520
like to give us a call.

02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:50.520
Some folks in chat chat.orangeloungeradio.com

02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:52.520
actdeft I think he's talking about the

02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:54.520
Sonic game in our chat room says

02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:56.520
$30 on Steam. That's not

02:45:56.520 --> 02:45:58.520
nearly as bad. That's

02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:00.520
I can check. And I wonder if during the

02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:02.520
holiday sale it'll be dirt cheap.

02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:04.520
That's the thing with Steam games. Dirt cheap during the holidays?

02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:06.520
I'm on it. Yeah I know seriously right?

02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:08.520
That's where I'm at.

02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:10.520
1877 Game OLR

02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:12.520
or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:14.520
Loki I don't know if you had a minute to

02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:16.520
look and see if there's anything last minute to talk about

02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:18.520
to help us fill time here because of our downtime.

02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:20.520
They relaunched Playstation Home.

02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:22.520
Oh yeah I forgot that was this week.

02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:24.520
So it's all fantastic now I guess.

02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:26.520
I don't know. I haven't logged in.

02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:28.520
What were they supposed to change?

02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:30.520
I heard like questing and shit now.

02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:32.520
It's like all completely redone.

02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:34.520
I mean it looks like Disneyland almost the way they have it.

02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:36.520
Don't say words that are going to make me want to

02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:38.520
download it immediately if it's not that good.

02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:40.520
It's segmented like a theme park

02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:42.520
so they've got different sections

02:46:42.520 --> 02:46:44.520
like you know a midway

02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:46.520
It's more of a sports center

02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:48.520
It's more of a Knott's Berry Farm.

02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:50.520
Yeah.

02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:52.520
Alright.

02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:54.520
So that's neat I guess.

02:46:54.520 --> 02:46:56.520
And then

02:46:56.520 --> 02:46:58.520
you know the folks that did

02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:00.520
that wonderful King's Quest

02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:02.520
The Silver Lining they're actually putting out

02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:04.520
an original game. Oh yeah

02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:06.520
I heard about that too. That sounds awesome.

02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:08.520
Cognition and it's

02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:10.520
basically an episodic detective

02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:12.520
adventure about an FBI agent

02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:14.520
who gains the power to see past events

02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:16.520
by touching any object.

02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:20.520
And of course they have a Kickstarter up to

02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:22.520
fund it and they're looking for $25,000.

02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:24.520
And you get all sorts

02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:26.520
of sweet shit if you

02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:28.520
contribute to that.

02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:34.520
And then there's a rumor

02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:36.520
that Mega Man may be coming to

02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:38.520
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:40.520
I guess there's a

02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:42.520
poster in the background of

02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:44.520
one of the levels that's inspired from

02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:46.520
an Uncanny X-Men cover

02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:48.520
and they have Mega Man

02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:50.520
on there.

02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:52.520
That was from the

02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:54.520
not the mutant massacre but the Days of

02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:56.520
Future Past.

02:47:56.520 --> 02:47:58.520
And

02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:00.520
apparently

02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:02.520
it doesn't show Mega Man as deceased

02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:04.520
or apprehended so

02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:06.520
people think

02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:08.520
maybe download content

02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:10.520
like that. That'd be a real dick move but

02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:12.520
hey whatever.

02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:14.520
They could make some extra money via download

02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:16.520
content. You know the moment they put them up for

02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:18.520
download that everyone's gonna get it.

02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:20.520
It's gonna be instant money maker cause everyone

02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:22.520
wants Mega Man. And roll.

02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:26.520
And then last but not least

02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:28.520
of course we talked

02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:30.520
a little bit about Nintendo

02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:32.520
patents earlier and now

02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:34.520
Sony has actually patented

02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:36.520
biometric controllers

02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:38.520
for, well obviously

02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:40.520
and also for the handhelds as well.

02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:42.520
And not really sure what this would be used for

02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:44.520
but kind of think of like

02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:46.520
maybe

02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:48.520
some stuff to do with

02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:50.520
maybe

02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:52.520
some of the stuff you saw with

02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:54.520
the vitality sensor

02:48:54.520 --> 02:48:56.520
or they have the Ubisoft energy thing.

02:48:56.520 --> 02:48:58.520
Basically reach your

02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:00.520
blood pressure, heart rate and that kind of

02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:02.520
stuff. So maybe for exercise programs

02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:04.520
or something like that they may have a special

02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:06.520
controller attachment for

02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:08.520
like a move controller or something like that that

02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:10.520
would feed into that so you could see

02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:12.520
if you're exercising at the

02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:14.520
right level or whatever. I just want to jump in

02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:16.520
for live listeners. It looks like we're streaming

02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:18.520
again. Once again we had an internet outage

02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:20.520
unfortunately. I really appreciate you guys

02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:22.520
sticking with us through our downtime. Again

02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:24.520
this is out of our hands.

02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:26.520
Why would we purposefully cut you guys off?

02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:28.520
That would be ridiculous.

02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:30.520
Well trust me. I've been dealing with this for

02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:32.520
the last three days and it's a pain in the ass.

02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:34.520
Playing MMO is not fun.

02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:36.520
Unfortunately we're doing our best through

02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:38.520
this. We are getting another call though. I guess people can see

02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:40.520
that we're back up even though I'm still

02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:42.520
waiting for the chat room to catch up

02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:44.520
and get us. We are getting calls again.

02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:46.520
Hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:48.520
Hi this is your friendly

02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:50.520
neighborhood Mexican. Act Deaf. Hey how you

02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:52.520
doing Act Deaf? It's good to hear from you.

02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:54.520
Yeah I'm doing pretty fine

02:49:54.520 --> 02:49:56.520
I guess. What's up? What's on your mind?

02:49:56.520 --> 02:49:58.520
First of all

02:49:58.520 --> 02:50:00.520
I want to talk about

02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:02.520
something to say about Sonic Generations

02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:04.520
on PC. I have

02:50:04.520 --> 02:50:06.520
inflated but it's cheaper

02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:08.520
on Steam. You know and

02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:10.520
we mentioned that on the show

02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:12.520
but of course you guys didn't hear it because of our

02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:14.520
downtime. But yeah it sounds like it's

02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:16.520
a more reasonable price on Steam right?

02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:20.520
Are you still there Act Deaf?

02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:22.520
Yeah I'm here.

02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:24.520
Oh okay. It sounds like it's a more reasonable price

02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:26.520
on Steam then right?

02:50:26.520 --> 02:50:28.520
Yeah it's like

02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:30.520
$3 so. So did you buy it?

02:50:30.520 --> 02:50:32.520
Yeah.

02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:34.520
Oh what do you think of Sonic

02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:36.520
Generations?

02:50:36.520 --> 02:50:38.520
Like I said I haven't played it but

02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:40.520
many people have talked pretty good about

02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:42.520
it so I may get it

02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:44.520
if it's cheaper on

02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:46.520
Steam's holiday sale.

02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:48.520
That's kind of

02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:50.520
where I'm at is that like if it's on Steam

02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:52.520
then I'm just going to wait for the Uber sale

02:50:52.520 --> 02:50:54.520
that comes later on and get it then.

02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:56.520
So we'll

02:50:56.520 --> 02:50:58.520
see. What else have you been

02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:00.520
playing lately? What have you been playing

02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:02.520
if you haven't been playing Sonic Generations?

02:51:02.520 --> 02:51:04.520
I have been playing

02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:06.520
Bastion. Oh

02:51:06.520 --> 02:51:08.520
Bastion's cool. Have you been playing that

02:51:08.520 --> 02:51:10.520
on the PC or 360 or what?

02:51:10.520 --> 02:51:12.520
Yeah PC.

02:51:12.520 --> 02:51:14.520
Right now my 360 is broken

02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:16.520
so I can't play

02:51:16.520 --> 02:51:18.520
on it so. But I

02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:20.520
remember it was they were having like a $5

02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:22.520
sale on Bastion or

02:51:22.520 --> 02:51:24.520
something like that this week on Steam.

02:51:24.520 --> 02:51:26.520
$5 I think. Nice. I got it as a gift.

02:51:26.520 --> 02:51:28.520
It's a birthday gift. Oh very

02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:30.520
cool. Well what do you think of Bastion?

02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:32.520
I haven't played it a lot

02:51:32.520 --> 02:51:34.520
but I have played

02:51:34.520 --> 02:51:36.520
it's pretty good. It's pretty

02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:38.520
addicting. It

02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:40.520
reminds me of old school Zelda

02:51:40.520 --> 02:51:42.520
or old school adventure RPGs.

02:51:42.520 --> 02:51:44.520
What do you

02:51:44.520 --> 02:51:46.520
think about that narrator

02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:48.520
that's in the game that has to talk about

02:51:48.520 --> 02:51:50.520
everything as you're playing through it?

02:51:50.520 --> 02:51:52.520
I don't know. I liked

02:51:52.520 --> 02:51:54.520
it. It's a pretty nice addition.

02:51:54.520 --> 02:51:56.520
It makes you feel like you're

02:51:56.520 --> 02:51:58.520
playing it with someone

02:51:58.520 --> 02:52:00.520
and it's

02:52:00.520 --> 02:52:02.520
telling you the story like

02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:04.520
no no I liked it. I don't know if

02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:06.520
anyone hates it or

02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:08.520
doesn't like it. It definitely is kind of

02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:10.520
one of those things where you feel like the story is unfolding

02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:12.520
as you're kind of playing it

02:52:12.520 --> 02:52:14.520
which is pretty cool.

02:52:14.520 --> 02:52:16.520
Yeah. But a lot of people

02:52:16.520 --> 02:52:18.520
say that that's also like the gimmick of the game.

02:52:18.520 --> 02:52:20.520
That's this big gimmick is that you know

02:52:20.520 --> 02:52:22.520
without the whole narrator thing it's not

02:52:22.520 --> 02:52:24.520
really a big deal.

02:52:24.520 --> 02:52:26.520
Probably.

02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:28.520
It would be

02:52:28.520 --> 02:52:30.520
pretty bland I think but yeah

02:52:30.520 --> 02:52:32.520
the narrator adds something

02:52:32.520 --> 02:52:34.520
to it that makes it more appealing.

02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:36.520
And the soundtrack to that game

02:52:36.520 --> 02:52:38.520
is great too.

02:52:38.520 --> 02:52:40.520
Yeah I may feature it on the

02:52:40.520 --> 02:52:42.520
future. I love that song segment.

02:52:42.520 --> 02:52:44.520
Oh there you go. I love that idea.

02:52:44.520 --> 02:52:46.520
Hey I got to play this for you. This is a parody that

02:52:46.520 --> 02:52:48.520
was making it's way around the internet this week. I don't know if you guys

02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:50.520
saw this but this is the Bastion

02:52:50.520 --> 02:52:52.520
narrator. Well it's not really him

02:52:52.520 --> 02:52:54.520
but somebody impersonating him doing his take

02:52:54.520 --> 02:53:20.520
on other video games.

02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:27.520
And what's funny is that that's like

02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:29.520
really what playing the game is like.

02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:31.520
Yeah.

02:53:31.520 --> 02:53:33.520
So that's a pretty good parody. I like that. Good job.

02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:35.520
I'll watch it later.

02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:37.520
It's really funny.

02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:39.520
It's on this website called Dorkly.

02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:41.520
I don't know if they're just hosting the video. No they're awesome.

02:53:41.520 --> 02:53:43.520
They put out a bunch of weird stuff like that.

02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:45.520
Nice.

02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:47.520
Awesome. Well act deaf. Anything else you want to share

02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:49.520
on the show before we let you go?

02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:51.520
Probably a question for Loki

02:53:51.520 --> 02:53:53.520
about

02:53:53.520 --> 02:53:55.520
the 360s right now.

02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:57.520
Alright. Loki?

02:53:57.520 --> 02:53:59.520
Dude

02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:01.520
is there going to be any special

02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:03.520
or price deduction for the 360?

02:54:03.520 --> 02:54:05.520
I want to get one for Christmas.

02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:07.520
So I don't know if it's going to

02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:09.520
still be $200 or it's

02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:11.520
going to get cheaper. They're not going to announce

02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:13.520
any price drops.

02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:15.520
You know if anything

02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:17.520
they just have the holiday bundles

02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:19.520
right now which you know for like a

02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:21.520
250 gigabyte system

02:54:21.520 --> 02:54:23.520
I think they've got Fable 3 and

02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:25.520
Halo Reach in there.

02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:27.520
You will see some cutthroat

02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:29.520
deals going on Black Friday as

02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:31.520
well like we're already hearing about retailers

02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:33.520
that are probably going to offer the system

02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:35.520
and it won't be a price reduction so much

02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:37.520
but like that you'll get a free $50

02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:39.520
or even a $100 gift card

02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:41.520
with the game when you buy this

02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:43.520
excuse me a $100 gift card when

02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:45.520
you buy the system and I can't remember what

02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:47.520
retailer was rumored to be doing that. Was it Toys R Us?

02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:49.520
Toys R Us says that sometimes.

02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:51.520
You know keep an eye out for those Black

02:54:51.520 --> 02:54:53.520
Friday ads because you're probably not going to see

02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:55.520
a price reduction on the system itself but

02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:57.520
you'll see these other little deals to try

02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:59.520
and get you to go buy the system there.

02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:01.520
And you know when you're talking a $100

02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:03.520
gift card that could be

02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:05.520
a pretty big thing. Of course I know

02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:07.520
you're in Mexico but you

02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:09.520
come up to California

02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:11.520
to take advantage of some of those sales

02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:13.520
sometimes right?

02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:15.520
Yeah sometimes though

02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:17.520
I get my bonus until December

02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:19.520
so you might also

02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:21.520
be able to take

02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:23.520
advantage of that. Well it

02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:25.520
may not be restricted to Black Friday

02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:27.520
you never know. Sometimes dealers

02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:29.520
want to kind of keep that movement

02:55:29.520 --> 02:55:31.520
going through the rest of the year especially

02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:33.520
retailers like Amazon

02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:35.520
Best Buy Online

02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:37.520
Target just you know try to be informed

02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:39.520
and keep an eye out. This is one of those times

02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:41.520
I would really recommend a site like CheapAssGamer

02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:43.520
because they

02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:45.520
their big niche is

02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:47.520
rounding up all these ads so

02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:49.520
keep an eye out when it's time and I'm

02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:51.520
sure somebody will be offering the deal because they're going to try

02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:53.520
they're going to try and get them out the

02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:55.520
door. Yeah I think so.

02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:57.520
We have a named chatter. I hope that

02:55:57.520 --> 02:55:59.520
there's a brief

02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:01.520
go ahead

02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:03.520
near the hallway

02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:05.520
so

02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:07.520
AGM409 in our chatroom says keep

02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:09.520
a look on at SlickDeals.net

02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:11.520
suggest that

02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:13.520
too. So

02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:15.520
I think we might be losing the internet again

02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:17.520
we are so unfortunately

02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:19.520
that brings the ActDeaf call to a close

02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:21.520
ActDeaf I don't know if you can hear us

02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:23.520
but thank you so much for your call we really appreciate

02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:25.520
it

02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:27.520
Is that it? Did the internet go down completely

02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:29.520
again? Yes it did. We lost the show

02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:31.520
again. Again!

02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:33.520
Sorry! It's not your fault

02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:35.520
It's just Comcast. It's frustrating

02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:37.520
but I know it's not your fault. It's because of the rain.

02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:39.520
It does this every

02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:41.520
year you know. Right when the rainy

02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:43.520
season starts and it gets cold

02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:45.520
It gets cloudy and the cables like

02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:47.520
ahhhh clouds!

02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:49.520
It just seems to do this

02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:51.520
like when it starts getting hot and when it starts getting cold

02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:53.520
It's irritating

02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:55.520
but I'm not mad at you. It's redonk

02:56:55.520 --> 02:56:57.520
I'm not mad at you I'm mad at the situation

02:56:57.520 --> 02:56:59.520
Alright well any other

02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:01.520
last minute stories to get out before we wrap it

02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:03.520
up? Someone's developing

02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:05.520
a My Little Pony MMO

02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:07.520
that's disturbing

02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:09.520
I have a new story

02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:11.520
Yesterday was my mom's birthday. Happy birthday

02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:13.520
to my mom. That's not news

02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:15.520
Hey

02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:17.520
I love my mommy

02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:19.520
And then

02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:21.520
also apparently Gearbox

02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:23.520
being awesome. There was a

02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:25.520
guy that was a Borderlands fan

02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:27.520
who died of cancer

02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:29.520
at the age of 22 and so

02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:31.520
Gearbox actually

02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:33.520
did a eulogy

02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:35.520
as Claptrap and also

02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:37.520
this kid will

02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:39.520
be featured in the next

02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:41.520
Borderlands game as an NPC

02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:43.520
which is kind of cool

02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:45.520
Well that's

02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:47.520
a nice gesture. That's always

02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:49.520
really nice to see the companies do that for

02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:51.520
you know

02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:53.520
people when they die

02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:55.520
that were important. Especially if it was really before

02:57:55.520 --> 02:57:57.520
their time

02:57:57.520 --> 02:57:59.520
Well I guess is that it for

02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:01.520
last minute stories?

02:58:01.520 --> 02:58:03.520
Yeah that's pretty much it

02:58:03.520 --> 02:58:05.520
Unfortunate. Alright well

02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:07.520
unfortunately we're missing a Skype line right now

02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:09.520
I feel really bad especially for those guys

02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:11.520
that tune up live but again

02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:13.520
out of our control. Well that's the part of the show

02:58:13.520 --> 02:58:15.520
where we go around and get everybody's final

02:58:15.520 --> 02:58:17.520
thoughts and wrap things up

02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:19.520
so I will say

02:58:19.520 --> 02:58:21.520
this. I'll start with this of course once again guys

02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:23.520
thanks for tuning into our show and supporting

02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:25.520
Orange Launch Radio even when we're having crazy

02:58:25.520 --> 02:58:27.520
internet downtime and so forth. We really

02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:29.520
appreciate it. It means a lot to us

02:58:29.520 --> 02:58:31.520
If you like what you hear all we ask tell a friend about

02:58:31.520 --> 02:58:33.520
the show. Word of mouth is so important

02:58:33.520 --> 02:58:35.520
we just want to build our community and grow

02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:37.520
stronger and maybe

02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:39.520
find some people that work for the cable company who

02:58:39.520 --> 02:58:41.520
can make sure our internet connection stays up. Who knows

02:58:41.520 --> 02:58:43.520
Let's go

02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:45.520
around and get everybody some final thoughts for the night

02:58:45.520 --> 02:58:47.520
DarkSakura do you have any final thoughts

02:58:47.520 --> 02:58:49.520
tonight? We go to print this week

02:58:49.520 --> 02:58:51.520
I have

02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:53.520
a seven page research paper due

02:58:53.520 --> 02:58:55.520
this week

02:58:55.520 --> 02:58:57.520
Next week

02:58:57.520 --> 02:58:59.520
I

02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:01.520
will probably not cry so much

02:59:01.520 --> 02:59:03.520
I'm about ready to go

02:59:03.520 --> 02:59:05.520
Loki do you have a final thought tonight?

02:59:05.520 --> 02:59:07.520
I will be playing Saints Row the

02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:09.520
third this week at some point

02:59:09.520 --> 02:59:11.520
That's my goal at least

02:59:11.520 --> 02:59:13.520
Hopefully sooner rather than later

02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:15.520
If not I'll play Saints Row 2

02:59:15.520 --> 02:59:17.520
on PC

02:59:17.520 --> 02:59:19.520
My final thought tonight is

02:59:19.520 --> 02:59:21.520
A. I'm really bummed about

02:59:21.520 --> 02:59:23.520
the internet going down but I guess

02:59:23.520 --> 02:59:25.520
the one silver lining about it is that

02:59:25.520 --> 02:59:27.520
means we're going to finish up early just

02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:29.520
in time for peepers

02:59:29.520 --> 02:59:31.520
Alright

02:59:31.520 --> 02:59:33.520
that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio

02:59:33.520 --> 02:59:35.520
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our

02:59:35.520 --> 02:59:37.520
show we really appreciate it

02:59:37.520 --> 02:59:39.520
Did it just come back up?

02:59:39.520 --> 02:59:41.520
Well we'll come back up in time for folks to hear the credits

02:59:41.520 --> 02:59:43.520
Have a wonderful night everybody we'll see you next

02:59:43.520 --> 02:59:45.520
week hopefully with less

02:59:45.520 --> 02:59:47.520
internet lulls. Good night everyone

02:59:47.520 --> 02:59:49.520
You've been listening to

02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:51.520
Orange Lounge Radio

02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:53.520

See you next week
