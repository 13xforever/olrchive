00:00:01,863 --> 00:00:05,444

00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:07,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Up next, Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_01]: The following program is intended for mature audiences.

4
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:16,027
Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:16,147 --> 00:00:19,468
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loki.

6
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:20,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

7
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:37,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, November 27th, 2011, a special connect for Windows is detailed, one group of people want Skyrim to be banned, and is Sony planning an answer to Smash Bros.? ?

8
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:50,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:52,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:00:52,856 --> 00:01:01,486
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live at All Games Radio where we do tape live every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

11
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,990
[SPEAKER_07]: www.allgames.com if you want to tune in to listen.

12
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,532
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

13
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost full.

14
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:28,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

15
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:35,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I made lamb leg with parsnips in the slow cooker.

16
00:01:35,437 --> 00:01:38,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I took the broth, so it's got all that good meat fat in it.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Food, food, food, food, food, food.

18
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:42,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And cooked quinoa in it, so now my quinoa's creamy.

19
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:48,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I notice in your other hand, you have an old friend of the show who's been gone for like several years.

20
00:01:48,327 --> 00:01:49,287
[SPEAKER_04]: He ran away to die.

21
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:52,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes his triumphant return to the show tonight.

22
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to say hello?

23
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:54,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

24
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:57,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but this is going to break your heart, or my heart anyway.

25
00:01:57,474 --> 00:02:00,794
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here we go.

26
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:02,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's working now.

27
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:06,875
[SPEAKER_04]: He was going... Oh, and I pressed it earlier.

28
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:11,236
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the OLR ferret, the official orange laundry... Oh, God.

29
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,377
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not doing healthy after all these years.

30
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:17,037
[SPEAKER_07]: He might need to have an operation.

31
00:02:17,077 --> 00:02:19,398
[SPEAKER_07]: You might have to open up his butt and replace the battery.

32
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Well... Oh, but look at that face.

33
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:26,197
[SPEAKER_07]: The Orange Lounge Radio ferret is slowly dying, ladies and gentlemen.

34
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:29,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like the quality of this program.

35
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello as well.

36
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:32,281
[SPEAKER_04]: He's gonna model my quinoa.

37
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:36,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why you're bothering to take a picture of it because we have no website right now, but hey.

38
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:38,286
[SPEAKER_07]: The flicker still works.

39
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:38,687
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

40
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:39,568
[SPEAKER_07]: The flicker still works.

41
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:40,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it up there for when it comes back.

42
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Joining us as well, hopefully not about to soon die.

43
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:47,196
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll be with us for a long, long time.

44
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:48,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

45
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:51,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you can replace the batteries in those by cutting the stomach open.

46
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I did that one time.

47
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:55,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember we had like four ferrets at one time.

48
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:56,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

49
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:57,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where they went.

50
00:02:57,524 --> 00:03:00,425
[SPEAKER_07]: You came into the show one time and you were like, hey, Jamie, here.

51
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:02,046
[SPEAKER_07]: And you threw like five ferrets at her.

52
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:05,327
[SPEAKER_04]: And I held them all the entire episode because they were my babies.

53
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:10,309
[SPEAKER_07]: We mailed one to one of our friends in Colorado, Rai Chan.

54
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:13,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if she still listens, but she's out there.

55
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:17,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we gave another one to a longtime OLR listener.

56
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:19,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't one of them get stuck to a Katamari?

57
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:20,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

58
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:38,943
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

59
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:16,461
[SPEAKER_07]: but thankfully so around 4 o'clock that day we just had to make a decision like okay well we can't even really tape a show without internet because we use internet to get our stories and to do some of the other incidental background music and stuff so we couldn't do a show period so we said eh we'll just take the week off anyway it's right before Thanksgiving so whatever a lot of shows are going to be off

60
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:21,922
[SPEAKER_07]: We're back here tonight to news that we don't have a website right now.

61
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:27,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I know when you go to orange.com, it says something about an account billing issue.

62
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,303
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually not the issue.

63
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,344
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not something as obvious as Rob didn't pay the bill.

64
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:34,064
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the man bringing us down.

65
00:04:34,164 --> 00:04:34,465
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

66
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:35,705
[SPEAKER_07]: It's SOPA.

67
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:37,025
[SPEAKER_07]: It went into effect, everybody.

68
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:40,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, because we play music during the show.

69
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:40,546
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

70
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:42,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the 1%.

71
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:44,508
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the man.

72
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:46,769
[SPEAKER_07]: No, here's the thing.

73
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:52,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Our website space has been graciously donated for the past... When did we move off of my personal domain?

74
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:54,114
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about seven years ago.

75
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:55,815
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it was a long, long time ago.

76
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:56,835
[SPEAKER_07]: We were on live 365.

77
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it that way.

78
00:04:58,336 --> 00:04:59,117
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a long time ago.

79
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:00,178
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

80
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:42,365
[SPEAKER_07]: and unfortunately when things break because we don't pay for it that doesn't mean things get fixed right away so we have to understand that you know beggars can't be choosers so he is aware he's working on it don't pester him about it he knows and I know he's working really hard to try and fix it one way or another even if that ends up meaning we have to kind of get web space somewhere else so keep an eye on our Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR or our Facebook and we'll let you know what's going on with the website as we know

81
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:48,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, this does mean that it affects the podcast folks because without a website, we can't deliver the podcast.

82
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,113
[SPEAKER_07]: So the only people here in this show right now are our live listeners.

83
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:59,019
[SPEAKER_07]: And it probably won't make the feed tonight, which is unfortunate because we've been on a really good track record of getting the show up for the Monday morning crowd.

84
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And sadly, it won't be there for them tonight.

85
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,982
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll get it up as soon as we possibly can.

86
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:07,166
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully you podcastees will be listening to this before too long.

87
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:08,166
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

88
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,037
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

89
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:40,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, if that's too difficult, just go to chat.allgames.com and they'll point you in the right direction.

90
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:46,458
[SPEAKER_07]: And my apologies to the fine folks at All Games Chat, but they'll understand, I hope.

91
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:52,541
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyhow, before we get into our gaming weeks and all that, I thought we could talk a little bit about this.

92
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:54,501
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something I kind of wanted to talk about last week.

93
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,682
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't end up having a show.

94
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:56,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

95
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,003
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not your fault.

96
00:06:58,443 --> 00:06:59,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Just things happen.

97
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:02,165
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk a little bit about charity.

98
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:02,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Waffle Irons

99
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Waffle irons for $2?

100
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Waffle irons for $2 you say?

101
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, just try not to get clobbered with one.

102
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:28,792
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the YouTube of all them people fighting over $2 waffle irons?

103
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:29,813
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quite a sight to behold.

104
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:30,473
[SPEAKER_08]: That's stupid.

105
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:31,975
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to hear something else that's stupid?

106
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:41,942
[SPEAKER_08]: We got back after having Thanksgiving dinner with our family and we came home and we're like, crap, there's like nothing to do.

107
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:43,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's watch TV.

108
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:47,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey look, Lady Gaga's having a Thanksgiving...

109
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:48,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Special.

110
00:07:48,647 --> 00:07:50,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see it, believe it or not.

111
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:52,328
[SPEAKER_08]: She made waffles with salami.

112
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't say she made waffles.

113
00:07:55,109 --> 00:08:01,751
[SPEAKER_08]: A chef that makes food for her was making waffles with salami in them.

114
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:04,471
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird, but I'd try it.

115
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:09,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you tempted by Gaga's delicious waffles?

116
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:10,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you were.

117
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:13,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Waffles are good, but it was weird.

118
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:13,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Waffle Gaga.

119
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Lady Woff Woff.

120
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,585
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds kind of dirty.

121
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:20,385
[SPEAKER_07]: It does a little bit.

122
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:20,685
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

123
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,206
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyhow, charity.

124
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:22,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

125
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:24,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Going back to charity.

126
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:33,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Child's Play is obviously one of the biggest gamer charities, and they've kicked off their official donation season during the holidays.

127
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:35,853
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a lot of stuff going on, like Desert Bus.

128
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:39,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Gosh, this has been, what, the fifth year I think that's been going on?

129
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,817
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't know what Desert Bus is, I don't think you've been following a lot of the gaming internet stuff, but we'll explain it anyway.

130
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:49,439
[SPEAKER_07]: There's this game that came out on... God, what system was Desert Bus on?

131
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:50,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that a 3DO game?

132
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,502
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on some obscure-ish system, wasn't it?

133
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:56,002
[SPEAKER_04]: That was on the Sega CD.

134
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:58,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That was part of the Penn & Teller game.

135
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,664
[SPEAKER_04]: That was on the Sega CD.

136
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:00,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Sega CD?

137
00:09:00,364 --> 00:09:03,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Penn & Teller's Smoke & Mirrors.

138
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:05,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew it was one of those CD systems I didn't have.

139
00:09:05,647 --> 00:09:07,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And you drive a bus for like...

140
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:08,889
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing.

141
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:18,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And the deal is, you drive a bus from LA to Vegas, but don't expect the graphics to look like, you know, Burnout or something.

142
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:22,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't the whole thing is that they hate video games or something, so they made a video game?

143
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:22,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

144
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:23,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

145
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:24,749
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

146
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:27,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about the realism or something.

147
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and you really drive the actual distance.

148
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:33,221
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not abbreviated.

149
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:37,003
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're not allowed to drive above a certain mileage because you're driving a bus.

150
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So to drive from one to the other takes like four hours.

151
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:49,067
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can't just rubber band the button down or anything because every so often you have to slightly adjust your steering or the bus will go off track.

152
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because the alignment's not correct.

153
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:51,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

154
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:55,050
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you make it all the way, you score one point.

155
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:57,822
[SPEAKER_07]: It Takes Like 4 Hours to Do So

156
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,181
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

157
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:43,571
[SPEAKER_07]: DesertBus.com

158
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:15,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is nice because they actually donate all the proceeds for the iOS 1 to the Child's Play charity And I want to say, wasn't that the one where Penn Jillette actually ended up donating money?

159
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:23,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it was this year, I think it was last year or something He donated quite a bit of money, like he actually knew about it So, it's kind of neat

160
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,274
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyhow, lots of charity stuff going on.

161
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:33,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, think about some of that money you saved on all those, you know, Black Friday sales or Steam sales or so forth.

162
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about giving it to a good cause.

163
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:41,044
[SPEAKER_07]: And even if that cause is not child's play for you, maybe it's, I don't know, St.

164
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:47,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Jude's Hospital, March for Babies, American Red Cross, whatever the charity is.

165
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:52,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Although about the American Red Cross, though, keep your money out of, you know, those guys...

166
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:56,890
[SPEAKER_08]: ringing the bells in front of retail stores.

167
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,650
[SPEAKER_05]: The Salvation Army?

168
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

169
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:58,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a fan?

170
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was Red Cross, but Salvation Army.

171
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:06,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, don't give them any money because, especially now, I guess they're taking credit cards as well.

172
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:17,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, do I really want to slide a credit card through a skimmer that they may have so that I can hopefully get the money going to them and not some crook?

173
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:19,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Just do it through online if you're going to do that.

174
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:22,780
[SPEAKER_07]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio, not necessarily.

175
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,500
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyway.

176
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:27,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, they have caught a number of scammers.

177
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:29,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be careful.

178
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:31,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Always be careful.

179
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:32,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a receipt.

180
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it through the websites.

181
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:43,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just do Desert Bus or Umlaut, because those are two ones we know, or Child's Play themselves, and those are several different ones we know are reputable and all that.

182
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:56,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow Let's move on, let's talk about video games And how was your gaming week The video games you've been playing this week I don't know about you guys, but I've played a ton So let's go around the table, start with DarkSakura Ladies first

183
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I actually played some stuff while my internet was sort of working.

184
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:04,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually played a lot of droplets, Rob.

185
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,295
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that random-ass puzzle game that's on Steam, huh?

186
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:08,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's actually pretty funny.

187
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:09,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny.

188
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun, I should say.

189
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:16,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to say it's like Pipe Dream, but it does involve pipes and water going through, but it's all like they're falling.

190
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:17,520
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've run out of drops.

191
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

192
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:41,450
[SPEAKER_04]: and you have to collect them in your reservoir and get more and you can actually get little pockets that will open up that you can get more drops and so you get a score as long as you have drops to play with actually I have to look at my Steam list because I have to look at what I was like I actually played a bunch of Portal 2 as well just you know again while my internet was not working

193
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:42,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Do the Humble Indie Bundle

194
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:19,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they have a bundle going on right now there's a different type of bundle we're going to talk about a little later in the show but as far as the gaming bundle there's nothing right now but there probably will be one soon enough those have been doing very well so we'll see

195
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:27,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I was also playing some Doom 2 and playing Peggle Extreme.

196
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:33,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to play Magicka, but while my internet was down, it was like, no, you can't play this game.

197
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:37,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a few people actually all gave me the same game.

198
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:40,387
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave me Fallout New Vegas.

199
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:42,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee, tough problem.

200
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, several people bought you Fallout New Vegas?

201
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it was on sale earlier this week.

202
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess so.

203
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:49,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it on your wish list or something?

204
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:50,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it might have been.

205
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:51,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, there you go.

206
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:56,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can look, but yeah, Fallout New Vegas is actually really sweet.

207
00:14:56,195 --> 00:15:05,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I put up a couple of screenies from... I can pull up my Steam account and show people a few screenies, but I mean...

208
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:26,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I had never really had much of an interest in playing it, but when I started playing it, it really... I had friends that played the RPG and kind of seeing their books and seeing how the game set up, it actually kind of seemed like the same, you know, had the same feel, except then you're, you know, first person.

209
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can play third person.

210
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,341
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play behind the shoulder.

211
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't actually get as bad motion sick as I might have.

212
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:32,298
[SPEAKER_04]: RedHair

213
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:45,941
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

214
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:06,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't know what game they did, they're the folks behind Darwinia.

215
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:13,459
[SPEAKER_07]: So Darwinia is in this bundle, as well as Uplink, Defcon, Multiwinia is all in this.

216
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you pay more than the average, which right now is $3.75, gosh, that's so low.

217
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:21,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope you'd pay at least like $10 or $20 for this.

218
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:26,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Aquaria and Crayon Physics Deluxe get thrown in as well.

219
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:27,766
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a bundle going on right now.

220
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:28,446
[SPEAKER_07]: My apologies.

221
00:16:28,996 --> 00:16:29,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

222
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:32,239
[SPEAKER_07]: How much longer is that going for?

223
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that like just tonight or is that going into next week?

224
00:16:35,742 --> 00:16:36,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

225
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight days left.

226
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:38,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.

227
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,025
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got some time there.

228
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:40,607
[SPEAKER_07]: You got at least another week.

229
00:16:40,647 --> 00:16:42,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually if you wait to the end, there's more stuff tacked on.

230
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like they've already done it.

231
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:45,631
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

232
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:49,795
[SPEAKER_07]: And even if you buy early, you still get the extra stuff that they end up adding.

233
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:53,639
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I really like about the way Humble Bundle does it is that you get steam codes for everything.

234
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:18,909
[SPEAKER_04]: so like I bought it and then I just loaded it all into Steam the last time I bought one which was the bundle that had VVVV in it so yeah pretty cool oh yeah I've actually played more than oh yeah I did play WoW for the record I'm working on my rep with the Shatari Skyguard good times so I can fly around on a fat short manta ray there's a birthday party going on in WoW right now

235
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:21,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that thing.

236
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:25,191
[SPEAKER_04]: It messes up my look, Rob.

237
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:28,354
[SPEAKER_04]: And just a little quick side note.

238
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:28,694
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

239
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:33,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever that freaking Tarin was that was killing all my birds, DIAF.

240
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,080
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

241
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:36,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

242
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:43,186
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is going to be continuing on because we're not playing Grand Theft Auto anymore.

243
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:45,447
[SPEAKER_08]: We're playing Call of Duty now.

244
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,408
[SPEAKER_08]: This is weird to me.

245
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:48,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

246
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:49,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still kicking ass, though.

247
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,370
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

248
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,771
[SPEAKER_07]: You've turned into a bro.

249
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:54,871
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

250
00:17:55,772 --> 00:18:00,014
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been, what, like less than a week and I'm already trying to mod the game.

251
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:03,495
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm working on a mod for Call of Duty.

252
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan's yelling from the other room, make it not suck.

253
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:15,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a tangent about bros I want to talk about in a minute.

254
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:15,804
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been pretty fun.

255
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:24,730
[SPEAKER_08]: We're playing hardcore mode because they don't like the fact that I can kill faster if I have a map and I can see where people are firing from.

256
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:27,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still killing pretty fast anyways.

257
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:28,713
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just

258
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:29,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

259
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,527
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I am working on something actually kind of unique for it.

260
00:18:55,028 --> 00:19:11,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like some special balance mod thing where each class would have different weapons and a special ability kind of like a button or something that you would have a one minute ability that would be like god mode or invisibility or something like that.

261
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:14,536
[SPEAKER_08]: And then with a five minute cooldown for each thing.

262
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:19,418
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really intricate, but you can actually program quite a bit and call it to you, which is kind of cool.

263
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:21,299
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to mess around with that.

264
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, hopefully I'm going to mess around with Grand Theft Auto mods at some point.

265
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've just been really distracted by everything.

266
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:29,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played Saints Row.

267
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:30,745
[SPEAKER_08]: I've pretty much beat Saints Row.

268
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:32,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I have beat Saints Row almost 100%.

269
00:19:34,428 --> 00:19:39,331
[SPEAKER_08]: All the side missions and stuff were done except for the car thefts.

270
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:42,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And those are really annoying because it's really glitched.

271
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:48,057
[SPEAKER_08]: The one I was on now, apparently every time you go into the zone to steal the car...

272
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:49,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

273
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,210
[SPEAKER_08]: For the most part, I have everything done.

274
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:23,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have to play through the game again to finish some missions in a different way, like Act 1, finish that in a different way, and then also the third act I have to finish, or Murder Brawl, I have to do that a different way.

275
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:30,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Did the Tron parody stuff in Saints Row end up being good, or was it just kind of... Yeah, that's pretty much what you saw in the video.

276
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:31,497
[SPEAKER_08]: They had some interesting stuff.

277
00:20:32,137 --> 00:20:34,578
[SPEAKER_08]: There's even a little bit of Zork in there.

278
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:35,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

279
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get eaten by a Gru?

280
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:39,494
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there's actually a text adventure part.

281
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:40,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

282
00:20:40,315 --> 00:20:44,359
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to do a little bit of stuff there.

283
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:46,101
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's pretty awesome.

284
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:50,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you end up in front of a house and there is a white mailbox here?

285
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:51,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that.

286
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:57,236
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a parody of it, so you have to go kill a unicorn, is what it is.

287
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:59,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn you, unicorns!

288
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:14,281
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was something with that, but what's kind of cool, though, is the perks that you get from beating that portion of the game is you actually get one of the combat tanks, and you get to drive around the city and fire it, and it has all the sound effects from combat, which is great.

289
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:15,821
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big, blocky tank.

290
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,162
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they also have...

291
00:21:17,662 --> 00:21:18,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

292
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:40,757
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

293
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:09,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm afraid.

294
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:11,885
[SPEAKER_07]: She'll be wearing all black and kill things with fire.

295
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:13,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

296
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:14,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I kill things with fire.

297
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:16,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I approve of the killing with fire.

298
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:22,530
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, because what's great about it is you can actually go into the... Well, you can go on the website.

299
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,772
[SPEAKER_07]: She should have a giant menorah she whaps people with.

300
00:22:25,672 --> 00:22:27,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I would not do that to my menorah.

301
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:29,314
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have that.

302
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:34,477
[SPEAKER_08]: What's kind of cool, though, is you can go on the website and...

303
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:35,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

304
00:22:53,486 --> 00:22:56,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got so much I'm trying to play right now anyway.

305
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:57,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I can use another one.

306
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:58,930
[SPEAKER_07]: But you really should play Saints Row the Third.

307
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:03,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do want to play Saints Row the Third, especially knowing that somebody else made my damn character.

308
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:04,153
[SPEAKER_07]: It is awesome.

309
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:05,734
[SPEAKER_07]: But it actually turned out really good.

310
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:06,055
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

311
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:08,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw the pictures and I'm like, that's cute.

312
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:09,977
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such a great game.

313
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:15,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, I enjoyed every minute of it.

314
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:17,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play it for over 30 hours because I got that achievement.

315
00:23:17,702 --> 00:23:18,163
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 and 30.

316
00:23:18,203 --> 00:23:18,783
[SPEAKER_08]: 3 and 30, I guess.

317
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,168
[SPEAKER_08]: and play over 30 hours of the game.

318
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,513
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, aside from that, I've been playing Skyrim, which is great.

319
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:43,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost gave it up pretty quick because the first time I played the game, something glitched out and I went to the first town I'm supposed to go to and everyone started attacking me, trying to kill me.

320
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:43,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like...

321
00:23:45,203 --> 00:23:46,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what the fuck?

322
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't do anything because you guys keep trying to attack me.

323
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:51,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for the one character I was supposed to talk to.

324
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:54,169
[SPEAKER_08]: He was fine, but everyone's trying to kill me.

325
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:57,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, okay, I don't understand why you have to piss everybody off.

326
00:23:58,032 --> 00:24:04,476
[SPEAKER_08]: So I finally tried it again, and I'm really enjoying it because now it's actually working correctly.

327
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:07,138
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have accidentally murdered somebody.

328
00:24:07,898 --> 00:24:08,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

329
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I hit somebody with a sword.

330
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I decapitated somebody and forgot.

331
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:14,843
Oops.

332
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:25,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like I had something earlier that I ran into, like I decided to go exploring off and then I see this giant attacking these two people, so I'm going to go help them.

333
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,271
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, you know, start shooting fire at the giant.

334
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:33,274
[SPEAKER_08]: So people started coming and attacking me because I guess some of the splash damage started hitting them.

335
00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:36,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you fucking idiots, you know, so what?

336
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:37,296
[SPEAKER_08]: You got injured a little bit.

337
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I killed the giant for you.

338
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:47,720
[SPEAKER_07]: For such an enormously enormous game, like a game as vast as Skyrim, it does really have its derpy moments.

339
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:54,002
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some real things in Skyrim that just don't make sense.

340
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:59,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it should be like, if you do a little bit of damage to somebody, they're like, hey, you know, don't do that, or something.

341
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:14,074
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if you continually do that, then they should start attacking you, but not just like, oh, I accidentally dealt a little bit of damage to you, or like, oh, you ran in front of my arrow, or something like that, and unfortunately you got stuck with an arrow.

342
00:25:14,735 --> 00:25:22,379
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have a little bit of like, you know, kind of, hey, stop that, and then start attacking you if you keep attacking them.

343
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:31,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that'd be a little bit better than, you know, oh, I accidentally hit you with a fireball because I was aiming at the troll that's right next to you or something like that.

344
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:37,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, um... I like some of the lulzy stuff people have done with Skyrim Online, like the house full of cabbage.

345
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:37,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

346
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:59,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to fight, once again, exploring because I'm trying to get enough money to buy these booths to allow me to pick up more things, which is ironic because I got the money, the amount of money that was in the game to do that, and all of a sudden I go back down to buy them, oh, and now they're more expensive.

347
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:01,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, fuck you, I'm not buying those anymore.

348
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,691
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

349
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:43,433
[SPEAKER_08]: so I was like ah shit these things look magical that's not good so I killed them and then it was the Wisp mother that was there started shooting like some ice thing at me and so I decided to go try to kill her and that took about 15 to 20 minutes to actually take her down because I'm such a low level character yeah but they level with you so it would have taken 15-20 minutes anyway

350
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

351
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:55,111
[SPEAKER_07]: You do get a little bit of edge because of the talents and so forth that you get, but unfortunately the enemies, it's not like a Final Fantasy where if you just grind, grind, grind, you'll be able to overpower everything.

352
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:55,831
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't work like that.

353
00:26:55,851 --> 00:27:00,154
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, so yeah.

354
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:08,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, in any Elder Scrolls game, you should just do the main story first, so that way you can just do it when it's easy and then go back and do open world lousy fun.

355
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we should do that then.

356
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:12,582
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way to approach an Elder Scrolls game, I really think.

357
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:30,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so yeah, so I, it took me about 15 minutes, but it's funny because, you know, you were saying the house full of cabbages and stuff, and the game's not exactly realistic, like, at one point, because I had a bunch of stuff from crafting things, either, you know, making food or making, uh, you know, alchemy and stuff like that.

358
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:36,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to the point where I had exhausted my potions that I had with me, and I'm like, crap, I need more health.

359
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:40,137
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, I ate, like, 13 pounds of food at one point.

360
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:41,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Like,

361
00:27:42,738 --> 00:27:43,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Level up.

362
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:46,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Your skill in pooping has increased to 21.

363
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:48,182
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just ridiculous.

364
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:51,544
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, here's this two-pound cheese wheel.

365
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,426
[SPEAKER_08]: This will give you two health.

366
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:58,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to eat four of those.

367
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:06,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I can imagine this guy, like, high minor rock just shoving his mouth full of, like, cabbage and carrots and, like,

368
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:31,105
[SPEAKER_08]: you know raw rabbit and just all sorts of ridiculous stuff that you happen to be carrying with you and I also found another way it was kind of fun um I was really sad because remember how they had the thing where oh you can steal from people by putting pots over people's heads I thought there was only a pc until I figured out you have to hold a and then you can move shit around and I was like oh thank god it doesn't work though I haven't gotten it to work at all

369
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:32,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe there's a trick to it.

370
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:33,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never tried it.

371
00:28:33,206 --> 00:28:33,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is too bad.

372
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:49,251
[SPEAKER_08]: But it allowed me to, you know, because one of the things I kind of do is I pick up everything that, you know, is not attached, which is great because, like, you do, like, missions for people and stuff and all of a sudden they become, you know, friendly with you and they'll just let you take everything.

373
00:28:49,311 --> 00:29:00,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I did a mission for the guy at the trading post or whatever and after that, it's like everything in the house allowed me to take it almost except for, like, expensive armor and stuff.

374
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:05,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, you know in our chatroom at chat.understandsradio.com disagrees with me on what I'm saying about the level scaling.

375
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:08,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Saying the enemies don't really level with you anymore in Skyrim, Rob.

376
00:29:08,577 --> 00:29:11,717
[SPEAKER_07]: They changed it due to people not liking it in Oblivion.

377
00:29:11,757 --> 00:29:12,998
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more like Fallout now.

378
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:13,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

379
00:29:13,938 --> 00:29:18,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I could have sworn somebody was telling me that they were playing the game twice and saw the difference.

380
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,060
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe it's not as much of a weight as it was before.

381
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

382
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:28,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I like being able to overpower everything, personally.

383
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:30,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that's true.

384
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:32,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played enough Skyrim.

385
00:29:32,664 --> 00:29:35,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I really haven't because I've been distracted by so many other games.

386
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:38,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably will not give Skyrim proper attention until Christmas time.

387
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:42,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Skyrim's hilarious because at one point I was like, oh, hey, wait a second.

388
00:29:43,288 --> 00:29:44,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I can swim in the river.

389
00:29:45,123 --> 00:29:50,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm diving underwater and I'm catching salmon for no apparent reason other than I can.

390
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:53,810
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the whole thing about Skyrim.

391
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why I'm doing this.

392
00:29:55,892 --> 00:29:56,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I can.

393
00:29:57,093 --> 00:29:58,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Skyrim with the physics.

394
00:29:58,374 --> 00:30:02,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you can go along this mountain trail or you can just walk straight up the mountain.

395
00:30:02,897 --> 00:30:05,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hit jump a lot and you'll eventually climb the mountain.

396
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:07,131
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I do.

397
00:30:07,611 --> 00:30:11,752
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I found out that if you're carrying too much, obviously it slows you down.

398
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:18,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So what you can do is you can grab one more object by holding A, and it'll just hover out in front of you, and then you just run back to town.

399
00:30:18,394 --> 00:30:26,656
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, of course, if you get to any doorway, you'll pick it up, take it in your inventory, walk through the door, drop it, and pick it up again using the hold A thing, and just keep on running.

400
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:27,896
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

401
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:29,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I was able to take one... I brought you a pen!

402
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:32,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I was able to take one more battle axe.

403
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:33,857
[SPEAKER_08]: How stupid must that look?

404
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:39,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby has joined chat to try and clarify.

405
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:42,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Our good friend Bobby Blackwolf who tapes before us live at All Games Radio.

406
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:43,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Try and clarify.

407
00:30:44,296 --> 00:30:46,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring a little clarity to the rim of Sky.

408
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:49,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky says, here's how it works.

409
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Blackwolf says, Sky, here's how it works.

410
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:55,003
[SPEAKER_07]: When you first enter a dungeon area, it generates the enemies to your level.

411
00:30:55,383 --> 00:31:00,607
[SPEAKER_07]: If you leave that dungeon, go level up and go back in, they will be the same level they used to be.

412
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:03,469
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can overpower them, but not on the first entry.

413
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:04,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that makes a lot of sense.

414
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what you need to do.

415
00:31:06,471 --> 00:31:08,512
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to find all the dungeons at level one.

416
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:13,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm saying, go do the story mode right away.

417
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:17,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to, but I get distracted so much.

418
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:17,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

419
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear you.

420
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:26,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, I have taken everything in that town, the first town, the Riverwood, whatever, and I've taken everything that has not been bolted down.

421
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:27,325
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.

422
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:28,966
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so many glitches in the game.

423
00:31:29,026 --> 00:31:31,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you fill a house with cabbage?

424
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:34,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a house to fill with cabbage yet, but I have a lot of cabbage.

425
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:35,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, damn it, now you have a mission.

426
00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:38,605
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've eaten a lot of cabbage too, so that's not good.

427
00:31:39,746 --> 00:31:41,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else about your gaming week?

428
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:43,829
[SPEAKER_08]: We could talk about Skyrim all night.

429
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

430
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:54,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, for example, one of the tricks you can level up any skill by those people that will actually tell you, like the first town you go to, there's an elf there that will help you improve your archery.

431
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you invite him into, you can invite him to, you know,

432
00:31:58,602 --> 00:32:00,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Join you and he'll come and help you.

433
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:07,226
[SPEAKER_08]: So you go and you pay for that and then you go, I need to trade with you and you take your money back and then you pay him again and take your money back.

434
00:32:07,286 --> 00:32:16,391
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, the other thing is you can take his house key for no apparent reason or just take all of his inventory and then you go to his house and steal everything.

435
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:19,493
[SPEAKER_07]: And then go to the middle of the forest and say, okay, wait here.

436
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:22,548
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

437
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:43,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

438
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:03,185
[SPEAKER_04]: How about bitch?

439
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:04,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she's a really tough bitch.

440
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:09,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on top of that, you kill her and she doesn't really die.

441
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:12,428
[SPEAKER_08]: She just comes back to life again and starts fucking trying to kill you again.

442
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:13,909
[SPEAKER_07]: She might be integral to the story or something.

443
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:17,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You probably can't kill people that keep you from completing the actual story.

444
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

445
00:33:19,451 --> 00:33:20,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

446
00:33:20,352 --> 00:33:20,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you don't care.

447
00:33:21,195 --> 00:33:23,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Just finish the story then go do whatever you want.

448
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:24,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever you want.

449
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:26,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Burn a whole village down for all I care.

450
00:33:26,777 --> 00:33:27,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Then wait for the DLC.

451
00:33:28,437 --> 00:33:28,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

452
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:30,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else for your gaming week?

453
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:33,319
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of Zuma.

454
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,439
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

455
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me move on.

456
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I got some games I want to talk about.

457
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I've played a lot.

458
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I can only talk about some of the games I've played this week because I've played a lot in the past couple weeks since we last had a show.

459
00:33:44,062 --> 00:33:49,186
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me start with the one I've probably played the least of, which is Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

460
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:52,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought this more for Alan because he wanted it.

461
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:54,470
[SPEAKER_07]: And keep in mind, we didn't own Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

462
00:33:55,191 --> 00:33:58,833
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like we knew that they were going to release a new version just nine months later.

463
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:01,175
[SPEAKER_07]: So we ordered that over Amazon.

464
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,436
[SPEAKER_08]: They always do.

465
00:34:02,696 --> 00:34:03,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

466
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:04,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that for next time now.

467
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:08,321
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to be wary about buying Capcom games when they first come out.

468
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:12,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to be convinced they're not going to release an Uber edition six months later.

469
00:34:13,124 --> 00:34:16,647
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really my first taste of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at all.

470
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:25,133
[SPEAKER_07]: The controls are weird because I guess they took more of a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom direction with them.

471
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:26,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a fan.

472
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:28,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Much easier if you've got the arcade controller.

473
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:29,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I could see that.

474
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:30,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see that.

475
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:34,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not a fan because I like my games like Street Fighter, but that's okay.

476
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:37,490
[SPEAKER_07]: The art style is really good.

477
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,111
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so fun to play on like an HDTV with awesome sound.

478
00:34:41,992 --> 00:34:43,392
[SPEAKER_07]: The graphics and everything look great.

479
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:45,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of great characters.

480
00:34:46,173 --> 00:34:49,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Some weird choices, especially on the Capcom side, but okay.

481
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:50,936
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Rocket Raccoon.

482
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,637
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I said on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.

483
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:54,297
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Marvel.

484
00:34:54,937 --> 00:34:55,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Rocket Raccoon is Marvel.

485
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:56,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

486
00:34:56,818 --> 00:34:59,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I say weird choices on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.

487
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:00,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but that's a weird one.

488
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is weird.

489
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:02,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear you.

490
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:03,601
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was saying.

491
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:04,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you liked Rocket Raccoon.

492
00:35:04,982 --> 00:35:06,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like Rocket Raccoon.

493
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:07,403
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just sort of out of the blue.

494
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:07,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

495
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:09,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are some weird choices in there.

496
00:35:10,244 --> 00:35:13,305
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it can't all be, you know, totally mainstream.

497
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:14,626
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of part of the fun of it.

498
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:18,167
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I've just done some light skirmishes in that.

499
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:19,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Very difficult game, too.

500
00:35:19,728 --> 00:35:21,689
[SPEAKER_07]: The difficulty's even on very easy.

501
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:22,649
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be a pain in the ass.

502
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan was screaming at the TV trying to beat Galactus, or at least, you know, kind of.

503
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:29,545
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't really scream at the TV but just in his irritated way.

504
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:30,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Flick.

505
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:30,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know, right?

506
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,750
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that was Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

507
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,792
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought a game on Steam that was dirt cheap last week.

508
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:41,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Not during this whole autumn sale they've been doing, but last week.

509
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:47,938
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a game called Magicka on sale for like $2.50, and you could even download the demo.

510
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:53,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Or no, you downloaded the full game, and you could just play the full game for free through Sunday.

511
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:55,482
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the kind of stuff Steam can let you do.

512
00:35:56,303 --> 00:35:58,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So I ended up buying the Uber edition for like $9.

513
00:35:58,304 --> 00:35:59,825
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes with all the expansions.

514
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:00,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked Magicka.

515
00:36:00,665 --> 00:36:01,066
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cool.

516
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:01,486
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like...

517
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:02,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

518
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:20,554
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

519
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,525
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's interesting kind of learning about the combinations.

520
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:44,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So exploration definitely plays heavy into this.

521
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:51,307
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the game as well, and I know we talked about this on the show a while back, but it had some very strange expansions.

522
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:55,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the first expansion for Magicka is Magicka Vietnam.

523
00:36:57,109 --> 00:37:17,010
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's the little magic characters in Vietnam and the joke is because all the shooter games end up having a Vietnam expansion so Magicka got a Vietnam expansion there's a lot of very tongue-in-cheekness the game is very tongue-in-cheek it's sharp-witted I think it was right after they announced the Battlefield Bad Company 2 Vietnam expansion

524
00:37:19,085 --> 00:37:23,308
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, so I was... And then they did some other expansions after that.

525
00:37:23,388 --> 00:37:27,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I enjoyed Magicka, and it was fun to play.

526
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,851
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play it online, too.

527
00:37:29,091 --> 00:37:33,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Alan and I were doing co-op in the same room over Steam online.

528
00:37:33,254 --> 00:37:33,834
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty fun.

529
00:37:34,174 --> 00:37:36,776
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can play, like, I think up to four or six people at once.

530
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:40,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's all these other modes I haven't even touched yet because, again, other games have distracted me.

531
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:41,259
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's, like...

532
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:44,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Challenge Modes, and PvP, I guess is a big element.

533
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:49,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I got the Uber Edition, I got all these different Magicka types.

534
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:52,987
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's funny is that one of them is like a Tron dude.

535
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:56,070
[SPEAKER_07]: They all wear the little hooded robe things.

536
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,050
[SPEAKER_07]: They look like little monks.

537
00:37:57,371 --> 00:38:01,554
[SPEAKER_07]: But this particular monk has the energy lines and carries an energy disc, right?

538
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:03,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played that when I was playing online with Alan.

539
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:04,856
[SPEAKER_07]: He couldn't heal me.

540
00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:06,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And we couldn't figure it out.

541
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:07,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the hell can't you heal me?

542
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I can heal you, but you can't heal me.

543
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:14,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's because since I was playing as Tron dude, you don't heal me with life, you heal me with lightning.

544
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,786
[SPEAKER_07]: So whenever he would shoot a lightning bolt at me, I would heal.

545
00:38:17,906 --> 00:38:24,231
[SPEAKER_07]: So just funny little quirks like that were in the game and kind of lead to the puzzle elements of Magicka.

546
00:38:24,831 --> 00:38:25,772
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um...

547
00:38:27,134 --> 00:38:28,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of everything out right now, you're playing that?

548
00:38:41,232 --> 00:38:45,837
[SPEAKER_07]: So we went to Evil G one day because we had a gift card we had to spend.

549
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:51,363
[SPEAKER_07]: So we found a game that was the perfect amount of money and it was White Knight Chronicles 2.

550
00:38:51,603 --> 00:38:52,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there.

551
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:53,044
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on sale.

552
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:53,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you were there.

553
00:38:53,725 --> 00:38:54,306
[SPEAKER_07]: You did come with us.

554
00:38:55,487 --> 00:39:02,214
[SPEAKER_07]: White Knight Chronicles 2 we bought on sale for $40 and it comes complete with the first game, which I did play a little bit before.

555
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:09,804
[SPEAKER_07]: When it was actually done by Sony, but now this game has been out in Japan and Europe for a while, but D3 finally put it out here.

556
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:14,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I guess the first game didn't do so hot, but it has a real cult following to it.

557
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:16,113
[SPEAKER_07]: So now the second game's out.

558
00:39:16,914 --> 00:39:18,096
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot like...

559
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:45,415
[SPEAKER_07]: the .hack games on PS2 you can play the first game all over well actually you couldn't even do this in the .hack games because they didn't come with each game but imagine if like the first .hack what .hack infection and the next one like imagine if they were bundled together you can either start the first game which is what they called the remastered version although I call it the they made the annoying text box slightly less annoying and a couple other little things you probably won't notice

560
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:48,356
[SPEAKER_07]: or you could just start the second game at level 35.

561
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:51,163
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

562
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:19,820
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura,

563
00:40:39,222 --> 00:40:46,786
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a bad game, but it's just a... It does a lot of things, but none of them are best in class.

564
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:50,527
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a game that gets straight Bs across the board.

565
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:56,770
[SPEAKER_07]: The story's not really in A. The graphics are pretty good.

566
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,672
[SPEAKER_07]: The music's good, but it's not great.

567
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:02,133
[SPEAKER_07]: The character design, it's neat, but there's a lot of repetition.

568
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:08,656
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like it gets straight Bs, but he put it all together, and it makes for a really deep experience.

569
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:09,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Xanadu.

570
00:41:10,257 --> 00:41:10,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

571
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but yeah, I can't stop playing.

572
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like grind, grind, grind, grind.

573
00:41:15,162 --> 00:41:19,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I could be playing Skyrim, yet I'm playing this game because it's like I have to beat story mode.

574
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:20,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to get to level.

575
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:22,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to get to the White Knight Chronicles 2.

576
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:24,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to be able to play with people online.

577
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:24,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't stop playing.

578
00:41:25,952 --> 00:41:48,270
[SPEAKER_07]: a couple other negatives I'll say about the game really disappointed that there was an online store mode where you buy things for your village like houses and scenery but this stuff will impact the amount of stuff that you can grow which in turn is what's for sale at your stores so that's my long way of saying you can buy your way to a competitive edge in this game

579
00:41:48,930 --> 00:42:10,558
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's not just that but they actually sell items at the Sony store that are like this coupon is good for 20% increased experience for one week so there's a lot of like really cheap stuff like that and I almost want to flunk the game on those grounds alone however I do have to realize there is this online component that they're not charging money for

580
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:16,742
[SPEAKER_07]: that does have about the depth of Phantasy Star Universe, and Phantasy Star Universe does still charge money to this day.

581
00:42:17,122 --> 00:42:18,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Why they just don't go free-to-play, I don't know.

582
00:42:19,243 --> 00:42:29,230
[SPEAKER_07]: So I give it a slight pass on those grounds, because I feel like, okay, well, fair enough, they are providing a robust online component, they gotta make the money for that somewhere, I guess.

583
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,612
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do frown on the fact that they sell things to give you a competitive edge.

584
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:37,615
[SPEAKER_07]: That shit is just... As a gamer, it bothers me.

585
00:42:38,616 --> 00:42:40,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like it in other games, too, so...

586
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:48,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, Actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, wait, White Knot Chronicles 2 has both games?

587
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:51,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to tell a friend that wants it to get that instead of the first one.

588
00:42:51,984 --> 00:42:52,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, absolutely.

589
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:54,885
[SPEAKER_07]: The first game is pointless at this point.

590
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:58,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if you can get it $10 used, awesome.

591
00:42:58,986 --> 00:43:02,087
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can import what you do in the first game into the second game.

592
00:43:02,448 --> 00:43:03,148
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do that.

593
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:06,629
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to just start at level 35 because the level cap in the first game was 50.

594
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:09,410
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you grind your way to 50 and then do it that way.

595
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:09,930
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh,

596
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's really no point, and this game's probably not that expensive.

597
00:43:14,393 --> 00:43:19,656
[SPEAKER_07]: White Knight Chronicles 2 was $40 on sale, but that was a pre-Black Friday type sale.

598
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:21,637
[SPEAKER_07]: When did we go to Evil G, DarkSakura?

599
00:43:22,137 --> 00:43:23,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that like Wednesday?

600
00:43:23,638 --> 00:43:25,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, yeah.

601
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:25,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

602
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,461
[SPEAKER_07]: You can probably find it used even cheaper like somewhere else.

603
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:30,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

604
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:35,183
[SPEAKER_07]: But be careful because it has an online pass called GeoNet.

605
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:42,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't do any of the online features without the – you get the one free with the new copy and then it's going to be $10 otherwise.

606
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:43,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Sunday.

607
00:43:43,685 --> 00:43:44,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunday morning.

608
00:43:44,425 --> 00:43:46,786
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right because the show didn't happen.

609
00:43:46,866 --> 00:43:47,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

610
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:47,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

611
00:43:48,006 --> 00:43:50,787
[SPEAKER_04]: But we went in the morning because I was running away from the football game.

612
00:43:51,027 --> 00:44:17,153
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah yeah so anyway White Knight Chronicles 2 straight B's yet I can't stop playing it go figure and then here's a game that I've also been playing a lot of and it's Super Mario 3DS and I gotta say I'm just gonna be blunt this is my favorite Mario game in the past 20 years I think for real like I think this is my favorite Mario game since like Super Mario World I think

613
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:19,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's great.

614
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:24,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if you own a 3DS, I don't know why you would not get this game.

615
00:44:24,617 --> 00:44:29,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I seriously do not know why you would be a Nintendo supporter and not want Mario 3D Land.

616
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,220
[SPEAKER_07]: It is outstanding.

617
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,621
[SPEAKER_07]: The level design is fantastic.

618
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:40,425
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of throwbacks to a lot of things you see in the Mario series, as well as some new stuff, like the whole Boomerang Mario.

619
00:44:41,225 --> 00:45:06,144
[SPEAKER_07]: um but yeah I mean I can't stop thinking about the level design the level design is so good they're linear levels like what you would see in a Mario game yet they have that slight openness of like Mario 64 yet they're not too damn open like I think some of the levels in that game and even like Galaxy and Sunshine were like there definitely is that Mario linear path to it um

620
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:07,485
[SPEAKER_07]: How's the 3D?

621
00:45:29,244 --> 00:45:30,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Believe it or not, it's neat.

622
00:45:31,225 --> 00:45:41,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I was not the biggest fan of Mario 64, and I've taken shit for that on this show over the years, and a lot of that was because I didn't like the transition from 2D to 3D.

623
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:47,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario 64 was one of the first big 3D games, and I realize a lot of people disagree with me on that, and that's fine.

624
00:45:47,716 --> 00:45:48,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Every gamer gets their own opinion.

625
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:51,519
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was a little worried about this at first, but...

626
00:45:52,319 --> 00:46:02,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I think because the levels still feel somewhat linear-esque to me, but still have a sense of openness to them, I'm not bothered by the 3D at all.

627
00:46:02,148 --> 00:46:06,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And the actual 3D effects are cool.

628
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:09,694
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're with purpose in some places.

629
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:16,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's some kind of puzzle rooms, for lack of a better term, that you actually kind of use 3D in.

630
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:18,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you play it in 2D?

631
00:46:18,882 --> 00:46:19,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

632
00:46:19,742 --> 00:46:20,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Would it look as good?

633
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:21,063
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

634
00:46:21,463 --> 00:46:22,344
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't look as good.

635
00:46:22,564 --> 00:46:24,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So you think they've really got the hang of the 3D now?

636
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:45,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, and I'll tell you one thing I love, love, and I think all the 3DS games need to do this, is they have a switch now that not only can you adjust the intensity of the 3D, but with the switch of the D-pad, if you press the up arrow, then the 3D is up, like it's outward 3D, whereas if you hit the down arrow, it's inward 3D.

637
00:46:46,477 --> 00:46:46,937
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

638
00:46:46,957 --> 00:46:49,278
[SPEAKER_07]: That may not make a lot of sense the way I'm saying it.

639
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:49,758
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

640
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:52,258
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you play it, you'll see what I mean.

641
00:46:52,558 --> 00:46:55,759
[SPEAKER_04]: It's instead of one will project, the other will immerse.

642
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:56,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

643
00:46:57,139 --> 00:47:00,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And this can help some of the effects, like depending on your eyes.

644
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:13,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Like sometimes I notice if I'm playing the projector 3D, there's these stages where these spiked ball things will kind of swing back and forth, like out.

645
00:47:13,783 --> 00:47:18,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, sometimes the 3DS does this thing where when they swing forth, your vision starts to split.

646
00:47:18,427 --> 00:47:19,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Get the ghosting.

647
00:47:19,308 --> 00:47:23,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you see the ghosting and all that, but if you do the inward 3D, I don't see that at all.

648
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:31,718
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably how I would have to play the whole thing, given that every other thing I've played on a 3DS, I get the problem all the time.

649
00:47:31,918 --> 00:47:35,201
[SPEAKER_07]: You can kind of choose what 3D works for you.

650
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:36,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

651
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:43,815
[SPEAKER_07]: So, let's see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and looking at some comments here.

652
00:47:44,275 --> 00:47:47,218
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Dollar Bill says, please tell me it's not like Mario 64.

653
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:49,000
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like Mario 64.

654
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,084
[SPEAKER_07]: In my opinion, it's better.

655
00:47:52,284 --> 00:47:54,706
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's going to be a lot of people that disagree with me on that, and that's fine.

656
00:47:56,488 --> 00:48:00,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, SJ100Matt says, Rob, you're not the only person I've heard say this.

657
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:06,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, Actdeft says, I liked Super Mario 64, but I get why people don't like it.

658
00:48:07,272 --> 00:48:09,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Heck, my favorite Mario game is still Super Mario World.

659
00:48:10,234 --> 00:48:10,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine too.

660
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:13,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario 3D Land is not without flaw.

661
00:48:14,616 --> 00:48:17,839
[SPEAKER_07]: For instance, the street pass stuff is weird.

662
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:28,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you have these mystery boxes that are very similar to the Toad Houses where if you can clear a mystery box in like 10 or 15 seconds, you might get a chance at a bonus coin.

663
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:36,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess the deal with is that if you street pass with people, all it does is it's like they give you a new mystery box.

664
00:48:36,552 --> 00:48:40,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not necessarily one that they've played or I don't think it really is anything but...

665
00:48:40,715 --> 00:48:43,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you got a little bonus because you street passed with someone.

666
00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:47,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of a little like, boy, that seems somewhat forced.

667
00:48:47,898 --> 00:48:55,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So to that, I say derp derp, but it doesn't really detract from the single player game experience, which is still great.

668
00:48:56,722 --> 00:49:02,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, street passing will allow you to get more bonus coins, I think, which will allow you to get some of the levels and stuff.

669
00:49:03,205 --> 00:49:06,407
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're really good at single player, you could still do it.

670
00:49:06,972 --> 00:49:10,795
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, one week from today, Mario Kart 7.

671
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:11,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

672
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:17,720
[SPEAKER_07]: See, there's been a lot of skepticism about the 3DS, and rightfully so.

673
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this game blows any of the launch titles out of the fucking water, including Street Fighter 4.

674
00:49:23,464 --> 00:49:24,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they launched with this?

675
00:49:25,706 --> 00:49:26,967
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have launched with this.

676
00:49:27,827 --> 00:49:30,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, maybe there's a method to the madness.

677
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:35,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they didn't want to have the sellouts, which would seem weird for Nintendo, but maybe they wanted to launch it early.

678
00:49:36,193 --> 00:49:53,154
[SPEAKER_07]: and have this slow build, I don't know or maybe they legitimately thought it would launch heavier than it did, but if this game can't sell the 3DS nothing will it's as simple as that if the 3DS, if this game does not carry 3DS sales

679
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:56,850
[SPEAKER_07]: There really is nothing else they can put out on it.

680
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:58,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I truly believe that.

681
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,191
[SPEAKER_07]: This Mario game is about as good as a Nintendo game gets.

682
00:50:01,771 --> 00:50:03,792
[SPEAKER_07]: It's better than Galaxy.

683
00:50:04,152 --> 00:50:05,472
[SPEAKER_07]: It's better than New Super Mario Bros.

684
00:50:05,492 --> 00:50:05,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii.

685
00:50:05,772 --> 00:50:06,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think so.

686
00:50:06,693 --> 00:50:07,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it better than Sunshine?

687
00:50:07,893 --> 00:50:09,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Sunshine was pretty epic.

688
00:50:09,953 --> 00:50:11,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's better than Sunshine.

689
00:50:13,462 --> 00:50:14,923
[SPEAKER_07]: No shine, get!

690
00:50:14,983 --> 00:50:16,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people think Sunshine was ass.

691
00:50:17,145 --> 00:50:18,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was a lot better.

692
00:50:19,146 --> 00:50:25,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't get how you can like Mario 64 and hate Sunshine, but I guess it has to do with the whole water element, but whatever.

693
00:50:26,052 --> 00:50:28,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually like 64 a whole lot.

694
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:33,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I like 64, but I don't think it's... I like this game better.

695
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:33,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do.

696
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:51,498
[SPEAKER_07]: this is going to be one of the best games of the year period this is a great year for games like I'm seriously sitting back going how can I choose between Mario 3D Land Portal 2 and Skyrim which one of these games is the best game of the year because they are all fucking good like really fucking good

697
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:54,401
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's some games I haven't even touched yet.

698
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:59,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hearing amazing things about Zelda Skyward Sword, which I'm sure a lot of us are.

699
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:04,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think any of us in the room, oddly enough, have touched that yet, but I'm hoping to get my hands on it before the end of the year.

700
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:06,350
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot I still haven't played.

701
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,911
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a great year for games.

702
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:08,991
[SPEAKER_08]: It really has.

703
00:51:09,452 --> 00:51:18,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Thankfully, as far as releases go, aside from Mario Kart 7, there's no real big major releases in games until the end of January.

704
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:42,867
[SPEAKER_07]: so you got a few weeks to catch up on some stuff at least so Salacious Pop in our chatroom says Sunshine was pretty terrible to be honest but I also hated 64 I didn't see his thoughts on this one but I can tell you since we're playing on the same cartridge he's been playing quite a bit he's about as far in the game as I am so I'm thinking he's liking this one

705
00:51:43,527 --> 00:52:07,805
[SPEAKER_07]: so I'm hearing there's a lot of stuff I don't want to like spoil things more than I probably already have but I hear there's a lot of stuff you can kind of unlock if you do really well in a lot of levels and I think that's great it kind of gives the game some value and obviously there's the coins that you can go back and get and so forth but I get the sense that unlike you know 64 where you had to play the same level over and over to get the stars and all that like if you miss

706
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:28,969
[SPEAKER_07]: if you don't get a single coin in the damn game I think you can still beat it I think you can still fight Bowser and beat the game but you will miss like 10 bonus levels you'll miss the chance to unlock the extra gate you know there's just I think there's a lot to build for so anyhow

707
00:52:30,305 --> 00:52:44,305
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah good gaming week and I still have to play more Skyrim I really do and then after the Civilization sale on Steam the other day I was like we need to have another Civ night so anyway it's a great time to be a gamer it really is

708
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:47,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have one more little thing.

709
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, what do you want to throw out there before we get into some gaming news?

710
00:52:51,091 --> 00:52:56,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when you were talking about Umlaut, I forgot to mention that I designed the badges and tickets this year.

711
00:52:57,492 --> 00:53:01,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So everyone needs to go and hold on to my work forever.

712
00:53:02,374 --> 00:53:10,976
[SPEAKER_07]: So your graphic design chatter on this show is not for naught because now your stuff is actually going to be a part of this gaming event.

713
00:53:10,996 --> 00:53:11,456
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really cool.

714
00:53:11,761 --> 00:53:13,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and no, you don't get a preview, everyone.

715
00:53:14,202 --> 00:53:15,723
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can't show anybody.

716
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you have to go to the event and find out.

717
00:53:17,524 --> 00:53:18,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's seen it, though.

718
00:53:18,424 --> 00:53:20,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I can't say anything about it.

719
00:53:20,646 --> 00:53:21,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to the show and find out.

720
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:23,007
[SPEAKER_07]: You can tell them it looks good.

721
00:53:23,127 --> 00:53:24,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it looks very professional.

722
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:25,008
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.

723
00:53:25,128 --> 00:53:25,988
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks very professional.

724
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:38,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I don't know how much I can and can't say on air, but I will just say, understanding the source material, you did a really good job making everything consistent.

725
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:41,677
[SPEAKER_07]: and kind of putting your own spin on it.

726
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:43,058
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's awesome.

727
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:44,800
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the goal, branding.

728
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

729
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:45,881
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the big thing.

730
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:52,686
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was actually really fun to do and probably one of the fastest I've ever gotten anything accomplished.

731
00:53:54,448 --> 00:54:02,934
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so for people who actually can't make it, they'll be up on my portfolio after the event's over.

732
00:54:02,954 --> 00:54:03,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

733
00:54:04,216 --> 00:54:08,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm supposed to be doing something as well, but I don't think I'm at liberty to say yet.

734
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen... Once the official word is out there, I'll be able to say something.

735
00:54:12,725 --> 00:54:13,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all I can say.

736
00:54:13,866 --> 00:54:16,129
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really hope you're going this year.

737
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:17,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone be there.

738
00:54:17,991 --> 00:54:20,033
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you really should go to Umlaut.

739
00:54:20,113 --> 00:54:20,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Fly out.

740
00:54:22,055 --> 00:54:22,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Join us.

741
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:23,196
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

742
00:54:24,677 --> 00:54:25,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick housekeeping.

743
00:54:25,658 --> 00:54:27,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

744
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

745
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:32,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And hey, we're now on Google+.

746
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:37,666
[SPEAKER_07]: That happened, the show we weren't at last week, but we are now on Google+, as well.

747
00:54:38,426 --> 00:54:43,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, Google did not smarten up and let you have a custom URL, but it's really easy to find us on there.

748
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:51,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in your little Google Plus search box, look for Orange Lounge Radio, and it'll probably pop up by the time you get Orange and L in there, so...

749
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:55,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep an eye out for that and Plus One Us and all that stuff on Google+.

750
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:57,632
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get into some gaming news.

751
00:54:57,652 --> 00:55:00,293
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like, what, an hour into the show with all the games that we played this week?

752
00:55:00,373 --> 00:55:01,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's actually get into some gaming news.

753
00:55:02,214 --> 00:55:09,137
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a good thing we spent an hour talking about gaming weeks because our show is a little bit abbreviated this week because of the website problems.

754
00:55:09,177 --> 00:55:10,978
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have quite as much news as usual.

755
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:16,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is also a slow news week because, you know, it's been a big holiday here in the States.

756
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:18,802
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a few big stories we're going to get to here.

757
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say also, though, look forward to this in Part B tonight.

758
00:55:23,144 --> 00:55:25,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Listless returns in Part B tonight.

759
00:55:26,126 --> 00:55:28,628
[SPEAKER_07]: We love to fill slow news weeks with OLR games.

760
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,370
[SPEAKER_07]: So Listless coming up tonight in Part B. Okay, sorry Loki, your turn.

761
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:43,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so Sony is reporting that the PlayStation Move has shipped 9 million units and a million of those have been over the past half year.

762
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:47,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, there's a lot of funky math when you go to look at this.

763
00:55:48,342 --> 00:55:51,324
[SPEAKER_08]: One, it's unit ship, not necessarily sold.

764
00:55:51,605 --> 00:55:59,990
[SPEAKER_08]: And two, unlike... You can't compare this to the Kinect, where Kinect is a solid unit, and that's all you need to use the Kinect.

765
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:05,734
[SPEAKER_08]: The Move has multiple components, so you can have up to four Move controllers per system.

766
00:56:06,194 --> 00:56:11,718
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not even sure if they're counting the navigation controllers or whatever else to go along with that.

767
00:56:11,858 --> 00:56:12,018
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

768
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:15,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows what that necessarily means.

769
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:17,742
[SPEAKER_08]: 9 million move units shipped.

770
00:56:19,363 --> 00:56:19,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

771
00:56:20,084 --> 00:56:22,065
[SPEAKER_08]: But, hey, it's not bad.

772
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:26,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, 9 million is a good number, even if it is, you know, 4 per system.

773
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:30,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

774
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:31,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know.

775
00:56:31,932 --> 00:56:34,354
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just doing better than I thought it was.

776
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:36,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.

777
00:56:38,577 --> 00:56:39,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Ours is hooked up now.

778
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:40,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it yet.

779
00:56:41,368 --> 00:56:44,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have the Move controllers, but I actually have no Move.

780
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:51,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, aside from LittleBigPlanet 2 obviously supports it, but I don't have any Move required games yet.

781
00:56:52,904 --> 00:56:55,188
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't really play my PlayStation 3 that much either.

782
00:56:55,248 --> 00:56:57,190
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I loan out all my PlayStation 3 games.

783
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:58,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Outro Outro Outro

784
00:57:14,861 --> 00:57:17,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what I'm going to be playing a lot of in the next few days?

785
00:57:18,344 --> 00:57:19,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega Saturn!

786
00:57:20,746 --> 00:57:21,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

787
00:57:21,506 --> 00:57:22,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Christmas nights.

788
00:57:23,328 --> 00:57:23,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

789
00:57:23,888 --> 00:57:25,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot that's like your yearly little thing.

790
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Your fun thing.

791
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:28,672
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

792
00:57:29,853 --> 00:57:36,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as far as the move goes, though, do you think the move is a wash at this point?

793
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:39,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you think they're still going to try and breathe some life into it?

794
00:57:40,821 --> 00:57:53,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think that it, there's still plenty of life to be brought into it because after all, um, they could, I mean, they're, they support it in most of their first party games.

795
00:57:54,370 --> 00:58:09,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, like Resistance and Killzone and, uh, SOCOM all support the move and plus, you know, they have a lot of, um, games coming out that are going to be supporting, that are pretty big like, you know, Bioshock Infinite is going to be supporting the move.

796
00:58:11,061 --> 00:58:17,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that they do have a good grasp on how to use the move with hardcore games per se.

797
00:58:18,104 --> 00:58:20,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Better than the Kinect, that's for sure.

798
00:58:20,426 --> 00:58:29,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give Sony props for that because the way that they've done Kinect support for the hardcore games, if you will, like Halo and Forza 4...

799
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:50,636
[SPEAKER_08]: it sucks it's terrible I mean head tracking sounds like a good idea not implemented very well at all and voice commands and halo no it's stupid it's absolutely terrible do you think it's because the Kinect didn't end up being hardware wise what it should have been like it should have been a better camera in there

800
00:58:51,485 --> 00:58:52,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know if that's the case.

801
00:58:53,608 --> 00:58:57,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, if that is the problem, couldn't they revise the heart?

802
00:58:58,615 --> 00:59:00,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait for the next Xbox at this point.

803
00:59:00,718 --> 00:59:02,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

804
00:59:03,522 --> 00:59:05,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it could have been better, but

805
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Sopa Stop Online Piracy Act

806
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,271
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not aware, basically there is an act that's being explored.

807
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:45,100
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't passed yet, but it's one of those things that's going through the committees, which means it likely could go for a vote even before possibly Congress takes a break for the holidays coming up in December.

808
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,564
[SPEAKER_07]: And in short, the Stop Online Piracy Act will allow the government to force...

809
00:59:51,204 --> 01:00:20,559
[SPEAKER_07]: internet service providers to basically blacklist websites make it unable to access websites domain names based on the fact if they are offering infringing material or not you know what they're trying to stop is they basically want to shut down things like the Pirate Bay like that'll be one of the first things that gets thrown up there is that they'll block that domain so that you can no longer pirate if you've been using that site you know videos and movies and so forth and so on

810
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but this is causing a lot of controversy.

811
01:00:24,841 --> 01:00:28,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, the fact is, it's kind of like how they are censoring things.

812
01:00:29,683 --> 01:00:35,867
[SPEAKER_07]: And well, a, a lot of people are saying straight up when you talk censorship of the internet, it's like, dude, this isn't China.

813
01:00:36,247 --> 01:00:37,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are we censoring the internet?

814
01:00:37,627 --> 01:00:38,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Blocking websites?

815
01:00:38,988 --> 01:00:40,529
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's, that's a China thing.

816
01:00:40,589 --> 01:00:41,389
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they do there.

817
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:42,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are we doing this?

818
01:00:43,831 --> 01:01:01,944
[SPEAKER_07]: and, you know, obviously what they're trying to do is stop piracy but unfortunately, you know, this act, I feel, kind of leaves it very vague because my understanding is that if a company were to complain that this website is offering infringing material, that website could just get shut down.

819
01:01:02,979 --> 01:01:03,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on a minute.

820
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,001
[SPEAKER_07]: We have something here in this country called due process.

821
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:08,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, I believe they do.

822
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:11,686
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not as simple as they complain about.

823
01:01:11,806 --> 01:01:17,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it does actually have to go in front of a judge to say, okay, here's our evidence that this site's doing that.

824
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:21,633
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not just sites that have pirated material.

825
01:01:21,793 --> 01:01:26,316
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sites that they claim facilitate finding that.

826
01:01:26,777 --> 01:01:29,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So like Google, for example.

827
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:36,043
[SPEAKER_07]: And Pfizer's behind this because it's also targeting websites that sell, like, fake Viagra.

828
01:01:36,163 --> 01:01:38,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Pfizer's the drug company that created Viagra.

829
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:44,770
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, how much spam mail do we get every day about go to this Canadian pharmacy website that sells Viagra or whatever it is?

830
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:47,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but we're still going to get that spam.

831
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's not going to go away.

832
01:01:48,893 --> 01:01:51,835
[SPEAKER_08]: God, if it was going to get rid of the spam, that would be awesome, but no.

833
01:01:52,215 --> 01:01:54,557
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple ways – and why –

834
01:01:55,205 --> 01:02:14,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even really get to the story, I was giving the background on this A lot of gaming companies have come out actually in support of this Like Nintendo's in support of it, I believe Microsoft finally came out First they weren't, now they are Sony's in support of it, a lot of the game companies Hollywood loves it, Hollywood wants this Hollywood's the one trying to push this through Hollywood's trying to push it through

835
01:02:15,706 --> 01:02:16,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Sopa needs to, quote,

836
01:02:37,992 --> 01:02:45,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance key innovation, privacy, and security considerations with the need to thwart the threat rogue websites pose.

837
01:02:46,298 --> 01:02:48,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, quote, And I totally agree with this guy.

838
01:03:09,073 --> 01:03:09,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

839
01:03:26,038 --> 01:03:27,218
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what we do here.

840
01:03:27,698 --> 01:03:28,238
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

841
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:28,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

842
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:33,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm really torn because whereas I'm like, okay, if they want to stop piracy, they have a right to stop piracy.

843
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they can't really stop piracy.

844
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:41,261
[SPEAKER_08]: What they're doing is they're just blocking access to these sites because these sites operate in countries that don't have the same piracy laws as we do.

845
01:03:41,641 --> 01:03:47,402
[SPEAKER_08]: So really, as far as jurisdiction goes in the U.S., there's nothing they can do about it other than block them.

846
01:03:47,462 --> 01:03:47,822
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

847
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:55,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's great about this, you know, act, because you can obviously tell that the person that drafted this is really...

848
01:03:57,204 --> 01:03:59,345
[SPEAKER_08]: It only blocks domain names.

849
01:03:59,485 --> 01:04:00,686
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what domain names are, right?

850
01:04:00,706 --> 01:04:04,788
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just basically easy ways for you to remember an IP address.

851
01:04:05,129 --> 01:04:06,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your cell phone book.

852
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:12,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, in this day and age, how many people actually have all the numbers in their cell phone book memorized?

853
01:04:12,893 --> 01:04:13,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Very few.

854
01:04:13,953 --> 01:04:15,054
[SPEAKER_07]: You might know your parents.

855
01:04:15,114 --> 01:04:17,094
[SPEAKER_07]: You might know your significant other, but that's about it.

856
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:20,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know my significant other's phone number.

857
01:04:20,836 --> 01:04:21,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't.

858
01:04:21,376 --> 01:04:22,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's the thing, though.

859
01:04:22,356 --> 01:04:22,776
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

860
01:04:22,796 --> 01:04:25,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know your significant other's phone number either.

861
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:25,977
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in my phone.

862
01:04:26,537 --> 01:04:26,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

863
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:29,078
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a bunch of things that they're assuming to be true.

864
01:04:29,138 --> 01:04:37,861
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, these websites or whatever, obviously if they feel that they're going to be threatened or taken down or whatever, they're just going to give you the IP address.

865
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:40,302
[SPEAKER_08]: You type in the IP address, boom, you're at the website.

866
01:04:40,382 --> 01:04:41,022
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not blocked.

867
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:46,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I think at the end of the day, you have to hold these websites responsible and that's the only way to stop the problem.

868
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:48,090
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not that easy because they're not all in America.

869
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:48,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the problem though.

870
01:05:02,846 --> 01:05:21,025
[SPEAKER_08]: much like piracy and stuff they're going to try all these things to try to stop piracy but all it's going to do is hurt other people and not necessarily get rid of the piracy problem the problem is just like everything else with piracy just like we've seen time and time again

871
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:25,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time they've tried to do something, such as let's say Ubisoft DRM, right?

872
01:05:25,847 --> 01:05:27,928
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not connected to the internet, the game shuts down.

873
01:05:28,428 --> 01:05:29,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Pirates had it cracked in two days.

874
01:05:30,289 --> 01:05:31,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Who did that shit ultimately hurt?

875
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,051
[SPEAKER_07]: The legitimate users.

876
01:05:33,371 --> 01:05:37,393
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's going to be the problem with SOPA, is that the pirates will find their way around it in two days.

877
01:05:37,873 --> 01:05:39,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's gonna ultimately get hurt?

878
01:05:39,415 --> 01:05:52,789
[SPEAKER_07]: The legitimate users who are trying to access a website like allgames.com who suddenly got yanked because, I don't know, fucking Namco or somebody didn't like that they were playing the music from a 25-year-old video game or something, you know?

879
01:05:53,971 --> 01:05:56,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, legitimate people are gonna end up getting hurt.

880
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,796
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the problem.

881
01:05:59,096 --> 01:06:12,850
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's anything like, you know, I've read kind of these horror stories about some file sharing sites where, you know, Warner Brothers, they were sending cease and desist basically for files that weren't even their properties.

882
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:16,053
[SPEAKER_08]: It just happened to have, like, names of their stuff.

883
01:06:16,854 --> 01:06:19,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of the title was share their name.

884
01:06:19,196 --> 01:06:20,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I called my hard drive Batman.

885
01:06:21,391 --> 01:06:23,232
[SPEAKER_07]: So Warner Brothers wants to shut me down.

886
01:06:23,372 --> 01:06:24,693
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, something like that.

887
01:06:24,793 --> 01:06:26,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, like, you know, even, like, YouTube.

888
01:06:27,175 --> 01:06:33,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, YouTube videos now, I mean, obviously, that they can pull it if, you know, there's a complaint or something like that.

889
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,242
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just going to be really hard for them to do it.

890
01:06:37,302 --> 01:06:41,724
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just have a feeling that even if this law passes, I don't think it's going to do anything.

891
01:06:42,185 --> 01:06:43,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Did those, like, what was it?

892
01:06:43,245 --> 01:06:46,848
[SPEAKER_08]: The digital, I don't even remember what the hell it was.

893
01:06:47,168 --> 01:06:49,654
[SPEAKER_08]: The Millennium... I know what you're talking about.

894
01:06:49,674 --> 01:06:51,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, basically the DVD copying thing.

895
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:53,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Did that stop people from copying DVDs?

896
01:06:54,365 --> 01:06:54,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

897
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:55,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

898
01:06:56,089 --> 01:06:56,290
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

899
01:06:57,825 --> 01:07:01,006
[SPEAKER_08]: People find a way around it, and it's just, it's unfortunate.

900
01:07:01,566 --> 01:07:05,067
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't like the direction these folks are heading in, it's time to vote them out.

901
01:07:05,507 --> 01:07:22,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, I gotta admit, I'm sitting here going, I understand where this might be an issue or whatever, but I can think of a lot of things that are a bigger issue right now, and that is like, you know, I don't know, the fact that the whole country's going down the shitter, and people are very upset about that, you know, the whole thing.

902
01:07:22,852 --> 01:07:22,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

903
01:07:23,812 --> 01:07:26,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I get the... Watch out, Rob, you might get pepper sprayed.

904
01:07:26,734 --> 01:07:28,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And then locked into a detainment camp.

905
01:07:28,376 --> 01:07:30,417
[SPEAKER_07]: We do live just down the street from UC Davis, you know.

906
01:07:31,198 --> 01:07:33,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Not literally down the street, but we're not that far away, all things considered.

907
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:37,723
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we used to joke on the... Isn't it a long-running joke on this show?

908
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:41,966
[SPEAKER_07]: The People's Republic of Davis abandoned all hope, you enter here, and look at what fucking happened!

909
01:07:42,227 --> 01:07:43,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And you all can see it.

910
01:07:43,648 --> 01:07:46,770
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway... Anyway, outside of that joke...

911
01:07:49,028 --> 01:07:57,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, obviously, I do get the element though that Hollywood is pissed because piracy is hurting their industry, because it is.

912
01:08:00,049 --> 01:08:05,854
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think to an extent, there's two things hurting that industry.

913
01:08:06,495 --> 01:08:13,541
[SPEAKER_07]: You could say the piracy is one, but the other thing that's hurting them is their failure to adapt is killing traditional broadcast networks.

914
01:08:14,082 --> 01:08:20,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, their way of adapting is, well, we're just going to reduce the amount of options that you have.

915
01:08:20,848 --> 01:08:25,432
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, the stuff that they're doing on the retail side of things is hurting them.

916
01:08:25,492 --> 01:08:26,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, for example...

917
01:08:26,933 --> 01:08:53,986
[SPEAKER_08]: um you know there's the 28 day windows which will soon enough be 60 day windows as soon as those contracts are up next year um 60 day windows for you know movies being in Redbox and also on Netflix and also uh Warner Brothers um started all rental customers are not able to get stuff from you know a distribution stuff until 60 days after the fact including which is great uh

918
01:08:54,546 --> 01:08:59,610
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the first titles to do this, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2.

919
01:09:01,151 --> 01:09:05,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Just two weeks after that window is up, they're pulling Harry Potter out of circulation.

920
01:09:06,195 --> 01:09:06,775
[SPEAKER_08]: All of them.

921
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:07,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Gone.

922
01:09:08,156 --> 01:09:09,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of circulation.

923
01:09:11,079 --> 01:09:12,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you have to buy it now.

924
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,184
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to because it's going out of circulation so they can re-release it later on in a special Uber edition or something.

925
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:32,059
[SPEAKER_08]: but the fact that there's not rental options I mean not that there really is rental options because any rental store can go to the store and go buy it but it's limited because you know and when you can't find it you're like shit I'll just download it

926
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:54,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it's pretty easy to download stuff, and unfortunately, you know, those customers would have rented it, hey, maybe might have liked it, and went and bought it, and still there may be people that download a really crappy copy, and they're like, hey, you know what, that movie's pretty good, I'm gonna go buy it, but it just kind of leaves a sour taste in people's mouths, especially with all the fucking tons of re-releases, or remakes, or

927
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:57,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everyone needs to be voted out.

928
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:58,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Start from scratch.

929
01:10:16,741 --> 01:10:38,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Frisbee says Hollywood is irrelevant to entertainment anymore very interesting quote very interesting and very true I think in many ways because the whole well look at what we're doing here we're doing a radio program we're doing a podcast that people can listen to in their car without having to ever turn on the radio what about web shows like the guild

930
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:42,331
[SPEAKER_07]: or viral videos.

931
01:10:43,032 --> 01:10:53,979
[SPEAKER_07]: People at this point would rather watch cute kitty laughing and giggling videos or the dog that sounds like he's really saying I love you than watching Whitney.

932
01:10:54,059 --> 01:10:57,681
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot more entertainment options out there than there were say 30 years ago or whatever.

933
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:10,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, before when it was just like, okay, you've got radio, you've got movies, and you have TV.

934
01:11:10,887 --> 01:11:11,507
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

935
01:11:12,228 --> 01:11:14,568
[SPEAKER_08]: You can read a newspaper or a funny book or something like that.

936
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:15,828
[SPEAKER_08]: But now it's just the internet.

937
01:11:16,329 --> 01:11:19,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And, I mean, the internet's just got tons of content.

938
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:21,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything you're looking for, it's just right there.

939
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:27,611
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why these TV shows, if it's a media, you know, a very mediocre TV show, no one gives a fuck.

940
01:11:27,811 --> 01:11:28,891
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's gonna watch that.

941
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:30,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Whitney.

942
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:30,952
[SPEAKER_08]: It was terrible.

943
01:11:32,652 --> 01:11:35,093
[SPEAKER_08]: It just happens to come on sometimes after the office is done.

944
01:11:35,133 --> 01:11:36,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, ah!

945
01:11:36,374 --> 01:11:37,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Horrible show!

946
01:11:37,735 --> 01:11:38,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Off with you!

947
01:11:39,515 --> 01:11:42,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to sort of, I guess, kind of rein things back.

948
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:45,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone pay attention who you vote for.

949
01:11:46,278 --> 01:11:49,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't vote a party ticket because that's also just as dangerous.

950
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:53,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's how assholes get snuck into government positions.

951
01:11:54,682 --> 01:11:57,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop and take an effort to read who supports what.

952
01:11:58,323 --> 01:12:01,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a take-home ballot or an absentee ballot.

953
01:12:01,804 --> 01:12:02,764
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I vote every year.

954
01:12:02,824 --> 01:12:03,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Do your homework.

955
01:12:04,365 --> 01:12:04,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

956
01:12:05,425 --> 01:12:09,826
[SPEAKER_04]: And then double-check every box that you mark right before you mark it.

957
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:12,367
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the advantage of taking one of those home.

958
01:12:12,867 --> 01:12:13,948
[SPEAKER_04]: You have time to research.

959
01:12:13,988 --> 01:12:15,368
[SPEAKER_04]: You list out the pros and cons.

960
01:12:15,828 --> 01:12:18,989
[SPEAKER_04]: But the biggest thing is actually put some damn effort into your future.

961
01:12:20,862 --> 01:12:24,383
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people just don't vote because, oh, I don't care.

962
01:12:25,284 --> 01:12:31,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, oh, it's too much work for me to go and mark some check boxes or read up on this stuff.

963
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:33,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's too much work.

964
01:12:34,307 --> 01:12:40,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I'm going to buy this product because it's cheap and I don't care if they outsource all of their customer service.

965
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:41,569
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's cheap.

966
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:45,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about what you do before you fucking do it.

967
01:12:46,831 --> 01:12:48,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And put effort into your life.

968
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Dan just laugh from the other room?

969
01:12:53,324 --> 01:12:55,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because he's mad at me because I don't have a job yet.

970
01:12:58,915 --> 01:13:00,919
[SPEAKER_07]: You're expressing yourself in other ways.

971
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:03,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to express myself at a job.

972
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone hire me too while you're at it.

973
01:13:07,264 --> 01:13:14,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you might not be getting paid for it, but you at least have the fuzzy wuzzy, I contributed to a good cause.

974
01:13:14,508 --> 01:13:15,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Addendum.

975
01:13:15,689 --> 01:13:18,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a job that will pay me too.

976
01:13:20,591 --> 01:13:22,292
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't mind the charity work at all either.

977
01:13:22,332 --> 01:13:24,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind the charity work, but you don't know how many...

978
01:13:30,342 --> 01:13:31,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Rob's my dealer.

979
01:14:06,644 --> 01:14:18,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not going to live a life that I find morally objectionable.

980
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you could get like 10 votes from OLR listeners.

981
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on.

982
01:14:26,991 --> 01:14:28,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, in all seriousness.

983
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:30,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I do my story now?

984
01:14:30,391 --> 01:14:31,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you may do your story now.

985
01:14:31,752 --> 01:14:32,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

986
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:33,392
[SPEAKER_07]: We need fuzzy wuzzy happy news.

987
01:14:33,852 --> 01:14:36,193
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Indie Game Music Bundle?

988
01:14:36,673 --> 01:14:40,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, 10 albums for a dollar.

989
01:14:41,134 --> 01:14:52,977
[SPEAKER_04]: There's now the Indie Game Music Bundle, which is like the Humble Indie Bundle, but you get 10 items for a dollar, including stuff from Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV Minecraft.

990
01:14:54,057 --> 01:15:17,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's, uh, Minecraft Volume Alpha, uh, Cobalt EP, Super Meat Boy Digital Special Edition Soundtrack, Impostor Nostalgia, Ravenmark's Scourge of Estelion, Ares Extinction Agenda, Return All Robots, Mighty Milky Way, Mighty Flip Channel, uh, Champ, sorry, PPPPPPP, the VVVVVVVVOST, and Tree of Knowledge.

991
01:15:17,428 --> 01:15:17,668
[SPEAKER_04]: You said PP.

992
01:15:18,708 --> 01:15:29,233
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you contribute more than $10, you also get Wind Up Night, Binding of Isaac, 72 Minutes of Fame, Milk Snake, Anti-Gravity Extreme Road Trip, and Contingency.

993
01:15:29,573 --> 01:15:30,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, seriously?

994
01:15:30,713 --> 01:15:39,397
[SPEAKER_07]: For just the Super Meat Boy and VVVV or PPPV, whatever soundtracks, is like worth that whole dollar like 20 times over?

995
01:15:39,537 --> 01:15:40,998
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how I'd pronounce that?

996
01:15:41,238 --> 01:15:41,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

997
01:15:43,561 --> 01:15:49,024
[SPEAKER_07]: The VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV

998
01:16:07,904 --> 01:16:14,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so let's see, let's start off with some more cheerful stuff, hopefully.

999
01:16:17,628 --> 01:16:22,652
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, there may be a sequel to Command & Conquer possibly coming from Bioware.

1000
01:16:22,772 --> 01:16:33,121
[SPEAKER_08]: It was teased during a... They actually had a real brief video on teasing, I guess.

1001
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:35,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the Spike Video Games Awards, right around the corner.

1002
01:16:36,144 --> 01:16:39,186
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, there's also a screenshot that's out there.

1003
01:16:40,187 --> 01:16:40,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1004
01:16:41,508 --> 01:16:42,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1005
01:16:56,818 --> 01:16:57,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Victory Games.

1006
01:16:58,038 --> 01:17:03,440
[SPEAKER_08]: They're working on a new strategy title, which people are thinking, hmm, maybe that's what it's called.

1007
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:04,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Command & Conquer game?

1008
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:06,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, perhaps.

1009
01:17:08,301 --> 01:17:14,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I guess they have another Medal of Honor thing working with one of their other studios, Danger Close.

1010
01:17:15,284 --> 01:17:15,984
[SPEAKER_08]: So, lots of...

1011
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,521
[SPEAKER_08]: and different studios working under EA.

1012
01:17:20,581 --> 01:17:27,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember at one point, EA was just buying up, not necessarily buying up everybody, but publishing everybody.

1013
01:17:27,486 --> 01:17:37,071
[SPEAKER_08]: They have, obviously, the new Respawn Entertainment from the former execs of Infinity Ward.

1014
01:17:37,732 --> 01:17:38,632
[SPEAKER_08]: They're making something.

1015
01:17:38,692 --> 01:17:41,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, Valve is doing a lot of stuff with them.

1016
01:17:41,374 --> 01:17:42,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1017
01:17:44,588 --> 01:18:11,467
[SPEAKER_08]: and then Crytek as well lots of stuff there but at least the Bioware game now of course right now they don't know if Command & Conquer is really the game or not or if it's something else but the Bioware game is going to be revealed December 10th during the Spike Video Game Awards and like I said they had a very very very brief trailer of something with tanks it has tanks in it How do you feel about Command & Conquer with Dialogue Trees?

1018
01:18:14,724 --> 01:18:16,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Weren't you a big fan of Command & Conquer?

1019
01:18:16,245 --> 01:18:17,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I soon remember this.

1020
01:18:17,586 --> 01:18:18,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to be.

1021
01:18:18,346 --> 01:18:18,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Alert.

1022
01:18:19,007 --> 01:18:19,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Alert was awesome.

1023
01:18:20,368 --> 01:18:22,109
[SPEAKER_08]: But I haven't played Command & Conquer in a long time.

1024
01:18:22,889 --> 01:18:25,231
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, the last one that came out, I just didn't really care for.

1025
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:28,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it could be good, though.

1026
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:34,111
[SPEAKER_07]: If they turned it over to a new studio to kind of give it a creative energy reboot, that could be a good thing, right?

1027
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:34,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I'm not even sure.

1028
01:18:34,932 --> 01:18:36,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's a lot of studios working on stuff.

1029
01:18:36,852 --> 01:18:38,252
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be Bioware that's doing it.

1030
01:18:38,472 --> 01:18:40,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Bioware is actually going to be a different game altogether.

1031
01:18:41,473 --> 01:18:48,775
[SPEAKER_08]: The thought is, though, that Victory Games is going to be doing this, but I have no idea who the hell Victory Games is.

1032
01:18:49,575 --> 01:19:15,295
[SPEAKER_08]: so I guess they're a new strategy studio and you know strategy games for EA I mean really there's there was a Lord of the Rings games that they had and Command & Conquer so this Lord of the Rings is not part of you know EA anymore I'm gonna go on limb and say probably gonna be a Command & Conquer game at some point or maybe hey a new IP maybe a new IP you never know that could be too that'd be good

1033
01:19:16,724 --> 01:19:22,765
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, let's move on to another story, and this is about a possible answer to Smash Bros.

1034
01:19:22,845 --> 01:19:24,386
[SPEAKER_07]: that Sony is making.

1035
01:19:24,446 --> 01:19:25,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I should say this.

1036
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:27,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I always thought that Move game, what was that called?

1037
01:19:28,066 --> 01:19:31,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Move Fighters or something Fighters, the one that was on Sony?

1038
01:19:31,207 --> 01:19:34,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was supposed to be their answer to Smash Bros., but I guess not really.

1039
01:19:34,868 --> 01:19:35,028
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1040
01:19:35,348 --> 01:19:35,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one?

1041
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,949
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell is that game that's on Sony Move?

1042
01:19:38,289 --> 01:19:39,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it Pocket Fighters?

1043
01:19:39,329 --> 01:19:39,449
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1044
01:19:40,169 --> 01:19:42,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1045
01:19:56,056 --> 01:20:03,619
[SPEAKER_07]: There apparently is something a little more, I don't know if you want to say mainstream or what, but I guess something that's a little more directly, I don't want to say either a Smash Bros.

1046
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,381
[SPEAKER_07]: ripoff, but something that's supposedly in development.

1047
01:20:06,561 --> 01:20:12,303
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of stuff that's leaking through this blog called PaulGaleNetwork.com.

1048
01:20:12,363 --> 01:20:22,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure this gentleman's relation to the gaming industry, but a lot of the other gaming blogs have picked up and ran with this, where Title Fight is apparently the development...

1049
01:20:23,809 --> 01:20:25,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Work in Progress, name of this.

1050
01:20:25,869 --> 01:20:31,732
[SPEAKER_07]: And some information that's in this, it is very similar to Super Smash Bros.

1051
01:20:32,192 --> 01:20:35,594
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the special moves and all those attacks you kind of do the same way.

1052
01:20:37,355 --> 01:20:45,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently there are some characters already noticed in this, and they kind of come in light and heavy flavors, meaning like who moves slowly, who moves lightly.

1053
01:20:46,179 --> 01:20:49,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Heavier characters include Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal,

1054
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:52,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Colonel Male Reddick, Fat Princess.

1055
01:20:52,842 --> 01:20:55,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the lighter characters include Parappa the Rappa.

1056
01:20:56,023 --> 01:20:57,524
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of awesome if he's in a fighting game.

1057
01:20:57,804 --> 01:21:00,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Kratos, Sly Cooper, and Nathan Drake.

1058
01:21:01,506 --> 01:21:05,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, not sure if there's anything about, uh, a story mode or anything like that at this time.

1059
01:21:06,188 --> 01:21:06,968
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, yeah.

1060
01:21:07,408 --> 01:21:07,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, um...

1061
01:21:08,809 --> 01:21:09,969
[SPEAKER_07]: We need Michael Michael is the player of

1062
01:21:37,296 --> 01:21:41,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Who takes down the controller and it's all like be a part of the game or whatever.

1063
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:49,124
[SPEAKER_07]: And some people are saying maybe this is teasing this whole Sony smorgasbord of characters, this project.

1064
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:55,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I could certainly see this as being the big Sony reveal of next year's E3.

1065
01:21:55,908 --> 01:22:03,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now that the Vita will already be out there, maybe there's going to be something about this game and how it works between the Vita.

1066
01:22:03,614 --> 01:22:04,914
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be a Vita title for all we know.

1067
01:22:05,195 --> 01:22:07,116
[SPEAKER_07]: But how it works between the Vita and the PS3 and all that.

1068
01:22:07,616 --> 01:22:10,858
[SPEAKER_07]: So, could be neat, right?

1069
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:11,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be neat.

1070
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:14,760
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the idea of characters like Parappa the Rapper.

1071
01:22:14,981 --> 01:22:17,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I kind of forget about how many characters Sony really has in their pocket.

1072
01:22:17,822 --> 01:22:19,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if he's going to give you a paper cut.

1073
01:22:19,884 --> 01:22:20,444
[SPEAKER_07]: He might.

1074
01:22:20,804 --> 01:22:23,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be something he does, or Umjam Malami.

1075
01:22:23,926 --> 01:22:25,607
[SPEAKER_07]: If she's in it, I'm there.

1076
01:22:26,928 --> 01:22:27,508
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll see.

1077
01:22:28,128 --> 01:22:28,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Milk can!

1078
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:59,351
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah my guitar is in my mind it would be interesting to see too if they were able to get from some of the other developers you know kind of like how Smash Brothers had Solid Snake and what was it in the commercial Sonic Sonic hello was in the game it would be interesting to see if Sony could get things that were very iconically Sony like Cloud from Final Fantasy 7 Final Fantasy 7 was a huge Sony thing because that was when the franchise jumped over to Playstation could be interesting could be very interesting

1079
01:23:02,383 --> 01:23:02,663
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1080
01:23:03,084 --> 01:23:03,364
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1081
01:23:03,744 --> 01:23:04,344
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we doing now?

1082
01:23:04,424 --> 01:23:05,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on to some release dates, right?

1083
01:23:05,885 --> 01:23:10,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out to a store this week.

1084
01:23:10,168 --> 01:23:13,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I imagine it's dying down significantly, but let's see.

1085
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:15,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, incredibly dying down.

1086
01:23:16,493 --> 01:23:17,053
[SPEAKER_08]: A few things.

1087
01:23:17,073 --> 01:23:21,296
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some cool new combo packs they have with controller and game bundles.

1088
01:23:22,276 --> 01:23:47,071
[SPEAKER_08]: they did this kind of last year and so Sony's got some of those one of them is Encharted the dual pack with Encharted 1 and 2 and then you get a DualShock controller I believe that's blue and then they have one that's in black that comes with the Resistance 1 and 2 dual pack and there's also one with the God of War Origins collection that's I believe red those are all on Playstation 3 um

1089
01:23:50,493 --> 01:23:51,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

1090
01:23:51,174 --> 01:23:54,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Jaws Ultimate Predator on Wii and 3DS.

1091
01:23:55,638 --> 01:23:58,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Face Racers Photo Finish on 3DS.

1092
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:00,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Nano Assault on 3DS.

1093
01:24:00,883 --> 01:24:05,007
[SPEAKER_08]: But really the only 3DS game you should really care about is Mario Kart 7.

1094
01:24:05,727 --> 01:24:07,269
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's coming out one week from today.

1095
01:24:07,449 --> 01:24:07,829
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1096
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, one week from today?

1097
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:10,612
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

1098
01:24:10,632 --> 01:24:11,253
[SPEAKER_07]: One week from today.

1099
01:24:11,593 --> 01:24:12,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe it.

1100
01:24:13,086 --> 01:24:14,166
[SPEAKER_07]: XBOX 360 REVELATIONS

1101
01:24:35,674 --> 01:24:43,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic Generations, Shiro no Jiku is the subtitle for it over there, comes out this week, as well as King of Fighters 13 makes its way out in Japan this week.

1102
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:50,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, one other game on the 360 this week, a game called Ever 17 comes out in regular and limited edition flavors.

1103
01:24:51,405 --> 01:24:52,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what this game is all about.

1104
01:24:53,006 --> 01:25:04,274
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an adventure game, but I'm noticing it's, you know, anime chicks in schoolgirl outfits, and in this one clip, I kid you not, I'm looking, she's holding a hamster and talking to the hamster, so...

1105
01:25:05,282 --> 01:25:05,762
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1106
01:25:29,919 --> 01:25:31,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the third one's out.

1107
01:25:31,081 --> 01:25:35,285
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I start reading the entire Wiki, Evangelion Wiki.

1108
01:25:36,326 --> 01:25:37,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, oh, that's it.

1109
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:38,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.

1110
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

1111
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:46,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus comes out this week as well as the Sonic Generations and King of Fighters 13 releases.

1112
01:25:47,061 --> 01:25:49,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on the Sony system this week, Tekken Hybrid.

1113
01:25:50,122 --> 01:25:51,362
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I saw this at Target.

1114
01:25:51,702 --> 01:25:53,883
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a version here in America that I think just came out this week.

1115
01:25:54,423 --> 01:26:00,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had, like, Alan picked it up off the shelf and was like, I didn't know that this was coming out.

1116
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,084
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, shit, I didn't know about this one either.

1117
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:05,985
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, this is, what the hell, it's like tag tournament and...

1118
01:26:06,716 --> 01:26:08,079
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Tag Tournament HD.

1119
01:26:08,559 --> 01:26:19,078
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Tag Tournament 2 preview and then also Tech and Bullying, but I think that's also part of Tag Tournament.

1120
01:26:19,259 --> 01:26:19,699
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all in 3D.

1121
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:24,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, it's just those games.

1122
01:26:24,222 --> 01:26:31,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, it's also Tekken, the Tekken 3D animated movie that just came out as a 3D Blu-ray.

1123
01:26:31,888 --> 01:26:35,850
[SPEAKER_08]: So a hybrid as far as it's both a movie and both a game.

1124
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:41,794
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can even take that game and play it in a regular Blu-ray player and you can watch the movie in 3D if you want.

1125
01:26:42,435 --> 01:26:50,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you can just... What's great, though, is remember the new Tekken game that's coming out on the 3DS will also have that movie in 3D on it.

1126
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:51,842
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty cool.

1127
01:26:52,403 --> 01:26:53,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotta hit up my Namco guy.

1128
01:26:55,387 --> 01:27:00,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, just a reminder that PS Vita is three weeks away, December 17th.

1129
01:27:01,276 --> 01:27:02,058
[SPEAKER_08]: In Japan.

1130
01:27:02,098 --> 01:27:05,162
[SPEAKER_07]: In Japan, not here, but I am doing Japanese releases right now.

1131
01:27:06,303 --> 01:27:26,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony PSP this week since that's still the Sony system only big releases Kamen Rider Climax Heroes 4Z comes out this week that's from Namkai Bando and it's an action related title that looks like kind of a 3D-ish 3D-esque robot fighting game kind of like Ultraman style characters all fighting

1132
01:27:27,455 --> 01:27:28,896
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1133
01:27:52,935 --> 01:28:05,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Crayon Shin-chan, Uchu de Achu, Yuujou no Oba Karate Crayon Shin-chan is old school manga and anime What was the last part of that?

1134
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:18,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this No Oba Karate, it makes it sound like it's a karate crayon game And it is an action based game and it's based on that old anime Kind of like a platformer, looks a little bit like your Rayman kind of platformer game

1135
01:28:19,766 --> 01:28:25,250
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's it for releases in Japan.

1136
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:27,811
[SPEAKER_04]: For the UK, really not a whole bunch.

1137
01:28:29,332 --> 01:28:35,316
[SPEAKER_04]: We have on the 30th, Darkstalkers for PlayStation 3, which is kind of cool.

1138
01:28:35,916 --> 01:28:38,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on December 1st, there's Infinity Blade 2.

1139
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:48,544
[SPEAKER_04]: December 2nd, Ace Combat, Assault Horizon Legacy, Assassin's Creed Revelations for PC, Mario Kart 7, and Super Pokemon Rumble.

1140
01:28:49,284 --> 01:28:49,664
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1141
01:28:51,064 --> 01:28:54,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a few more stories for you guys and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

1142
01:28:54,385 --> 01:28:55,325
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, DarkSakura.

1143
01:28:56,025 --> 01:29:00,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there have been a lot of pre-orders for the Vita in Hong Kong.

1144
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:09,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, they are the second city that are getting the system.

1145
01:29:10,088 --> 01:29:16,650
[SPEAKER_04]: And, well, there's mobbing in online stores that can't meet the traffic and...

1146
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:19,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of stuff going on.

1147
01:29:20,958 --> 01:29:25,141
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's, I guess, not nearly as bad as getting pepper sprayed in the face over $2 waffle iron.

1148
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:31,705
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, what this basically means is that the early demand is there.

1149
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:33,666
[SPEAKER_07]: This could be kind of a big deal.

1150
01:29:34,226 --> 01:29:34,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Yarp.

1151
01:29:35,867 --> 01:29:36,748
[SPEAKER_04]: It could very well be.

1152
01:29:37,628 --> 01:29:39,269
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess that's really all we can say about it for now.

1153
01:29:39,589 --> 01:29:40,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1154
01:29:41,631 --> 01:29:45,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had any real reaction out of it, just that it's sold.

1155
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:47,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe people are just too busy hiding under their desk playing it.

1156
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:51,768
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting to know if the system's going to do well or if it's going to fall flat, so we'll see.

1157
01:29:53,709 --> 01:29:54,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully.

1158
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:56,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1159
01:29:57,031 --> 01:29:57,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I have high hopes for it.

1160
01:29:58,832 --> 01:30:00,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Seems to be doing pretty well.

1161
01:30:00,615 --> 01:30:02,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm definitely going to get one.

1162
01:30:03,177 --> 01:30:03,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1163
01:30:04,758 --> 01:30:08,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's been a lot of talk of piracy this week.

1164
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:16,044
[SPEAKER_08]: And one person, of course, to speak out about it is Gabe Newell, the head of Valve.

1165
01:30:16,705 --> 01:30:24,469
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, one of the things he says is piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem.

1166
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:32,274
[SPEAKER_08]: We think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy.

1167
01:30:32,354 --> 01:30:35,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Piracy is always a service problem, not a pricing problem.

1168
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:46,281
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, if a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24-7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says that the product is region-locked,

1169
01:30:46,681 --> 01:30:49,082
[SPEAKER_08]: will come to your country three months after a U.S.

1170
01:30:49,162 --> 01:30:54,024
[SPEAKER_08]: release and can only be purchased at a brick-and-mortar store, then the pirate service is more valuable.

1171
01:30:54,144 --> 01:31:01,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Most DRM solutions diminish the value of the product by either directly restricting a customer's use or by creating uncertainty.

1172
01:31:02,247 --> 01:31:13,952
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically kind of alluding to Assassin's Creed 2 and the Ubisoft DRM, which we mentioned earlier, pretty much got destroyed in a few months

1173
01:31:14,632 --> 01:31:15,233
[SPEAKER_08]: A few days.

1174
01:31:15,593 --> 01:31:20,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, you know, they're saying, you know, Steam isn't without its own problems.

1175
01:31:20,956 --> 01:31:31,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row the Third, you know, used, I guess, Steamworks and stuff and is unavailable on the UK Steam store for reasons that THQ are yet to elaborate on.

1176
01:31:31,603 --> 01:31:33,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So that kind of sucks that they don't have it yet.

1177
01:31:33,464 --> 01:31:34,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1178
01:31:36,112 --> 01:31:41,056
[SPEAKER_08]: but I mean Steam's not perfect either because their stuff gets pirated just as well.

1179
01:31:41,937 --> 01:31:44,539
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people seem to kind of be on board with Steam.

1180
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:45,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1181
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:46,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Sales help.

1182
01:31:46,421 --> 01:32:02,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to elaborate real quick because it's not one of the stories that we had earlier but some other people were talking piracy and funny enough it's also Ubisoft and their latest game to be coming out well

1183
01:32:03,195 --> 01:32:06,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Ever delayed game to be coming out, I Am Alive.

1184
01:32:10,063 --> 01:32:15,830
[SPEAKER_08]: They were saying that, well, we're not going to put it on PC because... Piracy issues.

1185
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:16,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically...

1186
01:32:18,152 --> 01:32:29,335
[SPEAKER_08]: The creative director, Stanislas Metra, has basically said that PC piracy makes the financial viability of a game on the platform uncertain.

1187
01:32:29,755 --> 01:32:34,796
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ubisoft's previously announced title, I guess, is only planned for consoles.

1188
01:32:34,816 --> 01:32:36,136
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, that would be I Am Alive.

1189
01:32:36,496 --> 01:32:44,698
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, we heard loud and clear that PC gamers are bitching about there being no version for them.

1190
01:32:45,006 --> 01:32:48,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting that they used bitching in their official statement.

1191
01:32:48,688 --> 01:33:00,135
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, but are these people just making noise because there's no version or because it's a game they actually want to play?

1192
01:33:00,695 --> 01:33:02,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Would they buy it if we made it?

1193
01:33:02,556 --> 01:33:12,302
[SPEAKER_08]: And he continues saying that if 50,000 PC players buy the game, it's not worth the cost of putting a team of 12 on the project for three months.

1194
01:33:14,563 --> 01:33:25,867
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard because there's so much piracy and so few people are playing PC games that we have to precisely weigh it up against the cost of making it.

1195
01:33:26,387 --> 01:33:28,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, that pissed off everybody.

1196
01:33:28,928 --> 01:33:29,688
[SPEAKER_08]: All sorts of people.

1197
01:33:31,429 --> 01:33:39,852
[SPEAKER_08]: What's great, though, is shortly afterwards, after everyone completely complained about that, he backpedaled on that.

1198
01:33:39,932 --> 01:33:40,893
[SPEAKER_08]: He's saying...

1199
01:33:43,871 --> 01:33:45,272
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, let's see here.

1200
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:53,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, which game maker would not love to see his game to be playable on as many platforms and as by many people as possible?

1201
01:33:57,413 --> 01:33:58,554
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1202
01:34:18,335 --> 01:34:29,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet, and even though the company's not very vocal about this, and for good reason, obviously you see all this backlash, I honestly truly believe a big part of the delay for PC was so that consoles got the jump.

1203
01:34:29,841 --> 01:34:37,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's all about playing it, and this goes back to Gabe Newell's point about convenience and getting it as soon as possible and the releases and all that.

1204
01:34:37,725 --> 01:34:38,946
[SPEAKER_07]: People want to play it now.

1205
01:34:39,646 --> 01:34:43,289
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think because it's on the consoles early, I think it really helps.

1206
01:34:43,369 --> 01:34:48,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, nothing's ever going to stop piracy, but I think it helps turn a lot of people away from it.

1207
01:34:49,955 --> 01:34:52,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, certainly piracy happens on the consoles too, but it's a lot harder.

1208
01:34:52,837 --> 01:34:57,381
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ubisoft further digs into themselves deeper by...

1209
01:34:58,101 --> 01:35:02,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Skipping Ghost Recon Future Soldier on PC as well because piracy.

1210
01:35:02,884 --> 01:35:06,606
[SPEAKER_08]: They even said they're going to do Ghost Recon Online.

1211
01:35:07,466 --> 01:35:19,452
[SPEAKER_08]: When we started Ghost Recon Online, we were thinking about Ghost Recon Future Soldier having something ported in the classic way without any deep development because we know that 95% of our consumers will pirate the game.

1212
01:35:19,592 --> 01:35:21,914
[SPEAKER_08]: So we said, okay, we'll have to change our mind.

1213
01:35:22,654 --> 01:35:27,966
[SPEAKER_08]: well that's very positive that your game you feel it's just going to be pirated like crazy

1214
01:35:33,611 --> 01:35:37,513
[SPEAKER_08]: We're giving away most of the content for free because there's no barrier to entry.

1215
01:35:37,653 --> 01:35:40,514
[SPEAKER_08]: This is talking about Ghost Recon Online.

1216
01:35:41,754 --> 01:35:49,857
[SPEAKER_08]: To the users that are traditionally playing the game by getting it through Pirate Bay, we said, okay, go ahead, guys.

1217
01:35:49,917 --> 01:35:52,038
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what you're asking for.

1218
01:35:52,098 --> 01:35:52,898
[SPEAKER_08]: We've listened to you.

1219
01:35:53,258 --> 01:35:54,639
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to give you this experience.

1220
01:35:54,699 --> 01:35:55,659
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easy to download.

1221
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:57,780
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no DRM that will pollute your experience.

1222
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:01,762
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, they're like, well, there's nothing we can do, so we're just going to stop.

1223
01:36:01,782 --> 01:36:03,223
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've designed a free-to-play game.

1224
01:36:03,543 --> 01:36:03,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1225
01:36:04,703 --> 01:36:05,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting tactic.

1226
01:36:05,844 --> 01:36:12,427
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, as much as I think people want to hate this guy, I think it's somewhat of a fair response.

1227
01:36:13,628 --> 01:36:14,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do.

1228
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:18,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that is, but I am sorry.

1229
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:20,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I am alive, though.

1230
01:36:21,572 --> 01:36:22,692
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, it's running in older.

1231
01:36:22,752 --> 01:36:25,133
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like they have to create the engine totally from scratch.

1232
01:36:25,173 --> 01:36:26,713
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Splinter Cell Conviction engine.

1233
01:36:27,814 --> 01:36:34,456
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's also a game that's been delayed and delayed and delayed, and I don't think it's a game that really a lot of people are like, oh my god, I gotta play this.

1234
01:36:35,656 --> 01:36:39,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're just pissed off that they're saying, oh, well, no one plays PC games.

1235
01:36:40,178 --> 01:36:41,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot of people who disagree with you.

1236
01:36:43,038 --> 01:36:43,318
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1237
01:36:43,478 --> 01:36:49,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to our chat room for some comments on some various stories we've been talking about because obviously we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1238
01:36:49,924 --> 01:36:50,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Except everyone.

1239
01:36:51,165 --> 01:37:00,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually our chat room is at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, but due to website issues tonight, we are giving you the long way of getting there, which is going on to IRC, the Game Surge Network, and we are at Channel Orange Lounge.

1240
01:37:00,774 --> 01:37:01,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you know what?

1241
01:37:01,354 --> 01:37:06,639
[SPEAKER_07]: For real, if you really don't know how to get there, just go to chat.allgames.com and ask them, how do I join Orange Lounge?

1242
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:07,119
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll tell you.

1243
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:07,720
[SPEAKER_07]: They're nice.

1244
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,301
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1245
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:35,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting perspective because you might say, oh no, that can't be it.

1246
01:37:35,711 --> 01:37:37,451
[SPEAKER_07]: But that kind of shit happens in America too.

1247
01:37:38,012 --> 01:37:40,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when the Wii's first came out and hell, the Xboxes.

1248
01:37:41,172 --> 01:37:46,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when people were buying up the limited Xbox supplies and then reselling them for twice as much?

1249
01:37:46,494 --> 01:37:48,694
[SPEAKER_07]: This shit happens with new tech all the time.

1250
01:37:48,794 --> 01:37:50,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So I could believe that.

1251
01:37:51,295 --> 01:37:53,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I can actually really believe that.

1252
01:37:53,156 --> 01:37:53,736
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

1253
01:37:53,796 --> 01:37:57,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that isn't necessarily an indicator of how strong something's going to sell because...

1254
01:37:58,277 --> 01:38:16,823
[SPEAKER_07]: people tried to do that with the 3DS and it didn't work so well for them I don't think they made money on that so there you go Kaijudo in chat says there is only one way to stop piracy make everything free yes Kaijudo I need you to make me a sandwich and don't you expect me to pay you for it just teasing

1255
01:38:18,584 --> 01:38:20,366
[SPEAKER_07]: But he does go on to say it will never happen.

1256
01:38:20,767 --> 01:38:23,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Piracy will never... It will never happen.

1257
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:26,874
[SPEAKER_07]: No one will... Nowhere will piracy ever stop.

1258
01:38:27,114 --> 01:38:30,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So please stop torturing us with your shitty attempts at DRM.

1259
01:38:33,436 --> 01:38:33,736
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1260
01:38:34,758 --> 01:38:35,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

1261
01:38:52,955 --> 01:39:00,941
[SPEAKER_07]: from a website, damlag.com, and it's an article about game developers, you need to take your demos more seriously.

1262
01:39:01,562 --> 01:39:07,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, now that I'm trying to bring it up in studio, it's not loading, the joys of live radio and internet timeouts.

1263
01:39:08,768 --> 01:39:10,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I did read the article a little bit before the show.

1264
01:39:12,551 --> 01:39:15,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I think an ad is trying to prevent this thing from popping up all the way or something.

1265
01:39:16,814 --> 01:39:17,655
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet's working.

1266
01:39:18,055 --> 01:39:18,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

1267
01:39:18,455 --> 01:39:19,616
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the internet's working fine.

1268
01:39:20,757 --> 01:39:21,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing!

1269
01:39:23,445 --> 01:39:24,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn people

1270
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:33,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So apparently this demo is talking about the Rayman Origins demo had recently... Oh, it's working for you?

1271
01:39:33,495 --> 01:39:34,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.

1272
01:39:34,136 --> 01:39:35,377
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not coming up on the computer over there.

1273
01:39:35,757 --> 01:39:35,997
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1274
01:39:36,518 --> 01:39:40,421
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's talking about how the Rayman Origins demo was really good.

1275
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:49,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And the author of the article at Damlag.com was talking about how he's played through the demo several times and how it's just a great game.

1276
01:39:49,289 --> 01:39:51,450
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of has elements of New Super Mario Bros.

1277
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:54,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii and mixing with the original Rayman and so forth.

1278
01:39:55,534 --> 01:39:57,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really know about this game before.

1279
01:39:57,916 --> 01:40:02,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I heard a little bit about it at E3, but I'm kind of throwing this in there.

1280
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's face it, it's a really crowded time of year.

1281
01:40:05,162 --> 01:40:06,743
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of video games out right now.

1282
01:40:06,763 --> 01:40:08,284
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really kind of hard to get the attention.

1283
01:40:09,225 --> 01:40:15,770
[SPEAKER_07]: The article talks about how developers usually think a demo is an afterthought if they even bother to put one out at all.

1284
01:40:16,651 --> 01:40:34,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then talks about, you know, the article goes on to talk about how, um, you know, if, if you can get a customer to really experience the game, or even a demo that's mid-game, citing like Heavenly Sword, something that kind of takes not just the beginning of the game, but something that's a little bit in the middle of the game, um, that's a really good demo.

1285
01:40:35,288 --> 01:40:36,028
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some...

1286
01:40:37,069 --> 01:40:37,309
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

1287
01:40:50,791 --> 01:40:53,213
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever happened to a good old-fashioned demo?

1288
01:40:53,233 --> 01:40:55,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a lot of games don't even bother with them.

1289
01:40:55,074 --> 01:40:59,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Peggle Extreme, I mean, if you want to look at that, that came out with all of the Valve branding on it.

1290
01:41:00,758 --> 01:41:09,183
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was, in essence, a free demo because it says, hey, if you really liked playing this, and you get, you know, I think like 10 levels or so of Peggle.

1291
01:41:09,804 --> 01:41:12,946
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, hey, if you like this, you know, try out the real thing.

1292
01:41:13,006 --> 01:41:13,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

1293
01:41:15,247 --> 01:41:17,208
[SPEAKER_04]: So PopCap did it.

1294
01:41:17,509 --> 01:41:17,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1295
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:26,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the reason why I wanted to talk about this story a little bit is I kind of wanted to ask you guys, how important is a demo for you guys in influencing your game buying decisions?

1296
01:41:27,214 --> 01:41:29,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, do you like to use reviews?

1297
01:41:29,215 --> 01:41:31,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you just kind of jump in if it's cheap?

1298
01:41:31,536 --> 01:41:33,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you use game demos or what?

1299
01:41:33,877 --> 01:41:37,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll kind of answer this is that I do like game demos.

1300
01:41:38,058 --> 01:41:41,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they're necessarily the most important thing in selling a game.

1301
01:41:42,045 --> 01:42:10,518
[SPEAKER_07]: because I think especially now that we live in a day and age where we have like Gamefly and hell even now streaming games thanks to like OnLive and so forth OnLive especially is interesting because now your demo can just be oh play an hour of it for free or something like what Steam did over the weekend with Magica so I think there's a lot of that evolving but I'm not going to lie a really good demo can absolutely sell a game absolutely because it leaves you wanting more you know

1302
01:42:11,218 --> 01:42:16,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, on top of that, you also get an idea of edits that they've made in games, too.

1303
01:42:16,599 --> 01:42:20,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of times a demo's not going to have all the edits that make it into the final game.

1304
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:27,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are clever and can get into the information on the disc, you can get more out of it.

1305
01:42:28,442 --> 01:42:32,283
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, we've got a pile of PlayStation Magazine demos in the vault.

1306
01:42:32,683 --> 01:42:34,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, those PlayStation demos are always the bomb.

1307
01:42:34,485 --> 01:42:35,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are great.

1308
01:42:35,466 --> 01:42:36,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played so much Jumping Flash.

1309
01:42:38,408 --> 01:42:42,432
[SPEAKER_04]: From the demo disc that came with my friend's ex-boyfriend's PlayStation.

1310
01:42:42,692 --> 01:42:48,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how many people bought, what was it, like Brave Fencer Mushashi or whatever just because it came with a Final Fantasy VIII demo?

1311
01:42:48,577 --> 01:42:49,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1312
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:52,941
[SPEAKER_07]: What game got the Final Fantasy VII demo?

1313
01:42:53,822 --> 01:42:54,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't remember.

1314
01:42:54,383 --> 01:42:56,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Tobal.

1315
01:42:56,465 --> 01:42:56,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Tobal.

1316
01:42:58,906 --> 01:43:00,407
[SPEAKER_07]: and that sold a lot just because of the demo too.

1317
01:43:00,427 --> 01:43:01,628
[SPEAKER_04]: But Toeball actually wasn't a bad game.

1318
01:43:01,988 --> 01:43:02,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

1319
01:43:03,049 --> 01:43:04,570
[SPEAKER_08]: I really wish they'd make a new Toeball.

1320
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:05,790
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a second one.

1321
01:43:05,850 --> 01:43:10,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I know they did a second one and it was awesome but I really wish they'd make a new Toeball.

1322
01:43:11,373 --> 01:43:16,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Actdeft says, I usually ask people.

1323
01:43:17,036 --> 01:43:20,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Jvmon says, I use demos for franchises I'm not familiar with.

1324
01:43:20,358 --> 01:43:24,441
[SPEAKER_07]: If it wasn't for demos, I would never have bought Blue Dragon or Cold Step Saga.

1325
01:43:25,381 --> 01:43:26,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Cold Step Saga is awesome.

1326
01:43:27,102 --> 01:43:34,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Coldstep Saga is an interesting one because I didn't play the demo for that but a friend of mine got me into that and was like this is the best game ever and nobody's ever heard of it and it's true.

1327
01:43:35,124 --> 01:43:39,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never heard anything about that game but it's like freaking Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.

1328
01:43:39,365 --> 01:43:40,265
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually kind of awesome.

1329
01:43:41,185 --> 01:43:43,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaijudo says demo made me buy Just Cause 2.

1330
01:43:43,926 --> 01:43:44,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that game.

1331
01:43:45,246 --> 01:43:49,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Hitstun goes so far as to make a little graph here.

1332
01:43:49,667 --> 01:43:51,928
[SPEAKER_07]: My usual considerations when buying games.

1333
01:43:52,588 --> 01:43:55,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Friends playing greater than reviews, greater than

1334
01:43:56,189 --> 01:43:59,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Price greater than hype greater than demo.

1335
01:44:00,015 --> 01:44:02,098
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of putting demo towards the end of the chain there.

1336
01:44:02,972 --> 01:44:09,437
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I honestly, because my friends have kind of different tastes all across the board.

1337
01:44:09,957 --> 01:44:13,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So one person may like something, and I've turned out to completely hate it.

1338
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:15,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because it's just how it is.

1339
01:44:16,182 --> 01:44:22,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe in making a judgment until I've played some of it, you know, or seen it played.

1340
01:44:22,947 --> 01:44:28,091
[SPEAKER_04]: So demos and, you know, online videos of a game really...

1341
01:44:29,995 --> 01:44:34,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Do more for me than relying on another person's opinion, if that makes sense.

1342
01:44:34,377 --> 01:44:42,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I disrespect my friends' opinions, but it's just, honestly, there's games that a lot of people love that I'm like, what the hell?

1343
01:44:43,181 --> 01:44:46,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'll be perfectly honest, I'm kind of not all that into Skyrim.

1344
01:44:48,533 --> 01:44:49,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

1345
01:45:13,163 --> 01:45:17,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, but then Technus kind of gives us our final thought on this story here.

1346
01:45:17,570 --> 01:45:20,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I think not enough companies make demos for their games.

1347
01:45:21,375 --> 01:45:23,819
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a lot of work though to turn out a demo, I mean...

1348
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:52,124
[SPEAKER_07]: but yeah, I think people discover games in many different ways, and a good demo is certainly one of them, but a bad demo can really damn your game, you know, one other thing I guess I want to open this, because I'm not so sure the article got into talking about this, but I think when it comes to the Xbox Live Arcade games or PlayStation Network games, those demos can really make or break the damn game I really do make my decisions based off those demos I play those demos a lot, I really do um

1349
01:45:53,725 --> 01:45:56,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think those demos are really important.

1350
01:45:56,607 --> 01:46:00,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Because especially when it's so easy, just press X to upgrade.

1351
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:01,870
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1352
01:46:02,370 --> 01:46:04,132
[SPEAKER_07]: How easy is that if you really enjoy a demo?

1353
01:46:05,352 --> 01:46:10,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, we're going to now take a moment to dive into gaming history.

1354
01:46:11,736 --> 01:46:13,637
[SPEAKER_07]: with the classic Game of the Week segment.

1355
01:46:13,697 --> 01:46:14,997
[SPEAKER_07]: No demo needed here.

1356
01:46:15,357 --> 01:46:17,237
[SPEAKER_07]: You play it because DarkSakura said so.

1357
01:46:17,657 --> 01:46:20,038
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the classic Game of the Week.

1358
01:46:20,118 --> 01:46:21,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting choice this week.

1359
01:46:21,378 --> 01:46:23,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that you picked the music from the first one on the list.

1360
01:46:24,739 --> 01:46:27,620
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no list this week, DarkSakura, because of the website.

1361
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:28,760
[SPEAKER_04]: But I told you what the game was.

1362
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:32,121
[SPEAKER_07]: You did, so hopefully this is the right one.

1363
01:46:32,141 --> 01:46:32,441
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1364
01:46:33,061 --> 01:46:33,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Just play.

1365
01:46:35,562 --> 01:46:38,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the game of the week is called Three Wonders.

1366
01:46:39,042 --> 01:46:40,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Or as it was in Japan, Wonder 3.

1367
01:46:41,803 --> 01:46:44,303
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an arcade game that was made by Capcom in 1991.

1368
01:46:44,383 --> 01:46:45,844
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a PS1 game.

1369
01:46:46,344 --> 01:46:47,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can choose three games in it.

1370
01:46:48,324 --> 01:46:52,045
[SPEAKER_04]: You have Midnight Wanderer's Quest for the Chariot, which in Japan is called Roosters.

1371
01:46:53,045 --> 01:46:57,846
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has a hobbit named Lou and Shiva in it.

1372
01:46:57,926 --> 01:47:02,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I want to still say Shiva because that's how it would have been pronounced in the Japanese version.

1373
01:47:03,287 --> 01:47:08,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's Chariot Adventure Through the Sky, which is also just called Chariot in Japan, and then Don't Pull.

1374
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:13,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Midnight Wanderers is a platform game, and it's actually really, really cool.

1375
01:47:13,832 --> 01:47:16,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I've watched Dan play it a number of times, and I've played it a little bit myself.

1376
01:47:17,033 --> 01:47:17,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty fun.

1377
01:47:17,994 --> 01:47:26,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Chariot is a shmup where you have Lou and Shiva as well, and then Don't Pull is kind of like Pango.

1378
01:47:26,858 --> 01:47:30,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pulling puzzle-type game.

1379
01:47:31,785 --> 01:47:35,188
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out in 1998 on the Sega Saturn and on the PlayStation.

1380
01:47:35,628 --> 01:47:39,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Capcom re-released it in 2006 on the Capcom Classics Collection Vol.

1381
01:47:39,931 --> 01:47:45,855
[SPEAKER_04]: 2 on PS2 and Xbox and Capcom Classics Collection Remix for the PSP.

1382
01:47:46,536 --> 01:47:49,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, there's not a whole bunch to say because they're...

1383
01:47:50,919 --> 01:47:51,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, Dan!

1384
01:47:51,279 --> 01:47:53,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Get in here and tell us about the game!

1385
01:48:21,615 --> 01:48:22,276
[SPEAKER_04]: He said no.

1386
01:48:22,416 --> 01:48:24,618
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a butthead.

1387
01:48:25,558 --> 01:48:29,961
[SPEAKER_04]: But it really is very bright, vivid colors.

1388
01:48:30,001 --> 01:48:30,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Very pretty.

1389
01:48:30,822 --> 01:48:31,983
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great game.

1390
01:48:33,024 --> 01:48:37,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Lou also made it as an assist character for Marvel vs. Capcom.

1391
01:48:38,467 --> 01:48:44,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And he basically looks exactly like he did in Midnight Wanderers.

1392
01:48:45,452 --> 01:48:46,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he...

1393
01:48:51,642 --> 01:48:57,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Shiva was actually, um, well, there was a character based on him for, uh, Cannon Spike.

1394
01:48:57,710 --> 01:49:00,413
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called Shiba Shintaro, who was based off of him.

1395
01:49:01,094 --> 01:49:02,415
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, that's really it.

1396
01:49:02,515 --> 01:49:04,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's kind of a no-brainer.

1397
01:49:04,638 --> 01:49:05,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone should play this game.

1398
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:09,404
[SPEAKER_04]: But, really, everyone should just be playing the Midnight Wanderers part of the game.

1399
01:49:11,443 --> 01:49:14,265
[SPEAKER_07]: So the classic game of the week is Three Wonders.

1400
01:49:14,646 --> 01:49:16,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you want, it's just Midnight Wonders, really.

1401
01:49:17,628 --> 01:49:18,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.

1402
01:49:18,389 --> 01:49:19,570
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, Shuri's not bad.

1403
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:20,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Shuri's not bad.

1404
01:49:20,671 --> 01:49:22,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know, the puzzle game kind of pisses me off.

1405
01:49:23,633 --> 01:49:25,395
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, I suck at Pango.

1406
01:49:27,176 --> 01:49:29,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Pango, so I would actually check out the puzzler.

1407
01:49:29,598 --> 01:49:30,900
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like kind of cool.

1408
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:31,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1409
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:34,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And if anyone finds a Three Wonders machine, freaking take a picture of it for me.

1410
01:49:35,686 --> 01:49:37,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've never even heard of this game.

1411
01:49:37,748 --> 01:49:38,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I really haven't.

1412
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:40,911
[SPEAKER_07]: And it even runs on, like, Capcom hardware.

1413
01:49:40,931 --> 01:49:42,272
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd think this thing would be everywhere, so.

1414
01:49:42,292 --> 01:49:45,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can, I mean, you can run it on main, but easy.

1415
01:49:45,155 --> 01:49:46,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, emulator, easy, but.

1416
01:49:46,777 --> 01:49:47,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1417
01:49:48,478 --> 01:49:50,240
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's really neat, but yeah.

1418
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:54,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just the star of the collection is Midnight Wonders.

1419
01:49:54,524 --> 01:49:55,064
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, there you go.

1420
01:49:55,084 --> 01:49:58,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Your classic game of the week, Three Wonders in the arcade.

1421
01:49:58,888 --> 01:49:59,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Never on a console, right?

1422
01:50:00,473 --> 01:50:24,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said it came out on consoles Sorry, I was trying to deal with another issue It came out in 1998 on the Saturn and Playstation Oh nice, okay And then we got re-releases in 2006 for the Playstation 2 and Xbox which was the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 Ah, that's right PSP is Capcom Classics Collection Remixed Alright Very, very awesome thing to have

1423
01:50:25,422 --> 01:50:45,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well we're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere guys, we'll be right back with part B of our show, which might be a little bit shorter, but that just means more time for calls, and coming up tonight, a list list, and we'll tell you guys the topic when we come back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1424
01:50:52,375 --> 01:51:01,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio for the second half of our show, live on November the 27th of 2011 at All Games Radio.

1425
01:51:01,181 --> 01:51:03,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, our website's busted right now.

1426
01:51:03,623 --> 01:51:11,948
[SPEAKER_07]: If you try to visit it at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, you get a message that implies we haven't paid a bill, but trust me, if it was that easy to fix, we would have done it for the show.

1427
01:51:11,988 --> 01:51:22,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind our website is graciously donated, but you can't complain about free, so we just kind of have to wait for things to work themselves out behind the scenes.

1428
01:51:22,675 --> 01:51:27,979
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyhow, moving on, we are still trying to tape a show so that whenever our website does get back up, we can podcast it.

1429
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:30,822
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're having fun with our live listeners who are in our chat room.

1430
01:51:31,142 --> 01:51:35,846
[SPEAKER_07]: You still can't get to our chat room even without chat.orangelingeradio.com, which you can do.

1431
01:51:36,246 --> 01:51:37,387
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go to...

1432
01:51:39,068 --> 01:51:56,071
[SPEAKER_07]: any IRC client look up Game Surge which is at irc.gamesurge.net and join Channel Orange Lounge you can also do that through the All Games chat client so if you just go over to chat.allgames.com if you really want something online just join Channel Orange Lounge from there it's really easy

1433
01:51:56,511 --> 01:51:57,612
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1434
01:52:17,589 --> 01:52:39,095
[SPEAKER_07]: so get your tweets in if you haven't already sent those in twitter.com slash OLR no rapid fire news tonight we're just going to get right into some longer news we'll start with oh I wanted to actually I did want to talk about this quickly we talked about like Black Friday stuff a little bit already and just kind of like some of the craziness that was going on out there

1435
01:52:40,056 --> 01:52:54,635
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the stories that I had actually kind of grabbed Was about folks that were actually pepper sprayed in the face And slammed and all this stuff I think a lot of you guys heard about this I'm sure it was all over the news Some chick that was trying to get an Xbox Actually pepper sprayed people trying to get to it

1436
01:52:55,075 --> 01:52:57,778
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, people are just getting crazy out there.

1437
01:52:59,159 --> 01:53:03,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I have zero desire to participate in any of this type of Black Friday antics, but I noticed it.

1438
01:53:03,583 --> 01:53:12,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I was leaving a Thanksgiving dinner in the Bay Area at about 1130, and I had to drive my friend that lives there, lives right by that Fry's in Fremont.

1439
01:53:13,431 --> 01:53:15,052
[SPEAKER_07]: or maybe it's actually Milpitas at that point.

1440
01:53:15,072 --> 01:53:15,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Milpitas.

1441
01:53:15,992 --> 01:53:34,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I had to literally drive right by that and yeah, parking lot was a madhouse and there was already a line at 1130, you know, and it just, I was like, I do not want to be anywhere near here and it's funny because you have Fry's on the left side of the road and then Walmart on the right side of the road and so like all the cars in the left turn lane were backed up and all the cars in the right turn lane were backed up.

1442
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,321
[SPEAKER_07]: The only clear lane was the middle.

1443
01:53:36,681 --> 01:53:46,823
[SPEAKER_07]: you could zoom right down through the middle and get back on the freeway which is right there I for one would never be out in this kind of madness I didn't leave the house I don't blame you

1444
01:53:47,332 --> 01:53:47,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1445
01:54:07,348 --> 01:54:12,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I am much more of a fan of Cyber Monday, which is coming up tomorrow.

1446
01:54:12,291 --> 01:54:14,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess some of the sales are out there already.

1447
01:54:14,492 --> 01:54:16,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait till they figure out how to pepper spray you through the computer.

1448
01:54:20,115 --> 01:54:21,235
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always that Tumblr.

1449
01:54:21,295 --> 01:54:22,716
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see that pepper spray guy.

1450
01:54:22,876 --> 01:54:25,258
[SPEAKER_07]: All it was pepper spray cop, pepper spraying cop, that Tumblr.

1451
01:54:26,879 --> 01:54:27,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I want to mention this.

1452
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:34,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Another great way to save money is through the sales online through services like Steam, who just had a pretty awesome sale, I got to say.

1453
01:54:35,287 --> 01:54:37,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal 2 was $10 on Wednesday.

1454
01:54:38,571 --> 01:54:41,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Civilization 5 was $10 yesterday.

1455
01:54:41,774 --> 01:54:42,995
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been having some really good sales.

1456
01:54:43,015 --> 01:54:44,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys have picked anything up.

1457
01:54:44,657 --> 01:54:45,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually didn't...

1458
01:54:45,678 --> 01:54:50,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to admit, a lot of the games that were on sale that I would have bought, I already bought at full price earlier.

1459
01:54:50,904 --> 01:54:53,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't really indulge in the sale, except I did buy some DLC.

1460
01:54:53,868 --> 01:54:57,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought some Civ V DLC that I hadn't picked up before during the sale.

1461
01:54:57,973 --> 01:55:02,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you guys purchase anything through these sales?

1462
01:55:02,848 --> 01:55:03,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

1463
01:55:03,509 --> 01:55:03,749
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

1464
01:55:04,589 --> 01:55:04,790
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

1465
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:06,371
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

1466
01:55:06,391 --> 01:55:08,652
[SPEAKER_07]: What about you guys in our chatroom at chat.northwestradio.com?

1467
01:55:08,673 --> 01:55:14,217
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I tried to poll the people on our Google+, our new Google Plus page, and I kind of got a very similar response.

1468
01:55:14,297 --> 01:55:16,719
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, nah, didn't want to be out fighting in it.

1469
01:55:17,019 --> 01:55:19,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a better time just kind of pointing and laughing at people.

1470
01:55:19,301 --> 01:55:23,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned my lesson from going to some Black Friday stuff.

1471
01:55:23,243 --> 01:55:27,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily lining up at midnight or something, but just going there during the day.

1472
01:55:28,207 --> 01:55:47,016
[SPEAKER_08]: and I remember the last time I actually went out well there was two times there was one where I went out because I actually needed some DVD-Rs and so I went to Best Buy it wasn't actually that bad it was just like normal Saturday traffic I think as long as you're not there like an hour or two before or after opening it's fine

1473
01:55:47,426 --> 01:55:48,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so that was that.

1474
01:55:49,347 --> 01:55:53,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I went to Fry's one time because I was looking for something.

1475
01:55:53,948 --> 01:55:56,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember exactly what now, but Fry's was terrible.

1476
01:55:57,069 --> 01:56:06,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like in the afternoon on Black Friday and the line was just like an hour and a half long for whatever.

1477
01:56:07,353 --> 01:56:27,354
[SPEAKER_08]: and I mean that's bad when they have like 30 registers open or something but and that line is still that long it was really bad and they had a guy walking around the balloon that a giant like weather balloon says line ends here and he's basically this line just snakes through the entire store

1478
01:56:28,035 --> 01:56:29,096
[SPEAKER_08]: It's ridiculous.

1479
01:56:29,356 --> 01:56:29,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy.

1480
01:56:29,936 --> 01:56:32,157
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I don't really like doing that stuff.

1481
01:56:32,217 --> 01:56:44,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And even the recent games I've got, I actually have Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 that I got for free and Skyrim I got for free because every now and then the publisher likes to actually send us stuff.

1482
01:56:45,322 --> 01:56:50,744
[SPEAKER_08]: So I played that, but I'm not going to buy any new stuff.

1483
01:56:50,764 --> 01:56:51,505
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, actually...

1484
01:56:52,685 --> 01:56:55,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not going to buy any new games for a long time.

1485
01:56:55,566 --> 01:56:58,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know what the next new game I'd probably get.

1486
01:56:58,688 --> 01:57:00,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Borderlands 2, but that's about it.

1487
01:57:00,628 --> 01:57:01,629
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to buy Mario Kart.

1488
01:57:02,389 --> 01:57:03,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have a credit on Amazon, though.

1489
01:57:03,950 --> 01:57:06,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seriously thinking of trading in Modern Warfare 3 for...

1490
01:57:09,813 --> 01:57:27,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd probably lean more towards Super Mario Land 3D than I would Mario Kart because Mario Kart's kind of it's the same stuff all over again they're like repeating old classic tracks instead of coming up with original stuff and then adding the classic tracks

1491
01:57:29,938 --> 01:57:31,579
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a couple comments in our chat rooms.

1492
01:57:31,839 --> 01:57:38,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Evil, or E3VL, which I think he is evil, is in our chat saying, is the Cyber Monday sale separate from the Autumn sale on Steam?

1493
01:57:39,303 --> 01:57:42,664
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm not sure if Steam's going to do something separate on Monday.

1494
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:43,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't anticipate it.

1495
01:57:44,085 --> 01:57:48,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's also, remember, the Amazon Gold Box sales, which are always really good.

1496
01:57:48,948 --> 01:57:52,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Cyber Monday is actually an internet-wide thing.

1497
01:57:52,110 --> 01:57:56,932
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of the internet's response to Black Friday because Monday is when everybody goes back to work.

1498
01:57:57,372 --> 01:58:00,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess there's this perception that nobody actually works when they go back to work.

1499
01:58:00,694 --> 01:58:02,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, they're online shopping all day.

1500
01:58:02,996 --> 01:58:04,316
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty accurate sometimes.

1501
01:58:04,536 --> 01:58:07,078
[SPEAKER_07]: All these companies do these big online sales on Monday.

1502
01:58:07,158 --> 01:58:07,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1503
01:58:07,598 --> 01:58:11,681
[SPEAKER_07]: It's totally a man-made, invented thing, but hey, any excuse for a sale, right?

1504
01:58:12,261 --> 01:58:14,023
[SPEAKER_07]: So Steam may get in on it.

1505
01:58:14,623 --> 01:58:16,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Microsoft is supposed to be doing something.

1506
01:58:17,825 --> 01:58:20,687
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been doing some sales on Xbox Live all week.

1507
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:22,008
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get things like Bejeweled 3.

1508
01:58:23,669 --> 01:58:24,730
[SPEAKER_07]: God, some game was only like 240.

1509
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:27,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I think it's Bejeweled Blitz or something.

1510
01:58:27,552 --> 01:58:30,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only like 240 Microsoft points, which is about what it's worth.

1511
01:58:32,494 --> 01:58:52,399
[SPEAKER_07]: JVMod in our chatroom is talking about some of the Black Friday sales he got I got the $200 Playstation 3 bundle the $179.99 3DS bundle the $199.99 42 inch TV and a 3004 laptop I don't know what a 3004 laptop is I think he mistyped something the rest of that sounds like you dude can I have a loan?

1512
01:58:53,539 --> 01:58:55,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably $300 for a laptop.

1513
01:58:55,081 --> 01:58:55,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1514
01:58:55,421 --> 01:58:56,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's what it is.

1515
01:58:56,783 --> 01:58:57,244
[SPEAKER_07]: $300 for a laptop.

1516
01:58:57,284 --> 01:58:57,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, $300.

1517
01:58:57,664 --> 01:58:58,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe shift F4.

1518
01:58:59,527 --> 01:59:01,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's nice, though.

1519
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:05,394
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like your whole electronics for several years taken care of in one day.

1520
01:59:05,474 --> 01:59:05,975
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty nice.

1521
01:59:07,036 --> 01:59:11,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And Technus says, Oh, and after working a Black Friday myself, I cannot support it.

1522
01:59:12,783 --> 01:59:17,284
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I gotta say, props to you folks in retail, especially those of you on the front lines.

1523
01:59:17,305 --> 01:59:24,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, people pepper spraying in Walmart and shit is madness, but can you imagine having to work that Walmart that night?

1524
01:59:24,427 --> 01:59:25,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.

1525
01:59:28,208 --> 01:59:28,948
[SPEAKER_07]: You poor people.

1526
01:59:29,728 --> 01:59:32,609
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a very big reason why I never want to do retail again.

1527
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:35,690
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all summed up in one day right there.

1528
01:59:36,350 --> 01:59:37,931
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on with some gaming news, Loki.

1529
01:59:40,376 --> 01:59:42,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just because you've done, what, ten of them in a row?

1530
01:59:43,698 --> 01:59:44,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan called us all blisses.

1531
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:47,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, yeah.

1532
01:59:47,821 --> 01:59:54,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a funny story, actually, about this story that I'm going to talk about.

1533
01:59:54,085 --> 01:59:54,946
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, let's talk about this.

1534
01:59:55,706 --> 01:59:56,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer Vita.

1535
01:59:57,468 --> 01:59:59,449
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about why people pirate stuff.

1536
02:00:00,089 --> 02:00:01,010
[SPEAKER_08]: This is pretty bad.

1537
02:00:01,671 --> 02:00:05,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer Vita, it only includes three courses and five cars.

1538
02:00:06,994 --> 02:00:08,235
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds almost like a demo to me.

1539
02:00:09,816 --> 02:00:19,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, according to the Japanese press sampling of Ridge Racer, they're surprised to find that the game only has a few tracks and a few cars.

1540
02:00:19,703 --> 02:00:26,848
[SPEAKER_08]: They said, of course, there will be download content, but it's just weird that there's so little material.

1541
02:00:27,348 --> 02:00:35,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, apparently, I guess there's also supposed to be this Planetary League as well, which is a new mode that sounds kind of neat.

1542
02:00:36,054 --> 02:00:37,175
[SPEAKER_08]: and Planetary League.

1543
02:00:37,656 --> 02:00:41,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess Namco is going to be sending out team battle missions for multiplayer.

1544
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:49,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus it's also playable over Wi-Fi and ad hoc and all sorts of stuff and you can share ghost data.

1545
02:00:49,706 --> 02:00:54,230
[SPEAKER_08]: But three tracks and five cars?

1546
02:00:54,830 --> 02:00:55,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1547
02:00:55,631 --> 02:00:59,194
[SPEAKER_07]: And on top of that... Because you know it's going to be DLC.

1548
02:00:59,495 --> 02:01:03,378
[SPEAKER_08]: And on top of that, the game is supposed to be slightly cheaper than...

1549
02:01:04,781 --> 02:01:05,681
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, most of the video games.

1550
02:01:06,001 --> 02:01:06,981
[SPEAKER_07]: 40 bucks instead of 50.

1551
02:01:07,642 --> 02:01:08,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1552
02:01:08,682 --> 02:01:09,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1553
02:01:09,202 --> 02:01:10,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Boo hiss.

1554
02:01:10,362 --> 02:01:14,803
[SPEAKER_07]: If this is true, if this is true, then fuck this game for real.

1555
02:01:15,003 --> 02:01:18,804
[SPEAKER_08]: And it only runs at 30 frames per second instead of 60 frames per second.

1556
02:01:19,264 --> 02:01:22,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's, I had a dream last night about this.

1557
02:01:22,665 --> 02:01:28,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I seriously, for some reason, and I don't even know why because I read this earlier in the week, some reason I just had a dream about this.

1558
02:01:29,386 --> 02:01:33,187
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember I was talking to some guy

1559
02:01:33,587 --> 02:01:49,478
[SPEAKER_08]: who apparently in the dream was representative of the person responsible for this game and my response was this what the fuck were you thinking I mean really seriously three fucking tracks and five cars no one's gonna fucking buy this game

1560
02:01:49,838 --> 02:01:50,439
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ridge Racer

1561
02:02:04,815 --> 02:02:05,775
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all you get for this.

1562
02:02:05,795 --> 02:02:07,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, three fucking tracks.

1563
02:02:07,676 --> 02:02:08,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

1564
02:02:08,377 --> 02:02:11,138
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one thing to just openly reject this game if it does come out $40.

1565
02:02:11,418 --> 02:02:18,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope this is just like maybe an early build, like a press build or something, like a demo.

1566
02:02:18,401 --> 02:02:25,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe just they're really working to get the full game done and it's just not ready, you know, and it's not going to be ready until it goes gold.

1567
02:02:26,445 --> 02:02:28,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really hoping that's what happens.

1568
02:02:29,026 --> 02:02:33,048
[SPEAKER_07]: And soon we'll get this Japanese website that's like, comes with 20 tracks and 20...

1569
02:02:33,588 --> 02:02:36,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I hope so, because Ridge Racer is pretty awesome.

1570
02:02:37,049 --> 02:02:41,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I think for the launch, the 3DS, it was one of the best games that they had available.

1571
02:02:41,771 --> 02:02:42,431
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, yeah.

1572
02:02:42,491 --> 02:02:44,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though there was all rehash stuff.

1573
02:02:44,812 --> 02:02:48,093
[SPEAKER_08]: But the 3D effects, it was a good 3D show-off game, yeah.

1574
02:02:48,633 --> 02:02:49,994
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, seriously.

1575
02:02:50,014 --> 02:02:52,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Dungeon Buster in our chat room.

1576
02:02:52,775 --> 02:02:54,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Ridge Ripoff!

1577
02:02:55,956 --> 02:02:56,656
[SPEAKER_08]: It is just...

1578
02:02:57,791 --> 02:03:24,362
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's funny though because I actually I watched I was reading you know this and then I watched like the trailer I'm like hey you know what that trailer only shows these three tracks I wonder but it's gonna be one thing if the game comes out like this but it's gonna be just flat-out insulting if they add like a bunch of tracks as download content unless it's all free it's free DLC they won't but why would they do that they won't no

1579
02:03:27,023 --> 02:03:28,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, here's where I would support it.

1580
02:03:29,344 --> 02:03:32,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember on the PSP, they had Rock Band.

1581
02:03:32,505 --> 02:03:33,485
[SPEAKER_08]: You could buy Rock Band in the game.

1582
02:03:33,825 --> 02:03:39,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they also had Rock Band where you could download the free demo and then you pay for songs.

1583
02:03:39,666 --> 02:03:40,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, I remember that.

1584
02:03:40,387 --> 02:03:40,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

1585
02:03:41,207 --> 02:03:41,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fine with that.

1586
02:03:41,747 --> 02:03:48,489
[SPEAKER_08]: If they want to do this, like, say, put it on the store and, like, you know, okay, well, you can buy the game for nothing.

1587
02:03:48,649 --> 02:03:52,750
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes with three tracks and five cars, and you can buy the rest of the game for DLC.

1588
02:03:52,770 --> 02:03:52,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1589
02:03:53,670 --> 02:04:11,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fine with that or you know you pay 99 cents and you get the rest of this later on but as a retail game for like I'm assuming this is going to be 40 bucks I have yet to see the setup information for this I can't confirm on the price yet hopefully I'll know that soon but this is good it's probably gonna be about $40 game

1590
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:17,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Well Namco, one thing you need to do when you get back to work this week after the holiday is you need to clarify.

1591
02:04:17,974 --> 02:04:25,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Well I guess maybe in Japan they didn't really have the same holiday but still come next week at work they need to clarify what the hell is going on here?

1592
02:04:26,021 --> 02:04:27,522
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this game actually going to have in it?

1593
02:04:28,443 --> 02:04:30,324
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully next week we can correct that.

1594
02:04:31,932 --> 02:04:32,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's move on.

1595
02:04:35,015 --> 02:04:43,422
[SPEAKER_07]: A story has hit ComputerAndVideoGames.com about two possible, as they're calling it, Xbox 720 models that are planned.

1596
02:04:43,462 --> 02:04:49,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, there's going to be a dual SKU strategy expected, along with a significant Kinect upgrade.

1597
02:04:49,567 --> 02:04:53,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Long story short, you may or may not remember this.

1598
02:04:53,310 --> 02:04:56,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the Xbox 360 had two ways you could buy it.

1599
02:04:56,853 --> 02:05:00,156
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the, what, the regular, or what was it called, the

1600
02:05:00,336 --> 02:05:01,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Core and the Premium

1601
02:05:22,757 --> 02:05:28,239
[SPEAKER_07]: and it came with, thank you, a wireless controller instead of a wired one.

1602
02:05:28,859 --> 02:05:29,900
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the other big difference.

1603
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:33,681
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a shiny silver door as opposed to a plain white one.

1604
02:05:34,141 --> 02:05:35,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoop-de-doo, right?

1605
02:05:35,802 --> 02:05:42,725
[SPEAKER_07]: So apparently that's the road they're going down for whatever this next Xbox is, is that one will be a...

1606
02:05:43,405 --> 02:06:10,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Pairdown system to be released as cheaply as possible positioned more along the lines of a set-top box because 360 as a Netflix viewing device is apparently a huge deal and perhaps a Kinect-themed gaming portal but then there will be a more fully-featured machine with an optical drive hard disk and backward compatibility aimed at the hardcore would be released at a higher price point listen to that again

1607
02:06:11,823 --> 02:06:19,346
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a... Maybe, if rumors are to be believed, and there's going to be rumors or anything at this point, but maybe there's going to be an Xbox with no drive.

1608
02:06:19,906 --> 02:06:22,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I don't buy that there's not going to be drive in there.

1609
02:06:22,767 --> 02:06:24,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Optical drives are so fucking cheap.

1610
02:06:24,568 --> 02:06:27,489
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just... Why would you do that?

1611
02:06:27,749 --> 02:06:33,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because basically you're forcing people to buy the product online.

1612
02:06:33,691 --> 02:06:35,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's really the way they want to go with it, and fine.

1613
02:06:36,252 --> 02:06:37,973
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, no optical drive?

1614
02:06:37,993 --> 02:06:38,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

1615
02:06:38,593 --> 02:06:39,974
[SPEAKER_08]: DVD drives?

1616
02:06:40,414 --> 02:06:42,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's assume that it's going to be a Blu-ray drive.

1617
02:06:42,695 --> 02:06:46,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Blu-ray drives are not incredibly expensive anymore.

1618
02:06:46,257 --> 02:06:49,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they're not as cheap as DVD drives, that's for sure.

1619
02:06:50,459 --> 02:06:52,760
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get a Blu-ray player now for, what, $80, $100?

1620
02:06:53,681 --> 02:06:55,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't imagine that those drives are that expensive.

1621
02:06:55,422 --> 02:06:57,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Those things used to be $400 or $500.

1622
02:06:57,363 --> 02:07:00,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, same thing could be said about DVD players.

1623
02:07:00,464 --> 02:07:03,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember a time when a DVD player was like, that's the thing the rich kids had.

1624
02:07:05,737 --> 02:07:08,298
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, hey, whatever.

1625
02:07:08,619 --> 02:07:09,019
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

1626
02:07:09,079 --> 02:07:09,939
[SPEAKER_08]: They're giving you options.

1627
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:15,923
[SPEAKER_08]: So you don't have to buy the cheap, cheap, cheap one if you really want to.

1628
02:07:16,463 --> 02:07:19,545
[SPEAKER_07]: So obviously a lot of this is still to be unveiled.

1629
02:07:19,625 --> 02:07:25,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Another rumor is that Kinect will likely get a significant upgrade and be bundled with the console.

1630
02:07:26,589 --> 02:07:27,389
[SPEAKER_07]: That all makes sense.

1631
02:07:27,409 --> 02:07:31,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think Kinect is something Microsoft's kind of embedded in their...

1632
02:07:33,854 --> 02:07:35,275
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll get better.

1633
02:07:35,295 --> 02:07:35,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be interesting.

1634
02:07:36,016 --> 02:07:37,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the technology will get better, that's for sure.

1635
02:07:57,213 --> 02:07:58,454
[SPEAKER_07]: But then here's the other thing.

1636
02:07:58,474 --> 02:08:00,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I tell you the thing that bothers me most about this story?

1637
02:08:01,715 --> 02:08:05,657
[SPEAKER_07]: As that it's called two Xbox 720 models reportedly planned.

1638
02:08:05,717 --> 02:08:06,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, seriously?

1639
02:08:07,658 --> 02:08:11,860
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to stop calling it the Xbox 720 because that is a stupid name.

1640
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:13,641
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be called the Xbox 720.

1641
02:08:14,181 --> 02:08:15,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you call it that?

1642
02:08:17,185 --> 02:08:20,807
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox 360 did not come after the Xbox 359, okay?

1643
02:08:21,488 --> 02:08:25,370
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not, you know, and I get it, 360 times 2 is 720, but you know what?

1644
02:08:26,150 --> 02:08:29,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Something tells me they're going to just go another direction with the name.

1645
02:08:30,832 --> 02:08:33,013
[SPEAKER_07]: As to what direction they're going to go with the name?

1646
02:08:34,354 --> 02:08:41,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we thought we would bring back one of our old friends to help us figure that out, what exactly that name could be.

1647
02:08:42,478 --> 02:08:46,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is a segment on the show we like to call ListList!

1648
02:08:50,322 --> 02:08:57,287
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, tonight's listless topic is what should we refer to the new Xbox as?

1649
02:08:57,767 --> 02:08:59,468
[SPEAKER_07]: What should the new Xbox be called?

1650
02:08:59,568 --> 02:09:01,830
[SPEAKER_07]: What should we refer to it as here on the program?

1651
02:09:01,970 --> 02:09:04,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we're not calling it the Xbox 720 anymore.

1652
02:09:04,612 --> 02:09:07,474
[SPEAKER_07]: So what should the new name for the Xbox be?

1653
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:12,154
[SPEAKER_07]: 2, or whatever it's going to be, or I guess it would really be Xbox 3, what should it be called?

1654
02:09:13,255 --> 02:09:20,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you want to give us suggestions, you can in our chatroom at chat.orange.com, but this is a highly scientific process, people.

1655
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:24,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the way the list works if you've never listened to Listless before on the show.

1656
02:09:25,004 --> 02:09:27,126
[SPEAKER_07]: We're each going to go around and give our top three answers.

1657
02:09:27,166 --> 02:09:29,607
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll come up with a list of nine, since we have no guests tonight.

1658
02:09:29,667 --> 02:09:31,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually it's a list of 12, not tonight.

1659
02:09:31,788 --> 02:09:34,970
[SPEAKER_07]: But then we're each going to go around and take one off the list.

1660
02:09:35,051 --> 02:09:35,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's the hard part.

1661
02:09:36,271 --> 02:09:42,575
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll leave a list of six, which you guys will go around and vote on your number one and number two answers for.

1662
02:09:42,595 --> 02:09:47,919
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to get a definitive answer for what should the new Xbox be called.

1663
02:09:48,959 --> 02:09:49,239
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1664
02:09:50,901 --> 02:09:54,164
[SPEAKER_07]: So chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to give our suggestions.

1665
02:09:54,184 --> 02:09:54,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

1666
02:09:54,565 --> 02:09:54,865
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot that.

1667
02:09:54,905 --> 02:09:55,726
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't work tonight.

1668
02:09:57,027 --> 02:10:00,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Channel Orange Lounge on IRC Game Search if you want to give your suggestions.

1669
02:10:00,951 --> 02:10:02,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start building the list.

1670
02:10:03,134 --> 02:10:04,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will start with Loki tonight.

1671
02:10:06,604 --> 02:10:09,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Your number three answer, what should they call the new Xbox?

1672
02:10:09,586 --> 02:10:11,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Or what should we refer to it as here on the show?

1673
02:10:11,448 --> 02:10:19,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the way they have been changing their naming schemes for things, like especially Windows operating systems and stuff, before it used to be Windows 95, Vista, and they'd have funky names.

1674
02:10:20,135 --> 02:10:22,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's Windows 7, and they're talking about Windows 8.

1675
02:10:23,397 --> 02:10:25,899
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just going to say Microsoft Xbox 3.

1676
02:10:25,939 --> 02:10:27,601
[SPEAKER_08]: When I close my eyes...

1677
02:10:29,122 --> 02:10:34,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's simplified, I know it makes no sense, 363, but whatever.

1678
02:10:34,207 --> 02:10:36,309
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're just going to call it the Xbox 3?

1679
02:10:36,469 --> 02:10:36,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 3.

1680
02:10:37,109 --> 02:10:37,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1681
02:10:37,450 --> 02:10:38,451
[SPEAKER_07]: It works for PlayStation.

1682
02:10:39,011 --> 02:10:39,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1683
02:10:40,192 --> 02:10:40,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1684
02:10:41,253 --> 02:10:47,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to DarkSakura, your number 3 answer for what should the new Xbox be referred to as here on the program.

1685
02:10:47,239 --> 02:10:47,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 420.

1686
02:10:47,739 --> 02:10:47,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 420.

1687
02:10:50,181 --> 02:10:54,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder what this system does.

1688
02:10:55,666 --> 02:10:58,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man, suddenly I want to eat some Cheetos.

1689
02:10:58,928 --> 02:11:03,792
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to play?

1690
02:11:04,473 --> 02:11:07,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is Cheech and Chong suddenly the spokespeople for this system?

1691
02:11:07,315 --> 02:11:09,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I guess now it's Harold and Kumar, I guess.

1692
02:11:10,734 --> 02:11:12,316
[SPEAKER_04]: The new Muppets movie was so fucking awesome.

1693
02:11:29,355 --> 02:11:30,056
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1694
02:11:44,651 --> 02:11:47,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying, the new Muppets movie is really fucking good.

1695
02:11:47,692 --> 02:11:51,313
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit hokey because it's a kid's movie, but it's great.

1696
02:11:51,333 --> 02:11:53,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when someone buys my ticket, I'll go see it.

1697
02:11:53,773 --> 02:11:54,413
[SPEAKER_08]: What cameo?

1698
02:11:55,854 --> 02:11:56,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Line for what?

1699
02:11:56,594 --> 02:11:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, he's now the announcer for California Screamin'.

1700
02:12:00,095 --> 02:12:04,956
[SPEAKER_04]: So he does the safety announcement kind of like a fair barker.

1701
02:12:05,636 --> 02:12:08,720
[SPEAKER_04]: and then when you're in... Sorry, Rob.

1702
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:12,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, it's a name suggested in chat.

1703
02:12:12,384 --> 02:12:16,188
[SPEAKER_07]: You in the chat can't influence the list because I just saw a name in there I am fucking taking for the list.

1704
02:12:17,171 --> 02:12:23,294
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're actually in the thing ready to go, it says, Second thoughts?

1705
02:12:23,554 --> 02:12:24,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Too late!

1706
02:12:24,875 --> 02:12:26,676
[SPEAKER_04]: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, boom!

1707
02:12:27,997 --> 02:12:28,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1708
02:12:28,777 --> 02:12:29,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes it all the way better.

1709
02:12:30,198 --> 02:12:30,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, back to the list.

1710
02:12:31,739 --> 02:12:33,980
[SPEAKER_07]: So far we have Microsoft Xbox 3 and Xbox 420.

1711
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:37,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I have to explain this name a little bit.

1712
02:12:37,762 --> 02:12:40,724
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is the DexBox.

1713
02:12:41,738 --> 02:12:42,659
[SPEAKER_07]: The Dex Box.

1714
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:46,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Dex is short for what in Dungeons & Dragons speak?

1715
02:12:47,103 --> 02:12:47,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Dexterity.

1716
02:12:48,364 --> 02:12:51,147
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something that thieves have a high amount of.

1717
02:12:51,967 --> 02:12:53,308
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's the Dex Box.

1718
02:12:54,970 --> 02:12:56,331
[SPEAKER_07]: And so be it, Microsoft.

1719
02:12:56,371 --> 02:12:57,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Dex Box steal from you.

1720
02:12:59,314 --> 02:12:59,654
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1721
02:12:59,714 --> 02:13:00,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I always played Rangers.

1722
02:13:02,217 --> 02:13:05,620
[SPEAKER_07]: The Microsoft Dex Box is my answer.

1723
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:07,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to Loki for your number two answer.

1724
02:13:09,587 --> 02:13:11,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to think of really stupid Microsoft names.

1725
02:13:15,854 --> 02:13:16,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1726
02:13:17,335 --> 02:13:19,777
[SPEAKER_08]: The Microsoft Windows 8 Entertainment System.

1727
02:13:20,658 --> 02:13:23,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's very generic and stupid, but you know what?

1728
02:13:23,161 --> 02:13:25,523
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that sounds like it could be a Microsoft product.

1729
02:13:26,444 --> 02:13:28,346
[SPEAKER_07]: The Windows 8 Entertainment System.

1730
02:13:28,366 --> 02:13:29,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'd call it the latest?

1731
02:13:32,870 --> 02:13:33,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Waiters!

1732
02:13:35,754 --> 02:13:37,856
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a fly in my soup, waiters!

1733
02:13:40,159 --> 02:13:44,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Only if Harvey Fierstein can be the spokesperson for the waiters.

1734
02:13:45,065 --> 02:13:47,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to call my mother and tell her to get a waiters.

1735
02:13:51,661 --> 02:13:54,482
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have been a doctor, but instead you're a waiters.

1736
02:13:56,423 --> 02:13:57,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why.

1737
02:13:58,124 --> 02:14:02,706
[SPEAKER_07]: When I hear the name waiters, I think about Hire Me Fierce Team, but it just works, doesn't it?

1738
02:14:04,767 --> 02:14:06,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have retired in a bloke.

1739
02:14:06,668 --> 02:14:09,269
[SPEAKER_06]: The waiters, it has high definition connect.

1740
02:14:13,411 --> 02:14:14,032
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

1741
02:14:16,493 --> 02:14:18,374
[SPEAKER_06]: It can see how big your wiener is.

1742
02:14:20,355 --> 02:14:21,135
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the weightest.

1743
02:14:22,136 --> 02:14:23,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll tell you, eight isn't enough.

1744
02:14:25,578 --> 02:14:25,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1745
02:14:26,518 --> 02:14:27,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

1746
02:14:28,780 --> 02:14:31,741
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?

1747
02:14:32,201 --> 02:14:32,782
[SPEAKER_07]: ZuneBox.

1748
02:14:33,302 --> 02:14:34,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost said your number eight pick.

1749
02:14:35,043 --> 02:14:36,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Your number two pick, ZuneBox.

1750
02:14:36,824 --> 02:14:37,344
[SPEAKER_07]: ZuneBox.

1751
02:14:37,664 --> 02:14:38,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, ZuneBox.

1752
02:14:39,085 --> 02:14:44,809
[SPEAKER_04]: X, U, N, E, V, O, X You want to spell it with an X instead of a Z?

1753
02:14:45,890 --> 02:14:47,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1754
02:14:48,471 --> 02:14:49,312
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I like it.

1755
02:14:49,412 --> 02:14:50,593
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Shusha.

1756
02:14:51,613 --> 02:14:53,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can spell it with a Z, that's fine.

1757
02:14:53,355 --> 02:14:55,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, spell it with a Z, because that's what the thing is.

1758
02:14:55,676 --> 02:14:57,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I was just in the X thing.

1759
02:14:57,658 --> 02:15:01,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Zunebox, even though I think Microsoft retired the Zune some time ago.

1760
02:15:01,420 --> 02:15:03,101
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the whole Zune thing.

1761
02:15:03,201 --> 02:15:05,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Zunebox, I can see that.

1762
02:15:05,883 --> 02:15:08,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the Zune could be saved.

1763
02:15:09,266 --> 02:15:14,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's cooler to have it Zoom bar Oh sorry, no dash Yeah that's how I would brand it If they would hire me

1764
02:15:16,383 --> 02:15:17,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it, Microsoft.

1765
02:15:17,823 --> 02:15:21,844
[SPEAKER_04]: You should hire me to be your designer because I'm amazing and I make all your stuff look like Apple stuff.

1766
02:15:25,044 --> 02:15:25,405
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1767
02:15:26,445 --> 02:15:27,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

1768
02:15:27,145 --> 02:15:28,365
[SPEAKER_07]: My number two answer.

1769
02:15:29,585 --> 02:15:30,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to just put this.

1770
02:15:30,505 --> 02:15:33,986
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the rumored name and I do like this as a name for the system.

1771
02:15:34,186 --> 02:15:39,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And just in case this really is the name, I would like to be able to say we were right and we called it on the list.

1772
02:15:39,447 --> 02:15:44,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to put Xbox Loop on the list because Loop is the rumored name or at least the working title.

1773
02:15:45,868 --> 02:15:47,309
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a stupid name.

1774
02:15:48,130 --> 02:15:49,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it makes sense, though.

1775
02:15:49,931 --> 02:15:50,771
[SPEAKER_07]: 360 and then Loop.

1776
02:15:50,872 --> 02:15:51,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1777
02:15:51,532 --> 02:15:52,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox Loop.

1778
02:15:53,093 --> 02:15:55,635
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me think back to the books I was reading.

1779
02:15:55,715 --> 02:15:58,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Spiral, Loop, and then... Alright.

1780
02:15:58,917 --> 02:16:07,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means that some crazy-ass dead girl is going to climb out of my Xbox Loop when I don't change a disc for seven days.

1781
02:16:07,923 --> 02:16:11,666
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how they'll market it, is that, you know, in seven days, this machine will kill you.

1782
02:16:12,099 --> 02:16:12,419
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1783
02:16:13,540 --> 02:16:15,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one answer time.

1784
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:17,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, number one for the list.

1785
02:16:18,782 --> 02:16:19,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1786
02:16:22,703 --> 02:16:24,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to do... Let's see.

1787
02:16:24,884 --> 02:16:29,086
[SPEAKER_08]: The Microsoft... The Microsoft teabag rage quit...

1788
02:16:31,227 --> 02:16:42,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Racial Slur The Microsoft Teabag Rage Quit Racial Slur, wherever did that name come from?

1789
02:16:43,822 --> 02:16:44,864
[SPEAKER_07]: They named it after the players.

1790
02:16:48,226 --> 02:16:53,568
[SPEAKER_04]: We took your feedback and we've incorporated it into the name of our new machine.

1791
02:16:54,108 --> 02:17:00,570
[SPEAKER_08]: We have an algorithm running that monitors all sorts of voice communication over the system.

1792
02:17:01,030 --> 02:17:06,912
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's generated the perfect name for our system based off of the language that is used the most.

1793
02:17:08,512 --> 02:17:10,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Microsoft T-Bag Racial Slur.

1794
02:17:12,313 --> 02:17:13,875
[SPEAKER_07]: or the MTRs.

1795
02:17:15,977 --> 02:17:16,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1796
02:17:17,959 --> 02:17:20,481
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your number one answer.

1797
02:17:20,582 --> 02:17:21,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It's completely stupid.

1798
02:17:21,743 --> 02:17:22,624
[SPEAKER_04]: It's X-Rombus.

1799
02:17:23,845 --> 02:17:27,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I would really like to see them make something in the shape of a rhomboid.

1800
02:17:28,670 --> 02:17:28,970
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1801
02:17:29,010 --> 02:17:30,051
[SPEAKER_04]: All diagonal and shit.

1802
02:17:31,292 --> 02:17:50,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to say for my number one answer, okay, originally I was going to do the Xbox Penetrator, which I still like as a name, but I got to say I was won over by something that was suggested in chat because somebody brought up an old ass OLR joke that's seriously like seven years old at this point.

1803
02:17:50,648 --> 02:17:53,651
[SPEAKER_07]: So I give props to, I think it was SSJ100 Matt that said it.

1804
02:17:54,051 --> 02:17:55,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was SSJ100Matt that said it.

1805
02:17:55,614 --> 02:17:58,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna go with his answer for my number one.

1806
02:17:58,499 --> 02:18:01,926
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox non-Cylon-occupied Caprica.

1807
02:18:08,632 --> 02:18:11,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this robot's for the good guys, we promise.

1808
02:18:11,893 --> 02:18:14,994
[SPEAKER_07]: As these devices in our living room become more self-aware.

1809
02:18:15,054 --> 02:18:17,815
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox non-Cylon-occupied Caprica.

1810
02:18:18,355 --> 02:18:18,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1811
02:18:20,036 --> 02:18:21,296
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a really shitty list.

1812
02:18:22,016 --> 02:18:22,776
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

1813
02:18:23,056 --> 02:18:24,037
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of our worst.

1814
02:18:24,457 --> 02:18:26,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, at least we got Harvey Fierstein.

1815
02:18:26,117 --> 02:18:30,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we have the Microsoft Xbox 3, the Xbox 420, the DexBox...

1816
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:51,027
[SPEAKER_07]: The Waiters, the Windows 8 Entertainment System, the ZuneBox, the Xbox Loop, the Microsoft Teabag Rage Quit Racial Slur, the X-Rombus, and the Xbox Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.

1817
02:18:52,547 --> 02:19:00,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what I'm going to do, just because we don't have a fourth person with us tonight doing this with us, I'm going to go with one I'm seeing in chat a lot and just add it to the list.

1818
02:19:01,194 --> 02:19:05,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go with the Xbox Lube, which I'm seeing in the chat several times.

1819
02:19:05,478 --> 02:19:07,960
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's off a mispronunciation I made.

1820
02:19:07,980 --> 02:19:09,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's call Dan in to pick one, too.

1821
02:19:09,621 --> 02:19:17,108
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple weeks ago on the show, I think I said I was talking about the Lube, and I think I accidentally said the Xbox Lube or something like that.

1822
02:19:17,508 --> 02:19:19,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And so everybody's like, let's call it that.

1823
02:19:19,950 --> 02:19:20,430
[SPEAKER_07]: So fine.

1824
02:19:20,450 --> 02:19:20,851
[SPEAKER_07]: You're ready.

1825
02:19:27,316 --> 02:19:33,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Time to open up some room in your entertainment system.

1826
02:19:33,962 --> 02:19:35,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's voting for waiters.

1827
02:19:35,664 --> 02:19:35,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1828
02:19:37,485 --> 02:19:37,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget it.

1829
02:19:38,086 --> 02:19:38,906
[SPEAKER_07]: We gotta go to the next phase.

1830
02:19:38,926 --> 02:19:40,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we added one based on chats.

1831
02:19:40,588 --> 02:19:41,748
[SPEAKER_07]: We added Xbox Lube.

1832
02:19:42,009 --> 02:19:43,029
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we have a list of ten.

1833
02:19:43,310 --> 02:19:45,351
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna take this down to a list of seven.

1834
02:19:45,831 --> 02:19:49,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, it's time to start eliminating things from the list.

1835
02:19:50,555 --> 02:19:52,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, oh wait, let me read you the list so far.

1836
02:19:52,616 --> 02:19:54,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, I already did.

1837
02:19:54,698 --> 02:19:56,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm just excited.

1838
02:19:56,359 --> 02:19:57,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you need more soda?

1839
02:19:57,219 --> 02:19:58,801
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox Lube gets me excited.

1840
02:19:58,841 --> 02:20:00,202
[SPEAKER_07]: What's wrong, Rob?

1841
02:20:02,283 --> 02:20:02,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Waiters!

1842
02:20:03,504 --> 02:20:04,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I need more sugar!

1843
02:20:06,125 --> 02:20:07,186
[SPEAKER_05]: You're my sugar!

1844
02:20:08,767 --> 02:20:10,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1845
02:20:10,808 --> 02:20:11,569
[SPEAKER_07]: DexFox.

1846
02:20:13,150 --> 02:20:14,671
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't like my dexterity joke?

1847
02:20:15,551 --> 02:20:18,013
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stretching it.

1848
02:20:18,413 --> 02:20:18,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh!

1849
02:20:18,973 --> 02:20:19,894
[SPEAKER_08]: It's stretching it!

1850
02:20:22,976 --> 02:20:25,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet another catchphrase for the Xbox lube.

1851
02:20:28,914 --> 02:20:33,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Stretching the bounds of your imagination Can you take this all in?

1852
02:20:35,038 --> 02:20:48,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright We have to take it slow DarkSakura Just try to relax DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1853
02:20:48,493 --> 02:21:01,198
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nothing against you, Rob, but I'm taking off Xbox Loop because I think it's... I hope that's not the official name and I wouldn't want it to be associated with the official name.

1854
02:21:01,278 --> 02:21:03,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so the Xbox Loop comes off the list.

1855
02:21:03,719 --> 02:21:05,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang, you guys eliminated almost my whole list.

1856
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:07,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well I'm not taking my own answer off.

1857
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:08,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to leave at least one up there.

1858
02:21:09,762 --> 02:21:14,126
[SPEAKER_07]: So the one I'm going to take off, I'm going to take off Microsoft Xbox 3.

1859
02:21:14,507 --> 02:21:15,708
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just stupid.

1860
02:21:16,068 --> 02:21:17,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the PlayStation does that.

1861
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:18,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

1862
02:21:18,471 --> 02:21:22,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I am making the chatters be more creative tonight than pick that answer.

1863
02:21:23,617 --> 02:21:23,937
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1864
02:21:24,998 --> 02:21:25,599
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is.

1865
02:21:26,599 --> 02:21:29,001
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the official list that you can vote on.

1866
02:21:30,202 --> 02:21:31,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder what's going to win.

1867
02:21:31,643 --> 02:21:36,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Your number one and number two answers are welcome through private message to Sky in the chat room right now.

1868
02:21:36,386 --> 02:21:36,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

1869
02:21:37,386 --> 02:21:50,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 420, Windows 8 Entertainment System, Queda's ZuneBox, Microsoft Teabag Rage Quit Racial Slur, X-Rombus, Xbox Non-Sylon Occupied Caprica, and the Xbox Lube.

1870
02:21:50,735 --> 02:21:55,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Send a private message to Sky with your votes for number one and number two answers.

1871
02:21:55,916 --> 02:22:00,657
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't say which is one and which is two, then I assume your first one is one and your second one is two.

1872
02:22:02,018 --> 02:22:04,058
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, now everybody is coming up.

1873
02:22:04,198 --> 02:22:05,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's a comic now.

1874
02:22:05,458 --> 02:22:06,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in our chat room.

1875
02:22:06,739 --> 02:22:08,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox Lube, get ready to stretch.

1876
02:22:08,859 --> 02:22:11,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Hecht, Xbox Lube, we're stretching it.

1877
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:16,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Dungeon Buster gives new meaning to the term Red Ring of Death.

1878
02:22:22,058 --> 02:22:22,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we're so mature.

1879
02:22:23,339 --> 02:22:23,660
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1880
02:22:25,102 --> 02:22:28,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you guys decided on some highbrow entertainment for your day.

1881
02:22:29,647 --> 02:22:29,907
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1882
02:22:29,987 --> 02:22:31,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, there's no mailbag tonight.

1883
02:22:33,171 --> 02:22:34,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly.

1884
02:22:36,255 --> 02:22:38,798
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's always time for some FUs of the week.

1885
02:22:54,788 --> 02:23:08,489
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to Stuff and Things and the Stuff and Things are actually Stuff and Things that I'm not at liberty to openly discuss and then FU to I'm going to get political here

1886
02:23:09,662 --> 02:23:22,326
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to people who vote a straight party ticket and F you to people in high positions who think they can cheat and get away with it because they have cheated and gotten away with it.

1887
02:23:22,566 --> 02:23:24,106
[SPEAKER_04]: People wonder why everyone's so pissed.

1888
02:23:24,546 --> 02:23:24,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Done.

1889
02:23:27,011 --> 02:23:31,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you to the local news stations for counting down to Black Friday.

1890
02:23:32,636 --> 02:23:33,577
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so annoying.

1891
02:23:33,657 --> 02:23:35,578
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 11 o'clock and there are people lined up.

1892
02:23:35,838 --> 02:23:38,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, people line up every single year.

1893
02:23:38,320 --> 02:23:39,441
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not fucking news.

1894
02:23:40,642 --> 02:23:42,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be amazed that people are lined up for sales.

1895
02:23:43,285 --> 02:23:44,786
[SPEAKER_08]: They do it all the damn time.

1896
02:23:47,846 --> 02:24:10,801
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the fact that my vacation from work is almost over I mean I like my job and all but I really like sitting at home on my ass doing nothing and then F you to the fact that I'm like really getting hungry but I have a lovely dinner that Alan's been working on literally all day in the crock pot waiting for me when I get home so I have that to look forward to but in the meantime god damn I want a donut F you to donuts for being delicious

1897
02:24:11,061 --> 02:24:13,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you to Krispy Kreme not being in Northern California.

1898
02:24:14,042 --> 02:24:15,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I get Krispy Kreme in two months.

1899
02:24:15,703 --> 02:24:17,604
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to Krispy Kreme not being next door.

1900
02:24:18,064 --> 02:24:19,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I get Krispy Kreme in two months.

1901
02:24:19,405 --> 02:24:20,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you work that all out?

1902
02:24:20,905 --> 02:24:21,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1903
02:24:21,986 --> 02:24:23,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's still the goal time.

1904
02:24:23,786 --> 02:24:24,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

1905
02:24:25,007 --> 02:24:25,227
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1906
02:24:25,247 --> 02:24:27,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's go back to some gaming news.

1907
02:24:27,788 --> 02:24:29,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Skype line is coming up real soon.

1908
02:24:29,869 --> 02:24:31,210
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1909
02:24:31,230 --> 02:24:34,191
[SPEAKER_07]: But not yet because we still have a few more stories to get through starting with Loki.

1910
02:24:34,531 --> 02:24:42,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we were talking about new Xbox systems, and, well, this is something that is kind of branching out the Kinect a little bit.

1911
02:24:43,335 --> 02:24:44,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Kinect for Windows.

1912
02:24:44,955 --> 02:24:50,337
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be using a new Kinect camera, because before I was like, well, you've got to sit eight feet away from your damn computer to use this thing.

1913
02:24:50,737 --> 02:24:59,401
[SPEAKER_08]: But, no, they're actually going to include a firmware that's going to support a new near mode that's designed to see objects as close as 50 centimeters away from the camera.

1914
02:25:00,302 --> 02:25:15,700
[SPEAKER_08]: and I guess also they're launching with this in early 2012 a Kinect Accelerator program which will give $20,000 each to 10 startups using Kinect along with Microsoft development tools.

1915
02:25:16,861 --> 02:25:18,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Marketing Visibility, and Mentoring.

1916
02:25:18,883 --> 02:25:24,847
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll be interesting to see what they use Kinect for the PC.

1917
02:25:24,927 --> 02:25:31,411
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously maybe we'll see this integrated into laptops and stuff like that.

1918
02:25:31,852 --> 02:25:34,814
[SPEAKER_08]: So it might be interesting to see how this evolves.

1919
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:40,781
[SPEAKER_08]: One other thing I was going to mention, too, is kind of a story that we got left out.

1920
02:25:41,621 --> 02:25:51,243
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a rumor that Microsoft is in the early stages of licensing with Sony for a Kinect-enabled TV.

1921
02:25:51,424 --> 02:25:52,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, I had heard about that.

1922
02:25:53,124 --> 02:25:56,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, it's supposed to be, I would imagine, some sort of like...

1923
02:25:58,126 --> 02:26:00,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, maybe some sort of web-enabled TV.

1924
02:26:00,809 --> 02:26:07,396
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how they have the enhanced TVs now where you can browse content online, maybe different apps.

1925
02:26:07,857 --> 02:26:12,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's how you'll browse through movies, doing Netflix and that kind of stuff through a TV.

1926
02:26:14,024 --> 02:26:14,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Be interesting to see that.

1927
02:26:15,385 --> 02:26:16,266
[SPEAKER_08]: That actually happened.

1928
02:26:16,326 --> 02:26:22,750
[SPEAKER_08]: It would also be weird to see Sony partnering with Microsoft on something.

1929
02:26:22,950 --> 02:26:32,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think it's somewhat inevitable that the next Xbox whatever we're going to end up calling it which we'll find out here in a minute could have Blu-ray in it.

1930
02:26:33,016 --> 02:26:43,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think they'd go with a proprietary disc but maybe if it's really supposed to be the whole Netflix I would think Blu-ray because they're going to try to get in on that.

1931
02:26:43,323 --> 02:26:45,564
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to have to kind of partner with Sony for that anyway.

1932
02:26:46,044 --> 02:26:47,464
[SPEAKER_07]: So it could be interesting.

1933
02:26:49,205 --> 02:26:50,125
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be very interesting.

1934
02:26:50,205 --> 02:26:52,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, you give us Blu-ray and we'll give you Kinect.

1935
02:26:53,986 --> 02:26:55,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you interested in Kinect for Windows at all, Loki?

1936
02:26:57,107 --> 02:26:59,448
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because I work on my laptop mostly.

1937
02:26:59,608 --> 02:27:03,589
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, hell, I don't use Kinect anyways on my 360.

1938
02:27:04,589 --> 02:27:12,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see that super fuzzy-wuzzy feel-good commercial that Extifer had posted on his Facebook where he's like, I really like the music in this.

1939
02:27:14,293 --> 02:27:15,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen that before.

1940
02:27:15,394 --> 02:27:18,977
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically an Apple commercial, but with Kinect.

1941
02:27:19,278 --> 02:27:28,506
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen that before, and it's a neat concept that they're showing these classrooms enabled with all these big projection screens and doing stuff.

1942
02:27:28,566 --> 02:27:34,231
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like the Cisco commercials that they have where there's kids in the U.S.

1943
02:27:34,291 --> 02:27:38,095
[SPEAKER_08]: talking to kids in China through almost like a portal or whatever.

1944
02:27:38,935 --> 02:28:08,322
[SPEAKER_08]: um you know like a some sort of webcam projection setup or whatever that they got but I mean I don't know it's a neat idea that they'll eventually do this stuff but and definitely with Connect for Windows and people creating new applications for it I could see more of that stuff coming about but it's I don't know it's too ideal for me idealistic I guess would be the word

1945
02:28:11,917 --> 02:28:14,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm going to move on with another story here.

1946
02:28:14,619 --> 02:28:18,322
[SPEAKER_07]: This is also the very, very, very, very, very last call for Cagematch.

1947
02:28:19,363 --> 02:28:21,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Listless votes, because we're about done.

1948
02:28:23,386 --> 02:28:27,830
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an interesting petition going on out there, and this is not... Okay, there's like two things going on right now.

1949
02:28:27,870 --> 02:28:34,495
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a really funny thing going around Facebook, which is from like a parody site, which is about how Xbox is...

1950
02:28:35,676 --> 02:28:37,918
[SPEAKER_07]: and all this stuff.

1951
02:28:37,958 --> 02:28:39,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Skyrim is turning everybody gay and all this stuff.

1952
02:28:39,979 --> 02:28:42,201
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean Skyrim job?

1953
02:28:42,381 --> 02:28:43,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, something like that.

1954
02:28:43,562 --> 02:28:45,123
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a really funny parody article.

1955
02:28:45,163 --> 02:28:46,705
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on Christwire or something like that.

1956
02:28:46,785 --> 02:28:49,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like an onion site for religious sites.

1957
02:28:49,707 --> 02:28:52,889
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, what I really want to share is this is actually a serious thing.

1958
02:28:52,929 --> 02:28:54,510
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a White House petition.

1959
02:28:54,530 --> 02:28:58,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you know the WhiteHouse.gov website will let you do your own petition.

1960
02:28:58,673 --> 02:29:01,355
[SPEAKER_07]: And somebody actually started one on there urging...

1961
02:29:03,033 --> 02:29:08,361
[SPEAKER_07]: to ban the Elder Scrolls Skyrim for the safety of America's youths.

1962
02:29:09,615 --> 02:29:14,676
[SPEAKER_07]: There were five backers that signed the petition at the time this was posted around gaming blogs.

1963
02:29:15,056 --> 02:29:18,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, tons more people have signed it as a joke or whatever after that.

1964
02:29:19,157 --> 02:29:23,398
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's basically petitioning the Obama administration.

1965
02:29:23,438 --> 02:29:24,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me read this.

1966
02:29:24,158 --> 02:29:25,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote, No, it's not.

1967
02:29:34,881 --> 02:29:41,124
[SPEAKER_07]: where sexual perversion and homosexuality are threatening to destroy the Christian foundations on which this nation was built.

1968
02:29:43,445 --> 02:29:44,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear that?

1969
02:29:44,066 --> 02:29:46,587
[SPEAKER_07]: My relationship is threatening America.

1970
02:29:47,067 --> 02:29:47,607
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1971
02:29:47,627 --> 02:29:49,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you feel threatened by my relationship?

1972
02:29:49,888 --> 02:29:50,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Girl, no.

1973
02:29:51,729 --> 02:29:55,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you should be threatened because he knows how to cook.

1974
02:29:56,792 --> 02:29:57,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

1975
02:29:57,600 --> 02:29:59,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally not threatened because I want to come over for dinner.

1976
02:30:01,284 --> 02:30:07,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas a new video game has just been created that far exceeds any others in the psychological and spiritual damage it does to teens.

1977
02:30:08,792 --> 02:30:11,856
[SPEAKER_07]: We ask you to ban Skyrim, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

1978
02:30:13,898 --> 02:30:19,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this petition may have actually been created by that same parody website.

1979
02:30:20,768 --> 02:30:25,612
[SPEAKER_07]: But whatever, it's still interesting that you can post this out there and that it is on the official White House site.

1980
02:30:25,913 --> 02:30:29,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And I bet you people signed that not knowing that it was parody.

1981
02:30:29,576 --> 02:30:31,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet a lot of people signed it not knowing if it really was parody.

1982
02:30:32,358 --> 02:30:33,379
[SPEAKER_07]: But they didn't really know that.

1983
02:30:33,599 --> 02:30:34,420
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just sad.

1984
02:30:34,820 --> 02:30:35,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1985
02:30:35,701 --> 02:30:40,605
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to create a petition banning online petitions.

1986
02:30:40,665 --> 02:30:41,346
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

1987
02:30:42,887 --> 02:30:42,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

1988
02:30:43,008 --> 02:30:46,671
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to petition for something, you go stand outside of a Walmart and get signatures.

1989
02:30:48,089 --> 02:30:52,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be like, hey, well, you know they did that on an episode of Bullshit.

1990
02:30:52,744 --> 02:30:53,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they?

1991
02:30:53,526 --> 02:30:54,369
[SPEAKER_04]: About, um...

1992
02:30:56,389 --> 02:31:01,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Missguided patriotism and how people, if they hear certain keywords, will sign just about anything.

1993
02:31:03,475 --> 02:31:04,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Protect children.

1994
02:31:04,696 --> 02:31:13,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but they actually did show that it was actually the majority of people who I think wouldn't actually sign it because they stopped to think about it.

1995
02:31:14,324 --> 02:31:21,730
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, they also had a petition out at a Greenpeace rally to ban H2O.

1996
02:31:24,169 --> 02:31:25,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, I think I remember something like that.

1997
02:31:25,951 --> 02:31:26,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it was, like, banned.

1998
02:31:27,352 --> 02:31:30,535
[SPEAKER_07]: But, like, this chemical is in... And it was a chemical name, and it was, like, water.

1999
02:31:30,855 --> 02:31:31,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2000
02:31:31,135 --> 02:31:31,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2001
02:31:32,516 --> 02:31:33,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Or soda or something like that, yeah.

2002
02:31:33,637 --> 02:31:34,158
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was water.

2003
02:31:34,378 --> 02:31:34,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it?

2004
02:31:35,038 --> 02:31:38,221
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were like, it's a dangerous chemical, and blah, blah, blah, blah, and, you know.

2005
02:31:38,662 --> 02:31:39,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

2006
02:31:39,843 --> 02:31:40,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2007
02:31:41,144 --> 02:31:45,527
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, one more story from you, DarkSakura, and then it's almost time for the tweets at Twitter.

2008
02:31:45,547 --> 02:31:46,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, dihydrogenoxide.

2009
02:31:46,668 --> 02:31:48,089
[SPEAKER_04]: At twitter.com slash OLR.

2010
02:31:48,109 --> 02:31:49,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Dihydrogen dioxide.

2011
02:31:50,551 --> 02:31:50,772
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2012
02:31:50,872 --> 02:31:51,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2013
02:31:52,714 --> 02:31:53,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being dumb.

2014
02:31:53,474 --> 02:31:53,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2015
02:31:54,495 --> 02:31:55,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have another article.

2016
02:31:56,776 --> 02:31:57,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Google Chrome.

2017
02:31:58,076 --> 02:31:59,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, Google Chrome.

2018
02:32:00,077 --> 02:32:07,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's actually going to be adding in more hardware support to the browser, including using a gamepad.

2019
02:32:07,820 --> 02:32:15,323
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only will you be able to play your games, you can play your games with your actual gamepad.

2020
02:32:16,163 --> 02:32:19,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means it's going to be a lot more of these...

2021
02:32:21,466 --> 02:32:24,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Web-only games should actually start being easier to play.

2022
02:32:24,569 --> 02:32:28,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we might see a bit more development for new true console-style games.

2023
02:32:28,392 --> 02:32:32,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've already got a lot of NES games emulated in Flash.

2024
02:32:32,976 --> 02:32:33,537
[SPEAKER_04]: We might see more.

2025
02:32:37,435 --> 02:32:43,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the idea of gamepads in browsers, but that's just going to lead to even more of the emulation websites.

2026
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:44,300
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little bit more.

2027
02:32:45,121 --> 02:32:56,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Google's actually going to put in support for WebRTC, which is a video chat thing, but Firefox already has gamepad support for the record.

2028
02:32:56,656 --> 02:33:07,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I actually say that I do really like, though, that, you know, we had a story last week or the week before or whenever we had a show about how, like, you can get demos for games through YouTube now.

2029
02:33:07,522 --> 02:33:08,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, there was that FIFA game.

2030
02:33:08,943 --> 02:33:16,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, so it would make a lot of sense that gamepads will be enabled within the browser because, like, a lot of stuff seems like it's going to be streaming, like, right through your browser.

2031
02:33:17,127 --> 02:33:24,531
[SPEAKER_07]: And shit, people play the Facebook games and probably a Google Plus game is looking at using this if Google Chrome is launching it.

2032
02:33:24,611 --> 02:33:24,791
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

2033
02:33:26,472 --> 02:33:27,052
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting.

2034
02:33:27,653 --> 02:33:30,094
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that kind of support, I can support.

2035
02:33:30,754 --> 02:33:30,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha!

2036
02:33:32,414 --> 02:33:34,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's see.

2037
02:33:34,675 --> 02:33:39,297
[SPEAKER_07]: We're about to get to the Twitter and last minute stories, but I think we should do some listless results.

2038
02:33:39,637 --> 02:33:42,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Shouldn't we find out what we're going to be calling the new Xbox officially?

2039
02:33:43,319 --> 02:33:43,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.

2040
02:33:43,979 --> 02:33:46,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you know, after tonight, it's no more Xbox 720.

2041
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:48,200
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be calling it by this name.

2042
02:33:48,361 --> 02:33:50,041
[SPEAKER_04]: The bend over and take it like a man.

2043
02:33:50,701 --> 02:33:51,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's find out.

2044
02:33:51,642 --> 02:33:54,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if... Let's see who got their way.

2045
02:33:57,694 --> 02:34:01,615
[SPEAKER_07]: In at number three is a tie.

2046
02:34:01,635 --> 02:34:01,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

2047
02:34:01,995 --> 02:34:13,818
[SPEAKER_07]: The number three answer for what we should call the new system, the Xbox 420, because, you know, we have a few stoners in our chat, and the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.

2048
02:34:13,918 --> 02:34:13,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2049
02:34:14,018 --> 02:34:16,539
[SPEAKER_07]: You're tied for your number three answer.

2050
02:34:17,359 --> 02:34:24,261
[SPEAKER_07]: The number two thing you most want to call the new Xbox is the Xbox non-Cylon-occupied Caprica.

2051
02:34:24,881 --> 02:34:25,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

2052
02:34:26,963 --> 02:34:28,945
[SPEAKER_07]: And the number one answer.

2053
02:34:29,505 --> 02:34:30,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I put it this way?

2054
02:34:30,346 --> 02:34:31,687
[SPEAKER_07]: It got twice as many votes.

2055
02:34:31,947 --> 02:34:32,988
[SPEAKER_07]: And no one's surprised.

2056
02:34:33,308 --> 02:34:40,695
[SPEAKER_07]: The number one answer, the Xbox Lube, is the official name of the new Xbox console.

2057
02:34:40,755 --> 02:34:42,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, chatterers.

2058
02:34:42,356 --> 02:34:45,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, Microsoft and the Xbox Lube.

2059
02:34:45,959 --> 02:34:47,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think you can handle it?

2060
02:34:48,747 --> 02:34:51,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it should be bend over and take it like a man.

2061
02:34:51,269 --> 02:34:55,371
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very narrowly missing the list, by the way.

2062
02:34:55,451 --> 02:34:57,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Waiters didn't make the top three.

2063
02:34:57,272 --> 02:34:57,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you notice that?

2064
02:34:58,472 --> 02:34:59,473
[SPEAKER_07]: That's poopy.

2065
02:34:59,913 --> 02:35:03,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Even after my Harvey Fierstein impersonation, waiters missed the list.

2066
02:35:03,275 --> 02:35:04,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that might have hurt it.

2067
02:35:04,275 --> 02:35:04,776
[SPEAKER_04]: That might have hurt.

2068
02:35:04,796 --> 02:35:05,136
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

2069
02:35:05,176 --> 02:35:06,217
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have hurt its chances.

2070
02:35:06,657 --> 02:35:08,118
[SPEAKER_04]: They were raised badly.

2071
02:35:09,178 --> 02:35:10,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Them others didn't do their job.

2072
02:35:12,322 --> 02:35:13,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so there it is.

2073
02:35:13,342 --> 02:35:20,544
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox Lube is the official new title of the Xbox console and here on the show, here in chat, and hopefully soon across the entirety of the internet.

2074
02:35:20,564 --> 02:35:21,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we call it the Xbloob?

2075
02:35:22,504 --> 02:35:26,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, we can call it the Xbloob and other fun creations there will be Xbox Lube.

2076
02:35:27,786 --> 02:35:30,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get to last minute stories.

2077
02:35:31,087 --> 02:35:35,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, again, we were in an interesting situation this week because we lost the usual way we prep the show.

2078
02:35:36,628 --> 02:35:37,868
[SPEAKER_07]: So does anybody have anything they want to add?

2079
02:35:37,888 --> 02:35:41,049
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, were there any stories that you wanted to get to that we didn't

2080
02:35:41,400 --> 02:35:42,280
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not really.

2081
02:35:42,560 --> 02:35:44,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, hold on, there was one.

2082
02:35:44,741 --> 02:35:45,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, do one.

2083
02:35:45,562 --> 02:35:46,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Loki, do one.

2084
02:35:46,382 --> 02:35:48,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully it's not the same story or you're screwed.

2085
02:35:48,923 --> 02:35:52,924
[SPEAKER_08]: South Korea has put into effect what they're calling the Cinderella Law.

2086
02:35:53,665 --> 02:36:06,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, they're working with their internet providers that they're going to block players from under 16 from playing between midnight and 6 a.m.

2087
02:36:07,350 --> 02:36:10,671
[SPEAKER_08]: on online services such as PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.

2088
02:36:12,828 --> 02:36:13,128
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2089
02:36:14,049 --> 02:36:14,910
[SPEAKER_08]: It is in Korea.

2090
02:36:15,711 --> 02:36:17,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, didn't they ban MMOs too?

2091
02:36:18,393 --> 02:36:18,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2092
02:36:18,613 --> 02:36:20,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that South or North that did that?

2093
02:36:20,154 --> 02:36:20,695
[SPEAKER_08]: South Korea.

2094
02:36:21,576 --> 02:36:22,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2095
02:36:23,217 --> 02:36:24,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I've got a couple.

2096
02:36:25,319 --> 02:36:28,782
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is that Microsoft bought a video surf to use on Xbox Live.

2097
02:36:29,914 --> 02:36:30,715
[SPEAKER_07]: What's VideoSurf do?

2098
02:36:30,815 --> 02:36:46,189
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a search engine, but it's saying that the overtime technology, it says it's supposed to be integrated with Xbox Live, and that you can use it to search for TV, film, across several Xbox Live applications.

2099
02:36:46,730 --> 02:36:49,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Love Film, Zune, etc.,

2100
02:36:50,833 --> 02:37:14,877
[SPEAKER_04]: the US will okay in the UK they're getting BBC content and the US will get Bravo, Comcast, HBO Go, Verizon, FIOS and Syfy we're gonna get Bravo yeah I know I was like I can't wait for the real housewives of you know Boulder Colorado or wherever they're gonna go next

2101
02:37:15,603 --> 02:37:36,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, um, I, you probably said something about this on, um, Horde House Yes, I did, but go ahead Yeah, about the, uh, talent calculator being live for Mists of Pandaria Or as I call it, MOP Which is notable because the game itself shouldn't be out for at least another six months, if not more like nine to twelve So it's interesting that the talent calculator's already out there

2102
02:37:36,559 --> 02:37:40,084
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see how talented you want to be at mopping.

2103
02:37:40,926 --> 02:37:41,406
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

2104
02:37:42,888 --> 02:37:43,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

2105
02:37:43,589 --> 02:37:45,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the calculator for monk is not available.

2106
02:37:46,133 --> 02:37:47,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, because they don't want to give everything away.

2107
02:37:48,336 --> 02:37:48,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2108
02:37:49,967 --> 02:37:51,068
[SPEAKER_08]: A few things.

2109
02:37:51,829 --> 02:38:03,261
[SPEAKER_08]: There was supposed to be a lawsuit against EA for reneging on the fact that Battlefield 1943 didn't come with Battlefield 3 or something like that.

2110
02:38:05,263 --> 02:38:08,426
[SPEAKER_08]: So now they're going to be giving away The other way around, by the way.

2111
02:38:08,966 --> 02:38:17,552
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be giving away Battlefield 1943 vouchers to everybody that bought the PlayStation 3 version of Battlefield 3.

2112
02:38:19,413 --> 02:38:23,396
[SPEAKER_08]: To redeem this, you have to go to their portal, which is 1943redemption.battlefield.com

2113
02:38:26,198 --> 02:38:26,639
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

2114
02:38:47,501 --> 02:38:49,703
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's good that they finally came through with that.

2115
02:38:49,743 --> 02:38:51,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, it took a lot to do that.

2116
02:38:51,766 --> 02:38:55,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if we reported on this before, but the same thing happened with Saints Row the 3rd.

2117
02:38:55,309 --> 02:38:59,634
[SPEAKER_08]: They were supposed to be getting exclusive content for Saints Row the 3rd, and THQ came now.

2118
02:39:00,494 --> 02:39:00,915
[SPEAKER_08]: If you...

2119
02:39:02,356 --> 02:39:23,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Sign up if you log in your online pass that comes with the new copies of Saints Row 3, or if you buy the game and buy the online pass, if you buy the game used and buy the online pass, as long as you redeem that pass, I forget what the time frame is, you get a free copy or a free download of Saints Row 2 on the PlayStation 3, which is pretty awesome.

2120
02:39:23,211 --> 02:39:23,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I heard about that.

2121
02:39:25,913 --> 02:39:27,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely worth checking that out.

2122
02:39:28,534 --> 02:39:33,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Cthulhu Saves the World Bundle has sold 100,000 copies on Steam.

2123
02:39:33,235 --> 02:39:36,455
[SPEAKER_07]: How many did they sell on Xbox Live Arcade or indie games?

2124
02:39:36,535 --> 02:39:39,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Indie games, they have only moved 55,000 to date.

2125
02:39:40,796 --> 02:39:42,877
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's been available since December 2010.

2126
02:39:42,917 --> 02:39:44,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, that's still more than I would have thought.

2127
02:39:48,742 --> 02:40:08,398
[SPEAKER_08]: and uh actually wait a second here I'm sorry uh Breath of Death that was Breath of Death 7 has been uh available since April 2010 on Xbox Live Indie Games and has moved 55,000 copies uh to date Cthulhu uh Saves the World has been available since December 2010 and has only generated uh 20,000 downloads yikes

2128
02:40:12,001 --> 02:40:19,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently, I don't know when it went up on Steam, but they sold 100,000 copies.

2129
02:40:20,669 --> 02:40:21,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, since July.

2130
02:40:22,430 --> 02:40:22,990
[SPEAKER_08]: July.

2131
02:40:23,951 --> 02:40:24,532
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

2132
02:40:25,312 --> 02:40:25,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Big difference there.

2133
02:40:26,233 --> 02:40:35,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, their next title that they're working on is actually was the once-canceled Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness, Episode 3.

2134
02:40:36,462 --> 02:40:37,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.

2135
02:40:37,863 --> 02:40:39,084
[SPEAKER_07]: So these guys picked it up.

2136
02:40:39,604 --> 02:40:39,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2137
02:40:39,845 --> 02:40:39,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

2138
02:40:41,186 --> 02:41:08,307
[SPEAKER_08]: um so it's interesting um also uh what's also interesting Elder Scrolls Skyrim has uh much of the uh I guess uh land of uh Tamriel from uh was it uh yeah there was a video of that up of the guy uh no clipping right yeah from Morrowind um and people are assuming that's just from uh cause the way they display the map or whatever that they just wanted to be complete um

2139
02:41:09,096 --> 02:41:10,276
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still neat either way.

2140
02:41:11,257 --> 02:41:20,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, Skyrim got a patch on PC, but what's kind of annoying is that they added mandatory Steam DRM.

2141
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:24,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've also killed some of the tweaks that you can do in the game.

2142
02:41:25,642 --> 02:41:26,882
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that kind of sucks.

2143
02:41:28,419 --> 02:41:36,045
[SPEAKER_08]: and then last but not least, new dashboard update for the Xbox 360 has been dated for December 6th.

2144
02:41:36,245 --> 02:41:37,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of big news we missed, huh?

2145
02:41:38,386 --> 02:41:50,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And that of course will be bringing cloud storage as well as the beacon support which is I believe live already on Xbox.com Isn't that kind of like the don't you want to play these games with me type of thing?

2146
02:41:50,515 --> 02:41:53,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like you go, hey, I'm playing Call of Duty later today.

2147
02:41:53,377 --> 02:41:54,378
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you can see that.

2148
02:41:54,398 --> 02:41:55,479
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of cool, I guess.

2149
02:41:55,719 --> 02:41:56,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Something.

2150
02:41:57,500 --> 02:41:58,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have that.

2151
02:41:58,401 --> 02:42:01,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, of course, the redesign to make it look like Windows Phone 7.

2152
02:42:02,584 --> 02:42:02,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Boo.

2153
02:42:03,605 --> 02:42:04,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's open up the Skype line.

[SPEAKER_07]: So definitely use Skype if you're somewhere else.

2164
02:42:28,346 --> 02:42:30,488
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't get a whole lot tonight, but just a couple.

2165
02:42:31,108 --> 02:42:35,132
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start here with a link from Tiger Claw on Twitter sent us.

2166
02:42:35,972 --> 02:42:37,353
[SPEAKER_07]: A reminder, I did read about this earlier.

2167
02:42:37,373 --> 02:42:44,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't make the show roll tonight, but he reminds us just in time for Christmas, the Batcave will be Arkham City's newest challenge map.

2168
02:42:44,898 --> 02:42:48,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is going to be some DLC that hits, and I think the date was December 20th.

2169
02:42:48,581 --> 02:42:51,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, December 20th is going to be a new DLC pack.

2170
02:42:51,043 --> 02:42:55,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, this is for Arkham City, and it's actually going to be a Batcave challenge map.

2171
02:42:56,106 --> 02:43:00,069
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also going to contain the Iceberg Lounge and Joker's Carnival.

2172
02:43:00,529 --> 02:43:02,651
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's going to be coming out December 20th.

2173
02:43:03,231 --> 02:43:06,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't the Robin pack hit this week?

2174
02:43:06,935 --> 02:43:07,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2175
02:43:07,695 --> 02:43:09,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to check that out.

2176
02:43:09,257 --> 02:43:14,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, yeah, I don't know much about what's supposed to be in that Robin pack, except, well, of course, Robin.

2177
02:43:14,562 --> 02:43:15,363
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play as Robin.

2178
02:43:16,304 --> 02:43:19,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if they integrate him into the story like they do Catwoman.

2179
02:43:19,567 --> 02:43:22,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he's supposed to be integrated into the story.

2180
02:43:22,209 --> 02:43:22,930
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of rad.

2181
02:43:22,970 --> 02:43:23,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have to check that out.

2182
02:43:24,572 --> 02:43:24,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2183
02:43:26,417 --> 02:43:31,982
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, again, the phone is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or as your name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2184
02:43:32,522 --> 02:43:35,384
[SPEAKER_07]: We are getting a call, so let's go to the phones.

2185
02:43:35,465 --> 02:43:36,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2186
02:43:36,806 --> 02:43:37,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2187
02:43:38,827 --> 02:43:39,668
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Jester Scott.

2188
02:43:40,068 --> 02:43:41,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Jester Scott, welcome to the show.

2189
02:43:44,032 --> 02:43:44,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

2190
02:43:44,412 --> 02:43:44,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

2191
02:43:44,852 --> 02:43:45,533
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2192
02:43:46,894 --> 02:43:48,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of things.

2193
02:43:49,656 --> 02:43:51,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that y'all were talking about the

2194
02:43:52,113 --> 02:43:53,856
[SPEAKER_01]: GameStop stickers one time.

2195
02:43:54,116 --> 02:43:56,520
[SPEAKER_01]: How they've gotten a little bit better from being so sticky.

2196
02:43:57,902 --> 02:44:01,228
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um... Well, I bought Zelda.

2197
02:44:01,829 --> 02:44:03,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you were saying something about this, Loki.

2198
02:44:03,169 --> 02:44:06,250
[SPEAKER_01]: You used to be able to very carefully take those things off and you could put it back on.

2199
02:44:06,270 --> 02:44:08,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we had a guest or somebody was saying something about that.

2200
02:44:08,210 --> 02:44:09,231
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that wasn't me.

2201
02:44:09,271 --> 02:44:09,591
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2202
02:44:26,494 --> 02:44:33,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, well, normally the new stickers can come off very easily now I'm still leaving that sticky residue, right?

2203
02:44:33,380 --> 02:44:40,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I go to take off my sticker on the Zelda copy that I got Well, the front of it's foil Guess what came off?

2204
02:44:53,001 --> 02:44:53,402
[SPEAKER_07]: The Foil

2205
02:45:01,075 --> 02:45:02,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what that means.

2206
02:45:02,275 --> 02:45:03,956
[SPEAKER_07]: They were on to our schemes.

2207
02:45:04,056 --> 02:45:10,777
[SPEAKER_07]: They started reading the internet and they knew that people were just opening them and then trying to return them like they were new.

2208
02:45:11,117 --> 02:45:14,837
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

2209
02:45:14,857 --> 02:45:17,358
[SPEAKER_07]: They deserve it for that crappy policy anyway.

2210
02:45:18,318 --> 02:45:18,938
[SPEAKER_07]: But whatever.

2211
02:45:19,678 --> 02:45:25,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know why I'm trying to sell it like new.

2212
02:45:25,499 --> 02:45:28,520
[SPEAKER_07]: You had actually pre-ordered Zelda and you still got a copy like that?

2213
02:45:30,074 --> 02:45:31,215
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't in the shrink wrap?

2214
02:45:32,436 --> 02:45:33,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no.

2215
02:45:33,776 --> 02:45:34,817
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sealed and everything.

2216
02:45:34,837 --> 02:45:37,478
[SPEAKER_01]: It just still had that big-ass sticker on the front of the box.

2217
02:45:39,359 --> 02:45:45,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and so now when you took it off, now your box has it, and you won't be able to sell it on eBay or anything, huh?

2218
02:45:46,843 --> 02:45:47,083
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

2219
02:45:47,503 --> 02:45:48,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wasn't going to sell it anyway.

2220
02:45:48,904 --> 02:45:50,405
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an eye sore.

2221
02:45:50,645 --> 02:45:52,906
[SPEAKER_08]: So they had a sticker underneath the shrink wrap?

2222
02:45:54,227 --> 02:45:55,668
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

2223
02:45:55,728 --> 02:45:56,348
[SPEAKER_01]: The box to Zelda...

2224
02:45:58,642 --> 02:46:04,025
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like the 25th anniversary for Mario, only the whole box didn't have a flap.

2225
02:46:04,045 --> 02:46:04,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I getcha.

2226
02:46:04,365 --> 02:46:08,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the front of that foil and the big old sticker they had on it took off.

2227
02:46:23,408 --> 02:46:31,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me go this direction because you've actually played the new Zelda then, which is something, despite all the other games that are out right now, we haven't had a chance to play.

2228
02:46:31,572 --> 02:46:32,772
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you like the new Zelda game?

2229
02:46:34,093 --> 02:46:35,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

2230
02:46:36,334 --> 02:46:37,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's amazing.

2231
02:46:38,195 --> 02:46:39,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?

2232
02:46:39,435 --> 02:46:41,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the controls are a little finicky.

2233
02:46:42,717 --> 02:46:48,279
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get used to it because it fully uses the Wii Motion Plus or motion controls, whatever it is.

2234
02:46:49,720 --> 02:46:49,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

2235
02:46:52,228 --> 02:46:53,429
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes in a different direction.

2236
02:46:53,509 --> 02:46:57,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the graphics are a little toned down, but the game is very, very long.

2237
02:46:58,130 --> 02:47:06,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got 30 hours into it and either I really suck or this game is extremely long.

2238
02:47:07,093 --> 02:47:09,754
[SPEAKER_07]: How is it different from Twilight Princess, would you say?

2239
02:47:11,334 --> 02:47:13,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't play very much of Twilight Princess.

2240
02:47:13,655 --> 02:47:14,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, gamer Shane.

2241
02:47:16,796 --> 02:47:20,297
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.

2242
02:47:20,537 --> 02:47:21,097
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like

2243
02:47:21,764 --> 02:47:32,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Any move you make with your Wiimote link on the screen will make that movement.

2244
02:47:34,511 --> 02:47:41,375
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of funny because if you're sitting down playing Zelda, he kind of holds his sword out.

2245
02:47:41,895 --> 02:47:43,436
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks retarded on the screen.

2246
02:47:43,536 --> 02:47:47,338
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just running around with his sword straight up in the air or straight in front of him.

2247
02:47:49,180 --> 02:47:49,900
[SPEAKER_01]: But it will just

2248
02:47:50,794 --> 02:47:53,435
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll mimic the movement of your hand, literally.

2249
02:47:53,675 --> 02:47:59,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like the Wii Motion Plus really added a lot more than maybe sometimes we give it credit for.

2250
02:47:59,157 --> 02:48:01,618
[SPEAKER_07]: The extra technology really kind of added a lot to it.

2251
02:48:03,099 --> 02:48:05,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I've been reading a little bit of hate of that online.

2252
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:08,841
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, oh, well, but it's Zelda.

2253
02:48:08,861 --> 02:48:10,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't they just do it for a controller?

2254
02:48:10,941 --> 02:48:16,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you think about it, with every Zelda game, well, nearly every Zelda game, they've done something different.

2255
02:48:17,464 --> 02:48:17,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

2256
02:48:19,298 --> 02:48:21,559
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, the first one was a top view.

2257
02:48:22,140 --> 02:48:26,262
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one had a top view, but it would also go into side scrolling.

2258
02:48:26,943 --> 02:48:30,245
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, just keep going from there.

2259
02:48:30,465 --> 02:48:37,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides, most of the guys playing this game, their right hand should be in fine shape anyway to wag it around, right?

2260
02:48:38,589 --> 02:48:38,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2261
02:48:39,070 --> 02:48:39,350
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2262
02:48:39,970 --> 02:48:43,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks so much for the call and enjoy Zelda, okay?

2263
02:48:44,773 --> 02:48:45,333
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I will.

2264
02:48:45,474 --> 02:48:46,134
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, have a good one.

2265
02:48:47,869 --> 02:48:52,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Later, 1877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2266
02:48:52,217 --> 02:48:53,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was a new caller.

2267
02:48:53,199 --> 02:48:54,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't recognize that name.

2268
02:48:54,481 --> 02:48:57,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I recognize it from chat right now, but I don't think that person's called in before.

2269
02:48:57,928 --> 02:48:59,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard a little southern accent, didn't you?

2270
02:49:00,578 --> 02:49:00,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little.

2271
02:49:01,099 --> 02:49:01,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard a little.

2272
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:02,200
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2273
02:49:02,721 --> 02:49:04,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, moving on, going back to the Twitters.

2274
02:49:05,504 --> 02:49:06,805
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya sends us a tweet.

2275
02:49:07,126 --> 02:49:11,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming soon to Xbox Live Indie Games, Nyan Cat Adventure.

2276
02:49:11,291 --> 02:49:13,934
[SPEAKER_07]: It is from the people behind Technokitten Adventure.

2277
02:49:14,514 --> 02:49:17,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they are actually creating a Nyan Cat game.

2278
02:49:18,699 --> 02:49:22,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's already a Nyan Cat game for iPhone.

2279
02:49:22,461 --> 02:49:29,185
[SPEAKER_07]: There is on iPhone, but I guess this is the official quote-unquote one that's going to be on Xbox Live.

2280
02:49:29,505 --> 02:49:30,866
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like the little box art.

2281
02:49:30,906 --> 02:49:35,969
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a Facebook that has some limited pictures and stuff, but I love what they did at the bottom.

2282
02:49:36,509 --> 02:49:43,233
[SPEAKER_07]: They made this rip-off of the Nintendo seal of quality, and it's the official Niantendo seal.

2283
02:49:44,854 --> 02:49:47,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope they get that by the Xbox censors.

2284
02:49:48,447 --> 02:50:11,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio let's see more tweets oh I like this one from Mantis Knight on Twitter one topic please discuss is is free to play MMORPGs really a good thing?

2285
02:50:13,934 --> 02:50:16,575
[SPEAKER_07]: are free to play MMOs really a good thing?

2286
02:50:16,695 --> 02:50:17,175
[SPEAKER_04]: hell yes

2287
02:50:18,786 --> 02:50:19,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Depends who it's good for.

2288
02:50:20,149 --> 02:50:23,214
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as being good to get people to try your game, yes.

2289
02:50:24,356 --> 02:50:28,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether people try your game and then decide to pay for stuff, maybe not.

2290
02:50:31,761 --> 02:50:56,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I see no problem because I mean I was paying for Star Trek Online and then had cryptic points so no big there I've heard of where free to play has kind of driven games downhill though or at least according to some of the loyal people who play the game and like one example I could think of for that is Team Fortress 2 now note I'm not saying Team Fortress 2 is a bad game it's not it's a good game

2291
02:50:57,343 --> 02:51:04,125
[SPEAKER_07]: But some people, you might remember we reported on this, when Team Fortress 2 first went free to play, the community was very against that.

2292
02:51:04,768 --> 02:51:27,311
[SPEAKER_07]: and well some I should say some of the community was very against that in fact they went so far remember there were some servers that would ban you if it caught that you were using the free to play version like somehow they could tell the difference and it was like we don't want these people here and sometimes an MMO is like I can imagine a game like DC Universe like one day you're paying for DC Universe right you're paying your $15 a month suddenly the game goes free to play and

2293
02:51:27,871 --> 02:51:32,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Now your servers are drowning under all the people that are trying to get on the server.

2294
02:51:32,633 --> 02:51:38,536
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like where it might be a good thing that more people are playing your game, now it's all these people who didn't pay anything to get in.

2295
02:51:38,576 --> 02:51:41,538
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like they might be ruining the party a little bit.

2296
02:51:41,618 --> 02:51:42,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

2297
02:51:44,749 --> 02:51:45,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is Cloud Cleveland.

2298
02:51:45,930 --> 02:51:47,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been in a chat for a long time.

2299
02:52:07,449 --> 02:52:07,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, bro.

2300
02:52:08,191 --> 02:52:10,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob, you were a Rez fan, right?

2301
02:52:10,838 --> 02:52:11,700
[SPEAKER_03]: For the little Dreamcast?

2302
02:52:11,740 --> 02:52:12,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Freaking love Rez.

2303
02:52:13,064 --> 02:52:14,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy 10-year anniversary.

2304
02:52:14,748 --> 02:52:15,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

2305
02:52:16,300 --> 02:52:16,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

2306
02:52:16,881 --> 02:52:18,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you gotten to play Child of Eden yet?

2307
02:52:18,942 --> 02:52:19,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

2308
02:52:19,403 --> 02:52:20,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I have played Child of Eden.

2309
02:52:20,864 --> 02:52:24,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Child of Eden, I want to play it on the PlayStation 3, for real.

2310
02:52:25,528 --> 02:52:28,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked it, but I thought the Kinect control was a little weird.

2311
02:52:28,771 --> 02:52:32,514
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cool to play once, but I prefer just playing it with a controller.

2312
02:52:32,914 --> 02:52:34,936
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't like the music as much as I liked Rez.

2313
02:52:35,476 --> 02:52:37,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I really didn't, but it was still a good game.

2314
02:52:37,538 --> 02:52:39,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard a lot of people say that, actually, about the music.

2315
02:52:39,339 --> 02:52:39,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

2316
02:52:41,281 --> 02:53:04,756
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that it was bad, it wasn't bad by any means I'm always going to love anything Tetsuya Mizuguchi puts out But it wasn't Rez And the price was tough to swallow But there's a lot of weird stuff that comes out for a high price At least it was better than 5 cars and 3 tracks It was a better game than that, that's for sure

2317
02:53:06,878 --> 02:53:10,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, maybe I'll wait for it to go budget title before I actually pick it up myself.

2318
02:53:10,199 --> 02:53:11,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a lot of Black Friday games.

2319
02:53:11,720 --> 02:53:12,440
[SPEAKER_02]: My gosh, dude.

2320
02:53:14,461 --> 02:53:18,682
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, my god, Mario 3D Land.

2321
02:53:19,302 --> 02:53:26,045
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, between that and Kirby Return to Dream Land, those two games have really put a lot of faith into Nintendo for me.

2322
02:53:26,716 --> 02:53:27,397
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com

2323
02:53:45,374 --> 02:53:46,434
[SPEAKER_07]: How many years has it been?

2324
02:53:46,594 --> 02:53:47,375
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn.

2325
02:53:47,455 --> 02:53:48,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Friend codes?

2326
02:53:48,295 --> 02:53:49,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we always hurt the ones we love?

2327
02:53:50,576 --> 02:53:50,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

2328
02:53:50,896 --> 02:54:05,260
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they go and they put out fucking Mario 3D Land, this Kirby game, which I hear is really good, Zelda, and supposedly, assuming Mario Kart 7 is just as good, it's like, damn.

2329
02:54:05,600 --> 02:54:06,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

2330
02:54:26,008 --> 02:54:26,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.

2331
02:54:26,569 --> 02:54:28,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, now it's completely worth having the Wii for me.

2332
02:54:28,592 --> 02:54:31,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually pulled it out of my closet just to be able to play these games.

2333
02:54:32,578 --> 02:54:36,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And thankfully, you know, the 3DS didn't have to wait as long for some decent games.

2334
02:54:37,365 --> 02:54:39,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully this won't be the end of it.

2335
02:54:39,778 --> 02:54:58,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah it's interesting there's been other stories this week that you know Reggie is saying that just because the Wii U is coming out does not mean the Wii's life cycle is done and I think a lot of us are looking at that with kind of one eyebrow raise like how are the systems going to coexist and I think you kind of have to say that to some extent because like you don't want the Wii's to stop selling this holiday season.

2336
02:54:59,586 --> 02:55:01,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think Xenoblade's gonna come out

2337
02:55:03,048 --> 02:55:17,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that I always go back and forth with this I swore up and down that if they didn't announce it at Penny Arcade it wasn't fucking happening but I'm kind of like you know what else do they fucking have next year they've got to have almost all of their people working on making the Wii U

2338
02:55:18,670 --> 02:55:18,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Better.

2339
02:55:19,471 --> 02:55:21,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's gotta be better at next year's E3.

2340
02:55:21,472 --> 02:55:24,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're gonna see a much different system at next E3.

2341
02:55:24,775 --> 02:55:29,038
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't mean like suddenly it's not gonna have a touch screen anymore or any of that stuff.

2342
02:55:29,058 --> 02:55:33,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I just mean you're gonna definitely see the games and you're gonna see the reason why Nintendo really believes in this.

2343
02:55:33,922 --> 02:55:34,882
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gonna see this at E3.

2344
02:55:34,902 --> 02:55:37,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if they can't prove that, that system is fucked.

2345
02:55:38,505 --> 02:55:45,630
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think because they've got all their people working to make the Wii U great...

2346
02:55:46,527 --> 02:55:46,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

2347
02:56:12,253 --> 02:56:12,894
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2348
02:56:28,471 --> 02:56:30,613
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to do a hardware modification to it.

2349
02:56:31,454 --> 02:56:34,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Will the internet collectively still care this time next year?

2350
02:56:36,259 --> 02:56:39,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Because especially a game like Xenoblade is really for the core gamer.

2351
02:56:39,542 --> 02:56:42,125
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't sell Xenoblade to a soccer mom with her seven-year-olds.

2352
02:56:42,986 --> 02:56:45,909
[SPEAKER_07]: But Xenoblade is a really good game that if you do own a Wii, you should check out.

2353
02:56:48,158 --> 02:56:49,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I want to actually look into that one.

2354
02:56:49,719 --> 02:56:50,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the suggestion.

2355
02:56:50,699 --> 02:57:06,108
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem, except for unless you happen to be in Europe, you won't find it here, or you're going to have to turn to the dark side of the internet, which SOPA may eliminate, so get it now while you still can.

2356
02:57:06,388 --> 02:57:12,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't usually advocate piracy, but when a company leaves you no other choice to play the game, I don't know what else to tell people.

2357
02:57:12,572 --> 02:57:13,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Xenoblade's a great game.

2358
02:57:14,873 --> 02:57:15,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2359
02:57:15,862 --> 02:57:19,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can't get the licensing in your country or whatever.

2360
02:57:20,927 --> 02:57:21,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Other options, man.

2361
02:57:22,088 --> 02:57:22,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

2362
02:57:23,449 --> 02:57:27,273
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, anything else you want to ask or get out with the show tonight?

2363
02:57:28,974 --> 02:57:29,875
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's about it, bro.

2364
02:57:30,176 --> 02:57:33,499
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, thanks so much for your call, and have fun with Child of Eden.

2365
02:57:33,519 --> 02:57:34,039
[SPEAKER_07]: You should get it.

2366
02:57:34,780 --> 02:57:37,182
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to see a lot of good sales through the holiday, so definitely check it out.

2367
02:57:39,184 --> 02:57:39,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

2368
02:57:39,504 --> 02:57:40,165
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, take care, buddy.

2369
02:57:42,192 --> 02:57:47,145
[SPEAKER_07]: One 877 game OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2370
02:57:48,968 --> 02:57:49,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Love to hear from you.

2371
02:57:50,049 --> 02:57:51,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I finish all the tweets or was there one?

2372
02:57:51,529 --> 02:57:53,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we were still on the free-to-play thing.

2373
02:57:53,690 --> 02:57:54,571
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about that.

2374
02:57:54,811 --> 02:58:01,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura, you were talking about kind of even your experiences, you know, the Star Wars, or Star Trek, thank you.

2375
02:58:01,994 --> 02:58:03,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I really should know better.

2376
02:58:03,055 --> 02:58:06,256
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would just be certain things that I would want, and they would be very reasonable.

2377
02:58:06,837 --> 02:58:15,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I could get a thing of the lowest end of cryptic points or something, and it would last me through, like, months of releases.

2378
02:58:15,821 --> 02:58:16,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2379
02:58:16,321 --> 02:58:16,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

2380
02:58:19,246 --> 02:58:23,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Since the phone's not ringing again, I think we're actually going to shut it down because believe it or not, this has been a long show tonight.

2381
02:58:24,028 --> 02:58:27,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially considering our website is down and we weren't able to do a proper show roll.

2382
02:58:27,630 --> 02:58:28,690
[SPEAKER_07]: We did a good job filling time.

2383
02:58:29,231 --> 02:58:29,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got to wrap up.

2384
02:58:30,711 --> 02:58:31,752
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it for the tweets too.

2385
02:58:33,032 --> 02:58:36,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've got to get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap up.

2386
02:58:36,254 --> 02:58:38,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we already did last minute stories.

2387
02:58:38,615 --> 02:58:41,416
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get everybody's last minute thoughts.

2388
02:58:42,576 --> 02:58:46,198
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought tonight is I'm excited to go home and eat.

2389
02:58:46,298 --> 02:58:46,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, food.

2390
02:58:46,918 --> 02:58:47,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I love food.

2391
02:58:47,839 --> 02:58:48,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

2392
02:58:49,079 --> 02:58:51,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Making good headway on Call of Duty 4 modding.

2393
02:58:52,721 --> 02:58:54,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2394
02:58:54,742 --> 02:58:55,783
[SPEAKER_04]: My night is far from over.

2395
02:58:58,601 --> 02:59:01,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.

2396
02:59:01,882 --> 02:59:14,366
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate your support, especially when poopy things happen to us like our internet goes out so we can't do a show one week randomly or our website suddenly goes down.

2397
02:59:14,666 --> 02:59:16,527
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate that you guys stand by with us.

2398
02:59:16,927 --> 02:59:27,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I know the podcasties will be a little bit behind, we still had a very full chat room tonight and I really appreciate that, all things considered, considering we don't have a website where you can go to chat.orangenloungeradio.com or any of that.

2399
02:59:27,410 --> 02:59:48,964
[SPEAKER_07]: so really appreciate you guys if you like what you heard we're not begging for your money all we ask tell people about the show word of mouth help spread the word about the show tell a person who may not have heard of it about the show and help the OL Army grow and we can spread the word the term of Xbox Lube throughout the universe

2400
02:59:49,884 --> 03:00:06,837
[SPEAKER_07]: that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio we'll be back next week hopefully with a website and everything to do it all over again with next week in gaming news and I'm sure even more games to be played this week including it sounds like Mario Kart 7 by this time next week right?

2401
03:00:07,277 --> 03:00:19,427
[SPEAKER_07]: the 4th oh my god so much more coming so we'll be back next week until then have a great week and don't be a dick to each other online you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
