00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All Games Radio is now broadcasting live from Sacramento, California.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Up next, Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The following program is intended for mature audiences.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loki.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Tonight, November 27th, 2011, a special connect for Windows is detailed.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
One group of people want Skyrim to be banned.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And is Sony planning an answer to Smash Brothers?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We are live at All Games Radio, where we do tape live every Sunday night

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
www.allgames.com if you want to tune in to listen.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Also, joining us, excuse me, my name is Rob Roberts.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I should introduce myself first, then I'll introduce the co-host.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Like, who's this guy? I just downloaded this show. Who's this guy?

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm Rob Roberts, and joining me as they always do, week after week,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
for the past nine and a half years, say hello to the one and only

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hi.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How are you?

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm almost full.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah?

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I made lamb leg with parsnips in the slow cooker.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And then I took the broth, so it's got all that good meat fat in it.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Food, food, food, food, food, food, food.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And cooked quinoa in it, so now my quinoa's creamy.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Now, I notice in your other hand, you have an old friend of the show

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
who's been gone for, like, several years.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He ran away to die.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Makes his triumphant return to the show tonight.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Are you gonna say hello?

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, but this is gonna break your heart, or my heart, anyway.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
All right, here we go.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, he's working now.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He was going...

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
When I pressed it earlier.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's the O.L.R. Ferret, the official orange laundry...

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, God.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He's not doing healthy after all these years.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He might need to have an operation.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You might have to open up his butt and replace the battery.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Gosh.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well...

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, but look at that face.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The orange laundry radio ferret is slowly dying, ladies and gentlemen.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Just like the quality of this program.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Say hello as well.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He's gonna model my quinoa.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't know why you're bothering to take a picture of it,

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
because we have no website right now, but hey.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The flicker still works.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's true, the flicker still works.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Get it up there when it comes back.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Joining us as well, hopefully not about to soon die.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He'll be with us for a long, long time.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, you can replace the batteries in those by cutting the stomach open.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We need an operation.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I did that one time.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Remember, we had like four ferrets at one time.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I do.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't know where they went.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You came into the show one time and you were like,

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hey, Jamie, here.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And you threw like five ferrets at her.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And I held them all the entire episode because they were my babies.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We mailed one to one of our friends in Colorado, Rai Chan.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't know if she still listens, but she's out there.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I think we gave another one to a long time OLR listener.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Didn't one of them get stuck to a Katamari?

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, we put one on the giant Katamari ball, one E3.

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We did that.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So they kind of slowly went their separate ways.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And now we have the old school original one is still here.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So our little unofficial official mascot of Orange Laundry radio.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So yeah, a lot of things are broken.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Not only is my introduction broken tonight, but in the ferret is slowly dying.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But obviously we weren't here last week because of the last minute internet

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
failure.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It was not a planned absence for us.

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But unfortunately, the internet was down at dark sacros all day long.

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Right.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Like, and you were having problems before that.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, yeah.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Every time it rains, Comcast goes for fuck's sake.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So but thankfully.

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So around four o'clock that day, we just had to make a decision like,

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
OK, well, we can't even really tape a show without internet because we use

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
internet to get our stories and to do some of the other incidental background

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
music and stuff.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So we couldn't do a show period.

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We said, and we'll just take the week off anyway.

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's right before Thanksgiving.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So whatever.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
A lot of shows are going to be off.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We're back here tonight to news that we don't have a website right now.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I know when you go to Orange Laundry radio.com,

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
it says something about an account billing issue.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's actually not the issue.

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's not something as obvious as Rob didn't pay the bill.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Is the man bringing us down?

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It is.

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It is.

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's SOPA.

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It went into effect, everybody.

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Unfortunately, because we play music during the show.

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No, it's not.

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's the one percent.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's the man.

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No, here's the thing.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Our website space has been graciously donated for the past.

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
When did we move off of my personal domain?

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It was about seven years ago.

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So, I mean, it was a long, long time ago.

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We were on live 365.

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Let me put it that way.

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It was a long time ago.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We had our website.

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's been graciously donated by one of our listeners and friends,

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
IRL and former DER Freak moderator when there was a DDR Freak, VX Jason XV.

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And, you know, he's been able to get the web space for us.

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I think it's like a friend of a friend thing.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And unfortunately, when things break, because we don't pay for it,

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
that doesn't mean things get fixed right away.

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So we have to understand that, you know, beggars can't be choosers.

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So he is aware.

130
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He's working on it.

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't pester him about it.

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He knows.

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I know he's working really hard to try and fix it one way or another,

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
even if that ends up meaning we have to kind of get web space somewhere else.

135
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So keep an eye on our Twitter at twitter.com slash O-L-R or our Facebook.

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And we'll let you know what's going on with the website as we know.

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Unfortunately, this does mean that it affects the podcast folks,

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
because without a website, we can't deliver the podcast.

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So the only people here in the show right now are our live listeners.

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And it probably won't make the feed tonight,

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
which is unfortunate because we've been on a really good track record

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
of getting the show up for the Monday morning crowd.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And sadly, it won't be there for them tonight.

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But we'll get it up as soon as we possibly can.

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So hopefully, you podcastees will be listening to this before too long.

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So let's see.

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Going to our chat room.

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Our chat room is still there.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And usually, I say join us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com,

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
but that's not going to work due to the website outage.

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So tonight, you can do it one of two ways.

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You go to Game Search, which is our network on – well, not our network,

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
but the network we use on IRC.

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Gamesurge.net and any IRC clients, there's an IRC.

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And you join Channel Orange Lounge.

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Honestly, if that's too difficult, just go to chat.allgames.com

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and they'll point you in the right direction.

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And my apologies to the fine folks at All Games Chat,

159
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
but they'll understand, I hope.

160
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So anyhow, before we get into our gaming weeks and all that,

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I thought we could talk a little bit about this.

162
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's something I kind of wanted to talk about last week.

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We didn't end up having a show.

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Sorry.

165
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's not your fault. Just things happen.

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We'll talk a little bit about charity.

167
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Because, you know, tis the season.

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's the holidays and stuff.

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And this is the season where charity donations

170
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and things like that really kick into high gear.

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You know, as people are out spending like mad,

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
killing each other over $2 waffle irons and so forth.

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You know, there's –

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Waffle irons for $2?

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Waffle irons for $2, you say?

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, just try not to get clobbered with one.

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You see the YouTube of all them people fighting over $2 waffle irons?

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's quite a sight to be held.

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's stupid. You want to hear something else that's stupid?

180
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We got back after having Thanksgiving dinner with our family,

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and we came home and we're like,

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
crap, there's like nothing to do.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's watch TV.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hey, look. Lady Gaga's having a Thanksgiving special.

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I didn't see it, believe it or not.

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
She made waffles with –

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
or I wouldn't say she made waffles.

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
A chef that makes food for her was making waffles with salami in them.

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's weird, but I'd try it.

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Were you tempted by Gaga's delicious waffles?

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think you were.

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Waffles are good, but it was weird.

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Waffle Gaga.

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Lady Waf Waf.

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That sounds kind of dirty.

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It does a little bit.

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So anyhow, charity. Hello.

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Going back to charity.

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I know Child's Play is obviously one of the biggest gamer charities,

200
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and they've kicked off their official donation season,

201
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
you know, during the holidays.

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
There's been a lot of stuff going on, like Desert Bus.

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Gosh, this has been, what, the fifth year I think that's been going on.

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If you don't know what Desert Bus is,

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't think you've been following a lot of the gaming internet stuff,

206
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
but we'll explain it anyway.

207
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There's this game that came out on –

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
God, what system was Desert Bus on?

209
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Was that a 3DO game?

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It was on some obscure-ish system, wasn't it?

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That was on the Sega CD.

212
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That was part of the – wasn't that part of the Penn and Teller game?

213
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That was on the Sega CD.

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Was it the Sega CD?

216
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It was Penn and Teller's up in – or Smoke and Mirrors.

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I knew it was one of those CD systems I didn't have.

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And, like, you drive a bus for, like, the whole thing.

219
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And the deal is you drive a bus from L.A. to Vegas,

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
but don't expect the graphics to look like, you know,

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
burnout or something.

222
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Wasn't the whole thing is that they hate video games or something,

223
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
so they made a video game or –

224
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah.

225
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah.

226
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So –

227
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Or something about the realism or something.

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, and you really drive the actual distance.

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's not abbreviated.

230
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And you're not allowed to drive above a certain mileage

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
because you're driving a bus.

232
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So to drive from one to the other takes, like, four hours.

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And all you do – and you can't just, like, rubber-band the button down

234
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
or anything because every so often you have to slightly adjust your steering

235
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
or the bus will go off track.

236
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, because the alignment's not correct.

237
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Exactly.

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So when you make it all the way, you score one point.

239
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It takes, like, four hours to do so.

240
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So these crazy guys actually put together this whole thing

241
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
where they drive back and forth for – I think they went for six days this year.

242
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They played desert.

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't think it was the same guy, but this group did it for, like,

244
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
six days straight and they raised a shit-ton of money for Child's Play,

245
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
which is great.

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well over $300,000.

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Something we've talked about a lot on this show is something a little more local to us that goes on,

248
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and that's UmLoud, which is, again, happening this year, December 8th.

249
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
On – it's a Thursday this year.

250
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And Dark Soccer and myself, I believe we're both going to be there this year.

251
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We're going.

252
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So we hope to see you guys there.

253
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco.

254
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There's going to be an online component this year.

255
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I guess more information on that is coming soon.

256
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So even if you don't live in the San Francisco area, there is going to be ways you can participate,

257
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
but the details on that are forthcoming.

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And the other thing I'd mention, too, in case you want to experience Desert Bus,

259
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
it is now on iOS and Android marketplaces.

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes. Yes, it is. It is.

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And apparently there's a pop-up version.

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Which is nice because they actually donate all the proceeds for the iOS 1 to the Child's Play charity.

263
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And I want to say, wasn't that the one where Penn Jillette actually ended up donating money?

264
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't think it was this year. I think it was last year or something.

265
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He donated quite a bit of money. Like, he actually knew about it.

266
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So it's kind of neat.

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So anyhow, lots of charity stuff going on.

268
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So, you know, think about some of that money you saved on all those Black Friday sales or Steam sales or so forth.

269
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Think about giving it to a good cause.

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And even if that cause is not Child's Play for you, maybe it's, I don't know, St. Jude's Hospital,

271
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
March for Babies, American Red Cross, whatever the charity is.

272
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Although about the American Red Cross, though, keep your money out of those guys

273
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
ringing the bells in front of retail stores.

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The Salvation Army?

275
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah, I thought that was Red Cross, but Salvation Army.

276
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't give them any money because, especially now, I guess they're taking credit cards as well.

277
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I mean, do I really want to slide a credit card through a skimmer that they may have

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
so that I can hopefully get the money going to them and not some crook?

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Just do it through online if you're going to do that.

280
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Do you have views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio? Not necessarily?

281
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Alright, anyway.

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Well, actually, they have caught a number of scammers.

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Just be careful. Always be careful.

284
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Get a receipt.

285
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Do it through the websites.

286
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Or just do Desert Bus or UMLoud because those are two ones we know, or Child's Play themselves,

287
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and those are several different ones we know are reputable and all that.

288
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Anyhow, let's move on. Let's talk about video games and how was your gaming week,

289
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the video games you've been playing this week.

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't know about you guys, but I've played a ton, so let's go around the table.

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We'll start with Dark Soccer. Ladies first.

292
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, I actually played some stuff while my internet was sort of working.

293
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I actually played a lot of Droplets, Rob.

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's that random-ass puzzle game that's on Steam, huh?

295
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, it's actually pretty funny. Funny. Fun, I should say.

296
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't want to say it's like Pipe Dream, but it does involve pipes and water going through,

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
but it's all like they're falling.

298
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But you run out of drops.

299
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah, it's kind of interesting.

300
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And you have to collect them in your reservoir and get more,

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and you can actually get little pockets that will open up that you can get more drops.

302
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And so you get a score as long as you have drops to play with.

303
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Actually, I have to look at my Steam list because I have to look at what I was like.

304
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I actually played a bunch of Portal 2 as well, just, you know, again, while my internet was not working.

305
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Let me throw this out there while you're pulling up the list,

306
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
because actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrady.com

307
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
is jumping in on the charity discussion with another suggestion,

308
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and that is do the Humble Indie Bundle.

309
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And that's a very good point, because the Humble Indie Bundle,

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
that money you can choose if you want the money to go all to the developers

311
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
or you want to go all to Child's Play or EFF.

312
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You can, you know, kind of choose how the money is distributed.

313
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't think they have a bundle going on right now.

314
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There's a different type of bundle we're going to talk about a little later in the show,

315
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
but as far as the gaming bundle, there's nothing right now,

316
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
but there probably will be one soon enough.

317
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Those have been doing very well, so we'll see.

318
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I was also playing some Doom 2.

319
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And, where else was I? Oh yeah, I was playing Peggle Extreme.

320
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I tried to play Magica, but while my internet was down, it was like,

321
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
no, you can't play this game.

322
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And then a few people actually all gave me the same game.

323
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It gave me Fallout New Vegas.

324
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Gee, tough problem.

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Wait, wait, several people bought you Fallout New Vegas?

326
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I know it was on sale earlier this week.

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I guess so. I mean, maybe it was like...

328
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Was it on your wish list or something?

329
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I think it might have been.

330
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Ah, there you go.

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I mean, I can look, but yeah, Fallout New Vegas is actually really sweet.

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I put up a couple of screenies from, I can pull up my Steam account

333
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and show people a few screenies, but I mean,

334
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I had never really had much of an interest in playing it,

335
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
but when I started playing it, it really,

336
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I had friends that played the RPG and kind of seeing their books

337
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and seeing how the game set up, it actually kind of seemed like the same,

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
you know, had the same feel, except then you're, you know,

339
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
first person or you can play third person.

340
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You can play behind the shoulder.

341
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So I didn't actually get as bad motion sick as I might have.

342
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
However, I am incredibly lost after killing a few geckos in the face,

343
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
which is funny because they die ugly and I think it's awesome,

344
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and I'm playing some chick with red hair.

345
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Some chick with red hair.

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Some chick with red hair.

347
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I was corrected in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There is a Humble Bundle going on right now. I'm so sorry.

349
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I was not aware. This is news to me.

350
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
This is one I might have to purchase.

351
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There is a Humble Bundle going on right now.

352
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And guess what? Dark Soccer, this may interest you

353
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
because it is the Humble Introversion Bundle.

354
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And if you don't know what game they did,

355
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
they're the folks behind Darwinia.

356
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So Darwinia is in this bundle as well as Uplink, Defcon,

357
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Multiwinia is all in this.

358
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And if you pay more than the average, which right now is $3.75,

359
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
gosh, that's so low.

360
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I would hope you'd pay at least like $10 or $20 for this.

361
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Aquaria and Crayon Physics Deluxe get thrown in as well.

362
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So there is a bundle going on right now. My apologies.

363
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't know. How much longer is that going for?

364
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is that like just tonight or is that going into next week?

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Let's see. Eight days left. Oh shit.

366
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So you've got some time there.

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You got at least another week.

368
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Usually if you wait to the end, there's more stuff tacked on.

369
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Looks like they've already done it.

370
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah. All right. Well, go for it.

371
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If you buy early, you still get the extra stuff that they end up adding.

372
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And what I really like about the way Humble Bundle does it

373
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
is that you get steam codes for everything.

374
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So like I bought it and then I just loaded it all into steam

375
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
the last time I bought one, which was the bundle that had VVVVV in it.

376
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So yeah, pretty cool.

377
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh yeah, I've actually played more than, oh yeah, I did play wow for the record.

378
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm working on my rep with the Sha'tari Skyguard.

379
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Good times.

380
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So I can fly around on a fat short manta ray.

381
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There's a birthday party going on a while right now.

382
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh yeah, that thing.

383
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It messes up my look, Rob.

384
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And just a little quick side note.

385
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What?

386
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Whoever that freaking Taran was that was killing all of my birds?

387
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
DIAF. The end.

388
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

389
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And this is going to be continuing on

390
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
because we're not playing Grand Theft Auto anymore.

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We're playing Call of Duty now.

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This is weird to me.

393
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This is modern warfare. I'm still kicking ass though.

394
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And you know what?

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You've turned into a bro.

396
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's been, what, less than a week and I'm already trying to mod the game.

397
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So I'm working on a mod for...

398
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Dan's yelling from the other room.

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Make it not suck.

400
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I have a tangent about bros I want to talk about in a minute.

401
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But yeah, it's been pretty fun.

402
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
We're playing hardcore mode because they don't like the fact that

403
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I could kill faster if I have a map and I can kind of see where people are firing from.

404
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm still killing pretty fast anyways.

405
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But we're just kind of playing around right now.

406
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
System Link. And it's been fun.

407
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's been great because we don't have any lag.

408
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And we don't have the problem with disconnects because our internet's terrible at work.

409
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We'd get disconnected from games all the time in Grand Theft Auto.

410
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And funny enough now we see,

411
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, disconnect from live. Oh, that doesn't matter because we're not playing on live.

412
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So we have that.

413
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But yeah, I am working on something actually kind of unique for it.

414
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Just like some special balance mod thing where each class would have different weapons

415
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and a special ability kind of like a button or something that you would have a one minute ability

416
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
that would be like god mode or invisibility or something like that.

417
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And then with a five minute cooldown for each thing.

418
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So it's really intricate but you can actually program quite a bit in Call of Duty which is kind of cool.

419
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So I'm going to mess around with that.

420
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Actually hopefully I'm going to mess around with Grand Theft Auto mods at some point

421
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
because I've just been really distracted by everything.

422
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I've played Saints Row. I've pretty much beat Saints Row.

423
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Actually I have beat Saints Row. Almost 100%.

424
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
All the side missions and stuff were done except for the car thefts.

425
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And those are really annoying because it's really glitched.

426
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The one I was on now, apparently every time you go into the zone to steal the car,

427
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
it just for some reason explodes or just is gone.

428
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And I don't understand why because it's just something with the game. It's broken.

429
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So I can't really do that.

430
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But there's I guess ways around it and I'll eventually go back to it.

431
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But for the most part I have everything done.

432
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I just have to play through the game again to finish some missions in a different way.

433
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Like Act 1, finish that in a different way.

434
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And then also the third act I have to finish.

435
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Or Murder Brawl, I have to do that a different way.

436
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Did the Tron parody stuff in Saints Row end up being good or was it just kind of...

437
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah, that's pretty much what you saw in the video.

438
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They had some interesting stuff.

439
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
There's even a little bit of Zork in there.

440
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Awesome. Do you get eaten by a Gru?

441
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:45,000
No, there's actually a text adventure part that you have to do a little bit of stuff there.

442
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But it's pretty awesome.

443
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Do you end up in front of a house and there is a white mailbox here?

444
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Something like that. It's a parody of it.

445
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You have to go kill a unicorn is what it is.

446
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Damn you unicorns!

447
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So there's something with that. But what's kind of cool is the perks you get from beating that portion of the game.

448
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You actually get one of the combat tanks.

449
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You get to drive around the city and fire it.

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And it has all the sound effects from combat.

451
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Which is great. It's a big blocky tank.

452
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And then they also have these bikes you can get that are like...

453
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You get a bike and a car that look like Tron stuff.

454
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So that's pretty awesome.

455
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But yeah, it's pretty sweet. And then after you beat the game, obviously you can mess around and just do whatever.

456
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But now I have to get all the achievements for it.

457
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Because I'm almost done. I have almost everything.

458
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So I have to play through as a woman now.

459
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So I'll be making a Dark Sakura character since you already have a character.

460
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And I have a character.

461
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Apparently Travis Donovan at Undersedation Live, our buddies that are on Saturday night at All Games Radio.

462
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Travis Donovan made a Rob Roberts character in Saints Row who wears bunny slippers and a Hello Kitty backpack.

463
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Although it's not really Hello Kitty but it's their answer to that.

464
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So you can do all that stuff.

465
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He has to play through the game as a girl so he's gonna make the Dark Sakura character.

466
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm afraid.

467
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
She'll be wearing all black and kill things with fire.

468
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Okay.

469
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I kill things with fire.

470
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I approve of the killing with fire.

471
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But what's great about it is you can actually go on the website.

472
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
She should have a giant menorah she whaps people with.

473
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I would not do that to my menorah.

474
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
They don't have that.

475
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What's kind of cool though is you can go on the website and you can actually tag different characters you want to download to your game.

476
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So anybody that listens to the show can go find Travis Donovan's character or you can link to it or whatever.

477
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And they go tag it and then download it into their game and play as you in their game.

478
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Which is awesome.

479
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And I forgot to bring you a copy of the game today.

480
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That's alright.

481
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I had one.

482
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I've got so much I'm trying to play right now anyway I can use another one.

483
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But you really should play Saints Row the Third.

484
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I really do want to play Saints Row the Third especially knowing that somebody else made my damn character.

485
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It is awesome.

486
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But it actually turned out really good.

487
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I saw the pictures and I'm like that's cute.

488
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's such a great game.

489
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's seriously, I enjoyed every minute of it and I played it for almost, no I did play it for over 30 hours because I got that achievement.

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
30 and 30 so, 3 and 30 I guess.

491
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So I did play over 30 hours of the game.

492
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And so yeah aside from that I've been playing Skyrim which is great.

493
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I almost gave it up pretty quick because the first time I played the game something glitched out.

494
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And I went to the first town I'm supposed to go to and everyone started attacking me.

495
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Trying to kill me.

496
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm like, okay what the fuck.

497
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I can't do anything because you guys keep trying to attack me.

498
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Except for the one character I was supposed to talk to.

499
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
He was fine but everyone's like trying to kill me.

500
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm like, okay.

501
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I don't understand why they did the piss everybody off.

502
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So the hell with this.

503
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So I finally tried it again and I'm really enjoying it because now it's actually working correctly.

504
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You might have accidentally murdered somebody.

505
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Maybe.

506
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Maybe I hit somebody with a sword.

507
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Maybe I decapitated somebody and forgot.

508
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Oops.

509
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Well I had something earlier that I ran into.

510
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I decided to go exploring off and then I see this giant attacking these two people.

511
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So I'm going to go help them.

512
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So I started shooting fire at the giant.

513
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So people started coming and attacking me.

514
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Because I guess some of the splash damage started hitting them.

515
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm like, you fucking idiots.

516
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So what? You got injured a little bit.

517
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I killed the giant for you.

518
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
For such an enormously, enormous game.

519
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
A game as vast as Skyrim.

520
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It does really have its derpy moments.

521
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
There's some real things in Skyrim that just don't make sense.

522
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It should be like if you do a little bit of damage to somebody.

523
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
They're like, hey, don't do that or something.

524
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And then if you continually do that, then they should start attacking you.

525
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But not just like, oh, I accidentally dealt a little bit of damage to you.

526
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Or like, oh, you ran in front of my arrow or something like that.

527
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And unfortunately you got stuck with an arrow.

528
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
They should have a little bit of like, you know, kind of, hey, stop that.

529
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And then start attacking you if you keep attacking them.

530
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I think that would be a little bit better than, oh, I accidentally hit you with a fireball.

531
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Because I was aiming at the troll that's right next to you or something like that.

532
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Anyways.

533
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I like some of the lolsy stuff people have done with Skyrim online.

534
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Like the house full of cabbage.

535
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Have you seen that stuff?

536
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I had to fight, once again, exploring.

537
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Because I'm trying to get enough money to buy these boots that allow me to pick up more things.

538
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Which is ironic because I got the money, the amount of money that was in the game to do that.

539
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And all of a sudden I go back down to buy them.

540
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh, and now they're more expensive.

541
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm like, fuck you, I'm not buying those anymore.

542
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But I have a lot of money now.

543
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So I've been just exploring in places probably that I'm not supposed to be going yet.

544
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And one of the places I found, all of a sudden I got attacked by three wisps.

545
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And I was like, oh, this sucks because I'm only like level, I think I'm like level eight.

546
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Or six at the time, I think, when I had attacked them.

547
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So I was like, ah shit, these things look magical.

548
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That's not good.

549
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So I killed them.

550
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And then it was the wisp mother that was there started shooting like some ice thing at me.

551
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And so I decided to go try to kill her.

552
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And that took about 15 to 20 minutes to actually take her down because I'm such a low level character.

553
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah, but they level with you so it would have taken 15 to 20 minutes anyway.

554
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Really?

555
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You do get a little bit of edge because of the talents and so forth that you get.

556
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But unfortunately the enemies, it's not like a Final Fantasy where if you just grind, grind, grind, you'll be able to overpower everything.

557
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It doesn't work like that.

558
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But anyways, so yeah.

559
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Honestly, in any Elder Scrolls game you should just do the main story first.

560
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So that way you can just do it when it's easy and then go back and do open world lulzy fun.

561
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Maybe we should do that then.

562
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
That's the way to approach an Elder Scrolls game, I really think.

563
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So yeah, it took me about 15 minutes.

564
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But it's funny because, you know, you were saying the house full of cabbages and stuff.

565
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And the game's not exactly realistic.

566
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,000
At one point, because I had a bunch of stuff from crafting things, either making food or making alchemy and stuff like that.

567
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So I got to the point where I had exhausted my potions that I had with me and I'm like, crap, I need more health.

568
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So I ate 13 pounds of food at one point to level up.

569
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Your skill in pooping has increased to 21.

570
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's just ridiculous.

571
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's like, okay, here's this two pound cheese wheel.

572
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
This will give you two health.

573
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm going to eat four of those.

574
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I can imagine this guy, like, high behind a rock, just shoving his mouth full of cabbage and carrots and raw rabbit.

575
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Just all sorts of ridiculous stuff that you happen to be carrying with you.

576
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And I also found another way. It was kind of fun.

577
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I was really sad because remember how they had the thing where, oh, you can steal from people by putting pots over people's heads?

578
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I thought that was only on PC.

579
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Until I figured out you have to hold A and then you can move shit around.

580
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I was like, oh, thank God.

581
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It doesn't work, though. I haven't gotten it to work at all.

582
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Maybe there's a trick to it. I've never tried it.

583
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Which is too bad.

584
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But it allowed me to, you know, because one of the things I kind of do is I pick up everything that is not attached.

585
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Which is great because you do missions for people and stuff and all of a sudden they become friendly with you.

586
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And they'll just let you take everything.

587
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Like, I did a mission for the guy at the trading post or whatever.

588
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And after that, everything in that house allowed me to take it almost, except for expensive armor and stuff.

589
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Guys, you know in our chatroom at chat.ownerswannatrader.com disagrees with me on what I'm saying about the level scaling.

590
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Saying the enemies don't really level with you anymore in Skyrim, Rob.

591
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
They changed it due to people not liking it in Oblivion. It's more like Fallout now, really.

592
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I could have sworn somebody was telling me that they were playing the game twice and saw the difference.

593
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But maybe it's not as much of a weight as it was before.

594
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Who knows?

595
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
But I like being able to overpower everything, personally.

596
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I hope that's true.

597
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I haven't played enough Skyrim. I really haven't because I've been distracted by so many other games.

598
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I probably will not give Skyrim proper attention until Christmas time.

599
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Skyrim's hilarious, because at one point I was like,

600
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Oh, hey, wait a second. I can swim in the river.

601
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm diving underwater, and I'm catching salmon.

602
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
For no apparent reason, other than I can.

603
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
That's the whole thing about Skyrim. I don't know why I'm doing this. I can.

604
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Or Skyrim with the physics.

605
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Hey, you can go along this mountain trail, or you can just walk straight up the mountain.

606
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You'll just hit jump a lot, and you'll eventually climb the mountain.

607
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
That's what I do.

608
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But yeah, I found out that if you're carrying too much, obviously it slows you down.

609
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So what you can do is grab one more object by holding A, and it'll just hover out in front of you,

610
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and then you just run back to town.

611
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Of course, if you get to any doorway, you'll pick it up, take it in your inventory, walk through the door,

612
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
drop it, and pick it up again using the hold A thing, and just keep on running.

613
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It was great. I was able to take one.

614
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I brought you a pan!

615
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I was able to take one more battle axe.

616
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
How stupid must that look?

617
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Alright, Bobby has joined chat to try and clarify.

618
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Our good friend Bobby Blackwolf, who tapes before us live at All Games Radio,

619
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
to try and clarify, bring a little clarity to the Rim of Sky.

620
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Sky says, here's how it works.

621
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Or Blackwolf says, Sky, here's how it works.

622
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
When you first enter a dungeon area, it generates the enemies to your level.

623
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
If you leave that dungeon, go level up, and go back in.

624
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
They will be the same level they used to be, so you can overpower them, but not on the first entry.

625
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Now, that makes a lot of sense.

626
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So, here's what you need to do.

627
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You need to find all the dungeons at level one.

628
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Like I'm saying, go do the story mode right away.

629
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And then that way, you know...

630
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm going to, but I get distracted so much.

631
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I know. I hear you.

632
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Seriously, I have taken everything in that town, the first town, the Riverwood, whatever,

633
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and I've taken everything that has not been bolted down.

634
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's great. There's so many glitches in the game.

635
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Did you fill a house with cabbage?

636
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I don't have a house to fill with cabbage yet, but I have a lot of cabbage.

637
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Well, damn it, now you have a mission.

638
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And I've eaten a lot of cabbage, too, so that's not good.

639
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Anything else about your gaming week?

640
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We could talk about Skyrim all night.

641
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Seriously. Like, for example, one of the tricks you can level up any skill

642
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
by those people that will actually tell you, like, the first town you go to,

643
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
there's an elf there that will help you improve your archery.

644
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Well, if you invite him into, you can invite him to join you,

645
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and he'll come and help you, so you go and you pay for that,

646
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and then you go, I need to trade with you, and you take your money back,

647
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and then you pay him again and take your money back.

648
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
In fact, the other thing is, you can take his house key for no reason,

649
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
or just take all of his inventory, and then you go to his house and steal everything.

650
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And then go to the middle of the forest and say, okay, wait here.

651
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Pretty much.

652
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm always, like, I'm paranoid that my stupid NPC that always follows me,

653
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I have this chick named Lydia that follows me everywhere,

654
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and I'm always paranoid she's gonna die.

655
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Like, I'm like, because this game, like, if a fucking wolf bites her head off,

656
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
she's not coming back.

657
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Like, she won't just flash and then respawn.

658
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But here's the thing, though. Some of these NPCs don't die.

659
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Because one of the things I did before I came over here, I was like,

660
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
hey, you know what, let me see how, if I could just kill everybody in this town.

661
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So I saved it before I did that, and I tried to kill everybody.

662
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I killed everybody except for the goddamn woman that works in the inn.

663
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You can kill her. First, she's a really tough son of a bitch.

664
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And then, on top of that...

665
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You mean daughter of a bitch?

666
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Whatever.

667
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
How about bitch?

668
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah, she's a really tough bitch.

669
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And then on top of that, you kill her, and she doesn't really die.

670
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
She just comes back to life again and starts fucking trying to kill you again.

671
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
She might be integral to the story or something.

672
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Like, you probably can't kill people that, like, keep you from completing the actual story.

673
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Eh, I don't care. I know. I know you don't care.

674
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Just finish the story, then go do whatever you want. Whatever you want.

675
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Burn a whole village down for all I care, then wait for the DLC.

676
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Alright. Anything else for your gaming week?

677
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Uh... a little bit of Zuma. That's it.

678
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Let me move on. I got some games I want to talk about.

679
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I've played a lot. I can only talk about some of the games I've played this week,

680
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
because I've played a lot in the past couple weeks since we last had a show.

681
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So let me start with the one I've probably played the least of,

682
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
which is Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

683
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I bought this more for Alan because he wanted it.

684
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And keep in mind, we didn't own Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

685
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's like we knew that they were going to release a new version just nine months later.

686
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So we ordered that over Amazon.

687
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
They always do.

688
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I know. I know that for next time now.

689
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So I'm going to be wary about buying Capcom games when they first come out.

690
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Like, I'm going to have to be convinced they're not going to release an Uber edition six months later.

691
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But anyway, so it's really my first taste of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at all.

692
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
The controls are weird because I guess they took more of a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom direction with them.

693
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah, exactly.

694
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Not a fan.

695
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Much easier if you've got the arcade controller.

696
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah, I could see that. I could see that.

697
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So I'm not a fan because I like my games like Street Fighter, but that's okay.

698
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The art style is really good.

699
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's so fun to play on an HDTV with awesome sound.

700
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
The graphics and everything look great.

701
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Lots of great characters.

702
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Some weird choices, especially on the Capcom side, but okay.

703
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Rocket Raccoon.

704
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
No, I said it on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.

705
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
That's Marvel.

706
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Rocket Raccoon is Marvel.

707
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I know.

708
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I said weird choices on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.

709
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Right, but that's a weird one.

710
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah, it is weird.

711
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I hear you.

712
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That's what I was saying.

713
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I thought you liked Rocket Raccoon.

714
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I do like Rocket Raccoon.

715
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's just sort of out of the blue.

716
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So there are some weird choices in there.

717
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
But, you know, it can't all be totally mainstream.

718
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That's kind of part of the fun of it.

719
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So yeah, I've just done some light skirmishes in that.

720
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Very difficult game, too.

721
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The difficulties, even on very easy, it can be a pain in the ass.

722
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Alan was screaming at the TV trying to beat Galacticus, or at least, you know, kinda.

723
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
He doesn't really scream at the TV, but just in his irritated way.

724
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Flick.

725
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah, I know, right?

726
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So yeah, that was Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

727
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I bought a game on Steam that was dirt cheap last week, not during this whole Autumn sale they've been doing.

728
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
But last week, they had a game called Magica on sale for like $2.50, and you could even download the demo.

729
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Or no, you downloaded the full game, and you could just play the full game for free through Sunday.

730
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Like, this is the kind of stuff Steam can let you do.

731
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So I ended up buying the Uber edition for like 9 bucks.

732
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It comes with all the expansions.

733
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I liked Magica. It was cool.

734
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's kinda like it was a dungeon crawler slash puzzler slash...

735
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The big thing about Magica is that you mix and match these different spell types.

736
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Like you have fire, ice, earth, lightning, arcane, life.

737
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And you can mix the different types to create these, you know, either energy bolts or like...

738
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
One thing you could do, you mix shield with life, and you get like life grenades that you put in the ground.

739
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And when you step on them, they bloom health.

740
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Or you could mix shield with fire, and you get like actual grenades.

741
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So it's interesting kind of learning about the combinations.

742
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So exploration definitely plays heavy into this.

743
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
This is the game as well, and I know we talked about this on the show a while back, but it had some very strange expansions.

744
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Like the first expansion for Magica is Magica Vietnam.

745
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And it's the little magic characters in Vietnam.

746
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And the joke is because all the shooter games end up having a Vietnam expansion.

747
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So Magica got a Vietnam expansion.

748
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
There's a lot of very tongue-in-cheekness.

749
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The game is very tongue-in-cheek. It's sharp-witted.

750
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I think it was right after they announced the Battlefield Bad Company 2, like, Vietnam expansion.

751
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So, yeah. And then they did some other expansions after that.

752
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So, yeah. I enjoyed Magica, and it was fun to play.

753
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You can play it online, too. Like, Alan and I were doing co-op in the same room over Steam online.

754
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It was pretty fun. So you can play like I think up to four or six people at once.

755
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And there's all these other modes I haven't even touched yet, because, again, other games have distracted me.

756
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But there's like, you know, challenge modes, and PvP I guess is a big element.

757
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Because I got the Uber edition, I got all these different Magica types.

758
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And what's funny is that one of them is like a Tron dude.

759
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
They all wear the little hooded robe things. They look like little monks.

760
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But this particular monk has the energy lines and carries an energy disc, right?

761
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And I played that when I was playing online with Alan. He couldn't heal me.

762
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And we couldn't figure it out. Like, why the hell can't you heal me? I can heal you, but you can't heal me.

763
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Well, it's because since I was playing as Tron dude, you don't heal me with life.

764
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You heal me with lightning. So whenever he would shoot a lightning bolt at me, I would heal.

765
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So just funny little quirks like that were in the game and kind of lead to the puzzle elements of Magica.

766
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So, yeah, let's see. Other games I've been playing this week.

767
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Okay, here's a game I've been playing a lot of. A lot of this game.

768
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And I really, I don't know why. When I tell you what game it is, you're going to be like,

769
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
What? Out of everything out right now, you're playing that?

770
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So we went to Evil G one day because we had a gift card we had to spend.

771
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So we found a game that was the perfect amount of money and it was White Knight Chronicles 2.

772
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I was there.

773
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It was on sale. Yeah, you were there. You did come with us.

774
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
White Knight Chronicles 2 we bought on sale for 40 bucks.

775
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And it comes complete with the first game, which I did play a little bit before when it was actually done by Sony.

776
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But now this game has been out in Japan and Europe for a while.

777
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:15,000
But D3 finally put it out here because I guess the first game didn't do so hot, but it has a real cult following to it.

778
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So now the second game's out. It's a lot like the.hack games on PS2.

779
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You can play the first game all over. Well, actually, you couldn't even do this in the.hack games because they didn't come with each game.

780
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
But imagine if like the first.hack, what?.hack infection and the next one.

781
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Like imagine if they were bundled together. You can either start the first game, which is what they called the remastered version,

782
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:45,000
although I call it the they made the annoying text box slightly less annoying and a couple other little things you probably won't notice.

783
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Or you could just start the second game at level 35.

784
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But I'm like, well, I'm going to go back and play the first game.

785
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So I've been playing the first game and I've already played it longer, much longer than I did the last time.

786
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
My characters are up to like level 19 or 20 at this point. And I just I keep doing side quests.

787
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I've got pulled into there's so much different types of micromanaging you can do that I think people don't even know about this game.

788
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Like you can build a whole little town and depending on the villagers that you recruit, you earn different products that are in this town.

789
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
There's a whole online mode in this game that feels a lot like Phantasy Star to me.

790
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You team up with other people to do quests and you can do them online.

791
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But here's the thing, despite the fact that I say all this and I mentioned I've been playing this game for a lot,

792
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
although it lets you do these things, it does none of them remarkably well.

793
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Like it's not a bad game, but it's just a it does a lot of things, but none of them are best in class.

794
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
But it's like a game to get straight B's across the board.

795
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
None of the like the story is not really an A. The graphics are pretty good.

796
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The music's good, but it's not great. The character design, it's neat, but there's a lot of repetition.

797
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So it could be it's like it gets straight B's. But he put it all together and it makes for a really deep experience.

798
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's like Xanadu.

799
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I guess. I don't know. But yeah, I can't stop playing. I'm just like grind, grind, grind, grind.

800
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I could be playing Skyrim, yet I'm playing this game because it's like I have to beat story mode.

801
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I have to get to level. I have to get to the White Knight Chronicles 2.

802
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I have to be able to play with people online. I can't stop playing.

803
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Couple other negatives I'll say about the game.

804
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Really disappointed that there was an online store mode where you buy things for your village like houses and scenery.

805
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:43,000
But this stuff will impact the amount of stuff that you can grow, which in turn is what's for sale at your stores.

806
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So that's my long way of saying you can buy your way to a competitive edge in this game.

807
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And it's not just that, but they actually sell items at the Sony store that are like this coupon is good for 20% increased experience for one week.

808
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So there's a lot of like really cheap stuff like that. And I almost want to flunk the game on those grounds alone.

809
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:14,000
However, I do have to realize there is this online component that they're not charging money for that does have about the depth of Phantasy Star Universe.

810
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And Phantasy Star Universe does still charge money to this day. Why they just don't go free to play, I don't know.

811
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So I give it a slight pass on those grounds because I feel like, okay, well, fair enough.

812
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
They are providing a robust online component. They got to make the money for that somewhere, I guess.

813
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But I do frown on the fact that they sell things to give you a competitive edge. That shit is just...

814
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
As a gamer, it bothers me. I don't like it in other games too.

815
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Let's see, actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangelsonshooty.com says,

816
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Wait, White Knot Chronicles 2 has both games? I'm going to tell a friend that wants it to get that instead of the first one.

817
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Oh, absolutely. The first game is pointless at this point. Like, if you can get it 10 bucks used, awesome.

818
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And you can import what you do in the first game into the second game. You can do that.

819
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You don't have to just start at level 35 because the level cap in the first game was 50.

820
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So you grind your way to 50 and then do it that way.

821
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Yeah, there's really no point. And this game is probably not that expensive.

822
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
White Knot Chronicles 2 is 40 bucks on sale. But that was a pre-Black Friday type sale.

823
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
When did we go to Evil G, Dark Sakura? Was that Wednesday?

824
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I think so, yeah.

825
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
You can probably find it used even cheaper somewhere else.

826
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Maybe. But be careful because it has an online pass called GeoNet. So you can't do any of the online features without the...

827
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You get the one free with the new copy and then it's going to be $10 otherwise.

828
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It was Sunday. Sunday morning.

829
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
That's right, because the show didn't happen.

830
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah. But we went in the morning because I was running away from the football game.

831
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah, yeah. So anyway, White Knot Chronicles 2. Straight Bs, yet I can't stop playing it. Go figure.

832
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And then here's a game that I've also been playing a lot of. And it's Super Mario 3DS.

833
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And I gotta say, I'm just going to be blunt, this is my favorite Mario game in the past 20 years, I think. For real.

834
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I think this is my favorite Mario game since Super Mario World, I think.

835
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,000
It's great. If you own a 3DS, I don't know why you would not get this game.

836
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I seriously do not know why you would be a Nintendo supporter and not want Mario 3D Land.

837
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It is outstanding. The level design is fantastic.

838
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,000
There's a lot of throwbacks to a lot of things you see in the Mario series, as well as some new stuff like the whole Boomerang Mario.

839
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But yeah, I can't stop thinking about the level design. The level design is so good.

840
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:58,000
They're linear levels, like what you would see in a Mario game, yet they have that slight openness of like Mario 64, yet they're not too damn open.

841
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Like I think some of the levels in that game and even like Galaxy and Sunshine were.

842
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Like there definitely is that Mario linear path to it. And I don't think that's a bad thing at all.

843
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
There's just a lot of fun things that you find in different levels.

844
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Like some of them are the automatic scrolling levels. Some of them are like the donuts. Some of them are the blocks that spin.

845
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The ghost houses are back. The desert levels are there. I mean, it's all there.

846
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And from what I understand, the game, you can play through it twice because you have Mario 3D.

847
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Believe it or not, it's neat. I was not the biggest fan of Mario 64, and I've taken shit for that on this show over the years.

848
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And a lot of that was because I didn't like the transition from 2D to 3D.

849
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Like, you know, Mario 64 was one of the first big 3D games, and I realize a lot of people disagree with me on that, and that's fine.

850
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Every gamer gets their own opinion. So I was a little worried about this at first.

851
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:02,000
But I think because the levels still feel somewhat linear-esque to me, but still have a sense of openness to them, I'm not bothered by the 3D at all.

852
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And the actual 3D effects are cool, and they're with purpose in some places.

853
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And, like, there's some kind of puzzle rooms, for lack of a better term, that you actually kind of use 3D in.

854
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Can you play it in 2D? Yes. Would it look as good? No, it doesn't look as good.

855
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So you think they've really got the hang of the 3D now?

856
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I do, and I'll tell you one thing I love, love, and I think all the 3DS games need to do this, is they have a switch now that not only can you adjust the intensity of the 3D,

857
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:46,000
but with the switch of the D-pad, if you press the up arrow, then the 3D is up, like it's outward 3D, whereas if you hit the down arrow, it's inward 3D.

858
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
That's cool. That may not make a lot of sense the way I'm saying it, but when you play it, you'll see what I mean.

859
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It's instead of, one will project, the other will immerse.

860
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yes, and this can help some of the effects, like depending on your eyes, like sometimes I notice if I'm playing the projector 3D,

861
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:13,000
there's these stages where these spiked ball things will kind of swing back and forth, like out.

862
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Well, sometimes the 3DS does this thing where when they swing forth, your vision starts to split.

863
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Get the ghosting.

864
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah, you see the ghosting and all that, but if you do the inward 3D, I don't see that at all.

865
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:31,000
That's probably how I would have to play the whole thing, given that every other thing I've played on a 3DS, I get the problem all the time.

866
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
You can kind of choose what 3D works for you.

867
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So, let's see, go into our chatroom at chat.orangelaundryday.com and looking at some comments here.

868
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
DDRDollarBill says, please tell me it's not like Mario 64. It's not like Mario 64.

869
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
In my opinion, it's better, and there's going to be a lot of people that disagree with me on that, and that's fine.

870
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Let's see, SGA100Matt says, Rob, you're not the only person I've heard say this.

871
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Let's see, Actf says, I liked Super Mario 64, but I get why people don't like it.

872
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Heck, my favorite Mario game is still Super Mario World.

873
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Mine too. Mario 3D Land is not without flaw.

874
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
For instance, the StreetPass stuff is weird.

875
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Like, you have these mystery boxes that are very similar to the Toad Houses, where if you can clear a mystery box in like 10 or 15 seconds, you might get a chance at a bonus coin.

876
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And I guess the deal with is that if you StreetPass with people, all it does is it's like they give you a new mystery box.

877
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And it's not necessarily one that they've played, or I don't think it really is anything but, hey, you got a little bonus because you StreetPassed with someone.

878
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So that's kind of a little like, boy, that seems somewhat forced.

879
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So to that, I say derp derp, but it doesn't really detract from the single-player game experience, which is still great.

880
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I mean, StreetPassing will allow you to get more bonus coins, I think, which will allow you to get some of the levels and stuff.

881
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But if you're really good at single-player, you could still do it.

882
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
You know, bro, one week from today, Mario Kart 7.

883
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I know. See, there's been a lot of skepticism about the 3DS, and rightfully so.

884
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Because this game blows any of the launch titles out of the fucking water, including Street Fighter IV.

885
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Yeah, they launched with this?

886
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
They should have launched with this.

887
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Now, maybe there's a method to the madness, maybe they didn't want to have the sell-outs, which would seem weird for Nintendo,

888
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
but maybe they wanted to launch it early and have this slow build, I don't know.

889
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Or maybe they legitimately thought it would launch heavier than it did.

890
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
But if this game can't sell the 3DS, nothing will.

891
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's as simple as that.

892
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:57,000
If the 3DS, if this game does not carry 3DS sales, there really is nothing else they can put out on it.

893
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I truly believe that.

894
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
This Mario game is about as good as the Nintendo game gets.

895
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It's better than Galaxy.

896
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It's better than New Super Mario Bros. Wii. I really think so.

897
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Is it better than Sunshine? Because Sunshine was pretty epic.

898
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yes, it's better than Sunshine.

899
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And some people think Sunshine was ass.

900
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I think it was a lot better than... I don't get how you can like Mario 64 and hate Sunshine,

901
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
but I guess it has to do with the whole water element, but whatever.

902
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I actually like 64 a whole lot.

903
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I like 64, but I don't think it's... I like this game better. I really do.

904
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
This is going to be one of the best games of the year, period.

905
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
This is a great year for games.

906
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I'm seriously sitting back going, how can I choose between Mario 3D Land, Portal 2, and Skyrim,

907
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
which one of these games is the best game of the year, because they are all fucking good.

908
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Like, really fucking good.

909
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And there's some games I haven't even touched yet.

910
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I'm hearing amazing things about Zelda Skyward Sword, which I'm sure a lot of us are.

911
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I don't think any of us in the room, oddly enough, have touched that yet,

912
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
but I'm hoping to get my hands on it before the end of the year.

913
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
There's a lot I still haven't played.

914
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
This has been a great year for games. It really has.

915
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Thankfully, as far as releases go, aside from Mario Kart 7,

916
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
there's no real big major releases in games until the end of January.

917
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So you got a few weeks to catch up on some stuff, at least.

918
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
SalaciousPop in our chat room says,

919
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Sunshine was pretty terrible, to be honest, but I also hated 64.

920
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I didn't see his thoughts on this one, but I can tell you, since we're playing on the same cartridge,

921
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
he's been playing quite a bit.

922
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
He's about as far in the game as I am, so I'm thinking he's liking this one.

923
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So I'm hearing there's a lot of stuff.

924
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I don't want to spoil things more than I probably already have,

925
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
but I hear there's a lot of stuff you can kind of unlock if you do really well on a lot of the levels,

926
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
and I think that's great. It kind of gives the game some value.

927
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And obviously, there's the coins that you can go back and get and so forth.

928
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But I get the sense that unlike 64, where you had to play the same level over and over to get the stars and all that,

929
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
if you don't get a single coin in the damn game, I think you can still beat it.

930
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I think you can still fight Bowser and beat the game, but you will miss ten bonus levels.

931
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
You'll miss the chance to unlock the extra game.

932
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I think there's a lot to build for.

933
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Anyhow, yeah, good gaming week.

934
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And I still have to play more Skyrim, I really do.

935
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And after the Civilization sale on Steam the other day, I was like,

936
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
we need to have another Civ night.

937
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
So anyway, it's a great time to be a gamer. It really is.

938
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Well, I have one more little thing.

939
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Sure. What do you want to throw out there before we get into some gaming news?

940
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Well, when you were talking about Umlaut, I forgot to mention that I designed the badges and tickets this year.

941
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So everyone needs to go and hold on to my work forever.

942
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
So your graphic design chatter on this show is not for naught,

943
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
because now your stuff is actually going to be a part of this gaming event. That's really cool.

944
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And no, you don't get to preview everyone. I can't show anybody.

945
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Yeah, you have to go to the event and find out.

946
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Rob's seen it though.

947
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Well, I can't say anything about it. Go to the show and find out.

948
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You can tell them it looks good.

949
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yes, it looks very professional. It does. It looks very professional.

950
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I don't know how much I can and can't say on air, but I will just say,

951
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,000
understanding the source material, you did a really good job making everything consistent.

952
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And kind of putting your own spin on it. So I think that's awesome.

953
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
That was the goal. Branding was the big thing.

954
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It was actually really fun to do. Probably one of the fastest I've ever gotten anything accomplished.

955
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:03,000
But yeah, so for people who actually can't make it, they'll be up on my portfolio after the event's over.

956
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I'm supposed to be doing something as well, but I don't think I'm at liberty to say yet.

957
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I haven't seen – once the official word is out there, I'll be able to say something.

958
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So that's all I can say. But I really hope you're going this year.

959
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Everyone be there.

960
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you really should go to them loud.

961
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Fly out.

962
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Join us.

963
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,000
All right. Quick housekeeping. Follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

964
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

965
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And hey, we're now on Google+.

966
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
That happened, the show we weren't at last week, but we are now on Google+, as well.

967
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Unfortunately, Google did not smarten up and let you have a custom URL,

968
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
but it's really easy to find us on there just in your little Google Plus search box.

969
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Look for Orange Lounge Radio, and it'll probably pop up by the time you get Orange and L in there.

970
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
So keep an eye out for that and plus one S and all that stuff on Google+.

971
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
All right. Let's get into some gaming news.

972
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
We're like, what, an hour into the show with all the games that we played this week?

973
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Let's actually get into some gaming news.

974
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It's actually a good thing we spent an hour talking about gaming weeks

975
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
because our show is a little bit abbreviated this week because of the website problems.

976
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
We don't have quite as much news as usual.

977
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And it is also a slow news week because it's been a big holiday here in the States.

978
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
There's a few big stories we're going to get to here.

979
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I will say also though, look forward to this, in Part B tonight,

980
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
listless returns in Part B tonight.

981
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
We love to fill slow news weeks with OLR games.

982
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So listless coming up tonight in Part B. Okay, sorry, Loki, your turn.

983
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Okay. So Sony is reporting that the PlayStation Move has shipped 9 million units,

984
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
and a million of those have been over the past half year.

985
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Of course, there's a lot of funky math when you go to look at this.

986
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
One, it's unit shipped, not necessarily sold.

987
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And two, unlike you can't compare this to the Kinect, where Kinect is a solid unit

988
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
and that's all you need to use the Kinect, the Move has multiple components.

989
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So you can have up to four Move controllers per system.

990
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And I'm not even sure if they're counting the navigation controllers

991
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
or whatever else to go along with that.

992
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
So who knows what that necessarily means?

993
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
9 million Move units shipped, I don't know.

994
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
But hey, it's not bad.

995
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I mean, 9 million is a good number, even if it is four per system.

996
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
All right.

997
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I mean, I don't know. It's just doing better than I thought it was.

998
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Not bad.

999
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Ours is hooked up now. I haven't played it yet.

1000
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I still have the Move controllers, but I actually have no Move.

1001
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Well, aside from LittleBigPlanet 2 obviously supports it,

1002
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
but I don't have any Move required games yet.

1003
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
But I don't really play my PlayStation 3 that much either.

1004
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
That's why I loan out all my PlayStation 3 games.

1005
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
That's funny because I've been buying most of my stuff on PS3 lately,

1006
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
and a lot of it comes down to the controller.

1007
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
It really does.

1008
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
But if it's online, with the exception of White Knight Chronicles,

1009
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
which is only a Sony game, if it's online, I usually go for Xbox.

1010
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
If I play multiplayer, it's live.

1011
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Well, you know what I'm going to be playing a lot of in the next few days?

1012
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Sega Saturn!

1013
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Why?

1014
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Christmas nights.

1015
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Oh, that's right. I forgot. That's like your yearly little thing.

1016
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Your fun thing.

1017
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
All right.

1018
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Well, as far as the Move goes, though, do you think the Move is a wash at this point,

1019
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
or do you think they're still going to try and breathe some life into it?

1020
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I think that there's still plenty of life to be brought into it,

1021
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:54,000
because after all, they support it in most of their first-party games.

1022
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Like Resistance and Killzone and SOCOM all support the Move,

1023
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:07,000
and plus they have a lot of games coming out that are going to be supporting it that are pretty big.

1024
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Like Bioshock Infinite is going to be supporting the Move.

1025
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So I think that they do have a good grasp on how to use the Move with hardcore games, per se.

1026
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Better than the Kinect, that's for sure.

1027
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I'll give Sony props for that, because the way that they've done Kinect support for the hardcore games,

1028
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
if you will, like Halo and Forza 4, it sucks.

1029
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
It's terrible.

1030
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I mean, head tracking sounds like a good idea.

1031
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Not implemented very well at all.

1032
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And voice commands in Halo, no.

1033
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It's stupid.

1034
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
It's absolutely terrible.

1035
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Do you think it's because the Kinect didn't end up being, hardware-wise, what it should have been?

1036
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Like it should have been a better camera in there?

1037
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I don't even know if that's the case.

1038
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I mean, really, if that is the problem, couldn't they revise the hardware?

1039
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Well, I guess they could separate the user base.

1040
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Wait for the next Xbox at this point.

1041
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
But, I mean, I don't know. I guess it could have been better, but...

1042
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Alright.

1043
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Well, moving on to another story.

1044
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
This was something that had a lot of chatter going on, especially the week that we were off last week,

1045
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
but it's kind of been continuing on this week.

1046
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And that's about this new act that's in Congress, and it's called SOPA.

1047
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Not soap. SOPA, which is S-O-P-A, it's short for Stop Online Piracy Act.

1048
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Now, I'm sure most of you in the gaming community have probably heard about this act already.

1049
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
If you're not aware, basically there is an act that's being explored.

1050
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It hasn't passed yet, but it's one of those things that's going through the committees,

1051
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
which means it likely could go for a vote, you know, even before, possibly,

1052
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Congress takes a break for the holidays coming up in December.

1053
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And, in short, the Stop Online Piracy Act will allow the government to force internet service providers

1054
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:00,000
to basically blacklist websites, make it unable to access websites, domain names,

1055
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
based on the fact if they are offering infringing material or not.

1056
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
You know, what they're trying to stop is they basically want to shut down things like the Pirate Bay.

1057
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Like, that'll be one of the first things that gets thrown up there is that they'll block that domain

1058
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:21,000
so that you can no longer pirate, if you've been using that site, you know, videos and movies and so forth and so on.

1059
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:29,000
But this is causing a lot of controversy, and the fact is it's kind of like how they are censoring things.

1060
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And, well, A, a lot of people are saying straight up when you talk censorship of the internet,

1061
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
it's like, dude, this isn't China. Why are we censoring the internet?

1062
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Blocking websites, that's a China thing. That's what they do there. Why are we doing this?

1063
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And, you know, obviously what they're trying to do is stop piracy,

1064
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
but unfortunately, you know, this act, I feel, kind of leaves it very vague,

1065
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:00,000
because my understanding is that if a company were to complain that this website is offering infringing material,

1066
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
that website could just get shut down. Oh, hold on a minute.

1067
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
We have something here in this country called Due Process.

1068
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Well, actually, I believe they do. It's not as simple as, you know, they complain about it.

1069
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It does actually have to go in front of a judge to say, okay, here's our evidence that this site's doing that.

1070
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:26,000
But it's not just sites that have pirated material. It's sites that they claim facilitate finding that.

1071
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
So, like, Google, for example.

1072
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Pfizer's behind this because it's also targeting websites that sell, like, fake Viagra.

1073
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Pfizer's the drug company that created Viagra.

1074
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And, you know, how much spam mail do we get every day about go to this Canadian pharmacy website that sells Viagra or whatever it is?

1075
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Yeah, but we're still going to get that spam. I mean, that's not going to go away.

1076
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Oh, God, if it was going to get rid of the spam, that would be awesome, but no.

1077
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
There's a couple ways. Oh, and why? I didn't even really get to the story. I was giving the background on this.

1078
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
A lot of gaming companies have come out actually in support of this.

1079
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Like, Nintendo's in support of it. I believe Microsoft finally came out.

1080
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
At first they weren't. Now they are. Sony's in support of it. A lot of the game companies.

1081
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Hollywood loves it. Hollywood wants this.

1082
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Hollywood's the one, yeah, trying to push this through.

1083
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Hollywood's trying to push it through.

1084
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Somebody finally came out this week against it.

1085
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And it's, like, of course the EFF's against it and all that, but it's the Business Software Alliance, the BSA, came out against this.

1086
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Even though originally they commended the idea, the BSA, or the Business Software Alliance, the CEO of them,

1087
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Robert Holliman, put in a blog post that they do not support the bill as it is because SOPA needs to, quote,

1088
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:46,000
balance key innovation, privacy, and security considerations with the need to thwart the threat rogue websites pose.

1089
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Also, quote, definitions of who can be the subject of legal actions and what remedies are imposed must be tightened and narrowed.

1090
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Due process, free speech, and privacy are rights cannot be compromised.

1091
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
BSA has long stood against filtering or monitoring the internet.

1092
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And I totally agree with this guy, is that I understand if they want to do something about piracy and the fake drugs,

1093
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
everything that spam targets, I'm all for you trying to clean that shit up off the internet.

1094
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:27,000
But where do you draw the line? You know, because filtering the internet, that's not what we do here.

1095
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:34,000
You know what I mean? Like, I'm really torn, because whereas I'm like, okay, if they want to stop piracy, they have a right to stop piracy.

1096
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Well, they can't really stop piracy. What they're doing is just blocking access to these sites,

1097
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
because these sites operate in countries that don't have the same piracy laws as we do.

1098
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So really, as far as jurisdiction goes in the US, there's nothing they can do about it other than block them. That's it.

1099
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And what's great about this act, and you can obviously tell that the person that drafted this really knows their internet,

1100
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:05,000
it only blocks domain names. You know what domain names are, right? They're just basically easy ways for you to remember an IP address.

1101
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:13,000
It's your cell phone book. Like, seriously, in this day and age, how many people actually have all the numbers in their cell phone book memorized?

1102
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Very few. You might know your parents, you might know your significant other, but that's about it.

1103
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I don't know my significant other's phone number. I don't.

1104
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
And here's the thing, though.

1105
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
That's okay, I don't know your significant phone number either.

1106
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
It's in my phone.

1107
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Okay, there's a bunch of things that they're assuming to be true. First off, these websites or whatever,

1108
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,000
obviously if they feel that they're going to be threatened or taken down or whatever, they're just going to give you the IP address.

1109
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
You type in the IP address, boom, you're at the website. It's not blocked.

1110
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Two, they're assuming that you're using the DNS server that's provided to you by your internet provider.

1111
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,000
But guess what? You can also forward that to a different DNS server that can be run by anybody, even yourself.

1112
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I think at the end of the day, you have to hold these websites responsible and that's the only way to stop the problem.

1113
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
It's not that easy because they're not all in America.

1114
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Here's the problem, though. Much like piracy and stuff, they're going to try all these things to try to stop piracy,

1115
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,000
but all it's going to do is hurt other people and not necessarily get rid of the piracy problem.

1116
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
The problem is just like everything else with piracy, just like we've seen time and time again,

1117
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
every time they've tried to do something such as, let's say, Ubisoft DRM, right?

1118
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
You're not connected to the internet, the game shuts down. Pirates had it cracked in two days.

1119
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Who did that shit ultimately hurt? The legitimate users.

1120
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And that's going to be the problem with SOPA, is that the pirates will find their way around it in two days.

1121
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Who's going to ultimately get hurt? The legitimate users who are trying to access a website like AllGames.com

1122
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
who suddenly got yanked because, I don't know, fucking Namco or somebody didn't like

1123
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
that they were playing the music from a 25-year-old video game or something, you know?

1124
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Like, legitimate people are going to end up getting hurt. That's the problem.

1125
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And if it's anything like, you know, I've read kind of these horror stories about some file sharing sites

1126
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:12,000
where Warner Brothers, they were sending cease and desist basically for files that weren't even their properties.

1127
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It just happened to have, like, names of their stuff. Part of the title was sharing their names.

1128
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I called my hard drive Batman, so Warner Brothers wants to shut me down.

1129
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
You know, something like that. Or like, you know, even like YouTube.

1130
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Well, YouTube videos now, I mean, obviously, they can pull it if there's a complaint or something like that.

1131
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:40,000
But it's just going to be really hard for them to do it, and I just have a feeling that even if this law passes,

1132
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I don't think it's going to do anything. Did those, like, what was it? The digital...

1133
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I don't even remember what the hell is.

1134
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
The millennium... Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1135
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Yeah, basically the DVD copying thing. Did that stop people from copying DVDs?

1136
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Nope. Nothing. So people find a way around it, and it's just, it's unfortunate.

1137
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
If you don't like the direction these folks are heading in, it's time to vote them out.

1138
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Because, you know, I admit, I'm sitting here going, I understand where this might be an issue or whatever,

1139
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
but I can think of a lot of things that are a bigger issue right now, and that is like, you know,

1140
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I don't know, the fact that the whole country is going down the shitter, and people are very upset about that.

1141
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
You know, the whole thing. And I get the...

1142
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Watch out, Rob, you might get pepper sprayed, and then locked into a detainment camp.

1143
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We do live just down the street from UC Davis, you know. Not literally down the street,

1144
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
but we're not that far away, all things considered.

1145
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
You know, we used to joke on the... Isn't it a long-running joke on this show?

1146
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
The People's Republic of Davis, abandon all hope, you enter here, and look at what fucking happened!

1147
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And you all can see it. But anyway, anyway, outside of that joke, yeah, obviously,

1148
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I do get the element, though, that Hollywood is pissed because piracy is hurting their industry.

1149
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Because it is.

1150
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:06,000
But I think to an extent, there's two things hurting that industry.

1151
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
You could say that piracy is one, but the other thing that's hurting them is their failure to adapt,

1152
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
is killing traditional broadcast networks.

1153
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Well, their way of adapting is, well, we're just gonna reduce the amount of options that you have.

1154
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And actually, the stuff that they're doing on the retail side of things is hurting them.

1155
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Like, for example, there's the 28-day windows, which will soon enough be 60-day windows

1156
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
as soon as those contracts are up next year.

1157
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:40,000
60-day windows for movies being in Redbox and also on Netflix.

1158
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And also, Warner Brothers started...

1159
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:52,000
All rental customers are not able to get stuff from distribution and stuff until 60 days after the fact.

1160
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Including, which is great, one of the first titles to do this, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2.

1161
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Just two weeks after that window is up, they're pulling Harry Potter out of circulation.

1162
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
All of them. Gone. Out of circulation.

1163
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Because you have to buy it now. Because you have to.

1164
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Because it's going out of circulation so they can re-release it later on in a special Uber edition or something.

1165
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
But the fact that there's not rental options for the...

1166
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I mean, not that there really is rental options because any rental store can go to the store and go buy it.

1167
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
But it's limited because, you know...

1168
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And when you can't find it, you're like, shit, I'll just download it.

1169
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Yeah. And it's pretty easy to download stuff.

1170
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
And unfortunately, those customers would have rented it.

1171
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Hey, maybe you might have liked it and went and bought it.

1172
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
And still, there may be people that download a really crappy copy and they're like,

1173
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
hey, you know what, that movie's pretty good. I'm gonna go buy it.

1174
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
But it just kind of leaves a sour taste in people's mouths.

1175
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Especially with all the fucking tons of re-releases or remakes or movies based on board games or stupid shit that we don't...

1176
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Who's had an original idea in the last 50 years?

1177
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Yeah, there's not a lot of original ideas out there.

1178
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Lots of chatter in our chat room about this tonight.

1179
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Again, it's Channel Orange Lounge on the Game Surge Network.

1180
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Let me read a few comments here.

1181
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Game Guru says, I think everyone needs to be voted out, start from scratch.

1182
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Frisbee says, Hollywood is irrelevant to entertainment anymore.

1183
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Very interesting quote.

1184
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Very interesting and very true, I think, in many ways because the whole...

1185
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Well, look at what we're doing here.

1186
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
We're doing a radio program.

1187
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
We're doing a podcast that people can listen to in their car without having to ever turn on the radio.

1188
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
What about web shows like The Guild, for example?

1189
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Or viral videos, you know?

1190
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
People at this point would rather watch...

1191
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:54,000
They would rather watch cute kitty laughing and giggling videos or the dog that sounds like he's really saying, I love you, than watching Whitney.

1192
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
There's a lot more...

1193
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Oh, God. That show is terrible.

1194
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:05,000
There's a lot more entertainment options out there than there were, say, 30 years ago, whatever.

1195
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Before when it was just like, okay, you've got radio, you've got movies, and you have TV.

1196
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
That's it.

1197
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
You can read a newspaper or a funny book or something like that, but now it's just the internet.

1198
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
The internet's just got tons of content.

1199
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Anything you're looking for, it's just right there.

1200
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:27,000
That's why these TV shows, if it's a very mediocre TV show, no one gives a fuck.

1201
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
No one's going to watch that.

1202
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Like Whitney, it was terrible.

1203
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
It just happens to come on sometimes after the office is done.

1204
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I'm like, ah! Horrible show! Off with you!

1205
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I just want to sort of, I guess, kind of reign things back.

1206
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Everyone pay attention who you vote for.

1207
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Don't vote a party ticket, because that's also just as dangerous.

1208
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Because that's how assholes get snuck into government positions.

1209
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Stop and take an effort to read who supports what.

1210
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Get a take home ballot, or an absentee ballot, that's how I vote every year.

1211
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Do your homework!

1212
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Exactly.

1213
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And then double check every box that you mark right before you mark it.

1214
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That's the advantage of taking one of those home.

1215
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
You have time to research, you list out the pros and cons,

1216
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
but the biggest thing is actually put some damn effort into your future.

1217
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I mean, how many people do you know just don't vote because, oh, I don't care?

1218
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Or, oh, it's too much work for me to go and mark some check boxes or read up on this stuff.

1219
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Oh, it's too much work.

1220
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Or, I'm going to buy this product because it's cheap and I don't care if they outsource all of their customer service.

1221
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You know, that's why it's cheap.

1222
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Think about what you do before you fucking do it.

1223
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And put effort into your life.

1224
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Well, did Dan just laugh from the other room?

1225
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Yeah, because he's mad at me because I don't have a job yet.

1226
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
You're expressing yourself in other ways.

1227
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I'd like to express myself at a job. Someone hire me too while you're at it.

1228
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Well, you did get, I mean, you might not be getting paid for it,

1229
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
but you at least have the fuzzy wuzzy, I contributed to a good cause.

1230
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Addendum. I want a job that will pay me too.

1231
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
But you don't mind the charity work at all either.

1232
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I don't mind the charity work, but you don't know how many.

1233
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Uh oh.

1234
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,000
You're stealing my shit list for the Warcraft thing.

1235
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I'm getting yelled at by Dan.

1236
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And if somebody out there could donate self-defense classes, I'd really appreciate that.

1237
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
No, that's really besides the point.

1238
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It's when you've got it on a mass scale, that's when we see a problem.

1239
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
It's one little action done by thousands of people can make a difference.

1240
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
You know, if you really want to make a point for Dan, you know what job you should get?

1241
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
You should run for Congress.

1242
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Fuck no.

1243
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Dan says, hell yeah, then we could be corrupt and rich.

1244
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
No. No.

1245
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Awesome. There you go, Dan.

1246
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I am not going to live a life that I find morally objectionable.

1247
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I bet you could get like 10 votes from OLR listeners.

1248
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
All right.

1249
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Moving on.

1250
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
All right.

1251
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
In all seriousness.

1252
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Can I do my story now?

1253
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Yes, you may do your story now.

1254
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
We need fuzzy wuzzy happy news.

1255
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
How about indie game music bundle?

1256
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Yay.

1257
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
10 albums for a dollar.

1258
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:45,000
The, um, there's now the indie game music bundle, which is like the humble indie bundle,

1259
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:53,000
but you get 10 items for a dollar, um, including, um, stuff from Super Meat Boy and VVVVVVV Minecraft.

1260
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Um, that's, uh, Minecraft Volume Alpha, uh, Cobalt EP, Super Meat Boy Digital Special Edition Soundtrack,

1261
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Imposter Nostalgia, Raven Mark Scourge of Astellion, Ares Extinction Agenda, Return All Robots,

1262
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Mighty Milky Way, Mighty Flip Channel, uh, Champ, sorry.

1263
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
PPPPPPP, the VVVVVVV, OST, and Tree of Knowledge.

1264
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
You said PP.

1265
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:25,000
And, um, if you can, uh, contribute more than $10, you also get Wind Up Night, Binding of Isaac, 72 Minutes of Fame,

1266
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Milk Snake, Anti-Gravity Extreme Road Trip, and Contingency.

1267
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Okay, seriously?

1268
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:39,000
For just the Super Meat Boy and VVVVV or what, PPVVVV, whatever soundtracks, is like worth that whole dollar like 20 times over?

1269
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
You know how I'd pronounce that?

1270
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Huh.

1271
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
PRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR, the VVVVVV, OST.

1272
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
So.

1273
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
There.

1274
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:54,000
But, uh, yeah, seriously, I'm just not as familiar with some of the other soundtracks, but I'm sure there's a lot of great chiptuney stuff in there, so, um,

1275
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
You really should think about purchasing this. You really, really should think about that.

1276
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
You know, if you have a dollar.

1277
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Don't think so hard you give yourself an aneurysm.

1278
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Yeah, don't do that.

1279
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
All right.

1280
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
But if you do, I'll kinda laugh.

1281
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Uh, Loki.

1282
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,320
All right, so let's see.

1283
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,380
Let's start off with some more cheerful stuff, hopefully.

1284
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:21,480
So basically, there may be a sequel to Command & Conquer

1285
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,720
possibly coming from BioWare.

1286
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:26,240
It was teased during a,

1287
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:32,680
they actually had a real brief video on teasing, I guess.

1288
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,760
There's a Spike Video Games Awards

1289
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,640
right around the corner.

1290
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,520
And then, of course, there's also a screenshot

1291
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,240
that's out there as well, and kind of,

1292
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,840
it's a new BioWare game,

1293
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,600
and they haven't really said what exactly it is,

1294
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,800
but it looks kinda neat.

1295
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,720
Also, there's another studio that's part of the EA,

1296
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,040
I don't know, the ARM, if you will, Victory Games.

1297
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:01,120
They're working on a new strategy title,

1298
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,940
which people are thinking, hmm, maybe that's a cool,

1299
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:06,940
Command & Conquer game, hmm, perhaps.

1300
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:11,320
Also, I guess they have another Medal of Honor thing

1301
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:15,200
working with one of their other studios, Danger Close.

1302
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:20,200
So lots of different studios working under EA.

1303
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,520
Remember, at one point, EA was just buying up,

1304
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,280
not necessarily buying up everybody,

1305
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,520
but publishing everybody.

1306
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:32,520
They have, obviously, the new Respawn Entertainment

1307
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:37,480
from the former execs of Infinity Ward.

1308
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,640
You know, they're making something.

1309
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,620
Obviously, Valve is doing a lot of stuff with them.

1310
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,000
And then, Crytek as well.

1311
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,600
Lots of stuff there.

1312
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,720
But at least the BioWare game,

1313
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,520
now, of course, right now, they don't know if it,

1314
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,600
you know, Command & Conquer is really the game or not,

1315
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,740
or if it's something else.

1316
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:59,940
But the BioWare game is gonna be revealed December 10th

1317
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:01,720
during the Spike Video Game Awards,

1318
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:06,340
and like I said, they had a very, very, very brief trailer

1319
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:08,000
of something with tanks.

1320
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,360
It has tanks in it.

1321
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,720
How do you feel about Command & Conquer

1322
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:11,780
with Dialogue Trees?

1323
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,280
Weren't you a big fan of Command & Conquer?

1324
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,560
I soon remember this.

1325
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,980
I used to be, Red Alert.

1326
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,360
Red Alert was awesome.

1327
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,800
But I haven't played Command & Conquer in a long time.

1328
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,140
In fact, the last one that came out,

1329
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,640
I just didn't really care for.

1330
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,980
Well, it could be good, though,

1331
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,800
if they turned it over to a new studio

1332
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,920
to kind of give it a creative energy reboot,

1333
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,160
that could be a good thing, right?

1334
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,000
Yeah, and I'm not even sure.

1335
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,760
I mean, there's a lot of studios working on stuff.

1336
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,400
It could be BioWare that's doing it.

1337
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,640
I think BioWare's actually gonna be

1338
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,460
a different game altogether.

1339
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:42,300
The thought is, though,

1340
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:46,380
that Victory Games is gonna be doing this,

1341
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:49,480
but I have no idea who the hell Victory Games is.

1342
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,120
So, I guess they're a new strategy studio.

1343
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:56,240
And, you know, strategy games for EA,

1344
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:59,280
I mean, really, there was the Lord of the Rings games

1345
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,920
that they had and Command & Conquer.

1346
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,040
So, since Lord of the Rings is not part of EA anymore,

1347
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,220
I'm gonna go on a limb and say

1348
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:11,500
probably gonna be a Command & Conquer game at some point.

1349
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,720
Or maybe, hey, a new IP, maybe a new IP.

1350
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,920
You never know, that could be two.

1351
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:15,740
That'd be good.

1352
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,120
All right, well, let's move on to another story.

1353
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,840
And this is about a possible answer to Smash Brothers

1354
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,420
that Sony is making.

1355
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:25,920
Now, I should say this.

1356
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,420
I always thought that move game,

1357
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:28,800
what was that called, Move Fighters?

1358
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,260
Or something fighters?

1359
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,220
The one that was on Sony?

1360
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:32,600
I thought that was supposed to be their answer

1361
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,840
to Smash Brothers, but I guess not really.

1362
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:35,680
What, which one?

1363
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:38,280
What the hell's that game that's on Sony move?

1364
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,280
Is it Pocket Fighters?

1365
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,700
No, nothing else.

1366
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,960
I think you're thinking of, like,

1367
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,320
there is a Kung Fu game that was on there.

1368
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,160
Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

1369
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,600
Somebody in chow yell it out.

1370
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,720
I don't remember the original game,

1371
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,880
but the one that they have coming to Kinect,

1372
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,400
that's exactly the same as Kung Fu High Impact.

1373
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,940
No, no, I'm not thinking of that, something else.

1374
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:56,000
But anyway, it's fine.

1375
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,040
There apparently is something a little more,

1376
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,960
I don't know if you wanna say mainstream or what,

1377
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,280
but I guess something that's a little more directly,

1378
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,120
I don't wanna say either a Smash Brothers ripoff,

1379
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,500
but something that's supposedly in development.

1380
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:10,440
There's a lot of stuff that's leaking through this blog

1381
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,360
called paulgalenetwork.com.

1382
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,400
I'm not sure this gentleman's relation

1383
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,020
to the gaming industry,

1384
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,760
but a lot of the other gaming blogs

1385
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,080
have picked up and ran with this,

1386
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,560
where Title Fight is apparently the development

1387
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,700
work in progress name of this.

1388
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,840
And some information that's in this,

1389
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,080
it is very similar to Super Smash Brothers.

1390
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,440
It's the special moves and all those attacks,

1391
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,880
you kinda do the same way.

1392
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,940
Apparently there are some characters

1393
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,280
already noticed in this,

1394
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:43,180
and they kinda come in light and heavy flavors,

1395
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:46,120
meaning like who moves slowly, who moves lightly.

1396
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:50,000
Heavier characters include Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal,

1397
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,760
Colonel Male Retic, Fat Princess.

1398
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,040
Some of the lighter characters include Parappa the Rappa,

1399
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,760
that's kinda awesome if he's in a fighting game,

1400
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:01,720
Kratos, Sly Cooper, and Nathan Drake.

1401
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,440
Not sure if there's anything about a story mode

1402
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,160
or anything like that at this time,

1403
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,440
but yeah, I guess some information's

1404
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,560
starting to leak out about this,

1405
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,440
that this could be I guess something you might see

1406
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,280
at next year's E3.

1407
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,240
Well, another interesting thing I heard

1408
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,000
is that there's a commercial right now

1409
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,720
that Sony's running called the Michael Commercial.

1410
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,720
Have you seen this?

1411
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,480
It's floating around where it's like,

1412
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,120
you know, we need Michael, we need Michael,

1413
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,880
and it's like all these Sony characters

1414
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,360
as real life people acting,

1415
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,120
it's actually one of the better Sony commercials in a while,

1416
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,840
but it's all these people as real life Sony characters,

1417
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:37,240
we need Michael, and Michael is the player

1418
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,680
who takes down the controller,

1419
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,000
and it's all like be a part of the game or whatever.

1420
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,560
And some people are saying maybe this is teasing

1421
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:49,440
this whole Sony smorgasbord of characters, this project.

1422
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,360
Cause I could certainly see this as being the big Sony

1423
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,880
reveal of next year's E3,

1424
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:59,200
because now that the Vita will already be out there,

1425
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,800
maybe there's gonna be something about this game

1426
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,560
and how it works between the Vita,

1427
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,160
it could be a Vita title for all we know,

1428
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,560
but how it works between the Vita and the PS3 and all that.

1429
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:11,440
So could be neat, right?

1430
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,320
It could be neat.

1431
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,000
I love the idea of characters like Parappa the Rappa,

1432
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,880
like I kind of forget about how many characters

1433
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,720
Sony really has in their pocket.

1434
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,800
I wonder if he's gonna give you a paper cut.

1435
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,880
He might, it could be something he does,

1436
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:26,880
or Umjama Lamy if she's in it, I'm there, but we'll see.

1437
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:32,960
Milk can, yeah, my guitar is in my mind.

1438
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,440
It would be interesting to see too,

1439
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,400
if they were able to get from some of the other developers,

1440
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,720
you know, kind of like how Smash Brothers had Sonic Snake

1441
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,520
and what was it in the commercial?

1442
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,360
Sonic.

1443
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,400
Sonic, hello, was in the game.

1444
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,320
It would be interesting to see if Sony could get things

1445
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,120
that were very iconically Sony,

1446
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,880
like Cloud from Final Fantasy 7.

1447
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,920
Final Fantasy 7 was a huge Sony thing.

1448
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:54,880
Cause that was when the franchise

1449
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,200
jumped over to PlayStation.

1450
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,600
Could be interesting.

1451
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,960
Could be very interesting.

1452
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,160
All right.

1453
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,360
All right, what are we doing now?

1454
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,880
Moving on to some release dates, right?

1455
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,240
It's traveling around the world

1456
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:10,120
and check out what's coming out to a store this week.

1457
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:13,240
I imagine it's dying down significantly, but let's see.

1458
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,320
Yeah, incredibly dying down.

1459
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,080
A few things.

1460
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,560
There's some cool new combo packs they have

1461
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,280
with controller and game bundles.

1462
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,000
They did this kind of last year.

1463
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,280
And so Sony's got some of those.

1464
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,240
One of them's Uncharted,

1465
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,000
the dual pack with Uncharted one and two,

1466
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,480
and then you get a dual shot controller.

1467
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,440
I believe it's blue.

1468
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,280
And then they have one that's in black

1469
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,280
that comes with the Resistance one and two dual pack.

1470
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:43,800
And there's also one with the God of War Origins collection.

1471
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,760
It's, I believe, red.

1472
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,560
Those are all on PlayStation 3.

1473
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,320
Let's see here.

1474
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,400
Jaws Ultimate Predator on Wii and 3DS.

1475
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,040
Face Racers Photo Finish on 3DS.

1476
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,840
Nano Assault on 3DS.

1477
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,520
But really the only 3DS game you should really care about

1478
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,600
is Mario Kart 7.

1479
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,400
And that's coming out one week from today.

1480
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,600
That's it.

1481
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,320
Oh my God, one week from today?

1482
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,560
That's awesome. One week from today.

1483
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,080
I can't believe it.

1484
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,120
All right.

1485
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:17,280
Well, let's take a look at Japan and what they're getting.

1486
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,480
They're actually getting a little bit more,

1487
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,680
and I think a lot of that is because

1488
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,280
they're getting some of the localized versions

1489
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,880
of stuff that already came out for us.

1490
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,040
In fact, when you look at the Xbox 360 releases

1491
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,080
on December 1st, it looks a lot like that.

1492
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,920
Assassin's Creed Revelations comes out

1493
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,720
as well as Dragon Age Origins gets a reduction.

1494
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:35,640
It's going into the Platinum Collection on Xbox 360.

1495
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,900
Sonic Generations.

1496
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:40,280
Shiro no Jiku is the subtitle for it over there,

1497
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,120
comes out this week,

1498
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,160
as well as King of Fighters XIII makes its way out

1499
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,240
in Japan this week.

1500
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,120
Also one other game on the 360 this week,

1501
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:49,320
a game called Ever17 comes out in regular

1502
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,120
and limited edition flavors.

1503
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,000
I'm not sure what this game is all about.

1504
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,760
It's an adventure game, but I'm noticing it's, you know,

1505
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,720
anime chicks in school girl outfits.

1506
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,480
And in this one clip, I kid you not, I'm looking,

1507
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:04,000
she's holding a hamster and like talking to the hamster.

1508
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,200
So I don't know if she's like the hamster whisperer or what,

1509
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,320
but that's Ever17.

1510
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,640
Is that an anime?

1511
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,480
Maybe it's an anime.

1512
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,840
No, I don't really watch anime anymore.

1513
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:13,680
Rama's in chat.

1514
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:14,960
He'll jump in if that's an anime I'm not aware of.

1515
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,040
Actually, I take that back.

1516
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,520
I've been watching a whole crap load of Evangelion lately.

1517
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,360
Have you really?

1518
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,200
Why that?

1519
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,520
Cause the new series is out, the Rebuild of Evangelion.

1520
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,060
And I've watched the first part already,

1521
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,200
but I started watching some of the second part

1522
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,920
cause they changed quite a bit of the story.

1523
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,080
And then the third one's out.

1524
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:36,080
And so I sat reading the entire Wiki, Evangelion Wiki,

1525
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,600
just like, oh, that's it.

1526
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,040
Okay, cool.

1527
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,120
Going to the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan,

1528
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,720
Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus comes out this week,

1529
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,060
as well as the Sonic Generations

1530
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:46,920
and King of Fighters 13 releases.

1531
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,100
Also on the Sony system this week, Tekken Hybrid.

1532
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:51,680
You know, I saw this at Target.

1533
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,820
We have a version here in America

1534
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:54,320
that I think just came out this week.

1535
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,960
And I had like, Alan picked it up off the shelf

1536
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,400
and was like, I didn't know that this was coming out.

1537
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,520
And I was like, shit, I didn't know about this one either.

1538
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,440
But yeah, this is, what the hell?

1539
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,640
It's like Tag Tournament and?

1540
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,560
It's Tag Tournament HD.

1541
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:13,480
There's a Tag Tournament 2 preview

1542
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,640
and then also Tekken Bowling,

1543
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,240
but I think that's also part of Tag Tournament.

1544
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,880
And it's all in 3D?

1545
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,160
Well, no, it's just those games,

1546
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:29,000
plus it's also the Tekken 3D animated movie

1547
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,880
that just came out as a 3D Blu-ray.

1548
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:32,700
Got it.

1549
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,860
So Hybrid as far as, is both a movie and both a game.

1550
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,920
So like, you can even take that game

1551
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,520
and play it in a regular Blu-ray player

1552
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,280
and you can watch the movie in 3D if you want.

1553
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,680
Or you can just, and what's great though

1554
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:47,840
is remember the new Tekken game that's coming out in 3DS

1555
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,400
will also have that movie in 3D on it,

1556
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,380
which is pretty cool.

1557
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:54,140
Gotta hit up my Namco guy.

1558
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:58,560
All right, just a reminder that the PS Vita

1559
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,720
is three weeks away, December 17th.

1560
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,080
So. In Japan.

1561
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,360
In Japan, not here,

1562
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,240
but I am doing Japanese releases right now.

1563
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,280
That's true.

1564
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:10,800
Sony PSP this week, since that's still the Sony system.

1565
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,880
Only big release is Kamen Rider Climax Heroes 4Z

1566
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:15,720
comes out this week.

1567
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:19,680
That's from Namco Bando and it's an action related title

1568
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:24,180
that looks like kind of a 3D-esque robot fighting game,

1569
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:26,180
kind of like Ultraman style characters

1570
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,160
all fighting in that game.

1571
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:32,120
Lastly, trying to peek ahead to see if the Wii or the,

1572
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,140
that game is coming out on the Wii as well.

1573
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:36,600
Let me look at a 3DS real quick.

1574
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,920
Oh, Mario Kart 7.

1575
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,760
They get it on December 1st in Japan.

1576
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,400
So I'm sure we'll be hearing some early reviews

1577
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,840
from people who imported it.

1578
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,620
Also Sonic Generations coming out on December 1st as well.

1579
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:49,080
Cooking Mama 4 this week on the 3DS.

1580
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,640
And lastly, but not leastly,

1581
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,920
get a load of this title.

1582
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:57,920
Crayon Shin-chan Uchu de Achuu Yuzhou no Oba Karate.

1583
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:01,960
Crayon Shin-chan is old school manga and anime.

1584
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:04,380
Yeah. So, and it's, I love,

1585
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,800
what was the last part of that?

1586
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,240
I love this.

1587
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,520
No, Oba Karate.

1588
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,780
It makes it sound like it's like a karate crayon game.

1589
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:12,120
And it is an action-based game.

1590
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,000
And it's based on that old anime.

1591
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,720
Kind of like a platformer.

1592
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:16,720
Looks a little bit like, you know,

1593
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,720
your Rayman kind of platformer game.

1594
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:23,200
So that's it for releases in Japan.

1595
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,120
For the UK, really not a whole bunch.

1596
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:33,120
We have, on the 30th, Darkstalkers for PlayStation 3.

1597
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,840
Which is kind of cool.

1598
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,440
And then on December 1st, there's Infinity Blade 2.

1599
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:43,040
December 2nd, Ace Combat, Assault Horizon Legacy,

1600
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,360
Assassin's Creed Revelations for PC,

1601
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,320
Mario Kart 7, and Super Pokemon Rumble.

1602
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,160
That's it.

1603
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,480
Just a few more stories for you guys,

1604
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,360
and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

1605
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:55,920
But first, Dark Sakura.

1606
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,320
Well, there have been a lot of pre-orders

1607
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,080
for the Vita in Hong Kong.

1608
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:05,320
Basically, they are the second city

1609
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:09,800
that are getting the system.

1610
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,220
And, well, there's mobbing in online stores

1611
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:16,360
that can't, you know, meet the traffic,

1612
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:20,920
and lots of stuff going on.

1613
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,880
But it's, I guess, not nearly as bad

1614
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,120
as getting pepper sprayed in the face

1615
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:27,200
over a $2 waffle iron.

1616
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,920
But, hey, what this basically means

1617
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,800
is that the early demand is there.

1618
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,120
This could be kind of a big deal.

1619
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:34,960
Yarp.

1620
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,600
It could very well be.

1621
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,520
And I guess that's really all we can say about it for now.

1622
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,280
I know, I was like,

1623
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,200
I haven't had any real reaction out of it,

1624
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,100
just that it's sold.

1625
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:46,260
Maybe people are just too busy

1626
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:47,760
hiding under their desk playing it.

1627
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,260
It's interesting to know if the system's gonna do well,

1628
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:53,120
or if it's gonna fall flat, so we'll see.

1629
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,800
All right, well, hopefully.

1630
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,000
All right.

1631
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,800
I have high hopes for it.

1632
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,600
Seems to be doing pretty well.

1633
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,480
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna get one.

1634
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,660
So, Loki.

1635
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:08,800
So, there's been a lot of talk of piracy this week,

1636
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,100
and one person, of course, to speak out about it

1637
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:16,360
is Gabe Newell, the head of Valve.

1638
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:20,080
And basically, one of the things he says

1639
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,800
is piracy's almost always a service problem,

1640
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,560
and not a pricing problem.

1641
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:27,640
And the way he puts it,

1642
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:31,620
it's we think there's a fundamental misconception

1643
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:32,460
about piracy.

1644
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,560
Piracy is always a service problem, not a pricing problem.

1645
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,880
For example, if a pirate offers a product

1646
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:40,040
anywhere in the world, 24-7,

1647
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:43,320
purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer,

1648
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,280
and the legal provider says that the product

1649
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,660
is region locked, will come to your country

1650
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:49,640
three months after a US release,

1651
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:52,480
and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store,

1652
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,120
then the pirate service is more valuable.

1653
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:57,300
Most DRM solutions diminish the value of the product

1654
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,880
by either directly restricting a customer's use,

1655
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,160
or by creating uncertainty.

1656
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:06,040
So, basically, kind of alluding to Assassin's Creed 2

1657
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:10,880
and the Ubisoft DRM, which we mentioned earlier,

1658
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,440
pretty much got destroyed in a few days.

1659
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,840
And then, of course, they're saying,

1660
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,940
Steam isn't without its own problems.

1661
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,840
Saints Row the Third, you know,

1662
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,980
used, I guess, Steamworks and stuff,

1663
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,440
and is unavailable on the UK Steam store

1664
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,560
for reasons that THQ are yet to elaborate on.

1665
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:34,120
So that kind of sucks that they don't have it yet.

1666
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,800
But, I mean, Steam's not perfect either,

1667
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,300
because their stuff gets pirated just as well.

1668
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:43,400
I was gonna-

1669
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,040
A lot of people seem to kind of be on board with Steam.

1670
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:45,880
Yeah.

1671
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:46,700
Sales help.

1672
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,400
I was gonna elaborate real quick,

1673
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:52,120
because it's not one of the stories that we had earlier,

1674
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:57,120
but some other people were talking piracy,

1675
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,440
and, funny enough, it's also Ubisoft,

1676
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,520
and their latest game to be coming out,

1677
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:06,960
well, ever delayed game to be coming out, I Am Alive,

1678
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:12,920
they were saying that, well, we're not gonna put it on PC,

1679
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,880
because piracy issues.

1680
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:20,880
Basically, the creative director, Stanislaus Metra,

1681
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,040
has basically said that PC piracy

1682
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:27,800
makes the financial viability of a game

1683
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,600
on the platform uncertain,

1684
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,080
and Ubisoft's previously announced title, I guess,

1685
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,840
is only planned for consoles,

1686
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,440
and, of course, that would be I Am Alive.

1687
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:41,440
So we heard loud and clear that PC gamers

1688
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:44,940
are bitching about there being no version for them.

1689
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,700
Interesting that they used bitching

1690
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:49,200
in their official statement.

1691
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:53,440
Says, but are these people just making noise

1692
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,960
because there's no version,

1693
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,960
or because it's a game they actually want to play?

1694
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,320
Would they buy it if we made it?

1695
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:06,720
And he continued saying that if 50,000 PC players

1696
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:09,620
buy the game, it's not worth the cost

1697
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:12,680
of putting a team of 12 on the project for three months.

1698
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:17,680
Says it's hard because there's so much piracy

1699
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,760
and so few people are playing PC games

1700
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:24,340
that we have to precisely weigh it up

1701
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:26,280
against the cost of making it.

1702
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:29,960
Of course, that pissed off everybody, all sorts of people.

1703
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,440
What's great, though, is shortly afterwards,

1704
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:37,760
after everyone completely complained about that,

1705
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:42,760
he backpedaled on that, and he's saying, let's see here,

1706
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:49,560
honestly, which game maker would not love to see his game

1707
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:51,840
to be playable on his main platforms

1708
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,200
and as by many people as possible?

1709
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,080
I don't know, it's hilarious.

1710
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:04,560
I hate to say it, but I kind of think dude has a point.

1711
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,200
I mean, a lot of games do get pirated on PC

1712
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,920
and I think it's part of the reason

1713
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:13,600
why developers are getting shy about it.

1714
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,200
And for example, Arkham City was hella delayed on PC.

1715
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,700
I bet, and even though the company's not very vocal

1716
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:22,040
about this and for good reason,

1717
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,400
obviously you see all this backlash,

1718
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:27,800
I honestly truly believe a big part of the delay for PC

1719
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,800
was so that consoles got the jump

1720
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,440
because it's all about playing it,

1721
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,040
and this goes back to Gabe Newell's point

1722
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:36,240
about convenience and getting it as soon as possible

1723
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,680
and the releases and all that.

1724
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,480
People wanna play it now.

1725
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,960
And I think because it's on the consoles early,

1726
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,360
I think it really helps.

1727
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,000
I mean, nothing's ever gonna stop piracy,

1728
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,760
but I think it helps turn a lot of people away from it.

1729
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,880
I mean, certainly piracy happens on the consoles too,

1730
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:52,760
but it's a lot harder.

1731
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:57,080
And Ubisoft further digs themselves deeper

1732
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:01,120
by skipping Ghost Recon Future Soldier on PC as well

1733
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,480
because, piracy, they even said,

1734
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,640
they're gonna do Ghost Recon Online,

1735
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,020
and said, when we started Ghost Recon Online,

1736
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:12,380
we were thinking about Ghost Recon Future Soldier

1737
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:14,520
having something imported in the classic way

1738
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,280
without any deep development

1739
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,640
because we know that 95% of our consumers

1740
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,520
will pirate the game.

1741
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,680
So we said, okay, we'll have to change our mind.

1742
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:25,880
Well, that's very positive that your game,

1743
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:28,280
you feel it's just gonna be pirated like crazy.

1744
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:33,280
And they're basically saying that there's no,

1745
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:35,520
we're giving away most of the content for free

1746
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,580
because there's no barrier to entry.

1747
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:40,920
And this is talking about Ghost Recon Online.

1748
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,820
And it says, to the users that are traditionally

1749
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:47,540
playing the game by getting it through Pirate Bay,

1750
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:49,920
we said, okay, go ahead, guys.

1751
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,080
This is what you're asking for.

1752
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,280
We've listened to you.

1753
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,700
We're gonna give you this experience.

1754
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:55,700
It's easy to download.

1755
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:58,260
There's no DRM that will pollute your experience.

1756
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,500
So basically, they're like,

1757
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:00,900
well, there's nothing we can do,

1758
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:01,740
so we're just gonna stop.

1759
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:03,540
So we've designed a free-to-play game.

1760
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:04,620
Yeah.

1761
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:05,820
Interesting tactic.

1762
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:09,440
You know, as much as I think people wanna hate this guy,

1763
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:13,560
I think it's somewhat of a fair response.

1764
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,260
I really do.

1765
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:16,100
Yeah.

1766
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:18,820
I mean, that is, but I am sorry.

1767
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:20,380
I am alive, though.

1768
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:22,720
First off, it's running and older.

1769
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,260
It's not like they have to create the engine

1770
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:25,180
totally from scratch.

1771
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:27,180
It's the Splinter Cell Conviction Engine.

1772
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:29,660
But, and it's also a game that's been delayed

1773
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:30,620
and delayed and delayed,

1774
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:32,340
and I don't think it's a game that really

1775
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,600
a lot of people are like, oh my God, I gotta play this.

1776
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,800
I think they're just pissed off that they're saying,

1777
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:40,140
oh, well, no one plays PC games.

1778
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:43,020
I think there's a lot of people who disagree with you.

1779
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,440
All right, I'm going to our chat room

1780
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:45,820
for some comments on some various stories

1781
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:46,660
we've been talking about,

1782
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:47,980
because obviously, we are the show

1783
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:49,740
where every gamer has a voice.

1784
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:50,580
Usually our...

1785
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:51,400
Except everyone.

1786
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,620
Usually our chat room is at chat.orangelandraday.com,

1787
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:55,100
but due to website issues tonight,

1788
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,720
we are giving you the long way of getting there,

1789
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,100
which is going on to IRC, the Game Surge Network,

1790
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:00,720
and we are at Channel Orange Lounge.

1791
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:01,740
Or you know what, for real,

1792
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:02,780
if you really don't know how to get there,

1793
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:05,620
just go to chat.allgames.com and ask them,

1794
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:06,700
how do I join Orange Lounge?

1795
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:07,520
They'll tell you.

1796
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,980
They're nice.

1797
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:09,800
Especially tonight.

1798
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:11,060
I told them, I said, please be nice,

1799
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:12,680
because we don't have a website.

1800
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,200
Anyhow, just some clarifications.

1801
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,580
Ever17.

1802
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:16,420
Rama figured it out.

1803
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:17,540
It's not an anime.

1804
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:20,420
It's a visual novel that's now been adapted to a game.

1805
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:22,660
So that's what Ever17 is.

1806
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:23,580
Let's see.

1807
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:26,860
Kajudo is talking about the Vita in Hong Kong,

1808
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:29,420
saying they're buying the Vita in Hong Kong

1809
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:30,700
so they can resell it.

1810
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:32,420
That's the only reason.

1811
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,780
Interesting perspective, because you might say,

1812
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:35,700
oh no, that can't be it,

1813
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:37,940
but that kind of shit happens in America, too.

1814
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:39,660
Like, you know, when the Wiis first came out,

1815
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:41,180
and hell, the Xboxes.

1816
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:42,740
Remember when people were buying up

1817
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:44,540
the limited Xbox supplies

1818
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:46,500
and then reselling them for twice as much?

1819
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,760
This shit happens with new tech all the time.

1820
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:51,220
So I could believe that.

1821
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:53,140
I can actually really believe that.

1822
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:53,980
So we'll see.

1823
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:56,280
I guess that isn't necessarily an indicator

1824
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,700
of how strong something's gonna sell,

1825
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:00,300
because people tried to do that with the 3DS,

1826
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,020
and it didn't work so well for them.

1827
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:03,340
I don't think they made money on that.

1828
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:05,580
So there you go.

1829
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:08,720
Kajudo in chat says there is only one way to stop piracy,

1830
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:10,080
make everything free.

1831
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,940
Yes, Kajudo, I need you to make me a sandwich,

1832
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:14,980
and don't you expect me to pay you for it?

1833
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:17,100
Just teasing.

1834
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:20,760
But he does go on to say it will never happen.

1835
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,600
Piracy will never,

1836
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:23,580
it will never happen.

1837
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,340
No one will, nowhere will piracy ever stop.

1838
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:30,560
So please stop torturing us with your shitty attempts at DRM.

1839
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:34,700
All right.

1840
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:35,660
Let's move on.

1841
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:39,440
Let's move on with one more story from me.

1842
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,140
Then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

1843
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,620
This is something we found

1844
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:44,100
when we tried to put together tonight's show

1845
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:45,360
without a website.

1846
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:46,760
We found this one quickly.

1847
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:49,700
It was something we found on Dig,

1848
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:53,920
and it's a blog post from a website,

1849
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,780
damnlag.com,

1850
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:58,260
and it's an article about game developers,

1851
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:01,460
you need to take your demos more seriously.

1852
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:03,480
And of course, now that I'm trying to bring it up in studio,

1853
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,320
it's not loading,

1854
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,860
the joys of live radio and internet timeouts.

1855
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:11,300
I did read the article a little bit before the show.

1856
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:14,300
I think an ad is trying to prevent this thing

1857
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:16,620
from popping up all the way or something.

1858
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:18,020
Yeah, the internet's working.

1859
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:20,820
Yeah, I know, no, the internet's working fine.

1860
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:21,740
Amazing.

1861
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:24,340
Damn people.

1862
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:29,580
So apparently this demo,

1863
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:31,900
he's talking about the Rayman Origins demo

1864
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:34,140
had recently, I was working for you, fantastic.

1865
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:35,740
It's not coming up on the computer over there.

1866
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:36,580
All right.

1867
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:39,260
So it's talking about how the Rayman Origins demo

1868
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:40,500
was really good,

1869
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:44,620
and the author of the article at damnlag.com

1870
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:46,340
was talking about how he's played through the demo

1871
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:49,300
several times and how it's just a great game.

1872
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:52,100
It kind of has elements of New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

1873
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:55,260
and mixing with the original Rayman and so forth.

1874
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:57,860
Saying that, I didn't really know about this game before.

1875
01:39:57,860 --> 01:40:00,160
Sure, I heard a little bit about it at E3,

1876
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,580
but I'm kind of throwing this in there.

1877
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:05,260
Let's face it, it's a really crowded time of year.

1878
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:06,780
There's a lot of video games out right now.

1879
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:09,100
It's really kind of hard to get the attention.

1880
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:10,540
And the article talks about how developers

1881
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:12,900
usually think of demos as an afterthought,

1882
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:16,420
that if they even bother to put one out at all.

1883
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:19,540
And then talks about, the article goes on to talk about

1884
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:24,540
how if you can get a customer to really experience the game

1885
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:27,880
or even a demo that's mid-game,

1886
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:29,300
citing like Heavenly Sword,

1887
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:30,340
something that kind of takes

1888
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:31,380
not just the beginning of the game,

1889
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,060
but something that's a little bit in the middle of the game,

1890
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:35,140
that's a really good demo.

1891
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:38,700
And then some companies actually do levels

1892
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,740
that are just for demos.

1893
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:45,740
Like DMA Design actually did something in the 90s

1894
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,620
where they did Lemmings demos

1895
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:50,700
that were like Christmas-themed levels, but free.

1896
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:53,220
So whatever happened to a good old-fashioned demo?

1897
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:55,100
Because a lot of games don't even bother with them.

1898
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:57,060
PEGL Extreme, I mean, if you want to look at that,

1899
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:00,660
that came out with all of the Valve branding on it.

1900
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:02,940
But it was, in essence, a free demo,

1901
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:05,500
because it says, hey, if you really liked playing this,

1902
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:09,780
and you get, I think like 10 levels or so of PEGL,

1903
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:11,500
it says, hey, if you like this,

1904
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,760
try out the real thing, here you go.

1905
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:17,420
So PopCap did it.

1906
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:21,200
Well, the reason why I wanted to talk about this story

1907
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:22,780
a little bit is I kind of wanted to ask you guys,

1908
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,820
how important is a demo for you guys

1909
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:27,140
in influencing your game buying decisions?

1910
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:29,200
I mean, do you like to use reviews?

1911
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,540
Do you just kind of jump in if it's cheap?

1912
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:33,820
Do you use game demos or what?

1913
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:37,980
I'll kind of answer this, is that I do like game demos.

1914
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:40,660
I don't think they're necessarily the most important thing

1915
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:42,860
in selling a game, because I think,

1916
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:44,580
especially now that we live in a day and age

1917
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:49,280
where we have Gamefly and hell, even now streaming games,

1918
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:52,100
thanks to OnLive and so forth,

1919
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:53,620
OnLive especially is interesting,

1920
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:55,420
because now your demo can just be,

1921
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:57,300
oh, play an hour of it for free,

1922
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:58,520
or something like what Steam did

1923
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,060
over the weekend with Magica.

1924
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:03,580
So I think there's a lot of that evolving,

1925
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:06,380
but I'm not gonna lie, a really good demo

1926
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:08,620
can absolutely sell a game, absolutely,

1927
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:11,220
because it leaves you wanting more, you know?

1928
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:14,380
Well, on top of that, you also get an idea of edits

1929
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:16,660
that they've made in games too,

1930
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:18,520
because a lot of times a demo's not gonna have

1931
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:21,040
all the edits that make it into the final game.

1932
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:25,380
And if you are clever and can get into the information

1933
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:28,380
on the disk, you can get more out of it, you know?

1934
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:31,260
But I mean, we've got a pile of PlayStation Magazine demos

1935
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:32,580
in Devault.

1936
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,620
Oh yeah, those PlayStation demos are always the bomb.

1937
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:35,460
Those are great.

1938
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:37,260
I've played so much Jumping Flash.

1939
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:40,300
From the demo disk that came

1940
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,720
with my friend's ex-boyfriend's PlayStation.

1941
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,860
Well, how many people bought, what was it,

1942
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:46,720
like Brave Fencer Mushashi or whatever,

1943
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,620
just because it came with the Final Fantasy VIII demo?

1944
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:49,460
Yes.

1945
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:53,820
Or there was, what game got the Final Fantasy VII demo?

1946
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:54,700
Can't remember.

1947
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,260
Toe Ball.

1948
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:58,180
Toe Ball.

1949
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,020
Yeah.

1950
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,340
Yeah, and that sold a lot just because of the demo too.

1951
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:01,880
But Toe Ball actually wasn't a bad game.

1952
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:03,720
Yeah, yeah, no, I know, but there's a lot of people.

1953
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:04,980
Really wish they'd make a new Toe Ball.

1954
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:05,860
They did a second one.

1955
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:07,540
Well, I know they did a second one, it was awesome,

1956
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:11,360
but I really wish they'd make a new Toe Ball.

1957
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,000
Going to the chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com,

1958
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,020
Act Def says, I usually ask people.

1959
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:19,340
JV Mon says, I use demos for franchises

1960
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:20,260
I'm not familiar with.

1961
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:21,540
If it wasn't for demos,

1962
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:25,340
I would never have bought Blue Dragon or Cold Seps Saga.

1963
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:27,060
Cold Seps Saga is awesome.

1964
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:28,580
Cold Seps Saga is an interesting one

1965
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:30,220
because I didn't play the demo for that,

1966
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:32,260
but a friend of mine got me into that

1967
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:33,460
and was like, this is the best game ever

1968
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:34,420
and nobody's ever heard of it.

1969
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:35,260
And it's true.

1970
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:36,660
Like I've never heard anything about that game,

1971
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:39,420
but it's like fricking Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.

1972
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:41,220
It was actually kind of awesome.

1973
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:43,880
Kaijuto says, demo made me buy Just Cause 2.

1974
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,200
I love that game.

1975
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:49,640
Hitstun goes so far as to make a little graph here.

1976
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,500
My usual considerations when buying games.

1977
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,460
Friends playing, greater than reviews,

1978
01:43:55,460 --> 01:44:00,000
greater than price, greater than hype, greater than demo.

1979
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,960
So kind of putting demo towards the end of the chain there.

1980
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,220
See, I honestly,

1981
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:08,500
because my friends have kind of different tastes

1982
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,880
all across the board.

1983
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:11,780
So one person may like something

1984
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:14,060
and I've turned out to completely hate it.

1985
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:16,100
I mean, because it's just how it is.

1986
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:19,180
I don't believe in making a judgment

1987
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:22,800
until I've played some of it, you know, or seen it played.

1988
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:27,620
So demos and, you know, online videos of a game

1989
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:31,140
really do more for me

1990
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:33,440
than relying on another person's opinion,

1991
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:34,300
if that makes sense.

1992
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:37,260
Not that I disrespect my friends' opinions,

1993
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:39,220
but it's just, honestly,

1994
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:40,740
there's games that a lot of people love

1995
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:43,140
that I'm like, what the hell?

1996
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,740
Like, to be perfectly honest,

1997
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:46,960
I'm kind of not all that into Skyrim.

1998
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,440
I don't care about Diablo 3 coming out.

1999
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:53,300
I mean, I really don't care.

2000
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:55,220
I really didn't care about Star Wars that much

2001
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:57,620
other than I'm missing something free.

2002
01:44:57,620 --> 01:45:02,620
I mean, you know what I like.

2003
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:04,740
I go for quirky and weird.

2004
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:07,300
So just because another person says they like it

2005
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:08,200
or one of my friends is playing,

2006
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,300
it doesn't necessarily mean that I'm gonna like it.

2007
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:11,860
I'd have to give it a try first.

2008
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:16,100
All right, but then Technus kind of gives us

2009
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:17,500
our final thought on this story here.

2010
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:21,360
I think not enough companies make demos for their games.

2011
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:24,160
It is a lot of work, though, to turn out a demo, I mean.

2012
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:28,940
But yeah, I think people discover games

2013
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:29,780
in many different ways,

2014
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:31,280
and a good demo is certainly one of them.

2015
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:34,120
But a bad demo can really damn your game.

2016
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:36,360
You know, one other thing, I guess I wanna open this,

2017
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,240
because I'm not so sure the article

2018
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:39,440
got into talking about this,

2019
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:43,140
but I think when it comes to the Xbox Live arcade games

2020
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:44,440
or PlayStation Network games,

2021
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:46,920
those demos can really make or break the damn game.

2022
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:49,120
I really do make my decisions based off those demos.

2023
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,240
I play those demos a lot, I really do.

2024
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:56,240
And I think those demos are really important,

2025
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,740
because especially when it's so easy,

2026
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:02,320
just press X to upgrade, you know what I mean?

2027
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:05,280
How easy is that if you really enjoy a demo?

2028
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:08,320
Anyhow, we're gonna now take a moment

2029
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,420
to dive into gaming history.

2030
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:13,660
With the classic Game of the Week segment.

2031
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:15,840
No demo needed here, you play it

2032
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,720
because Dark Soccer has said so.

2033
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:20,100
It's the classic Game of the Week.

2034
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:21,480
Very interesting choice this week.

2035
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:22,520
I hope that you picked the music

2036
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,760
from the first one on the list.

2037
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,720
There was no list this week, Dark Soccer,

2038
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:27,680
because of the website.

2039
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:29,080
But I told you what the game was.

2040
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:33,060
You did, so hopefully this is the right one, we'll see.

2041
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:33,900
Just play.

2042
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:38,960
Okay, so the Game of the Week is called Three Wonders,

2043
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:41,760
or as it was in Japan, Wonder Three.

2044
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,800
And it's an arcade game that was made by Capcom in 1991

2045
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,280
in a CPS1 game, and you can choose three games in it.

2046
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:50,720
You have Midnight Wanderers, Quest for the Chariot,

2047
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,880
which in Japan is called Roosters,

2048
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:57,880
and it has a hobbit named Lu and Shiva in it,

2049
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,480
which I wanna still say Shiva,

2050
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:01,480
because that's how it would have been pronounced

2051
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:03,280
in the Japanese version.

2052
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,040
Then there's Chariot, and then Trick through the Sky,

2053
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,520
which is also just called Chariot in Japan.

2054
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:09,280
And then Don't Pull.

2055
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:12,080
Midnight Wanderers is a platform game,

2056
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,880
and it's actually really, really cool.

2057
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:15,800
I've watched Dan play it through a number of times,

2058
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,960
and I've played it a little bit myself, pretty fun.

2059
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,440
And then Chariot is a shmup,

2060
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:24,240
where you have Lu and Shiva as well.

2061
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:26,780
And then Don't Pull is kind of like Pando.

2062
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:31,780
It's a pulling puzzle-type game.

2063
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:34,320
It came out in 1998 on the Sega Saturn

2064
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:35,620
and on the PlayStation.

2065
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:37,840
And then Capcom re-released it in 2006

2066
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:42,240
on the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 on PS2 and Xbox,

2067
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:46,400
and Capcom Classics Collection Remix 2 on PS3.

2068
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:49,440
Really, there's not a whole bunch to say,

2069
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:53,160
because they're really simple.

2070
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:54,120
They speak for themselves.

2071
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:59,120
I mean, I've seen a lot more of Midnight Wanderers

2072
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,560
than the other two, just because, you know,

2073
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:03,360
seeing Dan play through the whole thing is pretty fun.

2074
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,640
But I think what I like best about that one

2075
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:09,120
is I really, really, really love the art style in it.

2076
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:11,080
It's really cool.

2077
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:13,520
And I like the music in it a lot, too.

2078
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:14,520
Hit me, Dan!

2079
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:19,520
Get in here and tell us about the game.

2080
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:25,560
He said no, he's a butthead.

2081
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:30,560
But it really is very bright, vivid colors, very pretty.

2082
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,840
It's a great game.

2083
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:35,800
Lu also made it as an assist character

2084
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,280
for Marvel versus Capcom.

2085
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:43,240
And he basically looked exactly like he did

2086
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:45,380
in Midnight Wanderers.

2087
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:46,220
And then,

2088
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:54,060
Sheeva was actually,

2089
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:57,700
well, there was a character based on him for Cannon Spike.

2090
01:48:57,700 --> 01:49:01,100
It was called Sheeva Shintaro, who was based off of him.

2091
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:02,460
But, I mean, that's really it.

2092
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:04,620
I mean, it's kind of a no-brainer.

2093
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:06,620
Everyone should play this game.

2094
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:08,180
But really, everyone should just be playing

2095
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:10,020
the Midnight Wanderers part of the game.

2096
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:14,620
So the classic game of the week is Three Wonders.

2097
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:16,900
Or, if you want, it's just Midnight Wanderers, really.

2098
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:19,900
Yeah, but I mean, Chariot's not bad.

2099
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:20,740
Chariot's not bad.

2100
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:23,700
And I don't know, the puzzle game kind of pisses me off.

2101
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:25,600
But then again, I suck at Pingo.

2102
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:29,460
I like Pingo, so I would actually check out the puzzler.

2103
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:31,220
That sounds like kind of cool.

2104
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:33,420
And if anyone finds a Three Wonders machine,

2105
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:35,660
Freakin' take a picture of it for me.

2106
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:37,820
Yeah, I've never even heard of this game.

2107
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:39,340
I really haven't.

2108
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:40,940
And it even runs on, like, Capcom hardware.

2109
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:42,300
You'd think this thing would be everywhere, so.

2110
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:44,900
Well, you can, I mean, you can run it on May.

2111
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:46,820
I'm sure, yeah, emulator, easy, but.

2112
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:50,620
Yeah, but it's really neat, but yeah.

2113
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:53,180
I think just the star of the collection

2114
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:54,540
is Midnight Wanderers.

2115
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:55,380
All right, there you go.

2116
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:58,860
Your classic game of the week, Three Wonders in the arcade.

2117
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:00,420
Never on a console, right?

2118
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:02,380
I just said it came out on consoles.

2119
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:04,260
Sorry, I was trying to deal with another issue.

2120
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:06,900
It came out in 1998 on the Saturn and PlayStation.

2121
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:07,740
Oh, nice, okay.

2122
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:11,260
And then we got re-releases in 2006

2123
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:12,900
for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox,

2124
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:15,420
which was the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2.

2125
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:19,460
And then the PSP is Capcom Classics Collection remixed.

2126
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,220
All right, very cool.

2127
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:25,340
Very, very awesome thing to have.

2128
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:26,180
All right.

2129
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:28,860
Well, we're gonna take a break here at Orange Launch Radio,

2130
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:30,020
but don't go anywhere, guys.

2131
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:33,540
We'll be right back with part B of our show,

2132
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:34,820
which might be a little bit shorter,

2133
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:36,660
but that just means more time for calls

2134
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:40,860
and, and coming up tonight, a list-list.

2135
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:42,100
And we'll tell you guys the topic

2136
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,580
when we come back in a little bit

2137
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:46,900
with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2138
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:51,060
["Orange Lounge Radio Theme Song"]

2139
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:55,060
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio

2140
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:56,660
for the second half of our show,

2141
01:50:56,660 --> 01:51:01,160
live on November the 27th of 2011 at All Games Radio.

2142
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:03,620
Yes, our website's busted right now.

2143
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:05,540
If you try to visit it at OrangeLaunchRadio.com,

2144
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:07,780
you get a message that implies we haven't paid a bill,

2145
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:09,540
but trust me, if it was that easy to fix,

2146
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:11,980
we would've done it for the show.

2147
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:14,620
Keep in mind, our website is graciously donated,

2148
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:18,460
but you can't complain about free,

2149
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:20,880
so we just kinda have to wait for things

2150
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,600
to work themselves out behind the scenes.

2151
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:25,380
So anyhow, moving on, we are still trying to tape a show

2152
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:27,000
so that whenever our website does get back up,

2153
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,140
we can podcast it.

2154
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:29,940
And we're having fun with our live listeners

2155
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:31,100
who are in our chat room.

2156
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:33,180
You still can't get to our chat room,

2157
01:51:33,180 --> 01:51:35,260
even without chat.orangelaunchradio.com,

2158
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:36,220
which you can do.

2159
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:40,220
You can go to any IRC client,

2160
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:43,540
look up Gamesurge, which is the IRC.gamesurge.net,

2161
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:45,600
and join Channel Orange Lounge.

2162
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:48,340
You can also do that through the All Games chat client.

2163
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:50,980
So if you just go over to chat.allgames.com,

2164
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:52,400
if you really want something online,

2165
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:55,500
just join Channel Orange Lounge from there.

2166
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:56,500
That's really easy.

2167
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,480
We will be taking your phone calls a little later on,

2168
01:51:58,480 --> 01:51:59,320
and so forth.

2169
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,380
We also have a list list coming up,

2170
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:01,760
and we'll get to that very, very soon.

2171
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:05,380
I hope everybody in studio has their list together.

2172
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:07,180
We'll be taking your votes on that soon.

2173
01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:08,860
And you do have to be in our chat room

2174
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:10,240
if you want to participate with that.

2175
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:13,240
And no mailbag tonight, sadly.

2176
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:15,300
We can't get to the emails, don't.

2177
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,540
But we will be getting to your tweets.

2178
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:19,120
So get your tweets in.

2179
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:20,580
If you haven't already sent those in,

2180
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:23,860
twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2181
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:25,980
No rapid fire news tonight.

2182
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:28,320
We're just gonna get back right into some longer news.

2183
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,960
We'll start with, oh, I wanted to,

2184
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:32,900
actually, I did want to talk about this quickly.

2185
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:36,600
We talked about Black Friday stuff a little bit already,

2186
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:38,180
and just some of the craziness

2187
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:39,980
that was going on out there.

2188
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:42,460
One of the stories that I had actually grabbed

2189
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:45,380
was about folks that were actually pepper sprayed

2190
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:48,100
in the face and slammed and all this stuff.

2191
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:49,380
I think a lot of you guys heard about this.

2192
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:50,660
I'm sure it was all over the news.

2193
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:52,320
Some chick that was trying to get an Xbox

2194
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:54,980
actually pepper sprayed people trying to get to it.

2195
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:58,100
So people just getting crazy out there.

2196
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:00,900
I have zero desire to participate

2197
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,580
in any of this type of Black Friday antics,

2198
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:06,020
but I noticed that I was leaving a Thanksgiving dinner

2199
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:07,740
in the Bay Area at about 1130,

2200
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:10,140
and I had to drive, my friend that lives there

2201
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:13,360
lives right by that Fry's in Fremont.

2202
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,140
Or maybe it's actually Milpitas at that point.

2203
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:15,980
Yeah, Milpitas.

2204
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:18,380
Yeah, so I had to literally drive right by that.

2205
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:20,460
And yeah, parking lot was a madhouse,

2206
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:22,380
and there was already a line at 1130.

2207
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:23,740
You know, and it just, I was like,

2208
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:25,180
I do not want to be anywhere near here.

2209
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:26,540
And it's funny because you have Fry's

2210
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:27,860
on the left side of the road,

2211
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:30,460
and then Walmart on the right side of the road.

2212
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:32,620
And so like all the cars in the left turn lane

2213
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:34,240
were backed up and all the cars in the right turn lane

2214
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,080
were backed up.

2215
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:36,660
The only clear lane was the middle.

2216
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:38,220
You could zoom right down through the middle

2217
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:40,180
and get back on the freeway, which is right there.

2218
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:43,980
So it's just, I for one would never be out

2219
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:45,060
in this kind of madness, but.

2220
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:46,060
I didn't leave the house.

2221
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:47,340
No, I don't blame you.

2222
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:48,780
You know how some of the local Fry's,

2223
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:51,340
they have like themes to them and stuff.

2224
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:52,600
Like the one we have in Roseville

2225
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:54,860
is like railroad and stuff.

2226
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:57,300
The theme for the Fry's I'd given Milpitas

2227
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:59,180
is like black market.

2228
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:02,300
It's just cages and components.

2229
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:04,620
That's it, old school.

2230
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:06,620
It's like a science lab in there or something.

2231
01:54:06,620 --> 01:54:08,380
Yeah, so yeah.

2232
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:11,180
I am much more of a fan of Cyber Monday,

2233
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:12,300
which is coming up tomorrow.

2234
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:14,420
And I guess some of the sales are out there already.

2235
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:16,220
Wait till they figure out how to pepper spray you

2236
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:17,220
through the computer.

2237
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:21,260
There's always that tumbler.

2238
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:22,820
You can see that pepper spray guy,

2239
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:24,020
Oliver was pepper spray cop,

2240
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:25,780
pepper spraying cop, that tumbler.

2241
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:27,980
Also, I wanna mention this,

2242
01:54:27,980 --> 01:54:29,500
another great way to save money

2243
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:32,740
is through the sales online through services like Steam,

2244
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:35,300
who just had a pretty awesome sale, I gotta say.

2245
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:38,540
Portal 2 was $10 on Wednesday.

2246
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:41,820
Civilization 5 was $10 yesterday.

2247
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:43,100
They've been having some really good sales.

2248
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:44,620
I don't know if you guys have picked anything up.

2249
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:46,340
I actually didn't, I gotta admit,

2250
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:47,740
a lot of the games that were on sale

2251
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:48,580
that I would have bought,

2252
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:50,900
I already bought at full price earlier.

2253
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:52,380
So I didn't really indulge in the sale,

2254
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:53,860
except I did buy some DLC.

2255
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:55,860
I bought some Civ 5 DLC

2256
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:57,940
that I hadn't picked up before during the sale.

2257
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:59,780
Did you guys do,

2258
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:02,740
did you guys purchase anything through these sales?

2259
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:03,580
Nope.

2260
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:04,540
No?

2261
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:05,380
No?

2262
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:06,300
Oh.

2263
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:07,660
And what about you guys in our chatroom

2264
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:08,700
at chat.ownerswesterly.com?

2265
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:11,820
You know, I tried to poll the people on our Google+,

2266
01:55:11,820 --> 01:55:12,900
our new Google Plus page,

2267
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:14,320
and I kinda got a very similar response,

2268
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,900
where it's like, nah, didn't wanna be out fighting in it.

2269
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:18,500
I had a better time just kinda pointing

2270
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,340
and laughing at people.

2271
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:21,720
I've learned my lesson from going

2272
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,220
to some Black Friday stuff.

2273
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:25,700
Not necessarily lining up at like midnight or something,

2274
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:28,100
but just going there during the day.

2275
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:30,740
And I remember the last time I actually went out,

2276
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:31,920
well there was two times,

2277
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:32,920
there was one where I went out

2278
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:35,860
cause I actually needed some DVD-Rs,

2279
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:37,460
and so I went to Best Buy.

2280
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:38,740
It wasn't actually that bad.

2281
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:39,660
There was no one,

2282
01:55:39,660 --> 01:55:41,860
I mean it was just like in normal Saturday traffic.

2283
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:43,260
I think as long as you're not there

2284
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:47,380
like an hour or two before or after opening, it's fine.

2285
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:48,900
Yeah, so that was that.

2286
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:52,300
And then I went to Fry's one time,

2287
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:53,980
cause I was looking for something,

2288
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:55,220
I don't remember exactly what now,

2289
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:57,000
but Fry's was terrible.

2290
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,580
And it was like in the afternoon on Black Friday,

2291
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:05,260
and the line was just like an hour and a half long

2292
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:07,180
for whatever.

2293
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:10,220
And I mean, that's bad when they have

2294
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:12,460
like 30 registers open or something,

2295
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:14,800
but and that line is still that long.

2296
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,220
It was really bad.

2297
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:20,140
And they had a guy walking around the balloon,

2298
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:23,580
a giant like weather balloon that says line ends here,

2299
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:24,900
and he's basically,

2300
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:27,960
this line just snakes through the entire store.

2301
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:29,300
It was ridiculous.

2302
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:30,140
Crazy.

2303
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:32,180
But yeah, I don't really like doing that stuff,

2304
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:34,180
and even like the recent games I've got,

2305
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:35,540
I actually have Call of Duty,

2306
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:39,060
Modern Warfare 3 that I got for free,

2307
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:41,300
and Skyrim I got for free,

2308
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:42,900
cause every now and then the publisher

2309
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:45,180
likes to actually send us stuff.

2310
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:48,520
So I played that,

2311
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:50,780
but I'm not going to buy any new stuff.

2312
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:54,260
In fact, actually probably not gonna buy any new games

2313
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:55,540
for a long time.

2314
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:57,400
I don't really know what the next new game

2315
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:58,240
I'd probably get with.

2316
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:59,080
I gotta buy Mario Kart.

2317
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:00,660
Borderlands 2, but that's about it.

2318
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:02,360
I gotta buy Mario Kart.

2319
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:03,980
I still have a credit on Amazon though, so.

2320
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:06,660
I'm seriously thinking of trading in Modern Warfare 3

2321
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:09,740
for like probably,

2322
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:13,620
I'd probably lean more towards Super Mario Land 3D

2323
01:57:13,620 --> 01:57:14,460
than I would.

2324
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:15,280
It's great.

2325
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:16,120
It's really good.

2326
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:17,980
Mario Kart, cause Mario Kart's kinda,

2327
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:20,580
it's the same stuff all over again, you know?

2328
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:21,420
They don't really,

2329
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:24,260
they're like repeating old classic tracks

2330
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:26,020
instead of coming up with original stuff

2331
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:27,860
and then adding the classic tracks.

2332
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:31,660
We got a couple comments in our chat rooms.

2333
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:34,500
Evil, or E3VL, which I think he has evil,

2334
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:35,500
is in our chat saying,

2335
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,360
is the Cyber Monday sale separate

2336
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:39,540
from the Autumn sale on Steam?

2337
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:42,140
I'm not sure if Steam's gonna do something separate

2338
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:42,980
on Monday.

2339
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:44,060
I wouldn't anticipate it.

2340
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:45,220
Well there's also, remember,

2341
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:47,260
the Amazon Gold Box sales,

2342
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:48,940
which are always really good.

2343
01:57:48,940 --> 01:57:52,100
Cyber Monday is actually an internet-wide thing.

2344
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:54,760
It's kind of the internet's response to Black Friday,

2345
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:57,100
because Monday is when everybody goes back to work.

2346
01:57:57,100 --> 01:57:58,780
And I guess there's this perception

2347
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:00,700
that nobody actually works when they go back to work,

2348
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:02,660
instead they're online shopping all day.

2349
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:04,460
So all these companies do,

2350
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:07,080
all these companies do these big online sales on Monday.

2351
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,780
So it's totally a man-made invented thing,

2352
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:12,160
but hey, any excuse for a sale, right?

2353
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:14,580
So Steam may get in on it.

2354
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:17,820
I know Microsoft is supposed to be doing something.

2355
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:20,740
They've been doing some sales on Xbox Live all week.

2356
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:22,500
Like you can get things like Bejeweled 3,

2357
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:25,420
and God, some game was only like 240,

2358
01:58:25,420 --> 01:58:27,300
oh, I think it's Bejeweled Blitz or something,

2359
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:29,260
it's only like 240 Microsoft points,

2360
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:31,320
which is about what it's worth, so.

2361
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:34,160
JVMod in our chat room is talking about

2362
01:58:34,160 --> 01:58:36,020
some of the Black Friday sales he got.

2363
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:38,600
I got the $200 PlayStation 3 bundle,

2364
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:41,140
the $179.99 3DS bundle,

2365
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:43,980
the $199.99 42-inch TV,

2366
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:46,260
and a 3004 laptop.

2367
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:47,980
I don't know what a 3004 laptop is.

2368
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:49,140
I think he mistyped something.

2369
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:51,540
The rest of that is, sounds like you,

2370
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:53,540
dude, can I have a loan?

2371
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:55,100
Probably 300 for a laptop.

2372
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:56,540
Oh yeah, maybe that's what it is,

2373
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:57,360
300 for a laptop.

2374
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:59,440
Oh, $300, maybe shift F4.

2375
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:02,240
So that's nice though.

2376
01:59:02,240 --> 01:59:03,540
That's like your whole electronics

2377
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:05,460
for several years taken care of in one day.

2378
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:06,820
It's pretty nice.

2379
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:09,540
And Technus says, oh, and after working

2380
01:59:09,540 --> 01:59:12,760
a Black Friday myself, I cannot support it.

2381
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:13,940
You know, I got to say,

2382
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:15,840
props to you folks in retail,

2383
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:17,380
especially those of you on the front lines.

2384
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:20,020
I mean, yeah, people pepper spraying

2385
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:21,500
in Walmart and shit is madness,

2386
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:23,020
but can you imagine having to work

2387
01:59:23,020 --> 01:59:24,340
that Walmart that night?

2388
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:25,400
Oh my God.

2389
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:29,660
You poor people.

2390
01:59:29,660 --> 01:59:31,240
There's a very big reason why

2391
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:33,560
I never want to do retail again.

2392
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:36,300
That's, it's all summed up in one day right there.

2393
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:37,660
All right, let's move on with some gaming news.

2394
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:38,480
Logie.

2395
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:41,620
Well, just because you've done what,

2396
01:59:41,620 --> 01:59:42,760
10 of them in a row?

2397
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:45,360
Dan called us all blisses.

2398
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:47,780
Uh, yeah.

2399
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:51,820
I got a funny story, actually,

2400
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:54,060
about this story that I'm gonna talk about.

2401
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:55,640
First off, let's talk about this.

2402
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:57,280
Ridge Racer Vita.

2403
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,880
We were talking about why people pirate stuff.

2404
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:01,600
This is pretty bad.

2405
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,420
Ridge Racer Vita, it only includes

2406
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:06,980
three courses and five cars.

2407
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:08,720
It sounds almost like a demo to me.

2408
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:13,560
Apparently, according to the Japanese press sampling

2409
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:15,820
of Ridge Racer, they're surprised to find

2410
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:19,700
that the game only has a few tracks and a few cars.

2411
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:22,740
They said, of course, there will be download content,

2412
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:27,200
but it's just weird that there's so little material.

2413
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:31,440
Also, apparently, I guess there's also supposed

2414
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:32,900
to be this planetary league as well,

2415
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:36,300
which is a new mode that sounds kinda neat.

2416
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:38,860
Planetary league, I guess Namco is,

2417
02:00:38,860 --> 02:00:40,860
they're gonna be sending out team battle missions

2418
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:44,180
for multiplayer, plus it's also playable over Wi-Fi

2419
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:48,420
and ad hoc and all sorts of stuff,

2420
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:49,660
and you can share ghost data,

2421
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:54,660
but three tracks and five cars, really?

2422
02:00:55,420 --> 02:00:57,460
I mean, and on top of that.

2423
02:00:57,460 --> 02:00:59,400
Because you know it's gonna be DLC.

2424
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:01,900
And on top of that, okay, the game is supposed

2425
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:05,780
to be slightly cheaper than most of the Vita games,

2426
02:01:05,780 --> 02:01:07,500
but 40 bucks instead of 50.

2427
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:09,220
Exactly, exactly.

2428
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:10,300
Boo hiss.

2429
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:12,980
If this is true, if this is true,

2430
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:15,300
then fuck this game for real.

2431
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:17,420
And it only runs at 30 frames per second

2432
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:19,140
instead of 60 frames per second.

2433
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:22,600
And here's, I had a dream last night about this.

2434
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:25,740
I seriously, for some reason, and I don't even know why,

2435
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:26,860
because I read this earlier in the week,

2436
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:29,300
some reason I just had a dream about this,

2437
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:33,540
and I remember I was talking to some guy

2438
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:37,180
who apparently, in the dream, was representative

2439
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:40,020
of the person responsible for this game,

2440
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:41,660
and my response was this.

2441
02:01:41,660 --> 02:01:43,640
What the fuck were you thinking?

2442
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:45,100
I mean, really, seriously?

2443
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:47,860
Three fucking tracks and five cars?

2444
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:49,820
No one's gonna fucking buy this game.

2445
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:51,900
I don't give a shit if it's Ridge Racer.

2446
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:53,340
This is ridiculous.

2447
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:55,260
It's Ridge Racer.

2448
02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:56,540
The rest of the letters are available

2449
02:01:56,540 --> 02:01:59,100
in a $3.99 download content bundle pack.

2450
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:02,940
Not even, you wouldn't even finish Ridge.

2451
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:03,900
It'd be rid.

2452
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:05,820
That's all you get for this.

2453
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:07,580
I mean, three fucking tracks.

2454
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:08,420
Here's the thing.

2455
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:10,460
It's one thing to just openly reject this game

2456
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:11,660
if it does come out for $40.

2457
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:14,820
I hope this is just like maybe an early build,

2458
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:18,300
like a press build or something, like a demo.

2459
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:21,520
Maybe just they're really working to get the full game done

2460
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:23,500
and it's just not ready, you know?

2461
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:26,300
And it's not gonna be ready until it goes gold.

2462
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:28,940
I'm really hoping that's what happens.

2463
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:31,460
And soon we'll get this Japanese website that's like,

2464
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:33,540
comes with 20 tracks and 20 cars.

2465
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:34,380
You know, something like that.

2466
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:36,900
Oh, I hope so, because Ridge Racer's pretty awesome.

2467
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:39,020
I think for the launch, you know, the 3DS,

2468
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:41,740
it was one of the best games that they had available.

2469
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:42,580
It was, yeah.

2470
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:45,020
Even though there was all rehash stuff, but.

2471
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:48,540
But the 3D effects, it was a good 3D show-off game, yeah.

2472
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:50,740
But, I mean, seriously.

2473
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:52,580
I like Dungeon Buster in our chat room.

2474
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:54,340
Ridge rip-off.

2475
02:02:55,780 --> 02:02:58,540
It is just, and it's funny though,

2476
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:01,500
because I actually, I watched, I was reading this

2477
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:02,960
and then I watched the trailer.

2478
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,720
I'm like, hey, you know what?

2479
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:07,520
That trailer only shows these three tracks.

2480
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:09,680
I wonder.

2481
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:12,740
But it's gonna be one thing if the game

2482
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:14,420
comes out like this, but it's gonna be just

2483
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:17,620
flat out insulting if they add a bunch of tracks

2484
02:03:17,620 --> 02:03:18,980
as download content.

2485
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:20,860
Unless it's all free.

2486
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:22,460
If it's free DLC, they won't be.

2487
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:23,420
But why would they do that?

2488
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:24,260
They won't.

2489
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:25,080
No.

2490
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:29,240
If, now here's where I would support it.

2491
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:32,500
Remember on the PSP, they had Rockband.

2492
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:33,780
You can buy Rockband in the game.

2493
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:36,680
Then they also had Rockband where you could buy,

2494
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:39,600
or download the free demo, and then you pay for songs.

2495
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:41,160
Oh yeah, I remember that, yeah, yeah.

2496
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:42,000
I'm fine with that.

2497
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,380
If they wanna do this, like say,

2498
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:45,640
put it on the store and like, you know,

2499
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:48,600
okay, well, you can buy the game for nothing

2500
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:50,840
and it comes with three tracks and five cars

2501
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:53,640
and you can buy the rest of the game for DLC.

2502
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:54,980
I'm fine with that.

2503
02:03:54,980 --> 02:03:56,660
Or, you know, you pay 99 cents

2504
02:03:56,660 --> 02:03:58,640
and you get the rest of this later on.

2505
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:01,660
But as a retail game for like,

2506
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:03,560
I'm assuming this is gonna be 40 bucks.

2507
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:05,440
I have yet to see the setup information for this

2508
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:07,020
so I can't confirm on the price yet.

2509
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:08,640
Hopefully I'll know that soon.

2510
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:12,240
But this is, it's probably gonna be about a $40 game.

2511
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:13,700
Well, Namco, one thing you need to do

2512
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:15,960
when you get back to work this week after the holiday

2513
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:19,160
is you need to clarify, so I guess maybe in Japan

2514
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:20,320
they didn't really have the same holiday,

2515
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:22,680
but still, come next week at work,

2516
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:26,000
they need to clarify what the hell's going on here.

2517
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,400
What is this game actually gonna have in it?

2518
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:30,560
So hopefully next week we can correct that.

2519
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:33,040
Anyhow, let's move on.

2520
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:38,060
A story has hit computer and video games.com

2521
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:40,280
about two possible, as they're calling it,

2522
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:43,460
Xbox 720 models that are planned.

2523
02:04:43,460 --> 02:04:47,340
Apparently there's gonna be a dual SKU strategy expected,

2524
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:49,540
along with a significant Kinect upgrade.

2525
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:53,320
Long story short, you may or may not remember this,

2526
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:56,840
remember the Xbox 360 had two ways you could buy it.

2527
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:59,480
They had the, what, the regular, or,

2528
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:00,320
what was it called at the time?

2529
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:02,040
The core and the premium.

2530
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:04,540
And the leader, core and premium, yeah, that's right.

2531
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:09,360
And the non, one of them was what, $299, right?

2532
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:11,000
And that was no hard drive.

2533
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,880
$299 for the core, no hard drive.

2534
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:14,200
No onboard memory at the time,

2535
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:15,480
because this was the first Xbox.

2536
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:16,320
No hard drive, nothing.

2537
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:18,400
It's just basically the box, that's it.

2538
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,640
And then there was this elite version

2539
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:22,600
that came with a hard drive,

2540
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:27,400
and it came with, thank you, a wireless controller

2541
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:28,600
instead of a wired one.

2542
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:29,960
Yeah, that was the other big difference.

2543
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:32,120
And I think a shiny silver door

2544
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:33,800
as opposed to a plain white one.

2545
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:34,640
Yep.

2546
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:35,680
Whoopie doo, right?

2547
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:38,740
So apparently that's the road they're going down

2548
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:40,760
for whatever this next Xbox is,

2549
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:44,600
is that one will be a pared down system

2550
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:47,280
to be released as cheaply as possible,

2551
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:50,440
positioned more along the lines of a set top box,

2552
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:53,440
because 360 as a Netflix viewing device

2553
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:55,440
is apparently a huge deal,

2554
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:59,240
and perhaps a Kinect themed gaming portal.

2555
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:02,300
But then there will be a more fully featured machine

2556
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:05,080
with an optical drive, hard disk,

2557
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:08,140
and backward compatibility aimed at the hardcore

2558
02:06:08,140 --> 02:06:09,960
would be released at a higher price point.

2559
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:11,800
Listen to that again.

2560
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:13,080
There's going to be a vert,

2561
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:14,720
maybe if rumors are to be believed,

2562
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:16,080
and there's gonna be rumors or anything at this point,

2563
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:19,900
but maybe there's gonna be an Xbox with no drive.

2564
02:06:19,900 --> 02:06:22,660
Dude, I don't buy that there's not gonna be drive in there.

2565
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:24,520
Optical drives are so fucking cheap.

2566
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:27,720
It's just, why would you do that?

2567
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:30,560
I mean, because basically you're forcing people

2568
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:34,000
to buy the new product online.

2569
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,200
That's really the way they wanna go with it, then fine.

2570
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:38,000
But really no optical drive?

2571
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,280
I mean, drive, DVD drives?

2572
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:42,520
Okay, let's assume that it's gonna be a Blu-ray drive.

2573
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:46,220
Probably drives are not incredibly expensive anymore.

2574
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:48,960
I mean, they're not as cheap as DVD drives,

2575
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:50,400
that's for sure, but.

2576
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:51,760
You can get a Blu-ray player now

2577
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:53,640
for what, 80 bucks, 100 bucks?

2578
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:55,480
I can't imagine that those drives are that expensive.

2579
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:58,200
Those things used to be four or five hundred dollars.

2580
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:00,460
Of course, same thing could be said about DVD players.

2581
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:02,420
I remember a time when a DVD player was like,

2582
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:04,160
that's the thing the rich kids had.

2583
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:07,440
I just, I don't know.

2584
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:09,120
I mean, hey, whatever, that's fine.

2585
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:10,320
They're giving you options,

2586
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:13,520
so you don't have to buy the cheap, cheap, cheap one

2587
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:14,520
if you really wanna.

2588
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:19,600
So obviously a lot of this is still to be unveiled.

2589
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:22,720
Another rumor is that Kinect will likely get

2590
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:26,560
a significant upgrade and be bundled with the console.

2591
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:27,420
That all makes sense.

2592
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:29,800
I mean, I think Kinect is something Microsoft's kind of,

2593
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:34,800
you know, embedded in their self now.

2594
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:37,100
And I think Kinect was supposed to be

2595
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:38,380
a higher resolution to begin with.

2596
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:41,320
They had to kind of take it down a resolution a little bit

2597
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:44,720
to work with the system as it was today.

2598
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:46,640
But like, you know, remember we're seeing the patents

2599
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:49,000
for like it was gonna read sign language and shit?

2600
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,060
Like if it had the higher resolution, it could do that.

2601
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:53,880
But it'll get better.

2602
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:54,720
It'll be interesting.

2603
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:57,140
Yeah, the technology will get better, that's for sure.

2604
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:58,480
But then here's the other thing.

2605
02:07:58,480 --> 02:07:59,920
Can I tell you the thing that bothers me most

2606
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:01,640
about this story?

2607
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:05,720
As that it's called two Xbox 720 models reportedly planned.

2608
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:10,560
Okay, seriously, we need to stop calling it the Xbox 720

2609
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:12,120
because that is a stupid name.

2610
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:14,160
It's not gonna be called the Xbox 720.

2611
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:15,400
Why would you call it that?

2612
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:20,400
Okay, the Xbox 360 did not come after the Xbox 359, okay?

2613
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:24,720
It's not, you know, and I get it 360 times two is 720.

2614
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:26,040
But you know what?

2615
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:29,200
Something tells me they're gonna just go another direction

2616
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:30,680
with the name.

2617
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:33,320
As to what direction they're gonna go with the name?

2618
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:37,980
Well, we thought we would bring back one of our old friends

2619
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:39,320
to help us figure that out.

2620
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:42,260
What exactly that name could be.

2621
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:43,980
And that is a segment on the show

2622
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:46,220
we like to call listless.

2623
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:50,780
That's right.

2624
02:08:50,780 --> 02:08:55,780
Tonight's listless topic is what should we refer

2625
02:08:56,100 --> 02:08:57,720
to the new Xbox as?

2626
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:59,280
What should the new Xbox be called?

2627
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:02,020
What should we refer to it as here on the program?

2628
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:04,560
Because we're not calling it the Xbox 720 anymore.

2629
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:08,220
So what should the new name for the Xbox two

2630
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:09,260
or whatever it's gonna be,

2631
02:09:09,260 --> 02:09:11,240
or I guess it would really be Xbox three,

2632
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:12,660
what should it be called?

2633
02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:15,580
Okay, so if you wanna give us suggestions,

2634
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:18,100
you can in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.

2635
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:20,420
But this is a highly scientific process, people.

2636
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:21,500
Here's the way the list works

2637
02:09:21,500 --> 02:09:25,020
if you've never listened to listless before on the show.

2638
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:27,200
We're each gonna go around and give our top three answers.

2639
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:28,780
That'll come up with a list of nines.

2640
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:29,640
We have no guests tonight.

2641
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:31,800
Usually it's a list of 12, not tonight.

2642
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:33,080
But then we're each gonna go around

2643
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:35,100
and take one off the list.

2644
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:36,260
Oh, that's the hard part.

2645
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:38,320
That'll leave a list of six,

2646
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:41,200
which you guys will go around and vote on your number one

2647
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:42,620
and number two answers for.

2648
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:44,660
And we're gonna get a definitive answer

2649
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:48,940
for what should the new Xbox be called?

2650
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:49,780
All right.

2651
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:53,260
So chat.orangelandradio.com

2652
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:54,180
if you wanna give our suggestion.

2653
02:09:54,180 --> 02:09:56,980
Excuse me, I forgot that doesn't work tonight.

2654
02:09:56,980 --> 02:09:59,180
Channel Orange Lounge on IRC Game Surge

2655
02:09:59,180 --> 02:10:00,900
if you wanna give your suggestions.

2656
02:10:00,900 --> 02:10:03,060
Let's start building the list.

2657
02:10:03,060 --> 02:10:06,580
So we will start with, we'll start with Loki tonight.

2658
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:07,700
Your number three answer,

2659
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:09,580
what should they call the new Xbox?

2660
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:11,440
Or what should we refer to it as here on the show?

2661
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:14,280
Well, the way they have been changing their naming schemes

2662
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:16,340
for things like, especially Windows operating system

2663
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:18,260
and stuff before it used to be Windows 95,

2664
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:20,100
Vista, and they'd have clunky names.

2665
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:23,340
Now it's Windows 7 and they're talking about Windows 8.

2666
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:26,440
So I'm just gonna say Microsoft Xbox 3.

2667
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:29,120
And when I close my eyes, it's all that I need.

2668
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:31,200
Because it's simplified that's,

2669
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:34,200
I know it makes no sense, 363, but whatever.

2670
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,360
So you're just gonna say, just call it the Xbox 3.

2671
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:37,180
Xbox 3.

2672
02:10:37,180 --> 02:10:38,020
Why not?

2673
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:39,020
It works for PlayStation.

2674
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:40,180
Why not?

2675
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:41,200
All right.

2676
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:44,880
Let's go to DarkSakura, your number three answer

2677
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:46,460
for what should the new Xbox be referred to

2678
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:47,520
as here on the program?

2679
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:48,800
Xbox 420.

2680
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:55,400
I wonder what this system does.

2681
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:58,680
Oh man, suddenly I want to eat some Cheetos.

2682
02:10:58,680 --> 02:11:00,560
Oh, what do you want to play?

2683
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:01,400
Fuck it.

2684
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:06,560
Why is Cheech and Chong suddenly the spokespeople

2685
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:07,980
for this system?

2686
02:11:07,980 --> 02:11:10,760
Or I guess now it's Harold and Kumar, I guess.

2687
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:12,640
The Xbox 420, got to make some more of them.

2688
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:14,480
All right, the Xbox 420.

2689
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:15,320
All right.

2690
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:16,140
I don't know, man.

2691
02:11:16,140 --> 02:11:18,000
They have Neil Patrick Harris back in the system.

2692
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:18,840
That's true.

2693
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:21,280
That is an unstoppable force right there.

2694
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:23,400
Can I just say for a minute on a completely random,

2695
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:26,520
stop the list list, the new Muppets movie

2696
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:27,780
was so fucking awesome.

2697
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:33,600
Like for real, it was a kid's movie for 30 year olds.

2698
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:34,480
He has a cameo.

2699
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:36,840
A lot of people have a cameo that they don't tell you about.

2700
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:38,120
Neil Patrick Harris is one of them.

2701
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:39,680
Also, and it's a great line too.

2702
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:44,140
His voice makes the line for California screaming tolerable.

2703
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:44,980
Yes.

2704
02:11:44,980 --> 02:11:47,640
I'm just saying the new Muppets movie is really fucking good.

2705
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:49,980
It's a little bit hokey cause it's a kid's movie,

2706
02:11:49,980 --> 02:11:51,520
but it's great.

2707
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:53,120
When someone buys my ticket, I'll go see it.

2708
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:54,640
What cameo?

2709
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:56,800
Line for what?

2710
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:00,040
Okay, he's now the announcer for California screaming.

2711
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:03,240
So he does the safety announcement,

2712
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:05,540
kind of like a fair barker.

2713
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:08,720
And then when you're in, sorry Rob.

2714
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:11,000
Sorry, it's a name suggested in chat.

2715
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,980
See, you in the chat can influence the list

2716
02:12:13,980 --> 02:12:15,000
cause I just saw a name in there

2717
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
I am fucking taking for the list.

2718
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:22,000
So when you're actually in the thing ready to go,

2719
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,560
it says second thoughts, too late.

2720
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:26,940
Five, four, three, two, one, boom.

2721
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:28,800
Nice, all right.

2722
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,200
So it makes it all the way better.

2723
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:31,560
All right, back to the list.

2724
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:35,320
So so far we have Microsoft Xbox three and Xbox four 20.

2725
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:37,720
I now I have to explain this name a little bit.

2726
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:41,740
My name is the Dex box.

2727
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:45,660
The Dex box because Dex is short for what

2728
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:48,320
in Dungeons and Dragons speak dexterity.

2729
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:51,920
That's something that thieves have a high amount of.

2730
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:53,720
So it's the Dex box.

2731
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,960
And so via Microsoft Dex box steal from you.

2732
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:00,160
You know what?

2733
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:01,060
I always played Rangers.

2734
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:02,200
All right.

2735
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:05,640
The Microsoft Dex box is my answer.

2736
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:07,980
Let's go to Loki for your number two answer.

2737
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:12,040
Oh, I'm trying to think of really stupid Microsoft names.

2738
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:17,360
Let's see.

2739
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:20,600
The Microsoft windows eight entertainment system.

2740
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:22,360
Yes, it's very generic and stupid,

2741
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:23,200
but you know what?

2742
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:24,320
It's something that sounds like

2743
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:26,440
it could be a Microsoft product.

2744
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:28,400
The windows eight entertainment system.

2745
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:30,000
Who would call it the waiters?

2746
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:33,720
Waiters.

2747
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,060
There's a fly in my soup waiters.

2748
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:43,200
Only if Harvey Fierstein can be the spokesperson

2749
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:44,560
for the waiters.

2750
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:45,400
That would be great.

2751
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:51,680
I call my mother and tell her to get a waiters.

2752
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:53,120
You could have been a doctor,

2753
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:54,840
but instead you're a waiters.

2754
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:58,120
I don't know why.

2755
02:13:58,120 --> 02:13:59,480
When I hear the name waiters,

2756
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:01,360
I think about Harvey Fierstein,

2757
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:02,320
but it just works.

2758
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:03,160
Doesn't it?

2759
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:06,700
I could have retired and broke her.

2760
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:07,800
The waiters.

2761
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:09,580
It has high definition connect.

2762
02:14:09,580 --> 02:14:14,580
You can see how big your wiener is.

2763
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:22,120
It's the way it is.

2764
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:24,020
And I'll tell you eight isn't enough.

2765
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:26,560
Okay.

2766
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,400
Moving on.

2767
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:29,600
Dark soccer.

2768
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:32,120
What's your number two pick?

2769
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:33,280
Zoom box.

2770
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:35,040
I almost said your number eight pick.

2771
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:36,800
Your number two pick zoom box.

2772
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,640
Zoom box.

2773
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:38,960
Oh, zoom box.

2774
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:40,440
X, U, N, E, B, O, X.

2775
02:14:42,640 --> 02:14:45,040
You want to spell it with an X instead of a Z?

2776
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:48,040
Oh, okay.

2777
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:48,880
Yeah.

2778
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:49,720
No, I like it.

2779
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:51,600
It's like, it's like Shusha.

2780
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:52,720
Or you can spell it with a Z.

2781
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:53,560
That's fine.

2782
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:54,400
You have to spell it with a Z

2783
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:55,640
because that's what the thing is.

2784
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:56,480
I don't know.

2785
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:57,600
I was just in the X thing.

2786
02:14:57,600 --> 02:14:58,440
Okay.

2787
02:14:58,440 --> 02:14:59,260
Zoom box.

2788
02:14:59,260 --> 02:15:00,320
Even though I think Microsoft retired

2789
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:01,600
the zoom some time ago.

2790
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:03,560
Oh yeah.

2791
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:04,400
They have zoom work.

2792
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:05,240
Okay.

2793
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:06,060
Zoom box.

2794
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:06,900
I could see that.

2795
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:07,740
Maybe the zoom would be safe.

2796
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:10,880
Cause it's cooler to have it zoom box.

2797
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:11,720
Oh, sorry.

2798
02:15:11,720 --> 02:15:12,560
No dash.

2799
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:13,380
Yeah.

2800
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:14,220
That's how I would brand it.

2801
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:15,060
If they would hire me.

2802
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:17,200
Damn it.

2803
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:18,040
Microsoft.

2804
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:19,160
You should hire me to be your designer

2805
02:15:19,160 --> 02:15:20,160
because I'm amazing.

2806
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:22,460
And I make all your stuff look like Apple stuff.

2807
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:26,400
All right.

2808
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:27,240
Let's move on.

2809
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:28,600
My number two answer.

2810
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:30,480
I'm going to just put this.

2811
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:31,780
This is the rumored name.

2812
02:15:31,780 --> 02:15:34,040
And I do like this as a name for the system.

2813
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:36,860
And just in case this really is the name,

2814
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:38,440
I would like to be able to say we were right.

2815
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:39,440
And we called it on the list.

2816
02:15:39,440 --> 02:15:42,200
So I'm going to put X-Box loop on the list.

2817
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:43,500
Cause loop is the rumored name

2818
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:44,960
or at least the working title.

2819
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:48,140
That's a stupid name.

2820
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:49,080
Well, it makes sense though.

2821
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:51,080
360 and then loop.

2822
02:15:51,080 --> 02:15:51,900
I don't know.

2823
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:53,000
It's X-Box loop.

2824
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,640
It makes me think back to the books I was reading.

2825
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:58,200
Spiral, loop, and then.

2826
02:15:58,200 --> 02:15:59,040
All right.

2827
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:02,360
So that means that like some crazy ass dead girl

2828
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:04,460
is going to climb out of my X-Box loop.

2829
02:16:04,460 --> 02:16:07,900
When I don't change a disc for seven days.

2830
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:09,100
And that's how they'll market it.

2831
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:10,860
Is that, you know, in seven days,

2832
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:12,100
this machine will kill you.

2833
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:13,500
All right.

2834
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:15,460
Number one answer time.

2835
02:16:15,460 --> 02:16:17,620
Loki, number one for the list.

2836
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:19,580
Let's see.

2837
02:16:22,580 --> 02:16:27,060
I'm going to do, let's see the Microsoft,

2838
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:32,060
the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.

2839
02:16:32,060 --> 02:16:37,060
There we go.

2840
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:40,900
The Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.

2841
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:42,820
Wherever did that name come from?

2842
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:45,460
They named it after the players.

2843
02:16:48,460 --> 02:16:51,180
We took your feedback and we incorporated it

2844
02:16:51,180 --> 02:16:54,540
into the name of our new machine and our problem.

2845
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:56,980
We have an algorithm running that monitors

2846
02:16:56,980 --> 02:17:00,900
all sorts of voice communication over the system

2847
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:03,420
and it's generated the perfect name

2848
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:05,940
for our system based off of the language

2849
02:17:05,940 --> 02:17:07,220
that is used the most.

2850
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:12,260
It's the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur

2851
02:17:12,260 --> 02:17:14,300
or the MTRS.

2852
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:16,740
Okay.

2853
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:20,540
Dark Sakura, your number one answer.

2854
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:21,740
It's completely stupid.

2855
02:17:21,740 --> 02:17:22,920
It's X rhombus.

2856
02:17:23,900 --> 02:17:25,780
Cause I would really like to see them make something

2857
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:27,140
in the shape of a rhomboid.

2858
02:17:28,660 --> 02:17:29,500
All right.

2859
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:31,300
Smell and shit.

2860
02:17:31,300 --> 02:17:32,140
Okay.

2861
02:17:32,140 --> 02:17:33,900
I'm going to say for my number one is okay.

2862
02:17:33,900 --> 02:17:36,640
Originally I was going to do the X-Box penetrator,

2863
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:41,180
which I still like as a name, but I got to say,

2864
02:17:41,180 --> 02:17:44,060
I was won over by something that was suggested in chat

2865
02:17:44,060 --> 02:17:47,280
because somebody brought up an old ass OLR joke.

2866
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:50,620
That's seriously like seven years old at this point.

2867
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:53,260
So I give props to, I think it was SSJ 100 Matt

2868
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:54,100
that said it.

2869
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:55,620
Yeah, it was SSJ 100 Matt that said it.

2870
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:58,500
I'm going to go with his answer for my number one,

2871
02:17:58,500 --> 02:18:02,240
the X-Box non-silon occupied Caprica.

2872
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:10,540
Because this robots for the good guys,

2873
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:13,500
we promise as these devices in our living room

2874
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:15,020
become more self-aware.

2875
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:18,300
The X-Box non-silon occupied Caprica.

2876
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:19,140
All right.

2877
02:18:20,020 --> 02:18:21,340
This is a really shitty list.

2878
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:23,180
It is.

2879
02:18:23,180 --> 02:18:24,460
This is one of our worst.

2880
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:25,280
All right.

2881
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:26,120
At least we got Harvey Fierstein.

2882
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:26,960
All right.

2883
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:29,900
So we have the Microsoft X-Box three,

2884
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:34,820
the X-Box four 20, the Dex box,

2885
02:18:34,820 --> 02:18:38,700
the waiters, the windows eight entertainment system,

2886
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:42,700
the Zune box, the X-Box loop,

2887
02:18:42,700 --> 02:18:46,120
the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur,

2888
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:51,120
the X rhombus and the X-Box non-silon occupied Caprica.

2889
02:18:52,460 --> 02:18:54,860
I think what I'm going to do just because, you know,

2890
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:56,720
we don't have a fourth person with us tonight

2891
02:18:56,720 --> 02:18:57,560
doing this with us.

2892
02:18:57,560 --> 02:18:59,620
I'm going to go with one I'm seeing in chat a lot

2893
02:18:59,620 --> 02:19:01,160
and just add it to the list.

2894
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:03,380
I'm going to go with the X-Box lube,

2895
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:05,500
which I'm seeing in the chat several times.

2896
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:07,700
And I think that's off of mispronunciation.

2897
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:08,540
I made a couple-

2898
02:19:08,540 --> 02:19:09,560
Let's call Dan in to pick one too.

2899
02:19:09,560 --> 02:19:11,820
A couple of weeks ago on the show,

2900
02:19:11,820 --> 02:19:13,820
I think I said I was talking about the loop

2901
02:19:13,820 --> 02:19:16,420
and I think I accidentally said the mic for the X-Box lube

2902
02:19:16,420 --> 02:19:17,260
or something like that.

2903
02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:19,900
And so everybody's like, let's call it that.

2904
02:19:19,900 --> 02:19:20,740
So fine.

2905
02:19:20,740 --> 02:19:21,560
You're ready.

2906
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:22,520
That'd be the game.

2907
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:23,360
We're.

2908
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:28,360
It's time to open up some room in your entertainment system.

2909
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:35,680
Oh, Dan, Dan's voting for waiters.

2910
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:36,520
All right.

2911
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:38,320
Forget it.

2912
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:39,140
We got to go to the next thing.

2913
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:39,980
All right.

2914
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:40,820
We added one based on chats.

2915
02:19:40,820 --> 02:19:42,060
We added X-Box lube.

2916
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:43,340
So now we have a list of 10.

2917
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:45,780
We're going to take this down to a list of seven.

2918
02:19:45,780 --> 02:19:50,520
Sadly, it's time to start eliminating things from the list.

2919
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:51,360
Lucky.

2920
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:52,540
Oh wait, let me read you the list so far.

2921
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:53,380
Oh wait.

2922
02:19:53,380 --> 02:19:54,200
I already did.

2923
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:55,040
Sorry.

2924
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:55,880
I'm excited.

2925
02:19:55,880 --> 02:19:57,220
Do you need more soda?

2926
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:58,540
The X-Box lube gets me excited.

2927
02:19:58,540 --> 02:20:00,040
What's wrong, Rob?

2928
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:02,260
So hard.

2929
02:20:02,260 --> 02:20:03,500
Waiters.

2930
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:04,700
I need more sugar.

2931
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:07,340
You're my sugar nut.

2932
02:20:08,740 --> 02:20:10,780
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2933
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:11,920
Dex Fox.

2934
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:14,780
You didn't like my dexterity joke.

2935
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:16,700
It's stretching it.

2936
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:17,540
Sounds too much.

2937
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:22,540
Oh, it's stretching it yet another catchphrase

2938
02:20:23,940 --> 02:20:25,380
for the X-Box lube.

2939
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:31,580
Stretching the bounds of your imagination.

2940
02:20:32,620 --> 02:20:34,020
Can you take this all in?

2941
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:35,860
All right.

2942
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:37,020
We have to take it slow.

2943
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:41,520
Dark soccer.

2944
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:42,620
The cat new catchphrase.

2945
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:43,820
Just try to relax.

2946
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:46,540
Dark soccer.

2947
02:20:46,540 --> 02:20:48,420
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

2948
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:50,420
It's nothing against you, Rob.

2949
02:20:50,420 --> 02:20:51,260
But?

2950
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:54,260
But I'm taking off X-Box lube

2951
02:20:54,260 --> 02:20:55,580
because I think it's...

2952
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:58,180
I hope that's not the official name

2953
02:20:58,180 --> 02:20:59,620
and I wouldn't want us to be associated

2954
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:01,300
with it if it's the official name.

2955
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:03,700
All right, so the X-Box lube comes off the list.

2956
02:21:03,700 --> 02:21:05,940
Dang, you guys eliminated almost my whole list.

2957
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:06,780
All right.

2958
02:21:06,780 --> 02:21:07,820
Well, I'm not taking my own answer off.

2959
02:21:07,820 --> 02:21:09,760
I gotta leave at least one up there.

2960
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:11,940
So the one I'm gonna take off...

2961
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:14,420
I'm gonna take off Microsoft X-Box 3.

2962
02:21:14,420 --> 02:21:15,260
It's just...

2963
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:16,100
Stupid.

2964
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:16,940
Yeah, it's...

2965
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:17,900
The PlayStation does that.

2966
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:18,740
Come on.

2967
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:21,900
I am making the chatters be more creative tonight

2968
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:23,580
than pick that answer.

2969
02:21:23,580 --> 02:21:24,900
All right.

2970
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:26,620
So here it is.

2971
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:29,260
This is the official list that you can vote on.

2972
02:21:30,180 --> 02:21:31,620
I wonder what's gonna win.

2973
02:21:31,620 --> 02:21:33,900
Your number one and number two answers are welcome

2974
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:36,340
through private message to sky in the chat room right now.

2975
02:21:36,340 --> 02:21:37,220
Here it is.

2976
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:39,000
X-Box 420.

2977
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,020
Windows 8 Entertainment System.

2978
02:21:41,020 --> 02:21:41,940
Waiters.

2979
02:21:41,940 --> 02:21:43,020
Zoonbox.

2980
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:45,380
Microsoft Teabag Rage Quit Racial Slur.

2981
02:21:45,380 --> 02:21:46,340
X-Rombus.

2982
02:21:46,340 --> 02:21:48,700
X-Box Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.

2983
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:50,700
And the X-Box Lube.

2984
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:53,480
Send a private message to sky with your votes

2985
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:55,900
for number one and number two answers.

2986
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:58,060
If you don't say which is one and which is two,

2987
02:21:58,060 --> 02:21:59,580
then I assume your first one is one

2988
02:21:59,580 --> 02:22:00,940
and your second one is two.

2989
02:22:01,980 --> 02:22:04,100
And of course now everybody is coming up.

2990
02:22:04,100 --> 02:22:05,360
Everybody's a comic now.

2991
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:06,600
Act deaf in our chat room.

2992
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:07,580
X-Box Lube.

2993
02:22:07,580 --> 02:22:08,780
Get ready to stretch.

2994
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:09,620
Hecht.

2995
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:10,440
X-Box Lube.

2996
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:11,400
We're stretching it.

2997
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:12,480
Dungeon Buster.

2998
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:16,280
Gives new meaning to the term Red Ring of Death.

2999
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:21,280
Oh, we're so mature.

3000
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:24,140
All right.

3001
02:22:24,140 --> 02:22:27,820
I'm glad you guys decided on some high brow entertainment

3002
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:28,660
for your day.

3003
02:22:29,620 --> 02:22:30,460
All right.

3004
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:32,060
Sadly, there's no mailbag tonight.

3005
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:33,900
Sadly.

3006
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:34,740
But there's always,

3007
02:22:34,740 --> 02:22:38,900
but there's always time for some FUs of the week.

3008
02:22:38,900 --> 02:22:43,900
Yay.

3009
02:22:54,620 --> 02:22:57,220
FU to stuff and things.

3010
02:22:57,220 --> 02:23:00,240
And the stuff and things are actually stuff and things

3011
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:02,460
that I'm not liberty to openly discuss.

3012
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:05,660
And then FU to,

3013
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:09,540
I'm going to get political here.

3014
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:13,140
FU to people who vote a straight party ticket

3015
02:23:13,140 --> 02:23:18,140
and FU to people in high positions

3016
02:23:18,620 --> 02:23:20,180
who think they can cheat and get away with it

3017
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:22,580
because they have cheated and gotten away with it.

3018
02:23:22,580 --> 02:23:24,560
People wonder why everyone's so pissed.

3019
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:25,400
Done.

3020
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,860
Fuck you to the local news stations

3021
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:32,140
for counting down to Black Friday.

3022
02:23:32,140 --> 02:23:33,620
It was so annoying.

3023
02:23:33,620 --> 02:23:35,800
It's 11 o'clock and there are people lined up.

3024
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:36,640
Yes.

3025
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:38,220
People line up every single year.

3026
02:23:38,220 --> 02:23:39,740
It's not fucking news.

3027
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:43,260
Don't be amazed that people are lined up for sales.

3028
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:45,040
They do it all the damn time.

3029
02:23:47,740 --> 02:23:51,620
FU to the fact that my vacation from work is almost over.

3030
02:23:51,620 --> 02:23:52,540
I mean, I like my job and all,

3031
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:55,540
but I really like sitting at home on my ass doing nothing.

3032
02:23:55,540 --> 02:23:58,740
And then FU to the fact that I'm like really getting hungry,

3033
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:02,160
but I have a lovely dinner that Alan's been working on

3034
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:03,720
literally all day in the crock pot,

3035
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:04,680
waiting for me when I get home.

3036
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:05,860
So I have that to look forward to.

3037
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:09,380
But in the meantime, God damn, I want a donut.

3038
02:24:09,380 --> 02:24:11,080
FU to donuts for being delicious.

3039
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:13,960
Fuck you to Krispy Kreme not being in Northern California.

3040
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:15,620
I get Krispy Kreme in two months.

3041
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:18,020
FU to Krispy Kreme not being next door.

3042
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:19,420
I get Krispy Kreme in two months.

3043
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:20,900
Did you work that all out?

3044
02:24:20,900 --> 02:24:21,920
Huh?

3045
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:24,020
Well, that's still the goal time, so.

3046
02:24:24,020 --> 02:24:25,020
Gotcha.

3047
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:27,740
All right, well, let's go back to some gaming news

3048
02:24:27,740 --> 02:24:29,900
and then the Skypline's coming up real soon.

3049
02:24:29,900 --> 02:24:31,700
1877 Game OLR, but not yet

3050
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:33,180
because we still have a few more stories to get through

3051
02:24:33,180 --> 02:24:34,460
starting with Loki.

3052
02:24:34,460 --> 02:24:37,860
Yes, we were talking about new Xbox systems

3053
02:24:37,860 --> 02:24:41,900
and well, this is something that is kind of branching out

3054
02:24:41,900 --> 02:24:43,300
the Kinect a little bit.

3055
02:24:43,300 --> 02:24:44,940
Kinect for Windows.

3056
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:46,740
It's gonna be using a new Kinect camera

3057
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:48,260
because before I was like, well, you got to sit

3058
02:24:48,260 --> 02:24:50,720
eight feet away from your damn computer to use this thing.

3059
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:53,040
But no, they're actually gonna include a firmware

3060
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:55,820
that's gonna support a new near mode

3061
02:24:55,820 --> 02:24:57,100
that's designed to see objects

3062
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:59,980
as close as 50 centimeters away from the camera.

3063
02:24:59,980 --> 02:25:04,980
And I guess also they're launching with this

3064
02:25:06,580 --> 02:25:09,580
in early 2012 a Kinect Accelerator program

3065
02:25:09,580 --> 02:25:12,700
which will give $20,000 each to 10 startups

3066
02:25:12,700 --> 02:25:16,860
using Kinect along with Microsoft development tools,

3067
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:19,120
marketing visibility, and mentoring.

3068
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:21,340
So it'll be interesting to see

3069
02:25:21,340 --> 02:25:24,900
what they use Kinect for, you know, the PC.

3070
02:25:24,900 --> 02:25:27,140
And obviously maybe we'll see this integrated

3071
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:31,860
into, you know, like laptops and stuff like that.

3072
02:25:31,860 --> 02:25:35,160
So it might be interesting to see how this evolves.

3073
02:25:37,260 --> 02:25:38,820
One other thing I was gonna mention too

3074
02:25:38,820 --> 02:25:41,620
is kind of a story that we got left out.

3075
02:25:41,620 --> 02:25:45,500
There's a rumor that Microsoft is in the early stages

3076
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:50,500
of licensing with Sony for a Kinect-enabled TV.

3077
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:51,680
And obviously-

3078
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:53,040
Oh yeah, I had heard about that.

3079
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:55,260
Obviously it's supposed to be, I would imagine,

3080
02:25:55,260 --> 02:25:58,420
some sort of like, I don't know,

3081
02:25:58,420 --> 02:26:00,860
maybe some sort of web-enabled TV.

3082
02:26:00,860 --> 02:26:03,100
You know how they have the enhanced TVs now

3083
02:26:04,220 --> 02:26:07,440
where you can browse content online, maybe different apps.

3084
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:10,340
Or maybe that's how you'll browse through movies,

3085
02:26:10,340 --> 02:26:13,900
you know, doing Netflix and that kind of stuff through a TV.

3086
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:16,340
Be interesting to see that actually happen.

3087
02:26:16,340 --> 02:26:18,580
I mean, and also it'd be weird to see Sony

3088
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:21,820
partnering with Microsoft on something, but I don't know.

3089
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:23,700
Well, they're gonna, I mean,

3090
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:25,260
I would think it's somewhat inevitable

3091
02:26:25,260 --> 02:26:28,620
that the next Xbox, whatever we're gonna end up calling it,

3092
02:26:28,620 --> 02:26:30,820
which we'll find out here in a minute,

3093
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:32,340
could have Blu-ray in it.

3094
02:26:32,340 --> 02:26:34,260
Because, you know, it's gonna be able to, I mean,

3095
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:36,860
I would think they'd go with a proprietary disc,

3096
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:38,660
but maybe if it's really supposed to be, you know,

3097
02:26:38,660 --> 02:26:40,520
the whole Netflix-

3098
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:41,460
I would think Blu-ray

3099
02:26:41,460 --> 02:26:43,260
because they're gonna try to get in on that.

3100
02:26:43,260 --> 02:26:44,480
So they're gonna have to kind of partner

3101
02:26:44,480 --> 02:26:45,980
with Sony for that anyway.

3102
02:26:45,980 --> 02:26:47,700
So it could be interesting.

3103
02:26:49,220 --> 02:26:50,180
Could be very interesting.

3104
02:26:50,180 --> 02:26:53,860
Anyway, you give us Blu-ray and we'll give you Kinect.

3105
02:26:53,860 --> 02:26:56,940
Are you interested in Kinect for Windows at all, Loki?

3106
02:26:56,940 --> 02:26:59,580
No, because I work on my laptop mostly.

3107
02:26:59,580 --> 02:27:04,580
So, I mean, hell, I don't use Kinect anyways on my 360.

3108
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:08,320
Did you see that super fuzzy, wuzzy, feel-good commercial

3109
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:11,180
that Xtafer had posted on his Facebook,

3110
02:27:11,180 --> 02:27:13,100
where he's like, I really like the music in this.

3111
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:15,300
Ah, I've seen that before.

3112
02:27:15,300 --> 02:27:17,000
It showed like the doctors using Kinect.

3113
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,280
It was basically an Apple commercial, but with Kinect.

3114
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:22,300
I've seen that before and it's a neat concept

3115
02:27:22,300 --> 02:27:24,800
that they're showing these classrooms enabled

3116
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:28,580
with all this big projection screens and doing stuff.

3117
02:27:28,580 --> 02:27:30,140
It's just like the, what was it,

3118
02:27:30,140 --> 02:27:32,260
Cisco commercials that they have

3119
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:35,780
where there's kids in the US talking to kids in China

3120
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:38,420
through almost like a portal or whatever.

3121
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:43,660
You know, like some sort of webcam projection setup

3122
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:44,900
or whatever that they got.

3123
02:27:44,900 --> 02:27:47,820
But, I mean, I don't know.

3124
02:27:47,820 --> 02:27:50,300
It's a neat idea that they'll eventually do this stuff,

3125
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:53,180
but definitely with Kinect for Windows

3126
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:56,780
and people creating new applications for it.

3127
02:27:56,780 --> 02:27:59,380
I could see more of that stuff coming about,

3128
02:27:59,380 --> 02:28:04,380
but it's too ideal for me.

3129
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:08,900
Idealistic, I guess would be the word.

3130
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:14,620
All right, I'm gonna move on with another story here.

3131
02:28:14,620 --> 02:28:16,900
This is also the very, very, very, very, very last call

3132
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:20,500
for cage, or not cage match, listless votes.

3133
02:28:20,500 --> 02:28:21,700
Cause we're about done.

3134
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:25,300
There's an interesting petition going on out there.

3135
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:26,260
And this is not, okay,

3136
02:28:26,260 --> 02:28:27,860
there's like two things going on right now.

3137
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:29,980
There's a really funny thing going around Facebook,

3138
02:28:29,980 --> 02:28:31,780
which is from like a parody site,

3139
02:28:31,780 --> 02:28:36,760
which is about how Xbox is turning everybody gay

3140
02:28:36,760 --> 02:28:37,940
and all this stuff, or not Xbox,

3141
02:28:37,940 --> 02:28:40,020
Skyrim is turning everybody gay and all this stuff.

3142
02:28:40,020 --> 02:28:40,860
And it promotes the-

3143
02:28:40,860 --> 02:28:42,300
You mean Skyrim job?

3144
02:28:42,300 --> 02:28:43,480
Exactly, something like that.

3145
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:45,180
That was a really funny parody article

3146
02:28:45,180 --> 02:28:46,780
is on like Christwire or something like that.

3147
02:28:46,780 --> 02:28:49,680
It's like a onion site for religious sites.

3148
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:51,580
But anyway, what I really wanna share

3149
02:28:51,580 --> 02:28:52,940
is this is actually a serious thing.

3150
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:54,580
This is a White House petition.

3151
02:28:54,580 --> 02:28:56,860
Cause you know the whitehouse.gov website

3152
02:28:56,860 --> 02:28:58,480
will let you do your own petition.

3153
02:28:58,480 --> 02:29:00,780
And somebody actually started one on there,

3154
02:29:00,780 --> 02:29:05,780
urging the president to ban the Elder Scrolls Skyrim

3155
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:09,620
for the safety of America's youths.

3156
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:11,880
There were five backers that signed the petition

3157
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:15,020
at the time this was posted around gaming blogs.

3158
02:29:15,020 --> 02:29:17,180
Of course, tons more people have signed it as a joke

3159
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:19,140
or whatever after that.

3160
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:23,440
But yeah, it's basically petitioning the Obama administration.

3161
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:24,280
Let me read this.

3162
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:26,920
Quote, immediately banned the deadly video game

3163
02:29:26,920 --> 02:29:29,900
known as Skyrim for the safety of America's youths.

3164
02:29:29,900 --> 02:29:32,100
Whereas video gaming has proven to cause social,

3165
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:34,340
ethical, and health problems in people of all ages.

3166
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:35,180
No it's not.

3167
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:37,760
Whereas sexual perversion and homosexuality

3168
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:39,900
are threatening to destroy the Christian foundations

3169
02:29:39,900 --> 02:29:41,460
on which this nation was built.

3170
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:44,260
Did you hear that?

3171
02:29:44,260 --> 02:29:47,060
Your relationship is threatening America.

3172
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:47,900
You know what?

3173
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:49,900
Do you feel threatened by my relationship?

3174
02:29:49,900 --> 02:29:50,860
Girl, no.

3175
02:29:51,740 --> 02:29:53,020
Well you should be threatened.

3176
02:29:53,020 --> 02:29:54,020
Dance is a little bit.

3177
02:29:54,020 --> 02:29:55,360
He knows how to cook.

3178
02:29:56,700 --> 02:29:57,560
Anyhow.

3179
02:29:57,560 --> 02:29:58,760
I'm not totally not threatened

3180
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:01,180
cause I want to come over for dinner.

3181
02:30:01,180 --> 02:30:03,280
Whereas a new video game has just been created

3182
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:05,500
that far exceeds any others in the psychological

3183
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:08,740
and spiritual damage it does to teens.

3184
02:30:08,740 --> 02:30:12,060
We ask you to ban Skyrim blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3185
02:30:12,060 --> 02:30:17,060
I guess this petition may have actually been created

3186
02:30:17,580 --> 02:30:19,720
by that same parody website.

3187
02:30:20,700 --> 02:30:22,380
But whatever, it's still interesting

3188
02:30:22,380 --> 02:30:23,980
that you can post this out there

3189
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:25,740
and that it is on the official White House site.

3190
02:30:25,740 --> 02:30:27,860
And I bet you people signed that

3191
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:29,580
not knowing that it was parody.

3192
02:30:29,580 --> 02:30:30,660
I bet a lot of people signed it

3193
02:30:30,660 --> 02:30:32,420
not knowing if it really was parody.

3194
02:30:32,420 --> 02:30:33,580
They didn't really know that.

3195
02:30:33,580 --> 02:30:34,740
That's just sad.

3196
02:30:34,740 --> 02:30:35,620
Yeah.

3197
02:30:35,620 --> 02:30:40,620
So I want to create a petition banning online petitions.

3198
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:42,340
How's that sound?

3199
02:30:42,340 --> 02:30:43,180
Cool.

3200
02:30:43,180 --> 02:30:44,240
If you want a petition for something,

3201
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:47,000
you go stand outside of a Walmart and get signatures.

3202
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:50,840
I'd be like, hey, well, you know,

3203
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:52,680
they did that on an episode of bullshit.

3204
02:30:52,680 --> 02:30:53,520
Did they?

3205
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:58,520
About misguided patriotism and how people,

3206
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:00,680
if they hear certain keywords,

3207
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:02,480
will sign just about anything.

3208
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:03,480
I mean, but then again, they did.

3209
02:31:03,480 --> 02:31:04,620
Protect children.

3210
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:06,840
Yeah, but they actually did show

3211
02:31:06,840 --> 02:31:10,000
that it was actually the majority of people

3212
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,960
who I think wouldn't actually sign it

3213
02:31:11,960 --> 02:31:14,280
because they stopped to think about it.

3214
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:16,480
But then again, they also had a petition out

3215
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:21,480
at a Greenpeace rally to ban H2O.

3216
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:24,640
Oh yeah.

3217
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:25,960
I think I remember something like that.

3218
02:31:25,960 --> 02:31:30,840
Like it was like ban chemical name and it was like water.

3219
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:31,680
Yeah.

3220
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:32,520
Yeah.

3221
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:33,340
Or soda or something like that.

3222
02:31:33,340 --> 02:31:34,340
It was water.

3223
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:35,180
Was it?

3224
02:31:35,180 --> 02:31:36,560
But they were like, it's dangerous chemical

3225
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:38,640
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3226
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:39,800
Gotcha.

3227
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:41,080
Interesting.

3228
02:31:41,080 --> 02:31:41,920
All right.

3229
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:43,400
One more story from you, DarkSakura.

3230
02:31:43,400 --> 02:31:45,360
And then it's almost time for the tweets.

3231
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:46,640
Like dihydrogenoxide.

3232
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:48,400
At twitter.com slash O-L-R.

3233
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:50,520
Hydrogen dioxide.

3234
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:51,360
All right.

3235
02:31:52,680 --> 02:31:53,520
I'm being dumb.

3236
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:54,440
Okay.

3237
02:31:54,440 --> 02:31:55,840
So I have another article.

3238
02:31:56,780 --> 02:31:58,040
Google Chrome.

3239
02:31:58,040 --> 02:31:59,960
Yay, Google Chrome.

3240
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:03,240
Well, it's actually going to be adding in

3241
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:05,720
more hardware support to the browser,

3242
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:07,680
including using a game pad.

3243
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:12,680
So not only will you be able to, you know, play your games,

3244
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:15,900
you can play your games with your actual game pad.

3245
02:32:15,900 --> 02:32:18,680
And that means it's going to be, you know,

3246
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:22,360
a lot more of these web only games

3247
02:32:22,360 --> 02:32:24,600
or it should actually start being easier to play.

3248
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:27,240
I mean, we might see a bit more development for, you know,

3249
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:28,400
true console style games.

3250
02:32:28,400 --> 02:32:31,200
I mean, we've already got a lot of NES games

3251
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:32,940
emulated in flash.

3252
02:32:32,940 --> 02:32:33,840
We might see more.

3253
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:38,840
And I like the idea of game pads in browsers,

3254
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:40,780
but that's just going to lead to even more

3255
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:43,680
of the emulation websites stuff.

3256
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:44,520
There's a little bit more.

3257
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:45,360
Yeah.

3258
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:50,280
Google's actually going to put in support for web RTC,

3259
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:53,480
which is a video chat thing,

3260
02:32:53,480 --> 02:32:56,640
but Firefox already has game pad support for the record.

3261
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:58,440
Can I actually say that I do really like though,

3262
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:01,720
that, you know, we had a story last week or the week before

3263
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:04,800
or whenever we had a show about how, like,

3264
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:07,560
you can get demos for games through YouTube now,

3265
02:33:07,560 --> 02:33:08,920
like there was that FIFA game.

3266
02:33:08,920 --> 02:33:10,800
Like, so it would make a lot of sense

3267
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:13,420
that game pads will be enabled within the browser

3268
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:14,880
because like a lot of stuff seems like

3269
02:33:14,880 --> 02:33:16,920
it's going to be streaming like right through your browser

3270
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:19,320
and shit, people play the Facebook games

3271
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:23,200
and probably a Google Plus game is looking at using this

3272
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:24,620
if Google Chrome is launching it.

3273
02:33:24,620 --> 02:33:27,680
So it's interesting.

3274
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:29,520
But yeah, that's that kind of support.

3275
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:30,760
I can support.

3276
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:32,400
Ha.

3277
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:33,600
All right.

3278
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:34,660
Let's see.

3279
02:33:34,660 --> 02:33:37,560
We're about to get to the Twitter and last minute stories,

3280
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:39,600
but I think we should do some listless results.

3281
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:41,340
Shouldn't we find out what we're going to be calling

3282
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:43,280
the new Xbox officially?

3283
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:44,120
Well, yeah.

3284
02:33:44,120 --> 02:33:46,680
Cause you know, after tonight, it's no more Xbox 720.

3285
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:48,360
We will be calling it by this name.

3286
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:50,640
The bend over and take it like a man.

3287
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:51,620
Let's find out.

3288
02:33:51,620 --> 02:33:54,880
Let's see if, let's see who got their way.

3289
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:59,880
In at number three is a tie.

3290
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:05,120
Number three answer for what we should call the new system.

3291
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:09,680
The Xbox 420 as you know, we have a few stoners in our chat

3292
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:13,960
and the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.

3293
02:34:13,960 --> 02:34:15,160
Yeah.

3294
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:17,340
Tied for your number three answer.

3295
02:34:17,340 --> 02:34:20,440
The number two thing you most want to call the new Xbox

3296
02:34:20,440 --> 02:34:24,920
is the Xbox non-silon occupied Caprica.

3297
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:26,880
Yay.

3298
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:30,360
And the number one answer, can I put it this way?

3299
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:33,320
It got twice as many votes as the number two answer.

3300
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:34,440
The number one answer.

3301
02:34:34,440 --> 02:34:39,440
The Xbox lube is the official name of the new Xbox console.

3302
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:42,360
Congratulations, chatters.

3303
02:34:42,360 --> 02:34:45,960
Congratulations, Microsoft and the Xbox lube.

3304
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:47,560
Do you think you can handle it?

3305
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:51,440
I think it should be bend over and take it like a man.

3306
02:34:52,480 --> 02:34:55,440
Very, very narrowly missing the list by the way.

3307
02:34:55,440 --> 02:34:57,320
Waiters didn't make the top three.

3308
02:34:57,320 --> 02:34:58,440
Did you notice that?

3309
02:34:58,440 --> 02:34:59,840
That's poopy.

3310
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:02,240
Even after my Harvey Fierstein impersonation,

3311
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:03,360
Waiters missed the list.

3312
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:04,320
I think that might've hurt it.

3313
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:05,160
That might've hurt.

3314
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:06,640
You're right, it might've hurt its chances.

3315
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:09,160
They were raised badly.

3316
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:10,880
Their mothers didn't do their job.

3317
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:13,340
All right, so there it is.

3318
02:35:13,340 --> 02:35:16,820
The Xbox lube is the official new title of the Xbox console.

3319
02:35:16,820 --> 02:35:18,440
And here on the show, here in chat,

3320
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:20,680
and hopefully soon across the entirety of the internet.

3321
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:22,440
Can we call it the X Blube?

3322
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:23,680
Sure, we can call it the X Blube

3323
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:27,760
and other fun creations there will be Xbox lube.

3324
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:31,040
All right, let's get to last minute stories.

3325
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:32,080
I don't know, again,

3326
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:33,680
we were in an interesting situation this week

3327
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:36,620
because we lost the usual way we prepped the show.

3328
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:37,880
So does anybody have anything they want to add?

3329
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:39,560
Dark soccer, were there any stories

3330
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:41,280
that you wanted to get to that we didn't?

3331
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:42,520
No, not really.

3332
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:44,460
Well, actually, hold on, there was one.

3333
02:35:44,460 --> 02:35:45,300
There was one.

3334
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:46,120
Loki do one.

3335
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:48,920
Hopefully it's not the same story or you're screwed.

3336
02:35:48,920 --> 02:35:51,000
South Korea has put it into effect

3337
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,640
what they're calling the Cinderella law.

3338
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:58,040
Basically, they're working with their internet providers

3339
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:01,320
that they're going to block players from under 16

3340
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:07,200
from playing between midnight and 6 a.m.

3341
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:11,000
on online services such as PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.

3342
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:13,880
What?

3343
02:36:13,880 --> 02:36:15,640
It is in Korea.

3344
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:18,320
Well, didn't they ban MMOs too?

3345
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:19,160
Yes, they did.

3346
02:36:19,160 --> 02:36:20,120
Was that South or North that did that?

3347
02:36:20,120 --> 02:36:21,560
South Korea.

3348
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:23,080
Okay.

3349
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:25,220
Okay, I've got a couple.

3350
02:36:25,220 --> 02:36:27,960
One of them is that Microsoft bought a video surf

3351
02:36:27,960 --> 02:36:29,560
to use on Xbox Live.

3352
02:36:29,560 --> 02:36:30,800
Interesting, what's video surf do?

3353
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:32,800
It's a search engine,

3354
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:37,040
but it's saying that the overtime technology,

3355
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:39,640
it says it's supposed to be integrated with Xbox Live

3356
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:43,720
and that you can use it to search for TV film

3357
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:46,680
across several Xbox Live applications,

3358
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:49,820
left film, zoom, et cetera.

3359
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:54,360
The U.S. will, okay, in the UK,

3360
02:36:54,360 --> 02:36:57,380
they're getting BBC content

3361
02:36:57,380 --> 02:37:00,000
and the U.S. will get Bravo, Comcast, HBO Go,

3362
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,480
Verizon, FiOS and sci-fi.

3363
02:37:02,480 --> 02:37:04,400
Wait, wait, wait, we're going to get Bravo?

3364
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:05,240
Yeah.

3365
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:07,760
I know, I was like.

3366
02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:11,640
I can't wait for the Real Housewives of,

3367
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:13,840
you know, Boulder, Colorado

3368
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:15,560
or wherever they're going to go next.

3369
02:37:15,560 --> 02:37:18,240
And then, you probably said something about this

3370
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:19,840
on Hoard House.

3371
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:21,120
Yes, I did, go ahead.

3372
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:24,100
Yeah, about the talent calculator being live

3373
02:37:24,100 --> 02:37:25,780
for Mista Pandaria.

3374
02:37:25,780 --> 02:37:27,920
Or as I call it, MOP.

3375
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:30,120
Which is notable because the game itself

3376
02:37:30,120 --> 02:37:32,280
shouldn't be out for at least another six months,

3377
02:37:32,280 --> 02:37:34,000
if not more like nine to 12.

3378
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,520
So it's interesting that the talent calculator

3379
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:36,480
is already out there.

3380
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:40,940
So you can see how talented you want to be at MOPing.

3381
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:41,780
There you go.

3382
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:43,720
Loki?

3383
02:37:43,720 --> 02:37:46,080
Oh, the calculator for Monk is not available.

3384
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:48,240
Right, because they don't want to give everything away.

3385
02:37:48,240 --> 02:37:49,080
Yeah.

3386
02:37:50,080 --> 02:37:50,920
Loki.

3387
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:51,760
A few things.

3388
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:54,500
There was supposed to be a lawsuit against EA

3389
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:58,960
for reneging on the fact that Battlefield 1943

3390
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:03,500
didn't come with Battlefield 3 or something like that.

3391
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:07,280
So now they're going to be giving away.

3392
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:08,720
The other way around, by the way.

3393
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:10,040
Whatever.

3394
02:38:10,040 --> 02:38:13,880
They're going to be giving away Battlefield 1943 vouchers

3395
02:38:13,880 --> 02:38:16,680
to everybody that bought the PlayStation 3

3396
02:38:16,680 --> 02:38:18,400
version of Battlefield 3.

3397
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:21,940
And to redeem this, you have to go to their portal,

3398
02:38:21,940 --> 02:38:26,180
which is 1943redemption.battlefield.com

3399
02:38:26,180 --> 02:38:29,720
with your origin ID and request a download code

3400
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:30,920
for your region.

3401
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:33,540
And codes will be available for European customers

3402
02:38:33,540 --> 02:38:36,200
as soon as, well, November 26th.

3403
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:37,820
So they should already be available.

3404
02:38:37,820 --> 02:38:41,980
And Americans, you'll have to wait until the 10th

3405
02:38:41,980 --> 02:38:45,140
of December before those are available.

3406
02:38:47,440 --> 02:38:49,760
So that's good that they finally came through with that.

3407
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:51,680
Unfortunately, it took a lot to do that.

3408
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:53,280
And I'm not sure if we reported on this before,

3409
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:55,320
but same thing happened with Saints Row the Third.

3410
02:38:55,320 --> 02:38:56,800
They were supposed to be getting an exclusive content

3411
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:58,200
for Saints Row the Third.

3412
02:38:58,200 --> 02:39:00,360
And THQ came now.

3413
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:05,360
If you sign up, if you log in your online pass

3414
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:08,640
that comes with the new copies of Saints Row the Third,

3415
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:11,280
or if you buy the game and buy the online pass,

3416
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:13,560
you know, if you buy the game used and buy the online pass,

3417
02:39:13,560 --> 02:39:16,720
as long as you redeem that pass by,

3418
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:18,120
I forget what the time frame is,

3419
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:21,800
you get a free copy or a free download of Saints Row 2

3420
02:39:21,800 --> 02:39:24,620
on the PlayStation 3, which is pretty awesome.

3421
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:27,280
So definitely worth checking that out.

3422
02:39:28,600 --> 02:39:31,080
Cthulhu Saves the World Bundle has sold

3423
02:39:31,080 --> 02:39:33,280
100,000 copies on Steam.

3424
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:36,560
How many did they sell on Xbox Live Arcade or indie games?

3425
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:40,400
Indie games, they have only moved 55,000 to date.

3426
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:46,160
And that's been available since December 2010.

3427
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:48,520
Sadly, that's still more than I would have thought.

3428
02:39:48,520 --> 02:39:51,060
And, actually, wait a second here.

3429
02:39:51,060 --> 02:39:55,180
I'm sorry, Breath of Death, Breath of Death 7,

3430
02:39:55,180 --> 02:39:59,620
has been available since April 2010 on Xbox Live indie games

3431
02:39:59,620 --> 02:40:02,680
and has moved 55,000 copies to date.

3432
02:40:02,680 --> 02:40:05,400
Cthulhu Saves the World has been available

3433
02:40:05,400 --> 02:40:10,400
since December 2010 and has only generated 20,000 downloads.

3434
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:11,760
Yikes.

3435
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:15,560
And apparently, I don't know when it went up on Steam,

3436
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:20,560
but they sold 100,000 copies.

3437
02:40:20,600 --> 02:40:22,360
Oh, since July.

3438
02:40:22,360 --> 02:40:23,880
July.

3439
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:25,160
So, yeah.

3440
02:40:25,160 --> 02:40:26,280
Big difference there.

3441
02:40:26,280 --> 02:40:27,960
Apparently their next title that they're working on

3442
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:32,060
is actually was the once canceled Penny Arcade Adventures

3443
02:40:32,060 --> 02:40:36,240
on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness, episode three.

3444
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:37,840
Oh, interesting.

3445
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:39,600
So these guys picked it up.

3446
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:40,440
Yeah.

3447
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:42,440
So it's interesting.

3448
02:40:43,360 --> 02:40:47,040
Also, what's also interesting, Elder Scrolls Skyrim

3449
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:52,040
has much of the, I guess, land of Tamriel from, was it?

3450
02:40:54,340 --> 02:40:57,000
Yeah, there was a video of that up of the guy,

3451
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:57,840
no clipping, right?

3452
02:40:57,840 --> 02:40:59,880
Yeah, from Morrowind.

3453
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:02,000
And people are assuming that's just from,

3454
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:05,720
because the way they display the map or whatever,

3455
02:41:05,720 --> 02:41:07,560
that they just want it to be complete.

3456
02:41:08,960 --> 02:41:10,560
Well, it's still neat either way.

3457
02:41:12,640 --> 02:41:15,280
And of course, Skyrim got a patch on PC,

3458
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:18,920
but what's kind of annoying is that they added

3459
02:41:18,920 --> 02:41:22,600
mandatory Steam DRM and they've also killed

3460
02:41:22,600 --> 02:41:25,560
some of the tweaks that you can do in the game.

3461
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:27,180
So that kind of sucks.

3462
02:41:27,180 --> 02:41:31,940
And then last but not least,

3463
02:41:31,940 --> 02:41:34,340
new dashboard update for the Xbox 360

3464
02:41:34,340 --> 02:41:36,220
has been dated for December 6th.

3465
02:41:36,220 --> 02:41:38,200
Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of big news we missed, huh?

3466
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:41,160
And that of course will be bringing cloud storage

3467
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:43,420
as well as the beacon support,

3468
02:41:43,420 --> 02:41:46,460
which is I believe live already on Xbox.com.

3469
02:41:46,460 --> 02:41:47,820
Isn't that kind of like the,

3470
02:41:47,820 --> 02:41:50,500
don't you want to play these games with me type of thing?

3471
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:52,620
Yeah, like you go, hey, I'm playing Call of Duty

3472
02:41:52,620 --> 02:41:54,700
later today, and so you can see that.

3473
02:41:54,700 --> 02:41:55,620
That's kind of cool, I guess.

3474
02:41:55,620 --> 02:41:58,300
Something, so they have that.

3475
02:41:58,300 --> 02:41:59,780
And then also of course the redesign

3476
02:41:59,780 --> 02:42:01,700
to make it look like Windows Phone 7.

3477
02:42:03,580 --> 02:42:04,940
Let's open up the Skype line.

3478
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:06,220
We're ready to take your calls.

3479
02:42:06,220 --> 02:42:09,780
1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number,

3480
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:11,300
or you can look us up on Skype.

3481
02:42:11,300 --> 02:42:14,340
Username is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

3482
02:42:14,340 --> 02:42:17,860
877 number is free in the US and Canada, toll free.

3483
02:42:17,860 --> 02:42:19,860
Can't say the same everywhere else,

3484
02:42:19,860 --> 02:42:23,260
so definitely use Skype if you're somewhere else.

3485
02:42:23,260 --> 02:42:25,860
OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, all one word.

3486
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:28,420
Meanwhile, we have just a couple of tweets for you.

3487
02:42:28,420 --> 02:42:31,140
We didn't get a whole lot tonight, but just a couple.

3488
02:42:31,140 --> 02:42:34,580
We'll start here with a link from TigerClaw on Twitter.

3489
02:42:34,580 --> 02:42:36,420
Send us a reminder.

3490
02:42:36,420 --> 02:42:37,420
I did read about this earlier.

3491
02:42:37,420 --> 02:42:38,440
I didn't make the show roll tonight,

3492
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:41,100
but he reminds us just in time for Christmas,

3493
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:44,900
the Batcave will be Arkham City's newest challenge map.

3494
02:42:44,900 --> 02:42:46,680
So there is gonna be some DLC that hits,

3495
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:48,580
and I think the date was December 20th.

3496
02:42:48,580 --> 02:42:51,060
Yeah, December 20th is gonna be a new DLC pack.

3497
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:53,220
Of course, this is for Arkham City,

3498
02:42:53,220 --> 02:42:56,020
and it's actually gonna be a Batcave challenge map.

3499
02:42:56,020 --> 02:42:58,820
It's also gonna contain the Iceberg Lounge

3500
02:42:58,820 --> 02:43:00,420
and Joker's Carnival.

3501
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:03,180
So yeah, that's gonna be coming out December 20th.

3502
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:06,860
Didn't the Robin pack hit this week?

3503
02:43:06,860 --> 02:43:08,100
Yeah.

3504
02:43:08,100 --> 02:43:09,340
Gotta check that out,

3505
02:43:09,340 --> 02:43:11,900
because yeah, I don't know much about

3506
02:43:11,900 --> 02:43:13,380
what's supposed to be in that Robin pack,

3507
02:43:13,380 --> 02:43:14,580
except well, of course, Robin.

3508
02:43:14,580 --> 02:43:15,540
You can play as Robin.

3509
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:16,820
Yeah, and they have some challenge maps also.

3510
02:43:16,820 --> 02:43:18,660
I wonder if they integrate him into the story,

3511
02:43:18,660 --> 02:43:19,540
like they do Catwoman.

3512
02:43:19,540 --> 02:43:22,220
I think he's supposed to be integrated into the story.

3513
02:43:22,220 --> 02:43:23,060
That's kind of rad.

3514
02:43:23,060 --> 02:43:24,980
I might have to check that out, so.

3515
02:43:26,420 --> 02:43:29,140
All right, again, the phone is open 1-877-GAME-OLR,

3516
02:43:29,140 --> 02:43:32,460
or as your name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

3517
02:43:32,460 --> 02:43:35,460
We are getting a call, so let's go to the phones.

3518
02:43:35,460 --> 02:43:36,780
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3519
02:43:36,780 --> 02:43:37,620
Who's this?

3520
02:43:38,660 --> 02:43:40,040
Well, it's Jester Scott.

3521
02:43:40,040 --> 02:43:42,060
Jester Scott, welcome to the show.

3522
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:44,680
Hi.

3523
02:43:44,680 --> 02:43:46,780
Hi, what's on your mind, buddy?

3524
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:49,620
I had a couple of things.

3525
02:43:49,620 --> 02:43:51,100
I think that you were talking about

3526
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:54,100
the GameStop stickers one time,

3527
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:55,480
how they've gotten a little bit better

3528
02:43:55,480 --> 02:43:56,640
from being so sticky.

3529
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:02,740
Well, I bought Zelda on Sunday, of course,

3530
02:44:02,740 --> 02:44:04,220
I bought the collector's edition,

3531
02:44:04,220 --> 02:44:06,140
and it had this giant sticker on it.

3532
02:44:06,140 --> 02:44:08,180
Oh, wait, okay, wait, you're talking about

3533
02:44:08,180 --> 02:44:10,220
how they will seal up a used,

3534
02:44:10,220 --> 02:44:12,140
or the ones that were opened,

3535
02:44:12,140 --> 02:44:13,860
or like their last copy or whatever,

3536
02:44:13,860 --> 02:44:15,340
with those big stickers,

3537
02:44:15,340 --> 02:44:18,180
and I think you were saying something about this, Loki,

3538
02:44:18,180 --> 02:44:19,580
like you used to be able to kind of

3539
02:44:19,580 --> 02:44:21,700
very carefully take those things off,

3540
02:44:21,700 --> 02:44:22,580
and you could put it back on.

3541
02:44:22,580 --> 02:44:24,000
Somebody was, I think we had a guest,

3542
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:24,840
or somebody was saying something about that.

3543
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:26,500
No, that wasn't me.

3544
02:44:26,500 --> 02:44:27,700
Maybe it was another podcast,

3545
02:44:27,700 --> 02:44:29,420
but I know I've heard that before.

3546
02:44:29,420 --> 02:44:30,700
So, okay, I see where you're going.

3547
02:44:30,700 --> 02:44:32,500
At first, I was like, GameStop stickers, what?

3548
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:34,060
Okay, I get where you're going with this.

3549
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:36,020
Okay, so you just bought Zelda, sorry.

3550
02:44:37,100 --> 02:44:39,760
Right, well, normally the new stickers

3551
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:41,140
can come off very easily now,

3552
02:44:41,140 --> 02:44:43,460
instead of leaving that sticky residue, right?

3553
02:44:43,460 --> 02:44:44,360
Yeah.

3554
02:44:44,360 --> 02:44:46,500
Well, I go to take off my sticker

3555
02:44:46,500 --> 02:44:49,060
on the Zelda copy that I got.

3556
02:44:49,060 --> 02:44:51,120
Well, the front of it's foil.

3557
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:52,980
Guess what came off?

3558
02:44:52,980 --> 02:44:53,820
The foil.

3559
02:44:53,820 --> 02:44:54,660
The entire foil.

3560
02:44:54,660 --> 02:44:55,940
The foil came off.

3561
02:44:55,940 --> 02:44:58,860
So the new stickers are not so awesome.

3562
02:44:58,860 --> 02:45:01,020
It's in my eyes anymore.

3563
02:45:01,020 --> 02:45:02,280
Well, you know what that means.

3564
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:04,060
They were onto our schemes.

3565
02:45:04,060 --> 02:45:05,940
They started reading the internet,

3566
02:45:05,940 --> 02:45:08,100
and they knew that people were just opening them

3567
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:11,100
and then trying to return them like they were new.

3568
02:45:11,100 --> 02:45:12,060
But you know why?

3569
02:45:12,060 --> 02:45:17,060
They deserve it for that crappy policy anyway, so.

3570
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:19,700
But whatever.

3571
02:45:19,700 --> 02:45:21,820
I don't even know why mine had a sticker

3572
02:45:21,820 --> 02:45:24,060
on it in the first place, I pre-ordered it.

3573
02:45:25,060 --> 02:45:27,140
Wait, you had actually pre-ordered Zelda

3574
02:45:27,140 --> 02:45:29,560
and you still got a copy like that?

3575
02:45:29,560 --> 02:45:30,400
Yep.

3576
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:32,460
It wasn't in the shrink wrap?

3577
02:45:32,460 --> 02:45:33,800
Oh, no, no, no.

3578
02:45:33,800 --> 02:45:34,900
It was sealed and everything,

3579
02:45:34,900 --> 02:45:36,620
just still had that big ass sticker

3580
02:45:36,620 --> 02:45:37,820
on the front of the box.

3581
02:45:38,940 --> 02:45:41,620
Oh, so now when you took it off,

3582
02:45:41,620 --> 02:45:43,180
like, now your box has it

3583
02:45:43,180 --> 02:45:46,740
and you won't be able to sell it on eBay or anything, huh?

3584
02:45:46,740 --> 02:45:47,560
No.

3585
02:45:47,560 --> 02:45:48,900
Well, I wasn't gonna sell it anyway.

3586
02:45:48,900 --> 02:45:50,620
It's just an eye store.

3587
02:45:50,620 --> 02:45:53,140
So they had a sticker underneath the shrink wrap?

3588
02:45:54,180 --> 02:45:55,740
No, no, no.

3589
02:45:55,740 --> 02:46:00,740
The box to Zelda has a case inside of the box.

3590
02:46:00,940 --> 02:46:03,300
You're talking about the collector's edition,

3591
02:46:03,300 --> 02:46:05,020
or it had a slip sleeve like the,

3592
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:07,820
now was it the one with the remote?

3593
02:46:07,820 --> 02:46:11,540
It was kind of like the 25th anniversary for Mario.

3594
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:13,860
The whole box didn't have a flap.

3595
02:46:15,740 --> 02:46:16,580
I getcha.

3596
02:46:18,020 --> 02:46:19,460
Yeah, the front of that foil

3597
02:46:19,460 --> 02:46:23,460
and the big old sticker they had on it took off the foil.

3598
02:46:23,460 --> 02:46:25,740
Well, let me go this direction

3599
02:46:25,740 --> 02:46:27,900
because you've actually played the new Zelda then,

3600
02:46:27,900 --> 02:46:28,720
which is something,

3601
02:46:28,720 --> 02:46:30,120
despite all the other games that are out right now,

3602
02:46:30,120 --> 02:46:31,540
we haven't had a chance to play.

3603
02:46:31,540 --> 02:46:33,940
How do you like the new Zelda game?

3604
02:46:33,940 --> 02:46:36,300
Oh my God.

3605
02:46:36,300 --> 02:46:38,220
I think it's amazing.

3606
02:46:38,220 --> 02:46:39,460
Yeah?

3607
02:46:39,460 --> 02:46:41,640
Yes, the controls are a little finicky.

3608
02:46:42,740 --> 02:46:43,660
You have to get used to it

3609
02:46:43,660 --> 02:46:46,720
because it fully uses the Wii Motion Plus

3610
02:46:46,720 --> 02:46:48,540
or motion controls, whatever it is.

3611
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:53,540
It goes in a different direction.

3612
02:46:53,540 --> 02:46:55,260
Yes, the graphics are a little toned down,

3613
02:46:55,260 --> 02:46:58,100
but the game is very, very long.

3614
02:46:58,100 --> 02:46:58,940
How do you-

3615
02:46:58,940 --> 02:47:00,140
I've passed 30 hours into it

3616
02:47:00,140 --> 02:47:02,500
and either I really suck

3617
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:04,740
or this game is extremely long.

3618
02:47:05,940 --> 02:47:09,300
How is it different from Twilight Princess?

3619
02:47:09,300 --> 02:47:10,260
What would you say?

3620
02:47:11,340 --> 02:47:13,660
Well, I didn't play very much of Twilight Princess.

3621
02:47:13,660 --> 02:47:14,820
I know, gamer shame.

3622
02:47:16,820 --> 02:47:20,380
But I don't know.

3623
02:47:20,380 --> 02:47:23,580
It's just like anytime you move your arm

3624
02:47:23,580 --> 02:47:25,920
or anything that,

3625
02:47:27,100 --> 02:47:29,420
any move you make with your Wiimote,

3626
02:47:30,500 --> 02:47:33,220
link on the screen will make that movement.

3627
02:47:33,220 --> 02:47:35,300
And it's kind of funny

3628
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:39,420
because if you're sitting down playing Zelda

3629
02:47:39,420 --> 02:47:41,860
and he kind of holds his sword out,

3630
02:47:41,860 --> 02:47:43,540
he looks retarded on the screen.

3631
02:47:43,540 --> 02:47:44,900
He's just running around with his sword

3632
02:47:44,900 --> 02:47:46,500
just kind of straight up in the air,

3633
02:47:46,500 --> 02:47:48,500
straight in front of him.

3634
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:53,020
So, but it will just mimic the movement of your hand,

3635
02:47:53,020 --> 02:47:53,860
literally.

3636
02:47:53,860 --> 02:47:55,900
So it sounds like the Wii Motion Plus

3637
02:47:55,900 --> 02:47:57,380
really added a lot more

3638
02:47:57,380 --> 02:47:59,140
than maybe sometimes we give it credit for.

3639
02:47:59,140 --> 02:48:01,840
The extra technology really kind of added a lot to it.

3640
02:48:01,840 --> 02:48:05,120
Yeah, and I've been reading a little bit of hate

3641
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:06,360
of that online.

3642
02:48:06,360 --> 02:48:08,880
You know, like, oh, well, but it's Zelda.

3643
02:48:08,880 --> 02:48:10,940
Why can't they just do it for a controller?

3644
02:48:10,940 --> 02:48:12,360
Well, if you think about it,

3645
02:48:12,360 --> 02:48:13,480
with every Zelda game,

3646
02:48:13,480 --> 02:48:15,640
well, nearly every Zelda game,

3647
02:48:15,640 --> 02:48:17,240
they've done something different.

3648
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:22,160
So, I mean, the first one was that top view.

3649
02:48:22,160 --> 02:48:24,560
The second one had a top view,

3650
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:26,960
but it would also go into side scrolling.

3651
02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:30,520
So, I mean, just keep going from there.

3652
02:48:30,520 --> 02:48:33,640
Besides, most of the guys playing this game,

3653
02:48:33,640 --> 02:48:35,880
their right hand should be in fine shape anyway

3654
02:48:35,880 --> 02:48:37,480
to wag it around, right?

3655
02:48:38,620 --> 02:48:39,460
Yeah.

3656
02:48:39,460 --> 02:48:40,280
All right.

3657
02:48:40,280 --> 02:48:41,120
Well, buddy, I'm gonna let you go

3658
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:41,960
so we can get some more calls,

3659
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:44,780
but thanks so much for the call and enjoy Zelda, okay?

3660
02:48:44,780 --> 02:48:45,620
Oh, that one.

3661
02:48:45,620 --> 02:48:46,680
All right, have a good one.

3662
02:48:47,840 --> 02:48:50,360
Later, 1877 game OLR,

3663
02:48:50,360 --> 02:48:52,240
or a username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.

3664
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:53,240
I think that was a new caller.

3665
02:48:53,240 --> 02:48:54,400
I don't recognize that name.

3666
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:55,680
I recognize it from chat right now,

3667
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:57,880
but I don't think that person's called in before.

3668
02:48:57,880 --> 02:49:00,560
I heard a little Southern accent, didn't you?

3669
02:49:00,560 --> 02:49:01,400
Yeah, a little.

3670
02:49:01,400 --> 02:49:02,220
I heard a little.

3671
02:49:02,220 --> 02:49:03,060
All right.

3672
02:49:03,060 --> 02:49:05,480
Anyhow, moving on, going back to the Twitters.

3673
02:49:05,480 --> 02:49:07,100
Dark Tetsuya sent us a tweet.

3674
02:49:07,100 --> 02:49:11,220
Coming soon to Xbox Live Indie Games, Nyan Cat Adventure.

3675
02:49:11,220 --> 02:49:14,440
It is from the people behind Techno Kitten Adventure.

3676
02:49:14,440 --> 02:49:18,200
I guess they are actually creating a Nyan Cat game.

3677
02:49:19,360 --> 02:49:22,520
There's already a Nyan Cat game for iPhone.

3678
02:49:22,520 --> 02:49:23,400
There is an iPhone,

3679
02:49:23,400 --> 02:49:26,120
but I guess this is the official quote unquote one

3680
02:49:26,120 --> 02:49:29,320
that's going to be on Xbox Live.

3681
02:49:29,320 --> 02:49:30,920
And I like the little box art.

3682
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:32,180
They have a Facebook

3683
02:49:32,180 --> 02:49:33,980
that has some limited pictures and stuff,

3684
02:49:33,980 --> 02:49:36,440
but I love what they did at the bottom.

3685
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:39,760
They made this rip off of the Nintendo seal of quality,

3686
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:43,480
and it's the official Nyan-tendo seal.

3687
02:49:44,780 --> 02:49:47,440
I hope they get that by the Xbox sensors.

3688
02:49:48,420 --> 02:49:49,460
Nyan-tendo.

3689
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:52,960
1877 game OLR,

3690
02:49:52,960 --> 02:49:56,160
or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

3691
02:49:57,120 --> 02:50:00,440
Let's see, more tweets.

3692
02:50:00,440 --> 02:50:03,200
Oh, I like this one from Mantis Knight on Twitter.

3693
02:50:04,240 --> 02:50:08,040
One topic please discuss is,

3694
02:50:08,040 --> 02:50:11,880
is free to play MMORPGs really a good thing?

3695
02:50:13,880 --> 02:50:16,680
Are free to play MMOs really a good thing?

3696
02:50:16,680 --> 02:50:17,580
Hell yes.

3697
02:50:18,760 --> 02:50:20,080
Depends who it's good for.

3698
02:50:20,080 --> 02:50:22,880
As far as being good to get people to try your game,

3699
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:24,320
yes.

3700
02:50:24,320 --> 02:50:26,640
Whether people try your game

3701
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:29,160
and then decide to pay for stuff, maybe not.

3702
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:33,960
I see no problem because I mean,

3703
02:50:33,960 --> 02:50:35,600
I was paying for Star Trek Online

3704
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:38,000
and then had cryptic points.

3705
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,980
So no big there.

3706
02:50:40,980 --> 02:50:42,800
I've heard of where free to play

3707
02:50:42,800 --> 02:50:45,640
has kind of driven games downhill though,

3708
02:50:45,640 --> 02:50:47,480
or at least according to some of the loyal people

3709
02:50:47,480 --> 02:50:48,600
who play the game.

3710
02:50:48,600 --> 02:50:52,020
And like one example I could think of for that

3711
02:50:52,020 --> 02:50:53,320
is Team Fortress 2.

3712
02:50:53,320 --> 02:50:55,820
Now note, I'm not saying Team Fortress 2 is a bad game.

3713
02:50:55,820 --> 02:50:57,320
It's not, it's a good game.

3714
02:50:57,320 --> 02:51:00,080
But some people, you might remember we reported on this,

3715
02:51:00,080 --> 02:51:02,480
when Team Fortress 2 first went free to play,

3716
02:51:02,480 --> 02:51:04,960
the community was very against that.

3717
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:07,600
Well, some of the community was very against that.

3718
02:51:07,600 --> 02:51:08,540
In fact, they went so far,

3719
02:51:08,540 --> 02:51:11,040
remember there were some servers that would ban you

3720
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:13,480
if it caught that you were using the free to play version,

3721
02:51:13,480 --> 02:51:15,120
like somehow they could tell the difference.

3722
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:17,400
And it was like, we don't want these people here.

3723
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:18,860
And sometimes an MMO is like,

3724
02:51:18,860 --> 02:51:21,340
I can imagine a game like DC Universe.

3725
02:51:21,340 --> 02:51:23,920
Like one day you're paying for DC Universe, right?

3726
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:25,520
You're paying your $15 a month.

3727
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:27,800
Suddenly the game goes free to play.

3728
02:51:27,800 --> 02:51:30,840
Now your servers are drowning under all the people

3729
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:32,400
that are trying to get on the server.

3730
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:34,400
And it's like, where it might be a good thing

3731
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:36,300
that more people are playing your game.

3732
02:51:36,300 --> 02:51:38,580
Now it's all these people who didn't pay anything to get in.

3733
02:51:38,580 --> 02:51:41,080
So it's kind of like they might be ruining the party

3734
02:51:41,080 --> 02:51:41,920
a little bit.

3735
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:42,740
Does that make sense?

3736
02:51:44,360 --> 02:51:46,000
What if they, what if these companies

3737
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,600
actually did have a pay only server?

3738
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:50,800
Or you know, like an old school server

3739
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:53,120
or like new servers just for new people or something.

3740
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:54,560
That could be a way to get around it.

3741
02:51:54,560 --> 02:51:55,720
We'll come back to this topic in a minute,

3742
02:51:55,720 --> 02:51:56,720
but first we have another call.

3743
02:51:56,720 --> 02:51:57,760
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3744
02:51:57,760 --> 02:51:58,600
Who's this?

3745
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,480
Hey, this is Cloud of Cleveland.

3746
02:52:02,480 --> 02:52:03,320
Cloud Cleveland?

3747
02:52:03,320 --> 02:52:04,680
I haven't been in a chat for a long time.

3748
02:52:04,680 --> 02:52:06,080
Hey, well, what's up buddy?

3749
02:52:07,360 --> 02:52:08,200
Yo, bro.

3750
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:10,840
Hey, Rob, you are a Rez fan, right?

3751
02:52:10,840 --> 02:52:11,760
For the old Dreamcast?

3752
02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:13,020
Frickin' love Rez.

3753
02:52:13,020 --> 02:52:14,720
Happy 10 year anniversary.

3754
02:52:14,720 --> 02:52:16,280
Hell yeah.

3755
02:52:16,280 --> 02:52:17,120
I know, right?

3756
02:52:17,120 --> 02:52:18,840
Have you gotten to play Child of Eden yet?

3757
02:52:18,840 --> 02:52:19,680
I do.

3758
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:20,840
I have played Child of Eden.

3759
02:52:20,840 --> 02:52:22,200
Child of Eden, I want to play it

3760
02:52:22,200 --> 02:52:25,060
on the PlayStation 3 for real.

3761
02:52:25,060 --> 02:52:27,980
I liked it, but I thought the Kinect control

3762
02:52:27,980 --> 02:52:28,820
was a little weird.

3763
02:52:28,820 --> 02:52:30,400
It was like cool to play once,

3764
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:32,900
but I prefer just playing it with a controller.

3765
02:52:32,900 --> 02:52:35,480
And I didn't like the music as much as I liked Rez.

3766
02:52:35,480 --> 02:52:37,680
I really didn't, but it was still a good game.

3767
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:40,240
I couldn't let people say that actually about the music.

3768
02:52:40,240 --> 02:52:42,160
It just, you know, I mean, it's not that it was bad.

3769
02:52:42,160 --> 02:52:43,200
It wasn't bad by anything means.

3770
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:44,560
And I'm always going to love anything

3771
02:52:44,560 --> 02:52:49,920
Tetsuya Mizuguchi puts out, but it wasn't Rez.

3772
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:53,560
And the price was tough to swallow,

3773
02:52:53,560 --> 02:52:57,280
but you know, there's a lot of weird stuff

3774
02:52:57,280 --> 02:52:58,400
that comes out for a high price.

3775
02:52:58,400 --> 02:53:01,400
Like, at least it was better than five cars

3776
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:02,920
and three tracks.

3777
02:53:02,920 --> 02:53:05,320
It was a better game than that, that's for sure.

3778
02:53:06,820 --> 02:53:08,700
Okay, maybe I'll wait for it to go budget title

3779
02:53:08,700 --> 02:53:10,200
before I actually pick it up myself.

3780
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:11,520
Well, there's a lot of Black Friday videos.

3781
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:12,640
My gosh, dude.

3782
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:17,640
I would say, my God, Mario 3D Land.

3783
02:53:19,260 --> 02:53:22,740
You know, between that and Kirby Return to Dream Land,

3784
02:53:22,740 --> 02:53:24,940
those two games have really put a lot of faith

3785
02:53:24,940 --> 02:53:26,620
into Nintendo for me.

3786
02:53:26,620 --> 02:53:28,960
Isn't it funny how the entire internet,

3787
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:31,260
and this show included, or at least myself,

3788
02:53:31,260 --> 02:53:33,500
I can't speak for the other two,

3789
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:37,080
but it's so interesting the love-hate relationship

3790
02:53:37,080 --> 02:53:37,920
we have with Nintendo,

3791
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:39,520
is that sometimes we look at the decisions they make

3792
02:53:39,520 --> 02:53:41,260
and we go, you guys are idiots.

3793
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:42,840
Like, why are you doing this?

3794
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:45,100
Why don't you understand online?

3795
02:53:45,100 --> 02:53:46,580
You know, how many years has it been?

3796
02:53:46,580 --> 02:53:48,300
God damn, friend codes?

3797
02:53:48,300 --> 02:53:50,500
Why do we always hurt the ones we love?

3798
02:53:50,500 --> 02:53:53,460
Right, but then they go and they put out

3799
02:53:53,460 --> 02:53:57,040
fucking Mario 3D Land, this Kirby game,

3800
02:53:57,040 --> 02:53:59,480
which I hear is really good, Zelda,

3801
02:53:59,480 --> 02:54:04,280
and supposedly, assuming Mario Kart 7 is just as good,

3802
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:07,740
it's like, damn, we got a lot of good games all at once,

3803
02:54:07,740 --> 02:54:11,220
and oh shit, the golden rule of gaming really is

3804
02:54:11,220 --> 02:54:13,720
a system is only as good as the games that are on it,

3805
02:54:13,720 --> 02:54:15,860
and you have to take a step back and say,

3806
02:54:15,860 --> 02:54:18,040
well shit, these are some really good games,

3807
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:21,460
so despite all the bonehead moves Nintendo makes sometimes,

3808
02:54:21,460 --> 02:54:24,280
sometimes when it's right, it's really right.

3809
02:54:25,860 --> 02:54:28,360
Oh no, I mean, now it's completely worth having to weave

3810
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:30,560
for me, I've actually pulled it out of my closet

3811
02:54:30,560 --> 02:54:32,460
just to be able to play these games,

3812
02:54:32,460 --> 02:54:36,000
and thankfully, the 3DS didn't have to wait as long

3813
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,300
for some decent games,

3814
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:39,720
and hopefully this won't be the end of it.

3815
02:54:39,720 --> 02:54:41,860
Yeah, it's interesting, there's been other stories

3816
02:54:41,860 --> 02:54:44,280
this week that Reggie is saying that just because

3817
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:45,820
the Wii U is coming out does not mean

3818
02:54:45,820 --> 02:54:47,580
the Wii's life cycle is done,

3819
02:54:47,580 --> 02:54:49,420
and I think a lot of us are looking at that

3820
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:50,700
with kind of one eyebrow raised,

3821
02:54:50,700 --> 02:54:53,020
like, how are the systems going to coexist?

3822
02:54:53,020 --> 02:54:55,520
And I think you kind of have to say that to some extent,

3823
02:54:55,520 --> 02:54:57,540
because you don't want the Wiis to stop selling

3824
02:54:57,540 --> 02:55:01,140
this holiday season, I still think Xenoblade's

3825
02:55:01,140 --> 02:55:04,540
gonna come out, I think that, hmm,

3826
02:55:04,540 --> 02:55:05,700
I always go back and forth with this,

3827
02:55:05,700 --> 02:55:08,020
I swore up and down that if they didn't announce

3828
02:55:08,020 --> 02:55:10,000
it at Penny Arcade, it wasn't fucking happening,

3829
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:11,380
but I'm kind of like, you know,

3830
02:55:11,380 --> 02:55:13,840
what else do they fucking have next year?

3831
02:55:13,840 --> 02:55:16,160
They've gotta have almost all of their people

3832
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:19,440
working on making the Wii U better,

3833
02:55:19,440 --> 02:55:21,480
because it's gotta be better at next year's E3,

3834
02:55:21,480 --> 02:55:23,500
I think you're gonna see a much different system

3835
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:26,680
next year's E3, and I don't mean like,

3836
02:55:26,680 --> 02:55:28,600
suddenly it's not gonna have a touchscreen anymore,

3837
02:55:28,600 --> 02:55:30,020
any of that stuff, I just mean,

3838
02:55:30,020 --> 02:55:31,520
you're gonna definitely see the games,

3839
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:33,160
you're gonna see the reason why Nintendo

3840
02:55:33,160 --> 02:55:35,000
really believes in this, you're gonna see this E3,

3841
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:38,440
is that they can't prove that, that system is fucked.

3842
02:55:38,440 --> 02:55:43,440
But I think because they've got all their people

3843
02:55:43,800 --> 02:55:46,540
working to make the Wii U great,

3844
02:55:46,540 --> 02:55:49,860
they're kinda keeping this backlog of Wii things

3845
02:55:49,860 --> 02:55:51,920
that they can release through 2012,

3846
02:55:51,920 --> 02:55:54,600
and that's what I think has happened to the last story

3847
02:55:54,600 --> 02:55:56,840
and Xenoblade and all these rainfall games,

3848
02:55:56,840 --> 02:55:59,280
is that I think you're gonna slowly see them

3849
02:55:59,280 --> 02:56:01,960
trickle out through 2012, because Nintendo

3850
02:56:01,960 --> 02:56:04,560
can't afford to work on anything for the Wii right now,

3851
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:06,280
yet at the same time, they can't afford

3852
02:56:06,280 --> 02:56:07,720
to just let the Wii die.

3853
02:56:07,720 --> 02:56:10,520
So they don't wanna blow their load this holiday season.

3854
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:13,920
They've gotta let it kinda trickle out through 2012.

3855
02:56:13,920 --> 02:56:17,340
So I think you still will see those games come out.

3856
02:56:17,340 --> 02:56:19,060
Will the people that are so diehard

3857
02:56:19,060 --> 02:56:21,160
on Operation Rainfall still give a damn?

3858
02:56:21,160 --> 02:56:23,560
Because I'll tell you from first-hand experience,

3859
02:56:23,560 --> 02:56:26,520
it's really easy to download Xenoblade from the internet

3860
02:56:26,520 --> 02:56:28,280
and play it on your Wii right now.

3861
02:56:28,280 --> 02:56:30,960
Like, you don't have to do a hardware modification to it.

3862
02:56:30,960 --> 02:56:33,920
So will the internet collectively still care

3863
02:56:33,920 --> 02:56:35,200
this time next year?

3864
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:38,200
That's, because especially a game like Xenoblade

3865
02:56:38,200 --> 02:56:39,500
is really for the core gamer.

3866
02:56:39,500 --> 02:56:41,340
You can't sell Xenoblade to a soccer mom

3867
02:56:41,340 --> 02:56:42,920
with her seven-year-olds.

3868
02:56:42,920 --> 02:56:44,500
But Xenoblade is a really good game

3869
02:56:44,500 --> 02:56:46,700
that if you do own a Wii, you should check out.

3870
02:56:47,980 --> 02:56:48,820
So.

3871
02:56:48,820 --> 02:56:49,720
All right, I won't actually look into that one.

3872
02:56:49,720 --> 02:56:50,640
Thanks for the suggestion.

3873
02:56:50,640 --> 02:56:52,880
No problem, except for you,

3874
02:56:52,880 --> 02:56:54,440
unless you happen to be in Europe,

3875
02:56:54,440 --> 02:56:56,880
you won't find it here, or you're gonna have to turn

3876
02:56:56,880 --> 02:56:59,360
to the dark side of the internet,

3877
02:56:59,360 --> 02:57:00,840
which SOPA may eliminate.

3878
02:57:00,840 --> 02:57:04,160
So get it now while you still can.

3879
02:57:04,160 --> 02:57:05,720
Yeah, I hope not.

3880
02:57:05,720 --> 02:57:07,960
I don't usually advocate piracy,

3881
02:57:07,960 --> 02:57:10,040
but when the company leaves you no other choice

3882
02:57:10,040 --> 02:57:12,520
to play the game, I don't know what else to tell people.

3883
02:57:12,520 --> 02:57:13,760
Xenoblade's a great game.

3884
02:57:15,800 --> 02:57:18,200
Yeah, you know, if you can't get the licensing

3885
02:57:18,200 --> 02:57:22,080
in your country or whatever, you know, other options, man.

3886
02:57:22,080 --> 02:57:23,440
Yep, so.

3887
02:57:23,440 --> 02:57:25,280
All right, well, anything else you want to ask

3888
02:57:25,280 --> 02:57:27,500
or get out with the show tonight?

3889
02:57:28,900 --> 02:57:30,140
No, that's about it, bro.

3890
02:57:30,140 --> 02:57:31,520
All right, well, thanks so much for your call,

3891
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:33,480
and have fun with Child of Eden.

3892
02:57:33,480 --> 02:57:34,760
You should get it when it,

3893
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:36,440
you're gonna see a lot of good sales through the holidays.

3894
02:57:36,440 --> 02:57:37,800
So definitely check it out.

3895
02:57:39,120 --> 02:57:39,960
Right.

3896
02:57:39,960 --> 02:57:40,780
All right, take care, buddy.

3897
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:45,040
1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype

3898
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:47,640
is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

3899
02:57:48,880 --> 02:57:50,080
Love to hear from you.

3900
02:57:50,080 --> 02:57:51,480
Did I finish all the tweets or was there one of them?

3901
02:57:51,480 --> 02:57:53,680
Oh, we were still on the free-to-play thing.

3902
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:54,740
We were talking about that.

3903
02:57:54,740 --> 02:57:56,480
And Dark Soccer, you were talking about

3904
02:57:56,480 --> 02:57:58,380
that you kind of, even your experiences,

3905
02:57:58,380 --> 02:58:02,240
you know, the Star Wars, or Star Trek, thank you.

3906
02:58:02,240 --> 02:58:03,080
I really should know better.

3907
02:58:03,080 --> 02:58:04,920
But it would just be certain things that I would want,

3908
02:58:04,920 --> 02:58:06,760
and they would be very reasonable.

3909
02:58:06,760 --> 02:58:10,600
Like, I could get a thing of the lowest end

3910
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:12,240
of Cryptic Point or something,

3911
02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:15,820
and it would last me through, like, months of releases.

3912
02:58:15,820 --> 02:58:16,660
Yeah.

3913
02:58:16,660 --> 02:58:17,840
So.

3914
02:58:17,840 --> 02:58:19,200
All right.

3915
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:20,480
Since the phone's not ringing again,

3916
02:58:20,480 --> 02:58:21,660
I think we're actually gonna shut it down,

3917
02:58:21,660 --> 02:58:22,500
because believe it or not,

3918
02:58:22,500 --> 02:58:23,960
this has been a long show tonight,

3919
02:58:23,960 --> 02:58:25,640
especially considering our website is down

3920
02:58:25,640 --> 02:58:27,600
and we weren't able to do a proper show roll.

3921
02:58:27,600 --> 02:58:29,160
We did a good job filling time.

3922
02:58:29,160 --> 02:58:30,700
So we gotta wrap up.

3923
02:58:30,700 --> 02:58:32,760
That was it for the tweets, too.

3924
02:58:32,760 --> 02:58:35,400
And we gotta get everybody's final thoughts

3925
02:58:35,400 --> 02:58:36,260
before we wrap up.

3926
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:38,480
I think we already did last-minute stories.

3927
02:58:38,480 --> 02:58:42,560
So let's get everybody's last-minute thoughts.

3928
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:45,680
My final thought tonight is I'm excited to go home

3929
02:58:45,680 --> 02:58:47,800
and eat, yay, food, I love food.

3930
02:58:47,800 --> 02:58:49,040
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3931
02:58:49,040 --> 02:58:52,600
Making good headway on Call of Duty formatting.

3932
02:58:52,600 --> 02:58:53,920
And last but not least, Dark Soccer,

3933
02:58:53,920 --> 02:58:54,760
your final thought tonight?

3934
02:58:54,760 --> 02:58:56,760
My night is far from over.

3935
02:58:56,760 --> 02:58:58,000
Woo-hoo!

3936
02:58:58,000 --> 02:58:58,820
All right.

3937
02:58:58,820 --> 02:59:00,600
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show

3938
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:01,880
and tuning into Orange Laundry Radio.

3939
02:59:01,880 --> 02:59:03,160
We really appreciate your support.

3940
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:06,560
Hey, especially when poopy things happen to us,

3941
02:59:06,560 --> 02:59:09,400
like, you know, our internet goes out

3942
02:59:09,400 --> 02:59:11,440
so we can't do a show one week randomly,

3943
02:59:11,440 --> 02:59:14,640
or, you know, our website suddenly goes down.

3944
02:59:14,640 --> 02:59:16,880
We really appreciate that you guys stand by with us.

3945
02:59:16,880 --> 02:59:18,080
Even though I know the podcasties

3946
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:18,920
will be a little bit behind,

3947
02:59:18,920 --> 02:59:21,640
we still had a very full chat room tonight,

3948
02:59:21,640 --> 02:59:24,000
and I really appreciate that, all things considered.

3949
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:25,080
Considering we don't have a website

3950
02:59:25,080 --> 02:59:26,640
where you can go to chat.orangelaundryradio.com

3951
02:59:26,640 --> 02:59:27,480
or any of that.

3952
02:59:27,480 --> 02:59:29,560
So, really appreciate you guys.

3953
02:59:29,560 --> 02:59:30,840
If you like what you heard,

3954
02:59:30,840 --> 02:59:32,280
we're not begging for your money.

3955
02:59:32,280 --> 02:59:35,320
All we ask, tell people about the show, word of mouth.

3956
02:59:36,440 --> 02:59:38,640
Help spread the word about the show.

3957
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:41,120
Tell a person who may not have heard of it about the show,

3958
02:59:41,120 --> 02:59:42,760
and help the O.L. Army grow.

3959
02:59:42,760 --> 02:59:47,360
And we can spread the word, the term of Xbox lube,

3960
02:59:47,360 --> 02:59:49,880
throughout the universe.

3961
02:59:49,880 --> 02:59:52,320
That's gonna do it for another week of Orange Laundry Radio.

3962
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:54,440
We'll be back next week, hopefully with a website

3963
02:59:54,440 --> 02:59:55,880
and everything to do it all over again

3964
02:59:55,880 --> 02:59:57,360
with next week in gaming news.

3965
02:59:57,360 --> 03:00:01,000
And I'm sure even more games to be played this week,

3966
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,040
including, it sounds like Mario Kart 7,

3967
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:07,240
but in a couple, by this time next week, right?

3968
03:00:07,240 --> 03:00:09,400
The fourth, oh my God.

3969
03:00:09,400 --> 03:00:11,840
So much more coming, so we'll be back next week.

3970
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:14,320
Until then, have a great week.

3971
03:00:14,320 --> 03:00:16,680
And don't be a dick to each other online.

3972
03:00:16,680 --> 03:00:19,920
