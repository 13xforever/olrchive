All Games Radio is now broadcasting live from Sacramento, California.
Up next, Orange Lounge Radio.
The following program is intended for mature audiences.
Orange Lounge Radio.
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loki.
Okay.
Tonight, November 27th, 2011, a special connect for Windows is detailed, one group of people want Skyrim to be banned, and is Sony planning an answer to Smash Bros. ?
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live at All Games Radio where we do tape live every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
www.allgames.com if you want to tune in to listen.
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
I'm almost full.
Yeah?
I made lamb leg with parsnips in the slow cooker.
And then I took the broth, so it's got all that good meat fat in it.
Food, food, food, food, food, food.
And cooked quinoa in it, so now my quinoa's creamy.
Now, I notice in your other hand, you have an old friend of the show who's been gone for like several years.
He ran away to die.
Makes his triumphant return to the show tonight.
Are you going to say hello?
Hello?
Yeah, but this is going to break your heart, or my heart anyway.
All right, here we go.
Oh, he's working now.
He was going... Oh, and I pressed it earlier.
It's the OLR ferret, the official orange laundry... Oh, God.
He's not doing healthy after all these years.
He might need to have an operation.
You might have to open up his butt and replace the battery.
Well... Oh, but look at that face.
The Orange Lounge Radio ferret is slowly dying, ladies and gentlemen.
Just like the quality of this program.
Say hello as well.
He's gonna model my quinoa.
I don't know why you're bothering to take a picture of it because we have no website right now, but hey.
The flicker still works.
That's true.
The flicker still works.
Get it up there for when it comes back.
Joining us as well, hopefully not about to soon die.
He'll be with us for a long, long time.
Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
Yeah, you can replace the batteries in those by cutting the stomach open.
I did that one time.
Remember we had like four ferrets at one time.
I do.
I don't know where they went.
You came into the show one time and you were like, hey, Jamie, here.
And you threw like five ferrets at her.
And I held them all the entire episode because they were my babies.
We mailed one to one of our friends in Colorado, Rai Chan.
I don't know if she still listens, but she's out there.
And I think we gave another one to a longtime OLR listener.
Didn't one of them get stuck to a Katamari?
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura.com
but thankfully so around 4 o'clock that day we just had to make a decision like okay well we can't even really tape a show without internet because we use internet to get our stories and to do some of the other incidental background music and stuff so we couldn't do a show period so we said eh we'll just take the week off anyway it's right before Thanksgiving so whatever a lot of shows are going to be off
We're back here tonight to news that we don't have a website right now.
I know when you go to orange.com, it says something about an account billing issue.
That's actually not the issue.
It's not something as obvious as Rob didn't pay the bill.
It's the man bringing us down.
It is.
It's SOPA.
It went into effect, everybody.
And unfortunately, because we play music during the show.
No, it's not.
It's the 1%.
It's the man.
No, here's the thing.
Our website space has been graciously donated for the past... When did we move off of my personal domain?
It was about seven years ago.
So, I mean, it was a long, long time ago.
We were on live 365.
Let me put it that way.
So it was a long time ago.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and unfortunately when things break because we don't pay for it that doesn't mean things get fixed right away so we have to understand that you know beggars can't be choosers so he is aware he's working on it don't pester him about it he knows and I know he's working really hard to try and fix it one way or another even if that ends up meaning we have to kind of get web space somewhere else so keep an eye on our Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR or our Facebook and we'll let you know what's going on with the website as we know
Unfortunately, this does mean that it affects the podcast folks because without a website, we can't deliver the podcast.
So the only people here in this show right now are our live listeners.
And it probably won't make the feed tonight, which is unfortunate because we've been on a really good track record of getting the show up for the Monday morning crowd.
And sadly, it won't be there for them tonight.
But we'll get it up as soon as we possibly can.
So hopefully you podcastees will be listening to this before too long.
So...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Honestly, if that's too difficult, just go to chat.allgames.com and they'll point you in the right direction.
And my apologies to the fine folks at All Games Chat, but they'll understand, I hope.
So anyhow, before we get into our gaming weeks and all that, I thought we could talk a little bit about this.
It's something I kind of wanted to talk about last week.
We didn't end up having a show.
Sorry.
It's not your fault.
Just things happen.
We'll talk a little bit about charity.
Waffle Irons
Waffle irons for $2?
Waffle irons for $2 you say?
Yes, just try not to get clobbered with one.
You see the YouTube of all them people fighting over $2 waffle irons?
It's quite a sight to behold.
That's stupid.
You want to hear something else that's stupid?
We got back after having Thanksgiving dinner with our family and we came home and we're like, crap, there's like nothing to do.
Let's watch TV.
Hey look, Lady Gaga's having a Thanksgiving...
Special.
I didn't see it, believe it or not.
She made waffles with salami.
I wouldn't say she made waffles.
A chef that makes food for her was making waffles with salami in them.
That's weird, but I'd try it.
Were you tempted by Gaga's delicious waffles?
I think you were.
Waffles are good, but it was weird.
Waffle Gaga.
Lady Woff Woff.
That sounds kind of dirty.
It does a little bit.
All right.
So anyhow, charity.
Hello.
Going back to charity.
I know Child's Play is obviously one of the biggest gamer charities, and they've kicked off their official donation season during the holidays.
There's been a lot of stuff going on, like Desert Bus.
Gosh, this has been, what, the fifth year I think that's been going on?
If you don't know what Desert Bus is, I don't think you've been following a lot of the gaming internet stuff, but we'll explain it anyway.
There's this game that came out on... God, what system was Desert Bus on?
Was that a 3DO game?
It was on some obscure-ish system, wasn't it?
That was on the Sega CD.
That was part of the Penn & Teller game.
That was on the Sega CD.
Was it Sega CD?
It was Penn & Teller's Smoke & Mirrors.
I knew it was one of those CD systems I didn't have.
And you drive a bus for like...
The whole thing.
And the deal is, you drive a bus from LA to Vegas, but don't expect the graphics to look like, you know, Burnout or something.
Wasn't the whole thing is that they hate video games or something, so they made a video game?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So...
Something about the realism or something.
Yeah, and you really drive the actual distance.
It's not abbreviated.
And you're not allowed to drive above a certain mileage because you're driving a bus.
So to drive from one to the other takes like four hours.
And you can't just rubber band the button down or anything because every so often you have to slightly adjust your steering or the bus will go off track.
Yeah, because the alignment's not correct.
Exactly.
So when you make it all the way, you score one point.
It Takes Like 4 Hours to Do So
DarkSakura.com
DesertBus.com
Which is nice because they actually donate all the proceeds for the iOS 1 to the Child's Play charity And I want to say, wasn't that the one where Penn Jillette actually ended up donating money?
I don't think it was this year, I think it was last year or something He donated quite a bit of money, like he actually knew about it So, it's kind of neat
So anyhow, lots of charity stuff going on.
So, you know, think about some of that money you saved on all those, you know, Black Friday sales or Steam sales or so forth.
Think about giving it to a good cause.
And even if that cause is not child's play for you, maybe it's, I don't know, St.
Jude's Hospital, March for Babies, American Red Cross, whatever the charity is.
Although about the American Red Cross, though, keep your money out of, you know, those guys...
ringing the bells in front of retail stores.
The Salvation Army?
Yeah.
Not a fan?
I thought that was Red Cross, but Salvation Army.
Yeah, don't give them any money because, especially now, I guess they're taking credit cards as well.
I mean, do I really want to slide a credit card through a skimmer that they may have so that I can hopefully get the money going to them and not some crook?
Just do it through online if you're going to do that.
The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio, not necessarily.
All right, anyway.
Well, actually, they have caught a number of scammers.
Just be careful.
Always be careful.
Get a receipt.
Do it through the websites.
Or just do Desert Bus or Umlaut, because those are two ones we know, or Child's Play themselves, and those are several different ones we know are reputable and all that.
Alright, anyhow Let's move on, let's talk about video games And how was your gaming week The video games you've been playing this week I don't know about you guys, but I've played a ton So let's go around the table, start with DarkSakura Ladies first
Well, I actually played some stuff while my internet was sort of working.
I actually played a lot of droplets, Rob.
That's that random-ass puzzle game that's on Steam, huh?
Yeah, it's actually pretty funny.
Funny.
Fun, I should say.
I don't want to say it's like Pipe Dream, but it does involve pipes and water going through, but it's all like they're falling.
But you've run out of drops.
Yeah.
and you have to collect them in your reservoir and get more and you can actually get little pockets that will open up that you can get more drops and so you get a score as long as you have drops to play with actually I have to look at my Steam list because I have to look at what I was like I actually played a bunch of Portal 2 as well just you know again while my internet was not working
Do the Humble Indie Bundle
I don't think they have a bundle going on right now there's a different type of bundle we're going to talk about a little later in the show but as far as the gaming bundle there's nothing right now but there probably will be one soon enough those have been doing very well so we'll see
I was also playing some Doom 2 and playing Peggle Extreme.
I tried to play Magicka, but while my internet was down, it was like, no, you can't play this game.
And then a few people actually all gave me the same game.
They gave me Fallout New Vegas.
Gee, tough problem.
Wait, wait, several people bought you Fallout New Vegas?
I know it was on sale earlier this week.
I guess so.
Was it on your wish list or something?
I think it might have been.
Ah, there you go.
I mean, I can look, but yeah, Fallout New Vegas is actually really sweet.
I put up a couple of screenies from... I can pull up my Steam account and show people a few screenies, but I mean...
I had never really had much of an interest in playing it, but when I started playing it, it really... I had friends that played the RPG and kind of seeing their books and seeing how the game set up, it actually kind of seemed like the same, you know, had the same feel, except then you're, you know, first person.
Or you can play third person.
You can play behind the shoulder.
So I didn't actually get as bad motion sick as I might have.
RedHair
DarkSakura.com
And if you don't know what game they did, they're the folks behind Darwinia.
So Darwinia is in this bundle, as well as Uplink, Defcon, Multiwinia is all in this.
And if you pay more than the average, which right now is $3.75, gosh, that's so low.
I would hope you'd pay at least like $10 or $20 for this.
Aquaria and Crayon Physics Deluxe get thrown in as well.
So there is a bundle going on right now.
My apologies.
I don't know.
How much longer is that going for?
Is that like just tonight or is that going into next week?
Let's see.
Eight days left.
Oh, shit.
So you've got some time there.
You got at least another week.
Usually if you wait to the end, there's more stuff tacked on.
Looks like they've already done it.
All right.
And even if you buy early, you still get the extra stuff that they end up adding.
And what I really like about the way Humble Bundle does it is that you get steam codes for everything.
so like I bought it and then I just loaded it all into Steam the last time I bought one which was the bundle that had VVVV in it so yeah pretty cool oh yeah I've actually played more than oh yeah I did play WoW for the record I'm working on my rep with the Shatari Skyguard good times so I can fly around on a fat short manta ray there's a birthday party going on in WoW right now
Oh yeah, that thing.
It messes up my look, Rob.
And just a little quick side note.
What?
Whoever that freaking Tarin was that was killing all my birds, DIAF.
The end.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
And this is going to be continuing on because we're not playing Grand Theft Auto anymore.
We're playing Call of Duty now.
This is weird to me.
Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
I'm still kicking ass, though.
And you know what?
You've turned into a bro.
No, no.
It's been, what, like less than a week and I'm already trying to mod the game.
So I'm working on a mod for Call of Duty.
Dan's yelling from the other room, make it not suck.
I have a tangent about bros I want to talk about in a minute.
It's been pretty fun.
We're playing hardcore mode because they don't like the fact that I can kill faster if I have a map and I can see where people are firing from.
I'm still killing pretty fast anyways.
We're just
Thank you for watching!
But yeah, I am working on something actually kind of unique for it.
Just like some special balance mod thing where each class would have different weapons and a special ability kind of like a button or something that you would have a one minute ability that would be like god mode or invisibility or something like that.
And then with a five minute cooldown for each thing.
So it's really intricate, but you can actually program quite a bit and call it to you, which is kind of cool.
So I'm going to mess around with that.
Actually, hopefully I'm going to mess around with Grand Theft Auto mods at some point.
Because I've just been really distracted by everything.
I've played Saints Row.
I've pretty much beat Saints Row.
Actually, I have beat Saints Row almost 100%.
All the side missions and stuff were done except for the car thefts.
And those are really annoying because it's really glitched.
The one I was on now, apparently every time you go into the zone to steal the car...
Thanks for watching!
For the most part, I have everything done.
I just have to play through the game again to finish some missions in a different way, like Act 1, finish that in a different way, and then also the third act I have to finish, or Murder Brawl, I have to do that a different way.
Did the Tron parody stuff in Saints Row end up being good, or was it just kind of... Yeah, that's pretty much what you saw in the video.
They had some interesting stuff.
There's even a little bit of Zork in there.
Awesome.
Do you get eaten by a Gru?
No, there's actually a text adventure part.
Awesome.
You have to do a little bit of stuff there.
But it's pretty awesome.
Do you end up in front of a house and there is a white mailbox here?
Something like that.
It's a parody of it, so you have to go kill a unicorn, is what it is.
Damn you, unicorns!
So there was something with that, but what's kind of cool, though, is the perks that you get from beating that portion of the game is you actually get one of the combat tanks, and you get to drive around the city and fire it, and it has all the sound effects from combat, which is great.
It's a big, blocky tank.
And then they also have...
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm afraid.
She'll be wearing all black and kill things with fire.
Okay.
I kill things with fire.
I approve of the killing with fire.
But yeah, because what's great about it is you can actually go into the... Well, you can go on the website.
She should have a giant menorah she whaps people with.
I would not do that to my menorah.
They don't have that.
What's kind of cool, though, is you can go on the website and...
Thanks for watching!
I've got so much I'm trying to play right now anyway.
I can use another one.
But you really should play Saints Row the Third.
I really do want to play Saints Row the Third, especially knowing that somebody else made my damn character.
It is awesome.
But it actually turned out really good.
It is.
I saw the pictures and I'm like, that's cute.
It's such a great game.
Seriously, I enjoyed every minute of it.
I did play it for over 30 hours because I got that achievement.
30 and 30.
3 and 30, I guess.
and play over 30 hours of the game.
So yeah, aside from that, I've been playing Skyrim, which is great.
I almost gave it up pretty quick because the first time I played the game, something glitched out and I went to the first town I'm supposed to go to and everyone started attacking me, trying to kill me.
I'm like...
Okay, what the fuck?
I can't do anything because you guys keep trying to attack me.
Except for the one character I was supposed to talk to.
He was fine, but everyone's trying to kill me.
I'm like, okay, I don't understand why you have to piss everybody off.
So I finally tried it again, and I'm really enjoying it because now it's actually working correctly.
You might have accidentally murdered somebody.
Maybe.
Maybe I hit somebody with a sword.
Maybe I decapitated somebody and forgot.
Oops.
Well, like I had something earlier that I ran into, like I decided to go exploring off and then I see this giant attacking these two people, so I'm going to go help them.
So I, you know, start shooting fire at the giant.
So people started coming and attacking me because I guess some of the splash damage started hitting them.
Like, you fucking idiots, you know, so what?
You got injured a little bit.
I killed the giant for you.
For such an enormously enormous game, like a game as vast as Skyrim, it does really have its derpy moments.
There's some real things in Skyrim that just don't make sense.
Like, it should be like, if you do a little bit of damage to somebody, they're like, hey, you know, don't do that, or something.
And then if you continually do that, then they should start attacking you, but not just like, oh, I accidentally dealt a little bit of damage to you, or like, oh, you ran in front of my arrow, or something like that, and unfortunately you got stuck with an arrow.
They should have a little bit of like, you know, kind of, hey, stop that, and then start attacking you if you keep attacking them.
I think that'd be a little bit better than, you know, oh, I accidentally hit you with a fireball because I was aiming at the troll that's right next to you or something like that.
Anyways, um... I like some of the lulzy stuff people have done with Skyrim Online, like the house full of cabbage.
Yeah.
I had to fight, once again, exploring because I'm trying to get enough money to buy these booths to allow me to pick up more things, which is ironic because I got the money, the amount of money that was in the game to do that, and all of a sudden I go back down to buy them, oh, and now they're more expensive.
I'm like, fuck you, I'm not buying those anymore.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
so I was like ah shit these things look magical that's not good so I killed them and then it was the Wisp mother that was there started shooting like some ice thing at me and so I decided to go try to kill her and that took about 15 to 20 minutes to actually take her down because I'm such a low level character yeah but they level with you so it would have taken 15-20 minutes anyway
Really?
You do get a little bit of edge because of the talents and so forth that you get, but unfortunately the enemies, it's not like a Final Fantasy where if you just grind, grind, grind, you'll be able to overpower everything.
It doesn't work like that.
But anyways, so yeah.
Honestly, in any Elder Scrolls game, you should just do the main story first, so that way you can just do it when it's easy and then go back and do open world lousy fun.
Maybe we should do that then.
That's the way to approach an Elder Scrolls game, I really think.
Um, so yeah, so I, it took me about 15 minutes, but it's funny because, you know, you were saying the house full of cabbages and stuff, and the game's not exactly realistic, like, at one point, because I had a bunch of stuff from crafting things, either, you know, making food or making, uh, you know, alchemy and stuff like that.
So I got to the point where I had exhausted my potions that I had with me, and I'm like, crap, I need more health.
So, like, I ate, like, 13 pounds of food at one point.
Like,
Level up.
Your skill in pooping has increased to 21.
It's just ridiculous.
It's like, okay, here's this two-pound cheese wheel.
This will give you two health.
I'm going to eat four of those.
I can imagine this guy, like, high minor rock just shoving his mouth full of, like, cabbage and carrots and, like,
you know raw rabbit and just all sorts of ridiculous stuff that you happen to be carrying with you and I also found another way it was kind of fun um I was really sad because remember how they had the thing where oh you can steal from people by putting pots over people's heads I thought there was only a pc until I figured out you have to hold a and then you can move shit around and I was like oh thank god it doesn't work though I haven't gotten it to work at all
Maybe there's a trick to it.
I've never tried it.
Which is too bad.
But it allowed me to, you know, because one of the things I kind of do is I pick up everything that, you know, is not attached, which is great because, like, you do, like, missions for people and stuff and all of a sudden they become, you know, friendly with you and they'll just let you take everything.
Like, I did a mission for the guy at the trading post or whatever and after that, it's like everything in the house allowed me to take it almost except for, like, expensive armor and stuff.
Guys, you know in our chatroom at chat.understandsradio.com disagrees with me on what I'm saying about the level scaling.
Saying the enemies don't really level with you anymore in Skyrim, Rob.
They changed it due to people not liking it in Oblivion.
It's more like Fallout now.
Really?
I could have sworn somebody was telling me that they were playing the game twice and saw the difference.
But maybe it's not as much of a weight as it was before.
Who knows?
I like being able to overpower everything, personally.
I hope that's true.
I haven't played enough Skyrim.
I really haven't because I've been distracted by so many other games.
I probably will not give Skyrim proper attention until Christmas time.
Skyrim's hilarious because at one point I was like, oh, hey, wait a second.
I can swim in the river.
I'm diving underwater and I'm catching salmon for no apparent reason other than I can.
That's the whole thing about Skyrim.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
I can.
Or Skyrim with the physics.
Hey, you can go along this mountain trail or you can just walk straight up the mountain.
Just hit jump a lot and you'll eventually climb the mountain.
That's what I do.
But yeah, I found out that if you're carrying too much, obviously it slows you down.
So what you can do is you can grab one more object by holding A, and it'll just hover out in front of you, and then you just run back to town.
You know, of course, if you get to any doorway, you'll pick it up, take it in your inventory, walk through the door, drop it, and pick it up again using the hold A thing, and just keep on running.
It was great.
I was able to take one... I brought you a pen!
I was able to take one more battle axe.
How stupid must that look?
Bobby has joined chat to try and clarify.
Our good friend Bobby Blackwolf who tapes before us live at All Games Radio.
Try and clarify.
Bring a little clarity to the rim of Sky.
Sky says, here's how it works.
Or Blackwolf says, Sky, here's how it works.
When you first enter a dungeon area, it generates the enemies to your level.
If you leave that dungeon, go level up and go back in, they will be the same level they used to be.
So you can overpower them, but not on the first entry.
Now that makes a lot of sense.
Here's what you need to do.
You need to find all the dungeons at level one.
Like I'm saying, go do the story mode right away.
I'm going to, but I get distracted so much.
I know.
I hear you.
Seriously, I have taken everything in that town, the first town, the Riverwood, whatever, and I've taken everything that has not been bolted down.
It's great.
There's so many glitches in the game.
Did you fill a house with cabbage?
I don't have a house to fill with cabbage yet, but I have a lot of cabbage.
Well, damn it, now you have a mission.
And I've eaten a lot of cabbage too, so that's not good.
Anything else about your gaming week?
We could talk about Skyrim all night.
Seriously.
Like, for example, one of the tricks you can level up any skill by those people that will actually tell you, like the first town you go to, there's an elf there that will help you improve your archery.
Well, if you invite him into, you can invite him to, you know,
Join you and he'll come and help you.
So you go and you pay for that and then you go, I need to trade with you and you take your money back and then you pay him again and take your money back.
In fact, the other thing is you can take his house key for no apparent reason or just take all of his inventory and then you go to his house and steal everything.
And then go to the middle of the forest and say, okay, wait here.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thank you for watching!
How about bitch?
Yeah, she's a really tough bitch.
And then on top of that, you kill her and she doesn't really die.
She just comes back to life again and starts fucking trying to kill you again.
She might be integral to the story or something.
You probably can't kill people that keep you from completing the actual story.
I don't care.
I know.
I know you don't care.
Just finish the story then go do whatever you want.
Whatever you want.
Burn a whole village down for all I care.
Then wait for the DLC.
Alright.
Anything else for your gaming week?
A little bit of Zuma.
That's it.
Let me move on.
I got some games I want to talk about.
I've played a lot.
I can only talk about some of the games I've played this week because I've played a lot in the past couple weeks since we last had a show.
So let me start with the one I've probably played the least of, which is Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
I bought this more for Alan because he wanted it.
And keep in mind, we didn't own Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
It's like we knew that they were going to release a new version just nine months later.
So we ordered that over Amazon.
They always do.
I know.
I know that for next time now.
So I'm going to be wary about buying Capcom games when they first come out.
I'm going to have to be convinced they're not going to release an Uber edition six months later.
So it's really my first taste of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at all.
The controls are weird because I guess they took more of a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom direction with them.
Not a fan.
Much easier if you've got the arcade controller.
Yeah, I could see that.
I could see that.
So I'm not a fan because I like my games like Street Fighter, but that's okay.
The art style is really good.
It's so fun to play on like an HDTV with awesome sound.
The graphics and everything look great.
Lots of great characters.
Some weird choices, especially on the Capcom side, but okay.
No, Rocket Raccoon.
No, I said on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.
That's Marvel.
Rocket Raccoon is Marvel.
I know.
I say weird choices on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.
Right, but that's a weird one.
Yeah, it is weird.
I hear you.
That's what I was saying.
I thought you liked Rocket Raccoon.
I do like Rocket Raccoon.
It's just sort of out of the blue.
Yeah, yeah.
So there are some weird choices in there.
But, you know, it can't all be, you know, totally mainstream.
That's kind of part of the fun of it.
So, yeah, I've just done some light skirmishes in that.
Very difficult game, too.
The difficulty's even on very easy.
It can be a pain in the ass.
Alan was screaming at the TV trying to beat Galactus, or at least, you know, kind of.
He doesn't really scream at the TV but just in his irritated way.
Flick.
Yeah, I know, right?
So yeah, that was Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
I bought a game on Steam that was dirt cheap last week.
Not during this whole autumn sale they've been doing, but last week.
They had a game called Magicka on sale for like $2.50, and you could even download the demo.
Or no, you downloaded the full game, and you could just play the full game for free through Sunday.
This is the kind of stuff Steam can let you do.
So I ended up buying the Uber edition for like $9.
It comes with all the expansions.
I liked Magicka.
It was cool.
It's kind of like...
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So it's interesting kind of learning about the combinations.
So exploration definitely plays heavy into this.
This is the game as well, and I know we talked about this on the show a while back, but it had some very strange expansions.
Like the first expansion for Magicka is Magicka Vietnam.
and it's the little magic characters in Vietnam and the joke is because all the shooter games end up having a Vietnam expansion so Magicka got a Vietnam expansion there's a lot of very tongue-in-cheekness the game is very tongue-in-cheek it's sharp-witted I think it was right after they announced the Battlefield Bad Company 2 Vietnam expansion
So, yeah, so I was... And then they did some other expansions after that.
So, yeah, I enjoyed Magicka, and it was fun to play.
You can play it online, too.
Like, Alan and I were doing co-op in the same room over Steam online.
It was pretty fun.
So you can play, like, I think up to four or six people at once.
And there's all these other modes I haven't even touched yet because, again, other games have distracted me.
But there's, like...
Challenge Modes, and PvP, I guess is a big element.
Because I got the Uber Edition, I got all these different Magicka types.
And what's funny is that one of them is like a Tron dude.
They all wear the little hooded robe things.
They look like little monks.
But this particular monk has the energy lines and carries an energy disc, right?
And I played that when I was playing online with Alan.
He couldn't heal me.
And we couldn't figure it out.
Why the hell can't you heal me?
I can heal you, but you can't heal me.
Well, it's because since I was playing as Tron dude, you don't heal me with life, you heal me with lightning.
So whenever he would shoot a lightning bolt at me, I would heal.
So just funny little quirks like that were in the game and kind of lead to the puzzle elements of Magicka.
So, um...
Out of everything out right now, you're playing that?
So we went to Evil G one day because we had a gift card we had to spend.
So we found a game that was the perfect amount of money and it was White Knight Chronicles 2.
I was there.
It was on sale.
Yeah, you were there.
You did come with us.
White Knight Chronicles 2 we bought on sale for $40 and it comes complete with the first game, which I did play a little bit before.
When it was actually done by Sony, but now this game has been out in Japan and Europe for a while, but D3 finally put it out here.
Because I guess the first game didn't do so hot, but it has a real cult following to it.
So now the second game's out.
It's a lot like...
the .hack games on PS2 you can play the first game all over well actually you couldn't even do this in the .hack games because they didn't come with each game but imagine if like the first .hack what .hack infection and the next one like imagine if they were bundled together you can either start the first game which is what they called the remastered version although I call it the they made the annoying text box slightly less annoying and a couple other little things you probably won't notice
or you could just start the second game at level 35.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura,
It's not a bad game, but it's just a... It does a lot of things, but none of them are best in class.
It's like a game that gets straight Bs across the board.
The story's not really in A. The graphics are pretty good.
The music's good, but it's not great.
The character design, it's neat, but there's a lot of repetition.
It's like it gets straight Bs, but he put it all together, and it makes for a really deep experience.
It's like Xanadu.
I guess.
I don't know, but yeah, I can't stop playing.
I'm just like grind, grind, grind, grind.
I could be playing Skyrim, yet I'm playing this game because it's like I have to beat story mode.
I have to get to level.
I have to get to the White Knight Chronicles 2.
I have to be able to play with people online.
I can't stop playing.
a couple other negatives I'll say about the game really disappointed that there was an online store mode where you buy things for your village like houses and scenery but this stuff will impact the amount of stuff that you can grow which in turn is what's for sale at your stores so that's my long way of saying you can buy your way to a competitive edge in this game
and it's not just that but they actually sell items at the Sony store that are like this coupon is good for 20% increased experience for one week so there's a lot of like really cheap stuff like that and I almost want to flunk the game on those grounds alone however I do have to realize there is this online component that they're not charging money for
that does have about the depth of Phantasy Star Universe, and Phantasy Star Universe does still charge money to this day.
Why they just don't go free-to-play, I don't know.
So I give it a slight pass on those grounds, because I feel like, okay, well, fair enough, they are providing a robust online component, they gotta make the money for that somewhere, I guess.
But I do frown on the fact that they sell things to give you a competitive edge.
That shit is just... As a gamer, it bothers me.
I don't like it in other games, too, so...
Let's see, Actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, wait, White Knot Chronicles 2 has both games?
I'm going to tell a friend that wants it to get that instead of the first one.
Oh, absolutely.
The first game is pointless at this point.
Like, if you can get it $10 used, awesome.
And you can import what you do in the first game into the second game.
You can do that.
You don't have to just start at level 35 because the level cap in the first game was 50.
So, you grind your way to 50 and then do it that way.
But, uh,
Yeah, there's really no point, and this game's probably not that expensive.
White Knight Chronicles 2 was $40 on sale, but that was a pre-Black Friday type sale.
When did we go to Evil G, DarkSakura?
Was that like Wednesday?
I think so, yeah.
I think so.
You can probably find it used even cheaper like somewhere else.
Maybe.
But be careful because it has an online pass called GeoNet.
So you can't do any of the online features without the – you get the one free with the new copy and then it's going to be $10 otherwise.
It was Sunday.
Sunday morning.
That's right because the show didn't happen.
Yeah.
Okay.
But we went in the morning because I was running away from the football game.
yeah yeah so anyway White Knight Chronicles 2 straight B's yet I can't stop playing it go figure and then here's a game that I've also been playing a lot of and it's Super Mario 3DS and I gotta say I'm just gonna be blunt this is my favorite Mario game in the past 20 years I think for real like I think this is my favorite Mario game since like Super Mario World I think
Um, it's great.
Like, if you own a 3DS, I don't know why you would not get this game.
Like, I seriously do not know why you would be a Nintendo supporter and not want Mario 3D Land.
It is outstanding.
The level design is fantastic.
There's a lot of throwbacks to a lot of things you see in the Mario series, as well as some new stuff, like the whole Boomerang Mario.
um but yeah I mean I can't stop thinking about the level design the level design is so good they're linear levels like what you would see in a Mario game yet they have that slight openness of like Mario 64 yet they're not too damn open like I think some of the levels in that game and even like Galaxy and Sunshine were like there definitely is that Mario linear path to it um
How's the 3D?
Believe it or not, it's neat.
I was not the biggest fan of Mario 64, and I've taken shit for that on this show over the years, and a lot of that was because I didn't like the transition from 2D to 3D.
Mario 64 was one of the first big 3D games, and I realize a lot of people disagree with me on that, and that's fine.
Every gamer gets their own opinion.
So I was a little worried about this at first, but...
I think because the levels still feel somewhat linear-esque to me, but still have a sense of openness to them, I'm not bothered by the 3D at all.
And the actual 3D effects are cool.
And they're with purpose in some places.
And there's some kind of puzzle rooms, for lack of a better term, that you actually kind of use 3D in.
Can you play it in 2D?
Yes.
Would it look as good?
No.
It doesn't look as good.
So you think they've really got the hang of the 3D now?
I do, and I'll tell you one thing I love, love, and I think all the 3DS games need to do this, is they have a switch now that not only can you adjust the intensity of the 3D, but with the switch of the D-pad, if you press the up arrow, then the 3D is up, like it's outward 3D, whereas if you hit the down arrow, it's inward 3D.
That's cool.
That may not make a lot of sense the way I'm saying it.
No.
But when you play it, you'll see what I mean.
It's instead of one will project, the other will immerse.
Yes.
And this can help some of the effects, like depending on your eyes.
Like sometimes I notice if I'm playing the projector 3D, there's these stages where these spiked ball things will kind of swing back and forth, like out.
Well, sometimes the 3DS does this thing where when they swing forth, your vision starts to split.
Get the ghosting.
Yeah, you see the ghosting and all that, but if you do the inward 3D, I don't see that at all.
That's probably how I would have to play the whole thing, given that every other thing I've played on a 3DS, I get the problem all the time.
You can kind of choose what 3D works for you.
Okay.
So, let's see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and looking at some comments here.
DDR Dollar Bill says, please tell me it's not like Mario 64.
It's not like Mario 64.
In my opinion, it's better.
And there's going to be a lot of people that disagree with me on that, and that's fine.
Let's see, SJ100Matt says, Rob, you're not the only person I've heard say this.
Let's see, Actdeft says, I liked Super Mario 64, but I get why people don't like it.
Heck, my favorite Mario game is still Super Mario World.
Mine too.
Mario 3D Land is not without flaw.
For instance, the street pass stuff is weird.
Like, you have these mystery boxes that are very similar to the Toad Houses where if you can clear a mystery box in like 10 or 15 seconds, you might get a chance at a bonus coin.
And I guess the deal with is that if you street pass with people, all it does is it's like they give you a new mystery box.
And it's not necessarily one that they've played or I don't think it really is anything but...
Hey, you got a little bonus because you street passed with someone.
So that's kind of a little like, boy, that seems somewhat forced.
So to that, I say derp derp, but it doesn't really detract from the single player game experience, which is still great.
I mean, street passing will allow you to get more bonus coins, I think, which will allow you to get some of the levels and stuff.
But if you're really good at single player, you could still do it.
You know, one week from today, Mario Kart 7.
I know.
See, there's been a lot of skepticism about the 3DS, and rightfully so.
Because this game blows any of the launch titles out of the fucking water, including Street Fighter 4.
Yeah, they launched with this?
They should have launched with this.
Now, maybe there's a method to the madness.
Maybe they didn't want to have the sellouts, which would seem weird for Nintendo, but maybe they wanted to launch it early.
and have this slow build, I don't know or maybe they legitimately thought it would launch heavier than it did, but if this game can't sell the 3DS nothing will it's as simple as that if the 3DS, if this game does not carry 3DS sales
There really is nothing else they can put out on it.
I truly believe that.
This Mario game is about as good as a Nintendo game gets.
It's better than Galaxy.
It's better than New Super Mario Bros.
Wii.
I really think so.
Is it better than Sunshine?
Because Sunshine was pretty epic.
Yes, it's better than Sunshine.
No shine, get!
Some people think Sunshine was ass.
I think it was a lot better.
I don't get how you can like Mario 64 and hate Sunshine, but I guess it has to do with the whole water element, but whatever.
I actually like 64 a whole lot.
I like 64, but I don't think it's... I like this game better.
I really do.
this is going to be one of the best games of the year period this is a great year for games like I'm seriously sitting back going how can I choose between Mario 3D Land Portal 2 and Skyrim which one of these games is the best game of the year because they are all fucking good like really fucking good
and there's some games I haven't even touched yet.
I'm hearing amazing things about Zelda Skyward Sword, which I'm sure a lot of us are.
I don't think any of us in the room, oddly enough, have touched that yet, but I'm hoping to get my hands on it before the end of the year.
There's a lot I still haven't played.
This has been a great year for games.
It really has.
Thankfully, as far as releases go, aside from Mario Kart 7, there's no real big major releases in games until the end of January.
so you got a few weeks to catch up on some stuff at least so Salacious Pop in our chatroom says Sunshine was pretty terrible to be honest but I also hated 64 I didn't see his thoughts on this one but I can tell you since we're playing on the same cartridge he's been playing quite a bit he's about as far in the game as I am so I'm thinking he's liking this one
so I'm hearing there's a lot of stuff I don't want to like spoil things more than I probably already have but I hear there's a lot of stuff you can kind of unlock if you do really well in a lot of levels and I think that's great it kind of gives the game some value and obviously there's the coins that you can go back and get and so forth but I get the sense that unlike you know 64 where you had to play the same level over and over to get the stars and all that like if you miss
if you don't get a single coin in the damn game I think you can still beat it I think you can still fight Bowser and beat the game but you will miss like 10 bonus levels you'll miss the chance to unlock the extra gate you know there's just I think there's a lot to build for so anyhow
yeah good gaming week and I still have to play more Skyrim I really do and then after the Civilization sale on Steam the other day I was like we need to have another Civ night so anyway it's a great time to be a gamer it really is
Well, I have one more little thing.
Sure, what do you want to throw out there before we get into some gaming news?
Well, when you were talking about Umlaut, I forgot to mention that I designed the badges and tickets this year.
So everyone needs to go and hold on to my work forever.
So your graphic design chatter on this show is not for naught because now your stuff is actually going to be a part of this gaming event.
That's really cool.
Yeah, and no, you don't get a preview, everyone.
You know, I can't show anybody.
Yeah, you have to go to the event and find out.
Rob's seen it, though.
Well, I can't say anything about it.
Go to the show and find out.
You can tell them it looks good.
Yes, it looks very professional.
It does.
It looks very professional.
And I think I don't know how much I can and can't say on air, but I will just say, understanding the source material, you did a really good job making everything consistent.
and kind of putting your own spin on it.
So I think that's awesome.
That was the goal, branding.
Yeah.
That was the big thing.
But it was actually really fun to do and probably one of the fastest I've ever gotten anything accomplished.
But yeah, so for people who actually can't make it, they'll be up on my portfolio after the event's over.
Okay.
I'm supposed to be doing something as well, but I don't think I'm at liberty to say yet.
I haven't seen... Once the official word is out there, I'll be able to say something.
So that's all I can say.
But I really hope you're going this year.
Everyone be there.
If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you really should go to Umlaut.
Fly out.
Join us.
All right.
Quick housekeeping.
Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
Follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
And hey, we're now on Google+.
That happened, the show we weren't at last week, but we are now on Google+, as well.
Unfortunately, Google did not smarten up and let you have a custom URL, but it's really easy to find us on there.
Just in your little Google Plus search box, look for Orange Lounge Radio, and it'll probably pop up by the time you get Orange and L in there, so...
Keep an eye out for that and Plus One Us and all that stuff on Google+.
All right, let's get into some gaming news.
We're like, what, an hour into the show with all the games that we played this week?
Let's actually get into some gaming news.
It's actually a good thing we spent an hour talking about gaming weeks because our show is a little bit abbreviated this week because of the website problems.
We don't have quite as much news as usual.
And it is also a slow news week because, you know, it's been a big holiday here in the States.
There's a few big stories we're going to get to here.
I will say also, though, look forward to this in Part B tonight.
Listless returns in Part B tonight.
We love to fill slow news weeks with OLR games.
So Listless coming up tonight in Part B. Okay, sorry Loki, your turn.
Okay, so Sony is reporting that the PlayStation Move has shipped 9 million units and a million of those have been over the past half year.
Of course, there's a lot of funky math when you go to look at this.
One, it's unit ship, not necessarily sold.
And two, unlike... You can't compare this to the Kinect, where Kinect is a solid unit, and that's all you need to use the Kinect.
The Move has multiple components, so you can have up to four Move controllers per system.
And I'm not even sure if they're counting the navigation controllers or whatever else to go along with that.
So...
Who knows what that necessarily means.
9 million move units shipped.
I don't know.
But, hey, it's not bad.
I mean, 9 million is a good number, even if it is, you know, 4 per system.
Alright.
I mean, I don't know.
It's just doing better than I thought it was.
Not bad.
Ours is hooked up now.
I haven't played it yet.
I still have the Move controllers, but I actually have no Move.
Well, aside from LittleBigPlanet 2 obviously supports it, but I don't have any Move required games yet.
But I don't really play my PlayStation 3 that much either.
That's why I loan out all my PlayStation 3 games.
Outro Outro Outro
Well, you know what I'm going to be playing a lot of in the next few days?
Sega Saturn!
Why?
Christmas nights.
Oh, that's right.
I forgot that's like your yearly little thing.
Your fun thing.
All right.
Well, as far as the move goes, though, do you think the move is a wash at this point?
Or do you think they're still going to try and breathe some life into it?
Um, I think that it, there's still plenty of life to be brought into it because after all, um, they could, I mean, they're, they support it in most of their first party games.
Um, you know, like Resistance and Killzone and, uh, SOCOM all support the move and plus, you know, they have a lot of, um, games coming out that are going to be supporting, that are pretty big like, you know, Bioshock Infinite is going to be supporting the move.
I think that they do have a good grasp on how to use the move with hardcore games per se.
Better than the Kinect, that's for sure.
I'll give Sony props for that because the way that they've done Kinect support for the hardcore games, if you will, like Halo and Forza 4...
it sucks it's terrible I mean head tracking sounds like a good idea not implemented very well at all and voice commands and halo no it's stupid it's absolutely terrible do you think it's because the Kinect didn't end up being hardware wise what it should have been like it should have been a better camera in there
I don't even know if that's the case.
Really, if that is the problem, couldn't they revise the heart?
Wait for the next Xbox at this point.
I don't know.
I guess it could have been better, but
Sopa Stop Online Piracy Act
If you're not aware, basically there is an act that's being explored.
It hasn't passed yet, but it's one of those things that's going through the committees, which means it likely could go for a vote even before possibly Congress takes a break for the holidays coming up in December.
And in short, the Stop Online Piracy Act will allow the government to force...
internet service providers to basically blacklist websites make it unable to access websites domain names based on the fact if they are offering infringing material or not you know what they're trying to stop is they basically want to shut down things like the Pirate Bay like that'll be one of the first things that gets thrown up there is that they'll block that domain so that you can no longer pirate if you've been using that site you know videos and movies and so forth and so on
Um, but this is causing a lot of controversy.
And, um, the fact is, it's kind of like how they are censoring things.
And well, a, a lot of people are saying straight up when you talk censorship of the internet, it's like, dude, this isn't China.
Why are we censoring the internet?
Blocking websites?
That's, that's, that's a China thing.
That's what they do there.
Why are we doing this?
and, you know, obviously what they're trying to do is stop piracy but unfortunately, you know, this act, I feel, kind of leaves it very vague because my understanding is that if a company were to complain that this website is offering infringing material, that website could just get shut down.
Hold on a minute.
We have something here in this country called due process.
Well, actually, I believe they do.
It's not as simple as they complain about.
I think it does actually have to go in front of a judge to say, okay, here's our evidence that this site's doing that.
But it's not just sites that have pirated material.
It's sites that they claim facilitate finding that.
So like Google, for example.
And Pfizer's behind this because it's also targeting websites that sell, like, fake Viagra.
Pfizer's the drug company that created Viagra.
And, you know, how much spam mail do we get every day about go to this Canadian pharmacy website that sells Viagra or whatever it is?
Yeah, but we're still going to get that spam.
I mean, that's not going to go away.
God, if it was going to get rid of the spam, that would be awesome, but no.
There's a couple ways – and why –
I didn't even really get to the story, I was giving the background on this A lot of gaming companies have come out actually in support of this Like Nintendo's in support of it, I believe Microsoft finally came out First they weren't, now they are Sony's in support of it, a lot of the game companies Hollywood loves it, Hollywood wants this Hollywood's the one trying to push this through Hollywood's trying to push it through
Sopa needs to, quote,
Balance key innovation, privacy, and security considerations with the need to thwart the threat rogue websites pose.
Also, quote, And I totally agree with this guy.
Thanks for watching!
That's not what we do here.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Like, I'm really torn because whereas I'm like, okay, if they want to stop piracy, they have a right to stop piracy.
Well, they can't really stop piracy.
What they're doing is they're just blocking access to these sites because these sites operate in countries that don't have the same piracy laws as we do.
So really, as far as jurisdiction goes in the U.S., there's nothing they can do about it other than block them.
That's it.
And what's great about this, you know, act, because you can obviously tell that the person that drafted this is really...
It only blocks domain names.
You know what domain names are, right?
They're just basically easy ways for you to remember an IP address.
It's your cell phone book.
Seriously, in this day and age, how many people actually have all the numbers in their cell phone book memorized?
Very few.
You might know your parents.
You might know your significant other, but that's about it.
I don't know my significant other's phone number.
I don't.
And here's the thing, though.
That's okay.
I don't know your significant other's phone number either.
It's in my phone.
Okay.
There's a bunch of things that they're assuming to be true.
First off, these websites or whatever, obviously if they feel that they're going to be threatened or taken down or whatever, they're just going to give you the IP address.
You type in the IP address, boom, you're at the website.
It's not blocked.
I think at the end of the day, you have to hold these websites responsible and that's the only way to stop the problem.
But it's not that easy because they're not all in America.
Here's the problem though.
much like piracy and stuff they're going to try all these things to try to stop piracy but all it's going to do is hurt other people and not necessarily get rid of the piracy problem the problem is just like everything else with piracy just like we've seen time and time again
Every time they've tried to do something, such as let's say Ubisoft DRM, right?
You're not connected to the internet, the game shuts down.
Pirates had it cracked in two days.
Who did that shit ultimately hurt?
The legitimate users.
And that's going to be the problem with SOPA, is that the pirates will find their way around it in two days.
Who's gonna ultimately get hurt?
The legitimate users who are trying to access a website like allgames.com who suddenly got yanked because, I don't know, fucking Namco or somebody didn't like that they were playing the music from a 25-year-old video game or something, you know?
Like, legitimate people are gonna end up getting hurt.
That's the problem.
And if it's anything like, you know, I've read kind of these horror stories about some file sharing sites where, you know, Warner Brothers, they were sending cease and desist basically for files that weren't even their properties.
It just happened to have, like, names of their stuff.
Part of the title was share their name.
I called my hard drive Batman.
So Warner Brothers wants to shut me down.
You know, something like that.
Or, like, you know, even, like, YouTube.
Well, YouTube videos now, I mean, obviously, that they can pull it if, you know, there's a complaint or something like that.
But it's just going to be really hard for them to do it.
And I just have a feeling that even if this law passes, I don't think it's going to do anything.
Did those, like, what was it?
The digital, I don't even remember what the hell it was.
The Millennium... I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, basically the DVD copying thing.
Did that stop people from copying DVDs?
Nope.
Nothing.
So...
People find a way around it, and it's just, it's unfortunate.
If you don't like the direction these folks are heading in, it's time to vote them out.
Because, you know, I gotta admit, I'm sitting here going, I understand where this might be an issue or whatever, but I can think of a lot of things that are a bigger issue right now, and that is like, you know, I don't know, the fact that the whole country's going down the shitter, and people are very upset about that, you know, the whole thing.
And...
I get the... Watch out, Rob, you might get pepper sprayed.
And then locked into a detainment camp.
We do live just down the street from UC Davis, you know.
Not literally down the street, but we're not that far away, all things considered.
You know, we used to joke on the... Isn't it a long-running joke on this show?
The People's Republic of Davis abandoned all hope, you enter here, and look at what fucking happened!
And you all can see it.
But anyway... Anyway, outside of that joke...
Yeah, obviously, I do get the element though that Hollywood is pissed because piracy is hurting their industry, because it is.
But I think to an extent, there's two things hurting that industry.
You could say the piracy is one, but the other thing that's hurting them is their failure to adapt is killing traditional broadcast networks.
Well, their way of adapting is, well, we're just going to reduce the amount of options that you have.
And actually, the stuff that they're doing on the retail side of things is hurting them.
Like, for example...
um you know there's the 28 day windows which will soon enough be 60 day windows as soon as those contracts are up next year um 60 day windows for you know movies being in Redbox and also on Netflix and also uh Warner Brothers um started all rental customers are not able to get stuff from you know a distribution stuff until 60 days after the fact including which is great uh
One of the first titles to do this, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2.
Just two weeks after that window is up, they're pulling Harry Potter out of circulation.
All of them.
Gone.
Out of circulation.
Because you have to buy it now.
You have to because it's going out of circulation so they can re-release it later on in a special Uber edition or something.
but the fact that there's not rental options I mean not that there really is rental options because any rental store can go to the store and go buy it but it's limited because you know and when you can't find it you're like shit I'll just download it
Yeah, and it's pretty easy to download stuff, and unfortunately, you know, those customers would have rented it, hey, maybe might have liked it, and went and bought it, and still there may be people that download a really crappy copy, and they're like, hey, you know what, that movie's pretty good, I'm gonna go buy it, but it just kind of leaves a sour taste in people's mouths, especially with all the fucking tons of re-releases, or remakes, or
I think everyone needs to be voted out.
Start from scratch.
Frisbee says Hollywood is irrelevant to entertainment anymore very interesting quote very interesting and very true I think in many ways because the whole well look at what we're doing here we're doing a radio program we're doing a podcast that people can listen to in their car without having to ever turn on the radio what about web shows like the guild
or viral videos.
People at this point would rather watch cute kitty laughing and giggling videos or the dog that sounds like he's really saying I love you than watching Whitney.
There's a lot more entertainment options out there than there were say 30 years ago or whatever.
Um, you know, before when it was just like, okay, you've got radio, you've got movies, and you have TV.
That's it.
You can read a newspaper or a funny book or something like that.
But now it's just the internet.
And, I mean, the internet's just got tons of content.
Anything you're looking for, it's just right there.
So that's why these TV shows, if it's a media, you know, a very mediocre TV show, no one gives a fuck.
No one's gonna watch that.
Like, Whitney.
It was terrible.
It just happens to come on sometimes after the office is done.
I'm like, ah!
Horrible show!
Off with you!
I just want to sort of, I guess, kind of rein things back.
Everyone pay attention who you vote for.
Don't vote a party ticket because that's also just as dangerous.
Because that's how assholes get snuck into government positions.
Stop and take an effort to read who supports what.
Get a take-home ballot or an absentee ballot.
That's how I vote every year.
Do your homework.
Exactly.
And then double-check every box that you mark right before you mark it.
That's the advantage of taking one of those home.
You have time to research.
You list out the pros and cons.
But the biggest thing is actually put some damn effort into your future.
How many people just don't vote because, oh, I don't care.
Or, oh, it's too much work for me to go and mark some check boxes or read up on this stuff.
Oh, it's too much work.
Or, I'm going to buy this product because it's cheap and I don't care if they outsource all of their customer service.
That's why it's cheap.
Think about what you do before you fucking do it.
And put effort into your life.
Did Dan just laugh from the other room?
Yeah, because he's mad at me because I don't have a job yet.
You're expressing yourself in other ways.
I'd like to express myself at a job.
Someone hire me too while you're at it.
Well, you might not be getting paid for it, but you at least have the fuzzy wuzzy, I contributed to a good cause.
Addendum.
I want a job that will pay me too.
But you don't mind the charity work at all either.
I don't mind the charity work, but you don't know how many...
Because Rob's my dealer.
I am not going to live a life that I find morally objectionable.
I bet you could get like 10 votes from OLR listeners.
Alright, moving on.
Alright, in all seriousness.
Can I do my story now?
Yes, you may do your story now.
Thank you.
We need fuzzy wuzzy happy news.
How about Indie Game Music Bundle?
Yay, 10 albums for a dollar.
There's now the Indie Game Music Bundle, which is like the Humble Indie Bundle, but you get 10 items for a dollar, including stuff from Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV Minecraft.
Um, that's, uh, Minecraft Volume Alpha, uh, Cobalt EP, Super Meat Boy Digital Special Edition Soundtrack, Impostor Nostalgia, Ravenmark's Scourge of Estelion, Ares Extinction Agenda, Return All Robots, Mighty Milky Way, Mighty Flip Channel, uh, Champ, sorry, PPPPPPP, the VVVVVVVVOST, and Tree of Knowledge.
You said PP.
And if you contribute more than $10, you also get Wind Up Night, Binding of Isaac, 72 Minutes of Fame, Milk Snake, Anti-Gravity Extreme Road Trip, and Contingency.
Okay, seriously?
For just the Super Meat Boy and VVVV or PPPV, whatever soundtracks, is like worth that whole dollar like 20 times over?
You know how I'd pronounce that?
Huh.
The VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
Alright, so let's see, let's start off with some more cheerful stuff, hopefully.
So basically, there may be a sequel to Command & Conquer possibly coming from Bioware.
It was teased during a... They actually had a real brief video on teasing, I guess.
It was the Spike Video Games Awards, right around the corner.
And then, of course, there's also a screenshot that's out there.
Um...
Thanks for watching!
Victory Games.
They're working on a new strategy title, which people are thinking, hmm, maybe that's what it's called.
Command & Conquer game?
Hmm, perhaps.
Also, I guess they have another Medal of Honor thing working with one of their other studios, Danger Close.
So, lots of...
and different studios working under EA.
I remember at one point, EA was just buying up, not necessarily buying up everybody, but publishing everybody.
They have, obviously, the new Respawn Entertainment from the former execs of Infinity Ward.
They're making something.
Obviously, Valve is doing a lot of stuff with them.
Yeah.
and then Crytek as well lots of stuff there but at least the Bioware game now of course right now they don't know if Command & Conquer is really the game or not or if it's something else but the Bioware game is going to be revealed December 10th during the Spike Video Game Awards and like I said they had a very very very brief trailer of something with tanks it has tanks in it How do you feel about Command & Conquer with Dialogue Trees?
Weren't you a big fan of Command & Conquer?
I soon remember this.
I used to be.
Red Alert.
Red Alert was awesome.
But I haven't played Command & Conquer in a long time.
In fact, the last one that came out, I just didn't really care for.
Well, it could be good, though.
If they turned it over to a new studio to kind of give it a creative energy reboot, that could be a good thing, right?
Yeah, and I'm not even sure.
I mean, there's a lot of studios working on stuff.
It could be Bioware that's doing it.
I think Bioware is actually going to be a different game altogether.
The thought is, though, that Victory Games is going to be doing this, but I have no idea who the hell Victory Games is.
so I guess they're a new strategy studio and you know strategy games for EA I mean really there's there was a Lord of the Rings games that they had and Command & Conquer so this Lord of the Rings is not part of you know EA anymore I'm gonna go on limb and say probably gonna be a Command & Conquer game at some point or maybe hey a new IP maybe a new IP you never know that could be too that'd be good
All right, well, let's move on to another story, and this is about a possible answer to Smash Bros.
that Sony is making.
Now, I should say this.
I always thought that Move game, what was that called?
Move Fighters or something Fighters, the one that was on Sony?
I thought that was supposed to be their answer to Smash Bros., but I guess not really.
What?
Which one?
What the hell is that game that's on Sony Move?
Is it Pocket Fighters?
No.
Thank you for watching!
There apparently is something a little more, I don't know if you want to say mainstream or what, but I guess something that's a little more directly, I don't want to say either a Smash Bros.
ripoff, but something that's supposedly in development.
There's a lot of stuff that's leaking through this blog called PaulGaleNetwork.com.
I'm not sure this gentleman's relation to the gaming industry, but a lot of the other gaming blogs have picked up and ran with this, where Title Fight is apparently the development...
Work in Progress, name of this.
And some information that's in this, it is very similar to Super Smash Bros.
It's the special moves and all those attacks you kind of do the same way.
Apparently there are some characters already noticed in this, and they kind of come in light and heavy flavors, meaning like who moves slowly, who moves lightly.
Heavier characters include Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal,
Uh, Colonel Male Reddick, Fat Princess.
Some of the lighter characters include Parappa the Rappa.
That's kind of awesome if he's in a fighting game.
Kratos, Sly Cooper, and Nathan Drake.
Um, not sure if there's anything about, uh, a story mode or anything like that at this time.
But, uh, yeah.
I guess, um...
We need Michael Michael is the player of
Who takes down the controller and it's all like be a part of the game or whatever.
And some people are saying maybe this is teasing this whole Sony smorgasbord of characters, this project.
Because I could certainly see this as being the big Sony reveal of next year's E3.
Because now that the Vita will already be out there, maybe there's going to be something about this game and how it works between the Vita.
It could be a Vita title for all we know.
But how it works between the Vita and the PS3 and all that.
So, could be neat, right?
It could be neat.
I love the idea of characters like Parappa the Rapper.
Like, I kind of forget about how many characters Sony really has in their pocket.
I wonder if he's going to give you a paper cut.
He might.
It could be something he does, or Umjam Malami.
If she's in it, I'm there.
But we'll see.
Milk can!
yeah my guitar is in my mind it would be interesting to see too if they were able to get from some of the other developers you know kind of like how Smash Brothers had Solid Snake and what was it in the commercial Sonic Sonic hello was in the game it would be interesting to see if Sony could get things that were very iconically Sony like Cloud from Final Fantasy 7 Final Fantasy 7 was a huge Sony thing because that was when the franchise jumped over to Playstation could be interesting could be very interesting
All right.
All right.
What are we doing now?
Moving on to some release dates, right?
Let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out to a store this week.
I imagine it's dying down significantly, but let's see.
Yeah, incredibly dying down.
A few things.
There's some cool new combo packs they have with controller and game bundles.
they did this kind of last year and so Sony's got some of those one of them is Encharted the dual pack with Encharted 1 and 2 and then you get a DualShock controller I believe that's blue and then they have one that's in black that comes with the Resistance 1 and 2 dual pack and there's also one with the God of War Origins collection that's I believe red those are all on Playstation 3 um
Let's see here.
Jaws Ultimate Predator on Wii and 3DS.
Face Racers Photo Finish on 3DS.
Nano Assault on 3DS.
But really the only 3DS game you should really care about is Mario Kart 7.
And that's coming out one week from today.
That's it.
Oh my god, one week from today?
That's awesome.
One week from today.
I can't believe it.
XBOX 360 REVELATIONS
Sonic Generations, Shiro no Jiku is the subtitle for it over there, comes out this week, as well as King of Fighters 13 makes its way out in Japan this week.
Also, one other game on the 360 this week, a game called Ever 17 comes out in regular and limited edition flavors.
I'm not sure what this game is all about.
It's an adventure game, but I'm noticing it's, you know, anime chicks in schoolgirl outfits, and in this one clip, I kid you not, I'm looking, she's holding a hamster and talking to the hamster, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And then the third one's out.
And so I start reading the entire Wiki, Evangelion Wiki.
Just like, oh, that's it.
Okay, cool.
Going to the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus comes out this week as well as the Sonic Generations and King of Fighters 13 releases.
Also on the Sony system this week, Tekken Hybrid.
You know, I saw this at Target.
We have a version here in America that I think just came out this week.
And I had, like, Alan picked it up off the shelf and was like, I didn't know that this was coming out.
And I was like, shit, I didn't know about this one either.
But yeah, this is, what the hell, it's like tag tournament and...
It's Tag Tournament HD.
There's a Tag Tournament 2 preview and then also Tech and Bullying, but I think that's also part of Tag Tournament.
And it's all in 3D.
Well, no, it's just those games.
Plus, it's also Tekken, the Tekken 3D animated movie that just came out as a 3D Blu-ray.
So a hybrid as far as it's both a movie and both a game.
So you can even take that game and play it in a regular Blu-ray player and you can watch the movie in 3D if you want.
Or you can just... What's great, though, is remember the new Tekken game that's coming out on the 3DS will also have that movie in 3D on it.
That was pretty cool.
Gotta hit up my Namco guy.
Alright, just a reminder that PS Vita is three weeks away, December 17th.
In Japan.
In Japan, not here, but I am doing Japanese releases right now.
Sony PSP this week since that's still the Sony system only big releases Kamen Rider Climax Heroes 4Z comes out this week that's from Namkai Bando and it's an action related title that looks like kind of a 3D-ish 3D-esque robot fighting game kind of like Ultraman style characters all fighting
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Crayon Shin-chan, Uchu de Achu, Yuujou no Oba Karate Crayon Shin-chan is old school manga and anime What was the last part of that?
I love this No Oba Karate, it makes it sound like it's a karate crayon game And it is an action based game and it's based on that old anime Kind of like a platformer, looks a little bit like your Rayman kind of platformer game
So that's it for releases in Japan.
For the UK, really not a whole bunch.
We have on the 30th, Darkstalkers for PlayStation 3, which is kind of cool.
And then on December 1st, there's Infinity Blade 2.
December 2nd, Ace Combat, Assault Horizon Legacy, Assassin's Creed Revelations for PC, Mario Kart 7, and Super Pokemon Rumble.
That's it.
Just a few more stories for you guys and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.
But first, DarkSakura.
Well, there have been a lot of pre-orders for the Vita in Hong Kong.
Basically, they are the second city that are getting the system.
And, well, there's mobbing in online stores that can't meet the traffic and...
Lots of stuff going on.
But it's, I guess, not nearly as bad as getting pepper sprayed in the face over $2 waffle iron.
But hey, what this basically means is that the early demand is there.
This could be kind of a big deal.
Yarp.
It could very well be.
And I guess that's really all we can say about it for now.
I know.
I haven't had any real reaction out of it, just that it's sold.
Maybe people are just too busy hiding under their desk playing it.
It's interesting to know if the system's going to do well or if it's going to fall flat, so we'll see.
Well, hopefully.
Alright.
I have high hopes for it.
Seems to be doing pretty well.
Yeah, I'm definitely going to get one.
Loki.
So there's been a lot of talk of piracy this week.
And one person, of course, to speak out about it is Gabe Newell, the head of Valve.
And basically, one of the things he says is piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem.
We think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy.
Piracy is always a service problem, not a pricing problem.
For example, if a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24-7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says that the product is region-locked,
will come to your country three months after a U.S.
release and can only be purchased at a brick-and-mortar store, then the pirate service is more valuable.
Most DRM solutions diminish the value of the product by either directly restricting a customer's use or by creating uncertainty.
So basically kind of alluding to Assassin's Creed 2 and the Ubisoft DRM, which we mentioned earlier, pretty much got destroyed in a few months
A few days.
And then, of course, you know, they're saying, you know, Steam isn't without its own problems.
Saints Row the Third, you know, used, I guess, Steamworks and stuff and is unavailable on the UK Steam store for reasons that THQ are yet to elaborate on.
So that kind of sucks that they don't have it yet.
Yeah.
but I mean Steam's not perfect either because their stuff gets pirated just as well.
A lot of people seem to kind of be on board with Steam.
Yeah.
Sales help.
I was going to elaborate real quick because it's not one of the stories that we had earlier but some other people were talking piracy and funny enough it's also Ubisoft and their latest game to be coming out well
Ever delayed game to be coming out, I Am Alive.
They were saying that, well, we're not going to put it on PC because... Piracy issues.
Basically...
The creative director, Stanislas Metra, has basically said that PC piracy makes the financial viability of a game on the platform uncertain.
And Ubisoft's previously announced title, I guess, is only planned for consoles.
And of course, that would be I Am Alive.
It says, we heard loud and clear that PC gamers are bitching about there being no version for them.
Interesting that they used bitching in their official statement.
It says, but are these people just making noise because there's no version or because it's a game they actually want to play?
Would they buy it if we made it?
And he continues saying that if 50,000 PC players buy the game, it's not worth the cost of putting a team of 12 on the project for three months.
It's hard because there's so much piracy and so few people are playing PC games that we have to precisely weigh it up against the cost of making it.
Of course, that pissed off everybody.
All sorts of people.
What's great, though, is shortly afterwards, after everyone completely complained about that, he backpedaled on that.
He's saying...
You know, let's see here.
Honestly, which game maker would not love to see his game to be playable on as many platforms and as by many people as possible?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I bet, and even though the company's not very vocal about this, and for good reason, obviously you see all this backlash, I honestly truly believe a big part of the delay for PC was so that consoles got the jump.
Because it's all about playing it, and this goes back to Gabe Newell's point about convenience and getting it as soon as possible and the releases and all that.
People want to play it now.
And I think because it's on the consoles early, I think it really helps.
I mean, nothing's ever going to stop piracy, but I think it helps turn a lot of people away from it.
I mean, certainly piracy happens on the consoles too, but it's a lot harder.
And Ubisoft further digs into themselves deeper by...
Skipping Ghost Recon Future Soldier on PC as well because piracy.
They even said they're going to do Ghost Recon Online.
When we started Ghost Recon Online, we were thinking about Ghost Recon Future Soldier having something ported in the classic way without any deep development because we know that 95% of our consumers will pirate the game.
So we said, okay, we'll have to change our mind.
well that's very positive that your game you feel it's just going to be pirated like crazy
We're giving away most of the content for free because there's no barrier to entry.
This is talking about Ghost Recon Online.
To the users that are traditionally playing the game by getting it through Pirate Bay, we said, okay, go ahead, guys.
This is what you're asking for.
We've listened to you.
We're going to give you this experience.
It's easy to download.
There's no DRM that will pollute your experience.
So basically, they're like, well, there's nothing we can do, so we're just going to stop.
So we've designed a free-to-play game.
Yeah.
Interesting tactic.
You know, as much as I think people want to hate this guy, I think it's somewhat of a fair response.
I really do.
I mean, that is, but I am sorry.
I am alive, though.
First off, it's running in older.
It's not like they have to create the engine totally from scratch.
It's the Splinter Cell Conviction engine.
And it's also a game that's been delayed and delayed and delayed, and I don't think it's a game that really a lot of people are like, oh my god, I gotta play this.
I think they're just pissed off that they're saying, oh, well, no one plays PC games.
I think there's a lot of people who disagree with you.
All right.
I'm going to our chat room for some comments on some various stories we've been talking about because obviously we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
Except everyone.
Usually our chat room is at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, but due to website issues tonight, we are giving you the long way of getting there, which is going on to IRC, the Game Surge Network, and we are at Channel Orange Lounge.
Or you know what?
For real, if you really don't know how to get there, just go to chat.allgames.com and ask them, how do I join Orange Lounge?
They'll tell you.
They're nice.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Interesting perspective because you might say, oh no, that can't be it.
But that kind of shit happens in America too.
Like when the Wii's first came out and hell, the Xboxes.
Remember when people were buying up the limited Xbox supplies and then reselling them for twice as much?
This shit happens with new tech all the time.
So I could believe that.
I can actually really believe that.
So we'll see.
I guess that isn't necessarily an indicator of how strong something's going to sell because...
people tried to do that with the 3DS and it didn't work so well for them I don't think they made money on that so there you go Kaijudo in chat says there is only one way to stop piracy make everything free yes Kaijudo I need you to make me a sandwich and don't you expect me to pay you for it just teasing
But he does go on to say it will never happen.
Piracy will never... It will never happen.
No one will... Nowhere will piracy ever stop.
So please stop torturing us with your shitty attempts at DRM.
All right.
Let's move on.
from a website, damlag.com, and it's an article about game developers, you need to take your demos more seriously.
And of course, now that I'm trying to bring it up in studio, it's not loading, the joys of live radio and internet timeouts.
I did read the article a little bit before the show.
I think an ad is trying to prevent this thing from popping up all the way or something.
The internet's working.
Yeah, I know.
No, the internet's working fine.
Amazing!
Damn people
So apparently this demo is talking about the Rayman Origins demo had recently... Oh, it's working for you?
Fantastic.
It's not coming up on the computer over there.
All right.
So it's talking about how the Rayman Origins demo was really good.
And the author of the article at Damlag.com was talking about how he's played through the demo several times and how it's just a great game.
It kind of has elements of New Super Mario Bros.
Wii and mixing with the original Rayman and so forth.
I didn't really know about this game before.
Sure, I heard a little bit about it at E3, but I'm kind of throwing this in there.
Let's face it, it's a really crowded time of year.
There's a lot of video games out right now.
It's really kind of hard to get the attention.
The article talks about how developers usually think a demo is an afterthought if they even bother to put one out at all.
Um, and then talks about, you know, the article goes on to talk about how, um, you know, if, if you can get a customer to really experience the game, or even a demo that's mid-game, citing like Heavenly Sword, something that kind of takes not just the beginning of the game, but something that's a little bit in the middle of the game, um, that's a really good demo.
And then some...
and so on.
So whatever happened to a good old-fashioned demo?
Because a lot of games don't even bother with them.
Peggle Extreme, I mean, if you want to look at that, that came out with all of the Valve branding on it.
But it was, in essence, a free demo because it says, hey, if you really liked playing this, and you get, you know, I think like 10 levels or so of Peggle.
It says, hey, if you like this, you know, try out the real thing.
Here you go.
So PopCap did it.
Mm-hmm.
Well, the reason why I wanted to talk about this story a little bit is I kind of wanted to ask you guys, how important is a demo for you guys in influencing your game buying decisions?
I mean, do you like to use reviews?
Do you just kind of jump in if it's cheap?
Do you use game demos or what?
I'll kind of answer this is that I do like game demos.
I don't think they're necessarily the most important thing in selling a game.
because I think especially now that we live in a day and age where we have like Gamefly and hell even now streaming games thanks to like OnLive and so forth OnLive especially is interesting because now your demo can just be oh play an hour of it for free or something like what Steam did over the weekend with Magica so I think there's a lot of that evolving but I'm not going to lie a really good demo can absolutely sell a game absolutely because it leaves you wanting more you know
Well, on top of that, you also get an idea of edits that they've made in games, too.
Because a lot of times a demo's not going to have all the edits that make it into the final game.
And if you are clever and can get into the information on the disc, you can get more out of it.
But, I mean, we've got a pile of PlayStation Magazine demos in the vault.
Oh yeah, those PlayStation demos are always the bomb.
Those are great.
I've played so much Jumping Flash.
From the demo disc that came with my friend's ex-boyfriend's PlayStation.
Well, how many people bought, what was it, like Brave Fencer Mushashi or whatever just because it came with a Final Fantasy VIII demo?
Yes.
What game got the Final Fantasy VII demo?
Can't remember.
Tobal.
Tobal.
and that sold a lot just because of the demo too.
But Toeball actually wasn't a bad game.
Yeah, I know.
I really wish they'd make a new Toeball.
They did a second one.
Well, I know they did a second one and it was awesome but I really wish they'd make a new Toeball.
Going to the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Actdeft says, I usually ask people.
Jvmon says, I use demos for franchises I'm not familiar with.
If it wasn't for demos, I would never have bought Blue Dragon or Cold Step Saga.
Cold Step Saga is awesome.
Coldstep Saga is an interesting one because I didn't play the demo for that but a friend of mine got me into that and was like this is the best game ever and nobody's ever heard of it and it's true.
I've never heard anything about that game but it's like freaking Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.
It was actually kind of awesome.
Kaijudo says demo made me buy Just Cause 2.
I love that game.
Hitstun goes so far as to make a little graph here.
My usual considerations when buying games.
Friends playing greater than reviews, greater than
Price greater than hype greater than demo.
So kind of putting demo towards the end of the chain there.
See, I honestly, because my friends have kind of different tastes all across the board.
So one person may like something, and I've turned out to completely hate it.
I mean, because it's just how it is.
I don't believe in making a judgment until I've played some of it, you know, or seen it played.
So demos and, you know, online videos of a game really...
Do more for me than relying on another person's opinion, if that makes sense.
Not that I disrespect my friends' opinions, but it's just, honestly, there's games that a lot of people love that I'm like, what the hell?
Like, I'll be perfectly honest, I'm kind of not all that into Skyrim.
Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
Alright, but then Technus kind of gives us our final thought on this story here.
I think not enough companies make demos for their games.
It is a lot of work though to turn out a demo, I mean...
but yeah, I think people discover games in many different ways, and a good demo is certainly one of them, but a bad demo can really damn your game, you know, one other thing I guess I want to open this, because I'm not so sure the article got into talking about this, but I think when it comes to the Xbox Live Arcade games or PlayStation Network games, those demos can really make or break the damn game I really do make my decisions based off those demos I play those demos a lot, I really do um
And I think those demos are really important.
Because especially when it's so easy, just press X to upgrade.
You know what I mean?
How easy is that if you really enjoy a demo?
Anyhow, we're going to now take a moment to dive into gaming history.
with the classic Game of the Week segment.
No demo needed here.
You play it because DarkSakura said so.
It's the classic Game of the Week.
Very interesting choice this week.
I hope that you picked the music from the first one on the list.
There was no list this week, DarkSakura, because of the website.
But I told you what the game was.
You did, so hopefully this is the right one.
We'll see.
Just play.
Okay, so the game of the week is called Three Wonders.
Or as it was in Japan, Wonder 3.
And it's an arcade game that was made by Capcom in 1991.
It's a PS1 game.
And you can choose three games in it.
You have Midnight Wanderer's Quest for the Chariot, which in Japan is called Roosters.
And it has a hobbit named Lou and Shiva in it.
Which I want to still say Shiva because that's how it would have been pronounced in the Japanese version.
Then there's Chariot Adventure Through the Sky, which is also just called Chariot in Japan, and then Don't Pull.
Midnight Wanderers is a platform game, and it's actually really, really cool.
I've watched Dan play it a number of times, and I've played it a little bit myself.
Pretty fun.
And then Chariot is a shmup where you have Lou and Shiva as well, and then Don't Pull is kind of like Pango.
It's a pulling puzzle-type game.
It came out in 1998 on the Sega Saturn and on the PlayStation.
And then Capcom re-released it in 2006 on the Capcom Classics Collection Vol.
2 on PS2 and Xbox and Capcom Classics Collection Remix for the PSP.
Really, there's not a whole bunch to say because they're...
Hey, hey, Dan!
Get in here and tell us about the game!
He said no.
He's a butthead.
But it really is very bright, vivid colors.
Very pretty.
It's a great game.
Lou also made it as an assist character for Marvel vs. Capcom.
And he basically looks exactly like he did in Midnight Wanderers.
And then he...
Uh, Shiva was actually, um, well, there was a character based on him for, uh, Cannon Spike.
It was called Shiba Shintaro, who was based off of him.
But, I mean, that's really it.
I mean, it's kind of a no-brainer.
Everyone should play this game.
But, really, everyone should just be playing the Midnight Wanderers part of the game.
So the classic game of the week is Three Wonders.
Or if you want, it's just Midnight Wonders, really.
Well, yeah.
But I mean, Shuri's not bad.
Shuri's not bad.
And I don't know, the puzzle game kind of pisses me off.
But then again, I suck at Pango.
I like Pango, so I would actually check out the puzzler.
That sounds like kind of cool.
Yeah.
And if anyone finds a Three Wonders machine, freaking take a picture of it for me.
Yeah, I've never even heard of this game.
I really haven't.
And it even runs on, like, Capcom hardware.
You'd think this thing would be everywhere, so.
Well, you can, I mean, you can run it on main, but easy.
Yeah, emulator, easy, but.
Yeah.
But it's really neat, but yeah.
I think just the star of the collection is Midnight Wonders.
All right, there you go.
Your classic game of the week, Three Wonders in the arcade.
Never on a console, right?
I just said it came out on consoles Sorry, I was trying to deal with another issue It came out in 1998 on the Saturn and Playstation Oh nice, okay And then we got re-releases in 2006 for the Playstation 2 and Xbox which was the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 Ah, that's right PSP is Capcom Classics Collection Remixed Alright Very, very awesome thing to have
Alright, well we're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere guys, we'll be right back with part B of our show, which might be a little bit shorter, but that just means more time for calls, and coming up tonight, a list list, and we'll tell you guys the topic when we come back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio for the second half of our show, live on November the 27th of 2011 at All Games Radio.
Yes, our website's busted right now.
If you try to visit it at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, you get a message that implies we haven't paid a bill, but trust me, if it was that easy to fix, we would have done it for the show.
Keep in mind our website is graciously donated, but you can't complain about free, so we just kind of have to wait for things to work themselves out behind the scenes.
So, anyhow, moving on, we are still trying to tape a show so that whenever our website does get back up, we can podcast it.
And we're having fun with our live listeners who are in our chat room.
You still can't get to our chat room even without chat.orangelingeradio.com, which you can do.
You can go to...
any IRC client look up Game Surge which is at irc.gamesurge.net and join Channel Orange Lounge you can also do that through the All Games chat client so if you just go over to chat.allgames.com if you really want something online just join Channel Orange Lounge from there it's really easy
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
so get your tweets in if you haven't already sent those in twitter.com slash OLR no rapid fire news tonight we're just going to get right into some longer news we'll start with oh I wanted to actually I did want to talk about this quickly we talked about like Black Friday stuff a little bit already and just kind of like some of the craziness that was going on out there
One of the stories that I had actually kind of grabbed Was about folks that were actually pepper sprayed in the face And slammed and all this stuff I think a lot of you guys heard about this I'm sure it was all over the news Some chick that was trying to get an Xbox Actually pepper sprayed people trying to get to it
So, you know, people are just getting crazy out there.
I have zero desire to participate in any of this type of Black Friday antics, but I noticed it.
I was leaving a Thanksgiving dinner in the Bay Area at about 1130, and I had to drive my friend that lives there, lives right by that Fry's in Fremont.
or maybe it's actually Milpitas at that point.
Yeah, Milpitas.
Yeah, so I had to literally drive right by that and yeah, parking lot was a madhouse and there was already a line at 1130, you know, and it just, I was like, I do not want to be anywhere near here and it's funny because you have Fry's on the left side of the road and then Walmart on the right side of the road and so like all the cars in the left turn lane were backed up and all the cars in the right turn lane were backed up.
The only clear lane was the middle.
you could zoom right down through the middle and get back on the freeway which is right there I for one would never be out in this kind of madness I didn't leave the house I don't blame you
Thanks for watching!
So, yeah, I am much more of a fan of Cyber Monday, which is coming up tomorrow.
And I guess some of the sales are out there already.
Wait till they figure out how to pepper spray you through the computer.
There's always that Tumblr.
You can see that pepper spray guy.
All it was pepper spray cop, pepper spraying cop, that Tumblr.
Also, I want to mention this.
Another great way to save money is through the sales online through services like Steam, who just had a pretty awesome sale, I got to say.
Portal 2 was $10 on Wednesday.
Civilization 5 was $10 yesterday.
They've been having some really good sales.
I don't know if you guys have picked anything up.
I actually didn't...
I got to admit, a lot of the games that were on sale that I would have bought, I already bought at full price earlier.
So I didn't really indulge in the sale, except I did buy some DLC.
I bought some Civ V DLC that I hadn't picked up before during the sale.
Did you guys purchase anything through these sales?
Nope.
No?
No?
No?
What about you guys in our chatroom at chat.northwestradio.com?
You know, I tried to poll the people on our Google+, our new Google Plus page, and I kind of got a very similar response.
It's like, nah, didn't want to be out fighting in it.
I had a better time just kind of pointing and laughing at people.
I've learned my lesson from going to some Black Friday stuff.
Not necessarily lining up at midnight or something, but just going there during the day.
and I remember the last time I actually went out well there was two times there was one where I went out because I actually needed some DVD-Rs and so I went to Best Buy it wasn't actually that bad it was just like normal Saturday traffic I think as long as you're not there like an hour or two before or after opening it's fine
Yeah, so that was that.
And then I went to Fry's one time because I was looking for something.
I don't remember exactly what now, but Fry's was terrible.
And it was like in the afternoon on Black Friday and the line was just like an hour and a half long for whatever.
and I mean that's bad when they have like 30 registers open or something but and that line is still that long it was really bad and they had a guy walking around the balloon that a giant like weather balloon says line ends here and he's basically this line just snakes through the entire store
It's ridiculous.
Crazy.
But yeah, I don't really like doing that stuff.
And even the recent games I've got, I actually have Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 that I got for free and Skyrim I got for free because every now and then the publisher likes to actually send us stuff.
So I played that, but I'm not going to buy any new stuff.
In fact, actually...
Probably not going to buy any new games for a long time.
I don't really know what the next new game I'd probably get.
Borderlands 2, but that's about it.
I've got to buy Mario Kart.
I still have a credit on Amazon, though.
I'm seriously thinking of trading in Modern Warfare 3 for...
I'd probably lean more towards Super Mario Land 3D than I would Mario Kart because Mario Kart's kind of it's the same stuff all over again they're like repeating old classic tracks instead of coming up with original stuff and then adding the classic tracks
We got a couple comments in our chat rooms.
Evil, or E3VL, which I think he is evil, is in our chat saying, is the Cyber Monday sale separate from the Autumn sale on Steam?
You know, I'm not sure if Steam's going to do something separate on Monday.
I wouldn't anticipate it.
Well, there's also, remember, the Amazon Gold Box sales, which are always really good.
Cyber Monday is actually an internet-wide thing.
It's kind of the internet's response to Black Friday because Monday is when everybody goes back to work.
And I guess there's this perception that nobody actually works when they go back to work.
Instead, they're online shopping all day.
It's pretty accurate sometimes.
All these companies do these big online sales on Monday.
Yeah.
It's totally a man-made, invented thing, but hey, any excuse for a sale, right?
So Steam may get in on it.
I know Microsoft is supposed to be doing something.
They've been doing some sales on Xbox Live all week.
You can get things like Bejeweled 3.
God, some game was only like 240.
Oh, I think it's Bejeweled Blitz or something.
It's only like 240 Microsoft points, which is about what it's worth.
JVMod in our chatroom is talking about some of the Black Friday sales he got I got the $200 Playstation 3 bundle the $179.99 3DS bundle the $199.99 42 inch TV and a 3004 laptop I don't know what a 3004 laptop is I think he mistyped something the rest of that sounds like you dude can I have a loan?
Probably $300 for a laptop.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe that's what it is.
$300 for a laptop.
Oh, $300.
Maybe shift F4.
So that's nice, though.
That's like your whole electronics for several years taken care of in one day.
It's pretty nice.
And Technus says, Oh, and after working a Black Friday myself, I cannot support it.
You know, I gotta say, props to you folks in retail, especially those of you on the front lines.
I mean, yeah, people pepper spraying in Walmart and shit is madness, but can you imagine having to work that Walmart that night?
Oh my God.
You poor people.
There's a very big reason why I never want to do retail again.
It's all summed up in one day right there.
All right, let's move on with some gaming news, Loki.
Well, just because you've done, what, ten of them in a row?
Dan called us all blisses.
Uh, yeah.
I got a funny story, actually, about this story that I'm going to talk about.
First off, let's talk about this.
Ridge Racer Vita.
We were talking about why people pirate stuff.
This is pretty bad.
Ridge Racer Vita, it only includes three courses and five cars.
It sounds almost like a demo to me.
Apparently, according to the Japanese press sampling of Ridge Racer, they're surprised to find that the game only has a few tracks and a few cars.
They said, of course, there will be download content, but it's just weird that there's so little material.
Also, apparently, I guess there's also supposed to be this Planetary League as well, which is a new mode that sounds kind of neat.
and Planetary League.
I guess Namco is going to be sending out team battle missions for multiplayer.
Plus it's also playable over Wi-Fi and ad hoc and all sorts of stuff and you can share ghost data.
But three tracks and five cars?
Really?
And on top of that... Because you know it's going to be DLC.
And on top of that, the game is supposed to be slightly cheaper than...
you know, most of the video games.
40 bucks instead of 50.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Boo hiss.
If this is true, if this is true, then fuck this game for real.
And it only runs at 30 frames per second instead of 60 frames per second.
And here's, I had a dream last night about this.
I seriously, for some reason, and I don't even know why because I read this earlier in the week, some reason I just had a dream about this.
And I remember I was talking to some guy
who apparently in the dream was representative of the person responsible for this game and my response was this what the fuck were you thinking I mean really seriously three fucking tracks and five cars no one's gonna fucking buy this game
It's Ridge Racer
That's all you get for this.
I mean, three fucking tracks.
Here's the thing.
It's one thing to just openly reject this game if it does come out $40.
I hope this is just like maybe an early build, like a press build or something, like a demo.
Maybe just they're really working to get the full game done and it's just not ready, you know, and it's not going to be ready until it goes gold.
I'm really hoping that's what happens.
And soon we'll get this Japanese website that's like, comes with 20 tracks and 20...
Oh, I hope so, because Ridge Racer is pretty awesome.
I think for the launch, the 3DS, it was one of the best games that they had available.
It was, yeah.
Even though there was all rehash stuff.
But the 3D effects, it was a good 3D show-off game, yeah.
But, I mean, seriously.
I like Dungeon Buster in our chat room.
Ridge Ripoff!
It is just...
and it's funny though because I actually I watched I was reading you know this and then I watched like the trailer I'm like hey you know what that trailer only shows these three tracks I wonder but it's gonna be one thing if the game comes out like this but it's gonna be just flat-out insulting if they add like a bunch of tracks as download content unless it's all free it's free DLC they won't but why would they do that they won't no
Now, here's where I would support it.
Remember on the PSP, they had Rock Band.
You could buy Rock Band in the game.
Then they also had Rock Band where you could download the free demo and then you pay for songs.
Oh, yeah, I remember that.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine with that.
If they want to do this, like, say, put it on the store and, like, you know, okay, well, you can buy the game for nothing.
It comes with three tracks and five cars, and you can buy the rest of the game for DLC.
Okay.
I'm fine with that or you know you pay 99 cents and you get the rest of this later on but as a retail game for like I'm assuming this is going to be 40 bucks I have yet to see the setup information for this I can't confirm on the price yet hopefully I'll know that soon but this is good it's probably gonna be about $40 game
Well Namco, one thing you need to do when you get back to work this week after the holiday is you need to clarify.
Well I guess maybe in Japan they didn't really have the same holiday but still come next week at work they need to clarify what the hell is going on here?
What is this game actually going to have in it?
So hopefully next week we can correct that.
Anyhow, let's move on.
A story has hit ComputerAndVideoGames.com about two possible, as they're calling it, Xbox 720 models that are planned.
Apparently, there's going to be a dual SKU strategy expected, along with a significant Kinect upgrade.
Long story short, you may or may not remember this.
Remember the Xbox 360 had two ways you could buy it.
They had the, what, the regular, or what was it called, the
Core and the Premium
and it came with, thank you, a wireless controller instead of a wired one.
That was the other big difference.
And I think a shiny silver door as opposed to a plain white one.
Whoop-de-doo, right?
So apparently that's the road they're going down for whatever this next Xbox is, is that one will be a...
Pairdown system to be released as cheaply as possible positioned more along the lines of a set-top box because 360 as a Netflix viewing device is apparently a huge deal and perhaps a Kinect-themed gaming portal but then there will be a more fully-featured machine with an optical drive hard disk and backward compatibility aimed at the hardcore would be released at a higher price point listen to that again
There's going to be a... Maybe, if rumors are to be believed, and there's going to be rumors or anything at this point, but maybe there's going to be an Xbox with no drive.
Dude, I don't buy that there's not going to be drive in there.
Optical drives are so fucking cheap.
It's just... Why would you do that?
I mean, because basically you're forcing people to buy the product online.
I mean, that's really the way they want to go with it, and fine.
But really, no optical drive?
I mean...
DVD drives?
Okay, let's assume that it's going to be a Blu-ray drive.
Blu-ray drives are not incredibly expensive anymore.
I mean, they're not as cheap as DVD drives, that's for sure.
You can get a Blu-ray player now for, what, $80, $100?
I can't imagine that those drives are that expensive.
Those things used to be $400 or $500.
Of course, same thing could be said about DVD players.
I remember a time when a DVD player was like, that's the thing the rich kids had.
I mean, hey, whatever.
That's fine.
They're giving you options.
So you don't have to buy the cheap, cheap, cheap one if you really want to.
So obviously a lot of this is still to be unveiled.
Another rumor is that Kinect will likely get a significant upgrade and be bundled with the console.
That all makes sense.
I mean, I think Kinect is something Microsoft's kind of embedded in their...
It'll get better.
It'll be interesting.
Yeah, the technology will get better, that's for sure.
But then here's the other thing.
Can I tell you the thing that bothers me most about this story?
As that it's called two Xbox 720 models reportedly planned.
Okay, seriously?
We need to stop calling it the Xbox 720 because that is a stupid name.
It's not going to be called the Xbox 720.
Why would you call it that?
The Xbox 360 did not come after the Xbox 359, okay?
It's not, you know, and I get it, 360 times 2 is 720, but you know what?
Something tells me they're going to just go another direction with the name.
As to what direction they're going to go with the name?
Well, we thought we would bring back one of our old friends to help us figure that out, what exactly that name could be.
And that is a segment on the show we like to call ListList!
That's right, tonight's listless topic is what should we refer to the new Xbox as?
What should the new Xbox be called?
What should we refer to it as here on the program?
Because we're not calling it the Xbox 720 anymore.
So what should the new name for the Xbox be?
2, or whatever it's going to be, or I guess it would really be Xbox 3, what should it be called?
So, if you want to give us suggestions, you can in our chatroom at chat.orange.com, but this is a highly scientific process, people.
Here's the way the list works if you've never listened to Listless before on the show.
We're each going to go around and give our top three answers.
That'll come up with a list of nine, since we have no guests tonight.
Usually it's a list of 12, not tonight.
But then we're each going to go around and take one off the list.
Oh, that's the hard part.
That'll leave a list of six, which you guys will go around and vote on your number one and number two answers for.
And we're going to get a definitive answer for what should the new Xbox be called.
All right.
So chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to give our suggestions.
Excuse me.
I forgot that.
It doesn't work tonight.
Channel Orange Lounge on IRC Game Search if you want to give your suggestions.
Let's start building the list.
So we will start with Loki tonight.
Your number three answer, what should they call the new Xbox?
Or what should we refer to it as here on the show?
Well, the way they have been changing their naming schemes for things, like especially Windows operating systems and stuff, before it used to be Windows 95, Vista, and they'd have funky names.
Now it's Windows 7, and they're talking about Windows 8.
So I'm just going to say Microsoft Xbox 3.
When I close my eyes...
Because it's simplified, I know it makes no sense, 363, but whatever.
So you're just going to call it the Xbox 3?
Xbox 3.
Why not?
It works for PlayStation.
Why not?
Alright.
Let's go to DarkSakura, your number 3 answer for what should the new Xbox be referred to as here on the program.
Xbox 420.
Xbox 420.
I wonder what this system does.
Oh man, suddenly I want to eat some Cheetos.
What do you want to play?
Why is Cheech and Chong suddenly the spokespeople for this system?
Or I guess now it's Harold and Kumar, I guess.
The new Muppets movie was so fucking awesome.
DarkSakura.com
I'm just saying, the new Muppets movie is really fucking good.
It's a little bit hokey because it's a kid's movie, but it's great.
Well, when someone buys my ticket, I'll go see it.
What cameo?
Line for what?
Okay, he's now the announcer for California Screamin'.
So he does the safety announcement kind of like a fair barker.
and then when you're in... Sorry, Rob.
Sorry, it's a name suggested in chat.
You in the chat can't influence the list because I just saw a name in there I am fucking taking for the list.
So when you're actually in the thing ready to go, it says, Second thoughts?
Too late!
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, boom!
Nice.
So it makes it all the way better.
Alright, back to the list.
So far we have Microsoft Xbox 3 and Xbox 420.
Now, I have to explain this name a little bit.
My name is the DexBox.
The Dex Box.
Because Dex is short for what in Dungeons & Dragons speak?
Dexterity.
That's something that thieves have a high amount of.
So it's the Dex Box.
And so be it, Microsoft.
Dex Box steal from you.
You know what?
I always played Rangers.
The Microsoft Dex Box is my answer.
Let's go to Loki for your number two answer.
I'm trying to think of really stupid Microsoft names.
Let's see.
The Microsoft Windows 8 Entertainment System.
Yes, it's very generic and stupid, but you know what?
It's something that sounds like it could be a Microsoft product.
The Windows 8 Entertainment System.
So we'd call it the latest?
Waiters!
There's a fly in my soup, waiters!
Only if Harvey Fierstein can be the spokesperson for the waiters.
I've got to call my mother and tell her to get a waiters.
You could have been a doctor, but instead you're a waiters.
I don't know why.
When I hear the name waiters, I think about Hire Me Fierce Team, but it just works, doesn't it?
I could have retired in a bloke.
The waiters, it has high definition connect.
That's awesome.
It can see how big your wiener is.
It's the weightest.
And I'll tell you, eight isn't enough.
Okay.
Moving on.
DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?
ZuneBox.
I almost said your number eight pick.
Your number two pick, ZuneBox.
ZuneBox.
Oh, ZuneBox.
X, U, N, E, V, O, X You want to spell it with an X instead of a Z?
Oh, okay.
No, I like it.
It's like Shusha.
Or you can spell it with a Z, that's fine.
Yeah, spell it with a Z, because that's what the thing is.
I don't know, I was just in the X thing.
Okay, Zunebox, even though I think Microsoft retired the Zune some time ago.
They have the whole Zune thing.
Okay, Zunebox, I can see that.
Maybe the Zune could be saved.
Cause it's cooler to have it Zoom bar Oh sorry, no dash Yeah that's how I would brand it If they would hire me
Damn it, Microsoft.
You should hire me to be your designer because I'm amazing and I make all your stuff look like Apple stuff.
All right.
Let's move on.
My number two answer.
I'm going to just put this.
This is the rumored name and I do like this as a name for the system.
And just in case this really is the name, I would like to be able to say we were right and we called it on the list.
So I'm going to put Xbox Loop on the list because Loop is the rumored name or at least the working title.
That's a stupid name.
Well, it makes sense, though.
360 and then Loop.
I don't know.
Xbox Loop.
It makes me think back to the books I was reading.
Spiral, Loop, and then... Alright.
So that means that some crazy-ass dead girl is going to climb out of my Xbox Loop when I don't change a disc for seven days.
And that's how they'll market it, is that, you know, in seven days, this machine will kill you.
All right.
Number one answer time.
Loki, number one for the list.
Let's see.
I'm going to do... Let's see.
The Microsoft... The Microsoft teabag rage quit...
Racial Slur The Microsoft Teabag Rage Quit Racial Slur, wherever did that name come from?
They named it after the players.
We took your feedback and we've incorporated it into the name of our new machine.
We have an algorithm running that monitors all sorts of voice communication over the system.
And it's generated the perfect name for our system based off of the language that is used the most.
It's the Microsoft T-Bag Racial Slur.
or the MTRs.
Okay.
DarkSakura, your number one answer.
It's completely stupid.
It's X-Rombus.
Because I would really like to see them make something in the shape of a rhomboid.
All right.
All diagonal and shit.
Okay, I'm going to say for my number one answer, okay, originally I was going to do the Xbox Penetrator, which I still like as a name, but I got to say I was won over by something that was suggested in chat because somebody brought up an old ass OLR joke that's seriously like seven years old at this point.
So I give props to, I think it was SSJ100 Matt that said it.
Yeah, it was SSJ100Matt that said it.
I'm gonna go with his answer for my number one.
The Xbox non-Cylon-occupied Caprica.
Because this robot's for the good guys, we promise.
As these devices in our living room become more self-aware.
The Xbox non-Cylon-occupied Caprica.
Alright.
This is a really shitty list.
It is.
This is one of our worst.
Alright, at least we got Harvey Fierstein.
Alright, so we have the Microsoft Xbox 3, the Xbox 420, the DexBox...
The Waiters, the Windows 8 Entertainment System, the ZuneBox, the Xbox Loop, the Microsoft Teabag Rage Quit Racial Slur, the X-Rombus, and the Xbox Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.
I think what I'm going to do, just because we don't have a fourth person with us tonight doing this with us, I'm going to go with one I'm seeing in chat a lot and just add it to the list.
I'm going to go with the Xbox Lube, which I'm seeing in the chat several times.
And I think that's off a mispronunciation I made.
Let's call Dan in to pick one, too.
A couple weeks ago on the show, I think I said I was talking about the Lube, and I think I accidentally said the Xbox Lube or something like that.
And so everybody's like, let's call it that.
So fine.
You're ready.
Time to open up some room in your entertainment system.
Dan's voting for waiters.
Alright.
Forget it.
We gotta go to the next phase.
Alright, we added one based on chats.
We added Xbox Lube.
So now we have a list of ten.
We're gonna take this down to a list of seven.
Sadly, it's time to start eliminating things from the list.
Loki, oh wait, let me read you the list so far.
Oh wait, I already did.
Sorry, I'm just excited.
Do you need more soda?
The Xbox Lube gets me excited.
What's wrong, Rob?
Waiters!
I need more sugar!
You're my sugar!
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
DexFox.
You didn't like my dexterity joke?
It's stretching it.
Oh!
It's stretching it!
Yet another catchphrase for the Xbox lube.
Stretching the bounds of your imagination Can you take this all in?
Alright We have to take it slow DarkSakura Just try to relax DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
It's nothing against you, Rob, but I'm taking off Xbox Loop because I think it's... I hope that's not the official name and I wouldn't want it to be associated with the official name.
Alright, so the Xbox Loop comes off the list.
Dang, you guys eliminated almost my whole list.
Alright, well I'm not taking my own answer off.
I've got to leave at least one up there.
So the one I'm going to take off, I'm going to take off Microsoft Xbox 3.
It's just stupid.
Yeah, the PlayStation does that.
Come on.
I am making the chatters be more creative tonight than pick that answer.
All right.
So here it is.
This is the official list that you can vote on.
I wonder what's going to win.
Your number one and number two answers are welcome through private message to Sky in the chat room right now.
Here it is.
Xbox 420, Windows 8 Entertainment System, Queda's ZuneBox, Microsoft Teabag Rage Quit Racial Slur, X-Rombus, Xbox Non-Sylon Occupied Caprica, and the Xbox Lube.
Send a private message to Sky with your votes for number one and number two answers.
If you don't say which is one and which is two, then I assume your first one is one and your second one is two.
And of course, now everybody is coming up.
Everybody's a comic now.
Actdeft in our chat room.
Xbox Lube, get ready to stretch.
Hecht, Xbox Lube, we're stretching it.
Dungeon Buster gives new meaning to the term Red Ring of Death.
Oh, we're so mature.
All right.
I'm glad you guys decided on some highbrow entertainment for your day.
All right.
Sadly, there's no mailbag tonight.
Sadly.
But there's always time for some FUs of the week.
FU to Stuff and Things and the Stuff and Things are actually Stuff and Things that I'm not at liberty to openly discuss and then FU to I'm going to get political here
F you to people who vote a straight party ticket and F you to people in high positions who think they can cheat and get away with it because they have cheated and gotten away with it.
People wonder why everyone's so pissed.
Done.
Fuck you to the local news stations for counting down to Black Friday.
It was so annoying.
It's 11 o'clock and there are people lined up.
Yes, people line up every single year.
It's not fucking news.
Don't be amazed that people are lined up for sales.
They do it all the damn time.
F you to the fact that my vacation from work is almost over I mean I like my job and all but I really like sitting at home on my ass doing nothing and then F you to the fact that I'm like really getting hungry but I have a lovely dinner that Alan's been working on literally all day in the crock pot waiting for me when I get home so I have that to look forward to but in the meantime god damn I want a donut F you to donuts for being delicious
Fuck you to Krispy Kreme not being in Northern California.
I get Krispy Kreme in two months.
F you to Krispy Kreme not being next door.
I get Krispy Kreme in two months.
Did you work that all out?
Huh?
Well, that's still the goal time.
Gotcha.
All right.
Well, let's go back to some gaming news.
And then the Skype line is coming up real soon.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
But not yet because we still have a few more stories to get through starting with Loki.
Yes, we were talking about new Xbox systems, and, well, this is something that is kind of branching out the Kinect a little bit.
Kinect for Windows.
It's going to be using a new Kinect camera, because before I was like, well, you've got to sit eight feet away from your damn computer to use this thing.
But, no, they're actually going to include a firmware that's going to support a new near mode that's designed to see objects as close as 50 centimeters away from the camera.
and I guess also they're launching with this in early 2012 a Kinect Accelerator program which will give $20,000 each to 10 startups using Kinect along with Microsoft development tools.
Marketing Visibility, and Mentoring.
So it'll be interesting to see what they use Kinect for the PC.
And obviously maybe we'll see this integrated into laptops and stuff like that.
So it might be interesting to see how this evolves.
One other thing I was going to mention, too, is kind of a story that we got left out.
There's a rumor that Microsoft is in the early stages of licensing with Sony for a Kinect-enabled TV.
Oh, yeah, I had heard about that.
Obviously, it's supposed to be, I would imagine, some sort of like...
I don't know, maybe some sort of web-enabled TV.
You know how they have the enhanced TVs now where you can browse content online, maybe different apps.
Maybe that's how you'll browse through movies, doing Netflix and that kind of stuff through a TV.
Be interesting to see that.
That actually happened.
It would also be weird to see Sony partnering with Microsoft on something.
I would think it's somewhat inevitable that the next Xbox whatever we're going to end up calling it which we'll find out here in a minute could have Blu-ray in it.
I would think they'd go with a proprietary disc but maybe if it's really supposed to be the whole Netflix I would think Blu-ray because they're going to try to get in on that.
So they're going to have to kind of partner with Sony for that anyway.
So it could be interesting.
It could be very interesting.
Anyway, you give us Blu-ray and we'll give you Kinect.
Are you interested in Kinect for Windows at all, Loki?
No, because I work on my laptop mostly.
So, I mean, hell, I don't use Kinect anyways on my 360.
Did you see that super fuzzy-wuzzy feel-good commercial that Extifer had posted on his Facebook where he's like, I really like the music in this.
I've seen that before.
It's basically an Apple commercial, but with Kinect.
I've seen that before, and it's a neat concept that they're showing these classrooms enabled with all these big projection screens and doing stuff.
It's just like the Cisco commercials that they have where there's kids in the U.S.
talking to kids in China through almost like a portal or whatever.
um you know like a some sort of webcam projection setup or whatever that they got but I mean I don't know it's a neat idea that they'll eventually do this stuff but and definitely with Connect for Windows and people creating new applications for it I could see more of that stuff coming about but it's I don't know it's too ideal for me idealistic I guess would be the word
Alright, I'm going to move on with another story here.
This is also the very, very, very, very, very last call for Cagematch.
Listless votes, because we're about done.
There's an interesting petition going on out there, and this is not... Okay, there's like two things going on right now.
There's a really funny thing going around Facebook, which is from like a parody site, which is about how Xbox is...
and all this stuff.
Skyrim is turning everybody gay and all this stuff.
You mean Skyrim job?
Exactly, something like that.
That was a really funny parody article.
It was on Christwire or something like that.
It's like an onion site for religious sites.
But anyway, what I really want to share is this is actually a serious thing.
This is a White House petition.
Because you know the WhiteHouse.gov website will let you do your own petition.
And somebody actually started one on there urging...
to ban the Elder Scrolls Skyrim for the safety of America's youths.
There were five backers that signed the petition at the time this was posted around gaming blogs.
Of course, tons more people have signed it as a joke or whatever after that.
But yeah, it's basically petitioning the Obama administration.
Let me read this.
Quote, No, it's not.
where sexual perversion and homosexuality are threatening to destroy the Christian foundations on which this nation was built.
Did you hear that?
My relationship is threatening America.
You know what?
Do you feel threatened by my relationship?
Girl, no.
Well, you should be threatened because he knows how to cook.
Anyhow.
I'm totally not threatened because I want to come over for dinner.
Whereas a new video game has just been created that far exceeds any others in the psychological and spiritual damage it does to teens.
We ask you to ban Skyrim, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
I guess this petition may have actually been created by that same parody website.
But whatever, it's still interesting that you can post this out there and that it is on the official White House site.
And I bet you people signed that not knowing that it was parody.
I bet a lot of people signed it not knowing if it really was parody.
But they didn't really know that.
That's just sad.
Yeah.
So I want to create a petition banning online petitions.
How's that sound?
Cool.
If you want to petition for something, you go stand outside of a Walmart and get signatures.
I'd be like, hey, well, you know they did that on an episode of Bullshit.
Did they?
About, um...
Missguided patriotism and how people, if they hear certain keywords, will sign just about anything.
Protect children.
Yeah, but they actually did show that it was actually the majority of people who I think wouldn't actually sign it because they stopped to think about it.
But then again, they also had a petition out at a Greenpeace rally to ban H2O.
Oh, yeah, I think I remember something like that.
Like, it was, like, banned.
But, like, this chemical is in... And it was a chemical name, and it was, like, water.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or soda or something like that, yeah.
No, it was water.
Was it?
But they were like, it's a dangerous chemical, and blah, blah, blah, blah, and, you know.
Gotcha.
Interesting.
All right, one more story from you, DarkSakura, and then it's almost time for the tweets at Twitter.
Like, dihydrogenoxide.
At twitter.com slash OLR.
Dihydrogen dioxide.
All right.
Yeah.
I'm being dumb.
Okay.
So I have another article.
Google Chrome.
Yay, Google Chrome.
Well, it's actually going to be adding in more hardware support to the browser, including using a gamepad.
So not only will you be able to play your games, you can play your games with your actual gamepad.
And that means it's going to be a lot more of these...
Web-only games should actually start being easier to play.
I mean, we might see a bit more development for new true console-style games.
I mean, we've already got a lot of NES games emulated in Flash.
We might see more.
I like the idea of gamepads in browsers, but that's just going to lead to even more of the emulation websites.
There's a little bit more.
Google's actually going to put in support for WebRTC, which is a video chat thing, but Firefox already has gamepad support for the record.
Can I actually say that I do really like, though, that, you know, we had a story last week or the week before or whenever we had a show about how, like, you can get demos for games through YouTube now.
Like, there was that FIFA game.
Like, so it would make a lot of sense that gamepads will be enabled within the browser because, like, a lot of stuff seems like it's going to be streaming, like, right through your browser.
And shit, people play the Facebook games and probably a Google Plus game is looking at using this if Google Chrome is launching it.
So...
It's interesting.
But yeah, that kind of support, I can support.
Ha!
Alright, let's see.
We're about to get to the Twitter and last minute stories, but I think we should do some listless results.
Shouldn't we find out what we're going to be calling the new Xbox officially?
Well, yeah.
Because you know, after tonight, it's no more Xbox 720.
We will be calling it by this name.
The bend over and take it like a man.
Let's find out.
Let's see if... Let's see who got their way.
In at number three is a tie.
Uh-oh.
The number three answer for what we should call the new system, the Xbox 420, because, you know, we have a few stoners in our chat, and the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.
Yeah.
You're tied for your number three answer.
The number two thing you most want to call the new Xbox is the Xbox non-Cylon-occupied Caprica.
Yay!
And the number one answer.
Can I put it this way?
It got twice as many votes.
And no one's surprised.
The number one answer, the Xbox Lube, is the official name of the new Xbox console.
Congratulations, chatterers.
Congratulations, Microsoft and the Xbox Lube.
Do you think you can handle it?
I think it should be bend over and take it like a man.
They're very narrowly missing the list, by the way.
Waiters didn't make the top three.
Did you notice that?
That's poopy.
Even after my Harvey Fierstein impersonation, waiters missed the list.
I think that might have hurt it.
That might have hurt.
You're right.
It might have hurt its chances.
They were raised badly.
Them others didn't do their job.
Alright, so there it is.
The Xbox Lube is the official new title of the Xbox console and here on the show, here in chat, and hopefully soon across the entirety of the internet.
Can we call it the Xbloob?
Sure, we can call it the Xbloob and other fun creations there will be Xbox Lube.
Alright, let's get to last minute stories.
I don't know, again, we were in an interesting situation this week because we lost the usual way we prep the show.
So does anybody have anything they want to add?
DarkSakura, were there any stories that you wanted to get to that we didn't
No, not really.
Well, actually, hold on, there was one.
Loki, do one.
Okay, Loki, do one.
Hopefully it's not the same story or you're screwed.
South Korea has put into effect what they're calling the Cinderella Law.
Basically, they're working with their internet providers that they're going to block players from under 16 from playing between midnight and 6 a.m.
on online services such as PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.
What?
It is in Korea.
Well, didn't they ban MMOs too?
Yes.
Was that South or North that did that?
South Korea.
Okay.
Okay, I've got a couple.
One of them is that Microsoft bought a video surf to use on Xbox Live.
What's VideoSurf do?
It's a search engine, but it's saying that the overtime technology, it says it's supposed to be integrated with Xbox Live, and that you can use it to search for TV, film, across several Xbox Live applications.
Love Film, Zune, etc.,
the US will okay in the UK they're getting BBC content and the US will get Bravo, Comcast, HBO Go, Verizon, FIOS and Syfy we're gonna get Bravo yeah I know I was like I can't wait for the real housewives of you know Boulder Colorado or wherever they're gonna go next
And then, um, I, you probably said something about this on, um, Horde House Yes, I did, but go ahead Yeah, about the, uh, talent calculator being live for Mists of Pandaria Or as I call it, MOP Which is notable because the game itself shouldn't be out for at least another six months, if not more like nine to twelve So it's interesting that the talent calculator's already out there
So you can see how talented you want to be at mopping.
There you go.
Loki?
Oh, the calculator for monk is not available.
Right, because they don't want to give everything away.
Yeah.
A few things.
There was supposed to be a lawsuit against EA for reneging on the fact that Battlefield 1943 didn't come with Battlefield 3 or something like that.
So now they're going to be giving away The other way around, by the way.
They're going to be giving away Battlefield 1943 vouchers to everybody that bought the PlayStation 3 version of Battlefield 3.
To redeem this, you have to go to their portal, which is 1943redemption.battlefield.com
DarkSakura.com
So that's good that they finally came through with that.
Unfortunately, it took a lot to do that.
I'm not sure if we reported on this before, but the same thing happened with Saints Row the 3rd.
They were supposed to be getting exclusive content for Saints Row the 3rd, and THQ came now.
If you...
Sign up if you log in your online pass that comes with the new copies of Saints Row 3, or if you buy the game and buy the online pass, if you buy the game used and buy the online pass, as long as you redeem that pass, I forget what the time frame is, you get a free copy or a free download of Saints Row 2 on the PlayStation 3, which is pretty awesome.
Yeah, I heard about that.
Definitely worth checking that out.
Cthulhu Saves the World Bundle has sold 100,000 copies on Steam.
How many did they sell on Xbox Live Arcade or indie games?
Indie games, they have only moved 55,000 to date.
And that's been available since December 2010.
Sadly, that's still more than I would have thought.
and uh actually wait a second here I'm sorry uh Breath of Death that was Breath of Death 7 has been uh available since April 2010 on Xbox Live Indie Games and has moved 55,000 copies uh to date Cthulhu uh Saves the World has been available since December 2010 and has only generated uh 20,000 downloads yikes
And apparently, I don't know when it went up on Steam, but they sold 100,000 copies.
Oh, since July.
July.
So, yeah.
Big difference there.
Apparently, their next title that they're working on is actually was the once-canceled Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness, Episode 3.
Oh, interesting.
So these guys picked it up.
Yeah.
Huh.
um so it's interesting um also uh what's also interesting Elder Scrolls Skyrim has uh much of the uh I guess uh land of uh Tamriel from uh was it uh yeah there was a video of that up of the guy uh no clipping right yeah from Morrowind um and people are assuming that's just from uh cause the way they display the map or whatever that they just wanted to be complete um
It's still neat either way.
And of course, Skyrim got a patch on PC, but what's kind of annoying is that they added mandatory Steam DRM.
And they've also killed some of the tweaks that you can do in the game.
So, that kind of sucks.
and then last but not least, new dashboard update for the Xbox 360 has been dated for December 6th.
Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of big news we missed, huh?
And that of course will be bringing cloud storage as well as the beacon support which is I believe live already on Xbox.com Isn't that kind of like the don't you want to play these games with me type of thing?
Yeah, like you go, hey, I'm playing Call of Duty later today.
And so you can see that.
That's kind of cool, I guess.
Something.
So they have that.
And also, of course, the redesign to make it look like Windows Phone 7.
Boo.
Let's open up the Skype line.
We're ready to take your calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number.
Or you can look us up on Skype.
Username is Orange Lounge Radio.
All one word.
877 number is free in the US and Canada, toll free.
Can't say the same everywhere else.
So definitely use Skype if you're somewhere else.
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, all one word.
Meanwhile, we have just a couple of tweets for you.
We didn't get a whole lot tonight, but just a couple.
We'll start here with a link from Tiger Claw on Twitter sent us.
A reminder, I did read about this earlier.
I didn't make the show roll tonight, but he reminds us just in time for Christmas, the Batcave will be Arkham City's newest challenge map.
So there is going to be some DLC that hits, and I think the date was December 20th.
Yeah, December 20th is going to be a new DLC pack.
Of course, this is for Arkham City, and it's actually going to be a Batcave challenge map.
It's also going to contain the Iceberg Lounge and Joker's Carnival.
So yeah, that's going to be coming out December 20th.
Didn't the Robin pack hit this week?
Yeah.
I've got to check that out.
Because, yeah, I don't know much about what's supposed to be in that Robin pack, except, well, of course, Robin.
You can play as Robin.
I wonder if they integrate him into the story like they do Catwoman.
I think he's supposed to be integrated into the story.
That's kind of rad.
I might have to check that out.
Yeah.
All right, again, the phone is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or as your name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We are getting a call, so let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
It's Jester Scott.
Jester Scott, welcome to the show.
Hi.
Hi.
What's on your mind, buddy?
I have a couple of things.
I think that y'all were talking about the
GameStop stickers one time.
How they've gotten a little bit better from being so sticky.
And, um... Well, I bought Zelda.
I think you were saying something about this, Loki.
You used to be able to very carefully take those things off and you could put it back on.
I think we had a guest or somebody was saying something about that.
No, that wasn't me.
All right.
Right, well, normally the new stickers can come off very easily now I'm still leaving that sticky residue, right?
Well, I go to take off my sticker on the Zelda copy that I got Well, the front of it's foil Guess what came off?
The Foil
Well, you know what that means.
They were on to our schemes.
They started reading the internet and they knew that people were just opening them and then trying to return them like they were new.
But you know what?
They deserve it for that crappy policy anyway.
But whatever.
I don't even know why I'm trying to sell it like new.
You had actually pre-ordered Zelda and you still got a copy like that?
It wasn't in the shrink wrap?
Oh, no, no, no.
It was sealed and everything.
It just still had that big-ass sticker on the front of the box.
Oh, and so now when you took it off, now your box has it, and you won't be able to sell it on eBay or anything, huh?
No.
Well, I wasn't going to sell it anyway.
It's just an eye sore.
So they had a sticker underneath the shrink wrap?
No, no, no.
The box to Zelda...
It was kind of like the 25th anniversary for Mario, only the whole box didn't have a flap.
I getcha.
Yeah, the front of that foil and the big old sticker they had on it took off.
Well, let me go this direction because you've actually played the new Zelda then, which is something, despite all the other games that are out right now, we haven't had a chance to play.
How do you like the new Zelda game?
Oh my god.
I think it's amazing.
Yeah?
Yes, the controls are a little finicky.
You have to get used to it because it fully uses the Wii Motion Plus or motion controls, whatever it is.
Um...
It goes in a different direction.
Yes, the graphics are a little toned down, but the game is very, very long.
I've got 30 hours into it and either I really suck or this game is extremely long.
How is it different from Twilight Princess, would you say?
Well, I didn't play very much of Twilight Princess.
I know, gamer Shane.
But I don't know.
It's just like
Any move you make with your Wiimote link on the screen will make that movement.
It's kind of funny because if you're sitting down playing Zelda, he kind of holds his sword out.
He looks retarded on the screen.
He's just running around with his sword straight up in the air or straight in front of him.
But it will just
It'll mimic the movement of your hand, literally.
So it sounds like the Wii Motion Plus really added a lot more than maybe sometimes we give it credit for.
The extra technology really kind of added a lot to it.
Yeah, and I've been reading a little bit of hate of that online.
You know, like, oh, well, but it's Zelda.
Why can't they just do it for a controller?
Well, if you think about it, with every Zelda game, well, nearly every Zelda game, they've done something different.
Mm-hmm.
So, I mean, the first one was a top view.
The second one had a top view, but it would also go into side scrolling.
So, I mean, just keep going from there.
Besides, most of the guys playing this game, their right hand should be in fine shape anyway to wag it around, right?
Yeah.
All right.
Well, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks so much for the call and enjoy Zelda, okay?
All right, I will.
All right, have a good one.
Later, 1877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
I think that was a new caller.
I don't recognize that name.
I recognize it from chat right now, but I don't think that person's called in before.
I heard a little southern accent, didn't you?
Yeah, a little.
I heard a little.
All right.
Anyhow, moving on, going back to the Twitters.
DarkTetsuya sends us a tweet.
Coming soon to Xbox Live Indie Games, Nyan Cat Adventure.
It is from the people behind Technokitten Adventure.
I guess they are actually creating a Nyan Cat game.
Um, there's already a Nyan Cat game for iPhone.
There is on iPhone, but I guess this is the official quote-unquote one that's going to be on Xbox Live.
And I like the little box art.
They have a Facebook that has some limited pictures and stuff, but I love what they did at the bottom.
They made this rip-off of the Nintendo seal of quality, and it's the official Niantendo seal.
I hope they get that by the Xbox censors.
Nintendo 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio let's see more tweets oh I like this one from Mantis Knight on Twitter one topic please discuss is is free to play MMORPGs really a good thing?
are free to play MMOs really a good thing?
hell yes
Depends who it's good for.
As far as being good to get people to try your game, yes.
Whether people try your game and then decide to pay for stuff, maybe not.
I see no problem because I mean I was paying for Star Trek Online and then had cryptic points so no big there I've heard of where free to play has kind of driven games downhill though or at least according to some of the loyal people who play the game and like one example I could think of for that is Team Fortress 2 now note I'm not saying Team Fortress 2 is a bad game it's not it's a good game
But some people, you might remember we reported on this, when Team Fortress 2 first went free to play, the community was very against that.
and well some I should say some of the community was very against that in fact they went so far remember there were some servers that would ban you if it caught that you were using the free to play version like somehow they could tell the difference and it was like we don't want these people here and sometimes an MMO is like I can imagine a game like DC Universe like one day you're paying for DC Universe right you're paying your $15 a month suddenly the game goes free to play and
Now your servers are drowning under all the people that are trying to get on the server.
And it's like where it might be a good thing that more people are playing your game, now it's all these people who didn't pay anything to get in.
So it's kind of like they might be ruining the party a little bit.
Does that make sense?
Hey, this is Cloud Cleveland.
I haven't been in a chat for a long time.
Yo, bro.
Hey, Rob, you were a Rez fan, right?
For the little Dreamcast?
Freaking love Rez.
Happy 10-year anniversary.
Hell yeah.
I know, right?
Have you gotten to play Child of Eden yet?
I do.
I have played Child of Eden.
Child of Eden, I want to play it on the PlayStation 3, for real.
I liked it, but I thought the Kinect control was a little weird.
It was cool to play once, but I prefer just playing it with a controller.
And I didn't like the music as much as I liked Rez.
I really didn't, but it was still a good game.
I've heard a lot of people say that, actually, about the music.
Mm-hmm.
It's not that it was bad, it wasn't bad by any means I'm always going to love anything Tetsuya Mizuguchi puts out But it wasn't Rez And the price was tough to swallow But there's a lot of weird stuff that comes out for a high price At least it was better than 5 cars and 3 tracks It was a better game than that, that's for sure
Okay, maybe I'll wait for it to go budget title before I actually pick it up myself.
Well, there's a lot of Black Friday games.
My gosh, dude.
As I said, my god, Mario 3D Land.
You know, between that and Kirby Return to Dream Land, those two games have really put a lot of faith into Nintendo for me.
and DarkSakura.com
How many years has it been?
God damn.
Friend codes?
Why do we always hurt the ones we love?
Right?
But then they go and they put out fucking Mario 3D Land, this Kirby game, which I hear is really good, Zelda, and supposedly, assuming Mario Kart 7 is just as good, it's like, damn.
Thanks for watching!
Oh, I know.
I mean, now it's completely worth having the Wii for me.
I've actually pulled it out of my closet just to be able to play these games.
And thankfully, you know, the 3DS didn't have to wait as long for some decent games.
And hopefully this won't be the end of it.
Yeah it's interesting there's been other stories this week that you know Reggie is saying that just because the Wii U is coming out does not mean the Wii's life cycle is done and I think a lot of us are looking at that with kind of one eyebrow raise like how are the systems going to coexist and I think you kind of have to say that to some extent because like you don't want the Wii's to stop selling this holiday season.
I still think Xenoblade's gonna come out
I think that I always go back and forth with this I swore up and down that if they didn't announce it at Penny Arcade it wasn't fucking happening but I'm kind of like you know what else do they fucking have next year they've got to have almost all of their people working on making the Wii U
Better.
Because it's gotta be better at next year's E3.
I think you're gonna see a much different system at next E3.
And I don't mean like suddenly it's not gonna have a touch screen anymore or any of that stuff.
I just mean you're gonna definitely see the games and you're gonna see the reason why Nintendo really believes in this.
You're gonna see this at E3.
Because if they can't prove that, that system is fucked.
But I think because they've got all their people working to make the Wii U great...
Right.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You don't have to do a hardware modification to it.
Will the internet collectively still care this time next year?
Because especially a game like Xenoblade is really for the core gamer.
You can't sell Xenoblade to a soccer mom with her seven-year-olds.
But Xenoblade is a really good game that if you do own a Wii, you should check out.
Alright, I want to actually look into that one.
Thanks for the suggestion.
No problem, except for unless you happen to be in Europe, you won't find it here, or you're going to have to turn to the dark side of the internet, which SOPA may eliminate, so get it now while you still can.
I don't usually advocate piracy, but when a company leaves you no other choice to play the game, I don't know what else to tell people.
Xenoblade's a great game.
Alright.
Yeah, you can't get the licensing in your country or whatever.
Other options, man.
Yep.
All right, well, anything else you want to ask or get out with the show tonight?
No, that's about it, bro.
All right, well, thanks so much for your call, and have fun with Child of Eden.
You should get it.
You're going to see a lot of good sales through the holiday, so definitely check it out.
Right.
All right, take care, buddy.
One 877 game OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
Love to hear from you.
Did I finish all the tweets or was there one?
Oh, we were still on the free-to-play thing.
We were talking about that.
And DarkSakura, you were talking about kind of even your experiences, you know, the Star Wars, or Star Trek, thank you.
I really should know better.
But it would just be certain things that I would want, and they would be very reasonable.
Like, I could get a thing of the lowest end of cryptic points or something, and it would last me through, like, months of releases.
Yeah.
So...
Since the phone's not ringing again, I think we're actually going to shut it down because believe it or not, this has been a long show tonight.
Especially considering our website is down and we weren't able to do a proper show roll.
We did a good job filling time.
So we've got to wrap up.
That was it for the tweets too.
And we've got to get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap up.
I think we already did last minute stories.
So let's get everybody's last minute thoughts.
My final thought tonight is I'm excited to go home and eat.
Yay, food.
I love food.
Loki, your final thought tonight?
Making good headway on Call of Duty 4 modding.
And last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
My night is far from over.
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
We really appreciate your support, especially when poopy things happen to us like our internet goes out so we can't do a show one week randomly or our website suddenly goes down.
We really appreciate that you guys stand by with us.
Even though I know the podcasties will be a little bit behind, we still had a very full chat room tonight and I really appreciate that, all things considered, considering we don't have a website where you can go to chat.orangenloungeradio.com or any of that.
so really appreciate you guys if you like what you heard we're not begging for your money all we ask tell people about the show word of mouth help spread the word about the show tell a person who may not have heard of it about the show and help the OL Army grow and we can spread the word the term of Xbox Lube throughout the universe
that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio we'll be back next week hopefully with a website and everything to do it all over again with next week in gaming news and I'm sure even more games to be played this week including it sounds like Mario Kart 7 by this time next week right?
the 4th oh my god so much more coming so we'll be back next week until then have a great week and don't be a dick to each other online you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
See you next week!
