00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,440
Today, November 13th, 2011, DC Universe explodes after going free to play.

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,880
The way to import UMDs to the PS Vita is revealed, and could the Wii U support multiple tablet

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,880
controllers after all?

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,080
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,800
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,920
We are live tonight, November the 13th of 2011, with the 435th episode of our show.

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,560
We are live, of course, at All Games Radio, as we are every Sunday night at www.allgames.com.

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,960
We tape live Sundays at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,040
show.

10
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,360
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,320
Say hello to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,320
Hi.

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
How are you, Jamie?

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,320
Happy.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Happy.

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,880
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
Bleh.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
All right.

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,720
Joining us in just a few moments is Techmaster Loki.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,120
He's a little late to studio tonight, I'm literally listening to him walk in right this

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
second.

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,720
I'd like to hear a little more about that excuse as to why he's getting situated right

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
now.

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
We'll come back to him in a minute.

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,720
Saints Row.

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
That's why.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Really?

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Really?

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
You stood the show up for Saints Row.

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
Are you surprised?

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Actually, no.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
Not at all.

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,920
Well, welcome, Techmaster Loki.

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,720
Let me introduce chat while you get situated real quick.

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,040
We are, of course, the show where every gamer has a voice, and we always invite your voices

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,280
via email.

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
And seriously, we need more voices via email.

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
Is it true?

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
No emails tonight?

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,040
I think everybody's too busy playing Skyrim and Modern Warfare and all that stuff.

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, the Twitter, of course, Twitter.com slash O-L-R, and our

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,560
chat room, our live chat room, chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,080
Oh, yeah, I forgot to load chat.

45
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Sorry, guys.

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,800
You might want to log into chat.

47
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,720
Actually, just before we got started with the show tonight, Amiga777 was wondering why

48
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,000
is attendance this low?

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,960
I guess our chat room is a little bit emptier than it usually is right now.

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,560
And I would say it's probably all the crazy games that are out, and it's a busy time of

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
year.

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,120
Technically, it's not the holidays yet, but let me give you this.

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,400
I went to the mall yesterday, and it was a madhouse, absolute madhouse.

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,560
I would have thought yesterday was the weekend after Thanksgiving.

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,840
It was that crowded.

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,960
So maybe that's a good sign that the economy is coming back, or maybe people just want

57
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,360
to get out and get their shopping done before all the craziness hits.

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
I don't know.

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,040
This is why I don't go to the mall at all this time of year.

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,960
I can't say I blame you, but that's where my haircut place is, so I had to go over there,

61
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,720
and there were other errands I wanted to do.

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,040
So what can you do?

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,440
Let's also introduce the chat room.

64
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,280
We're going to get to the Skype calls a little later on.

65
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Let me talk about this.

66
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,760
Speaking of deals, I wanted to start off with a discussion on this real quick, and that

67
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,800
is the Black Friday stuff that's starting to hit the internet.

68
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,360
And if you don't know what Black Friday is, I don't know what hole you've been living

69
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,680
in, but maybe you don't live in the US.

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
That could be it, too.

71
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,480
Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving here in the US, and it's usually a day that's

72
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,760
kind of the unofficial official kickoff to the holiday shopping season, and things get

73
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,200
discounted like crazy.

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,800
And some of the Black Friday ads are starting to leak out there on the internet, and you

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,720
kind of have to take a lot of what you read on the internet with a grain of salt.

76
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,880
But a website that's very respected and reputable within the gaming community, CheapAssGamer

77
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,000
at CheapAssGamer.com, is compiling some of the better deals that are going on right now.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,360
Now, I'm not going to plagiarize and read the entire list.

79
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,480
If you want to read that, you can go to their website, but I'll give you kind of some of

80
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,360
the highlights that I'm seeing here.

81
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,000
A lot of the consoles appear to be deeply discounted, including it looks like Target

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,480
is selling an Xbox 360 console for $139, the 4 gig console.

83
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,520
That's very inexpensive considering that guy is what, usually about $199?

84
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,360
That's a very deep discount.

85
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,160
PlayStation 3 seems to be $199 most places, probably the cheapest place is Walmart by

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,480
a whole 2 cents, but Best Buy and Radio Shack are deeply discounting that as well.

87
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:28,680
The Wii is down to $100, 3DS going down to $179.99, that's a bundle pack going on there.

88
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,360
I was going to say, because that's not a discount at all.

89
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,080
Right, but it's a bundle pack with a game.

90
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,280
And let's see, discounts on games.

91
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Current games.

92
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:45,520
Batman Arkham City, going to be $28 at Walmart, $29 at Best Buy, Elder Scrolls, Skyrim, it's

93
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,320
still $60 but you can get a $10 gift card at Target.

94
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,840
Gears of War 3 for $28 at Walmart, Need for Speed The Run, $30 at Best Buy.

95
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,040
Some pretty good deals throughout there.

96
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,720
And again, that list I was reading from is just CheapAssGamer.com, they have a little

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,920
compilation going on there.

98
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,680
That's their specialty, is looking at game deals.

99
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,440
But I wanted to kind of ask the folks at the studio here, do you get excited about Black

100
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
Friday?

101
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Is that something you think you might participate in for some of these deals?

102
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,280
Or are you like, hell no, get me the hell away from those stores.

103
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
No.

104
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
No?

105
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,560
I don't have anything I don't already want.

106
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,360
So if you want something, you just go get it.

107
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,280
Having gone out to stores on Black Friday before?

108
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,080
No, I'll be staying inside.

109
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,360
I mean, really, I can get just as good deals online.

110
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,600
And I know people who are going.

111
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,400
So if they're going to be there anyway, I just say, okay, you do this for me.

112
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
Besides, it's all about Cyber Monday.

113
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,360
Cyber Monday, I don't have to go anywhere.

114
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,580
I just sit down and deals come to me.

115
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,580
That's true.

116
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm a little more into the Cyber Monday.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,760
I have never gone out on Black Friday, but some of these deals, I don't know, they have

118
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,880
me thinking there's some good game prices.

119
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
You know who doesn't last?

120
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Steam.

121
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
I'm looking forward to Steam.

122
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, I was going to say, Cyber Monday, that's a big Steam thing right there.

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh yeah.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
That day is going to hurt on Steam, that's for sure.

125
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Anyway.

126
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,440
But I mean, really, the only things that I could possibly want slash need is I'd like

127
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,820
a new laptop.

128
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,080
That's about it.

129
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,100
I would like for my current computer to not be a piece of shit, which it won't be once

130
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,560
I put Windows 7 and Linux Mint on it because that's coming soon.

131
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
I was surprised.

132
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,480
You told me the other day you were still running Vista and I was like, oh, poor thing.

133
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,560
Because I've had problems going on.

134
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,880
But I mean, right now, honestly, given my situation, I'm just lucky to have a roof over

135
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,080
my head.

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm happy to have food to eat.

137
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,360
I'm happy to have stuff to wear.

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
So quite honestly...

139
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,840
You're being very zen about the whole thing.

140
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,480
You're just very like, you know, I don't need material possessions.

141
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,080
Well, it's not really so much of a that.

142
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,440
It's just that having been slapped in my, you know, in the face with the possibility

143
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,080
of maybe being homeless or having nothing to eat.

144
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
You're not going to be homeless.

145
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,520
But it's sort, it's sort of realigned my, um, my values, I guess.

146
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
My perspective.

147
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Yeah, I gotcha.

148
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,880
I used to really dread turning 30, but then when I was really sick in 2008, which you

149
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,280
guys might remember, like I was like, hey, turning 30 is awesome because I actually live

150
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
to be 30.

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,000
Life is actually better once you're 30 too.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It really is.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,560
But anyway, that's, that's, that's for another, that's for the zen show, which will be our

154
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
third podcast.

155
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,040
But I mean, seriously, it was just sort of like, you know, if, if I want to, if I want

156
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,560
these games, I can rent them if I really want to play it.

157
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,800
You know, I've got tons of games that I've, you know, hardly played.

158
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,080
I've just, um, uh, started project diva, which is fun.

159
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,840
Well, we'll get into that in a minute during gaming weeks, but let me go to some of the

160
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,840
comments from our chat room at chat.orangelandrady.com.

161
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,760
Hitstun says, I get roughly half my Christmas shopping done on black Friday.

162
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,480
Salacious Pop says, fuck the mall, seriously, maybe fries.

163
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,760
It's the only in real life store I'd go to.

164
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
That's, that's the worst.

165
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,480
Do you not go to fries and black Friday if you want to go to fries and watch the guy

166
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,720
walking around with like a balloon that says line ends here and then you watch it snake

167
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
through the entire store.

168
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,640
Yeah, I did that one time cause I, I think it was actually living with you at the time.

169
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,520
Yeah, I think I was buying like a replacement motherboard or something cause my computer

170
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,760
had died and, and I went there and that line took like an hour and a half to go through

171
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
black again.

172
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,680
Actually, I have gone out at black Friday, but I went out like right before the store's

173
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,040
closed when it's more normal, like everybody's gone.

174
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,320
Granted, you won't get some of the deep, deep deals at that time cause a lot of stuff is

175
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,640
sold out, but there's still a lot of good stuff on the shelves.

176
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,400
It's not like everything is suddenly missing from the shelves when you go there.

177
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
So I don't know.

178
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,840
I've seen some good deals then.

179
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,440
Um, let's see.

180
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,520
Act Def says, I got my dream cast for $50 on a black Friday sale.

181
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
That's pretty awesome.

182
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,080
A game grew says, I got my 360 on a black Friday a few years back.

183
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,560
Uh, Eric K says, I black Friday on Amazon and Amiga seven, seven, seven says, what's

184
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
a fries?

185
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
And that's right.

186
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
They don't have them everywhere.

187
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,120
It's think, uh, like a best buy.

188
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
That's like three times as big.

189
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,920
That's kind of what a fries is.

190
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,360
This sells, you know, a lot of electronic and appliances and all that.

191
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,240
That's pretty much what a fries is, right?

192
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
So a lot of good deals.

193
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,080
They sell a lot more components than a bad really crappy toys that you don't need.

194
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,520
All right.

195
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,760
And food like nerd food.

196
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
That's that's the other weird thing.

197
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,320
Yeah, astronaut ice cream.

198
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,800
Best Buy does kind of have that though.

199
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,880
They have like the movie food at their counter.

200
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
So whatever.

201
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Anyway.

202
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
All right.

203
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
That's comments from our chat.

204
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,240
Not only can you get your, you know, games and stuff like that, you can get stuff to

205
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:44,400
outfit a convenience store, including a, um, cotton candy maker, a hot dog, um, cooker

206
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,080
and uh, all sorts of things.

207
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Yeah.

208
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Just random stuff.

209
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,680
Not that I've ever bought any of that shit at fries, but I've thought about it.

210
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,840
I'm like, did you get your deep fryer at fries?

211
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
No, that was a Christmas gift.

212
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
That's right.

213
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
That's right.

214
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
All right.

215
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Another one, but the wife won't let me.

216
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
All right.

217
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,640
Anyhow, uh, we're going to go on and, uh, talk about our gaming weeks and the types

218
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,560
of video games that we have been playing this week.

219
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,800
Um, we'll start off with dark soccer.

220
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,320
I know you mentioned project diva.

221
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,480
Yeah, I will have started it and then remembered that I had to write a research paper.

222
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,840
So I turned it off.

223
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm trying to actually find the, um, our, uh, charger for our PSP so that I can, um,

224
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,600
take it with me to school, but it's, it's cute.

225
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Very pretty.

226
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,600
And, um, I played some well, I'm almost level 60 from on gyaru.

227
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,840
That's the one in the Horde house Guild, right?

228
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Yeah.

229
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
The one in the courthouse Guild.

230
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Good times.

231
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
I'm really enjoying priests.

232
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,120
I never thought I would really like it, which I should plug that on this show, like our

233
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Horde house Guild.

234
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,560
And of course there's a spinoff show that I host, um, the best little Horde house in

235
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,400
Azeroth at Horde house.com, which is the Warcraft show.

236
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,080
Dark soccer has been a guest several times, but usually it's my co-host is a guy named

237
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,560
Exifer who's very vulgar.

238
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,000
Well, it's an explicit show, uh, but it's fun.

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,800
And uh, we play on the drendon server Horde side in a Guild called the best little Horde

240
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,640
house and we are in, or no best little Horde house.

241
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
It's in the Guild finder.

242
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,080
Very easy to find.

243
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,000
And um, yeah, you can play with dark soccer and I know you could just ask my druid is

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,320
there gordita, but you need to come back and we need to do pally pals.

245
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Yeah.

246
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
We were having fun with Rob.

247
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,760
Rob and I have paladins that look oddly related.

248
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,280
I have a paladin named diabetes.

249
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,560
Mine's named Sylviara, but I actually tried to make a decent name.

250
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,960
I could have named her cotton candy.

251
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,220
I decided since they weren't going to give me the walrus people so I could have a walrus

252
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,400
named diabetes.

253
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,240
I guess I'll just have a paladin.

254
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:44,840
I made you a Tuscar in the, um, the, the, uh, model viewer named Wilford.

255
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,640
I made it an honor of you.

256
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Nice.

257
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,320
I'm laughing at the salacious pop in our chat room that says Rob is going to come home with

258
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,800
a churro machine now.

259
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,120
Do they sell those at fries?

260
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,000
Cause if so, that's on my holiday list.

261
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,080
You know, I don't know, but I'm serious to go over there.

262
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,280
It's the imply.

263
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,820
It's part of the appliance section, at least in our local one over here in Roseville goddamn

264
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,820
churro machine.

265
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,160
Do you know how popular I'd be?

266
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,840
It's like, I'd be like having Disneyland in my house.

267
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,960
I live in the cat bathroom so I could always have, if they have a slurpee machine there,

268
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,600
I will have a slurpee machine anyway.

269
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
I know what I'm getting.

270
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
You Rob.

271
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Sorry.

272
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,480
It's more of a gift for, for salacious pop.

273
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Oh wait.

274
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,760
Why would you get me a gift for him?

275
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,880
Because you'll benefit from it.

276
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Okay.

277
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Oh, I see.

278
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,120
It's something where it's like, it'll keep him busy so I can do what I want.

279
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
No.

280
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Okay.

281
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
All right.

282
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Anyhow, back to games you've been playing.

283
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Wow.

284
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,760
Um, I really haven't had a whole lot of time for games.

285
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,480
As I said last week, we were, we, uh, had to finish compiling the magazine this week.

286
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,960
So most of my time has been spent at school.

287
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:53,760
Um, so I did like a little bit of flash gaming and rearranged my entire portable hard drive,

288
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,880
uh, because, uh, I was hanging out with the art director while he was finishing the compiling

289
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,160
and I had to do last minute corrections and stuff.

290
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,200
Um, that's all done.

291
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Hopefully we go to print.

292
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,040
Um, I think tomorrow or Tuesday.

293
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,080
So now that that's done, now my research papers written, I won't have to hear you talk about

294
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
it anymore.

295
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
Yay.

296
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,120
I'm expecting everyone to buy an issue.

297
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Seriously.

298
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
I will.

299
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,540
You'll have my eternal gratitude if you buy an issue of the American river review and

300
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,840
can see all my gorgeous work.

301
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
That's okay.

302
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
I have enough issues already.

303
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
You've got subscriptions.

304
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,320
What are you talking about?

305
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
But I'm running low on toilet paper.

306
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,320
Dan finished Arkham city.

307
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Oh yeah.

308
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,040
And he finished all the missions.

309
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Nice.

310
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Has he found every, every Riddler trophy?

311
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,120
I doubt it.

312
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,360
He has found enough to find Riddler.

313
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Nice.

314
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,600
So he beat Riddler, which is kind of a let down.

315
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Really?

316
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
I mean, it's funny.

317
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,440
I have to say Riddler sets off my Gator.

318
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,840
Riddler is kind of like, it's going to sound really weird, but Riddler's kind of hot.

319
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,280
Like it depends on which Riddler we're talking about.

320
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,120
This Riddler is like, not so much like Frank Gorshin Riddler from sixties Batman, but I'm

321
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,040
talking like when they tried to make Riddler very Metro sexual, I was going to say Metro,

322
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,920
but he sets off, but he actually does set off my Gator.

323
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
All right.

324
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,180
This is the first time I've ever had a character in a game set off my infallible Gator.

325
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,600
It's the greatest question of all.

326
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,360
Yeah.

327
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,680
And then Dan did the whole thing with Catwoman.

328
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,680
You know, when you go back to help Batman instead, he did the thing where she leaves

329
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,800
him.

330
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,280
I don't know that part yet, so you better not be spoiling her.

331
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
I'll come over there and kick your butt.

332
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
It's just funny.

333
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,320
You should do it at least once cause you can, you can go back and fix it.

334
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,760
But I hear story mode is actually not that long.

335
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
All things considered.

336
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,440
No, the, the, the primary missions are really not that long, but there's so much else to

337
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
do.

338
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,040
Like the hush ones are really cool because I'm not a big Batman reader.

339
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,600
You know, I don't like DC comics, but I read my, one of my favorite Batman things I've

340
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,200
ever read was heart of hush.

341
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,200
And that was a really good actual Batman Catwoman story.

342
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,120
And I kind of like the dynamic that the two have in the game.

343
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,600
Do you know why I love Batman?

344
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,760
And it's, it's not, I'm actually not a big comic reader, although I don't know, like

345
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,140
I'm sitting here reading comic, funny enough salacious pop, but we, we went to a brand

346
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,480
new comic book store out in a Thomas, like some brand new place that just opened up like

347
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,560
a month ago and he bought the killing joke.

348
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
The killing joke is very good.

349
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,720
And so I was thinking I might steal that and read it because I don't use, I'm not like

350
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
a comic reader.

351
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
It's not that I dislike them.

352
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
I just, I don't know.

353
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
It's a fucked up story.

354
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Yeah, I know.

355
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
I know.

356
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,560
But like the reason why I love Batman so much is not just the movies, which were brilliant,

357
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,840
but seriously growing up, I think I saw every single episode of the old Batman series from

358
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,040
the sixties with Adam West.

359
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,200
No, I did not grow up in the sixties, but they reran them all the time.

360
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,600
But Julie Newmar was my hero.

361
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Oh, she's great.

362
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,960
And it's really sad that they don't rerun them now.

363
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,480
I think they do, but it's on a very obscure network.

364
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
It's not like it's on FX anymore.

365
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,800
You can still find it somewhere.

366
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
That's right there.

367
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,720
Perfect adult swim material, I'm telling you.

368
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:08,520
But it's just, I like all the nods to, and even someone like me who isn't totally into

369
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,200
Batman, like there's a few characters in there that I know they're Batman characters, but

370
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
I don't know who they are.

371
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,500
Like I knew Solomon Grundy was a Batman character, but I had no idea who exactly he was.

372
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,920
For me, I love the art and the game.

373
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,040
So I've just been sitting there watching him because I'm looking at the scenery.

374
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,600
And for me, like my favorite places when they go, I don't know if you've been there yet,

375
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,720
but the Wonder City underground, the sunken streets.

376
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,460
I've been in a subway system underground.

377
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,880
Under the subway, closer to where Wonder Tower is, you can go underground and it's like this

378
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,440
World's Fair exhibition, but it's all these city streets, like little, you know, with

379
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,640
buggies and everything, only it's all torn up.

380
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,360
But a lot of the artwork in there is very Art Nouveau.

381
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,800
I'm up to the, just to give you an idea where I'm at in the story, keep in mind, I have

382
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,560
done some of the side quests, like some of the Zazz stuff, which that guy's scary.

383
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,160
But okay, was it just me or does the voice sound like a woman at first?

384
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
He just sounds like he has a problem.

385
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,040
But he sounded like a woman.

386
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
You want to give him a hug, but you don't.

387
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,800
I'll carve your name into my skin.

388
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,600
You put the notion in the basket.

389
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,240
The chat room is reminding us that they do rerun them on the hub.

390
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,680
Okay, the hub.

391
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Is that really, okay.

392
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
There you go.

393
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
All right.

394
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,320
But anyway, I was going to say, I am at the point in the game, I'm in the museum and-

395
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,640
So you're hunting penguin.

396
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Sort of.

397
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,240
We just kicked some of his henchman's ass and then we were at this part with boats and

398
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,720
you're having to use the grappling hook to-

399
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
That's annoying.

400
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
Oh my God.

401
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
I was so frustrated.

402
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,880
Do you know how many times I've been eaten by a shark?

403
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,200
And you know how many more times you're going to have to do shit like that in the game?

404
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Ugh.

405
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,440
Wait, wait, so you get-

406
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Otherwise I love it.

407
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,240
Wait, so you get the cryo bomb.

408
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
All right.

409
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Cause you-

410
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Can't wait.

411
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
All right.

412
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
You throw it in the water.

413
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Or else it gets the hose again.

414
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
You know what though?

415
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,080
You know what we want to know what's really annoying is going and trying to do all that

416
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,080
shit with Catwoman.

417
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,840
But keep in mind, she can climb on the ceiling.

418
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,000
Dude, the Catwoman parts are my favorite so far.

419
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Like that part-

420
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I love her whip.

421
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,240
Her and Poison Ivy, she's so much fun to battle with.

422
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Anyway, sorry.

423
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,480
That's, that's, that's hotness.

424
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
Her and Poison Ivy.

425
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
She is, she is pretty hot.

426
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,840
In fact, I think in the chat room, Tiger Claw asked hotter than Catwoman, I think in reference

427
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
to my Riddler reference.

428
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,960
Oh, I mean, it kind of depends on what you're into, but you know, I'm very secure in my

429
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,560
homosexuality when I say this, Catwoman has a nice rack.

430
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,240
It's, it's the, uh, the new style Catwoman too.

431
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,480
So she's probably fucking Batman.

432
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,320
Like any minute that, that zipper's just going to fly open and go woohoo.

433
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,960
So yeah, so while I haven't been playing it, I've really been getting into it.

434
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,240
Um, just like I said, for me, it's going around and looking at everything and really taking

435
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,480
in the scenery and Dan will actually just stop and go exploring places for me so I can

436
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
see it.

437
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
All right.

438
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
That's fun.

439
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
So it's pretty cool.

440
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,600
The other night I was playing with a group of friends and they were like, go in the place

441
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,760
that says live nude girls.

442
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,040
There's a place that says live nude girls, go in the door.

443
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
There's two signs.

444
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Live nude girls.

445
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Yeah.

446
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
I think you can go in there.

447
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Yeah.

448
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
The door was locked.

449
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
I'm assuming maybe it comes into play later.

450
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,760
I really, oh really?

451
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,920
I assumed it was a Riddler room that came up later or something.

452
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,200
Some of those, some of the speculation Riddler room wouldn't be at live nude girls.

453
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Yeah.

454
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Yeah.

455
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Oh my.

456
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,680
His little hideout by the way is fucking sadistic.

457
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
I love it.

458
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,920
So, um, but yeah, tiger class says, you know, you can punch the shark.

459
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
Really?

460
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm going to do that next time.

461
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm going to tell Dan to go punch the shark.

462
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm going to shoot him in the face.

463
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,480
You cannot jump it.

464
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,640
Anyhow, so you need to move on.

465
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
Sorry.

466
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,600
So really the, that's been what my gaming week has been.

467
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,920
Um, I'm planning on, uh, now that I've got my research paper done, I've got like one

468
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,440
more paper that I've got to do with my group, but we're review, we have to pick a piece

469
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
of art.

470
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,440
So we're doing the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

471
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
Good times.

472
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,640
Cause we, cause half the group's like into, into modern, you know, movies and stuff.

473
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
And he said, we could do a movie.

474
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,840
So I was like, we're going to do a Rocky shit.

475
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,120
So they were coming over Tuesday to do the time warp.

476
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Good times.

477
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,640
And, um, so when that's all done, I'm going to play the shit out of Project Diva.

478
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,680
All right.

479
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Hell yeah.

480
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,880
All right, Loki, need I ask, how was your gaming week?

481
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,000
Um, very fulfilling.

482
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,080
Not play a lot of things this week, actually.

483
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,600
Uh, of course, Grand Theft Auto, um, which is kind of funny because Grand Theft Auto,

484
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,880
I think we're, uh, transitioning onto a new game after seven years or so.

485
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,760
Gee, what could that possibly be?

486
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,280
Call of Duty, modern warfare.

487
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
What?

488
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,360
I thought for sure you were going to say Saints Row.

489
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,560
No, it doesn't have multiplayer in it.

490
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,120
No death match in it.

491
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Oh, really?

492
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,840
It has co-op, but not death match.

493
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
Yes.

494
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Oh, okay.

495
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
Okay.

496
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
So wait a minute.

497
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Wait a minute.

498
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Wait a minute.

499
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Okay.

500
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
So now you're, you're all about Call of Duty, modern warfare, like three, the new one.

501
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
No one.

502
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,600
Well, Call of Duty for modern warfare.

503
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Oh, okay.

504
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,560
So that one, because it's cheap, you know, you have to buy five copies.

505
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
I see.

506
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,800
So you're starting with the, you know, one you could get for $9.99 these days and exactly

507
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
so.

508
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,260
So that's what we're playing.

509
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,760
And the only reason that they're switching to it is because they got tired of me beating

510
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,120
them.

511
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,260
And I'm happy to report that our first game that we played on it, I nearly, well, I doubled

512
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,840
second place's scores, so, uh, I'm still going to beat them in this game.

513
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,080
So I don't know what the point was in switching, but whatever.

514
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
They want to mix it up.

515
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,560
I have an important news flash.

516
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
What?

517
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Dan brought me pizza.

518
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Did he bring me pizza?

519
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
You can get some.

520
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
I'm just kidding.

521
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
I'll wait.

522
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,800
Um, and then other than that, let's see, I played Zelda, the four swords adventure on,

523
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,120
um, the 3DS or DS, I guess it's off of the store.

524
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,480
Um, it's all right, but I think definitely more of a game for more than one person and

525
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,920
not too fun playing it by herself.

526
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,400
And um, I don't know, it's all right, but yeah, definitely more fun with more people.

527
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
And then, yeah, yeah, yeah.

528
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,640
I played saints for the third, which is just amazing.

529
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,180
Um, I'm actually about 13 hours into it already and it's just great.

530
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,400
It's every bit of awesome that I wanted it to be.

531
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
It is.

532
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,240
And then some, there's gotta be something negative, something you're not happy about.

533
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,600
Ah, the escort missions are still annoying because the AI is still kind of eh.

534
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,960
It's a little bit glitchy now and then, but not anything that really hurts the game.

535
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Just like funny stuff.

536
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,080
Like I'll finish a tank mission or something and when I'm done there's corpses stuck in

537
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,320
the ground and you can walk up to them and they kind of like bounce around back and forth

538
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
and stuff.

539
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,480
It's the same shit that's funny in Skyrim.

540
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,280
Like mammoths just randomly falling from the sky and all that.

541
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Just random stuff.

542
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,640
And that's fine, you know, the games, I expect that game to be slightly buggy because that's

543
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,760
how Singing Spyro is.

544
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,640
It's just slightly buggy and it's fine.

545
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
It makes it more funny.

546
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,880
I gotta say though, the missions are great.

547
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,220
Just what I've played so far.

548
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:17,560
They have some really good kind of direction to them and there's even some that have kind

549
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,200
of music that plays along with it that's just really awesome.

550
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,120
It just sets the mood so well.

551
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,020
How does the game, like, you know, keep in mind I haven't played a lot of the Saints

552
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,020
Row games.

553
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:33,160
I played the first one for like an hour, but like, how does it transition from all these

554
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,400
bits of randomness one to another because isn't it a very open world game and like when

555
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,360
I started seeing all this stuff like that there's Tron's parodies in it and all these

556
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,560
things I was like how do they, how do they work that all into the game?

557
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,400
How does it go from one parody to another?

558
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,220
It works really well actually and like the very beginning, the first few missions, actually

559
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,240
quite a bit of the missions.

560
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,160
I think I was up through 20% of the game and it was still doing tutorial missions I guess

561
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,840
to kind of introduce you to the different activities that you can do in the game.

562
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,400
And um, you know, it's really strange sometimes.

563
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:18,320
Like for example, there's one that you're being trained by, by this one Saint that you

564
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:25,520
pick up who's voiced by Hulk Hogan and he's training you to be able to confront Kilbane

565
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,280
who's this luchador, the leader of the luchador gang or whatever in there and stuff.

566
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:38,280
And so it's almost like a little bit of Karate Kid sort of and it's great because one of

567
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,160
the songs in the game is the best from Karate Kid.

568
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,400
You're the best around.

569
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Yes exactly.

570
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,560
And they actually have that in the part when you first talk to the guy and stuff.

571
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:58,160
So he's having you feel pain so one of the missions that you do, it's basically an activity.

572
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,960
So there's lots of pop culture references left and right essentially.

573
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,960
It's not all pop culture references, I mean it's just really over the top.

574
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,700
Just very big action sequences.

575
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,200
How many people have you slapped in the face of the dildo?

576
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
I don't know.

577
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,640
But I think it keeps the stats for that.

578
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
You lost count.

579
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,380
I mean come on.

580
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,380
This game has...

581
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,760
How many whores have you killed?

582
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
I don't know.

583
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,200
I don't think I've killed that many whores.

584
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,360
There aren't that many whores.

585
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,720
There's some strange shit, okay?

586
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,360
Like seriously, you'll be walking around all of a sudden, you know, there's gimps walking

587
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,480
around and then these furries walking around, it's like what the hell is going on?

588
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,220
Today, and I think this is an Easter egg, today I ran across, you know, Genki, the cathead

589
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,600
guy that's running this Japanese game show or whatever, the mascot for this game almost

590
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
died.

591
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,640
All of a sudden, I see him running around the street shooting people with rocket launchers.

592
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,520
What the fuck is he doing out here?

593
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,200
And so I went to go try to kill him, and I did manage to kill him finally, but it took

594
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
a lot.

595
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,160
I think it glitched him underneath a dump truck or something that crushed him to death.

596
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,880
Kaijuto in our chat room is asking, Loki, did they fix the camera and the driving in

597
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,040
Saints 3?

598
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,120
The bad camera and the bad driving killed Saints 2 for me.

599
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:22,040
Yes, they fixed the driving, the driving is awesome, really, really fun.

600
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,640
Camera I didn't really have a problem with the camera in 3, so I didn't notice if the

601
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,720
camera is, I think it's fixed, I mean, like I said, I don't have any problems with it,

602
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,860
but the driving is great.

603
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,100
So there's no real multiplayer in this?

604
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,400
It's co-op, you can do co-op campaign, and then you can also do horde mode, which is,

605
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,520
you know, the really ridiculous stuff.

606
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,200
You get to be the whore, right?

607
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,280
No, it's just a horde mode, some waves have whores in them, some of them you're shrunken

608
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:56,000
down really small, some of them you're really big, just ridiculous stuff.

609
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,400
I'm trying to think of some really strange stuff.

610
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Oh, I have a gun now that I can fire at a car that allows me to control it like an RC

611
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,880
car, which is kind of fun.

612
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,040
Wow, that sounds like Driver.

613
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:12,960
You have parachutes that you can use whenever, so you can just skydive off a building.

614
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,320
You should have wingsuits.

615
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,080
They don't have any wingsuits, unfortunately.

616
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,220
Are you having a lot of fun?

617
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,480
It sounds to me like you're just able to sandbox.

618
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:29,280
It's great, it's seriously a fun, fun game, you know, yeah, I mean, I'm going to be playing

619
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,440
it right here in the show, a little bit.

620
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,800
All right, anything else to say on Saints Row for now?

621
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,280
Definitely pick it up, it's a great game, I mean, it's worth it, and I've seen some

622
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,280
of the reviewers bitching about how the missions were very linear, dude, it's a mission, it's

623
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,280
supposed to be linear.

624
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,320
I don't understand what they're looking for.

625
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,960
There's just so many games out right now, like, I can't pick up Saints Row right now,

626
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,160
there's too much, too much!

627
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,720
All right, going to my gaming week, I played more Batman Arkham City, which I guess I've

628
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,960
already dished on with Jamie a little bit, but I'm just having fun just exploring some

629
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,280
of the side missions and trying to do the main stuff as well, and you know, I already

630
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,520
talked about where I was at in the game, and it's great, I'm loving that game, it's truly

631
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,940
one of the best of the year, it really is, and that's so not the type of game I usually

632
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,080
get into, but it's just, a good game is a good game, it transcends that.

633
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,960
One other game I've been playing a lot of this week, I'm sure will come as no surprise

634
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,200
to anyone, Skyrim.

635
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,400
I picked up on Friday, had it delivered on release day, I've been playing Skyrim quite

636
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,460
a bit since Friday, and you know, it's very similar to Oblivion, where you can, once you

637
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,820
do the very first quest in the beginning, you can pretty much go out in the world and

638
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,920
do whatever you want, and I think that openness really turns some people off.

639
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,860
And I was really giving this some thought earlier today, it's really funny because we

640
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,440
consider Oblivion a role-playing game, and we consider the Final Fantasy series a role-playing

641
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,680
game, when in reality, the two could not be any more different.

642
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,920
Those games are so, so different.

643
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,060
I mean seriously, put them side by side.

644
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,760
Final Fantasy XIII, criticized by many for being too linear.

645
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,360
I disagree, I think that was kind of a big part of Final Fantasy XIII, it was very, very

646
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
story-driven.

647
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,600
Skyrim, not linear whatsoever.

648
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,000
I mean yes, there's a main quest, but there's about 11 billion other things you can do outside

649
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
that main quest.

650
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,400
In fact, now there's this whole, it randomly generates quests.

651
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,680
Is this like Fable?

652
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
It's crazy.

653
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
No, it's better than Fable, I'm sorry.

654
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,800
I meant like, though, in terms of its exploration.

655
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,720
I guess, yeah, because some of the more recent Fable games, you kind of go around and do

656
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,120
whatever, but it's just even on a bigger scale.

657
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,000
It's just I love the fact that in Skyrim, and they've been saying this a lot, you look

658
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,240
at the top of a mountain, you can climb that mountain.

659
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,240
And anywhere you look at from the top of that mountain, you can walk to.

660
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,160
It might take you a while to get there, but you can do it.

661
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,640
There might be some mammoths and giants in your way not wanting you to get there, but

662
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
you can do it.

663
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,720
And just so many randomly generated things that just kind of make you look away.

664
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,040
And I think in that sense, you know, again, to compare with Final Fantasy 13, there sometimes

665
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,960
is a bit of a grind to it.

666
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
There's numbers.

667
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
You want to out-level.

668
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,400
And, you know, there is a lot of fun.

669
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,480
I love Final Fantasy.

670
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
I'm not dogging that at all.

671
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,560
In fact, I think Final Fantasy 13 was really underrated by a lot of the gaming media.

672
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
I think it's a great game.

673
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,500
But Skyrim is just so different.

674
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,300
But you can't approach Skyrim like you do a Final Fantasy game, or you're setting yourself

675
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,480
up for trouble.

676
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,760
And that can be really hard because there's a lot of people where it's like, I gotta do,

677
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,440
and I gotta see everything in the game, and I gotta not screw this up because I want to

678
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
get the perfect ending.

679
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,940
And it's like, you can't have that in a game that is randomly generating quests.

680
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,560
If you can't put that aside, you're gonna be in trouble.

681
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,200
I saw some pretty funny videos for Skyrim.

682
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,680
Because, you know, like, one of my favorite things about games is how they're slightly

683
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
buggy.

684
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,760
And Oblivion was slightly buggy and it was great.

685
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,480
But I don't know if you've seen the video where you put a pot on someone's head.

686
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Yes.

687
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
Yes.

688
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
And you suddenly can't see.

689
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
That's great.

690
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:07,680
Which is funny, because in that video, I recognized it, I was like, oh, I did that guy's quest.

691
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,440
By the way, spoiler, if you do his quest to get the dragon claw, you will actually complete

692
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,320
a story quest ahead of time.

693
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,880
Just throwing it out there.

694
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,320
Pro tip from me.

695
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,620
But anyway, it's a great game.

696
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,040
It's gorgeous to look at.

697
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,080
It's fun.

698
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,880
You just log in, you can do whatever you want.

699
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,560
There's so much to do.

700
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,800
So much to explore.

701
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,360
That sense of gratification.

702
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,200
So many ways to develop your character.

703
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,480
You don't pick a class anymore.

704
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,120
You're not a wizard or a warrior or anything.

705
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,340
It's just, if you happen to use swords a lot, you skill up in swords.

706
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,880
If you happen to stealth around a lot, you sneak up, you level up in sneaking.

707
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,000
I mean, it's just awesome.

708
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,440
It builds the character as you play it, which is great.

709
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,520
And then the constellation talentry system is great too.

710
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,480
You can effectively make a battle mage.

711
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,320
Yeah, that's actually what I'm playing right now, pretty much.

712
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,000
Yeah, it's pretty fun.

713
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,240
Some of the very minor drawbacks I can think of, and like, you know, there are still some

714
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,800
surprising bugs in the game, despite how polished it's, you know, supposed to be after five

715
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,560
years of development, some very obvious bugs.

716
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:20,400
Let me tell you, I'm going to say the most nitpicky, crazy thing about a game, like ever,

717
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,600
that this seriously is something that I find a little odd.

718
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,240
And believe it or not, this is something that's going to appeal to Dark Sakura.

719
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,340
It's the design, the menu design.

720
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,880
And this is going to be really nerdy.

721
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,020
Like the nerdiest thing you're ever going to hear in a game reveal.

722
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:41,500
I find the usage of a narrow sans serif font to be very strange and conflicting to the

723
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,960
ambience of what these games are supposed to be about.

724
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,640
You know, I am dead fucking serious.

725
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,320
Like when I look at it, I'm like this, it has this very modern look to it, but I'm not

726
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,460
playing Fallout.

727
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,620
I'm playing, I'm not saying everything has to be scripty and ye olde and papyrus and

728
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
all that garbage.

729
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,620
I'm not saying that.

730
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,720
I'm just like, it just looks very modern.

731
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,440
You saw it, like I made you look at the interface, right?

732
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Yeah, I looked at it.

733
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,120
It has a very modern look to it, which is weird.

734
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:18,440
You know, for that type of game, I really would agree with you, except that the thinner,

735
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:24,560
the, the, the, the light styles of sans serifs always make me think of a little bit of an

736
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:31,680
ethereal quality, but I, I would have think that it should have been something a little

737
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,100
bit more on the script side.

738
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,120
It's also that it's the same font everywhere too, which is a little weird.

739
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,480
It's like going to target and everything's set in Arial, not Arial, Helvetica.

740
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,040
And you know me, I love Helvetica, but sometimes I'm sick of Helvetica, especially after looking

741
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,060
at the damn magazine and everything's set in Helvetica.

742
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,160
Sometimes you say to hell with Helvetica.

743
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
To Helvetica.

744
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Yeah.

745
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Well I'll use Arial.

746
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Go to Helvetica.

747
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,080
No, I'll use Arial when it snows in Helvetica.

748
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,960
But like, well I don't know what the font is in Skyrim, but it's like an Arial narrow

749
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,920
and it's like, you know, there's only so much of that I can take.

750
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,160
You know what Arial is?

751
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
What?

752
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
Poor man's Helvetica.

753
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
All right.

754
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
Anyway.

755
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,440
Well no, for serious, because Microsoft made that because they didn't want to pay for Helvetica.

756
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,440
The end.

757
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
It's the truth.

758
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,460
Um, at least it's not like set in fucking comic sans or something.

759
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,460
That's true.

760
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,460
That's true.

761
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,320
Or Papyrus is another gag me font.

762
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,320
I know.

763
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
I know.

764
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:32,940
But it seemed the look of it made me think that it was a placeholder text and that they

765
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,360
just didn't change it.

766
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,800
Honestly, this is the most extreme nitpicky thing I have ever talked about in a video

767
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
game.

768
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,080
Otherwise the game is fantastic and do not let my bitching about the font deter your

769
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
opinion.

770
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,320
I don't really care for the, uh, the, the, the high renders of everything in the menu

771
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,680
because if someone's running it on a PC, that's going to slow down their time runs pretty

772
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,200
decent on most PCs.

773
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,320
But um, the other thing I did think was weird was that I didn't like how there was like

774
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,440
two different menus.

775
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,320
Like there's one menu to bring up your quest log and stuff, but then there's another button

776
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,120
you have to hit if you want your map or spells or the constellation.

777
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,600
I kind of wish that had all been integrated into one menu.

778
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,480
I thought that was kind of just odd.

779
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,320
It felt really weird to play and I'm not sure why it was designed that way.

780
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,340
I didn't like having two menus because I keep thinking that the map is in the start key

781
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,340
and it's not.

782
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,280
It's in the O or the circle.

783
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,680
So this is weird.

784
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:35,400
Um, uh, to, uh, answer, I wonder who persisted the IKEA font change.

785
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
I did.

786
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,780
IKEA always needs to use Futura forever.

787
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,600
This is Typography Lounge Radio.

788
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
All right.

789
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,720
Look, I look, the game is fantastic, but it is a different type of role playing game.

790
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:56,800
It's not for everybody, but if you, if you just, in some ways it's like an MMO where

791
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,080
you don't have to deal with other people at all.

792
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
That's awesome.

793
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,920
It has that open world sense to it and there's so much that you can interact with and do

794
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,520
in the whole like quests forever type of thing almost feels like an MMO, but without everything

795
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,720
that people hate about MMOs, which is other people usually.

796
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,200
So and a monthly fee.

797
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,600
So but Skyrim is great.

798
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,160
Great, great, great.

799
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,000
Um, otherwise that's, that's been most of my week right there.

800
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,840
Derek Tetsuya asks if it's time for the classic font of the week.

801
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,280
I'm much more prone to use the word typeface.

802
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,640
I think it sounds a little bit classier.

803
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,120
Our comments from chat.orangeloungeradio.com of course.

804
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
All right.

805
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,040
That's the, the typeface of the week is Adobe Caslon Pro.

806
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,120
Stop.

807
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,840
No one curr.

808
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,160
All right.

809
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,680
We're going to get into some gaming news tonight, of course, with you guys live in our chat

810
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,840
room and the calls later on classic game of the week and all that stuff.

811
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
First some other quick plugs.

812
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,120
Again, if you're not already following us on Facebook, you should be facebook.com slash

813
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,600
orangeloungeradio and we are on Twitter as well, twitter.com slash olr.

814
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,720
We are also now on Google plus.

815
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,800
We have a brand new Google plus page page.

816
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,540
I know it's a reason to go back and look at Google plus, but um, here's what I really

817
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,640
like about Google plus is that because thanks to the whole circle thing, we could actually

818
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,520
post things on Google plus that only our listeners could see.

819
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,520
So if we ever wanted to do like a secret club, we could post it on Google plus cause it wouldn't

820
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,560
be public.

821
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,040
So follow us on Google plus, put us in your circles over there.

822
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,720
And uh, if any juicy gossip comes up, you know, in the next couple of months we will

823
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:35,020
post it so that only the followers in our circles can see kind of like online only secret

824
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,020
club.

825
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,840
There's uh, information about the show and pictures and all that stuff.

826
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,600
Uh, it's hard for me to give a URL to Google plus cause you can't have names yet, but just

827
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
search for us.

828
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Just type orange launch radio.

829
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
We'll come right up.

830
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
It's very easy to find.

831
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,640
I'm sure somebody will link it in chat here in a minute.

832
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,480
Uh, that's really it for housekeeping.

833
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,720
So let's get into some news.

834
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
Loki.

835
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:03,380
So, um, you may remember DC universe, uh, online went free to play last week and already

836
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,720
they've seen a huge increase in subscribers.

837
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,720
No duh.

838
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:14,280
Um, there are already up to a million subscribers and a million new players actually, and that's

839
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,240
basically a 1000% increase.

840
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,480
That's what happens when the game is free.

841
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,160
Um, I'm kind of curious though, wonder how many of those are actually paying for parts

842
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,040
of the game or just, you know, kind of like, you know, how I would probably be, would just

843
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,600
say, I might want to try that out.

844
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,040
Well, from what I understand, you can get upgrades to the game for only five bucks.

845
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,080
Like there's two different levels.

846
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,080
There's one where you can pay like a monthly fee and get all the good stuff.

847
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,280
And then there's one where you just pay five bucks and you get a lot of little upgrades.

848
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,680
That's kind of neat, I guess.

849
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,680
That's not bad.

850
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
That's not bad at all.

851
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,040
Um, I actually watched a friend play DC universe on PS three and it's, it's kind of what I

852
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,800
remember from the beta on PC.

853
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,320
I don't know if it's, I just, I don't have the fucking time for another MMO right now

854
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,120
with all the games out right now.

855
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:04,240
Like, did you notice that none of us mentioned modern warfare three, like the biggest release

856
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,000
effort in our gaming weeks at hall?

857
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,400
Uh, not that that's the type of game I would usually play anyway, but I, I'm curious, like

858
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:18,200
what makes this game so like, you know, desirable by so many people like the death match.

859
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,760
Well, speaking of multiplayer, I would actually like to check out the, the halo anniversary

860
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
edition at some point.

861
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,920
I do like original OG halo.

862
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,560
I'd like to check that out at some point.

863
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,920
Um, I would like to play Mario three d land Mario kart seven.

864
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,400
I don't know if you heard about the halo thing.

865
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,600
You know, all those connect features are talking about.

866
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Yeah.

867
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Yeah.

868
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Not at lunch.

869
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,800
They, they apparently are having trouble making them work.

870
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm like, really?

871
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,460
You were having trouble making, you know, a voice command to change the resolution from

872
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:52,120
original to like the new graphics or whatever, and also a voice command to throw a grenade.

873
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,240
You couldn't make that work at all.

874
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
Yeah.

875
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
Grenade grenade.

876
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Damn it.

877
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,240
It just, it doesn't understand certain accents.

878
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,040
It's like, like you're saying grenade grenade.

879
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,480
Did you say lemonade?

880
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,360
Here's a fresh glass of lemonade.

881
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
No grenade.

882
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,820
Uh, yeah.

883
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,240
So um, well I guess that that's good.

884
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,400
Maybe some other MMOs Final Fantasy 14 should, uh, follow suit with that.

885
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,920
Um, yeah, I think it's going to have to, I'm already over Final Fantasy 14.

886
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,080
I haven't touched it in like two weeks.

887
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:36,720
Well Final Fantasy 14 doesn't officially launch until I would like to see the whole 2.0, at

888
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,960
least DC universe didn't have to launch a 2.0 you're just getting the game that everybody

889
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,440
wanted to play, but no one wanted to pay 60 bucks and a monthly fee to play.

890
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
I mean, no shit.

891
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,400
They got a million people because like tons of people wanted to play this game, but they

892
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,520
were like, I'm not going to pay that kind of money for it.

893
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,640
There's only, there are so few games that can get away with charging what they do, especially

894
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,000
in this day of 99 cent iPhone apps.

895
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's crazy.

896
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
All right.

897
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,520
Well, I don't know how much they'll charge for this, but they could probably charge quite

898
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,680
a bit and many people would still buy this to reminisce the past.

899
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,600
The Simpsons arcade game has been classified in Australia.

900
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:21,060
What that means is that the rating has actually shown up on the Australian classification

901
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,600
board's website.

902
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,400
So it seems to indicate that the Simpsons arcade game could be on its way to Xbox live

903
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,760
arcade and PlayStation network because backbone is the one that is, I guess, registered the

904
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,880
game backbone entertainment.

905
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,720
They do a lot of the like classic games stuff.

906
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,880
One of the more recent ones they did was the X-Men arcade port, and it is saying it's published

907
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,080
by Konami.

908
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,680
So I don't know how that all works because I thought EA had the license, but maybe some

909
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,440
agreement was reached after all, when the Ninja turtles arcade game came out, they did

910
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
have a mutual agreement there.

911
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,220
So maybe something's been worked out.

912
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:00,360
So we may be getting the Simpsons arcade game on Xbox live arcade very soon, which fuck yes

913
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
to that.

914
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,200
That was one of my favorite arcade games back in the day.

915
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,440
I want to say we did a listless sometime ago about like Xbox live arcade game they most

916
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,720
need and that was on it.

917
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,560
So heck yeah, that'd be awesome.

918
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,880
I hope they didn't screw it up, but if it's like the X-Men arcade port, I think it'll

919
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,880
be fine.

920
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,800
And some of the other stuff they've done has been all right.

921
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,680
So, all right, Dark Sakura.

922
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,080
Actually I was checking the mailbox again to make sure we actually had something this

923
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,360
time.

924
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,360
We do.

925
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,360
Hooray.

926
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:34,000
So it's been going around, people have been talking about it, about the security breach

927
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
with Valve.

928
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,640
Valve actually did acknowledge that user's personal information had been compromised.

929
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,780
There was a security breach.

930
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:49,840
They said that they accessed a Steam database in addition to the forums.

931
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,700
That user names, passwords, game purchases, email address, billing addresses, credit card

932
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,300
information.

933
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,760
They don't have evidence that credit card information or personal identification was

934
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,280
taken or that the protection on them was cracked.

935
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,400
They're still trying to get into that.

936
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,040
But they said, watch your stuff very closely, which is why the only thing that's remotely

937
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,000
linked on my Steam account is that I use PayPal.

938
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That's it.

939
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Well, lucky you, but yeah, my credit card of course was on Steam.

940
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Go figure.

941
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,760
Actually, I don't think the new one is because mine lapsed during the year and I'm not sure

942
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
I ever put the new one on.

943
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,680
I don't really buy a lot of stuff on Steam and when I do, I just get it through PayPal.

944
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,600
I buy tons on Steam.

945
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:44,500
But yeah, I don't know, like you think I'd be more pissed off about this because of what

946
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:51,560
happened with Sony, but I don't know, there's a certain trust you kind of have with Valve

947
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,520
because they get so much other stuff and I kind of feel like they're being a little more

948
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,480
upfront with this than maybe necessarily Sony was.

949
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,200
And I do feel like a lot of the data was probably encrypted pretty well.

950
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,680
So I don't know.

951
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,760
Well here's a statement from Newell.

952
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,560
We do not know of any compromised Steam accounts, so we are not planning to force a change of

953
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,280
Steam account passwords, which are separate from the forum passwords.

954
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,240
However, it wouldn't be a bad idea to change that as well, especially if it's the same

955
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,480
as your Steam forum account password.

956
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,800
So I think mine are different.

957
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:33,560
I think also at the end of the day, the fault of this is not Valve's fault.

958
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,300
It's the hacker's fault.

959
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,140
You know, I don't know what Valve did to necessarily provoke this besides maybe Gabe Newell getting

960
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,520
up there at GDC and saying, you know, that it was unhackable and kind of daring people

961
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,760
to do it at some point.

962
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,800
I don't think that he would do that.

963
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,720
But it was, and it wasn't quite the way I'm saying it either.

964
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,120
He was just kind of showing about the security protection and all that, the Steam guard and

965
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,480
all that.

966
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,360
But at the end of the day, these guys weren't in there to steal games and maybe they didn't

967
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,100
steal the credit card information.

968
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,840
You know, I think Valve is just being very upfront that, hey, that information was at

969
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,840
risk.

970
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:12,520
And I don't know, the PlayStation network kind of felt like a Benny Hill show from the

971
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,520
beginning.

972
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,200
You know, just, it was one person tripping over another from there.

973
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,940
But I mean, obviously I'm not like, I'm a little bit upset and I'd like to kind of see

974
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:27,580
what Valve is going to do to make sure that my information doesn't stay at risk.

975
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,440
You know, I want to hear more constant updates about what they do, find out about what was

976
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,680
taken and not.

977
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,240
And if they do suspect that credit card information was taken, then they need to offer a lot of

978
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,480
the same services, like the debits and all that, that, that a PlayStation was offering.

979
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,480
But I don't know.

980
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,720
I kind of trust them to do a better job with their PR than I do Sony.

981
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,400
At the end of the day, no one ever had money taken from them on Sony either.

982
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:58,520
So, and hopefully nobody has money taken from them on Valve either, uh, chat.orangelauntrader.com.

983
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,240
Some of the comments, uh, salacious pop says the credit card info they got as hashed and

984
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,640
encrypted as shit.

985
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,120
So they'd have to crack that to do anything.

986
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,200
Also steam only lets you store one card on and it's very easy to delete it.

987
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,760
Uh, act theft says steam only saves the last card you used.

988
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,560
Um, game guru says valve is how you are supposed to address being hacked.

989
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,720
Uh, dark Tetsuya says I did change my password, even though I didn't really have any credit

990
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,880
card info on it, just at a habit for this sort of thing.

991
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,640
And that's a really good habit to have.

992
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,280
And if you haven't changed your steam password, you probably just should.

993
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,960
What what's, what's to lose from doing it.

994
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,420
Nobody's ever given me a good reason why you shouldn't change your password besides I can't

995
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,160
keep track of all those different passwords.

996
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,320
Well that's, you're, you're going to have to come up with a better excuse than that

997
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,440
in this day and age.

998
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,440
You know what I mean?

999
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,380
Um, Kaijuto has a very good point though.

1000
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,760
Just because valve is run by nerds doesn't mean they're hack proof.

1001
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,880
Nothing is.

1002
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,680
And game guru also puts this pretty clear here.

1003
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,160
People's been clear and up front, Sony tried to hide everything.

1004
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,160
That's true too.

1005
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,880
I do seem to remember that Sony, you know, the network was still up for a few days after

1006
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,880
and then it was just, it was, it was bad.

1007
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,680
Chat dot orange dot orange radio dot com is the place where those comments are coming

1008
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,680
from right now.

1009
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,280
Cause we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1010
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,420
Uh, Khasan in our chat room, K-H-A-S-N says I need to check my credit card transactions.

1011
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,480
That's all, that's just a good thing to do anyway.

1012
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,960
Like yeah, this should motivate you to do that, but just, I think check them at least

1013
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,720
once a week, if not like three times a week.

1014
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,480
I check my bank account every day.

1015
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,680
Just a, I like to know how much money's in there cause who actually balances a checkbook

1016
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,680
anymore?

1017
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,560
And b, I just like to see that all the transactions that are going through are things that I actually

1018
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,560
initiated.

1019
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:47,040
Well, um, I, before the show I checked my, uh, PayPal just to be sure.

1020
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,520
And of course there's nothing cause I'm broke.

1021
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,520
That's good.

1022
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,520
That's what you want to see.

1023
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,360
But yeah, I mean the last thing on there was last month when I bought the, uh, the Humble

1024
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,360
Indie bundle.

1025
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,360
Ah.

1026
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,360
That was it.

1027
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,360
Nice.

1028
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
All right.

1029
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,360
All right.

1030
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,560
Well hopefully we'll get more information on that in the weeks to come as to who did

1031
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
it.

1032
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,680
Hang them up by their balls.

1033
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,680
Who done it?

1034
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,680
Who done it?

1035
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,320
It was Ms. Scarlet in the conservatory.

1036
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,620
Um, and of course, you know, steam isn't the only thing to get hacked this week.

1037
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:22,280
Also the My Resistance website, the official website for the game Resistance, um, from

1038
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,560
Sony got, uh, hacked as well and their forums are down as well.

1039
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:34,240
Um, and basically, you know, the, there's no, uh, it hasn't been immediately verified

1040
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,520
by Insomniac or Sony, um, whether anything was done.

1041
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,000
I don't think anything's really compromised other than these people's usernames and passwords

1042
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,640
and maybe emails because, you know, you don't store credit card information on this website.

1043
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,120
So, um, basically, uh, yeah, it sucks.

1044
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,120
Hackers are gonna hack.

1045
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,800
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1046
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,200
We have said that before.

1047
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,400
What did, what do they get from this besides, cause there's no like, it's not like they

1048
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,480
have credit cards on the Resistance site or anything like that, right?

1049
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,840
Um, I think what they could be doing is they could be harvesting usernames and passwords,

1050
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,240
maybe emails and stuff to try to run those against, you know, logins on the PlayStation

1051
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,240
network.

1052
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,880
You know, to see if any of those people have the same username, password, login info that

1053
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,080
they would on both of those.

1054
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:32,640
Um, I don't know if maybe there's a way to link your account to, um, that site or something.

1055
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,560
I don't think you'd have to put your password in though for that, but my, my guess is just,

1056
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,160
it's mainly just to find username password combos that they can try at a bunch of different

1057
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,520
websites and see if people are using the same things and maybe get access to accounts that

1058
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,520
way.

1059
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,000
All right.

1060
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,560
Well, more hacking stories on the Xbox.

1061
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,840
Hackings are still kind of slowly bubbling through the press and so forth.

1062
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,860
And I've addressed this on a show before.

1063
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,640
If you forgot, I had 150 bucks stolen from my Xbox back in August.

1064
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,560
It was about August 14th, 15th or so that that was happened.

1065
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,280
And I basically lost access to my Xbox for a month while they were investigating and

1066
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,280
finally got my money back.

1067
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,840
I think it was about 28 days after the incident had happened.

1068
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,040
Uh, so I was out 150 bucks for 28 days and that's not something I know everybody can

1069
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,040
afford to do.

1070
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,680
Um, so you gotta be very careful.

1071
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:28,120
Um, Microsoft refuses that anything is going on, but I know at least 10 individuals that

1072
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,120
this has happened to.

1073
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,400
I am not making that number up.

1074
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,880
Granted, I have a lot of Facebook friends and people on Twitter, but I know at least

1075
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,880
10.

1076
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,760
And then I still have people telling me like friends of friends and so forth.

1077
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,260
So I know that doesn't seem like a very large number, but considering I know people all

1078
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:47,440
through the spectrum from people who play games all the time, every day to people that

1079
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,040
hadn't touched their account in one to two years.

1080
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,440
That tells me that something's going on.

1081
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,980
And this shit made me angry this week is I saw that there was a report on Eurogamer.

1082
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,100
I'm not mad at Eurogamer.

1083
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,100
They're just reporting it.

1084
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,100
Don't shoot the messenger.

1085
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,100
Right.

1086
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,520
And apparently Microsoft is claiming that all these FIFA ultimate team pack purchases

1087
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,520
that are the, uh, quote hacks going on.

1088
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,300
Microsoft is claiming in an interview with Eurogamer from online safety director Doug

1089
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,300
Park.

1090
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,620
It is not a hack that it is some type of quote new attack vector quote.

1091
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,720
It's not a hack.

1092
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,120
It's really just a different way to monetize stolen accounts.

1093
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,240
What any service has compromises.

1094
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,760
Facebook has compromises.

1095
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,280
Wow has compromises.

1096
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,420
What they're really doing is trying to make money off those compromises.

1097
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,520
So FIFA is a very popular title.

1098
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,840
It's just a new way for the bad guys to make money.

1099
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,700
It wasn't based on our investigation.

1100
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,800
We didn't see anything new.

1101
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,760
It was just a different Avenue.

1102
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,720
I'm not getting into super detail, but there is basics of account compromise.

1103
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,480
There's phishing, there's social engineering, there's malware based off the industry today.

1104
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,000
Most of it comes off malware and phishing.

1105
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,040
If they get the accounts, they sell it.

1106
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,120
That's really all they were doing, whether it's FIFA or an account with a PlayStation

1107
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,700
subscription or an account with a live subscription.

1108
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,840
It's all basically the same thing.

1109
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,420
So basically he's deflecting.

1110
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:10,980
He's refusing to accept that anything's going wrong at Xbox and you, sir, are lying.

1111
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,920
You may not know you're lying, but I'm here to tell you that these claims that this is

1112
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:19,320
all like phishing and all this stuff, you're full of crap.

1113
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:23,720
Wake up because something deeper is going on here and it has to do with Xbox and it

1114
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:28,260
has to do with EA because I will poke a hole in this right now.

1115
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:33,120
The people that are getting hacked, it's not just FIFA, dun dun dun.

1116
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,040
It's other EA games.

1117
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,740
I know somebody that got money stolen out of Madden.

1118
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:42,600
I know somebody where the first person that they are, the first game that they went into

1119
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:48,720
to go play on it was, um, it was also actually was also Madden in that case, but it's other

1120
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,360
EA sports games.

1121
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,640
Look for a class action.

1122
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,520
It's not just FIFA, although that seems to be the most popular one because that's where

1123
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,200
they can take the big chunk of money and I guess probably monetize something, but it's

1124
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,400
happening through other games.

1125
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,140
But guess what?

1126
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:06,360
They're all EA games.

1127
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:13,040
Can anyone show me, can anyone show me a game that is that are an Xbox hack that's going

1128
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,400
on that did not somehow involve an EA product?

1129
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,400
Can anyone show that?

1130
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,960
That orange knowledge radio.com twitter.com slash O L R is anyone that's been impacted

1131
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,800
where there more money has been taken out of the account was an EA game not involved

1132
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:35,520
because I'll tell you what I think I know the link and the link is I believe that the

1133
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:42,680
people that are getting hacked are people that do not play EA sports games.

1134
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:48,880
I've never played an EA sports game on Xbox live save for, um, uh, the burnout paradise,

1135
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,520
which did not have the EA network.

1136
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,840
Um, some of the other, you know, like rock band, which isn't a part of that new EA network

1137
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,240
and all that other people that I know that have been hacked do not play EA sports games

1138
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:04,640
online or they have not played their Xbox in several years.

1139
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:13,560
If you do not have your Xbox account tied to the new EA system, you are vulnerable.

1140
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,680
I believe that I don't have any proof, but trending that I see.

1141
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,840
So I'm just some shmo on a podcast, putting that out there, whatever, take it or leave

1142
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,840
it.

1143
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,680
But I'm telling you, I think if you want to best protect yourself, one thing that you

1144
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,880
should do right now, well, in addition to change your password, which I've told you

1145
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,340
5,000 times to do, and if you haven't done it by now, I don't know what to tell you,

1146
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:40,720
but I think what you should do go download the demo for either NBA jam on fire or need

1147
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,480
for speed, the run, which granted wasn't a bad demo.

1148
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,760
When you play those demos, you're going to have to create an EA account to get onto those

1149
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,960
servers.

1150
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,000
And now you'll establish a link between your Xbox and your EA account, because I'm telling

1151
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:00,740
you, when I got hacked, they linked a fake account up and somehow there's some vulnerability

1152
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,320
there that neither Microsoft nor EA will admit.

1153
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,560
But I'm telling you, there's too much of a trend here for me to ignore.

1154
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,400
As a gamer, as somebody who doesn't want the fans of this show to lose money, I'm just

1155
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,360
telling you, what I'm seeing in all these other cases are people that have not linked

1156
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,800
the EA account through some type of sports title are the ones that are being hacked.

1157
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,200
I don't know how they're doing it, but that's the common denominator, dammit.

1158
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,100
At the very least, going ahead and associating it with an account would prevent the whatever

1159
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,680
exploit there might be from being used.

1160
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,560
I don't think it's necessarily that they're not getting hacked, it's just that they're

1161
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:38,000
not buying anything with it, because once they find out, oh, well, I can't get access

1162
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,700
to the EA thing, then, well, not much I can do there.

1163
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:47,000
And I don't know, I'm kind of irritated that this bozo would go out there and say that

1164
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,960
we're all being phished.

1165
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,960
Because he's wrong.

1166
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,800
I know somebody that hadn't touched their Xbox in two years.

1167
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,520
Like I'm supposed to believe that guy somehow got phished?

1168
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,960
Oh, I haven't played my Xbox in two years, but shit, I'm gonna log onto this website

1169
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,160
and just give them my Xbox login.

1170
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,200
Really?

1171
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,960
I'd like to think I'm somewhat smarter than that, too.

1172
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:15,760
I mean, I'd like to think, I mean, I'm not gonna be all Sony, big in the head about it,

1173
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:21,120
that I am penetratable when it comes to getting, you know, my information phished or whatever,

1174
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:25,640
but I'd like to think, I always think twice about links I click on and websites I'm visiting

1175
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,260
and make sure the websites are genuine.

1176
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,720
So if this guy's gonna come out and say that I'm getting phished, you better be ready to

1177
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,560
throw down, because you might be wrong.

1178
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:42,400
And if you're wrong, I'm gonna be double mad.

1179
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,360
Fifth dream in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrader.com says you'd be amazed how many people don't

1180
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:52,140
know the password that their email address associated with their Xbox Live accounts.

1181
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,140
Get it reset.

1182
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,280
You gotta do something.

1183
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,000
Take control of that, especially if you have a credit card tied to it.

1184
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,200
They're getting in there somehow.

1185
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,920
I don't know what they're doing.

1186
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,980
I don't know how they're doing it.

1187
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,880
If we knew, it would be all over the gaming media, but nobody can figure out how they're

1188
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,880
doing it.

1189
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:13,560
And Microsoft won't admit that there's a problem, because somehow they're both being used.

1190
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,860
Microsoft and EA.

1191
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:19,040
And I don't, I can't figure out how.

1192
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,680
Somebody's gonna figure it out, though.

1193
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:27,560
Honestly, I think they should start looking into their password reset system.

1194
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,840
I wanna say one more thing about this, because this is the other thing.

1195
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,880
This guy is deflecting, because he tries to throw all these other companies under the

1196
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,880
bus.

1197
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,040
And he says, any service has compromises.

1198
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,960
WOW has compromises.

1199
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,360
Okay, true point.

1200
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,120
I've also had my WOW account hacked.

1201
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,960
I think I know how that happened, and I do think that was phishing.

1202
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,560
I think I used, I logged into a computer that I shouldn't have logged into WOW in.

1203
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,760
So, okay, fair enough.

1204
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,160
Again, I said earlier, I'm not perfect, it can't happen, okay?

1205
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:01,160
But there's a big difference between what WOW is doing and what Microsoft's doing.

1206
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:05,360
Blizzard will openly admit that your accounts are vulnerable to theft, that people will

1207
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,000
try and steal your Xbox accounts.

1208
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,280
Blizzard will sell an authenticator, so that you can get into your accounts, and try to

1209
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,760
bring incentives for you to use those authenticators, like free pets and so forth.

1210
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,480
They've come up with new ways of authentication, like authenticating by phone.

1211
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,440
They are constantly trying to change the security in their system.

1212
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,840
What are you doing, Microsoft?

1213
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:30,140
Oh, we're watching the situation very closely.

1214
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,360
On top of that, they give away the authenticator for free, and the only thing that you have

1215
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,360
to pay for is if you buy a physical authenticator.

1216
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,200
That's true, they have the mobile phone authenticator for free.

1217
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,200
Which is what I use.

1218
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,840
That's very true, good point.

1219
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,760
Microsoft doesn't have anything like that.

1220
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,160
Microsoft doesn't tell people to change their passwords regularly.

1221
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,440
Microsoft won't admit that there's people out there trying to steal money from your

1222
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,440
account.

1223
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,680
At least if they're doing it, I'm sure they would come back and say, well, Robin is right

1224
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,680
here on the website.

1225
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,680
Okay, on some page, people never look at it, and the font size is not big enough, anyone

1226
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,680
can see it.

1227
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:05,820
It is right there on the login screen, as you're waiting for the game to load, on wow.

1228
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,340
Protect your account from theft.

1229
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:12,500
Do A, B, and C. That's the level of stuff that Microsoft needs to do, because accounts

1230
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:18,560
are being stolen, and it's not just because we're all stupid when it comes to learning

1231
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,560
the internet.

1232
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,440
Anyhow, I've ranted enough, sorry.

1233
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,560
But it just irritates me.

1234
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:33,240
This is such corporate, you know, just talking out his butt, and it irritates me the more

1235
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,240
Microsoft tries to deny that anything is wrong.

1236
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,720
You know what another term for talking out of your butt is?

1237
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,720
Farting?

1238
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,720
Furthermore.

1239
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,720
Or shit.

1240
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,720
I said I was dumb, but I'm not.

1241
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,480
Furthermore, maybe it would irritate, I know, I'm a total liar.

1242
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,760
Dan's in the other room, one liar.

1243
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,420
It would irritate me a lot less if that, you know, the other part of this is that I was

1244
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:58,780
locked out of my Xbox account for 28 days.

1245
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:02,480
How long was I out of my wow account when I got hacked?

1246
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,480
A day?

1247
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,480
An hour.

1248
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,480
Okay.

1249
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,980
Fix it, Microsoft.

1250
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,800
And have better font.

1251
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,800
Moving on.

1252
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Okay.

1253
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,720
Well, one good thing that they're doing, though, is that Xbox.com lets you cancel your auto

1254
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,320
renewal for Xbox Live.

1255
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:26,680
There is a toggle that you can turn on or off, and instead of them automatically renewing,

1256
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:32,400
if you turn it off, then they won't renew, clearly.

1257
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:39,960
There's actually, there's also the beacons functionality added in, so that you can say

1258
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,120
which games you would like to play with other people, and that's actually on Xbox Live now.

1259
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:52,400
New messaging, new browsing, new searching for films and TV, that type of thing.

1260
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:57,200
And they have a new interface that goes with the Metro UI theme.

1261
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:05,840
So I guess that's cool, but honestly, it's not enough, but it's something.

1262
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:10,680
Well, it's better than what was there before, which was still having to call support and

1263
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,680
all that stuff.

1264
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:16,600
But by the way, just to throw it out there, certain other subscription things, you cannot

1265
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,300
cancel online as easily still.

1266
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,720
So although it may make it sound like there's certain things...

1267
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,960
And by the way, I tried to go in.

1268
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,040
The first thing I tried to do, not only did Microsoft...

1269
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,040
Oh, God.

1270
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,640
I was so mad at them lately.

1271
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,440
Not only did Microsoft automatically update my credit card info.

1272
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,440
Like I don't know what they did.

1273
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,380
Did they guess the new expiration date?

1274
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:40,480
I don't know how they did it, but they automatically updated my credit card information.

1275
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,640
I can't remove it.

1276
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,620
You can't remove your credit card on the website.

1277
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:51,160
You try to click remove and it goes, you cannot remove this card because you are currently

1278
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:57,080
using this card to pay for your one month card of Xbox Live.

1279
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1280
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:05,680
I can't remove my credit card because I'm using it to fund a prepaid Xbox Live card?

1281
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,360
No, that's when you report it to the Better Business Bureau.

1282
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,360
Ridiculous.

1283
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,400
But Rob, you're paying for the free card.

1284
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,400
Enough smoke and mirrors.

1285
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,400
What?

1286
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,400
I said, but you're paying for the free card.

1287
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,520
That's hilarious.

1288
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:29,280
I mean, not in a funny way, but just I was like, seriously, you guys are going to go

1289
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,280
that far?

1290
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:36,960
So much smoke and mirrors from Microsoft to the point where like I am I am seriously considering

1291
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,160
the next console.

1292
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,660
Somebody called me out on Twitter, too, about it, which is fine.

1293
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,660
That's fine.

1294
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,660
You know, I have an opinion.

1295
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:45,760
If you think there's there's a problem with it, then whatever.

1296
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,240
But somebody had said, wait, you are mad at Microsoft when PlayStation was the one that

1297
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,160
opened it got hacked and all that.

1298
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,160
Fair point.

1299
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:59,000
But still, has anyone presented a case where somebody actually had money stole them stolen

1300
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,880
from them from PlayStation?

1301
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,880
Has anyone been able to prove that?

1302
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:09,080
Because I could prove to you about 10 different cases of money being stolen, many, many more.

1303
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,660
If you look at the Web forums that are out there on Xbox.

1304
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,960
Why are we all mad at Sony again?

1305
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:24,160
Because of the potential loss, the potential, Rob, we're going to be mad at Sony, be mad

1306
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:29,280
at Sony about, you know, them bumble fucking tripping over their own feet and handling

1307
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,600
the situation.

1308
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,120
I'm just saying Microsoft's really no better.

1309
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,560
Well, this is their M.O.

1310
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,960
I mean, look at what they do with the red ring systems and stuff like that.

1311
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,080
Oh, it was a small percentage.

1312
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:47,200
I was like one percent and definitely not 100 percent or 50 or whatever.

1313
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,280
So just flip it.

1314
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,280
That's all I'm saying.

1315
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,320
The folks that are saying that flip it.

1316
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,320
Why?

1317
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:58,200
Why do you get why do you give Microsoft to pass all the time?

1318
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,360
Let's be equally critical of all the game companies.

1319
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,360
We should.

1320
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,360
Nintendo, why aren't you?

1321
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:08,200
Well, we should give them hundreds of dollars, which we do.

1322
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:12,520
I have a right to be critical of a company I'm giving hundreds of dollars to.

1323
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,920
That holds my credit card hostage.

1324
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,120
But anyway, let's move on release dates.

1325
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,120
Yes.

1326
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,120
I love video games.

1327
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,120
I do.

1328
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,400
But just some of this some of this stuff I could do without continuing on with the plethora

1329
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:33,600
of releases coming out, of course, today with Super Mario 3D Land for the 3DS Carnival Games

1332
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,900
It's like that one game that they have on the PlayStation Network.

1333
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:50,440
It's like a side scroller Kung Fu game that uses the Kinect camera.

1334
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:55,160
L.A. Noire The Complete Edition on PC this week.

01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,440
Oh yay!

1346
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,440

That's right, you can get U-Draw now on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well.

1357

01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:38,840
get U-Draw Instant Artist if you already have the U-Draw tablet on the Wii as a standalone

1359
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,840

what you do in this game.

01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,400

01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,160
It's the last big one.

1384
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:02,840
Well, next week actually you're still gonna have a few things, but this is the last big

That's only 70 bucks?

1414
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,280
That's not bad at all.

1415
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:00,440
Well, it's Xbox 360 and you only get the guitar with, I thought it had the game in there.

1416
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,440
It's not the game.

1417
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,440
I get it.

1418
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,880

So, that's it.

1422
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,920

Well, let's go to Japan and check out the releases over there.

1424
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,960
It's a very busy week over in Japan as well.

1425
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,720
These releases are for November 17th.

1426
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:31,400

1429
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:48,720
out as well as some type of Modern Warfare 3 themed Xbox Live card, because as far as

1430
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:52,100
I'm concerned, you should be doing all of your Microsoft transactions right now with

1431
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,200
cards only.

1432
01:10:54,200 --> 01:11:01,840
There is also a game coming out called Naorihon no Mago Hyaki Rairaran Taisen that comes out

1433
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,720
this week from Konami.

1434
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,640
This looks like...I'm trying to figure out what game this is.

1435
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,920
I don't know if it's based on an anime.

1436
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,420
It is a fighting game that's coming out.

1437
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:17,980
From the strongest team to defeat the Harugomo Kitsune, that powerful fox spirit has been

1438
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:24,200
devouring people and usurping power since the Heian era, and Riko, the leader of Hakai

1439
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,600
Yayo, the March of 100 Ogres, is the one to defeat her.

1440
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:34,100
So it's a fighting game on the 360 that I am not familiar with on this side of the pond.

1441
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:40,200
Going to the PlayStation 3, Call of Duty in subtitles there as well, Ninokuni Shiroki

1442
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,800
Seihai no Juu comes out from level 5 this week.

1443
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,800
This is a...oh, it's the Studio Ghibli game on PlayStation 3.

1444
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,200
That looks like it could be very impressive, actually.

1445
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,720
That looks...ooh, it's all cartoony.

1446
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,720
That game's very cute.

1447
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,720
Let me look.

1448
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,720
Wait, wait.

1449
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,720
Go back.

1450
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,720
Look at that.

1451
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,600
This is the Studio Ghibli on PlayStation 3.

1452
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,960
That's cute.

1453
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:03,960
Yeah.

1454
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:07,080
That looks like it would be worth importing.

1455
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,840
It is Ninokunai.

1456
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,680
It's a magical land on PlayStation 3.

1457
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,360
The orphan Oliver is determined to save his mother, who died to save him.

1458
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:21,640
In order to do so, he followed Shizuku, the fairy of the tears, into the world of Ninokuni

1459
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,320
to defeat the evil magician Jabo.

1460
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,320
Huh.

1461
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,320
Ninokuni.

1462
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,320
Huh.

1463
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,120
Good times.

1464
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,520
That fighting game I spoke of earlier is out on the PlayStation 3 as well, and there is

1465
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:39,000
a whole PlayStation 3 bundle, because they love the different bundles there in Japan.

1466
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,040
There's a whole bundle around that Ghibli game, so that's gonna be fun.

1467
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:47,760
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 there as well, as well as The Sims 3 Pets and Saints Row the Third,

1468
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,920
all on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

1469
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:57,760
Going to the PSP, Angelique Mareno Rokukishi comes out this week, as well as Uminico no

1470
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:03,880
Naku Koro ni Portable 2 from Alchemist.

1471
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,620
Trying to see if that's a game I recognize.

1472
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:08,640
It's chapters 3 and 4 of an ongoing series.

1473
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,520
That is out on the PSP this week.

1474
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:17,720
Lastly, cleaning up on the Wii and the 3DS, nothing on the Wii this week, because, you

1475
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,680
know, Wii releases are kind of dying.

1476
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:25,600
Same is true in Japan, but on the 3DS this week, Shinobi 3D and The Sims 3 Pets.

1477
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,200
That's your Japanese releases.

1478
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,440
Dark Sakura.

1479
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:33,320
In Europe on the 15th, we have, well, this is UK, Assassin's Creed Revelations, I, Pet

01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:40,480

And then we have on the 18th, Anno 2070, Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7, Marathon, Need for

1484
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,080
Sit.

1485
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,300
Busy, busy.

1486
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:06,560
In our chatroom, by the way, they are talking about Ni No Kuni, which I had mentioned before,

1487
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,560
the Studio Ghibli game.

1488
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:11,600
They are saying, some folks, AlphaKananagram says, they did say that it's coming to North

1489
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,600
America, I think.

1490
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,640
And Dark Tetsuya says, I thought it was coming out over here.

1491
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,200
Yeah, it probably is, but not this week.

1492
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,500
Japan's getting it first.

1493
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:22,000
If we're getting it, what, summer next year, maybe?

1494
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Spring.

1495
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Spring.

1496
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Oh, you looked it up, huh?

1497
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
No.

1498
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I just know.

1499
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Oh.

1500
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Well.

1501
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
So we are getting it.

1502
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
It's just, you know, gonna take a little time for the translation.

1503
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Yeah.

1504
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,680
We're gonna do a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of

1505
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,680
the week.

1506
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,680
But first.

1507
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:43,680
Well, everyone's been wondering with the Vita, is there gonna be a way for me to import my

1508
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:47,920
games that I may have on UMD to the Vita?

1509
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,960
And the answer is yes.

1510
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,720
There is actually a way to do that.

1511
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:56,320
And it's not free, but it's a discount.

1512
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,200
So I guess that's better than nothing.

1513
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,680
Basically, what you do is you take your existing PSP.

1514
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:06,240
You pop in the UMD that you want to register.

1515
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:09,880
And it will register on the website, I guess, or on their service.

1516
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,280
And you'll be able to download the game at a small fee.

1517
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,120
And of course, they haven't announced prices over here yet, since the Vita's still a ways

1518
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,120
away.

1519
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:25,000
But in Japan, it ranges between an average of 500 and 1000 yen.

1520
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,320
So it's not bad.

1521
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,280
That's a pretty good compromise, I think.

1522
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:36,720
And you know, really, if you want to abuse that, you could take a friend's UMD or rent

1523
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,920
a UMD or something like that, pop it in their register like you own it.

1524
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,360
I mean, there's no way for them to know, but at least you get a little bit of a discount

1525
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,880
if you're planning on actually buying the game anyways.

1526
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,240
I still don't like the fact that I'm having to basically put in the UMD to have the privilege

1527
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,760
of paying for the game all over again.

1528
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,680
Well, I get it.

1529
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,680
It just sucks.

1530
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,600
I mean, the only reason they're doing that is because they know people are gonna abuse

1531
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,600
it.

1532
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,240
And because they can.

1533
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:07,000
And because really, just play it on your PSP then if you don't want to, you know, if you

1534
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,360
don't want to pay for it.

1535
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,360
I guess that's true.

1536
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:15,960
Still, wouldn't it be nice if they just had true backwards compatibility, but I guess

1537
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,000
you can't do that when you change formats.

1538
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:24,240
Anyhow, um, so it's gonna be backwards compatible, just obviously you can't, you know, well,

1539
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,240
it's not really though.

1540
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:30,000
Well, there's no UMD drive, big deal.

1541
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,520
That's an antiquated format.

1542
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,880
Alright, moving on.

1543
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,160
What about the digital copies of games I bought?

1544
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,200
I bought 30 Second Hero digitally.

1545
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,280
Will I be able to just download that to my Vita?

1546
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,280
Yes.

1547
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,280
Okay, then I'm fine.

1548
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,280
Then that's good.

1549
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,080
Yeah, all that stuff is tied to your network account and you can re-download it to that,

1550
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:51,440
but it's just UMD games, you know, there's no way to transfer that because they're not

1551
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,440
gonna make a UMD drive.

1552
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,120
I feel a little better then.

1553
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:59,840
Alright, moving on to information about Super Mario 3D Land, which was of course a big,

1554
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:04,120
release today, came out today, a lot of people very excited about that, um, I wanna pick

1555
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,920
this up at some point, amongst all the other games.

1556
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:13,480
Here's the thing, it is one of the games I wanna get for the 3DS, but I just don't see

1557
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:17,320
myself playing it anytime soon, and I'm in no big hurry, it's a Mario game, you know,

1558
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:20,880
I know it's gonna be good, but it's not like, I gotta rush out and go get it.

1559
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,880
I have been hearing a lot of good things about it, it's getting really good reviews, but

1560
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,040
it's getting lost amongst all the Modern Warfare and Skyrim chatter, but this is one for the

1561
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,000
younger crowd too, I mean, all ages really.

1562
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,560
It reminds me a lot of Mario Galaxy, but just in, you know, the 3DS.

1563
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,560
And that's not a bad thing?

1564
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,560
No, it's not a bad thing.

1565
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,560
Mario Galaxy's fucking great.

1566
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,160
But anyway, um, there is a help system in the game, a lot of the newer Nintendo games

1567
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,960
have kinda held your hand a little bit if you constantly fuck up, and Mario 3D Land

1568
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:44,960
is no different.

1569
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,540
Uh, it's been revealed through, you know, people playing the game today, that if you

1570
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:53,340
die twice, you'll get a free power-up at the beginning of the level, like a random power-up

1571
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,340
that happens.

1572
01:17:54,340 --> 01:18:00,200
And if you die five times in a level, you get a tanooki suit that's basically invincibility

1573
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,480
the whole way through the level.

1574
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:05,280
So it's like, you can't die unless you are just a baddie.

1575
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,380
Um, so it really will help you handle, I mean, can you imagine if the original Mario Brothers

1576
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,380
had did that?

1577
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:14,020
Like, oh, you're having problems beating World 8 too?

1578
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,600
You can't get through these hammer brothers?

1579
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,200
Here, have invincibility through the entire level.

1580
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,240
That's just why I saved P-Wings and flew over the whole damn thing.

1581
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,720
So that's, uh, you know, that's where we're at now.

1582
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,960
Now, here's the interesting thing though, is that you're only allowed to do that the

1583
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,080
first time you beat a level.

1584
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,860
If you're trying to go back and look for coins, be a completionist and so forth, you don't

1585
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,080
get help.

1586
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,480
So if you're gonna go collect coins and shit, you better do it the first time you have that

1587
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,460
tanooki suit, cause you won't be getting it again.

1588
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:46,280
So that's the help in Mario 3D.

1589
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:51,140
Anyhow, uh, what's all this, what's all this newfangled 3D stuff?

1590
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,420
You remember a time when gaming was simpler?

1591
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:57,220
We didn't have all this newfangled 3D Mario Galaxy.

1592
01:18:57,220 --> 01:19:02,240
No, we had Super Mario Brothers 2D.

1593
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,240
We liked it.

1594
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,480
We're gonna travel back to a simpler time where Dark Sakura's gonna get into the classic

1595
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:11,620
gaming vault and find a game that she says, hey, hey, I don't wanna hear about your Skyrim.

1596
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:15,460
I wanna hear about your Modern Warfare, your 3DSes.

1597
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:18,060
I don't know about your Skyrim job.

1598
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:21,200
Go play this game because this is classic gaming.

1599
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:25,020
I think that you should play the intro to the game.

1600
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:26,500
A lot of people are just gonna pick it up right now.

1601
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,500
They're gonna get it right away.

1602
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:31,400
All right, well then let's go right to the intro of this week's classic game of the week.

1603
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:42,240
This is an oldie goodie.

1604
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,820
Or maybe you were like five when this game came out.

1605
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,140
Well, I said rock on purpose.

1606
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:49,540
There have been a lot of hard listeners who were.

1607
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:58,660
It's Mega Man X, also known as Rockman X, which came out on Super Nintendo or also the

1608
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:05,580
Super Famicom in 1993 in Japan, 1994 in North America.

1609
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:08,180
There's PC versions, yay.

1610
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:12,860
But this is probably one of the best of the series.

1611
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:19,220
So it's like in the future Mega Man X was made by Dr. Light and stored away in a capsule

1612
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:22,060
for 30 years and Dr. Light probably died.

1613
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:29,260
So this other one named Dr. Cane finds him and, well, he made a bunch of robots based

1614
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:30,820
on X and they all went crazy.

1615
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:33,220
So basically X has to go stop him.

1616
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:36,340
We have zero in this game, it's awesome.

1617
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:44,100
So this is what really, I think, where the Mega Man games were really cool, you know,

1618
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,780
and I've always thought they were really awesome.

1619
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:53,500
I think though that having the X series really kind of launched it into the next level, if

1620
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:58,500
you'll pardon me for using the phrase.

1621
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:03,500
Anyway, as it went through there, we had more characters.

1622
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:10,340
Like I said, there was Zero who was brought in, there was Axl, Sigma, you know, as the

1623
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:13,180
bad guy.

1624
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:16,700
And then, so moving through, there were also, of course, later games.

1625
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:24,700
There was all the way up through Rockman, Mega Man X8, I think was the last part.

1626
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:30,700
Dan's gonna be the last one.

1627
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:37,260
That's what I meant, yeah, X8 was the last one.

1628
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:42,940
I had to be sure, well, I was pretty sure, but you know, we've also had different versions

1629
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:43,940
of them.

1630
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:50,680
There's been Mega Man Xtreme and Xtreme 2, which was in Japan, was called Rockman X Cyber

1631
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:56,740
Mission and Rocksman X2, Soul Eraser, which is just a freaking cool name, came out of

1632
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:57,740
them.

1633
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:05,660
And then, we've also had Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, which was the re-release for PSP.

1634
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:11,660
So I mean, basically, he's got different abilities apart from just, you know, the shooting and

1635
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:14,420
you kill the robot, you get the power, blah, blah, blah.

1636
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:18,980
He can also dash and you can get an air dash later on.

1637
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:21,360
Get all these power-ups.

1638
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:25,020
You can also charge your weapon too, which is really useful.

1639
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:31,420
That means you can also charge your, um, the weapons that you inherit from other Mavericks.

1640
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:33,100
So that's pretty cool.

1641
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:38,420
And um, they have interesting names, some of these Mavericks, like Toxic Seahorse.

1642
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:44,780
But they're pretty much element-based, you know, you get your fire, water, lightning,

1643
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:48,900
wind, magnetism, time, all kinds of stuff.

1644
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:53,480
So uh, really there's not much else, you know, I can really say about that because it's freaking

1645
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,420
Mega Man X and if you haven't played it, where have you been?

1646
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,420
Go play it!

1647
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:00,700
There's billions and billions of versions out there to try.

1648
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:04,500
Some comments from our chatroom at chat.ownersontrader.com, Hitstun says, actually I played this game

1649
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,180
on PC first.

1650
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:09,380
There was a PC demo that was just the intro stage until Sigma showed up, but I thought

1651
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:10,380
it was awesome.

1652
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:11,860
I do remember this game on PC, actually.

1653
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:12,860
Yeah.

1654
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:13,860
There was a PC port.

1655
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:16,940
There was an old-ass Mega Man game on PC that was really terrible, it was only like three

1656
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:17,940
stages.

1657
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:19,660
Anyway, but that's not X.

1658
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:22,180
But anyway, uh, let's see.

1659
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:26,900
Um, also I got schooled because I said earlier, remember I said back when we didn't have 3D

1660
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:27,900
games and all that?

1661
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,620
Act Def said we had 3D Rad Racer.

1662
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,980
Aww, I got burned.

1663
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:33,980
Burned total.

1664
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:34,980
I did.

1665
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,980
The shutter glasses that came out with the raster system.

1666
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:37,980
No, it was red-blue.

1667
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:38,980
Red-blue, oh yeah.

1668
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,980
No, but there was a lasaxon 3D.

1669
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:41,980
Yes.

1670
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:42,980
Yes.

1671
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:43,980
Yeah, the shutter glasses.

1672
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,540
Alright, so I guess we did have 3D gaming back then.

1673
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:46,540
I got told.

1674
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,660
Dude, what are you doing?

1675
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:48,980
Not really in the Super Nintendo era.

1676
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,260
Are you playing Saints Row?

1677
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,420
Loki is playing Saints Row with his dildo bat.

1678
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:55,500
Are you gonna hit somebody in the face with your dildo bat?

1679
01:23:55,500 --> 01:24:00,740
You just- Okay, this is terrible radio if I watch this.

1680
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:01,740
Good.

1681
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:02,740
It's floppy!

1682
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:05,020
He literally- Who wants a floppy dildo?

1683
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:09,660
He literally threw a guy to the ground and then posed like, hey, like a little swimsuit

1684
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:12,020
model pose on the guy.

1685
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:14,300
Who- Wow.

1686
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,340
What's the purpose of having a floppy dildo?

1687
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:20,300
You just kicked that fat guy in the crotch and then whapped him with your dildo.

1688
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:21,300
They kicked a woman.

1689
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:22,300
That was a woman.

1690
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,300
That was a woman.

1691
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,300
That was a pat.

1692
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,300
It was a pat.

1693
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,300
Alright.

1694
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:31,340
Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1695
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:32,980
Make a man X.

1696
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:34,220
Good pick, Dark Sakura.

1697
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:35,220
Good pick.

1698
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,220
I know.

1699
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:37,220
Thank you.

1700
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:38,220
Alright.

1701
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,220
We're gonna take a break, but don't go anywhere.

1702
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:42,220
Those of you on the podcast will only be gone like five seconds, but those of you live, don't

1703
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:45,080
go anywhere because we're gonna be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio.

1704
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:51,900
Your emails, which finally came through, phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, rapid fire news,

1705
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:56,260
talk of a Tumblr post that's taking everybody by storm, but I'm gonna be a bitch about it.

1706
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,340
So stay tuned for that.

1707
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:58,340
We'll be back.

1708
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,340
What's new?

1709
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:00,340
Shut up.

1710
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,340
We'll be back.

1711
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:04,100
See, we'll be back in just a few more minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1712
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:10,940
Don't go anywhere.

1713
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,740
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1714
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:20,900
We are live with the 435th episode of our show on this November the 13th of 2011.

1715
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:24,620
And during the break there, I was watching Loki play a little bit of Saints Row the Third,

1716
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,120
which he has hooked up here in studio, which he's playing.

1717
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,220
And he's just running around punching people in the face.

1718
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,800
This game is very purple.

1719
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,780
Like I know I was getting that in the art and everything, but like the game, the nights,

1720
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:37,660
the sky is all lit up purple and the pause is purple.

1721
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:39,140
This is a purple people leader game.

1722
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,660
Well, the reason why a lot of it's purple is because...

1723
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:43,340
Is that like your game color?

1724
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:47,340
Yes, it's your game color and also as you start taking over territories, you'll see

1725
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:52,340
a lot of the lights turn purple and they kind of indicate, you know, that you've taken it

1726
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:53,340
over.

1727
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:54,340
Gotcha.

1728
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:55,340
All right.

1729
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:56,340
Well, there you go.

1730
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:57,340
Saints Row.

1731
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,340
We are live.

1732
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:03,260
You can join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and comment on some of the rapid fire news

1733
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,260
we're about to get to.

1734
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:07,140
So Loki, you got to pause Saints Row to go over some rapid fire news.

1735
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:08,140
Yes.

1736
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:11,660
And we'll talk a little bit more about Saints Row because Saints Row 4 has already been

1737
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:17,980
out by, you know, the guys over at THQ and not a big surprise because I think this game

1738
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:21,800
is going to do well for them, but let's see here.

1739
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:30,380
It was Danny Bilson, the executive vice president and apparently, you know, he was saying that

1740
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:35,340
the fourth game is going to be even more over the top than the third game and he already

1741
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:43,420
knows what the, uh, the premise is about and Saints Row in space.

1742
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:44,420
Loki just pointed at me.

1743
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:46,220
Well, you think that's it?

1744
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,580
Let's not, let's get, not get ahead of ourselves.

1745
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:51,100
Well, you said more over the top than this one.

1746
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:56,900
I mean, like how did the Friday the 13th series end up going like just too far over the top

1747
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:59,460
by sending Jason to space?

1748
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:01,300
That is part of the DLC actually.

1749
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:10,620
It's pimps in space or like a gangsters in space is literally the, uh, yes, it is part

1750
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:11,620
of the DLC.

1751
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:15,820
I'm not sure if you actually go to space, but it's one of them.

1752
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:16,820
All right.

1753
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:17,820
Fair enough.

1754
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:18,820
Um, so yeah, interesting.

1755
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:21,940
Um, and then, uh, this of course this is kind of cool.

1756
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:27,840
Uh, they're going to be doing a free to play MMO for the, um, are based on game of thrones,

1757
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,220
the book and TV series and actually just finished watching the first season of that.

1758
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:37,460
So it's kind of cool and it kind of a coincidentally, uh, also Atlas announced that they're going

1759
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:42,900
to be publishing game of thrones on xbox 360 and PlayStation three coming up this March

1760
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,900
if I remember correctly.

1761
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:51,580
Um, so yeah, uh, lots of stuff based on that property I guess cause it is pretty, it's

1762
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:52,580
pretty good actually.

1763
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:53,580
People like that show.

1764
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:54,580
Yeah.

1765
01:27:54,580 --> 01:28:00,020
Um, and then of course, last but not least, uh, dead island is receiving a patch which

1766
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:01,900
will do a few things.

1767
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:10,740
Also gonna be raising the level cap to a 60 and um, you know, they also included us some

1768
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:16,180
new blueprints for weapon mods added, um, infected damage reduce and a bunch of other

1769
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:17,940
gameplay improvements.

1770
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:22,760
Also some fixes to the interface and just improve stability and network performance

1771
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,780
and co-op and that kind of stuff.

1772
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:30,920
So, um, neat, uh, in our chat room, a chat, I don't know, it sounds really calm or a little

1773
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:31,920
bit buffered here.

1774
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,740
So the chat is just now here in the saints row story and uh, um, orange right in our

1775
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:40,300
chat room says pimps at sea.

1776
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,580
Is there a, is there saints row on the ocean?

1777
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:45,340
Is there pirates versus ninjas in saints row?

1778
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:50,700
Uh, you can have pirates or ninjas as, uh, well I don't know about pirates, but I know

1779
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,380
you can have ninjas in your gang.

1780
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:53,380
Okay.

1781
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:57,060
I was gonna say, maybe that's, that's some of their, they could go with it.

1782
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:00,620
I mean you can dress up like a pirate on the high seas, you dress up pretty much like anything

1783
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:01,620
you want.

1784
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,620
All right.

1785
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:03,660
All right.

1786
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:05,540
And game guru says pimps in space.

1787
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:06,540
Okay.

1788
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,100
I really need to get into saints row.

1789
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:10,380
All right.

1790
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:13,660
Moving on to, and THQ gives you no kickback Loki, right?

1791
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:15,380
You really are just that big a fanboy for saints row.

1792
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:16,380
I like the game.

1793
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:17,380
It's great.

1794
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:18,380
There you go.

1795
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:19,380
All right.

1796
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:20,380
Uh, I like this game too.

1797
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:24,740
It's going to be 13 and it's getting a sequel 13 two is coming out as if there weren't enough

1798
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:25,740
games coming out.

1799
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:28,220
But the good news is this one's not out till early, early next year.

1800
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:31,560
There are going to be some special edition, uh, packages for the game.

1801
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,340
Now I'm going to report on what's coming out in Europe.

1802
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:38,160
However, apparently a lot of this is going to be coming to North America as well.

1803
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:41,180
So there is going to be a collector's edition that will come with special packaging and

1804
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:47,420
a game, a composer soundtrack, CD, an artwork book, six postcards featuring CG artwork of

1805
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:51,900
the characters and a lenticular art print of lightning, who isn't even the main character

1806
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:52,900
in the game.

1807
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:53,900
So go figure.

1808
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:57,420
There's also, I guess, a crystal edition that comes with all that, but instead of a single

1809
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:03,460
CD, you get a four disc soundtrack and you get a final fantasy 13 two t-shirt that you

1810
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:05,440
can't get anywhere else.

1811
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,340
And of course, I guess like a little presentation box.

1812
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:11,740
So a lot of the same pre-order stuff will be coming to America as well, because Hey,

1813
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:15,140
if you're going to, if you're going to spend 60 bucks on a game, why not spend 80 and get

1814
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:17,620
a free t-shirt and soundtrack, huh?

1815
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:18,620
Sure.

1816
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:19,620
Sure.

1817
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,500
You got to really love that though.

1818
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:26,580
There are some other black Friday deals here that we wanted to mention real quick.

1819
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:32,300
Uh, at this part, there is, uh, some special bundles coming out and one of them of note

1820
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:35,180
is a Zelda 3DS bundle.

1821
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,900
That's going to be like a special edition.

1822
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,480
And a lot of these have been cited around the internet.

1823
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,060
This is making its way to the U S for one 79.

1824
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:47,380
It's a black system that comes with the legend of Zelda Ocarina of time 3d.

1825
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:52,820
There's also going to be a flare red that comes with Mario 3d land that is both available

1826
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:53,820
at Walmart.

1827
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:59,140
Uh, apparently GameStop is also going to have a similar, uh, bundle going on, but unfortunately

1828
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:01,340
they're not like special branded systems.

1829
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:02,340
They're just the regular.

1830
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:07,660
Oh, I thought they had the Zelda artwork on, uh, only in Europe and boo, hiss and stuff.

1831
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:12,540
Um, yeah, only the plain Jane system when I was reading about that, I thought it was

1832
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:13,540
a special.

1833
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,540
I'm glad you clarified.

1834
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:16,980
Uh, some rumors about the next Xbox.

1835
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:21,860
Apparently the prototype name is loop, which is good that we have a different name for

1836
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:22,860
it now.

1837
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:24,140
Cause it's not going to be Xbox seven 20.

1838
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:26,380
Why would it be Xbox seven 20?

1839
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:27,380
That's a huge assumption.

1840
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:31,700
So I like loop that that makes me think that now they're naming these after books in the

1841
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:32,960
ring series.

1842
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:33,960
So we'll see.

1843
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,860
Cause Hey, Xbox three 60 had a bunch of rings as their logo.

1844
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:39,140
So why not have loop is the next one.

1845
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:40,140
Anyhow.

1846
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:44,380
I guess as some type of inside blog, you know, take it with a grain of salt, whatever, uh,

1847
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:46,700
loop is the code name for it.

1848
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:53,940
It's supposed to have all this boosted technology called assistive cores inside, uh, including,

1849
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:58,380
you know, graphics, AI, physics, sound networking, encryption sensors.

1850
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:01,360
It's supposed to be smaller and cheaper than the three 60.

1851
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,960
I'm assuming that means when this three 60 initially came out, it's going to run on a

1852
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,920
modified version of windows nine.

1853
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,780
That's not too surprising really all things considered.

1854
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:13,420
I mean, isn't the Xbox now starting to look more and more like windows eight and some

1855
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:16,940
of the prototypes are showing that it's running on windows nine and they're like, some of

1856
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:21,220
the rumors I've been hearing are like, it's going to be out next year, either late next

1857
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:25,780
year or early next, uh, the, you know, 2013 I'm like, so they're going to go through eight

1858
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:26,780
that fast.

1859
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:31,860
Well, if it's a modified windows nine, that leaves a lot of room for interpretation there.

1860
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:33,420
Um, so who knows?

1861
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:38,300
So whatever we're going to have, have rumors galore, we won't have anything solid till

1862
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:41,660
eight and I'm not surprised either because I think that they're going to be windows eight.

1863
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:46,260
One of the things about that is they're going to do a lot of, you know, compatibility with

1864
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:48,580
different arm processors and stuff.

1865
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:52,300
So if they're, you know, trying to make it so that can run on pretty much everything,

1866
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,860
um, that wouldn't surprise me.

1867
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:57,540
Why does the chat room think I said Xbox three 60 lube?

1868
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:58,540
Did I say lube?

1869
01:32:58,540 --> 01:32:59,540
He said lube.

1870
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:01,940
I said lube lube would be a fun name.

1871
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:04,980
I don't know why they're all like, did he say the Xbox lube?

1872
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:09,340
Then it would be a smooth move.

1873
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:12,420
Now I kind of like the name Xbox lube.

1874
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,660
We're getting you ready.

1875
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:18,020
That'll be the, uh,

1876
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:24,580
that'll be the, uh,

1877
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:25,580
love it.

1878
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:26,580
All right.

1879
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:31,520
It's now we are now officially calling the next Xbox, the Xbox lube, especially in light

1880
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,600
of the recent hackings of money that's been taken.

1881
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,540
And it seems very appropriate that it would be lubing you up to, uh, have stuff stolen

1882
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,900
from you.

1883
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:43,340
The Xbox lube awful coming in 2013 coming.

1884
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:44,660
All right.

1885
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:49,140
Dark Sakura, I'm feeling kind of nauseous now.

1886
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:51,780
Kaijuto says, I like Xbox lube.

1887
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:53,540
The blue Ray will slide in better.

1888
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:56,940
So how about some dragon quest 10?

1889
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:59,340
If you are in the Japanese beta, you get a free hat.

1890
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:04,500
Notice I said the Japanese beta, because it's only the beta in Japan.

1891
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,540
You have to have a Japanese query mix account to be able to sign up for it.

1892
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:13,520
So not Japan sucks to be you, well, it does suck anyway, but anyway.

1893
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,460
So how about some Bioshock infinite?

1894
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:18,380
It's going to have a special move peripheral.

1895
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:26,460
Um, it, uh, well it says it will draw you deeper into the version, this vision of a

1896
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:31,820
parallel future, blah, blah, blah, um, but we don't know what it is.

1897
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:34,100
I bet it's a hose.

1898
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:36,300
Actually they confirm that that's not actually happening.

1899
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,300
No.

1900
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,300
Okay.

1901
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:41,620
Well saints row, the third, how about that dildo that you were playing with?

1902
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:43,060
It was floppy.

1903
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:48,900
Well, um, for the Japanese version, the penetrator has been censored.

1904
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:54,760
The veins and physics from the dildo was meant to be removed because they have stricter

1905
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:57,500
guidelines on how you can display a phallus.

1906
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,100
And I think they also took out the balls as well.

1907
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:06,320
Uh, I do not believe the testicles were on the penetrator.

1908
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,300
This is very serious, Rob, why are you laughing?

1909
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:13,440
I'm sorry, they have effectively neutered the weapon.

1910
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,560
It looks like a purple vibrator now.

1911
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:19,400
It's totally gonna throw everything off.

1912
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:23,860
My favorite is that all these very serious game blogs had to report, well yes, I had

1913
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:26,980
to make the dildo less veiny.

1914
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:27,980
You know what?

1915
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:28,980
Had to take out his floppy physics.

1916
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:29,980
You know what?

1917
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:34,080
It would be awesome to have, they gave this out and of course they can't do this out over

1918
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:39,440
here because it would be tasteless, but in certain other countries like Denmark and Finland

1919
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:46,680
or whatever, uh, they were actually shipping them recreations of the penetrator, actual

1920
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,940
size recreations of the penetrator.

1921
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:52,860
It's a giant four foot long dildo on a stick.

1922
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:53,940
On a baseball bat.

1923
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:57,480
On a baseball bat that these, uh, blog people had.

1924
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:02,320
I would display that proudly if- I'm looking for pictures.

1925
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,320
Go to Kotaku.

1926
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,320
Kotaku.

1927
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,320
Kotaku has that.

1928
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:08,360
Oh yeah, because she's got to post them in the Orange Launch Radio Tumblr account because

1929
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:12,520
we haven't really been posting a lot over there tonight, so here you go.

1930
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:19,540
Alright, um, I wanted to- They show what it looks like in Japan and it's, um, rigid.

1931
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:20,540
Very rigid.

1932
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:23,320
Beautiful.

1933
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:27,320
Alright moving on to, uh, talking about- This is actually from Tumblr.

1934
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:30,280
I wanted to talk about this real quick before we get into some long form news because I

1935
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:34,040
saw this around Twitter and this is a nice story.

1936
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,840
I want to share this nice story with you guys and see what you guys think about it, okay?

1937
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:43,440
So, um, this- I got to abridge this because I don't want to read this verbatim, but, uh,

1938
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,440
where is this coming from?

1939
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:49,760
I think the original Tumblr user that posted this was iHeartChaos, was the original post

1940
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:55,400
of this, um, and it says, I just got back from the midnight release of the game Skyrim.

1941
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:59,560
And he's talking about there's a 13 year old boy there and he got a new copy of the game

1942
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:04,440
and five feet out the door some douchebag took it, ran off with it, and the kid was

1943
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,040
obviously about to burst into tears.

1944
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:09,840
He'd ridden his bike two miles in the cold at night to get the game.

1945
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,480
He actually had sold a bunch of his Yu-Gi-Oh cards and did housework for his parents to

1946
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:19,080
get it and the guy who wrote this said, I had an idea, save my place in line, and he

1947
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,520
went through the line, told other people about the situation, collected a bunch of money,

1948
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:28,280
five bucks here and there and so forth, and he was able to raise the money for a new copy,

1949
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:32,280
bought the kid a new copy and the kid was, you know, very thankful about it and so forth

1950
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,880
and the kid said, do you need anything in return?

1951
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:39,280
And the guy says, I told him, young man, I just hope one day you'll do something equally

1952
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:40,280
nice for someone.

1953
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:44,600
So, you know, it's a very, it's a very inspiring pay it forward type of story, right?

1954
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:47,000
So it's very, very nice.

1955
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,360
Does anyone now, and I read this on Twitter and I was like, that's sweet, but I mean,

1956
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:55,560
I'm going to be a bitch here because there's something kind of really wrong with this story.

1957
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:56,920
Did anyone else pick up on it?

1958
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:57,920
Yep.

1959
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,920
I picked up on it.

1960
01:37:58,920 --> 01:37:59,920
What did you pick up on, Loki?

1961
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,140
I picked up on the fact, first off, it's a child.

1962
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:03,140
That's right.

1963
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:04,140
In an M rated game.

1964
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:05,140
That's right.

1965
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:08,040
Loki, I said at the very beginning, it was a 13 year old who rolled his bike and sold

1966
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,160
his Yu-Gi-Oh cards to get a midnight.

1967
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,160
Was it a midnight launch?

1968
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:12,160
A midnight launch.

1969
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:14,360
Oh, his parents are wonderful.

1970
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:18,640
If now, this is going to sound really rude, but this is the point when you start to look

1971
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:22,840
at, at situations like that, do you go, is this story real?

1972
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:26,640
Maybe the story's not real like, and I know that sounds like a horrible thing to say,

1973
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:30,600
but I think I have a right to be skeptical because what parent, let's say a 13 year old

1974
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,560
ride their bike at midnight at night.

1975
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:37,560
I mean, I guess there's some crazy people out there, but it does, it does well and see

1976
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:42,480
what happens when that, when you do let your 13 year old out at midnight and seriously,

1977
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:45,160
why are people like robbing people of games?

1978
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,400
I mean, that's, I mean, that's that part shitty.

1979
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:51,880
Go like steal it from a store or something sadly, you know, and then there's that part

1980
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:56,480
and it makes me go, well, you know, that definitely could be legit that somebody is going to steal

1981
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,680
an X-Box game right out of a kid's hands.

1982
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:01,780
I mean, that's really fucking classy, but unfortunately there's some people in this

1983
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:09,400
world that are just not have no class whatsoever and would do something like that, but you

1984
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:12,880
know, there's also that part of me that's like, but it's a 13 year old trying to buy

1985
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,160
an M rated game.

1986
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:18,400
The game starts, I don't mean to be all spoilery, but within the first five minutes of playing

1987
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:24,220
Skyrim, you're going to see some guy get his head chopped off old style execution style.

1988
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:27,560
And it's like, do you want your 13 year old to see that?

1989
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:30,680
Maybe not like some 13 year olds can probably handle it.

1990
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:36,120
I watched red Sonia when I was what, seven, but that was your parents' choice.

1991
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:43,600
No it wasn't and you didn't ride two miles in the dark at midnight to go do it.

1992
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,520
Maybe the parents let the kid did this.

1993
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,720
Maybe the parents let the kid did this and that's fine, whatever.

1994
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:49,720
He's not my kid.

1995
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:55,360
But then I go, but the store and effectively allowed this perfect stranger to buy an M

1996
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,320
rated game for a 13 year old.

1997
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:01,940
I mean, regardless of the reason, isn't that not supposed to be happening?

1998
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:04,520
That is not supposed to be happening.

1999
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:10,760
So now, now my other question is, am I a bitch for my mind instantly going here?

2000
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:16,600
Well let me, on a feel good, warm, fuzzy wuzzy, gamers do good story.

2001
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,640
No he didn't do good cause he, he basically bought the game.

2002
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:25,380
He should have, I don't know, whatever, his parents should have taken care of it.

2003
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:30,520
So all right, is it wrong that I'm color correcting this picture of a dildo?

2004
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:31,520
You're just really bored.

2005
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,360
All right, wait a minute, you're doing a show.

2006
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,360
How can you be bored?

2007
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,760
Uh, because I'm putting it on the...

2008
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:40,840
Moving on, let's get to some more gaming news, Loki.

2009
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:48,920
So of course, you know, one of the things that's popular nowadays is online passes.

2010
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:54,400
And you know, as much as I love Saints Row the Third, this is kind of fucked up.

2011
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:58,080
And it's basically with their, their online pass.

2012
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:01,560
Okay, I kind of figured that this game would have an online pass.

2013
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:06,360
My problem with it is that, say I didn't want to play online.

2014
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:12,020
Say I bought the game, cause it has system link, praise system link, awesome.

2015
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:15,640
And I want to play with my friend, um, you know, over system link.

2016
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:18,240
In order for me to do that, I have to put in an online pass code.

2017
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:19,240
That's right.

2018
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:23,460
If I bought this game used, and I had no intention to play it online at all, I wanted to play

2019
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:27,520
it system link, I would have to pay $10 to get a code.

2020
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:30,960
An online pass to play offline.

2021
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:31,960
What is up with that?

2022
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:37,420
But yes, that is the case, um, you know, they have a screenshot of the actual online pass

2023
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:38,420
code.

2024
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:42,360
I have my own online pass code, and yeah, you can do it.

2025
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:47,800
Oh, and of course, you know, because the comp is early, it's not actually on the site yet,

2026
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:51,640
so I can't actually play co-op with anybody yet.

2027
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,800
But uh, that's fucked up.

2028
01:41:53,800 --> 01:42:00,680
I mean, I thought the whole point of these online passes, and it's not even me calling

2029
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:01,680
it an online pass.

2030
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:06,760
It's not like, you know, okay this is an Ubi Uplay thing, this is gonna unlock bonus contents.

2031
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:10,260
It says, your online pass code.

2032
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:13,320
So if I'm not playing this online, and the whole reason that you're charging this is

2033
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:20,360
because online servers cost money to run, then, then basically you're just taking money

2034
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:21,960
for the hell of it.

2035
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:24,400
You know, um, I don't know.

2036
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,840
I mean, you should have had system link outside of it.

2037
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,960
Now, here's why they don't have system link outside of it.

2038
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,380
Because they know this game's gonna get pirated, and they also know that there are ways that

2039
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:38,100
you can play online co-op with somebody else via system link.

2040
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:42,540
And that's why they put this behind a code, because if they're gonna at least make some

2041
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:47,540
money off this pirated copy, if you're gonna play online and play co-op, whether it be

2042
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:50,720
through system link or whatever, then they're gonna make $10 off it.

2043
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:52,440
That's the true reason why it's like this.

2044
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:57,120
But still, for legitimate people that, you know, wanna play this game, say buy it used

2045
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:58,120
or whatever.

2046
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:02,680
It's a further case of legitimate buyers getting screwed over, anti-piracy measures that'll

2047
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,160
get hacked to shit anyway.

2048
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:08,720
Yeah, I mean, because I agree this game's awesome, and you should buy it, and, you know,

2049
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:13,240
if you can buy it new, great, because I think you should play it sooner than later, but

2050
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:17,440
not everyone can buy it new, and you shouldn't be expected to have to pony out, you know,

2051
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,520
money for something that maybe you're not sure that you'd like it or something.

2052
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:24,200
Well, granted, but when you do buy the game new, you don't, I mean, we have to remember

2053
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:27,480
that online passes don't affect those that buy new.

2054
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:33,760
Yeah, but it's still, it still ain't, well, and actually, no, it does kind of affect me

2055
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,880
if buying it new, because I plan a lot of different systems that work, so if I wanna

2056
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:44,640
play system link co-op now, I can only play on my system, and, you know, I'd have to get

2057
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,140
another copy new.

2058
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:49,440
You can't, like, download the data to USB and then go to a friend's house and put the

2059
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:50,440
USB in there?

2060
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:51,440
No.

2061
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,440
Oh, wow.

2062
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,440
I don't think so.

2063
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,440
I think it's tied to your system.

2064
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:55,440
Could it be tied to your account?

2065
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:56,440
It might be tied to your account.

2066
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,440
You might be able to do it.

2067
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,440
Yeah.

2068
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:02,080
Even still, though, I would have to log in online anyways to play system link, you know,

2069
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:04,240
because you have to download, it's DLC, basically.

2070
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:05,240
Oh, yeah.

2071
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,800
So DLC is usually tied to your system.

2072
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:08,920
Right.

2073
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:12,400
And you can't play the same account on two systems to system link, can you?

2074
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,400
No.

2075
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:14,700
Ah, see, that's the trick.

2076
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:18,640
So you are kind of getting screwed in that regard.

2077
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:20,040
Yep.

2078
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:26,080
Hmm, well, it's a, it's a good thing to know before the game comes out, I think, especially

2079
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:29,120
for people who might be considering buying it, waiting to get it used or whatever.

2080
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,440
Well, and here's the thing, though.

2081
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:33,580
They didn't tell anybody it was gonna have this.

2082
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:38,600
It was just, it happened to be a reviewer or whatever said, hey, it has an online pass.

2083
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,600
It's something to report on.

2084
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:43,960
They didn't tell, you know, anybody, like, if that reviewer hadn't said anything, you

2085
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:47,080
know, I'm sure, obviously, it's gonna get out there early and people would say something,

2086
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:50,760
but let's just say, devil's advocate here, that no one said anything.

2087
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:52,400
THQ would have not said anything.

2088
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,320
You would get home with your copy of the game.

2089
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,400
You're like, what the fuck is this?

2090
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:58,400
And they already have your 60 bucks.

2091
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,840
But now you're getting used, you're getting used to seeing those things in every game.

2092
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:07,640
Yeah, but, and I have no problem with games that, you know, if they want to charge that

2093
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:12,240
because they're saying, okay, well, we need to fund our servers or whatever the case may

2094
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:15,440
be, you know, and it's an online game.

2095
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:18,320
I have a problem with it on Xbox 360.

2096
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:21,700
I'm already paying 50 bucks a month for that.

2097
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:24,480
Why is, why are Microsoft games allowed to charge for this?

2098
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:31,080
And now, granted, Microsoft first party games haven't done it because they know better because

2099
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:35,760
we're gonna go apeshit on them when they try to pull that shit because that's true double

2100
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,240
dipping right there.

2101
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:40,240
But right now, it's really only the third parties that are doing it.

2102
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:44,200
And now Sony, but Sony, you know, Sony's online thing is free already.

2103
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:50,960
I mean, I give this way more justification on the PlayStation than I do on the Xbox because

2104
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:53,760
I'm already paying 50 bucks a month to play online on the Xbox.

2105
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,960
Yeah.

2106
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:59,160
That's kind of what pisses me off about the online pass in that regard.

2107
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:04,120
But anyhow, rumors abound that a new Zelda game is on its way.

2108
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:11,520
It's being made for the 3DS series producer, Eiji Onuma, talked to a Portuguese website,

2109
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,240
My Games, and said the following, quote, we are already preparing a new game, a game in

2110
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:20,600
the series for the Nintendo 3DS, but don't think that it is a direct sequel to the Zelda

2111
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,480
titles released on DS.

2112
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:27,280
We are talking about a new game, but it takes much of what has been done on previous handhelds.

2113
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:30,560
Some folks are saying, is this sort of Majora's Mask?

2114
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:32,160
I'm actually thinking no.

2115
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:36,520
I think, you know, I'm kind of reading really a lot into this, but I think it's definitely

2116
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:38,840
a new Zelda title, which kind of seems like a duh.

2117
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,280
There's gonna be the major Nintendo franchises, but look at everything that's kind of been

2118
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:43,280
leading up to this.

2119
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:48,060
You know, Nintendo has been talking about, yeah, we need more big releases on the 3DS,

2120
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:52,160
and we have some things that are coming in 2012 that we're not ready to announce yet.

2121
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:58,600
I think Zelda 3DS is probably the big thing that's being unveiled next E3 on the 3DS.

2122
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:02,600
I mean, duh, right?

2123
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:06,880
It's gonna be some big first party game, and if they're gonna refuse to give me F-Zero

2124
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:11,840
another year, then it's gonna be probably Zelda.

2125
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,640
Most likely.

2126
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:15,560
This doesn't surprise me at all.

2127
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,820
And I don't want it to be Majora's Mask.

2128
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:22,660
I get that some people want that remade too, whatever, fine, but I think I'd rather just

2129
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:23,800
have a new Zelda game.

2130
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:27,100
Why not a new experience?

2131
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:31,500
The Mario game's apparently pretty good, so they're capable of taking the old franchises

2132
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,000
and making them fun in 3D.

2133
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,480
Why not Zelda?

2134
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:37,200
I'm sure it'll be a new game.

2135
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,200
It'll be cool.

2136
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,840
Hopefully it won't take five years to develop.

2137
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:42,180
We'll see though.

2138
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:44,080
Let's get to the mailbag.

2139
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:49,400
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and Dark Soccer's

2140
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:55,040
gonna dive into the email bag and pick out the one email that came in this week that's

2141
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,040
worth reading.

2142
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:58,640
Well, we have all the rest of those, fam.

2143
01:47:58,640 --> 01:47:59,640
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

2144
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:03,300
Now, I realize a lot of you have been busy playing Modern Warfare and Skyrim and Mario

2145
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:05,520
and so forth, but let's make her work next week.

2146
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,280
We want to hear no opinions on the panel tonight about Modern Warfare.

2147
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:11,480
I need emails on Modern Warfare.

2148
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:14,440
Tell me why this sold nine million copies or whatever the first day.

2149
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:15,440
I need to understand.

2150
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:16,840
I'm not hating on the game.

2151
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:17,840
I just want to know.

2152
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:18,840
Hater.

2153
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:19,840
I'm not hating on it.

2154
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,840
It's just not my type of game.

2155
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:21,840
Hater's gonna hate.

2156
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,440
But I want to know why other people get so riled up about it.

2157
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:25,440
Can I read the email?

2158
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,440
Yes.

2159
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:27,440
Hey, Orange Loungers.

2160
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:28,680
It's Jim Sally.

2161
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,440
I live for holiday deals.

2162
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:35,120
I've gotten everything from cheap games online and stood in line for big screen TVs.

2163
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:37,640
What's the best holiday deal you ever got?

2164
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:43,800
Once I bought an original, I said original, original Xbox 5.1 sound system for $75 on

2165
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:46,520
Boxing Day because it was a return.

2166
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:50,080
At least the guy in the parking lot with his trunk open said so.

2167
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:51,080
Mmm.

2168
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:52,080
Thanks, guys.

2169
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,480
Sundays are orange forever, Jim Sally.

2170
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:58,360
Yeah, I'd recommend never buying something out of a trunk, not that I would ever do that.

2171
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:04,520
Actually, no, I have never done that, so, but, you know, they tend to sell you stereo

2172
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:11,440
systems that are actually brick painted black and stuff like that, so, you know.

2173
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:16,120
I would say the best holiday deal I ever got was my HDTV for $600.

2174
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:19,160
Keep in mind, this was in the year, I think, 2004.

2175
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:23,380
I got it at Costco, and it was back when HDTVs were not flat.

2176
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:26,120
They had the giant backs like the old school TVs still.

2177
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,920
That thing was heavy as hell.

2178
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:29,640
That was a big TV.

2179
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:33,200
Did I get that when I was living with you, Loki, or was that, that was when I was living

2180
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:34,200
with Extifer.

2181
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:40,680
I finally got that, but that was only $600, which then was, like, dirt cheap for an HDTV.

2182
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:43,120
I don't know if you remember that TV the other time.

2183
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:46,560
You know where you can see that TV?

2184
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:52,200
It's in the news report that Channel 3 did on us that somebody put up on YouTube.

2185
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,280
You're playing DDR on that old TV.

2186
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:57,280
Let me see if I can find it.

2187
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:58,280
Yeah.

2188
01:49:58,280 --> 01:49:59,280
This is a good time to revisit that on YouTube, too.

2189
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:02,520
I thought I was playing DDR on, uh- You were playing on the cabinet.

2190
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,520
On the cabinet?

2191
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,520
Yeah, you were playing on the cabinet.

2192
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:05,520
No, no, no.

2193
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:06,520
That was when The B did the article.

2194
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:12,040
That was the Sacramento B. Well, the one with the rock band, not rock band, but guitar hero

2195
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:13,040
was here at my house.

2196
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,040
No, no.

2197
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,080
He's talking about the, uh- On my old TV.

2198
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:22,400
Don't you remember the, don't you remember the It's So Much Fun story that led to that

2199
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:23,400
whole thing?

2200
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:25,280
Don't you remember that?

2201
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,280
That was, oh, look.

2202
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,280
I found it.

2203
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,280
I found it here.

2204
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,280
It's still on YouTube.

2205
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:30,280
Look at this.

2206
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:35,280
We're joining the podcasting craze that's becoming a web craze, but what is it?

2207
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,280
How does it work?

2208
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:42,000
KCRA 3's Brian Hickey tonight shows us how people are using podcasting to inform, entertain,

2209
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,200
and share their thoughts with the world.

2210
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:46,760
It's Jamie Speed.

2211
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:50,800
It's called Dance Dance Revolution, or DDR, a popular game-

2212
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:51,800
There.

2213
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:52,800
There's the ginormous TV.

2214
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:53,800
Remember that guy?

2215
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:54,800
Yeah.

2216
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:55,800
I got that for 600 bucks.

2217
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:57,560
That was a steal back then.

2218
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:00,080
October 9th, 2006, but anyway.

2219
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:05,320
Now that I have this up- I was thinking of the Wega, but the Wega was, um, dude's TV.

2220
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:07,420
Now that we're, this is a five-year-old clip now.

2221
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:08,420
Now I want to watch the rest of it.

2222
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:09,420
No, I don't want to watch it.

2223
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:15,480
It started off tiny and it's grown.

2224
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:16,480
That's what she said.

2225
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,480
No, we're not playing this.

2226
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:22,120
No, I gotta hear that again.

2227
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:25,080
It started off tiny and it's grown.

2228
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:30,480
A subculture of pop culture, and these are the voices to unite and inform the gaming

2229
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:31,480
fans.

2230
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:32,480
A cliche thing.

2231
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:36,480
That's a cliche thing.

2232
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:40,400
Hello everybody once again, and welcome to-

2233
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:44,960
Remember that ginormous green chair we had randomly in the old studio in the Extrofer

2234
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:45,960
apartment?

2235
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:46,960
The one I would sleep in sometimes?

2236
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:48,360
Oh my God, that chair is gigantic.

2237
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:49,360
Anyway, sorry.

2238
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:55,120
...of our podcast from their apartment in Rancho Cordova using revolutionary technology.

2239
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:56,120
Oh my God.

2240
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,560
That was my old laptop that's in the garage now.

2241
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,240
Look how young we are in this picture.

2242
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:01,400
Like especially look at Loki.

2243
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,960
Like he looks so much younger in this clip.

2244
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:04,960
And I had hair.

2245
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:05,960
It's amazing.

2246
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:06,960
I look the same.

2247
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:07,960
I bet we will do that to you.

2248
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:08,960
Except your hair is shorter.

2249
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:09,960
And it's a different color.

2250
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:10,960
...for the world.

2251
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:17,240
We basically give the news for video games, popular culture, basically what gamers really

2252
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:18,240
want to know.

2253
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:23,000
Using a computer, podcast producers record their programs, then send them to a number

2254
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,520
of websites now hosting the shows.

2255
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:31,400
Now anyone can create, edit, and air their ideas, concerns, music, and all things audio

2256
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,840
to anyone else willing to download it.

2257
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,480
It's something they can take with them.

2258
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:39,260
It's a much more flexible way of spreading the information.

2259
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:44,120
With nothing more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones, you can listen to it anywhere.

2260
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:48,160
I love that they just interviewed some random dude bro, like who had his iPod with him.

2261
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:49,760
He's skating down the street.

2262
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:54,480
People can talk about things they like to talk about and other people can join in and

2263
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,480
listen to.

2264
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:58,980
And it's really open and lots of people can get into it.

2265
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:02,060
A number of websites are now hosting the podcast for free.

2266
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:06,700
The newest and biggest database to adopt the technology is Apple's iTunes.

2267
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:11,480
You just click on the podcast tab, type a topic in the search feature, and a list of

2268
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:14,200
available podcasts are at your fingertips.

2269
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:15,200
Free for you.

2270
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:16,500
Free for the producers.

2271
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:18,880
Free speech for everyone.

2272
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:19,880
It's so much fun.

2273
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:20,880
It's great.

2274
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:24,480
They can go eat a dick, okay?

2275
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,480
Interview me for a minute and a half.

2276
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:27,440
Let's play this two-second clip.

2277
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,960
They never show Loki's name, his real name.

2278
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:34,120
They never show anything but that one little clip, oh, it's so much fun.

2279
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:38,120
And then me talking about something a little more profound.

2280
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:39,520
Free for the producers.

2281
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:41,920
Free speech for everyone.

2282
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:42,920
It's so much fun.

2283
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:46,600
It's great that, you know, just anybody out there who really has a desire to want to be

2284
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:49,360
heard, you have an outlet for your voice to get out there.

2285
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,720
So podcasting is just wonderful.

2286
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:55,360
In Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey, KCRA 3 reports.

2287
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,360
I got to say more than everybody.

2288
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:58,360
That was kind of cool.

2289
01:53:58,360 --> 01:54:01,480
Recently, Governor Schwarzenegger began providing his weekly radio address as a podcast.

2290
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:06,600
It can be downloaded, so you can listen to it in your car as you walk or even as you're

2291
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,920
pumping iron in the gym.

2292
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:09,920
That's right.

2293
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,960
We were mentioned in the same breath as Governor Schwarzenegger.

2294
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:15,560
Yes, he really was the governor of California, if you weren't aware, he really, really was

2295
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:16,560
the governor.

2296
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,600
Did you notice that overhead cam shot trying to get my boobs?

2297
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:20,600
Seriously.

2298
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,800
The cameraman fancied you.

2299
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:23,800
Whatever.

2300
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:26,000
It's just because I'm a girl.

2301
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,080
And by the way, here's my favorite.

2302
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:31,180
Here's my favorite thing about that whole story.

2303
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:34,320
Our show is never named.

2304
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:38,920
They never say they don't want to have free advertising ever said, but when you when you

2305
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:42,000
watch him search, he's searching for Orange Lounge Radio.

2306
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,840
That was the shout out we got.

2307
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:47,240
But never did they say these three guys produce a show called Orange Lounge Radio.

2308
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:48,240
Nope.

2309
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:49,880
They play DDR and it's so much fun.

2310
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:56,000
And it's it started off tiny and it's grown.

2311
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,200
Cutting edge technology.

2312
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:00,560
These failed, crappy laptops.

2313
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,880
These guys are doing what Governor Schwarzenegger is doing.

2314
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:05,560
Pumping iron.

2315
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,560
Doing drugs.

2316
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:15,120
We are not making poor decisions.

2317
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:16,120
All right.

2318
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:17,120
Let's move on.

2319
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,120
Is that it for e-mails?

2320
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,960
Oh, holiday deals.

2321
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:24,440
We never we took a trip down memory lane and just totally ignored Jim Sally's one more

2322
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:25,440
e-mail.

2323
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:26,440
I mentioned the TV.

2324
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:28,240
Did anybody else get any really good holiday deals?

2325
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,240
They can remember.

2326
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:30,240
I don't remember.

2327
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:31,240
I don't care.

2328
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:37,920
I used to buy like different like media and stuff, you know, like seedy blanks and stuff

2329
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:44,120
like that, because they usually have some good deals on those, at least during the holidays.

2330
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:49,160
That was the only thing I could see you'd like going to like Best Buy or something for.

2331
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:50,720
All right.

2332
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:54,640
Mail bag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some e-mails in the future.

2333
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:55,640
All right.

2334
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:58,640
After that trip down memory lane, I'm sure that's going to ignite some fury amongst some

2335
01:55:58,640 --> 01:55:59,640
people.

2336
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:04,640
That's going to be part of the show we call the FUs of the week.

2337
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:24,680
I don't know, I guess just to feeling crappy.

2338
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:29,560
Yeah, F you to feeling crappy and F you to shame.

2339
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:31,880
Why is he getting an F you?

2340
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:36,040
Because I've listened to like a lot of Manson and every time I can't help it.

2341
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:39,440
He's got me liking a group that I can't get any new stuff from anymore.

2342
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:40,440
Oh yeah.

2343
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:41,440
Didn't they like break?

2344
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:44,880
They broke up years ago, but I just recently heard of them.

2345
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:45,880
Thanks to him.

2346
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:46,880
That group died, too.

2347
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:53,760
I don't know, but I'm mad at Shane only marginally, and I'm also mad at Shane for not catching

2348
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,880
up on Supernatural.

2349
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:57,920
So I can't talk to him about it.

2350
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:58,920
Sorry.

2351
01:56:58,920 --> 01:56:59,920
This is our chat room.

2352
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:03,040
Cause we were talking about the similarities between orange launch radio and governor Schwarzenegger,

2353
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:04,040
right?

2354
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:08,640
Kossin in the chat says, which one of the OLR hosts diddled the maid and salacious pop

2355
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:12,820
follows that up saying, is OLR going to suddenly reveal a 10 year old offspring from a Latina

2356
01:57:12,820 --> 01:57:16,040
domestic servant because that's something governor Schwarzenegger did.

2357
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:17,520
The show is the right age.

2358
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,520
We got really drunk after our second episode.

2359
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:20,520
Don't ask how this happened.

2360
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:24,480
Hey, I'm the only one that's, you know, physically capable of that.

2361
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:25,480
So shut up.

2362
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:30,680
No, I Loki or I could have boinked a maid, but, oh, that's right.

2363
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,760
I'm not a Latina maid.

2364
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:34,760
You definitely are not a Latina maid.

2365
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:35,760
Please.

2366
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,000
All right.

2367
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
FUs of the week.

2368
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Uh, Loki.

2369
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,640
Um, I would say my, if he goes through those people, I know I'm not sure if you've seen

2370
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:48,280
these, but they have these little signs that show how fast you're going and stuff like

2371
01:57:48,280 --> 01:57:49,280
that.

2372
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:52,600
It's, you know, kind of a reminder to do the speed limit or under the speed limit.

2373
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:55,640
I always, always speed up when I see them.

2374
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:59,720
Well, I see people like see those signs and they like slam on their brakes.

2375
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:02,000
I'm like, dude, it's a fucking sign.

2376
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,400
It's not going to write you a ticket.

2377
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:04,720
It's a sign.

2378
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:09,680
That's all it does is it showed you how fast you're going and not accurately by the way.

2379
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:13,700
My favorite thing to find out with those signs is how high it will track you before it starts

2380
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:16,160
getting angry and starts blinking.

2381
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:19,080
Like I always like to see like, what's the speed limit where it starts flashing, slow

2382
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:20,820
down asshole.

2383
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:25,920
So yeah, so I feed those people that think signs are real people that are going to write

2384
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:26,920
them tickets or something.

2385
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:28,120
It doesn't have a magical camera on it.

2386
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:32,480
I'm sure someday the signs will be able to write you a ticket and governments are hard

2387
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:33,800
up enough for the money.

2388
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:34,800
I guess.

2389
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:35,800
All right.

2390
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:40,720
Uh, my FU of the week goes to the headache I had today because headaches are terrible

2391
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:44,480
and yeah, it made me want to nap all day forever.

2392
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,720
Does it make you feel better Rob?

2393
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:48,360
What the giant purple dildo?

2394
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:49,360
No.

2395
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:52,840
It does not make me feel better.

2396
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:55,360
I kind of want one.

2397
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,920
I'd hang it up in the studio.

2398
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:57,920
Sure.

2399
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:58,920
I would.

2400
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:01,120
All right, let's move on with some more stories.

2401
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:06,680
The Skype line coming up soon, but first more news Loki studio sext engines, same difference.

2402
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:12,480
Um, so apparently, you know, we were talking a little bit about online passes and stuff.

2403
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:18,800
And one of the things that the online passes, if you want to call them that, um, do is basically

2404
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:27,000
the deter use game sales and um, but there's a report that's out that's saying that basically

2405
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:32,960
used in digital sales actually make up about 35% of total console spending and that's very,

2406
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:36,720
you know, it makes sense, you know, with a lot of the stuff nowadays, you know, available

2407
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:43,000
on the Xbox 360, uh, marketplace or, you know, the PlayStation network or even, you know,

2408
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:49,040
WiiWare stores and steam and whatever, um, it's not surprising that it would be about that much.

2409
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:54,360
Um, they're also saying that, um, you know, they show that 23% of the consoles purchased,

2410
01:59:54,360 --> 02:00:00,420
um, or console games purchased in the US are used and says slightly more in, uh, than the

2411
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:01,840
European market were.

2412
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:03,200
That's about 20%.

2413
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:11,400
Also, uh, digitally, um, just digitally distributed titles rank lower in both regions, I guess,

2414
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:16,200
taking up 12% of console market in America and nine in Europe.

2415
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:22,680
And also, I guess they're saying that the 12% that actually is approximately $960 million

2416
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:25,800
worth of content that's being purchased right there.

2417
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:31,840
Um, and, uh, they're saying that also 54% of American console owners are spending an

2418
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,800
average of $49 a year on console downloads.

2419
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:36,800
Hmm.

2420
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:41,440
And then, of course, uh, you know, talking a little bit about PC and you would kind of

2421
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:45,600
think that PC is going to be skewing more towards the digital side.

2422
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,600
Actually that's true.

2423
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:53,320
They're saying that 58% of all PC gaming dollars are spent digitally on games or DLC.

2424
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:55,320
So that's the way it's going in the PC market.

2425
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:57,480
Not so much in the console market.

2426
02:00:57,480 --> 02:01:00,560
Not surprised because you see PC retail shelves really dry.

2427
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:01,560
Oh yeah.

2428
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:02,560
Like it's not a surprise at all.

2429
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:07,920
In fact, now even, I mean, I know we don't talk a lot about gaming on the Mac, but you

2430
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:12,240
know, the app store delivery is like the big thing on the Mac now.

2431
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:15,400
They didn't even sell the latest OS upgrade like through the app store.

2432
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:16,400
I think so.

2433
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:17,400
Yeah.

2434
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:18,400
I haven't had a Mac in a long time.

2435
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:22,120
In fact, I gave my Mac to dark soccer who I guess just recently gutted it over the weekend

2436
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:26,240
or I'm actually going to be doing a reformat on it.

2437
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:27,240
It won't run Linux yet.

2438
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:29,160
What exactly are you going to do with that thing?

2439
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:32,640
I'm actually going to talk to people I know to take it apart and see about fixing the

2440
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:38,640
DVD, the DVD player and seeing what I can do to get Linux on it and make it do your

2441
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:39,640
evil bidding.

2442
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:45,760
But I want, there's a version of Linux that's meant to run on a Mac and mirror Mac OS only

2443
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:48,240
use a lot less memory and be a lot more efficient.

2444
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:49,880
Then she's going to install the grid on it.

2445
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:50,880
End of line.

2446
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,880
And then I'll move in.

2447
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:56,300
All right.

2448
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:59,520
But anyhow, only 35% huh, you would think with all these online passes and everything

2449
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,520
it was much higher.

2450
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:01,520
It doesn't seem so bad.

2451
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:09,120
No, cause I think the majority of, you know, cause you're looking at dollars and the majority

2452
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:12,080
of the stuff that's purchased online would be cheaper.

2453
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:15,360
And also a lot of, a lot more people are, you know, lined up to go to the stores to

2454
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:16,360
buy stuff.

2455
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:21,560
And also not a lot of stuff is like day and date with, you know, games on, you don't have

2456
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:28,400
it yet where you can buy, you know, call of duty at midnight on, you know, as a digital

2457
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:29,400
download.

2458
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:32,040
And I would be willing to bet if they did that, you'd probably see a lot of people going

2459
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,040
that route.

2460
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:38,400
Well, steam did launch Skyrim where you could download, you know, you preload the game and

2461
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,080
then you unencrypted at midnight.

2462
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:43,680
Like they did do that for Skyrim and I think they've done it for other big games too.

2463
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:48,800
So like steam does that a lot, but um, I'm seeing as far as like console stuff goes,

2464
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:51,800
um, you don't see that.

2465
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:52,800
That's true.

2466
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,800
You don't see consoles yet.

2467
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:54,800
Yet.

2468
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:55,800
Yeah.

2469
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:57,680
Wait, wait for the Xbox lube.

2470
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:02,280
Cause it's going to give the lube, it's going to lube up GameStop because uh, I bet a lot

2471
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:05,380
of these new consoles are going to go very, very heavy on digital distribution.

2472
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:08,800
So like GameStop can bend over.

2473
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:09,800
All right.

2474
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:11,800
Well, you all right?

2475
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:12,800
Nothing.

2476
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:13,800
Just listening to what Dan's playing.

2477
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:14,800
All right.

2478
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:15,800
What is he playing?

2479
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:16,800
Saints Row III.

2480
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:17,800
Oh, nice.

2481
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:18,800
Uh, moving on.

2482
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:23,600
Uh, one of the biggest complaints about the Wii U when it was announced to E3 this year

2483
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:24,840
is what?

2484
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:28,520
All the games will only work with the one controller, you know, because the, I guess

2485
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:32,680
the system that was not capable when they showed it at E3 of running games on multiple

2486
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:33,680
controllers.

2487
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:38,000
Cause you know, the touch screens, it's the, the device is basically processing the screen

2488
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,480
and what you're seeing on the TV.

2489
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:44,040
And so it was worrisome that, you know, you wouldn't be able to run multiple controllers.

2490
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:49,920
Well, however, apparently, uh, some, uh, some stuff is going on behind the scenes where

2491
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:55,920
they might actually be retooling the Wii U to work with multiple of those, uh, consoles.

2492
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:04,480
Uh, I guess there's a, uh, article on developonline.net that talks about Nintendo now knows they absolutely

2493
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:07,160
need to support two tablets.

2494
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:11,000
At E3 they didn't commit to this, but they know how important it is to make technically

2495
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,480
feasible to support two screens.

2496
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:16,720
And if that affects frame rate as a developer and player, I don't care.

2497
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:18,180
It needs to work.

2498
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:20,520
Developers will design appropriate games for this.

2499
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:24,600
If you're building a quiz game, you're not going to give a shit about the frame rate.

2500
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:25,600
Hmm.

2501
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:31,960
So apparently Nintendo is being pressured by developers to get this to work.

2502
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:34,080
Could it end up delaying the whole system?

2503
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:35,080
Maybe.

2504
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:38,000
Loki, you've already speculated the Wii U's not coming out next year.

2505
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,200
Uh, I wouldn't be surprised.

2506
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:43,000
I wouldn't be surprised if it was 2013.

2507
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:47,600
How is Nintendo gonna, I mean, I was gonna say how is Nintendo gonna recover next year,

2508
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:51,880
but we're hearing reports that 3DS sales are going way up because of Mario 3D Land, at

2509
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:52,880
least over in Japan.

2510
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:58,000
Well, I mean, it'll help, and I, you know, definitely what they're gonna have in the,

2511
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:06,280
you know, next year will help, but, um, I just, that's, that new system just sounds

2512
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:07,560
so broken right now.

2513
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:10,440
I mean, they have nothing to show for it yet.

2514
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:14,040
I mean, some tech demos that are basically Wii games.

2515
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:15,400
It's been six months.

2516
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:18,840
It's probably a lot further along than what we saw at E3, and it's gonna be a lot, lot

2517
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:21,120
further, further along next E3.

2518
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:23,600
So I don't think it's, it's a done deal yet.

2519
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:28,480
I think Nintendo knows that people were not as thrilled with Wii U as they were with the

2520
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:34,560
3DS, and I think come next E3, they're really prepared to just blow us away.

2521
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:38,720
And I think some hardcore developers getting up on that stage, some third-party developers

2522
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:43,840
gonna get up there and show, you know, Saints Row 4 or something on the Wii U, and how it's,

2523
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:45,800
you know, the technology is amazing or whatever.

2524
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:51,800
And obviously I'm just picking that, because I know it'll, it'll get you interested.

2525
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:52,800
Alright.

2526
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:53,800
No.

2527
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:54,800
No?

2528
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,680
Are you in no way know-how buying a Wii U?

2529
02:05:56,680 --> 02:06:00,040
No, I wouldn't say that, but I'm just saying, uh, I'm not-

2530
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:01,040
He's gonna steal one.

2531
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:02,040
Steal one, please.

2532
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:08,920
No, I'm not gonna, it's not something that right now I need to have.

2533
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:14,360
Game Guru in our chat room says, yeah, the GameCube could support four GBAs.

2534
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:15,760
There's a big difference there.

2535
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,520
The GBAs worked on their own.

2536
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:22,000
The GBAs had processors and game things independent of the GameCube.

2537
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,040
That's not the case with the Wii U.

2538
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:28,780
That little stream is base, it's basically like on live going on in your house.

2539
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:34,200
And that little Wii U is what's, the box is streaming the image to your tablet.

2540
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:38,520
It does have some processing power to those tablets, but they can't put a lot of processing

2541
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:41,080
power in there because they gotta keep the price down.

2542
02:06:41,080 --> 02:06:42,080
Right.

2543
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:43,080
I mean, you know.

2544
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:46,680
But maybe this is something, maybe, you know, maybe that's something they might have to,

2545
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:49,700
they might have to put more oomph in those tablets and make it more expensive.

2546
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:53,120
What they should have done is they should delay this shit for another few years when

2547
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:56,280
the price of those components comes down, then you can do that.

2548
02:06:56,280 --> 02:07:00,440
Yeah, but those tablets are essentially the lower half of a DS.

2549
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:02,080
How expensive can those be now?

2550
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:05,240
DSs are 79 bucks.

2551
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:08,160
I mean, like the lowest end DS is 79 bucks.

2552
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:10,400
You can't tell me that technology is that expensive.

2553
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:15,840
We're already expecting those tablets are gonna be $100 a pop.

2554
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:16,840
I don't know.

2555
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:17,840
So.

2556
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:21,460
All I know is I think it's a big old gimmick and I'm still not buying into it yet.

2557
02:07:21,460 --> 02:07:27,040
It's a fucking Wii with slightly better graphics and a goddamn tablet that's, what's that tablet

2558
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:28,040
gonna do for me?

2559
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:29,840
Oh, it's gonna stream some shit on it.

2560
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:30,840
Okay.

2561
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:31,840
Great.

2562
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,000
You know, this is shit that could have been on the screen.

2563
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,120
Oh, but we're moving the inventory.

2564
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:36,120
Okay.

2565
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:40,120
I, why should I spend $100 on a tablet?

2566
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:46,920
Because the, you know, to be neat, you're gonna put the inventory screen on this tablet

2567
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:50,520
instead of having push start to pop the inventory screen up.

2568
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:51,960
I mean, who gives a shit?

2569
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:56,080
Oh, we're gonna, we're gonna make our frame rate and stuff drop because we really need

2570
02:07:56,080 --> 02:08:04,840
this inventory screen to not be once again, and this is also goes to the connect too.

2571
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:06,740
Why can't I just do things the old way?

2572
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:08,600
Why can't I just push a button?

2573
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:09,960
Inventory screen pops up.

2574
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:13,040
Why do I need it to be, why do I need the map always on the bottom of the screen?

2575
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:15,640
If you want the map on the bottom screen, put it in the corner of the screen and be

2576
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:16,640
done with it.

2577
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:19,000
Why do I need the shout grenade to throw a grenade?

2578
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
You don't have to.

2579
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,000
No, I don't have to.

2580
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,760
But that's the thing, though, is in these games, you know, why do I have to waggle my

2581
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:25,900
controller to throw a grenade?

2582
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:27,180
Why can't I just push a button?

2583
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:28,760
It's stupid.

2584
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:30,640
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.

2585
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:34,240
All they have to do is get up on that stage and say, brand new F-Zero game coming to Wii

2586
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:36,680
U, and I preordered.

2587
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:37,680
That's all they would have to do.

2588
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:38,680
And you're part of the problem.

2589
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:41,680
I am absolutely part of the problem, but it's F-Zero, Loki.

2590
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:42,680
No, I don't care.

2591
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:44,680
It's the best GameCube game they had.

2592
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:45,680
Rah.

2593
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:49,820
You have to understand, Rob, those times are gone.

2594
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:52,880
They don't give a shit about F-Zero anymore, and if they do, it's gonna suck.

2595
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:54,440
Why are you so mean, Loki?

2596
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:55,440
Because you can't be.

2597
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:59,440
Next thing you're gonna tell me, the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus aren't real.

2598
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:00,440
Uh, Rob?

2599
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:01,440
What?

2600
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,440
They're not.

2601
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:03,440
Ahh!

2602
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:08,000
You're just saying the Easter Bunny's not real because you're Jewish.

2603
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
What?

2604
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Alright.

2605
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:15,120
You suck so much, heart.

2606
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:17,480
Moving on, more news.

2607
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:20,440
Hopefully that won't upset me, DarkSakura.

2608
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:22,120
How about some Street Fighter stuff?

2609
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:25,120
Yeah, let's kick some ass.

2610
02:09:25,120 --> 02:09:31,720
Well, the virtual console release of Super Street Fighter II on Genesis, you know, in

2611
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:35,480
Japan has Wi-Fi, so did P.O.P.O.

2612
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:43,000
But while we're getting the game, Street Fighter is not, no, yeah it is, it's actually gonna

2613
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,720
have the Wi-Fi capability.

2614
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:48,360
So that's kinda cool.

2615
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:49,520
But why not Puyo Puyo?

2616
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:52,600
Why not other stuff?

2617
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:56,100
Because unfortunately Street Fighter, well I mean, not unfortunately, but you know, Street

2618
02:09:56,100 --> 02:09:59,660
Fighter is Street Fighter, and you know, everybody likes Street Fighter.

2619
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:01,440
Only some people have even heard of Puyo Puyo.

2620
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:03,760
But Street Fighter II is, you know, huge.

2621
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:05,640
We should be able to play P.U.P.E.L.E.

2622
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:06,640
anywhere.

2623
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:11,440
But, I mean, yay for virtual console finally getting some online play capability about

2624
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:14,800
oh, five years too late.

2625
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:16,360
Also did you hear about how they're doing this?

2626
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:21,160
They're doing it through emulation of that, oh god, I forgot the name of it, the X-Mode,

2627
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:23,440
or what, what the fuck was that thing?

2628
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:24,440
The X-Mode?

2629
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:25,440
No.

2630
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:26,440
Now I forget.

2631
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,440
It's that, somebody in chat will yell it out.

2632
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:28,440
It's that...

2633
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:29,440
That online Genesis thing, right?

2634
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:30,960
No, not the Sega Channel.

2635
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:34,960
But it was, it was, it was Genesis and it was Super Nintendo.

2636
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:35,960
An X...

2637
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:36,960
Oh!

2638
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:42,080
And you could plug it in, and it sat between your cartridge and the console, and you could

2639
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:46,120
dial into this network and play P.U.P.E.L.E. like an old, old, old-ass version of Xbox

2640
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:47,120
Live X-Mode.

2641
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:48,120
I know what you're talking about.

2642
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:49,440
I thought, I thought that's the name of it.

2643
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:50,440
That's stupid.

2644
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:51,440
Somebody in chat will shout it.

2645
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:54,720
Ah, we don't want to do any work, let's just emulate this old shit.

2646
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:56,440
That's what they're doing to make it work.

2647
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:57,440
It's too stupid.

2648
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:00,760
We have to build an emulator, you know...

2649
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:04,680
If they can do it in Japan, why can't they do it here?

2650
02:11:04,680 --> 02:11:08,560
That's what they're doing in Japan, is they're using that emulation to do it.

2651
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:11,480
Of course, I'm believing everything I read on the internet, so it might not actually

2652
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:15,480
be true, but it wouldn't surprise me at all.

2653
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:17,480
So...

2654
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:20,480
Just silly.

2655
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:22,480
Yeah.

2656
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:23,480
X-band.

2657
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:24,480
Thank you, chatters.

2658
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:25,480
Who said that first?

2659
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:26,480
X-band.

2660
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:30,600
Orange Wright said it first.

2661
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:32,720
Have you ever seen the X-band?

2662
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:35,080
I think only like 7,000 of them were ever sold.

2663
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:36,080
Here's a picture of it.

2664
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:37,760
Oh, that's a tiny picture, but that's all I got.

2665
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:42,480
But you can kind of see how it sits between the cartridge and the console.

2666
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:43,480
Plug it in.

2667
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:44,480
X-band.

2668
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:45,480
Thank you.

2669
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:48,480
All right, Loki, what do you got for us?

2670
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:50,920
All right, let's talk about Modern Warfare.

2671
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:54,160
I know, we're saving the best for last, right?

2672
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:59,640
Modern Warfare 3, of course, not so surprisingly, broke all sorts of records.

2673
02:11:59,640 --> 02:12:08,760
It had the biggest launch ever for a game, and it sold 6.5 million units in one day.

2674
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:14,080
That's both in our total from U.S. and U.K.

2675
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:23,560
And of course, they're saying that they were estimating 9 million units, but I'd say give

2676
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:24,960
it a couple weeks.

2677
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:34,000
And of course, that puts the revenue for that game so far at 400 million dollars.

2678
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:43,640
And the previous record, of course, was 310 million dollars last year with Modern Warfare

2679
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:44,640
2.

2680
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:45,640
It was 310 million.

2681
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:47,640
Black Ops was 360 million.

2682
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:52,400
So next year, with whatever the fuck they come out with, it'll be higher than that,

2683
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:54,800
because people buy into this crap.

2684
02:12:54,800 --> 02:13:03,120
And not to say it's a bad game, but there's a lot of people buying that game.

2685
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:05,640
What draws everybody to this series?

2686
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:08,520
Popularity, I don't know.

2687
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:11,080
You think it's mob mentality?

2688
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:12,080
Friends?

2689
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:14,520
I don't know, what draws people to the world of Warcraft?

2690
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:15,520
They are pretty!

2691
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:16,520
I've seen them.

2692
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:18,600
Friends, you're right, social aspect, absolutely.

2693
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:22,800
And definitely that's something that they built up this time, so, maybe.

2694
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:25,040
Alright, last story for you guys.

2695
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:26,640
Oh, I know it draws people to it.

2696
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:29,920
It's because of the fact that little kids get to play this game because their parents

2697
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:30,920
suck.

2698
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:32,200
They let them go out to play launches.

2699
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:33,200
I don't think that's it.

2700
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:34,200
Oh, really?

2701
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:35,200
Yeah, I would...

2702
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:36,200
How many...

2703
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:41,560
How much do you want to bet that about 1 million of that 3.6 million sold is probably people

2704
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:44,560
under the age of 13?

2705
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:46,200
I don't know about 13.

2706
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:49,920
Under the age of 18, maybe.

2707
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:50,920
Definitely under the age of 18.

2708
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:52,920
17-year-olds and 16-year-olds, I believe it.

2709
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:56,960
Under the age of 15, I guarantee it.

2710
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:59,120
1 million at least.

2711
02:13:59,120 --> 02:14:03,920
Alright, moving on to one more story, and then we're going to get to Twitter topics.

2712
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:08,480
Twitter.com slash olr and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, and this is about another

2713
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:10,160
series that's being worked on.

2714
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:16,240
This is kind of a duh, but it's probably nice to hear that Gran Turismo 6, yep, it's underway.

2715
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:17,240
It's being developed.

2716
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:18,240
Of course it is!

2717
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:21,280
It's come out for another eight years, but yeah.

2718
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:23,360
Isn't it nice to know that it's being worked on?

2719
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:28,720
And I guess this is coming from Kazunori Yamauchi, who's the creator of the Gran Turismo franchise.

2720
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:33,540
He's the president of Polyphony Digital, and he actually, I guess, was at the Specialty

2721
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:37,760
Equipment Market Association industry trade show in Las Vegas, because where else do trade

2722
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:39,040
shows happen?

2723
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:42,800
And was talking a lot about some of the recent developments to Gran Turismo 5.

2724
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:47,920
They've done 15 updates to the game they were talking about, and that they are doing a DLC

2725
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:53,400
that just came out and so forth, and talking about feedback and blah blah blah blah blah.

2726
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:57,640
And somewhere in there, of course, we're working on Gran Turismo 6 already, and I think what

2727
02:14:57,640 --> 02:15:01,960
will really be the separating factor is something that we can't update through a DLC is something

2728
02:15:01,960 --> 02:15:05,400
that obviously has to be saved through Gran Turismo 6.

2729
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:11,640
Things that we can provide through DLC we will, so that's really the market difference.

2730
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:15,640
Maybe it'll be just in time for the PlayStation 4 launch.

2731
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:16,640
We'll see.

2732
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:21,160
Alright, we're going to go to the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use your name on Skype

2733
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:25,440
if you want to give us a call and talk about anything this week, or maybe something we've

2734
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,440
missed.

2735
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:27,440
Maybe you want to talk about modern warfare.

2736
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:30,880
Heck, lots of people are into modern warfare, I'd like to hear some comments on that.

2737
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:33,920
Maybe you want to talk about that Tumblr post we mentioned earlier, 13-year-olds playing

2738
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:34,920
M-rated games.

2739
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:38,640
Saints Row the Thirds dominate a lot of conversation night, or maybe have something else that you

2740
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:40,160
think needs a shout out.

2741
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:44,080
1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the US and Canada.

2742
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:48,240
For everybody else, you probably want to use Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word,

2743
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:49,240
on Skype.

2744
02:15:49,240 --> 02:15:51,480
Skype us, baby, Skype us.

2745
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:54,800
Meanwhile, just tell us, oh, it's so much fun.

2746
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:58,000
Twitter.com slash OLR, getting into some tweets tonight.

2747
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,160
We'll start off with a tweet from Rettertainment.

2748
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:05,580
Considering all the AAA games coming out in the next couple of weeks, I'm wondering if

2749
02:16:05,580 --> 02:16:08,680
there's a bank with good rates on credit cards.

2750
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:10,640
No, there is not.

2751
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:13,440
The answer to your question is no.

2752
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:17,060
I guess my real answer, even though I get the tongue-in-cheekness of your question,

2753
02:16:17,060 --> 02:16:19,660
the real answer would be, it depends on your credit score.

2754
02:16:19,660 --> 02:16:22,240
The all-important credit score is what's going to determine who's going to give you good

2755
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:23,240
rates.

2756
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:25,760
Because if your credit score is really bad, then the only way you're going to get a credit

2757
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:31,200
card is what's called a secured credit card, where you pay them $300 to give you a $300

2758
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:35,320
line of credit, and only when you've really established that you can pay bills on time

2759
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:39,880
will they give you that $300 back or offer you a card that's not secured.

2760
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:44,400
Or that you have something that's already attached to your bank account.

2761
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:46,360
So alright, we're going to go to the phones and take some calls.

2762
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:47,680
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2763
02:16:47,680 --> 02:16:48,680
Who's this?

2764
02:16:48,680 --> 02:16:49,680
Hey, this is X-Link.

2765
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:50,680
Hey, X-Link!

2766
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:51,680
What's on your mind, buddy?

2767
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:56,840
Hey, I just wanted to say, Modern Warfare 3 was pretty decent.

2768
02:16:56,840 --> 02:17:01,320
Actually, I'm not really all into first-person shooters, but I actually loved playing it.

2769
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:04,680
I was playing with a roommate of mine, and we loved playing the co-op.

2770
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:06,240
It was a lot of fun.

2771
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:07,240
What do you do in the game?

2772
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:10,360
Do you always go through and shoot terrorists in the face?

2773
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:13,200
Yeah, well, there's a co-op called...

2774
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:17,600
It's like a mission-type mode, where they give you different little missions to go through.

2775
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:19,560
And one of the favorite ones we were doing was...

2776
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:21,280
I can't think of the name of it right off the bat.

2777
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:25,960
I think it's the fifth or sixth one down, in the third or fourth mission, in the second

2778
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:28,440
tier set of missions.

2779
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:35,720
And basically, because I was the second player and my roommate was the first, and she was

2780
02:17:35,720 --> 02:17:42,960
the first player, you would actually try to get him off the base, but you're controlling

2781
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:45,720
the turrets that we're hacking into.

2782
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:49,640
So one person will play as the hacked turret, and basically you can sit there and mow down

2783
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:54,160
all the enemies as you're trying to get him to run through to the other side of the base.

2784
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:55,640
It was pretty decent.

2785
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:56,640
Excellent.

2786
02:17:56,640 --> 02:17:58,960
I'm actually really interested to hear that you're into this game, because I know you

2787
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:01,400
and I usually play a lot of the same types of games.

2788
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:05,080
We both play WoW an awful lot, in fact, way more than we probably should.

2789
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:10,040
We play a lot of the same type of puzzly games on Steam and so forth, but you are actually

2790
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:11,440
kind of jumping into Modern Warfare.

2791
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:16,160
Now, I, for one, am terrible at first-person shooters, so how hard is a game like Modern

2792
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:18,520
Warfare for someone like me?

2793
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:22,560
Personally, I suck at first-person shooters myself.

2794
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:26,480
I'm usually the one that's running into room full of 15 enemies and trying to mow them

2795
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:27,480
all down one time.

2796
02:18:27,480 --> 02:18:31,960
I'm basically the copycat of the noob from the commercial, basically, I'm just like running

2797
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:35,560
around and doing anything I pretty much could see, I don't really take my time lying behind

2798
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:39,160
walls and stuff.

2799
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:43,560
I guess I'm really bad at that, because I'm so used to, I guess, Grand Theft Auto on the

2800
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:44,560
end.

2801
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:45,560
Or Quake.

2802
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:46,560
That's how you play Quake.

2803
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:52,120
That will always be my favorite first-person shooter, is Quake, because there was no such

2804
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:53,120
thing as cover.

2805
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:58,600
Then again, like I said before, I take you back to Quake and stuff like that, and back

2806
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:03,240
to my days, like of course being a rogue, just going around and pretty much popping

2807
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:08,000
up behind people and killing them.

2808
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,760
I liked it, personally.

2809
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:14,840
I thought it was a lot of fun, the graphics were very cool to look at, it was very updated.

2810
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:19,440
The only thing that I got a problem with any of these games now is, they're always talking

2811
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:23,800
about making the next one, it's like how they're going to one-up what you did, seriously.

2812
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:28,920
I remember playing games and getting used to, say for example, Mario, going from Mario

2813
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:34,320
World to Mario 64 and seeing the graphics change, and seeing the process of evolution

2814
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:39,520
constantly going through, it's like, what's going to be, how far is it going to be from

2815
02:19:39,520 --> 02:19:44,360
now on before they hit that brick wall, so to speak, before they can't go any further

2816
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:45,360
than they do?

2817
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:48,920
We've been saying that ever since the Atari 2600.

2818
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:51,160
How are they going to make these games even more realistic?

2819
02:19:51,160 --> 02:19:53,840
And you know, we've always joked on Orange Launch Radio, everything is getting one step

2820
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:55,000
closer to the holodeck.

2821
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,360
Look, we now have games in 3D!

2822
02:19:57,360 --> 02:20:01,360
I mean, it's, the holodeck will be here in 20 years, baby!

2823
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:02,360
Get ready for it!

2824
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:03,360
You already have holograms!

2825
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:06,360
Besides, it's about being a wheelchair to holodeck, I don't want to be so old in the

2826
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:09,360
beginning, you're hardly new, but they'll be kind of interesting to see on the last

2827
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:10,360
day or so.

2828
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:13,040
Hey, if I can get in the holodeck in my wheelchair, I'm there!

2829
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:17,680
Well, Keith, the reason too is, because I know this is going to take a lot of people

2830
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:22,200
a shot, and I know because last week I called into Bobby's show and I was talking about

2831
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:27,960
Skyrim, and unfortunately because of the situation which you and Jamie are familiar with with

2832
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:30,880
my roommate, and I'm going to read all that on the show.

2833
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:31,880
Personal drama.

2834
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:33,880
We'll just say personal drama.

2835
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:40,920
Well, long story short, I got fucked over $1500 from my ex-roommate, bottom line.

2836
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:44,860
And that caused a lot of problems for me getting in, and unfortunately I was really looking

2837
02:20:44,860 --> 02:20:49,840
forward to Skyrim, I had it pre-ordered, I had a lot of money down on it, and unfortunately

2838
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:52,520
I just can't go to the last minute because of other priorities.

2839
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:57,760
So because of that, instead I went to Redbox, tried running like I could, unfortunately

2840
02:20:57,760 --> 02:21:02,240
I still wanted to play something a little more new, and of course Skyrim, I forgot I

2841
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:05,520
was being stupid, I go there on a Thursday, I'm like, okay, I'm going to go get Skyrim,

2842
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:11,220
not thinking that it came out the following day, and because of that I decided to get

2843
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:16,160
Modern Warfare 3, Modern Warfare 3 was the closest one around the corner, so I got that

2844
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:17,160
instead.

2845
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:21,840
Which was a little disappointed by anyone, because I was very blown away by it.

2846
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:25,760
Well you'll get to play Skyrim eventually, and you know, personal life stuff's more important,

2847
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:30,600
and unfortunately that whole situation's kind of crappy, but you'll get through it.

2848
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:35,600
So yeah, I will, and you know, I was very patient, I was the same way with Fallout,

2849
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:42,760
and though I really was kind of pissed at, when I did buy it, it was like two weeks later

2850
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:48,400
ago, they now sold Game of the Year edition, but then it was, they had all the DLC out,

2851
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:49,400
so.

2852
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:54,800
Yeah, I didn't play Fallout until I got that Game of the Year edition, like, used, so,

2853
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:56,360
you know, it was a long time.

2854
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:59,440
Alright, well X-Link, we ought to let you go, buddy, to get more calls.

2855
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:03,560
But thanks so much for calling in and telling us about Modern Warfare, take care, buddy.

2856
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:04,560
Oh, anytime.

2857
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:05,560
Anytime.

2858
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:06,560
Anytime.

2859
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:07,560
Bye bye.

2860
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:08,560
Later.

2861
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:11,960
1877 Game OLR, or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.

2862
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:18,440
He made Modern Warfare sound, basically it's pretty, you're oogling the prettiness, and

2863
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:21,320
then you shoot bad guys in the face.

2864
02:22:21,320 --> 02:22:27,900
Going to more tweets, twitter.com slash orange lounge, or excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR.

2865
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:29,600
We have a couple links from Tiger Claw.

2866
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:34,280
Oh yeah, the trailer, he linked us to the trailer for the Phoenix Wright live action

2867
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:35,280
movie.

2868
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:36,280
Did you guys see this?

2869
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:41,240
There's actually a trailer out there on the interwebs for the, it's pretty cool, yeah,

2870
02:22:41,240 --> 02:22:42,240
it's hilarious.

2871
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:44,680
Yeah, I think I saw some of this.

2872
02:22:44,680 --> 02:22:51,400
I will totally watch this, and they've even got the guy's hairs, alright.

2873
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:59,320
My favorite is, it's totally accurate.

2874
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:04,480
I love that they have the style from the games.

2875
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:08,080
I will totally watch it, that's going to be like 20 kinds of awesome.

2876
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:11,200
Oh, she's even wearing the thingy.

2877
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:13,520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2878
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:17,240
Hey, it's your one and only local convention whore, DJ Ron Ma S.

2879
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:20,600
Hey Ron Ma, what convention did you go to this time?

2880
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:23,280
Last weekend I found myself in the midwest at Yomacon.

2881
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:24,280
In the midwest?

2882
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:25,280
Yes.

2883
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:28,280
You poor thing, how'd you end up there?

2884
02:23:28,280 --> 02:23:32,960
Um, friends out there, and a girlfriend, what can I say?

2885
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:35,840
Oh, I see, you did it for pussy, it's alright.

2886
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:36,840
Alright.

2887
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:37,840
Oh!

2888
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:38,840
Wait!

2889
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:39,840
Rob, let me ask you something.

2890
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:45,600
What have you done for ass, okay?

2891
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:48,200
Okay?

2892
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:49,200
No comment, alright.

2893
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:50,200
Alright then!

2894
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:53,280
You're just as bad as a whore as me, okay?

2895
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:56,840
Hey, wait, no, no, no, I'm settled down now.

2896
02:23:56,840 --> 02:23:58,760
Those days are long behind me.

2897
02:23:58,760 --> 02:23:59,760
Same here.

2898
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:03,840
Alright, so anyhow, how was the con that you went to?

2899
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,840
It was fun.

2900
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:09,400
I mean, the best part is, is you look across the waterfront, you see Canada.

2901
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:10,400
Nice.

2902
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:15,360
You're like, oh, better places, alright.

2903
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:19,640
I didn't call to talk about the con, but there are two things I want to discuss, so I'll

2904
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:21,200
be on my merry little way.

2905
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:22,200
Okay.

2906
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:25,520
Number one, that story about Skyrim you read earlier?

2907
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:26,520
Yeah.

2908
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:27,520
I don't recall bullshit.

2909
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:31,080
Oh, the 13-year-old getting the game at midnight and so forth?

2910
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:35,240
If that was me, my mother would have tanned my hide and I'd be hanging from a tree right

2911
02:24:35,240 --> 02:24:36,240
now.

2912
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:41,180
But it's different from when you and I were growing up, Rama, the same way.

2913
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:44,040
My mother, oh my god, she would have lost her shit.

2914
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:47,520
She would have lost her shit, although she had me, she had such fear instilled in me

2915
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:51,100
that she had me convinced that there were like rabid dogs waiting outside to chew my

2916
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:53,680
face off if I ever tried to sneak out of the house.

2917
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:56,720
I mean, you know, she slept with one eye open.

2918
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:57,720
True.

2919
02:24:57,720 --> 02:25:03,040
But on the same token though, I mean, being in the schools for about a year, I don't really

2920
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:08,560
see these 12 and 13-year-olds being at a GameStop or at a Best Buy at midnight by themselves.

2921
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:12,680
If they're with friends picking up the game, that's believable.

2922
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:17,520
But by yourself on a bike, I don't see that.

2923
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:20,880
I'm going to go ask Dan how many 13-year-olds showed up at his midnight releases.

2924
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:22,880
I'll be right back.

2925
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:25,840
Dark Soccer's for an M-rated game.

2926
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:28,880
All right, you know, what was the other thing you wanted to mention?

2927
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:34,080
I wanted to pick at Loki for a comment he said last week.

2928
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:35,080
Okay.

2929
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:37,240
Loki has to pay for something he said last week.

2930
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:38,240
What's that?

2931
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:40,200
His comment about Skylanders.

2932
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:41,200
Okay.

2933
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:47,560
I mean, I understand where he's coming from about how silly the game is, how kids want

2934
02:25:47,560 --> 02:25:50,880
their parents to get that game.

2935
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:52,960
Don't divulge too much information.

2936
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:58,240
I understand where he's coming from with that, but on the same token, we were young.

2937
02:25:58,240 --> 02:25:59,240
We were kids.

2938
02:25:59,240 --> 02:26:02,600
We did the same thing to our parents, so I don't, I mean, he's going to be doing the

2939
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:06,720
same thing in a few years when his son wants a silly game like that, and he's going to

2940
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:09,380
be like, here you go, son.

2941
02:26:09,380 --> 02:26:15,640
So I asked Dan how many 13-year-olds he saw at midnight releases for M-rated games, and

2942
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:18,080
the reply was, a few.

2943
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:19,080
Okay.

2944
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:20,080
Wow.

2945
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,080
Okay.

2946
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:22,080
With their parents or no?

2947
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:25,040
Do we find that out, do you think, without?

2948
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:28,100
And no, I won't be doing that for my son, because I'm not going to buy him stupid shit

2949
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:30,360
like that.

2950
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:32,080
All the games have to pass the dad test.

2951
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:33,080
Hell no.

2952
02:26:33,080 --> 02:26:37,040
He won't be playing crappy games like Skylanders, please.

2953
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:42,400
But I mean, if he plays the demo and he likes it, I mean, if that's what he wants for Christmas-

2954
02:26:42,400 --> 02:26:46,940
How's he going to play a demo for a game that requires some stupid portal of power for some

2955
02:26:46,940 --> 02:26:47,940
crappy-

2956
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:48,940
Then he's grounded.

2957
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:54,520
Say for example, because my girlfriend's kid, he wants it, so she's getting it for him.

2958
02:26:54,520 --> 02:26:59,440
I have to hear what Loki had to say about it, I was like, well, if that's what he wants,

2959
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:00,440
that's what he wants.

2960
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:04,360
He'll learn better if it's a good game or not.

2961
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:09,240
I have no problem if he wants to play, you know, like a Connectamals or something like

2962
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:10,240
that.

2963
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:14,540
That's a regular game, may not be something that I'm necessarily looking for.

2964
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:23,400
But a game that promotes the whoring out of children to buy, you know, crappy toys, which

2965
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:26,600
by the way, they keep putting out more toys, because they're going to just add patches

2966
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:30,180
to the game so that more toys are compatible with it.

2967
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:36,640
And so yeah, it's basically just getting kids to beg their parents to buy them toys.

2968
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:37,720
And you know what?

2969
02:27:37,720 --> 02:27:40,800
Parents are dumb enough to buy them their toys, and Activision deserves the money that

2970
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:42,120
they're getting from them.

2971
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:47,200
But I'm smart enough to go, no, it's a toy that doesn't do anything, how about I buy

2972
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:48,640
you a cooler toy instead?

2973
02:27:48,640 --> 02:27:50,200
And he'll be like, okay.

2974
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:51,760
You know what my rule is?

2975
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:53,880
No TV until you're five.

2976
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:54,880
I'm serious.

2977
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:56,200
I'm dead serious.

2978
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:58,720
Try having a kid, that's not gonna happen.

2979
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:02,920
I know plenty of parents who have been completely successful with not having their kids.

2980
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:05,920
You're gonna run out of things to do with them.

2981
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:06,920
That's okay.

2982
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:11,520
I would rather them not have, you know, be psychologically dependent on TV.

2983
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:13,840
They're not dependent on it, but sometimes TV helps.

2984
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:16,520
And I don't want to be, I don't care.

2985
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:17,520
Anyway.

2986
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:18,520
That doesn't matter to me.

2987
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:19,520
None of that matters to me.

2988
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:21,560
Let me get back to the caller.

2989
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:28,600
So Rama, you're giving into the Skylanders stuff for the sake of this kid who just wants

2990
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:29,600
it.

2991
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:31,560
So Rama, did you buy one of the Tony Hawk ride boards?

2992
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:35,920
Because it was a cool little peripheral that they had for Tony Hawk, and then you like

2993
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:39,040
supporting Activision, so did you buy one of those?

2994
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:41,040
Does it look like I have $80?

2995
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:45,080
Oh, well, then why should we be supporting this kind of bullshit?

2996
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:51,280
Well, then again, it's not my money, but like I said, if he really wanted it, I'm gonna

2997
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:55,480
be like, fine, you can have this, but I'd be damned if you're getting the rest of them.

2998
02:28:55,480 --> 02:28:59,080
If you want the rest of them, you could miss your friends to get different ones that you

2999
02:28:59,080 --> 02:29:00,360
guys trade off.

3000
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:03,200
But daddy, I want a golden goose now!

3001
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:08,640
But daddy, I want the goose that lays the golden eggs now!

3002
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:13,320
If you start talking that type of attitude, I will take my belt off right there in Toys

3003
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:14,320
R Us.

3004
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:16,200
Oh, and I will go to town on him.

3005
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:17,760
You best believe that.

3006
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:22,620
He can have the game when it gets into the bargain bin like March, because that's pretty

3007
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:24,520
much when it's gonna die out.

3008
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:25,520
Alright.

3009
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:31,640
Alright, Rama, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but thank you for the lively discussion.

3010
02:29:31,640 --> 02:29:37,040
And one thing, Loki, I want you to know, I've taken notes on some of this, so I know what

3011
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:38,760
to look forward to when my time comes.

3012
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:40,720
Oh no, he's taken notes!

3013
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:41,720
I'm shaaaaken!

3014
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:46,360
No, I mean it in a good way, dude.

3015
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:49,840
He means, he means, I think he means for when he has his bebe.

3016
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:50,840
Yes.

3017
02:29:50,840 --> 02:29:51,840
Alright.

3018
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:53,440
Alright, have a good one, Rama.

3019
02:29:53,440 --> 02:29:54,440
You too.

3020
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:55,440
Later.

3021
02:29:55,440 --> 02:29:59,160
See, Loki took that to mean, like, taking notes, like, I'm writing down everything you

3022
02:29:59,160 --> 02:30:02,160
say.

3023
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:06,640
Tigerclaw sends us another tweet, uh, 1-877-GAMEL-LR, username on skype is orange-sawns-radio if

3024
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:07,640
you wanna call us.

3025
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:12,960
Uh, Tigerclaw sends us another tweet, apparently, uh, Battlefield Ban Hammer going out left

3026
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:13,960
and right.

3027
02:30:13,960 --> 02:30:21,560
EA has, I guess, doled out hundreds of bannings in Battlefield 3 and they say they will hand

3028
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:22,760
out more.

3029
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:28,200
If they wanna boost XP and so forth, they're gonna ban more and more and more.

3030
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:32,380
Um, they've said on Twitter, we banned hundreds of hackers this week alone and we're determined

3031
02:30:32,380 --> 02:30:35,200
to punish the players who play without integrity.

3032
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:37,600
Well, hold on, hold on.

3033
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:38,600
Alright.

3034
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:39,600
Hackers.

3035
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:41,000
They're calling them hackers.

3036
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:47,200
They used the glitch that was in the game because Battlefield 3 wasn't properly tested.

3037
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:50,200
So perhaps a better term would have been the exploiters.

3038
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:52,180
Sure, whatever.

3039
02:30:52,180 --> 02:30:53,400
It's a part of the game.

3040
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:58,640
If it's a glitch that you leave in your game, then you should not be punishing these guys.

3041
02:30:58,640 --> 02:30:59,640
Here's the rest of a comment.

3042
02:30:59,640 --> 02:31:03,180
A patch is just around the corner and we will continue to ban cheaters.

3043
02:31:03,180 --> 02:31:04,440
We take it seriously.

3044
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:06,480
That is our attitude here at Battlefield.

3045
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:11,320
We have zero tolerance for cheating players and are banning more all of the time.

3046
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:12,320
Let's go to the phones.

3047
02:31:12,320 --> 02:31:13,320
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

3048
02:31:13,320 --> 02:31:14,320
Who's this?

3049
02:31:14,320 --> 02:31:15,320
Hello.

3050
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:16,320
This is Amiga777.

3051
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:17,320
Hello, Amiga777.

3052
02:31:17,320 --> 02:31:18,320
What's on your mind, buddy?

3053
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:30,120
Well, um, I know there's been a lot of talk lately about the PSN hacks, the Xbox Live

3054
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:32,000
hacks, and all that type of stuff.

3055
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:36,080
Yep, hackers gonna hack.

3056
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:43,880
So I guess one other thing to add to that is I guess that's recently some Facebook hackings.

3057
02:31:43,880 --> 02:31:45,960
Facebook hackings going on.

3058
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:47,960
What's going on on Facebook?

3059
02:31:47,960 --> 02:31:59,040
Well, um, about, what's that, today, um, I found out about some, uh, thing that was going

3060
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:00,040
on.

3061
02:32:00,040 --> 02:32:10,080
There was a, uh, a link from someone in chat and, uh, I guess it was something about, you

3062
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:17,480
know, like a gross video that nobody has ever really gone past it for 15 seconds.

3063
02:32:17,480 --> 02:32:20,200
Oh, I've kind of, I've kind of seen similar things before.

3064
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:23,400
Like it says like, uh, like I got a Twitter spam like this one.

3065
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:27,520
Somebody tweeted me and it said, Oh my God, they're talking shit about you on this blog.

3066
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:28,580
Click here to read it.

3067
02:32:28,580 --> 02:32:32,860
And I, of course I had that skeptical side eye look at it, but it sounds like, like Facebook's

3068
02:32:32,860 --> 02:32:34,360
getting something of the equivalent of that.

3069
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:36,640
Like you watch this video.

3070
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:37,640
It's really gross.

3071
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:39,160
It'll usually be something like in the UK.

3072
02:32:39,160 --> 02:32:42,680
I had one of those one time that click, it was like, here's a video of something blah,

3073
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:43,680
blah, blah.

3074
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:44,680
And you click on it.

3075
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:49,440
And then I realized immediately what it was and I saw that it posted something to my board.

3076
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:53,240
So I blocked it and then I deleted the post and that was it.

3077
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:57,700
But some people, not everybody's so fast on the, yeah, because if, if you, it posts it

3078
02:32:57,700 --> 02:33:01,160
to yours and then your friend will see that and they'll, they'll post it and then so on

3079
02:33:01,160 --> 02:33:02,160
so forth.

3080
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:03,160
So what happened to me?

3081
02:33:03,160 --> 02:33:05,200
Go, did you, did you accidentally fall for this?

3082
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:14,160
Unfortunately, yes, I, you know, probably these instructions is like a three of them.

3083
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:20,240
Um, not really knowing exactly what was in store, you know, putting this, uh, here's

3084
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:21,240
my question.

3085
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:24,600
What, what, what were they advertising in the video that made you want to click it?

3086
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:28,480
Was it like, see big boobies now click on this link?

3087
02:33:28,480 --> 02:33:36,360
I said it was this really, uh, like nasty video that they were saying, um, it had like

3088
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:44,480
this image of the back of this person's neck with this really large, you know, nasty zit

3089
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:46,680
on the back or something like that.

3090
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:47,680
Gross.

3091
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:51,120
So yeah, you just, oh, you just, you're, you're into like gross stuff.

3092
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:58,240
Mine was a celebrity sex tape, so of course, you know, just tried to check it out and then,

3093
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:03,400
uh, you know, and then that, and then it asked me to do this little survey thing and I was

3094
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:08,960
like, I don't want to do a survey and I didn't sign out of that.

3095
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:11,400
I want to see the gross things on people's necks.

3096
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:13,600
I don't want to see a survey.

3097
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:14,600
I want the boobies.

3098
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:15,600
I have Shermie.

3099
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:19,480
I already see gross, gross shit, literally.

3100
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:24,040
So moral of the story, watch what you click on on Facebook because some of that stuff

3101
02:34:24,040 --> 02:34:26,680
is like apps and who knows what.

3102
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:27,680
Yeah.

3103
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:28,680
Right.

3104
02:34:28,680 --> 02:34:34,320
And then the kicker after that, um, was it like a few seconds later, a few of my friends

3105
02:34:34,320 --> 02:34:40,560
from Ted is like, um, why are you linking me with this, um, you know, a testament?

3106
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:47,520
I just found out that, you know, um, this, uh, this thing after I, I just did whatever

3107
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:54,000
it told me it ended up, uh, spreading the, uh, attachment, uh, message across all my

3108
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,000
other friends.

3109
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:59,000
And so I hated that.

3110
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:06,240
And so I ended up just saying, you know what, again, I'm just gonna, uh, close up my Facebook

3111
02:35:06,240 --> 02:35:11,760
account and whatnot and, uh, change my password and that type of stuff.

3112
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:12,760
That's probably for the best.

3113
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:16,480
If you get hacked like that, you definitely want to close it up and delete all the crap

3114
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:19,160
and, uh, change your password as soon as you can.

3115
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:22,000
So some good tips for the listeners of Orange Lawns Radio.

3116
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,800
Be careful what you click on.

3117
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:25,800
So all right.

3118
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:27,800
Stick, stick to the port site, you know?

3119
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:28,800
Okay.

3120
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:29,800
All right.

3121
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:30,800
Amiga77, we're gonna let you go buddy so we can get another call.

3122
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:31,800
Take care.

3123
02:35:31,800 --> 02:35:32,800
Okay.

3124
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:33,800
All right.

3125
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:34,800
Bye.

3126
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:37,160
Be careful what you click on and see Microsoft would have you believe that that's how your

3127
02:35:37,160 --> 02:35:39,080
Xbox is getting hacked, but we'll see.

3128
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:40,080
All right.

3129
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:41,080
We got another call on the line.

3130
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:42,080
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

3131
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:43,080
Who's this?

3132
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:44,080
Hello?

3133
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:45,080
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

3134
02:35:45,080 --> 02:35:46,080
Who's this?

3135
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:47,480
Hey, wait a minute.

3136
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:48,920
I got a lag going on here.

3137
02:35:48,920 --> 02:35:49,920
One second.

3138
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:50,920
Okay.

3139
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:51,920
We'll wait.

3140
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:52,920
It's cool.

3141
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:53,920
Yeah.

3142
02:35:53,920 --> 02:35:54,920
Sorry about that.

3143
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:55,920
I had the show running while I was waiting for you to pick up.

3144
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:56,920
All right.

3145
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:57,920
Okay.

3146
02:35:57,920 --> 02:35:58,920
Who's this?

3147
02:35:58,920 --> 02:35:59,920
This is, uh, Kaijuto.

3148
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:00,920
Hey, Kaijuto.

3149
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:01,920
What's on your mind?

3150
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:02,920
Not much.

3151
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:03,920
I'm just calling to cover a few things.

3152
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:04,920
First off, I want to say thanks for my prize.

3153
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:05,920
I finally got it.

3154
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:08,600
I know we were kind of late in sending it, but yeah, we got it.

3155
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:09,600
Don't even worry about that.

3156
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:10,600
I was just calling to say thanks.

3157
02:36:10,600 --> 02:36:15,720
I mean, I wasn't gonna rub it in or say, you know, you took forever or anything like that.

3158
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:19,640
We took until we finally got another eBay shipment out where we, we just sent it along

3159
02:36:19,640 --> 02:36:20,720
with the eBay stuff.

3160
02:36:20,720 --> 02:36:23,960
So yeah, you can kind of thank Salacious Pop for getting on me with that.

3161
02:36:23,960 --> 02:36:30,640
So are you enjoying your Chinese pirate version of, of, uh, uh, what, what, oh, Child of Eden.

3162
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:34,840
It's Child of Eden, but not really, it was, um, uh, Assassin's Creed.

3163
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:37,720
I know, but we bought Child of Eden and that's what we got.

3164
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:44,040
And the funny thing was, uh, one of you put on the back of it, uh, your mom and let's

3165
02:36:44,040 --> 02:36:47,560
open the package.

3166
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:50,640
Do you remember when, when I got that fake, uh, it was Assassin's Creed.

3167
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:52,280
No, I didn't hear what he said.

3168
02:36:52,280 --> 02:36:53,280
Oh, he is.

3169
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:56,480
One of you signed it, your mom and my mom opened the package.

3170
02:36:56,480 --> 02:37:00,080
Oh, there you go.

3171
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:01,080
Yeah.

3172
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:05,480
But, um, uh, another thing I want to get to is, uh, you mentioned earlier, um, I'm not

3173
02:37:05,480 --> 02:37:06,800
an Xbox fan boy.

3174
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:07,800
I'm just a gamer.

3175
02:37:07,800 --> 02:37:08,800
I love all the systems.

3176
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:12,520
Uh, you mentioned before that, uh, you couldn't get your, you couldn't remove your credit

3177
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:14,280
card from Xbox live.

3178
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:15,280
Yeah.

3179
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:16,280
Uh, you can actually do it.

3180
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:19,320
You just have to call in and have them remove it.

3181
02:37:19,320 --> 02:37:23,040
I just, I, I, I just hate that I have to do that.

3182
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:27,480
Like I hate that they're allowed to make it so easy to give it to them and then it's not

3183
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:28,880
as easy to take it away.

3184
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:33,160
I mean, I get the business side of it and everything, but just after everything I've

3185
02:37:33,160 --> 02:37:38,600
been through with that company, it's, it's, it's like, I'm almost insulted that they would

3186
02:37:38,600 --> 02:37:42,280
like make me go through that after, you know, getting hacked and all that stuff.

3187
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:45,880
But you know, yeah, that's probably what I'll end up doing is I'll call them and get it

3188
02:37:45,880 --> 02:37:46,880
taken off that way.

3189
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:50,600
But it just, I guess my point is at the end of the day, it just sucks that I have to do

3190
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:51,600
that.

3191
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:55,160
Why can't I take it off the account as easy as I was able to put it on the account?

3192
02:37:55,160 --> 02:37:56,160
Yeah.

3193
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:59,280
The other, the other weird thing about it is if you do want to like remove it, like,

3194
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:03,960
you know, like, uh, midway through your, um, you know, through your billing cycle, they,

3195
02:38:03,960 --> 02:38:06,800
uh, they tell you that you'll lose your Xbox live.

3196
02:38:06,800 --> 02:38:11,960
Like you can have the car removed, but you'll lose whatever that amount of weeks or amount

3197
02:38:11,960 --> 02:38:13,640
of days that you have left on goal.

3198
02:38:13,640 --> 02:38:16,060
And my opinion, that's kind of bullshit too.

3199
02:38:16,060 --> 02:38:17,840
Like that's a real problem I have with it.

3200
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:20,720
So you're not really getting the card off your account.

3201
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:24,520
You're telling them that you want to cancel and they're going to cancel you because you

3202
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:27,020
don't want to keep a credit card on file with them.

3203
02:38:27,020 --> 02:38:30,840
And you already paid for it at the beginning of the year when there's proof that that credit

3204
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:34,520
card information is being exploited and they just don't want to admit it.

3205
02:38:34,520 --> 02:38:36,120
That pisses me off.

3206
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:37,120
It's crazy.

3207
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:38,120
That's what I'm going through now.

3208
02:38:38,120 --> 02:38:41,680
I had to, uh, I spoke with someone and they had to, they all, you also have to call them

3209
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:44,040
to have the automatic renewal removed.

3210
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:47,320
So I call to say that I wanted the renewal removed.

3211
02:38:47,320 --> 02:38:51,480
And when my subscription is up, I want, uh, you know, I want the card removed and then

3212
02:38:51,480 --> 02:38:53,940
I'll just pay through whatever that is.

3213
02:38:53,940 --> 02:38:59,280
Now supposedly the automatic renewal is all, you're able to do that on the website because

3214
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:02,440
that was part of the big upgrades they did this week that Jamie was talking about earlier

3215
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:06,400
is that, you know, you can turn that automatic renewal off and I did see that switch.

3216
02:39:06,400 --> 02:39:10,600
So that has changed recently as in like the past week, week and a half.

3217
02:39:10,600 --> 02:39:13,800
But as far as the credit cards go, I went in there and I saw a place where you could

3218
02:39:13,800 --> 02:39:15,920
click remove to remove the credit card.

3219
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:20,040
But when I tried to do that, it said, Oh, you can't do that because you're using that

3220
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:25,120
card to pay for your one month of Xbox live that you used a card for.

3221
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:27,200
Not a credit card, but like a, a over the counter card.

3222
02:39:27,200 --> 02:39:28,480
I was like, what?

3223
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:34,320
So two other quick things and then I'll let you get to some more calls.

3224
02:39:34,320 --> 02:39:38,560
Um, the, the saints row, when I mentioned, uh, was it a, did they improve from saints

3225
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:39,560
row too?

3226
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:44,800
Uh, the thing I was talking about with the camera was I remember in saints row too, um,

3227
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:49,640
they didn't have a, you know, like a GTA four, you have like three different, uh, I think

3228
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:50,640
camera angles you can do.

3229
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:55,120
You can be like up close, you could be like midway and then like really far back saints

3230
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:56,120
row too.

3231
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:57,120
Didn't have any of that.

3232
02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:01,360
It was like your character was always in the way of your, um, your little, uh, your little

3233
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:02,360
rectical thing.

3234
02:40:02,360 --> 02:40:04,000
You know what I'm talking about?

3235
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:05,600
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

3236
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:06,600
Yeah.

3237
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:07,600
Yeah.

3238
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:08,600
Yeah.

3239
02:40:08,600 --> 02:40:11,760
And that really killed it for me because I couldn't see what I was shooting at and especially

3240
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:12,760
a multiplayer.

3241
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:17,340
I know they don't have multiplayer anymore, but it was really hard to, uh, play multiplayer

3242
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:19,920
when your character is like so blown up in front of you like that.

3243
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:20,920
I had difficulty.

3244
02:40:20,920 --> 02:40:23,640
I never really had that problem, but I mean, I don't know.

3245
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:30,360
Um, yeah, I don't think they have, uh, any sort of way you can adjust.

3246
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:33,440
I think your camera, you might be able to adjust your camera distance.

3247
02:40:33,440 --> 02:40:39,920
Um, I'm trying to look here real quick, uh, vehicle camera stamp instant.

3248
02:40:39,920 --> 02:40:40,920
Yeah.

3249
02:40:40,920 --> 02:40:43,960
I don't know if they have a way to adjust the camera.

3250
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:45,960
Uh, well, here we go.

3251
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:49,400
Here's, uh, no, I don't see a way to adjust the camera.

3252
02:40:49,400 --> 02:40:56,040
Oh no, there is, I guess the, you know, you can manually adjust it, but, um, yeah, I will

3253
02:40:56,040 --> 02:41:00,360
find it, you know, as really a problem being in the way cause you do have the Amy rectangle

3254
02:41:00,360 --> 02:41:01,360
on the screen.

3255
02:41:01,360 --> 02:41:05,600
So, uh, yeah, you can see where you're shooting at.

3256
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:09,000
And you know, do you remember playing Saints Row 2?

3257
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,520
Like how long ago was it?

3258
02:41:10,520 --> 02:41:12,360
Cause I mean, I haven't played it.

3259
02:41:12,360 --> 02:41:13,360
I got that game.

3260
02:41:13,360 --> 02:41:14,360
I'm not even kidding.

3261
02:41:14,360 --> 02:41:19,000
Um, I got Saints Row 2 the first day it came out and I maybe played it for two weeks and

3262
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:23,760
I haven't played it since, since the original year that came out.

3263
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:29,040
That the driving in the, in that closeup camera just really screwed the game up for me.

3264
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:32,720
I never really had trouble with the camera at all, I don't remember the driving being

3265
02:41:32,720 --> 02:41:33,720
too bad.

3266
02:41:33,720 --> 02:41:41,560
I mean, um, I played that game to almost 100% and I played Saints Row 1 all the way to 100%.

3267
02:41:41,560 --> 02:41:47,720
Um, I just, and that's including the three DLCs for the second game as well.

3268
02:41:47,720 --> 02:41:50,160
But um, yeah, I don't remember it being a problem.

3269
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:54,280
I don't know, this one doesn't seem to be a problem so far and I'm about 40% through?

3270
02:41:54,280 --> 02:41:58,440
Yeah, I'm still, yeah, I'm still gonna get three just with everything it has in it.

3271
02:41:58,440 --> 02:42:00,640
But um, just curious about that and that's it.

3272
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:04,160
Plus I can only take screenshots in the game, which is pretty awesome.

3273
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:06,640
You can upload them to the saintsrow.com site.

3274
02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:10,960
I really wish I did that when I saw Professor Genki shooting rockets at pedestrians and

3275
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:13,680
I was like, whoa, what's that?

3276
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:14,680
That's different.

3277
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:17,400
Yeah, and I'm not, I'm not going to miss multiplayer in this one.

3278
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:21,680
This is like the one game that I'm like, the one game that they removed multiplayer where

3279
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:26,040
I'm like, I have no problem with that cause that multiplayer, I have to, I hate to admit

3280
02:42:26,040 --> 02:42:27,520
it was, it was terrible for me.

3281
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:28,520
It could have been better.

3282
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:29,520
They could have fixed it.

3283
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:30,520
All right.

3284
02:42:30,520 --> 02:42:31,520
That's it.

3285
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:32,520
I've been playing Skyrim.

3286
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:33,720
It's a great game.

3287
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:34,720
We all know that.

3288
02:42:34,720 --> 02:42:35,720
Yep.

3289
02:42:35,720 --> 02:42:36,840
Anyone who hasn't picked it up, pick it up.

3290
02:42:36,840 --> 02:42:37,840
I'm freaking loving it.

3291
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:38,840
It's a good time.

3292
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:39,840
And you guys have a nice night.

3293
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:40,840
All right.

3294
02:42:40,840 --> 02:42:41,840
Thanks again for the prize.

3295
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:42,840
Hey, no problem.

3296
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:43,840
Enjoy your bootleg copy.

3297
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:44,840
All right.

3298
02:42:44,840 --> 02:42:45,840
Take care.

3299
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:46,840
Bye.

3300
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:47,840
All right.

3301
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:48,840
That's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

3302
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:49,840
Good calls tonight.

3303
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:50,840
Thanks you guys.

3304
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:53,600
To those that didn't get through, I'm very sorry, but did you catch the part where we

3305
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:55,160
said we had no emails this week?

3306
02:42:55,160 --> 02:42:57,760
No, one, we had one that came in right before the show.

3307
02:42:57,760 --> 02:42:59,960
So you should write down your thoughts and we'll read them next week.

3308
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:05,560
Mailbag at orangeontraday.com or you can tweet us at twitter.com slash O L R. All right.

3309
02:43:05,560 --> 02:43:08,880
In the meantime, I need to finish up just a couple of tweets here that we had, um, dark

3310
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:13,920
Tetsuya tweeted us and said, so the DDR freak thing is still sort of happening in Milpitas

3311
02:43:13,920 --> 02:43:14,920
road trip.

3312
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:15,920
Oh yeah.

3313
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:16,920
I heard about that.

3314
02:43:16,920 --> 02:43:19,120
I got a Facebook invite for that today.

3315
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:22,840
Uh, maybe.

3316
02:43:22,840 --> 02:43:24,440
I don't know.

3317
02:43:24,440 --> 02:43:25,440
It's kind of one of those.

3318
02:43:25,440 --> 02:43:26,440
We have a show.

3319
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:27,440
I don't know.

3320
02:43:27,440 --> 02:43:28,440
We'll see.

3321
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:32,240
Um, I'd like to go, but it just might be too last minute for me.

3322
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:36,960
I got something else going on next week into, uh, act deaf to last tweet tonight, sequence

3323
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:39,440
that rhythm RPG game for cheap.

3324
02:43:39,440 --> 02:43:46,800
If enough users subscribe to the page game getter, uh, getter dot G forums.net.

3325
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:52,800
I guess, uh, I guess if so many people subscribe to this page, you can get the game even cheaper.

3326
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:53,800
Interesting.

3327
02:43:53,800 --> 02:43:57,400
Interesting way to do it.

3328
02:43:57,400 --> 02:43:58,400
But it's not, Oh yeah.

3329
02:43:58,400 --> 02:43:59,960
No, you get a steam code for it.

3330
02:43:59,960 --> 02:44:02,200
That's pretty cool.

3331
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:06,680
I see it's a getter dot G dash forums.net.

3332
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:09,280
It's a look at the tweets to OLR.

3333
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:13,200
Cause right now the game usually costs five bucks and right now it's down to three bucks

3334
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:17,480
because 101 people have subscribed, but what are you subscribing to?

3335
02:44:17,480 --> 02:44:20,520
I've got to be careful.

3336
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:22,240
Hopefully you're not subscribing to spam.

3337
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:23,240
All right.

3338
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:24,240
So that does it for tweets tonight.

3339
02:44:24,240 --> 02:44:27,240
Uh, let me go around quickly and see if there's any last minute stories.

3340
02:44:27,240 --> 02:44:29,720
I think we'd covered everything, but I'll check with Loki real quick.

3341
02:44:29,720 --> 02:44:30,880
Loki, any last minute stories tonight?

3342
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:31,880
Oh yeah.

3343
02:44:31,880 --> 02:44:32,880
I was going to talk a few things.

3344
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:38,120
Um, of course, St. Siro, um, and it just happened.

3345
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:39,920
These are some of the stories we just didn't talk about.

3346
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:43,760
Uh, the initiation station had a hundred, 1 million characters upload to it.

3347
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:44,760
So it's pretty awesome.

3348
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:45,760
That's one of the cool things about the games.

3349
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:49,440
You can actually download characters that people make, including, uh, itagaki is one

3350
02:44:49,440 --> 02:44:50,840
of the characters that you can download.

3351
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:51,840
Nice.

3352
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:52,840
So that's pretty cool.

3353
02:44:52,840 --> 02:44:58,080
Um, and my character, cause I put it up there so you can search for orange lounge, uh, and

3354
02:44:58,080 --> 02:45:02,640
then of course, uh, the season pass, the first season pass has been announced and this includes

3355
02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:04,640
the DLC release.

3356
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:06,840
The first three DLCs that are going to be coming out.

3357
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:12,080
And uh, you know, if you ordered this game off of THQ, uh, their store, you actually

3358
02:45:12,080 --> 02:45:13,080
got it free.

3359
02:45:13,080 --> 02:45:19,880
Um, and in the season pass, we'll save you 15% off of buying the DLC, uh, separately.

3360
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:25,560
And so what it includes is, uh, Genki bowl seven, which is supposed to be coming out

3361
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:27,080
in January.

3362
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:31,400
And the description is the wild world of Genki takes over steel port in a sporting tradition.

3363
02:45:31,400 --> 02:45:35,120
Totally under totally and utterly unlike anything else.

3364
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:42,440
Uh, and this is why I was laughing before gangsters in space is the second, uh, DLC

3365
02:45:42,440 --> 02:45:48,760
the coming winter, 2012, the saints go intergalactic in the science fiction misadventure.

3366
02:45:48,760 --> 02:45:52,460
And then the last one is the trouble with clones.

3367
02:45:52,460 --> 02:45:58,320
And that's coming spring at 2012 and says a copycat killing at its finest.

3368
02:45:58,320 --> 02:46:03,440
And also it includes the night blade DLC, which includes, uh, and night blade is one

3369
02:46:03,440 --> 02:46:09,040
of the fictional, like, you know, uh, blade characters in it.

3370
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:15,840
And um, the night blade mobile, which is a motor or a car, altar boy outfit, bloody,

3371
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:20,560
uh, Kenanis outfit and the bloody Kenanis bike.

3372
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:25,880
And those are, um, you know, through the season pass, you'll get that stuff, which I believe

3373
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:28,760
is 20 bucks.

3374
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:35,600
And then, uh, of course, uh, we talked a little bit about, uh, some cool streaming of, uh,

3375
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:38,880
game demos on YouTube.

3376
02:46:38,880 --> 02:46:45,040
And of course now there's one for, uh, dead rising to naked stream three year web browser

3377
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:55,320
using, uh, Gaikai and, uh, I don't believe it's on YouTube, but, uh, let's see here.

3378
02:46:55,320 --> 02:47:04,560
Capcom unity had a link to it and I believe it's actually, uh, yeah, it's on through Gaikai.com.

3379
02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:06,840
So you go there, you can check it out.

3380
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:08,000
It's a 30 minute demo.

3381
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:09,280
That's pretty awesome.

3382
02:47:09,280 --> 02:47:10,280
Wow.

3383
02:47:10,280 --> 02:47:14,360
That's a, that's that same site that had the, um, uh, FIFA demo that we talked about a couple

3384
02:47:14,360 --> 02:47:15,360
of weeks ago.

3385
02:47:15,360 --> 02:47:16,360
Yeah.

3386
02:47:16,360 --> 02:47:17,360
Nice.

3387
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:18,360
Very cool.

3388
02:47:18,360 --> 02:47:19,360
All right.

3389
02:47:19,360 --> 02:47:20,360
Excuse me.

3390
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:21,680
Is that it for the stories?

3391
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:22,680
All right.

3392
02:47:22,680 --> 02:47:25,120
I'm looking at these leaked, uh, leaked costumes.

3393
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:26,120
Yeah.

3394
02:47:26,120 --> 02:47:27,120
I saw that from hit stun.

3395
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:31,200
It had posted a link in chat for the, uh, ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three download

3396
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:32,200
costumes.

3397
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:33,200
Yeah.

3398
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:34,200
There's like a weapon X Wolverine.

3399
02:47:34,200 --> 02:47:35,200
Nice.

3400
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:36,200
That's pretty cool.

3401
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:39,720
Um, one of a beautiful Joe out of costume.

3402
02:47:39,720 --> 02:47:43,680
I'm so glad now in retrospect that we didn't buy Marvel versus Capcom three now that there's

3403
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:45,280
the ultimate one that's coming up.

3404
02:47:45,280 --> 02:47:46,960
I bought it, but you know, I'm cool.

3405
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:48,480
Oh, there's one of what's her face.

3406
02:47:48,480 --> 02:47:53,360
Um, the other chick from devil may cry with the white hair.

3407
02:47:53,360 --> 02:47:54,360
Nice.

3408
02:47:54,360 --> 02:47:55,360
Very cool.

3409
02:47:55,360 --> 02:47:56,360
All right.

3410
02:47:56,360 --> 02:47:57,360
Well that's going to do it for another episode of orange.

3411
02:47:57,360 --> 02:47:58,360
Oh God.

3412
02:47:58,360 --> 02:48:00,600
The worst ever character.

3413
02:48:00,600 --> 02:48:07,080
Oh, um, there's one of iron Patriot who was a character that had during the whole civil

3414
02:48:07,080 --> 02:48:08,680
war thing.

3415
02:48:08,680 --> 02:48:11,840
And then, um, but this is actually pretty cool.

3416
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:14,640
It's a clone Spidey, the Ben Riley Spidey.

3417
02:48:14,640 --> 02:48:15,640
All right.

3418
02:48:15,640 --> 02:48:16,640
We got to wrap it up.

3419
