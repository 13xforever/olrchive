[SPEAKER_08]: Say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:01:05,286 --> 00:01:05,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

10
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:06,527
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you, Jamie?

11
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:07,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy.

12
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:08,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy.

13
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:10,210
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

14
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,492
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

15
00:01:12,592 --> 00:01:15,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Joining us in just a few moments is Techmaster Loki.

16
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:16,995
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a little late to studio tonight.

17
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm literally listening to him walk in right this second.

18
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:21,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

19
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:24,840
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like to hear a little more about that excuse as to why he's running late.

20
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,841
[SPEAKER_08]: He's getting situated right now.

21
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:26,802
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come back to him in a minute.

22
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:27,062
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

23
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:28,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row, that's why.

24
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:29,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

25
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:29,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

26
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:31,307
[SPEAKER_08]: You stood this show up for Saints Row?

27
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:32,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you surprised?

28
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:33,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no.

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Not at all.

30
00:01:35,717 --> 00:01:37,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, welcome, Tech Master Loki.

31
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:39,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me introduce chat while you get situated real quick.

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,903
[SPEAKER_08]: We are, of course, the show where every gamer has a voice, and we always invite your voices via email.

33
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:46,264
[SPEAKER_08]: And, like, seriously, we need more voices via email.

34
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:46,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it true?

35
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:47,865
[SPEAKER_08]: No emails tonight?

36
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:51,508
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody's too busy playing Skyrim and Modern Warfare and all that stuff.

37
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:53,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

38
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,311
[SPEAKER_08]: The Twitter, of course, Twitter.com slash OLR.

39
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And our chat room, our live chat room, chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

40
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, I forgot to load chat.

41
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:03,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, guys.

42
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:24,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me give you this.

43
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,311
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to the mall yesterday and it was a madhouse.

44
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:28,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolute mad.

45
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:32,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I would have thought yesterday was like the weekend after Thanksgiving.

46
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:33,435
[SPEAKER_08]: It was that crowded.

47
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:42,041
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe that's a good sign that the economy is coming back or maybe people just want to get out and get their shopping done before all the craziness hits.

48
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:42,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

49
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:46,204
[SPEAKER_15]: This is why I don't go to the mall at all this time of year.

50
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:49,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't say I blame you, but that's where my haircut place is.

51
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:52,587
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to go over there and just there was other errands I wanted to do.

52
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:53,608
[SPEAKER_08]: So what can you do?

53
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,471
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

54
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's also introduce the chat room.

55
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:01,793
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get to the Skype calls a little later on.

56
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:02,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me talk about this.

57
00:03:02,953 --> 00:03:08,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of deals, I wanted to start off with a discussion on this real quick, and that is the Black Friday stuff that's starting to hit the Internet.

58
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:13,597
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you don't know what Black Friday is, I don't know what hole you've been living in, but maybe you don't live in the U.S.

59
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:14,217
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be it, too.

60
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:17,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving here in the U.S.

61
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:23,362
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's usually a day that's kind of the official, unofficial, official kickoff to the holiday shopping season.

62
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:26,423
[SPEAKER_08]: And things get discounted like crazy.

63
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:31,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the Black Friday ads are starting to leak out there on the Internet.

64
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,968
[SPEAKER_08]: And you kind of have to take a lot of what you read on the Internet with a grain of salt.

65
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:42,892
[SPEAKER_08]: But a website that's very respected and reputable within the gaming community, CheapAssGamer, at CheapAssGamer.com,

66
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:43,793
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

67
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:32,764
[SPEAKER_08]: The 4 gig console That's very inexpensive Considering that guy is usually about $199 That's a very deep discount Playstation 3 Seems to be $199 most places Probably the cheapest place is Walmart By a whole two cents But Best Buy and Radio Shack are deeply discounting that as well The Wii is down to $100 3DS going down to $179.99 That's a bundle Pack going on there I was going to say because that's not a discount at all Right but it's a bundle pack with a game

68
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:54,631
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see, discounts on games Current games, Batman Arkham City, gonna be $28 at Walmart, $29 at Best Buy Elder Scrolls, Skyrim, it's still $60 but you can get a $10 gift card at Target Gears of War 3 for $28 at Walmart Need for Speed, The Run, $30 at Best Buy

69
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Some pretty good deals throughout there.

70
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:01,976
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, that list I was reading from is just cheapassgamer.com.

71
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:04,118
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a little compilation going on there.

72
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,860
[SPEAKER_08]: That's their specialty is looking at game deals.

73
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:12,905
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to kind of ask the folks in the studio here, do you get excited about Black Friday?

74
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:15,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something you think you might participate in for some of these deals?

75
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:18,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are you like, hell no, get me the hell away from those stores?

76
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:18,949
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

77
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:19,610
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

78
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have anything I don't already want.

79
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:22,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

80
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:24,033
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want something, you just go get it.

81
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:28,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Having gone out to stores on Black Friday before, no, I'll be staying inside and playing Saints Row.

82
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,621
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, really, I can get just as good deals online.

83
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:36,665
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I know people who are going.

84
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:37,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

85
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:41,329
[SPEAKER_15]: So if they're going to be there anyway, I just say, okay, you do this for me.

86
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,911
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about Cyber Monday.

87
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:44,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Cyber Monday, I don't have to go anywhere.

88
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:46,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I just sit down and deals come to me.

89
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:46,874
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

90
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:48,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little more into the Cyber Monday.

91
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:53,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I have never gone out on Black Friday, but some of these deals, I don't know, they have me thinking.

92
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,119
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some good game prices.

93
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know who doesn't like Steam?

94
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:57,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to Steam.

95
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:58,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was going to say Cyber Monday.

96
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:00,524
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big Steam thing right there.

97
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:01,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

98
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:04,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Hat day is going to hurt on Steam, that's for sure.

99
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:06,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

100
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:13,213
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, really, the only things that I could possibly want slash need is I'd like a new laptop.

101
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:14,274
[SPEAKER_15]: That's about it.

102
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:17,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like for my current computer to not be a piece of shit.

103
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:21,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Which it won't be once I put Windows 7 and Linux Mint on it.

104
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:23,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that's coming soon.

105
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:28,458
[SPEAKER_08]: You told me the other day you were still running Vista and I was like, oh, poor thing.

106
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:30,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I've had problems going on.

107
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:35,319
[SPEAKER_15]: But I mean, right now, honestly, given my situation, I'm just lucky to have a roof over my head.

108
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to have food to eat.

109
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,661
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to have stuff to wear.

110
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:43,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So quite honestly... You're being very zen about the whole thing.

111
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,500
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just very like, you know, I don't need material possessions anymore.

112
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:50,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's not really so much of a that.

113
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:58,747
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that having been slapped in the face with the possibility of maybe being homeless or having nothing to eat.

114
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:00,308
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to be homeless.

115
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:07,150
[SPEAKER_15]: But it sort of realigned my values, I guess, my perspective.

116
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:07,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotcha.

117
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:16,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to really dread turning 30, but then when I was really sick in 2008, which you guys might remember, I was like, hey, turning 30 is awesome because I actually lived to be 30.

118
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Life is actually better once you're 30, too.

119
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,810
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is.

120
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,511
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, that's for another.

121
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:25,272
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for the Zen show, which will be our third podcast.

122
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:32,914
[SPEAKER_15]: But I mean, seriously, it's just sort of like, you know, if I want these games, I can rent them if I really want to play it.

123
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:37,536
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I've got tons of games that I've, you know, hardly played.

124
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:43,958
[SPEAKER_15]: I just started Project Diva, which is fun.

125
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:46,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll get into that in a minute during Gaming Weeks.

126
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,321
[SPEAKER_08]: But let me go to some of the comments from our chat room at chat.orangelantradio.com.

127
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:53,143
[SPEAKER_08]: HitStun says, I get roughly half my Christmas shopping done on Black Friday.

128
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:55,944
[SPEAKER_08]: SalaciousPop says, fuck the mall, seriously.

129
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:57,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Fry's.

130
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:59,406
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the only in-real-life store I'd go to.

131
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,867
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the worst.

132
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not go to Fry's on Black Friday.

133
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:11,812
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to go to Fry's and watch the guy walking around with a balloon that says, line ends here, and then you watch it snake through the entire store.

134
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:15,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did that one time because I think I was actually living with you at the time.

135
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:16,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think you were.

136
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:20,116
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was buying a replacement motherboard or something because my computer had died.

137
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:25,341
[SPEAKER_06]: and that line took like an hour and a half to go through not again

138
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:50,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, Actdeft says, I got my Dreamcast for $50 on a Black Friday sale.

139
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:51,123
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty awesome.

140
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:54,827
[SPEAKER_08]: GameGuru says, I got my 360 on a Black Friday a few years back.

141
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:58,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Eric K. says, I Black Friday on Amazon.

142
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,192
[SPEAKER_08]: And Amiga777 says, what's a fries?

143
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:02,834
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, they don't have them everywhere.

144
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:06,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Think like a Best Buy that's like three times as big.

145
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:07,843
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what a Fry's is.

146
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:11,286
[SPEAKER_08]: It sells, you know, a lot of electronic and appliances and all that.

147
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:12,547
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty much what a Fry's is, right?

148
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of good deals.

149
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,951
[SPEAKER_08]: They sell a lot more components than a Best Buy does.

150
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:18,492
[SPEAKER_15]: And really crappy toys that you don't need.

151
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:22,354
[SPEAKER_08]: and food, like nerd food.

152
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:23,814
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the other weird thing.

153
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:25,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Astronaut ice cream!

154
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:26,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Best Buy does kind of have that though.

155
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:29,216
[SPEAKER_08]: They have like the movie food at their counter, so whatever.

156
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:29,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

157
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:31,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's comments from our chat room.

158
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:46,041
[SPEAKER_06]: The fries, not only can you get your games and stuff like that, you can get stuff to outfit a convenience store, including a cotton candy maker, a hot dog cooker, and all sorts of things.

159
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:47,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just random stuff.

160
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:50,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that I've ever bought any of that shit at Fry's, but... I've thought about it.

161
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get your deep fryer at Fry's?

162
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:54,446
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was a Christmas gift.

163
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right, that's right.

164
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:58,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I want another one, but the wife won't let me.

165
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:04,453
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyhow, we're going to go on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

166
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:05,934
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start off with Dark Sakura.

167
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:07,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you mentioned Project D.Va.

168
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:13,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I had started it and then remembered that I had to write a research paper, so I turned it off.

169
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,160
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to actually find the...

170
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:22,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Charger for our PSP so that I can take it with me to school.

171
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:24,960
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's cute, very pretty.

172
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,602
[SPEAKER_15]: And I played some WoW.

173
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:30,904
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm almost level 60 on Gyaru.

174
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:33,907
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one in the Horde House Guild, right?

175
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:34,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the one in the Horde House Guild.

176
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:35,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

177
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:37,190
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really enjoying Priest.

178
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,651
[SPEAKER_15]: I never thought I would really like it.

179
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:39,262
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

180
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:54,570
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

181
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,204
[SPEAKER_15]: But you need to come back and we need to do Pally Pals.

182
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:17,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we were having fun with it for a while.

183
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob and I have paladins that look oddly related.

184
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,188
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a paladin named Diabetes.

185
00:11:23,188 --> 00:11:27,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Mine's named Sylviara, but I actually tried to make a decent name.

186
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:30,533
[SPEAKER_15]: I could have named her Cotton Candy.

187
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:36,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I decided since they weren't going to give me the walrus people so I could have a walrus named Diabetes, I guess I'll just have a paladin.

188
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:43,542
[SPEAKER_15]: I made you a Tuskar in the model viewer named Wilford.

189
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:46,003
[SPEAKER_15]: I made it in honor of you.

190
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:46,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

191
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:49,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm laughing at the salacious pop in our chat room.

192
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:52,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, Rob is going to come home with a churro machine now.

193
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:53,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they sell those at Fry's?

194
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if so, that's on my holiday list.

195
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:56,886
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't know.

196
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,166
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm serious.

197
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,106
[SPEAKER_06]: You go over there.

198
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,288
[SPEAKER_06]: It's part of the appliance section, at least in our local one over here in Roseville.

199
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a goddamn churro machine.

200
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:06,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how popular I'd be?

201
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be like having Disneyland in my house.

202
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:11,870
[SPEAKER_15]: I live in the cat bathroom, so I could always have.

203
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,350
[SPEAKER_06]: If they have a slurping machine there.

204
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:17,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I will have a slurping machine.

205
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:17,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, sorry.

206
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:18,788
[SPEAKER_15]: I know what I'm getting you, Rob.

207
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:19,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, DarkSakura.

208
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:22,169
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more of a gift for Salacious Pop.

209
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would you get me a gift for him?

210
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you'll benefit from it.

211
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:26,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

212
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:27,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

213
00:12:27,352 --> 00:12:29,873
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something where it's like it'll keep him busy so I can do what I want?

214
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:30,273
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

215
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:30,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

216
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:31,793
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

217
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:35,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, back to games you've been playing.

218
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:35,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow and so forth.

219
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:39,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I really haven't had a whole lot of time for games.

220
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:44,381
[SPEAKER_15]: As I said last week, we had to finish compiling the magazine this week.

221
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:45,962
[SPEAKER_15]: So most of my time has been spent at school.

222
00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:52,866
[SPEAKER_15]: So I did like a little bit of flash gaming and rearranged my entire portable hard drive.

223
00:12:54,788 --> 00:13:00,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I was hanging out with the art director while he was finishing the compiling and I had to do last minute corrections and stuff.

224
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:24,475
[SPEAKER_15]: that's all done hopefully we go to print I think tomorrow or Tuesday so now that that's done my research paper is ready I'm expecting everyone to buy an issue seriously you'll have my eternal gratitude if you buy an issue of the American River Review and can see all my gorgeous work that's okay I have enough issues already you've got subscriptions what are you talking about

225
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:27,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm running low on toilet paper.

226
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:29,124
[SPEAKER_15]: But Dan finished Arkham City.

227
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:30,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah?

228
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:31,587
[SPEAKER_15]: He finished all the missions.

229
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:32,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

230
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Has he found every Riddler trophy?

231
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:35,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I doubt it.

232
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:37,934
[SPEAKER_15]: He has found enough to find Riddler.

233
00:13:38,474 --> 00:13:38,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

234
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:42,358
[SPEAKER_15]: So he beat Riddler, which is kind of a letdown.

235
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

236
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,340
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's funny.

237
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,523
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to say Riddler sets off my gaydar.

238
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:52,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Riddler is kind of, like, this is going to sound really weird, but Riddler's kind of hot.

239
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it depends on which Riddler we're talking about.

240
00:13:55,072 --> 00:14:03,920
[SPEAKER_08]: But this Riddler is like... Not so much like Frank Gorshin, Riddler from 60s Batman, but I'm talking like when they tried to make Riddler very metrosexual.

241
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I was going to say metro, but he sets off, but he actually does set off my gaydar.

242
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:08,324
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

243
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:13,389
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the first time I've ever had a character in a game set off my infallible gaydar.

244
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:15,598
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the greatest question of all.

245
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:17,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

246
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:22,646
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Dan did the whole thing with Catwoman when you go back to help Batman.

247
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:24,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead, he did the thing where she leaves him.

248
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:29,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that part yet, so you better not be spoiling or I'll come over there and kick your butt.

249
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:29,897
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just funny.

250
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:32,119
[SPEAKER_15]: You should do it at least once because you can go back and fix it.

251
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear story mode is actually not that long, all things considered.

252
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:41,606
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the primary missions are really not that long, but there's so much else to do.

253
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:42,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Grand Theft Batman.

254
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:45,589
[SPEAKER_15]: The hush ones are really cool.

255
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:45,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm.

256
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:47,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

257
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:05,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know why I love Batman?

258
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:11,176
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not... I'm actually not a big comic reader, although, I don't know, like... I'm sitting here reading a comic right now.

259
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:20,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, funny enough, Salacious Pop bought... We went to a brand new comic book store out in Natomas, like some brand new place that just opened up like a month ago, and he bought The Killing Joke.

260
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:22,181
[SPEAKER_08]: The Killing Joke is very good.

261
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:24,622
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I was thinking I might steal that and read it.

262
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:27,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't usually... I'm not like a comic book reader.

263
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:29,985
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that I dislike them, I just... It's a fucked up story.

264
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:30,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, I know.

265
00:15:31,385 --> 00:15:41,910
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why I love Batman so much is not just the movies, which were brilliant, but seriously, growing up, I think I saw every single episode of the old Batman series from the 60s with Adam West.

266
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,132
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I did not grow up in the 60s, but they re-ran them all the time.

267
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:47,532
[SPEAKER_15]: But Julie Newmar was my hero.

268
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:48,553
[SPEAKER_08]: She's great.

269
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:51,554
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really sad that they don't re-run them now.

270
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:53,236
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

271
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:14,000
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a few characters in there that I know they're Batman characters, but I don't know who they are.

272
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,683
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew Solomon Grundy was a Batman character, but I had no idea who exactly he was.

273
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:21,205
[SPEAKER_15]: For me, I love the art in the game.

274
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:25,708
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've just been sitting there watching him because I'm looking at the scenery.

275
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:32,733
[SPEAKER_15]: And for me, my favorite place is when they go, I don't know if you've been there yet, but the Wonder City underground.

276
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:34,714
[SPEAKER_08]: The sunken streets.

277
00:16:34,814 --> 00:16:36,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been in a subway system underground.

278
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:37,116
Yeah.

279
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:44,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Under the subway, closer to where Wonder Tower is, you can go underground and it's like this World's Fair exhibition.

280
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:50,105
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's all these city streets, like little, you know, with buggies and everything, only it's all torn up.

281
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:52,627
[SPEAKER_15]: But a lot of the artwork in there is very Art Nouveau.

282
00:16:53,553 --> 00:17:00,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm up to the, just to give you an idea where I'm at in the story, keep in mind I have done some of the side quests, like some of the Zaz stuff, which that guy's scary.

283
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,962
[SPEAKER_15]: But, okay, was it just me or does his voice sound like a woman at first?

284
00:17:04,143 --> 00:17:06,565
[SPEAKER_08]: He just sounds like he has a problem.

285
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:07,986
[SPEAKER_08]: He sounded like a woman.

286
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,167
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to give him a hug, but you don't.

287
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:11,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll carve your name into my skin.

288
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:14,031
[SPEAKER_08]: He puts the notion in the basket.

289
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:17,855
[SPEAKER_06]: The chat room is reminding us that they do rerun him on the hub.

290
00:17:18,693 --> 00:17:19,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, The Hub.

291
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:20,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that really?

292
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:20,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

293
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:22,115
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

294
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:25,037
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, I was going to say, I am at the point in the game, I'm in the museum.

295
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:27,439
[SPEAKER_15]: As your hunting penguin.

296
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of.

297
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:34,584
[SPEAKER_08]: We just kicked some of his henchman's ass, and then we were at this part with boats, and you're having to use the grappling hook.

298
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:35,304
[SPEAKER_08]: That's annoying.

299
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:36,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

300
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:37,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so frustrated.

301
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how many times I've been eaten by a shark?

302
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:42,629
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know how many more times you're going to have to do shit like that in the game?

303
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:43,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Ugh.

304
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:46,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait till you get... Otherwise, I love it.

305
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait till you get the cryobomb.

306
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:49,053
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

307
00:17:49,913 --> 00:17:51,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you... Can't wait.

308
00:17:51,674 --> 00:17:52,934
[SPEAKER_14]: You throw it in the water.

309
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:55,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Or else it gets the hose again.

310
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:55,875
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, though?

311
00:17:55,895 --> 00:17:57,096
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to know what's really annoying?

312
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:58,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Is going and trying to do all that shit with Catwoman.

313
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:01,817
[SPEAKER_15]: But keep in mind, she can climb on the ceiling.

314
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:03,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, the Catwoman parts are my favorite so far.

315
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:04,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I love her whip!

316
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:06,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Her and Poison Ivy.

317
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:07,579
[SPEAKER_08]: She's so much fun to battle with.

318
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry.

319
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,140
[SPEAKER_15]: That's, that's, that's hotness.

320
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Or poison, I mean.

321
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:13,081
[SPEAKER_08]: She is, she is pretty hot.

322
00:18:13,282 --> 00:18:17,744
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I think in the chat room, Tigerclaw asked, hotter than Catwoman, I think in reference to my Riddler reference.

323
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:23,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I mean, it kind of depends on what you're into, but, you know, I'm very secure in my homosexuality when I say this.

324
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:24,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Catwoman has a nice rack.

325
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:27,930
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, it's the, uh, She's hot.

326
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,811
[SPEAKER_15]: the new style Catwoman, too.

327
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:31,512
[SPEAKER_15]: So she's probably fucking Batman.

328
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:36,675
[SPEAKER_08]: You just, like, any minute, that, that zipper's just gonna fly open and go, woohoo!

329
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:37,455
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

330
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:38,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

331
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:43,380
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, so while I haven't been playing it, I've really been getting into it.

332
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:50,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like I said, for me, it's going around and looking at everything and really taking in the scenery.

333
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:53,766
[SPEAKER_15]: And Dan will actually just stop and go exploring places for me so I can see it.

334
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:54,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's fun.

335
00:18:54,546 --> 00:18:55,166
[SPEAKER_15]: This is pretty cool.

336
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:59,869
[SPEAKER_08]: The other night I was playing with a group of friends and they were like, go in the place that says live nude girls.

337
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:01,489
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a place that says live nude girls.

338
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:01,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Go in the door.

339
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,410
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two signs.

340
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Live nude girls.

341
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:03,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

342
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:04,971
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you can go in there.

343
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:05,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the door was locked.

344
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:07,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming maybe it comes into play later.

345
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:10,754
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it really... Oh, really?

346
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:13,215
[SPEAKER_08]: I assumed it was a Riddler Room that came up later or something.

347
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:18,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of those... Of course, based on our speculation, Riddler Room wouldn't be at Live Noob Girls.

348
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:20,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah.

349
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:23,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, his little hideout, by the way, is fucking sadistic.

350
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,180
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it.

351
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,422
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but yeah... Dude, Tigerclaw says, you know you can punch the shark?

352
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:30,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

353
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:30,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

354
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:32,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna do that next time.

355
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:34,755
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna tell Dan to go punch the shark.

356
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:36,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna shoot him in the face with the electric gun.

357
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:38,358
[SPEAKER_15]: You bet you cannot jump it.

358
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:38,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow.

359
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,759
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to move on, sorry.

360
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,402
[SPEAKER_15]: So really, that's been what my gaming week has been.

361
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:52,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm planning on, now that I've got my research paper done, I've got like one more paper that I've got to do with my group, but we have to pick a piece of art.

362
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:54,729
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're doing the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

363
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:56,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

364
00:19:56,777 --> 00:20:01,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Because half the group's into modern movies and stuff.

365
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,682
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, we could do a movie.

366
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:03,943
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was like, we're going to do Rocky shit.

367
00:20:04,784 --> 00:20:06,405
[SPEAKER_15]: So they were coming over Tuesday to do the time warp.

368
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:07,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

369
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:11,830
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when that's all done, I'm going to play the shit out of Project Diva.

370
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:14,232
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

371
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:15,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Hell yeah.

372
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:17,135
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki.

373
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:19,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Need I ask, how was your gaming week?

374
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:21,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Very fulfilling.

375
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:24,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not playing a lot of things this week, actually.

376
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:27,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto Modern Warfare

377
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:46,968
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it doesn't have multiplayer in it.

378
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:48,529
[SPEAKER_06]: No deathmatch in it.

379
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

380
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:50,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

381
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:51,809
[SPEAKER_08]: It has co-op, but not deathmatch?

382
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:52,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

383
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:52,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

384
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,330
[SPEAKER_08]: So wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

385
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,351
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you're all about Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

386
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:57,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Like three?

387
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:58,711
[SPEAKER_08]: The new one?

388
00:20:59,111 --> 00:20:59,251
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

389
00:20:59,891 --> 00:20:59,991
[SPEAKER_06]: One.

390
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.

391
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:03,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

392
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:05,672
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that one.

393
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:06,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's cheap.

394
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:08,073
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to buy five copies.

395
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:37,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I see, so you're starting with the one you could get for $9.99 these days Exactly, so that's what we're playing And the only reason that they're switching to it is because they got tired of me beating them And I'm happy to report that our first game that we played on it I nearly, well I doubled second place's scores So I'm still going to beat them in this game So I don't know what the point was in switching, but whatever They wanted to mix it up I have an important news flash What?

396
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:38,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan brought me pizza

397
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:40,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he bring me pizza?

398
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:41,029
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get some.

399
00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:41,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

400
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:42,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll wait.

401
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,111
[SPEAKER_06]: And then other than that, let's see.

402
00:21:45,211 --> 00:21:51,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Zelda the Four Swords Adventure on the 3DS or DS, I guess.

403
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:53,715
[SPEAKER_06]: It's off the store.

404
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:55,696
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all right.

405
00:21:56,176 --> 00:22:01,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I think definitely more of a game for more than one person and not too fun playing it by yourself.

406
00:22:01,818 --> 00:22:04,059
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know.

407
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:04,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all right.

408
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,261
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, definitely more fun with more people.

409
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, yeah, yeah, yeah, I played Saints Row the Third, which is just amazing.

410
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:17,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually about 13 hours into it already, and it's just great.

411
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:23,698
[SPEAKER_06]: It's every bit of awesome that I wanted it to be it is, and then some.

412
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:26,581
[SPEAKER_08]: There's got to be something negative, something you're not happy about.

413
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:33,393
[SPEAKER_06]: The escort missions are still annoying because the AI is still kind of eh.

414
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:46,839
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit glitchy now and then, but not anything that really hurts the game, just like funny stuff like I'll finish a tank mission or something and when I'm done there's corpses stuck in the ground and so you can walk up to them and they kind of like bounce around back and forth and stuff.

415
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,562
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same shit that's funny in Skyrim, like mammoths just randomly falling from the sky and all that.

416
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:51,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

417
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Just random stuff, and that's fine.

418
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I expect that game to be slightly buggy, because that's how Saints Row is.

419
00:22:58,663 --> 00:23:00,944
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just slightly buggy, and it's fine.

420
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:02,604
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it more funny.

421
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:06,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say, though, the missions are great.

422
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:08,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Just what I've played so far.

423
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:12,886
[SPEAKER_06]: They have some really good direction to them, and...

424
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:22,129
[SPEAKER_06]: There's even some that have, like, kind of music that plays along with it that's just really awesome.

425
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:23,930
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sets the mood so well.

426
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,511
[SPEAKER_08]: How does the game... Like, you know, keep in mind, I haven't played a lot of the Saints Row games.

427
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:30,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I played the first one for, like, an hour, tops.

428
00:23:30,772 --> 00:23:34,894
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, how does it transition from all these bits of randomness one to another?

429
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:36,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Because isn't it a very open-world game?

430
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:42,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And, like, when I started seeing all this stuff, like, that there's Tron parodies in it and all these things, I was like, how do they...

431
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:45,039
[SPEAKER_08]: How do they work that all into the game?

432
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,161
[SPEAKER_08]: How does it go from one parody to another?

433
00:23:48,382 --> 00:23:49,523
[SPEAKER_06]: It works really well, actually.

434
00:23:49,864 --> 00:24:03,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And like the very beginning, the first few missions, actually quite a bit of the missions, I think I was up through 20% of the game and it was still doing tutorial missions, I guess, to kind of introduce you to the different activities that you can do in the game.

435
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:08,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's really strange sometimes.

436
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:20,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, there's one that you're being trained by this one saint that you pick up who's voiced by Hulk Hogan.

437
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:31,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's training you to be able to confront Kilbane, who's this luchador, the leader of the luchador gang or whatever in there and stuff.

438
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:31,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And so...

439
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:34,746
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like a little bit of Karate Kid, sort of.

440
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:41,969
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's great because one of the songs in the game is The Best from Karate Kid.

441
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,131
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the best around.

442
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:46,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, exactly.

443
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:51,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And they actually have that in the part when you first talk to the guy and stuff.

444
00:24:52,514 --> 00:24:54,115
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's having you feel pain.

445
00:24:54,155 --> 00:24:57,737
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the missions that you do, it's basically an activity.

446
00:24:57,857 --> 00:25:00,898
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's lots of pop culture references left and right, essentially.

447
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:00,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

448
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:04,382
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not all pop culture references.

449
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:06,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just really over the top.

450
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:09,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Just very big action sequences.

451
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,549
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people have you slapped in the face with a dildo?

452
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:12,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

453
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:15,453
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it keeps the stats for that.

454
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:17,455
[SPEAKER_06]: You lost count.

455
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:19,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

456
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:21,178
[SPEAKER_06]: This game has... How many whores have you killed?

457
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:22,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

458
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I've killed that many whores.

459
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:26,503
[SPEAKER_06]: There aren't that many... There's some strange shit, okay?

460
00:25:26,623 --> 00:25:33,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, seriously, you'll be walking around, all of a sudden, you know, there's gimps walking around, and then these furries walking around.

461
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:34,850
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what the hell is going on?

462
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Today...

463
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:37,832
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is an easter egg.

464
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:43,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Today, I ran across, you know, Genki, the cat head guy that's running this Japanese game show or whatever.

465
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,301
[SPEAKER_06]: The mascot for this game, almost.

466
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:51,526
[SPEAKER_06]: All of a sudden, I see him running around the street shooting people with rocket launchers.

467
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:51,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like,

468
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:53,891
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing out here?

469
00:25:54,472 --> 00:26:00,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I went to go try to kill him, and I did manage to kill him finally, but it took a lot.

470
00:26:00,677 --> 00:26:06,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it glitched him underneath a dump truck or something, and that crushed him to death.

471
00:26:07,142 --> 00:26:11,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Kaijudo in our chatroom is asking, Loki, did they fix the camera and the driving in Saints 3?

472
00:26:11,385 --> 00:26:14,988
[SPEAKER_08]: The bad camera and the bad driving killed Saints 2 for me.

473
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, that's chat.orange.com.

474
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:17,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they fixed the driving.

475
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,771
[SPEAKER_06]: The driving is awesome.

476
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:22,113
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

477
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:46,585
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just a horde mode.

478
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:48,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Some waves have whores in them.

479
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:51,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them, you're shrunken down really small.

480
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:52,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them, you're really big.

481
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:54,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Just ridiculous stuff.

482
00:26:56,028 --> 00:26:58,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think of some really strange stuff.

483
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:03,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I have a gun now that I can fire at a car that allows me to control it like an RC car, which is kind of fun.

484
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:06,031
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like Driver.

485
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:10,693
[SPEAKER_06]: You have parachutes that you can use whenever, so you can just skydive off a building and...

486
00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:14,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have wingsuits.

487
00:27:15,295 --> 00:27:16,995
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have any wingsuits, unfortunately.

488
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:17,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you having a lot of fun?

489
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:20,317
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds to me like you're just able to sandbox.

490
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:21,777
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

491
00:27:21,897 --> 00:27:23,958
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seriously a fun game.

492
00:27:23,978 --> 00:27:31,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be playing it probably during the show.

493
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:32,061
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.

494
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else to say on Saints Row for now?

495
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:37,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely pick it up.

496
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:38,206
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great game.

497
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:39,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's worth it.

498
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:44,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen some of the reviewers bitching about how the missions were very linear.

499
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it's a mission.

500
00:27:47,213 --> 00:27:48,094
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be linear.

501
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:51,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand what they're looking for.

502
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:53,138
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just so many games out right now.

503
00:27:53,158 --> 00:27:54,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't pick up Saints Row right now.

504
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:55,660
[SPEAKER_08]: There's too much.

505
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Too much!

506
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:57,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

507
00:27:58,382 --> 00:28:00,943
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

508
00:28:23,027 --> 00:28:26,948
[SPEAKER_08]: One other game I've been playing a lot of this week, I'm sure will come as no surprise to anyone, Skyrim.

509
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:30,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I picked up on Friday, had it delivered on release day.

510
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:33,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing Skyrim quite a bit since Friday.

511
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:41,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's very similar to Oblivion where you can, once you do the very first quest in the beginning, you can pretty much go out in the world and do whatever you want.

512
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:45,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that openness really turns some people off.

513
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:47,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was really giving this some thought earlier today.

514
00:28:47,915 --> 00:28:56,199
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really funny because we consider Oblivion a role-playing game, and we consider the Final Fantasy series a role-playing game, when in reality, the two could not be any more different.

515
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:58,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Those games are so, so different.

516
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,381
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously, put them side by side.

517
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:04,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XIII, criticized by many for being too linear.

518
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:05,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I disagree.

519
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:08,725
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was kind of a big part of Final Fantasy XIII.

520
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:10,365
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very, very story-driven.

521
00:29:11,106 --> 00:29:11,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

522
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:14,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Skyrim, not linear whatsoever.

523
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:19,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yes, there's a main quest, but there's about an eleventy billion other things you can do outside that main quest.

524
00:29:19,694 --> 00:29:23,518
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, now there's this whole, it randomly generates quests.

525
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:24,379
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like Fable?

526
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:25,420
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.

527
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,581
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's better than Fable.

528
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:26,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

529
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:30,785
[SPEAKER_15]: I meant like though in terms of its exploration.

530
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:31,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

531
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:37,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, yeah, because like some of the more recent Fable games, you kind of go around and do whatever, but it's just even on a bigger scale.

532
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:44,395
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just I love the fact that in Skyrim, you know, and they've been saying this a lot, you look at the top of a mountain, you can climb that mountain.

533
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:48,217
[SPEAKER_08]: And anywhere you look at from the top of that mountain, you can walk to.

534
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:49,918
[SPEAKER_08]: It might take you a while to get there, but you can do it.

535
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:53,081
[SPEAKER_08]: There might be some mammoths and giants in your way not wanting you to get there, but you can do it.

536
00:29:54,061 --> 00:29:59,005
[SPEAKER_08]: And just so many randomly generated things that just kind of like make you look away.

537
00:29:59,025 --> 00:29:59,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

538
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:17,571
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think in that sense you know again to compare with Final Fantasy 13 there sometimes is a bit of a grind to it there's numbers you want to out level and you know there is a lot of fun I love Final Fantasy I'm not dogging that at all in fact I think Final Fantasy 13 was really underrated by a lot of the gaming media I think it's a great game

539
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:45,139
[SPEAKER_08]: but Skyrim is just so different but you can't approach Skyrim like you do a Final Fantasy game or you're setting yourself up for trouble and that can be really hard because there's a lot of people that's like I gotta do and I gotta see everything in the game and I gotta not screw this up because I wanna get the perfect ending and it's like you can't have that in a game that is randomly generating quests if you can't put that aside you're gonna be in trouble I saw some pretty funny videos for Skyrim

540
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:49,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, one of my favorite things about games is how they're slightly buggy.

541
00:30:50,163 --> 00:30:52,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And Oblivion was slightly buggy and it was great.

542
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:56,068
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know if you've seen the video where you put a pot on someone's head.

543
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:56,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.

544
00:30:57,009 --> 00:30:57,729
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hilarious.

545
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,371
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they suddenly can't see.

546
00:30:59,451 --> 00:30:59,971
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

547
00:31:02,213 --> 00:31:05,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is funny because in that video, I recognized it.

548
00:31:05,316 --> 00:31:07,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, I did that guy's quest.

549
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:13,925
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, spoiler, if you do his quest to get the Dragon Claw, you will actually complete a story quest ahead of time.

550
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Just throwing it out there.

551
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:16,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Pro tip from me.

552
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,412
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, it's a great game.

553
00:31:20,572 --> 00:31:21,633
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gorgeous to look at.

554
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:24,514
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun.

555
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:26,155
[SPEAKER_08]: You just log in.

556
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:27,435
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do whatever you want.

557
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:36,077
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much to do, so much to explore, that sense of gratification, so many ways to develop your character.

558
00:31:36,137 --> 00:31:37,338
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't pick a class anymore.

559
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:40,038
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not a wizard or a warrior or anything.

560
00:31:40,078 --> 00:31:42,999
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just if you happen to use swords a lot, you skill up in swords.

561
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,560
[SPEAKER_08]: If you happen to stealth around a lot, you level up in sneaking.

562
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,900
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

563
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,281
[SPEAKER_08]: It builds the character as you play it, which is great.

564
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:53,021
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the constellation talent tree system is great, too.

565
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:55,022
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can effectively make a battle mage.

566
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:57,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's actually what I'm playing right now, pretty much.

567
00:31:58,443 --> 00:31:59,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's pretty fun.

568
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:13,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the very minor drawbacks I can think of, and there are still some surprising bugs in the game, despite how polished it's supposed to be after five years of development, some very obvious bugs.

569
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:20,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me tell you, I'm going to say the most nitpicky, crazy thing about a game, like ever.

570
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:22,847
[SPEAKER_08]: But this seriously is something that I find a little odd.

571
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:26,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And believe it or not, this is something that's going to appeal to DarkSakura.

572
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:29,069
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the design.

573
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:31,089
[SPEAKER_08]: The menu design.

574
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is going to be really nerdy, like the nerdiest thing you're ever going to hear in a game review.

575
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:43,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I find the usage of a narrow sans-serif font to be very strange and conflicting to the ambience of what these games are supposed to be about.

576
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I am dead fucking serious.

577
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,352
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, for that type of game, I really would agree with you.

578
00:33:15,032 --> 00:33:25,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Except that the thinner, the light styles of Sans Serif's always make me think of a little bit of an ethereal quality.

579
00:33:26,998 --> 00:33:32,901
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would have think that it should have been something a little bit more on the script side.

580
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:36,743
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also that it's the same font everywhere too, which is a little weird.

581
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:37,704
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

582
00:33:57,164 --> 00:34:03,728
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, well, I don't know what the font is in Skyrim, but it's like an Ariel Nero, and it's like, you know, there's only so much of that I can take.

583
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:04,769
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what Ariel is?

584
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:05,269
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

585
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:06,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Poor man's Helvetica.

586
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,391
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyway.

587
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:11,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, for serious, because Microsoft made that because they didn't want to pay for Helvetica.

588
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:11,693
[SPEAKER_15]: The end.

589
00:34:12,494 --> 00:34:12,954
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the truth.

590
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:16,937
[SPEAKER_15]: At least it's not, like, set in fucking Comic Sans or something.

591
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:18,238
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, that's true.

592
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:21,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Or Papyrus is another gag me font.

593
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know.

594
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:22,681
[SPEAKER_15]: But...

595
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:34,283
[SPEAKER_15]: It seemed, the look of it made me think that it was a placeholder text and that they just didn't change it.

596
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:39,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, this is the most extreme nitpicky thing I have ever talked about in a video game.

597
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:45,532
[SPEAKER_08]: The game is fantastic and do not let my bitching about the font deter your opinion.

598
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:50,436
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really care for the high renders of everything in the menu.

599
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:51,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

600
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:55,720
[SPEAKER_15]: If someone's running it on a PC, that's going to slow down their time.

601
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear it runs pretty decent on most PCs.

602
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:03,506
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing I did think was weird was that I didn't like how there was two different menus.

603
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:11,592
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one menu to bring up your quest log and stuff, but then there's another button you have to hit if you want your map or spells or the constellation.

604
00:35:12,273 --> 00:35:14,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of wish that had all been integrated into one menu.

605
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was kind of just odd.

606
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:17,857
[SPEAKER_08]: It felt really weird to play.

607
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:20,078
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm not sure why it was designed that way.

608
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:25,079
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't like having two menus because I keep thinking that the map is in the start key and it's not.

609
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,900
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the O or the circle.

610
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,540
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just weird.

611
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:34,302
[SPEAKER_15]: To answer, I wonder who protested the Ikea font change.

612
00:35:35,543 --> 00:35:35,923
[SPEAKER_15]: I did.

613
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:39,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Ikea always needs to use Futura forever.

614
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:42,425
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Typography Lounge Radio.

615
00:35:42,805 --> 00:35:43,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

616
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:48,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, the game is fantastic, but it is a different type of roleplaying game.

617
00:35:48,651 --> 00:35:49,712
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not for everybody.

618
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:51,434
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you just...

619
00:35:53,729 --> 00:36:16,183
[SPEAKER_08]: in some ways it's like an MMO where you don't have to deal with other people at all it has that open world sense to it and there's so much that you can interact with and do and the whole like quest forever type of thing almost feels like an MMO but without everything that people hate about MMOs which is other people usually so and a monthly fee so but Skyrim's great

620
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:23,452
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya asks if it's time for the classic font of the week.

621
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,657
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm much more prone to use the word typeface.

622
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,561
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it sounds a little bit classier.

623
00:36:30,618 --> 00:36:33,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Our comments from chat.orangeloungeradio.com, of course.

624
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:39,365
[SPEAKER_15]: The typeface of the week is Adobe Kazalan Pro.

625
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:39,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop.

626
00:36:41,086 --> 00:36:41,827
[SPEAKER_08]: No one care.

627
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:44,609
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

628
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,973
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get into some gaming news tonight, of course, with you guys live in our chat room and the calls later on.

629
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:51,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Classic Game of the Week and all that stuff.

630
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:52,776
[SPEAKER_08]: First, some other quick plugs.

631
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:55,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, if you're not already following us on Facebook, you should be.

632
00:36:55,117 --> 00:36:56,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash OrangeloungeRadio.

633
00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:19,267
[SPEAKER_08]: and we are on Twitter as well twitter.com slash OLR we are also now on Google Plus we have a brand new Google Plus page I know it's a reason to go back and look at Google Plus but here's what I really like about Google Plus is that because thanks to the whole circle thing we could actually post things on Google Plus that only our listeners could see so if we ever wanted to do like a secret club

634
00:37:19,747 --> 00:37:48,534
[SPEAKER_08]: we could post it on Google Plus because it wouldn't be public so follow us on Google Plus put us in your circles over there and if any juicy gossip comes up you know in the next couple months we will post it so that only the followers in our circles can see kind of like online only secret club otherwise information about the show and pictures and all that stuff it's hard for me to give a URL to Google Plus because you can't have names yet but just search for us just type Orange Launch Radio we'll come right up it's very easy to find I'm sure somebody will link in a chat here in a minute

635
00:37:50,078 --> 00:37:53,899
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really it for housekeeping, so let's get into some news.

636
00:38:17,123 --> 00:38:46,171
[SPEAKER_06]: that's what happens when the game is free I'm kind of curious though I wonder how many of those are actually paying for parts of the game or just you know kind of like you know how I would probably be would just I might want to try that out well from what I understand you can get upgrades to the game for only five bucks like there's two different levels there's one where you can pay like a monthly fee and get all the good stuff and then there's one where you just pay five bucks and you get a lot of little upgrades that's kind of neat I guess it's not bad

637
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:46,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Multiplayer

638
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:17,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Deathmatch.

639
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:18,225
[SPEAKER_06]: People like the Deathmatch stuff.

640
00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:22,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, speaking of multiplayer, I would actually like to check out the Halo Anniversary Edition at some point.

641
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:24,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I do like original OG Halo.

642
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to check that out at some point.

643
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to play Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7.

644
00:39:29,972 --> 00:39:31,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you heard about the Halo thing.

645
00:39:31,392 --> 00:39:33,433
[SPEAKER_06]: You know all those Kinect features they were talking about?

646
00:39:33,493 --> 00:39:33,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

647
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:34,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not at launch.

648
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,551
[SPEAKER_06]: They apparently are having trouble making them work.

649
00:39:39,872 --> 00:39:40,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, really?

650
00:39:40,592 --> 00:39:49,517
[SPEAKER_06]: You were having trouble making a voice command that changed the resolution from original to the new graphics or whatever?

651
00:39:49,897 --> 00:39:51,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And also a voice command to throw a grenade?

652
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,739
[SPEAKER_06]: You couldn't make that work at all?

653
00:39:56,241 --> 00:39:56,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Grenade.

654
00:39:57,682 --> 00:39:58,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Grenade.

655
00:39:58,202 --> 00:39:58,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it.

656
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:01,524
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't understand certain accents.

657
00:40:04,062 --> 00:40:05,903
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like you're saying grenade.

658
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:06,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Grenade.

659
00:40:06,984 --> 00:40:07,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you say lemonade?

660
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a fresh glass of lemonade.

661
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:12,246
[SPEAKER_06]: No, grenade.

662
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:16,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

663
00:40:16,768 --> 00:40:19,590
[SPEAKER_06]: So, well, I guess that's good.

664
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe some other MMOs Final Fantasy XIV should follow suit with that.

665
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to have to.

666
00:40:27,471 --> 00:40:28,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm already over Final Fantasy XIV.

667
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:30,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't touched it in like two weeks.

668
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Final Fantasy XIV isn't officially in launch until about a year from now.

669
00:40:34,454 --> 00:40:35,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see the whole 2.0.

670
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:38,655
[SPEAKER_08]: At least DC Universe didn't have to launch a 2.0.

671
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:45,138
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just getting the game that everybody wanted to play, but no one wanted to pay $60 in a monthly fee to play.

672
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:51,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, no shit they got a million people because tons of people wanted to play this game, but they were like, I'm not going to pay that kind of money for it.

673
00:40:53,427 --> 00:40:53,827
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

674
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,144
[SPEAKER_08]: The Simpsons Arcade Game has been classified in Australia.

675
00:41:15,565 --> 00:41:22,271
[SPEAKER_08]: What that means is that the rating has actually shown up on the Australian Classification Board's website.

676
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:29,759
[SPEAKER_08]: So it seems to indicate that the Simpsons Arcade Game could be on its way to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network because...

677
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:59,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Backbone is the one that is I guess registered the game Backbone Entertainment they do a lot of the like classic games stuff one of the more recent ones they did was the X-Men Arcade port and it is saying it's published by Konami so I don't know how that all works because I thought EA had the license but maybe some agreement was reached after all when the Ninja Turtles arcade game came out they did have a mutual agreement there so maybe something's been worked out so we may be getting the Simpsons arcade game on Xbox Live Arcade very soon which

678
00:41:59,824 --> 00:42:01,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yes to that.

679
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:03,146
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one of my favorite arcade games back in the day.

680
00:42:03,326 --> 00:42:08,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say we did a list list some time ago about Xbox Live Arcade game they most need and that was on it.

681
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,449
[SPEAKER_08]: So, heck yeah, that would be awesome.

682
00:42:11,749 --> 00:42:12,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they didn't screw it up.

683
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,351
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's like the X-Men Arcade port, I think it'll be fine.

684
00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:18,912
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the other stuff they've done has been alright.

685
00:42:20,713 --> 00:42:21,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, DarkSakura.

686
00:42:23,514 --> 00:42:26,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I was checking the mailbox again to make sure we actually had something this time.

687
00:42:27,376 --> 00:42:27,576
[SPEAKER_15]: We do.

688
00:42:28,036 --> 00:42:29,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Hooray.

689
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:34,584
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been going around, people have been talking about it, about the security breach with Valve.

690
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:40,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Valve actually did acknowledge that users' personal information had been compromised.

691
00:42:40,629 --> 00:42:42,631
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a security breach.

692
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:56,302
[SPEAKER_15]: They said that they accessed a Steam database in addition to the forums that usernames, passwords, game purchases, email address, billing addresses, credit card information...

693
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:26,410
[SPEAKER_15]: um they don't have evidence that credit card information or personal identification was taken um or that the protection on them was cracked they're still trying to get into that but um they said watch your stuff very closely which is why the only thing that's remotely linked on my Steam account is that I use PayPal that's it well lucky you but yeah my credit card of course was on Steam go figure

694
00:43:27,216 --> 00:43:32,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I don't think the new one is, because mine elapsed during the year, and I'm not sure I ever put the new one on.

695
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:35,726
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really buy a lot of stuff on Steam, and when I do, I just get it through PayPal.

696
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:36,947
[SPEAKER_08]: I buy tons on Steam.

697
00:43:37,468 --> 00:43:41,553
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, I don't know.

698
00:43:41,793 --> 00:43:45,798
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd think I'd be more pissed off about this because of what happened with Sony, but I don't know.

699
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:46,759
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a certain...

700
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:53,489
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a certain trust you kind of have with Valve because they get so much other stuff.

701
00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:58,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of feel like they're being a little more upfront with this than maybe necessarily Sony was.

702
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:02,575
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do feel like a lot of the data was probably encrypted pretty well.

703
00:44:03,175 --> 00:44:03,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

704
00:44:04,156 --> 00:44:23,583
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know well here's a statement from Newell we do not know of any compromised Steam accounts so we are not planning to force a change of Steam account passwords which are separate from the forum passwords however it wouldn't be a bad idea to change that as well especially if it's the same as your Steam forum account password so

705
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:47,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I think also at the end of the day, the fault of this is not Valve's fault, it's the hacker's fault I don't know what Valve did to necessarily provoke this besides maybe Gabe Newell getting up there at GDC and saying that it was unhackable and kind of daring people to do it at some point I don't think that he would do that

706
00:44:47,991 --> 00:44:50,653
[SPEAKER_08]: And it wasn't quite the way I'm saying it either.

707
00:44:50,713 --> 00:44:54,476
[SPEAKER_08]: He was just kind of showing about the security protection and all that, the Steam Guard and all that.

708
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:57,818
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the end of the day, these guys weren't in there to steal games.

709
00:44:58,939 --> 00:45:01,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe they didn't steal the credit card information.

710
00:45:02,321 --> 00:45:05,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Valve is just being very upfront that, hey, that information was at risk.

711
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:08,085
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know.

712
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:13,028
[SPEAKER_08]: The PlayStation Network kind of felt like a Benny Hill show from the beginning.

713
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,431
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one person tripping over another from there.

714
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:45,699
[SPEAKER_08]: but I mean obviously I'm not like I'm a little bit upset and I'd like to kind of see what Valve is going to do to make sure that my information doesn't stay at risk you know I want to hear more constant updates about what they do find out about what was taken and not and if they do suspect that credit card information was taken then they need to offer a lot of the same services like the debix and all that that PlayStation was offering but I don't know I kind of trust them to do a better job with their PR than I do Sony

715
00:45:47,702 --> 00:46:09,839
[SPEAKER_08]: at the end of the day no one ever had money taken from them on Sony either so and hopefully nobody has money taken from them on Valve either chat.orangeloundtrader.com some of the comments Salacious Pop says the credit card info they got as hashed encrypted to shit so they'd have to crack that to do anything also Steam only lets you store one card on and it's very easy to delete it

716
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:29,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft says Steam only saves the last cards you used GameGuru says Valve is how you are supposed to address being hacked DarkTetsuya says I did change my password even though I didn't really have any credit card info on it just out of habit for this sort of thing and that's a really good habit to have and if you haven't changed your Steam password you probably just should

717
00:46:30,629 --> 00:46:32,370
[SPEAKER_08]: What's to lose from doing it?

718
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:38,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's ever given me a good reason why you shouldn't change your password besides I can't keep track of all those different passwords.

719
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:42,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you're going to have to come up with a better excuse than that in this day and age.

720
00:46:42,352 --> 00:46:42,852
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

721
00:46:44,712 --> 00:46:46,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Kaijudo has a very good point, though.

722
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:49,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because Valve is run by nerds doesn't mean they're hack-proof.

723
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing is.

724
00:46:50,794 --> 00:46:53,054
[SPEAKER_08]: And GameGuru also puts this pretty clear here.

725
00:46:53,434 --> 00:46:54,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Valve's been clear and upfront.

726
00:46:55,035 --> 00:46:56,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony tried to hide everything.

727
00:46:56,975 --> 00:46:57,696
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, too.

728
00:46:57,756 --> 00:47:04,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I do seem to remember that Sony, you know, the network was still up for a few days after, and then it was bad.

729
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:11,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeOnlineRadio.com is the place where those comments are coming from right now, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

730
00:47:11,864 --> 00:47:17,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Khasin in our chat room, K-H-A-S-N, says, I need to check my credit card transactions.

731
00:47:17,308 --> 00:47:19,909
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just a good thing to do anyway.

732
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, yeah, this should motivate you to do that, but just, I think...

733
00:47:24,412 --> 00:47:28,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Check them at least once a week, if not like three times a week.

734
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:30,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I check my bank account every day.

735
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:34,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Just A, I like to know how much money is in there because who actually balances a checkbook anymore?

736
00:47:35,437 --> 00:47:40,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And B, I just like to see that all the transactions that are going through are things that I actually initiated.

737
00:47:41,645 --> 00:47:46,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, before the show, I checked my PayPal, just to be sure.

738
00:47:46,988 --> 00:47:49,089
[SPEAKER_15]: And, of course, there's nothing, because I'm broke.

739
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:49,769
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good.

740
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:50,929
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you want to see.

741
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:51,470
[SPEAKER_15]: But, yeah.

742
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:56,952
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the last thing on there was last month when I bought the Humble Indie Bundle.

743
00:47:57,893 --> 00:47:58,233
[SPEAKER_15]: That was it.

744
00:47:58,613 --> 00:47:58,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

745
00:48:00,314 --> 00:48:00,574
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

746
00:48:01,925 --> 00:48:05,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well hopefully we'll get more information on that in the weeks to come as to who did it.

747
00:48:06,212 --> 00:48:07,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Hang them up by their balls.

748
00:48:07,675 --> 00:48:08,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Who done it?

749
00:48:08,557 --> 00:48:08,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Who done it?

750
00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:11,322
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Miss Scarlet in the conservatory.

751
00:48:12,845 --> 00:48:16,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, Steam isn't the only thing to get hacked this week.

752
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:26,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the My Resistance website, the official website for the game Resistance from Sony, got hacked as well, and their forums are down as well.

753
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:37,808
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically, there's no... It hasn't been immediately verified by Insomniac or Sony whether...

754
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:39,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything was done.

755
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:48,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anything's really compromised other than these people's usernames and passwords and maybe emails because you don't store credit card information on this website.

756
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:54,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, yeah, it sucks.

757
00:48:54,948 --> 00:48:55,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Hackers are going to hack.

758
00:48:57,088 --> 00:48:57,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's true.

759
00:48:57,788 --> 00:49:00,289
[SPEAKER_08]: We have said that before.

760
00:49:00,529 --> 00:49:02,409
[SPEAKER_08]: What do they get from this besides?

761
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:06,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's not like they have credit cards on the Resistance site or anything like that, right?

762
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:17,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what they could be doing is they could be harvesting usernames and passwords, maybe emails and stuff to try to run those against logins on the PlayStation Network.

763
00:49:18,352 --> 00:49:26,197
[SPEAKER_06]: to see if any of those people have the same username, password, login info that they would on both of those.

764
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:32,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if maybe there's a way to link your account to that site or something.

765
00:49:32,661 --> 00:49:34,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you'd have to put your password in there for that.

766
00:49:34,882 --> 00:49:46,629
[SPEAKER_06]: But my guess is it's mainly just to find username, password combos that they can try at a bunch of different websites and see if people are using the same things and maybe get access to accounts that way.

767
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:50,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well more hacking stories.

768
00:49:51,316 --> 00:49:56,921
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox hackings are still kind of slowly bubbling through the press and so forth.

769
00:49:57,421 --> 00:50:02,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I've addressed this on a show before, if you forgot, I had $150 stolen from my Xbox back in August.

770
00:50:02,946 --> 00:50:06,009
[SPEAKER_08]: It was about August 14th, 15th or so that that happened.

771
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:12,171
[SPEAKER_08]: and I basically lost access to my Xbox for a month while they were investigating and finally got my money back.

772
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:15,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was about 28 days after the incident had happened.

773
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:20,814
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was out 150 bucks for 28 days and that's not something I know everybody can afford to do.

774
00:50:21,494 --> 00:50:22,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So you gotta be very careful.

775
00:50:23,175 --> 00:50:28,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft refuses that anything is going on but I know at least 10 individuals that this has happened to.

776
00:50:29,197 --> 00:50:30,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not making that number up.

777
00:50:30,498 --> 00:50:34,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, I have a lot of Facebook friends and people on Twitter but I know at least 10 individuals

778
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:49,938
[SPEAKER_08]: and then I still have people telling me like friends of friends and so forth so I know that doesn't seem like a very large number but considering I know people all through the spectrum from people who play games all the time every day to people that hadn't touched their account in one to two years

779
00:50:50,879 --> 00:50:52,800
[SPEAKER_08]: That tells me that something's going on.

780
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,961
[SPEAKER_08]: And this shit made me angry this week as I saw that there was a report on Eurogamer.

781
00:50:57,001 --> 00:50:58,001
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not mad at Eurogamer.

782
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:58,901
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just reporting it.

783
00:50:58,981 --> 00:51:00,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't shoot the messenger, right?

784
00:51:00,562 --> 00:51:16,887
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently Microsoft is claiming that all these FIFA Ultimate Team Pack purchases that are the, quote, hacks going on, Microsoft is claiming in an interview with Eurogamer from Online Safety Director Doug Park, it is not a hack, that it is some type of, quote, new attack vector.

785
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote, it's not a hack.

786
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:21,729
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really just a different way to monetize stolen accounts.

787
00:51:23,069 --> 00:51:23,289
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

788
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Any service has compromises.

789
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:27,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook has compromises.

790
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:28,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow has compromises.

791
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:32,073
[SPEAKER_08]: What they're really doing is trying to make money off those compromises.

792
00:51:32,394 --> 00:51:34,214
[SPEAKER_08]: So FIFA is a very popular title.

793
00:51:34,475 --> 00:51:36,556
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a new way for the bad guys to make money.

794
00:51:36,876 --> 00:51:38,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't based on our investigation.

795
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:39,717
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't see anything new.

796
00:51:39,837 --> 00:51:41,098
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just a different avenue.

797
00:51:41,858 --> 00:51:45,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not getting into super detail, but there's basics of account compromise.

798
00:51:45,581 --> 00:51:48,583
[SPEAKER_08]: There's phishing, there's social engineering, there's malware.

799
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Based off the industry today, most of it comes off malware and phishing.

800
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,526
[SPEAKER_08]: If they get the accounts, they sell it.

801
00:51:53,887 --> 00:51:55,108
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really all they were doing.

802
00:51:55,168 --> 00:52:01,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether it's FIFA or an account with a PlayStation subscription or an account with a live subscription, it's all basically the same thing.

803
00:52:02,813 --> 00:52:09,618
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, he's deflecting, he's refusing to accept that anything's going wrong at Xbox, and you, sir, are lying.

804
00:52:10,933 --> 00:52:18,267
[SPEAKER_08]: you may not know you're lying but I'm here to tell you that these claims that this is all like phishing and all this stuff you're full of crap

805
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:19,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Wake up!

806
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:22,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Because something deeper is going on here.

807
00:52:22,242 --> 00:52:24,783
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has to do with Xbox, and it has to do with EA.

808
00:52:25,623 --> 00:52:27,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I will poke a hole in this right now.

809
00:52:28,244 --> 00:52:30,845
[SPEAKER_08]: The people that are getting hacked, it's not just FIFA.

810
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Dun-dun-dun!

811
00:52:33,045 --> 00:52:34,426
[SPEAKER_08]: It's other EA games.

812
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:38,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I know somebody that got money stolen out of Madden.

813
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:44,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I know somebody where the first game that they went into to go play on it was...

814
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:46,250
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

815
00:53:06,294 --> 00:53:15,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Can anyone show me a game or an Xbox hack that's going on that did not somehow involve an EA product?

816
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:17,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Can anyone show that?

817
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:28,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.orangenowlandsradio.com Twitter.com slash OLR Is anyone that's been impacted, where money has been taken out of the account, was an EA game not involved?

818
00:53:28,935 --> 00:53:31,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'll tell you what, I think I know the link.

819
00:53:33,448 --> 00:53:40,132
[SPEAKER_08]: The link is, I believe that the people that are getting hacked are people that do not play EA Sports games.

820
00:53:42,873 --> 00:53:50,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never played an EA Sports game on Xbox Live, save for Burnout Paradise, which does not have the EA Network.

821
00:53:51,277 --> 00:53:55,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the other, like Rock Band, which isn't a part of that new EA Network and all that.

822
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:02,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Other people that I know that have been hacked do not play EA Sports games online, or they have not played their Xbox in several years.

823
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:12,071
[SPEAKER_08]: if you do not have your Xbox account tied to the new EA system you are vulnerable

824
00:54:13,726 --> 00:54:35,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that I don't have any proof but trending that I see so I'm just some schmo on a podcast putting that out there whatever take it or leave it but I'm telling you I think if you want to best protect yourself one thing that you should do right now well in addition to change your password which I've told you 5,000 times to do and if you haven't done it by now I don't know what to tell you but I think what you should do

825
00:54:36,141 --> 00:54:43,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Go download the demo for either NBA Jam on Fire or Need for Speed The Run, which, granted, wasn't a bad demo.

826
00:54:44,444 --> 00:54:48,325
[SPEAKER_08]: When you play those demos, you're going to have to create an EA account to get onto those servers.

827
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:56,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you'll establish a link between your Xbox and your EA account because I'm telling you, when I got hacked, they linked a fake account up.

828
00:54:57,768 --> 00:55:22,929
[SPEAKER_08]: and somehow there's some vulnerability there that neither Microsoft nor EA will admit but I'm telling you there's too much of a trend here for me to ignore as a gamer as somebody who doesn't want the fans of this show to lose money I'm just telling you what I'm seeing in all these other cases are people that have not linked the EA account through some type of sports title are the ones that are being hacked I don't know how they're doing it but that's the common denominator damn it

829
00:55:23,248 --> 00:55:40,830
[SPEAKER_06]: at the very least going ahead and associating it with an account would prevent whatever exploit there might be from being used I don't think it's necessarily that they're not getting hacked it's just that they're not buying anything with it because once they find out oh well I can't get access to the EA thing then well not much I can do there

830
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:48,283
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know, I'm kind of irritated that this bozo would go out there and say that we're all being phished.

831
00:55:48,863 --> 00:55:49,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he's wrong.

832
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:53,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I know somebody that hadn't touched their Xbox in two years.

833
00:55:54,748 --> 00:55:57,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm supposed to believe that guy somehow got phished?

834
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:03,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I haven't played my Xbox in two years, but shit, I'm gonna log onto this website and just give them my Xbox login.

835
00:56:04,335 --> 00:56:04,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?! !

836
00:56:07,225 --> 00:56:36,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to think I'm somewhat smarter than that too I mean I like to think I mean I'm not gonna be all Sony big in the head about it that I am in penetratable when it comes to getting you know my information fished or whatever but I'd like to think I always think twice about links I click on and websites I'm visiting and make sure the websites are genuine so if this guy's gonna come out and say that I'm getting fished you better be ready to throw down because you might be wrong and if you're wrong I'm gonna be double mad

837
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:57,227
[SPEAKER_08]: 5thDream in our chatroom at chat.orangesoundstrater.com says you'd be amazed how many people don't know the password that their email address associated with their Xbox Live accounts get it reset, you gotta do something take control of that, especially if you have a credit card tied to it

838
00:56:57,927 --> 00:57:26,856
[SPEAKER_08]: they're getting in there somehow I don't know what they're doing I don't know how they're doing it if we knew it would be all over the gaming media but nobody can figure out how they're doing it and Microsoft won't admit that there's a problem because somehow they're both being used Microsoft and EA and I don't I can't figure out how somebody's gonna figure it out though honestly I think they should start looking into their password reset system

839
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:37,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say one more thing about this because this is the other thing that this guy is deflecting because he tries to throw all these other companies under the bus and he says any service has compromises.

840
00:57:38,263 --> 00:57:39,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow has compromises.

841
00:57:40,405 --> 00:57:41,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, true point.

842
00:57:41,446 --> 00:57:42,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also had my Wow account hacked.

843
00:57:43,188 --> 00:57:45,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I know how that happened and I do think that was phishing.

844
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:49,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I used, I logged into a computer that I shouldn't have logged into Wow in.

845
00:57:49,714 --> 00:57:50,734
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay, fair enough.

846
00:57:50,815 --> 00:57:52,796
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, again, I said earlier, I'm not perfect.

847
00:57:53,097 --> 00:57:54,278
[SPEAKER_08]: It can't happen, okay?

848
00:57:54,979 --> 00:57:58,750
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a big difference between what WoW is doing and what Microsoft's doing.

849
00:58:00,899 --> 00:58:04,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Blizzard will openly admit that your accounts are vulnerable to theft.

850
00:58:04,902 --> 00:58:07,264
[SPEAKER_08]: That people will try and steal your Xbox accounts.

851
00:58:07,664 --> 00:58:17,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Blizzard will sell an authenticator so that you can get into your accounts and try to bring incentives for you to use those authenticators like free pets and so forth.

852
00:58:17,612 --> 00:58:21,235
[SPEAKER_08]: They've come up with new ways of authentication like authenticating by phone.

853
00:58:21,475 --> 00:58:24,117
[SPEAKER_08]: They are constantly trying to change the security in their system.

854
00:58:24,378 --> 00:58:25,679
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you doing, Microsoft?

855
00:58:26,439 --> 00:58:28,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're watching the situation very closely.

856
00:58:30,146 --> 00:58:35,170
[SPEAKER_15]: On top of that, they give away the authenticator for free and the only thing that you have to pay for is if you buy a physical authenticator.

857
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:35,611
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

858
00:58:35,631 --> 00:58:37,152
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the mobile phone authenticator for free.

859
00:58:37,172 --> 00:58:37,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is what I use.

860
00:58:38,013 --> 00:58:38,653
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very true.

861
00:58:38,733 --> 00:58:39,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

862
00:58:40,395 --> 00:58:41,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft doesn't have anything like that.

863
00:58:42,216 --> 00:58:45,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft doesn't tell people to change their passwords regularly.

864
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft won't admit that there's people out there trying to steal money from your account.

865
00:58:50,163 --> 00:59:19,146
[SPEAKER_08]: and at least if they're doing it I'm sure they would come back and say well Rob it is right here on the website okay on some page people never look at and a font size not big enough anyone can see it it is right there on the login screen as you're waiting for the game to load on WoW protect your account from theft do A, B, and C that's the level of stuff that Microsoft needs to do because accounts are being stolen and it's not just you know because we're all stupid when it comes to learning the internet

866
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:22,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, I've ranted enough.

867
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:22,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

868
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,022
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just, it just irritates me.

869
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:30,147
[SPEAKER_08]: This is such corporate, you know, just talking out his butt.

870
00:59:30,948 --> 00:59:35,793
[SPEAKER_08]: And it irritates me the more Microsoft tries to deny that anything is wrong.

871
00:59:36,124 --> 00:59:39,925
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what another term for talking out of your butt is?

872
00:59:40,405 --> 00:59:40,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Farting.

873
00:59:41,986 --> 00:59:42,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Or shit.

874
00:59:42,806 --> 00:59:44,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I said I was dumb, but I'm not.

875
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:56,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Furthermore, maybe it would irritate me a lot less if that, you know, the other part of this is that I was locked out of my Xbox account for 28 days.

876
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,251
[SPEAKER_08]: How long was I out of my WoW account when I got hacked?

877
01:00:02,651 --> 01:00:02,951
[SPEAKER_08]: A day?

878
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:03,672
[SPEAKER_08]: An hour.

879
01:00:04,472 --> 01:00:04,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

880
01:00:07,113 --> 01:00:08,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Fix it, Microsoft!

881
01:00:09,935 --> 01:00:10,895
[SPEAKER_15]: And have better fonts.

882
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:13,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

883
01:00:30,948 --> 01:00:41,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's actually, um, there's also the beacons functionality added in so that, um, you can, um, say which games you would like to play with other people.

884
01:00:42,015 --> 01:00:43,295
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's actually on Xbox Live now.

885
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:51,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, new messaging, new browsing, um, new searching for films and TV, that type of thing.

886
01:00:52,201 --> 01:00:56,003
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, they have a new interface that goes with the Metro UI theme.

887
01:00:57,124 --> 01:00:57,344
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

888
01:00:59,246 --> 01:01:02,629
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess that's cool, but honestly it's not enough.

889
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:03,811
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's something.

890
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's better than what was there before, which was, you know, he's still having to call support and all that stuff.

891
01:01:11,444 --> 01:01:18,790
[SPEAKER_08]: But by the way, just just to throw it out there, certain other subscription things you cannot cancel online as easily still.

892
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:21,412
[SPEAKER_08]: So although it may make it sound like there's certain things.

893
01:01:21,692 --> 01:01:24,034
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, I tried to go in the first thing I tried to do.

894
01:01:24,695 --> 01:01:25,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only did Microsoft.

895
01:01:26,176 --> 01:01:26,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

896
01:01:26,837 --> 01:01:28,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm so mad at them lately.

897
01:01:28,578 --> 01:01:31,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only did Microsoft automatically update my credit card info.

898
01:01:32,561 --> 01:01:33,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what they did.

899
01:01:33,281 --> 01:01:35,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they guess the new expiration date?

900
01:01:35,462 --> 01:01:40,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how they did it, but they automatically updated my credit card information.

901
01:01:40,624 --> 01:01:41,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remove it.

902
01:01:42,605 --> 01:01:46,547
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't remove your credit card on the website.

903
01:01:46,587 --> 01:01:56,431
[SPEAKER_08]: You try to click remove and it goes, you cannot remove this card because you are currently using this card to pay for your one month card of Xbox Live.

904
01:01:57,594 --> 01:01:58,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

905
01:01:58,475 --> 01:02:04,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remove my credit card because I'm using it to fund a prepaid Xbox Live card?

906
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:09,223
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's when you report it to the Better Business Bureau.

907
01:02:12,325 --> 01:02:12,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridiculous.

908
01:02:13,686 --> 01:02:15,608
[SPEAKER_08]: But Rob, you're paying for the free card.

909
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:16,328
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

910
01:02:16,669 --> 01:02:18,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, but you're paying for the free card.

911
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:18,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

912
01:02:23,424 --> 01:02:24,004
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hilarious.

913
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:28,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, not in a funny way, but just... I was like, seriously?

914
01:02:28,587 --> 01:02:29,867
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are going to go that far?

915
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:37,711
[SPEAKER_08]: So much smoke and mirrors from Microsoft to the point where I am seriously considering the next console.

916
01:02:37,971 --> 01:02:40,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody called me out on Twitter, too, about it, which is fine.

917
01:02:40,513 --> 01:02:41,233
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

918
01:02:41,253 --> 01:02:41,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an opinion.

919
01:02:41,933 --> 01:02:45,055
[SPEAKER_08]: If you think there's a problem with it, then whatever.

920
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:52,139
[SPEAKER_08]: But somebody had said, wait, you were mad at Microsoft when PlayStation was the one that got hacked and all that?

921
01:02:53,119 --> 01:03:00,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair point, but still, has anyone presented a case where somebody actually had money stolen from them from PlayStation?

922
01:03:00,842 --> 01:03:02,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anyone been able to prove that?

923
01:03:03,683 --> 01:03:07,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I could prove to you about 10 different cases of money being stolen.

924
01:03:08,424 --> 01:03:11,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Many, many more if you look at the web forums that are out there on Xbox.

925
01:03:12,626 --> 01:03:13,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are we all mad at Sony again?

926
01:03:17,607 --> 01:03:19,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of the potential loss.

927
01:03:20,154 --> 01:03:21,435
[SPEAKER_06]: The potential, Rob.

928
01:03:22,697 --> 01:03:23,778
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna be mad at Sony.

929
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:30,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Be mad at Sony about, you know, them Bumble fucking tripping over their own feet in handling the situation.

930
01:03:30,685 --> 01:03:32,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying, Microsoft's really no better.

931
01:03:34,824 --> 01:03:35,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is their MO.

932
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at what they did with the Red Ring systems and stuff like that.

933
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:40,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was a small percentage.

934
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:41,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was like 1%.

935
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:47,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely not 100% or 50% or whatever.

936
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:48,096
[SPEAKER_08]: So just flip it.

937
01:03:48,136 --> 01:03:48,937
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I'm saying.

938
01:03:49,297 --> 01:03:50,919
[SPEAKER_08]: The folks that are saying that, flip it.

939
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you give Microsoft a pass all the time?

940
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be equally critical of all the game companies.

941
01:04:02,355 --> 01:04:02,836
[SPEAKER_06]: We should.

942
01:04:02,856 --> 01:04:04,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo, why aren't you embracing online?

943
01:04:04,177 --> 01:04:05,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we should when we give them hundreds of dollars.

944
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:07,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Which we do.

945
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:11,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a right to be critical of a company I'm giving hundreds of dollars to.

946
01:04:13,428 --> 01:04:15,290
[SPEAKER_08]: That holds my credit card hostage, but anyway.

947
01:04:16,511 --> 01:04:17,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

948
01:04:17,072 --> 01:04:18,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Release dates.

949
01:04:19,114 --> 01:04:23,139

[SPEAKER_08]: There is also a game coming out called Naorihan no Mago Hiyaki Rairo Ran Taisen that comes out this week from Konami.

1019
01:11:03,652 --> 01:11:06,795
[SPEAKER_08]: This looks like... I'm trying to figure out what game this is.

1020
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:08,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's based on an anime.

1021
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:12,599
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a fighting game that's coming out.

1022
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:21,267
[SPEAKER_08]: From the strongest team to defeat the Haragomo Kitsune, that powerful fox spirit has been devouring people and usurping power since the Heian era...

1023
01:11:21,767 --> 01:11:27,032
[SPEAKER_08]: and Riko, the leader of Hakai Yayo, the March of 100 Ogres, is the one to defeat her.

1024
01:11:27,573 --> 01:11:32,838
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a fighting game on the 360 that I am not familiar with on this side of the pond.

1025
01:11:33,919 --> 01:11:38,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to the PlayStation 3, Call of Duty in subtitles there as well.

1027
01:11:44,688 --> 01:11:48,250
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a... Oh, it's the Studio Ghibli game on PlayStation 3.

1028
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:51,971
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks like it could be very impressive, actually.

1029
01:11:52,111 --> 01:11:53,672
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks... Oh, it's all cartoony.

1030
01:11:54,612 --> 01:11:55,692
[SPEAKER_08]: That game's very cute.

1031
01:11:55,712 --> 01:11:56,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me look.

1032
01:11:56,293 --> 01:11:56,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait.

1033
01:11:56,593 --> 01:11:56,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Go back.

1034
01:11:56,953 --> 01:11:57,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.

1035
01:11:58,753 --> 01:12:00,754
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Studio Ghibli on PlayStation 3.

1036
01:12:00,794 --> 01:12:01,995
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cute.

1037
01:12:02,255 --> 01:12:02,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1038
01:12:03,735 --> 01:12:06,036
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks like it would be worth importing.

1039
01:12:06,237 --> 01:12:06,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1040
01:12:07,037 --> 01:12:09,618
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Ni no Kuni.

1041
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:11,999
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a magical land on the PlayStation 3.

1042
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:16,001
[SPEAKER_08]: The orphan Oliver is determined to save his mother who died to save him.

1043
01:12:16,361 --> 01:12:23,545
[SPEAKER_08]: In order to do so, he followed Shizuku, the fairy of the tears, into the world of Ni no Kuni to defeat the evil magician Jabo.

1044
01:12:23,565 --> 01:12:23,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh.

1045
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:26,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Ni no Kuni

1046
01:12:50,732 --> 01:13:00,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to the PSP, Angelique Amarin no Rokukishi comes out this week as well as Uminiko no Naku Koroni Portable 2 from Alchemist.

1047
01:13:03,786 --> 01:13:03,986
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

1048
01:13:28,442 --> 01:13:31,086
[SPEAKER_15]: In Europe, on the 15th, we have... Well, this is UK.

1049
01:13:31,506 --> 01:13:39,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Assassin's Creed Revelations, I, Pet and Friends, Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary, Medieval Moves, Deadman's Quest, and Roshard.

1050
01:13:40,397 --> 01:13:42,901
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have on the 18th...

1052

[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1053
01:14:00,985 --> 01:14:01,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Busy, busy.

1054
01:14:02,306 --> 01:14:07,469
[SPEAKER_08]: In our chat room, by the way, they are talking about Ni No Kuni, which I had mentioned before, the Studio Ghibli game.

1055
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:12,652
[SPEAKER_08]: They are saying, some folks, Alpha Cananogram says, they did say that it's coming to North America, I think.

1056
01:14:12,692 --> 01:14:14,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dark Tetsuya says, I thought it was coming out over here.

1057
01:14:14,753 --> 01:14:16,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it probably is, but not this week.

1058
01:14:16,955 --> 01:14:18,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Japan's getting it first.

1059
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:21,677
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're getting it, what, summer next year, maybe?

1060
01:14:21,817 --> 01:14:22,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Spring.

1061
01:14:22,518 --> 01:14:22,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Spring.

1062
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you looked it up, huh?

1063
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:26,140
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just know.

1064
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:27,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well.

1065
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:28,971
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are getting it.

1066
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,831
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just going to take a little time for the translation.

1067
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:31,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1068
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:35,152
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1069
01:14:35,712 --> 01:14:47,416
[SPEAKER_06]: But first... Well, everyone's been wondering with the Vita, is there going to be a way for me to import my games that I may have on UMD to the Vita?

1070
01:14:47,856 --> 01:14:48,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And the answer is yes.

1071
01:14:48,876 --> 01:14:50,196
[SPEAKER_06]: There is actually a way to do that.

1072
01:14:50,596 --> 01:14:52,977
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not free, but...

1073
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,659
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1074
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:29,833
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course they haven't announced prices over here yet since the Vita is still a ways away but in Japan it ranges between an average of 500 and 1000 yen so it's not bad I mean that's a pretty good compromise I think

1075
01:15:31,134 --> 01:15:39,723
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, really, if you want to abuse that, you could take a friend's, you know, UMD or rent a UMD or something like that, pop it in there, register it like you own it.

1076
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:45,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's no way for them to know, but at least you get a little bit of a discount if you're planning on actually buying the game anyways.

1077
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:52,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I still don't like the fact that I'm having to basically put in the UMD to have the privilege of paying for the game all over again.

1078
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:54,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, I get it.

1079
01:15:54,737 --> 01:15:55,318
[SPEAKER_08]: It just sucks.

1080
01:15:55,868 --> 01:15:58,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the only reason they're doing that is because they know people are going to abuse it.

1081
01:15:59,631 --> 01:16:00,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they can.

1082
01:16:01,152 --> 01:16:08,498
[SPEAKER_06]: And because, really, just play it on your PSP then if you don't want to pay for it.

1083
01:16:10,459 --> 01:16:11,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's true.

1084
01:16:12,641 --> 01:16:15,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Still, wouldn't it be nice if they just had true backwards compatibility?

1085
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:17,505
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess you can't do that when you change formats.

1086
01:16:19,502 --> 01:16:36,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow Well it's going to be backwards compatible It's just obviously you can't Not really though Well There's no UMD drive, big deal It's an antiquated format Alright, moving on What about the digital copies of games I bought?

1087
01:16:36,298 --> 01:16:39,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought 32nd Hero digitally Will I be able to just download that to my Vita?

1088
01:16:40,101 --> 01:16:42,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes Okay, then I'm fine Then that's good

1089
01:16:43,923 --> 01:16:46,525
[SPEAKER_06]: All that stuff is tied to your network account and you can redownload to that.

1090
01:16:46,985 --> 01:16:49,368
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just UMD games.

1091
01:16:49,988 --> 01:16:52,431
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way to transfer that because they're not going to make a UMD drive.

1092
01:16:52,471 --> 01:16:54,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel a little better then.

1093
01:16:55,453 --> 01:17:00,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to information about Super Mario 3D Land, which was of course a big release today.

1094
01:17:00,778 --> 01:17:01,439
[SPEAKER_08]: It came out today.

1095
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:03,421
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are very excited about that.

1096
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:07,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to pick this up at some point amongst all the other games.

1097
01:17:07,845 --> 01:17:08,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

1098
01:17:09,406 --> 01:17:15,990
[SPEAKER_06]: It is one of the games I want to get for the 3DS, but I just don't see myself playing it anytime soon, and I'm in no big hurry.

1099
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:16,830
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Mario game.

1100
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:20,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's going to be good, but it's not like I've got to rush out and go get it.

1101
01:17:20,993 --> 01:17:22,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been hearing a lot of good things about it.

1102
01:17:22,514 --> 01:17:26,616
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting really good reviews, but it's getting lost amongst all the Modern Warfare and Skyrim chatter.

1103
01:17:26,856 --> 01:17:28,978
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is one for the younger crowd, too.

1104
01:17:29,058 --> 01:17:32,440
[SPEAKER_08]: It reminds me a lot of Mario Galaxy, but just in the 3DS.

1105
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:56,403
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's not a bad thing because Mario Galaxy is fucking great but anyway there is a help system in the game a lot of the newer Nintendo games have kind of held your hand a little bit if you constantly fuck up and Mario 3D Land is no different it's been revealed through people playing the game today that if you die twice you'll get a free power up at the beginning of the level like a random power up that happens if you die five times in a level

1106
01:17:57,043 --> 01:18:01,288
[SPEAKER_08]: You get a Tanooki suit that's basically invincibility the whole way through the level.

1107
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:04,571
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like you can't die unless you are just a baddie.

1108
01:18:06,734 --> 01:18:10,918
[SPEAKER_08]: So it really will help you handle... I mean, can you imagine if the original Mario Brothers had did that?

1109
01:18:10,998 --> 01:18:13,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh, you're having problems beating World 8 too?

1110
01:18:14,042 --> 01:18:15,403
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't get through these Hammer Brothers?

1111
01:18:15,723 --> 01:18:17,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, have invincibility through the entire level.

1112
01:18:19,298 --> 01:18:21,640
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just why I saved P-Wings and flew over the whole damn thing.

1113
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:24,462
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where we're at now.

1114
01:18:24,722 --> 01:18:29,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Now here's the interesting thing though is that you're only allowed to do that the first time you beat a level.

1115
01:18:30,065 --> 01:18:35,369
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're trying to go back and look for coins, be a completionist and so forth, you don't get help.

1116
01:18:36,069 --> 01:18:41,773
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're going to go collect coins and shit, you better do it the first time you have that Tanooki suit because you won't be getting it again.

1117
01:18:43,454 --> 01:18:45,396
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the help in Mario 3D.

1118
01:18:46,696 --> 01:18:50,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, what's all this newfangled 3D stuff?

1119
01:18:51,099 --> 01:18:53,100
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember a time when gaming was simpler?

1120
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:56,442
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have all this newfangled 3D Mario Galaxy.

1121
01:18:58,463 --> 01:19:00,024
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we had Super Mario Bros.

1122
01:19:00,044 --> 01:19:00,064
[SPEAKER_08]: 2D.

1123
01:19:02,276 --> 01:19:02,836
[SPEAKER_08]: We liked it.

1124
01:19:03,357 --> 01:19:11,321
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to travel back to a simpler time where DarkSakura is going to get into the Classic Gaming Vault and find a game that she says, Hey, hey, I don't want to hear about your Skyrim.

1125
01:19:11,742 --> 01:19:15,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear about your Modern Warfare, your 3DSs.

1126
01:19:15,604 --> 01:19:17,245
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know about your Skyrim job.

1127
01:19:18,065 --> 01:19:20,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Go play this game because this is Classic Gaming.

1128
01:19:21,232 --> 01:19:24,333
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that you should play the intro to the game.

1129
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:26,694
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are just going to pick it up right from the start.

1130
01:19:26,714 --> 01:19:27,875
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to get it right away.

1131
01:19:27,895 --> 01:19:31,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well then let's go right to the intro of this week's classic game of the week.

1132
01:19:31,316 --> 01:19:39,739
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an oldie goodie.

1133
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe you were like five when this game came out.

1134
01:19:44,841 --> 01:19:46,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I said rock on purpose.

1135
01:19:46,682 --> 01:19:48,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet a lot of our listeners were.

1136
01:19:49,694 --> 01:20:03,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Mega Man X, also known as Rockman X which came out on Super Nintendo or also the Super Famicom in 1993 in Japan 1994 in North America

1137
01:20:05,456 --> 01:20:07,037
[SPEAKER_15]: There's PC versions, yay.

1138
01:20:08,078 --> 01:20:11,920
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is probably one of the best of the series.

1139
01:20:12,801 --> 01:20:21,346
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it's like, in the future, Mega Man X was made by Dr. Light, and stored away in a capsule for 30 years, and Dr. Light probably died.

1140
01:20:22,047 --> 01:20:32,894
[SPEAKER_15]: So this other one named Dr. Kane finds him, and, well, he made a bunch of robots based on X, and they all went crazy, so basically X has to go stop him.

1141
01:20:33,354 --> 01:20:35,555
[SPEAKER_15]: We have zero in this game, that's awesome!

1142
01:20:36,295 --> 01:20:44,278
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, this is what really, I think, where the Mega Man games were really cool, you know?

1143
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:45,819
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've always thought they were really awesome.

1144
01:20:45,839 --> 01:20:55,142
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, though, that having the X series really kind of launched it into the next level, if you'll pardon me for using the phrase.

1145
01:20:56,103 --> 01:20:56,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't you think?

1146
01:20:58,378 --> 01:21:03,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, as it went through, we had more characters.

1147
01:21:03,503 --> 01:21:05,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, there was Zero who was brought in.

1148
01:21:05,565 --> 01:21:10,770
[SPEAKER_15]: There was Axel, Sigma, you know, as the bad guy.

1149
01:21:13,172 --> 01:21:16,635
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, so moving through, there were also, of course, later games.

1150
01:21:16,675 --> 01:21:22,160
[SPEAKER_15]: There was all the way up through Mega Man X8, I think was the last one.

1151
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:28,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

1152
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:34,542
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I meant.

1153
01:21:35,803 --> 01:21:37,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, X8 was the last one.

1154
01:21:37,363 --> 01:21:37,984
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to be sure.

1155
01:21:38,024 --> 01:21:39,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I was pretty sure.

1156
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:43,366
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, we've also had different versions of them.

1157
01:21:43,826 --> 01:21:57,752
[SPEAKER_15]: There's been Mega Man Extreme and Extreme 2, which in Japan was called Rockman X Cyber Mission and Rockman X2 Soul Eraser, which is just a freaking cool name.

1158
01:21:58,512 --> 01:22:03,214
[SPEAKER_15]: We've also had Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, which was the re-release for PSP.

1159
01:22:05,609 --> 01:22:13,813
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, basically, he's got different abilities apart from just, you know, the shooting and, you know, you kill the robot, you get the power, blah, blah, blah.

1160
01:22:14,434 --> 01:22:17,715
[SPEAKER_15]: He can also dash, and you can get an air dash later on.

1161
01:22:18,356 --> 01:22:21,297
[SPEAKER_15]: You get all these power-ups.

1162
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:24,899
[SPEAKER_15]: You can also charge your weapon, too, which is really useful.

1163
01:22:24,919 --> 01:22:32,003
[SPEAKER_15]: That means you can also charge the weapons that you inherit from other Mavericks, so that's pretty cool.

1164
01:22:33,002 --> 01:22:37,943
[SPEAKER_15]: and they have interesting names, some of these Mavericks, like Toxic Seahorse.

1165
01:22:39,764 --> 01:22:48,206
[SPEAKER_15]: But they're pretty much element-based, you know, you get your fire, water, lightning, wind, magnetism, time, all kinds of stuff.

1166
01:22:48,866 --> 01:22:55,608
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, really there's not much else, you know, I can really say about that because it's freakin' Mega Man X and if you haven't played it, where have you been?

1167
01:22:56,368 --> 01:22:56,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Go play it!

1168
01:22:57,608 --> 01:22:59,869
[SPEAKER_15]: There's billions and billions of versions out there to try.

1169
01:23:00,629 --> 01:23:02,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Some comments from our chatroom at chat.org.com.

1170
01:23:02,831 --> 01:23:05,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Hitstun says, actually, I played this game on PC first.

1171
01:23:06,113 --> 01:23:09,975
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a PC demo that was just the intro stage until Sigma showed up, but I thought it was awesome.

1172
01:23:10,195 --> 01:23:11,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I do remember this game on PC, actually.

1173
01:23:12,177 --> 01:23:13,077
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a PC port.

1174
01:23:13,378 --> 01:23:16,199
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an old-ass Mega Man game on PC that was really terrible.

1175
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,400
[SPEAKER_08]: It was only like three stages.

1176
01:23:18,241 --> 01:23:21,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, but that's not X. But anyway, let's see.

1177
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:27,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I got schooled because I said earlier, remember I said back when we didn't have 3D games and all that?

1178
01:23:27,947 --> 01:23:30,189
[SPEAKER_08]: ActDev said we had 3D Rad Racer.

1179
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:32,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I got burned.

1180
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:33,631
[SPEAKER_08]: You did.

1181
01:23:33,671 --> 01:23:34,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.

1182
01:23:34,472 --> 01:23:37,373
[SPEAKER_15]: The shutter glasses that came out with the Master System.

1183
01:23:37,393 --> 01:23:38,014
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was red-blue.

1184
01:23:38,094 --> 01:23:38,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1185
01:23:38,374 --> 01:23:40,956
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but there was Zaxxon 3D.

1186
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

1187
01:23:42,637 --> 01:23:43,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the shutter glasses.

1188
01:23:43,637 --> 01:23:45,579
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so I guess we did have 3D gaming back then.

1189
01:23:45,619 --> 01:23:46,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I got told.

1190
01:23:46,359 --> 01:23:47,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, what are you doing?

1191
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really in the Super Nintendo era.

1192
01:23:49,421 --> 01:23:50,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you playing Saints Row?

1193
01:23:50,302 --> 01:23:52,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki is playing Saints Row with his dildo bat.

1194
01:23:52,883 --> 01:23:54,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to hit somebody in the face with your dildo bat?

1195
01:23:55,465 --> 01:23:55,785
[SPEAKER_08]: You just...

1196
01:23:58,095 --> 01:24:00,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, this is terrible radio if I watch this.

1197
01:24:00,997 --> 01:24:01,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

1198
01:24:01,617 --> 01:24:02,338
[SPEAKER_15]: It's floppy.

1199
01:24:02,358 --> 01:24:04,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Who wants a floppy dildo?

1200
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:11,223
[SPEAKER_08]: He literally threw a guy to the ground and then posed like, hey, like a little swimsuit model pose on the guy.

1201
01:24:11,984 --> 01:24:12,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1202
01:24:14,205 --> 01:24:16,026
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the purpose of having a floppy dildo?

1203
01:24:16,286 --> 01:24:20,048
[SPEAKER_08]: You just kicked that fat guy in the crotch and then whapped him with your dildo.

1204
01:24:20,068 --> 01:24:20,928
[SPEAKER_15]: They kicked a woman.

1205
01:24:21,508 --> 01:24:21,829
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a woman.

1206
01:24:21,849 --> 01:24:22,709
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a woman.

1207
01:24:22,749 --> 01:24:23,429
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a pat.

1208
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:25,750
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a pat.

1209
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:26,611
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1210
01:24:27,331 --> 01:24:28,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, there it is.

1211
01:24:28,792 --> 01:24:30,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Your classic game of the week.

1212
01:24:31,213 --> 01:24:34,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Mega Man X. Good pick, DarkSakura.

1213
01:24:34,174 --> 01:24:34,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Good pick.

1214
01:24:34,694 --> 01:24:35,095
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

1215
01:24:35,215 --> 01:24:35,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1216
01:24:35,715 --> 01:24:35,935
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1217
01:24:36,395 --> 01:24:38,337
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a break, but don't go anywhere.

1218
01:24:38,817 --> 01:24:44,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Those of you on the podcast will only be gone like five seconds, but those of you live, don't go anywhere because we're going to be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio.

1219
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:55,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Your emails, which finally came through, phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, rapid fire news, talk of a Tumblr post that's taking everybody by storm, but I'm going to be a bitch about it.

1220
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:57,250
[SPEAKER_08]: So stay tuned for that.

1221
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:58,210
[SPEAKER_08]: What's new?

1222
01:24:58,491 --> 01:24:58,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

1223
01:24:58,791 --> 01:24:59,351
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

1224
01:25:00,552 --> 01:25:00,752
[SPEAKER_08]: See?

1225
01:25:01,032 --> 01:25:03,994
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back in just a few more minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1226
01:25:04,035 --> 01:25:04,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't go anywhere.

1227
01:25:10,876 --> 01:25:13,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1228
01:25:13,718 --> 01:25:20,161
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live with the 435th episode of our show on this November the 13th of 2011.

1229
01:25:20,802 --> 01:25:26,585
[SPEAKER_08]: And during the break there, I was watching Loki play a little bit of Saints Row the Third, which he has hooked up here in studio, which he's playing.

1230
01:25:27,065 --> 01:25:28,886
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's just running around punching people in the face.

1231
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:30,427
[SPEAKER_08]: This game is very purple.

1232
01:25:30,707 --> 01:25:37,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I know I was getting that in the art and everything, but, like, the game, the knights, the sky is all lit up purple and the paws is purple.

1233
01:25:37,611 --> 01:25:38,132
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1234
01:25:53,021 --> 01:25:53,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

1235
01:25:54,342 --> 01:25:54,662
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1236
01:25:54,702 --> 01:25:55,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there you go.

1237
01:25:55,303 --> 01:25:55,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row.

1238
01:25:57,224 --> 01:25:57,844
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live.

1239
01:25:57,884 --> 01:26:04,068
[SPEAKER_08]: You can join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and comment on some of the rapid-fire news we're about to get to.

1240
01:26:04,128 --> 01:26:07,171
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Loki, you got to pause Saints Row to go over some rapid-fire news.

1241
01:26:07,471 --> 01:26:15,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and we'll talk a little bit more about Saints Row because Saints Row 4 has already been out by the guys over at THQ.

1242
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:16,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Saints Row in Space

1243
01:26:43,258 --> 01:26:44,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki just pointed at me.

1244
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:44,759
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1245
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,521
[SPEAKER_06]: You think that's it?

1246
01:26:46,661 --> 01:26:48,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

1247
01:26:48,823 --> 01:26:51,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you said more over the top than this one.

1248
01:26:51,165 --> 01:26:58,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like, how did the Friday the 13th series end up going, like, just too far over the top by sending Jason to space?

1249
01:26:59,311 --> 01:27:01,173
[SPEAKER_08]: That is part of the DLC, actually.

1250
01:27:01,233 --> 01:27:07,778
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pimps in space, or, like, gangsters in space is literally the...

1251
01:27:09,528 --> 01:27:11,209
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1252
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:44,110
[SPEAKER_06]: and kind of coincidentally also Atlas announced that they're going to be publishing Game of Thrones on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 coming out this March if I remember correctly.

1253
01:27:46,711 --> 01:27:52,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, lots of stuff based on that property I guess because it is pretty good actually.

1254
01:27:52,373 --> 01:27:53,173
[SPEAKER_08]: People like that show.

1255
01:27:54,594 --> 01:28:01,216
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course, last but not least, Dead Island is receiving a patch which will do a few things.

1256
01:28:01,756 --> 01:28:05,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Also going to be raising the level cap to 60.

1257
01:28:07,037 --> 01:28:13,378
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also included some new blueprints for weapon mods added.

1258
01:28:14,258 --> 01:28:17,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Infected damage reduced and a bunch of other gameplay improvements.

1259
01:28:17,799 --> 01:28:24,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Also some fixes to the interface and just improved stability and network performance and co-op and that kind of stuff.

1260
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Neat.

1261
01:28:28,601 --> 01:28:31,823
[SPEAKER_08]: In our chatroom at chat.orange.com, we're a little bit buffered here.

1262
01:28:31,863 --> 01:28:34,044
[SPEAKER_08]: So the chat is just now hearing the Saints Row story.

1263
01:28:34,544 --> 01:28:38,166
[SPEAKER_08]: And Orange Wright in our chatroom says, pimps at sea?

1264
01:28:40,307 --> 01:28:42,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there Saints Row on the ocean?

1265
01:28:42,568 --> 01:28:45,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there pirates versus ninjas in Saints Row?

1266
01:28:45,929 --> 01:28:48,251
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have pirates or ninjas.

1267
01:28:49,171 --> 01:28:52,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know about pirates, but I know you can have ninjas in your gang.

1268
01:28:52,292 --> 01:28:55,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, maybe that's somewhere they could go with it.

1269
01:28:57,196 --> 01:28:59,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Gang Warfare on the high seas.

1270
01:28:59,484 --> 01:29:01,090
[SPEAKER_08]: You can dress up like anything you want.

1271
01:29:03,605 --> 01:29:05,606
[SPEAKER_08]: And GameGuru says, pimps in space?

1272
01:29:05,706 --> 01:29:07,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I really need to get into Saints Row.

1273
01:29:08,889 --> 01:29:09,129
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1274
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:13,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to... And THQ gives you no kickback, Loki, right?

1275
01:29:13,633 --> 01:29:15,375
[SPEAKER_08]: You really are just that big a fanboy for Saints Row?

1276
01:29:15,515 --> 01:29:16,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the game.

1277
01:29:16,316 --> 01:29:16,816
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.

1278
01:29:16,976 --> 01:29:17,417
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1279
01:29:17,857 --> 01:29:18,137
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1280
01:29:18,758 --> 01:29:19,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this game, too.

1281
01:29:19,799 --> 01:29:22,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XIII, and it's getting a sequel.

1282
01:29:22,181 --> 01:29:23,742
[SPEAKER_08]: XIII-2 is coming out.

1283
01:29:24,063 --> 01:29:25,464
[SPEAKER_08]: As if there weren't enough games coming out.

1284
01:29:25,484 --> 01:29:27,806
[SPEAKER_08]: But the good news is this one's not out until early, early next year.

1285
01:29:28,106 --> 01:29:31,467
[SPEAKER_08]: There are going to be some special edition packages for the game.

1286
01:29:31,507 --> 01:29:34,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I'm going to report on what's coming out in Europe.

1287
01:29:34,348 --> 01:29:37,689
[SPEAKER_08]: However, apparently a lot of this is going to be coming to North America as well.

1288
01:29:38,069 --> 01:29:52,834
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is going to be a collector's edition that will come with special packaging and a game, a composer soundtrack CD, an artwork book, six postcards featuring CG artwork of the characters, and a lenticular art print of Lightning, who isn't even the main character in the game, so go figure.

1289
01:29:53,234 --> 01:30:04,658
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also, I guess, a Crystal Edition that comes with all that, but instead of a single CD, you get a four-disc soundtrack, and you get a Final Fantasy XIII-2 t-shirt that you can't get anywhere else.

1290
01:30:05,338 --> 01:30:07,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, I guess like a little presentation box.

1291
01:30:08,259 --> 01:30:16,462
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of the same pre-order stuff will be coming to America as well, because, hey, if you're going to spend $60 on a game, why not spend $80 and get a free t-shirt and soundtrack, huh?

1292
01:30:18,391 --> 01:30:18,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1293
01:30:19,533 --> 01:30:19,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1294
01:30:19,733 --> 01:30:20,775
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to really love that, though.

1295
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:26,463
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some other Black Friday deals here that we wanted to mention real quick.

1296
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:34,655
[SPEAKER_08]: At this part, there is some special bundles coming out, and one of them of note is a Zelda 3DS bundle.

1297
01:30:35,035 --> 01:30:39,036
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be like a special edition, and a lot of these have been cited around the internet.

1298
01:30:39,356 --> 01:30:41,917
[SPEAKER_08]: This is making its way to the US for $179.

1299
01:30:42,557 --> 01:30:46,899
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a black system that comes with The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D.

1300
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:51,160
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also going to be a flare red that comes with Mario 3D Land.

1301
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,821
[SPEAKER_08]: That is both available at Walmart.

1302
01:30:54,321 --> 01:30:57,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently GameStop is also going to have a similar system.

1303
01:30:57,802 --> 01:31:01,244
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, they're not like special branded systems.

1304
01:31:01,264 --> 01:31:04,407
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just the regular... Oh, I thought they had the Zelda artwork on it.

1305
01:31:04,427 --> 01:31:05,847
[SPEAKER_06]: No, only in Europe.

1306
01:31:06,148 --> 01:31:07,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Boo hiss.

1307
01:31:08,389 --> 01:31:10,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, only plain Jane systems for us.

1308
01:31:11,051 --> 01:31:12,992
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was reading about that, I thought it was special.

1309
01:31:13,012 --> 01:31:13,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you clarified.

1310
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Some rumors about the next Xbox.

1311
01:31:16,655 --> 01:31:23,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, the prototype name is Loop, which is good that we have a different name for it now because it's not going to be Xbox 720.

1312
01:31:23,759 --> 01:31:24,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would it be Xbox 720?

1313
01:31:26,221 --> 01:31:27,262
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a huge assumption.

1314
01:31:27,282 --> 01:31:28,042
[SPEAKER_08]: So I like Loop.

1315
01:31:28,843 --> 01:31:32,485
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes me think that now they're naming these after books in the Ring series.

1316
01:31:32,905 --> 01:31:33,546
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

1317
01:31:33,566 --> 01:31:38,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, hey, Xbox 360 had a bunch of rings as their logo, so why not have Loop as the next one?

1318
01:31:39,089 --> 01:31:41,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, I guess it's some type of inside blog.

1319
01:31:41,891 --> 01:31:43,552
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, take it with a grain of salt, whatever.

1320
01:31:44,613 --> 01:31:46,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Loop is the code name for it.

1321
01:31:46,614 --> 01:31:52,358
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to have all this boosted technology called assistive cores inside.

1322
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:57,803
[SPEAKER_08]: including you know graphics, AI, physics, sound, networking, encryption, sensors.

1323
01:31:58,324 --> 01:32:00,326
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be smaller and cheaper than the 360.

1324
01:32:00,767 --> 01:32:03,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming that means when the 360 initially came out.

1325
01:32:04,191 --> 01:32:06,714
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to run on a modified version of Windows 9.

1326
01:32:07,795 --> 01:32:07,975
[SPEAKER_08]: That's

1327
01:32:07,995 --> 01:32:09,796
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not too surprising, really, all things considered.

1328
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:12,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, isn't the Xbox now starting to look more and more like Windows 8?

1329
01:32:13,219 --> 01:32:14,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the prototypes are showing for that?

1330
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:23,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's funny that it's running on Windows 9, and some of the rumors I've been hearing are like, it's going to be out either late next year or early next, you know, 2013.

1331
01:32:23,688 --> 01:32:26,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, so they're going to go through 8 that fast?

1332
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:31,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if it's a modified Windows 9, that leaves a lot of room for interpretation there.

1333
01:32:32,295 --> 01:32:32,735
[SPEAKER_08]: So who knows?

1334
01:32:33,395 --> 01:32:33,516
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1335
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1336
01:32:34,977 --> 01:32:36,959
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have rumors galore.

1337
01:32:36,999 --> 01:32:38,420
[SPEAKER_08]: We won't have anything solid until evening.

1338
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:48,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not surprised either because I think that they're going to be... Windows 8, one of the things about that is they're going to do a lot of compatibility with different ARM processors and stuff.

1339
01:32:48,549 --> 01:32:54,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they're trying to make it so that can run on pretty much everything, that wouldn't surprise me.

1340
01:32:54,855 --> 01:32:57,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does the chat room think I said Xbox 360 Lube?

1341
01:32:57,858 --> 01:32:58,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I say Lube?

1342
01:32:58,639 --> 01:32:59,499
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you said Loop.

1343
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:00,910
[SPEAKER_14]: I said Lube.

1344
01:33:01,051 --> 01:33:01,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Lube would be a fun name.

1345
01:33:02,031 --> 01:33:04,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why they're all like, did he say the Xbox Lube?

1346
01:33:04,893 --> 01:33:06,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Then it would be a smooth move.

1347
01:33:09,357 --> 01:33:11,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I kind of like the name Xbox Lube.

1348
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:13,399
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting you ready.

1349
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:20,625
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be the... That'll be the... Bend over, here we come!

1350
01:33:20,705 --> 01:33:21,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Bend over!

1351
01:33:24,748 --> 01:33:25,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.

1352
01:33:25,248 --> 01:33:29,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, it's now... We are now officially calling the next Xbox the Xbox Lube.

1353
01:33:30,885 --> 01:33:31,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm feeling kind of nauseous now.

1354
01:33:49,575 --> 01:33:53,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Kaijudo says, I like Xbox Blue, but the Blu-ray will slide in better.

1355
01:33:53,438 --> 01:33:56,360
[SPEAKER_15]: So how about some Dragon Quest X?

1356
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:59,302
[SPEAKER_15]: If you are in the Japanese beta, you get a free hat.

1357
01:33:59,522 --> 01:34:00,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Notice I said the Japanese beta.

1358
01:34:01,483 --> 01:34:04,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's only the beta in Japan.

1359
01:34:04,425 --> 01:34:07,387
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to have a Japanese Square Enix account to be able to sign up for it.

1360
01:34:07,467 --> 01:34:10,129
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you're not in Japan, it sucks to be you.

1361
01:34:11,429 --> 01:34:12,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it does suck anyway, but anyway.

1362
01:34:13,430 --> 01:34:15,191
[SPEAKER_15]: So how about some Bioshock Infinite?

1363
01:34:15,351 --> 01:34:20,534
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to have a special move peripheral.

1364
01:34:21,814 --> 01:34:29,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it says it will draw you deeper into this vision of a parallel future, blah, blah, blah.

1365
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:31,239
[SPEAKER_15]: But we don't know what it is.

1366
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:33,120
[SPEAKER_15]: I bet it's a hose.

1367
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, they confirmed that that's not actually happening.

1368
01:34:36,289 --> 01:34:36,449
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1369
01:34:36,749 --> 01:34:37,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1370
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:39,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Saints Row, the third.

1371
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:40,811
[SPEAKER_15]: How about that dildo that you were playing with?

1372
01:34:41,651 --> 01:34:42,372
[SPEAKER_06]: It was floppy.

1373
01:34:43,312 --> 01:34:48,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, for the Japanese version, the penetrator has been censored.

1374
01:34:48,875 --> 01:34:52,836
[SPEAKER_15]: The veins and physics from the dildo was meant to be removed.

1375
01:34:53,937 --> 01:34:57,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they have stricter guidelines on how you can display a phallus.

1376
01:34:57,458 --> 01:34:59,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they also took out the balls as well.

1377
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:03,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not believe the testicles were on the penetrator.

1378
01:35:06,217 --> 01:35:07,639
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very serious, Rob.

1379
01:35:07,659 --> 01:35:08,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you laughing?

1380
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,782
[SPEAKER_08]: They have effectively neutered the weapon.

1381
01:35:13,425 --> 01:35:15,347
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like a purple vibrator now.

1382
01:35:15,367 --> 01:35:17,809
[SPEAKER_06]: It's totally going to throw everything off.

1383
01:35:19,391 --> 01:35:25,337
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite is that all these very serious game blogs had to report, well, yes, they had to make the dildo less veiny.

1384
01:35:26,963 --> 01:35:28,724
[SPEAKER_15]: You had to take out his floppy physics.

1385
01:35:28,744 --> 01:35:30,825
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what would be awesome to have?

1386
01:35:31,905 --> 01:35:45,971
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave this out, and of course they can't do this out over here because it would be tasteless, but in certain other countries like Denmark and Finland or whatever, they were actually shipping them recreations of the Penetrator.

1387
01:35:46,371 --> 01:35:48,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Actual size recreations of the Penetrator.

1388
01:35:48,852 --> 01:35:51,513
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a giant four foot long dildo on a stick.

1389
01:35:52,988 --> 01:35:53,708
[SPEAKER_15]: On a baseball bat.

1390
01:35:53,908 --> 01:35:57,290
[SPEAKER_06]: On a baseball bat that these blog people had.

1391
01:35:57,650 --> 01:35:59,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I would display that proudly.

1392
01:35:59,651 --> 01:36:00,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking for pictures.

1393
01:36:02,272 --> 01:36:03,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to Kotaku.

1394
01:36:03,772 --> 01:36:04,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Kotaku has them.

1395
01:36:05,433 --> 01:36:08,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, because she's got to post them in the Orange Launch Radio Tumblr account.

1396
01:36:08,294 --> 01:36:10,115
[SPEAKER_08]: So we haven't really been posting a lot over there tonight.

1397
01:36:10,195 --> 01:36:11,215
[SPEAKER_08]: So here you go.

1398
01:36:12,396 --> 01:36:12,736
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1399
01:36:15,117 --> 01:36:18,718
[SPEAKER_15]: They show what it looks like in Japan, and it's... Rigid.

1400
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:19,979
[SPEAKER_15]: Very rigid.

1401
01:36:20,039 --> 01:36:20,619
[SPEAKER_15]: That looks painful.

1402
01:36:23,303 --> 01:36:27,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on to talking about... This is actually from Tumblr.

1403
01:36:27,384 --> 01:36:29,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to talk about this real quick before we get into some long-form news.

1404
01:36:30,104 --> 01:36:33,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I saw this around Twitter, and this is a nice story.

1405
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:37,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to share this nice story with you guys and see what you guys think about it, okay?

1406
01:36:37,806 --> 01:36:42,207
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I got to abridge this because I don't want to read this verbatim.

1407
01:36:42,667 --> 01:36:44,267
[SPEAKER_08]: But where is this coming from?

1408
01:36:44,287 --> 01:36:48,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the original Tumblr user that posted this was iHeartChaos.

1409
01:36:48,968 --> 01:36:49,849
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1410
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:13,867
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually had sold a bunch of his Yu-Gi-Oh cards and did housework for his parents to get it.

1411
01:37:14,647 --> 01:37:18,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And the guy who wrote this said, I had an idea, save my place in line.

1412
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:25,334
[SPEAKER_08]: And he went through the line, told other people about the situation, collected a bunch of money, five bucks here and there and so forth.

1413
01:37:25,754 --> 01:37:29,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was able to raise the money for a new copy, bought the kid a new copy.

1414
01:37:29,777 --> 01:37:32,339
[SPEAKER_08]: And the kid was very thankful about it and so forth.

1415
01:37:32,359 --> 01:37:34,160
[SPEAKER_08]: And the kid said, do you need anything in return?

1416
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:40,303
[SPEAKER_08]: and the guy says, I told him, young man, I just hope one day you'll do something equally nice for someone.

1417
01:37:40,984 --> 01:37:44,506
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it's a very inspiring, pay it forward type of story, right?

1418
01:37:44,566 --> 01:37:45,867
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's very, very nice.

1419
01:37:48,227 --> 01:37:54,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I read this on Twitter and I was like, that's sweet, but I'm going to be a bitch here because there's something kind of really wrong with this story.

1420
01:37:55,493 --> 01:37:56,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Did anyone else pick up on it?

1421
01:37:56,934 --> 01:37:58,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, I picked up on it.

1422
01:37:58,215 --> 01:37:59,396
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you pick up on, Loki?

1423
01:37:59,576 --> 01:38:03,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I picked up on the fact, first off, it's a child playing an M-rated game.

1424
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,520
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, Loki.

1425
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:09,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I said at the very beginning, it was a 13-year-old who rolled his bike and sold his Yu-Gi-Oh cards to get the game.

1426
01:38:09,544 --> 01:38:10,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it a midnight launch?

1427
01:38:10,665 --> 01:38:11,826
[SPEAKER_08]: At a midnight launch.

1428
01:38:12,267 --> 01:38:13,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, his parents are wonderful.

1429
01:38:14,308 --> 01:38:21,735
[SPEAKER_08]: If, now, this is going to sound really rude, but this is the point when you start to look at situations like that, do you go, is this story real?

1430
01:38:22,696 --> 01:38:23,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the story's not real.

1431
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:32,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, and I know that sounds like a horrible thing to say, but I think I have a right to be skeptical, because what parent lets a 13-year-old ride their bike at midnight at night?

1432
01:38:33,635 --> 01:38:37,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess there's some crazy people out there, but it does leave me positive.

1433
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:41,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and see what happens when you do let your 13-year-old out at midnight.

1434
01:38:41,887 --> 01:38:44,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, why are people robbing people of games?

1435
01:38:45,873 --> 01:38:47,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that part's shitty.

1436
01:38:47,376 --> 01:38:49,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Go steal it from a store or something.

1437
01:38:49,719 --> 01:38:58,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, you know, and then there's that part and it makes me go, well, you know, that definitely could be legit that somebody's going to steal an Xbox game right out of a kid's hands.

1438
01:38:58,704 --> 01:39:00,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's really fucking classy.

1439
01:39:00,525 --> 01:39:06,007
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, there's some people in this world that are just not have no class whatsoever and would do something like that.

1440
01:39:07,308 --> 01:39:13,731
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, there's also that part of me that's like, but it's a 13-year-old trying to buy an M-rated game.

1441
01:39:14,131 --> 01:39:20,675
[SPEAKER_08]: The game starts, I don't mean to be all spoilery, but within the first five minutes of playing Skyrim, you're going to see some guy get his head chopped off.

1442
01:39:21,515 --> 01:39:22,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1443
01:39:22,275 --> 01:39:23,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Old-style execution style.

1444
01:39:24,156 --> 01:39:26,658
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, do you want your 13-year-old to see that?

1445
01:39:27,358 --> 01:39:28,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not.

1446
01:39:28,538 --> 01:39:30,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, some 13-year-olds can probably handle it.

1447
01:39:30,279 --> 01:39:30,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, come on.

1448
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:33,421
[SPEAKER_15]: I watched Red Sonja when I was, what, seven?

1449
01:39:33,761 --> 01:39:35,002
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was your parents' choice.

1450
01:39:36,082 --> 01:39:36,562
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it wasn't.

1451
01:39:36,963 --> 01:39:43,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you didn't ride two miles in the dark at midnight to go do it.

1452
01:39:43,287 --> 01:39:45,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the parents let the kid did this.

1453
01:39:46,389 --> 01:39:49,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the parents let the kid did this, and that's fine, whatever, he's not my kid.

1454
01:39:49,531 --> 01:39:56,916
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I go, but the store effectively allowed this perfect stranger to buy an M-rated game for a 13-year-old.

1455
01:39:57,376 --> 01:40:00,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, regardless of the reason, isn't that not supposed to be happening?

1456
01:40:01,819 --> 01:40:02,960
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not supposed to be happening.

1457
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:03,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1458
01:40:04,463 --> 01:40:09,749
[SPEAKER_08]: So, now my other question is, am I a bitch for my mind instantly going here?

1459
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:11,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me... Yes.

1460
01:40:11,951 --> 01:40:15,255
[SPEAKER_08]: On a feel-good, warm, fuzzy-wuzzy, gamers-do-good story.

1461
01:40:16,597 --> 01:40:21,762
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he didn't do good, because he basically bought the... He should have... I don't know, whatever.

1462
01:40:21,802 --> 01:40:23,364
[SPEAKER_06]: His parents should have taken care of it.

1463
01:40:25,327 --> 01:40:27,069
[SPEAKER_08]: So, alright.

1464
01:40:27,129 --> 01:40:29,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it wrong that I'm color correcting this picture of a dildo?

1465
01:40:30,433 --> 01:40:31,294
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just really bored.

1466
01:40:31,614 --> 01:40:33,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, wait a minute, you're doing a show, how can you be bored?

1467
01:40:33,997 --> 01:40:34,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1468
01:40:34,698 --> 01:40:40,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm... Moving on, let's get to some more gaming news, Loki.

1469
01:40:40,825 --> 01:40:43,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, you know, one of the things that...

1470
01:40:45,871 --> 01:40:46,993
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1471
01:41:04,355 --> 01:41:06,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Say I didn't want to play online.

1472
01:41:06,356 --> 01:41:08,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Say I bought the game because it has System Link.

1473
01:41:09,338 --> 01:41:10,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Praise System Link.

1474
01:41:10,598 --> 01:41:10,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1475
01:41:11,959 --> 01:41:15,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to play with my friend over System Link.

1476
01:41:15,881 --> 01:41:18,022
[SPEAKER_06]: In order for me to do that, I have to put in an online pass code.

1477
01:41:18,122 --> 01:41:18,462
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1478
01:41:19,183 --> 01:41:26,767
[SPEAKER_06]: If I bought this game used and I had no intention to play it online at all, I wanted to play it System Link, I would have to pay $10 to get a code.

1479
01:41:27,527 --> 01:41:28,948
[SPEAKER_06]: An online pass to play offline!

1480
01:41:30,876 --> 01:41:31,657
[SPEAKER_06]: What is up with that?

1481
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:33,419
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, that is the case.

1482
01:41:35,161 --> 01:41:37,744
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a screenshot of the actual online passcode.

1483
01:41:37,924 --> 01:41:39,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I have my own online passcode.

1484
01:41:40,327 --> 01:41:42,349
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, you can't do it.

1485
01:41:42,469 --> 01:41:47,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and of course, because the copy is early, it's not actually on the site yet.

1486
01:41:47,775 --> 01:41:50,458
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't actually play co-op with anybody yet.

1487
01:41:51,519 --> 01:41:52,600
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's fucked up.

1488
01:41:53,841 --> 01:42:01,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I thought the whole point of these online passes... And it's not even me calling it an online pass.

1489
01:42:01,606 --> 01:42:04,609
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, you know, okay, this is an Ubi Uplay thing.

1490
01:42:04,649 --> 01:42:06,530
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to unlock bonus contents.

1491
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:09,032
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, your online pass code.

1492
01:42:10,233 --> 01:42:17,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I'm not playing this online, and the whole reason that you're charging this is because online servers cost money to run, then...

1493
01:42:18,993 --> 01:42:21,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Then basically you're just taking money for the hell of it.

1494
01:42:21,934 --> 01:42:24,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1495
01:42:24,475 --> 01:42:26,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you should have had System Link outside of it.

1496
01:42:26,615 --> 01:42:28,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, here's why they don't have System Link outside of it.

1497
01:42:28,836 --> 01:42:30,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they know this game is going to get pirated.

1498
01:42:30,396 --> 01:42:36,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also know that there are ways that you can play online co-op with somebody else via System Link.

1499
01:42:38,038 --> 01:43:04,209
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's why they put this behind a code because if they're going to at least make some money off this pirated copy if you're going to play online and play co-op whether it be through System Link or whatever then they're going to make $10 off it that's the true reason why it's like this but still for legitimate people that want to play this game say buy it used or whatever in other words it's a further case of legitimate buyers getting screwed over anti-piracy measures that will get hacked to shit anyway

1500
01:43:04,329 --> 01:43:07,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, because I agree this game's awesome and you should buy it.

1501
01:43:08,111 --> 01:43:12,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, if you can buy it new, great, because I think you should play it sooner than later.

1502
01:43:12,273 --> 01:43:20,376
[SPEAKER_06]: But not everyone can buy it new and you shouldn't be expected to have to pony out, you know, money for something that maybe you're not sure that you'd like it or something.

1503
01:43:20,396 --> 01:43:27,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, granted, but when you do buy the game new, you don't, I mean, we have to remember that online passes don't affect those that buy new.

1504
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:27,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1505
01:43:29,121 --> 01:43:56,323
[SPEAKER_06]: but it still it still ain't well and actually no it does kind of affect me if buying a new because I play on a lot of different systems at work so if I want to play System Link Co-op now I can only play on my system and you know I'd have to get another copy new you can't like download the data to USB and then go to a friend's house and put the USB in there no I don't think so I think it's tied to your system it might be tied to your account you might be able to do it

1506
01:43:56,923 --> 01:44:04,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But even still, though, I would have to log in online anyways to play System Link, you know, because you have to download its DLC, basically.

1507
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:07,032
[SPEAKER_08]: So DLC is usually tied to your system.

1508
01:44:07,172 --> 01:44:07,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1509
01:44:08,913 --> 01:44:12,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can't play the same account on two systems to System Link, can you?

1510
01:44:12,517 --> 01:44:13,257
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1511
01:44:13,337 --> 01:44:14,078
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's the trick.

1512
01:44:14,698 --> 01:44:17,281
[SPEAKER_08]: So you are kind of getting screwed in that regard.

1513
01:44:18,642 --> 01:44:18,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1514
01:44:20,932 --> 01:44:29,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's a good thing to know before the game comes out, I think, especially for people who might be considering buying it, waiting to get it used or whatever.

1515
01:44:29,198 --> 01:44:30,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing, though.

1516
01:44:30,439 --> 01:44:32,461
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't tell anybody it was going to have this.

1517
01:44:33,582 --> 01:44:38,466
[SPEAKER_06]: It just happened to be a reviewer or whatever said, hey, it has an online pass.

1518
01:44:38,546 --> 01:44:39,427
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something to report on.

1519
01:44:39,747 --> 01:44:41,188
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't tell anybody.

1520
01:44:41,288 --> 01:44:43,170
[SPEAKER_06]: If that reviewer hadn't said anything...

1521
01:44:44,262 --> 01:44:50,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure obviously it's going to get out there early and people would say something, but let's just say, devil's advocate here, that no one said anything.

1522
01:44:50,846 --> 01:44:52,106
[SPEAKER_06]: THQ would have not said anything.

1523
01:44:52,346 --> 01:44:55,728
[SPEAKER_06]: You would get home with your copy of the game and you're like, what the fuck is this?

1524
01:44:57,269 --> 01:44:58,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And they already have your 60 bucks.

1525
01:44:58,449 --> 01:45:01,231
[SPEAKER_08]: But now you're getting used to seeing those things in every game.

1526
01:45:03,494 --> 01:45:20,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem with games that if they want to charge that because they're saying we need to fund our servers or whatever the case may be and it's an online game I have a problem with it on Xbox 360 I'm already paying $50 a month for that

1527
01:45:21,658 --> 01:45:23,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are Microsoft games allowed to charge for this?

1528
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:28,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, granted, Microsoft first-party games haven't done it because they know better.

1529
01:45:31,043 --> 01:45:36,546
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go ape shit on them when they try to pull that shit because that's true double-dipping right there.

1530
01:45:37,086 --> 01:45:40,188
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now, it's really only the third parties that are doing it.

1531
01:45:40,228 --> 01:45:41,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And now Sony, but Sony...

1532
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:59,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony's online thing is free already I give this way more justification on the Playstation than I do on the Xbox because I'm already paying $50 a month to play online on the Xbox that's kind of what pisses me off about the online pass in that regard but anyhow

1533
01:46:01,668 --> 01:46:03,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumors abound that a new Zelda game is on its way.

1534
01:46:04,090 --> 01:46:06,692
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being made for the 3DS.

1535
01:46:06,832 --> 01:46:13,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Series producer Eiji Onuma talked to a Portuguese website, MyGames, and said the following, quote,

1536
01:46:22,483 --> 01:46:26,804
[SPEAKER_08]: We are talking about a new game, but it takes much of what has been done on previous handhelds.

1537
01:46:27,224 --> 01:46:30,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Some folks are saying, is this sort of Majora's Mask?

1538
01:46:30,865 --> 01:46:32,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually thinking no.

1539
01:46:32,325 --> 01:46:38,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, you know, I'm kind of reading really a lot into this, but I think it's definitely a new Zelda title, which kind of seems like a duh.

1540
01:46:38,827 --> 01:46:40,487
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be the major Nintendo franchises.

1541
01:46:40,847 --> 01:46:43,128
[SPEAKER_08]: But look at everything that's kind of been leading up to this.

1542
01:46:43,168 --> 01:46:51,730
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Nintendo has been talking about, yeah, we need more big releases on the 3DS, and we have some things that are coming in 2012 that we're not ready to announce yet.

1543
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:57,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Zelda 3DS is probably the big thing that's being unveiled next E3 on the 3DS.

1544
01:46:58,697 --> 01:46:59,618
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, duh, right?

1545
01:47:02,581 --> 01:47:07,587
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gonna be some big first-party game, and if they're gonna refuse to give me F-Zero another year...

1546
01:47:09,368 --> 01:47:24,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it's going to be probably Zelda Most likely This doesn't surprise me at all And I don't want it to be Majora's Mask I get that some people want that remade too, whatever, fine But I think I'd rather just have a new Zelda game Why not a new experience?

1547
01:47:27,082 --> 01:47:33,588
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mario game's apparently pretty good So they're capable of taking the old franchises and making them fun in 3D Why not Zelda?

1548
01:47:35,549 --> 01:47:37,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it'll be a new game It'll be cool

1549
01:47:38,570 --> 01:47:40,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it won't take five years to develop.

1550
01:47:40,772 --> 01:47:41,292
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see though.

1551
01:47:42,092 --> 01:47:42,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to the mailbag.

1552
01:47:43,994 --> 01:47:55,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura is going to dive into the email bag and pick out the one email that came in this week that's worth reading.

1553
01:47:55,841 --> 01:47:56,802
[SPEAKER_08]: All the rest of it is spam.

1554
01:47:58,283 --> 01:48:05,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeDanceRadio.com I realize a lot of you have been busy playing Modern Warfare and Skyrim and Mario and so forth, but let's make her work next week.

1555
01:48:06,465 --> 01:48:09,226
[SPEAKER_08]: No opinions on the panel tonight about Modern Warfare.

1556
01:48:09,366 --> 01:48:10,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I need emails on Modern Warfare.

1557
01:48:11,367 --> 01:48:14,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me why this sold 9 million copies or whatever the first day.

1558
01:48:14,508 --> 01:48:15,248
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to understand.

1559
01:48:15,848 --> 01:48:19,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not hating on the game, I just want to know... I'm not hating on it.

1560
01:48:19,629 --> 01:48:20,190
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not my...

1561
01:48:22,526 --> 01:48:25,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to know why other people get so riled up about it.

1562
01:48:51,049 --> 01:48:53,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks guys, Sundays are orange forever, Jim Sally

1563
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:15,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say the best holiday deal I ever got was my HDTV for $600.

1564
01:49:16,024 --> 01:49:18,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind this was in the year, I think, 2004.

1565
01:49:19,447 --> 01:49:20,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it at Costco.

1566
01:49:20,428 --> 01:49:22,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was back when HDTVs were not flat.

1567
01:49:23,351 --> 01:49:25,953
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the giant backs like the old school TVs still.

1568
01:49:26,053 --> 01:49:27,594
[SPEAKER_08]: That thing was heavy as hell.

1569
01:49:28,515 --> 01:49:29,917
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a big TV.

1570
01:49:30,057 --> 01:49:35,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I get that when I was living with you, Loki, or was that when I was living with Extifer that I finally got that?

1571
01:49:36,516 --> 01:49:40,538
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was only $600, which then was like dirt cheap for an HDTV.

1572
01:49:40,578 --> 01:49:42,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you remember that TV, DarkSakura.

1573
01:49:43,079 --> 01:49:44,680
[SPEAKER_08]: You know where you can see that TV?

1574
01:49:46,481 --> 01:49:51,204
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the news report that Channel 3 did on us that somebody put up on YouTube.

1575
01:49:52,124 --> 01:49:54,225
[SPEAKER_08]: You're playing DDR on that old TV.

1576
01:49:54,245 --> 01:49:54,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see.

1577
01:49:54,786 --> 01:49:55,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1578
01:49:57,711 --> 01:49:59,152
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a good time to revisit that music too.

1579
01:49:59,172 --> 01:50:02,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I was playing DVR on... You were playing on the cabinet.

1580
01:50:02,495 --> 01:50:03,115
[SPEAKER_08]: On the cabinet.

1581
01:50:03,435 --> 01:50:04,316
[SPEAKER_15]: You were playing on the cabinet.

1582
01:50:04,796 --> 01:50:05,177
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

1583
01:50:05,217 --> 01:50:06,558
[SPEAKER_08]: That was when the B did the article.

1584
01:50:06,598 --> 01:50:12,883
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the Sacramento B. Well, the one with the rock band, not rock band, but guitar hero was here at my house.

1585
01:50:13,283 --> 01:50:13,643
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

1586
01:50:13,823 --> 01:50:15,965
[SPEAKER_06]: He's talking about the... On my old TV.

1587
01:50:16,125 --> 01:50:20,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you remember the It's So Much Fun story?

1588
01:50:20,348 --> 01:50:21,649
[SPEAKER_06]: It's So Much Fun.

1589
01:50:21,689 --> 01:50:22,890
[SPEAKER_08]: That led to that whole thing.

1590
01:50:22,930 --> 01:50:23,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you remember that?

1591
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:26,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, look, I found it.

1592
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:27,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I found it.

1593
01:50:27,101 --> 01:50:27,921
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still on YouTube.

1594
01:50:27,941 --> 01:50:28,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at this.

1595
01:50:28,781 --> 01:50:32,402
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor is one of the many people joining the podcasting craze.

1596
01:50:32,482 --> 01:50:35,163
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming a web craze, but what is it?

1597
01:50:35,303 --> 01:50:35,863
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it work?

1598
01:50:35,943 --> 01:50:43,506
[SPEAKER_00]: KCRA 3's Brian Hickey tonight shows us how people are using podcasting to inform, entertain, and share their thoughts with the world.

1599
01:50:46,648 --> 01:50:53,572
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Dance Dance Revolution, or DDR, a popular game There, there's the ginormous TV, remember that guy?

1600
01:50:53,712 --> 01:51:12,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I got that for 600 bucks, I was a steal back then October 9th, 2006, but anyway, now that I have this up I was thinking of the Vega, but the Vega was, um, dude's TV Now that we're, this is a five year old clip now, now I want to watch the rest No, I don't want to watch it It started off tiny and it's grown

1601
01:51:15,290 --> 01:51:16,071
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what she said.

1602
01:51:18,553 --> 01:51:19,593
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we're not playing this.

1603
01:51:19,914 --> 01:51:21,415
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I gotta hear that again.

1604
01:51:22,075 --> 01:51:24,157
[SPEAKER_12]: It started off tiny and it's grown.

1605
01:51:25,157 --> 01:51:26,899
[SPEAKER_04]: A subculture of pop culture.

1606
01:51:27,239 --> 01:51:30,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the voices to unite and inform the gaming fans.

1607
01:51:30,562 --> 01:51:31,462
[SPEAKER_04]: A cliche thing.

1608
01:51:31,502 --> 01:51:32,683
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a cliche thing.

1609
01:51:32,703 --> 01:51:34,665
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

1610
01:51:36,101 --> 01:51:45,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, everybody, once again, and welcome to another... Remember that ginormous green chair we had randomly in the old studio in the Extifer apartment?

1611
01:51:45,665 --> 01:51:46,965
[SPEAKER_15]: The one I would sleep in sometimes?

1612
01:51:46,985 --> 01:51:48,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, that chair is gigantic.

1613
01:51:48,626 --> 01:51:49,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry.

1614
01:51:49,046 --> 01:51:50,687
[SPEAKER_04]: ...episode of our podcast.

1615
01:51:51,067 --> 01:51:54,829
[SPEAKER_04]: From their apartment in Rancho Cordova, using revolutionary technology...

1616
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:56,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god.

1617
01:51:56,350 --> 01:51:58,252
[SPEAKER_15]: That was my old laptop that's in the garage now.

1618
01:51:58,452 --> 01:52:00,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Look how young we are in this picture.

1619
01:52:00,314 --> 01:52:01,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially look at Loki.

1620
01:52:01,936 --> 01:52:03,478
[SPEAKER_08]: He looks so much younger in this clip.

1621
01:52:03,919 --> 01:52:04,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had hair.

1622
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:05,541
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing.

1623
01:52:05,581 --> 01:52:06,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I look the same.

1624
01:52:06,261 --> 01:52:07,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll do that to you.

1625
01:52:07,803 --> 01:52:08,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Except your hair is shorter.

1626
01:52:09,025 --> 01:52:10,226
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a different color.

1627
01:52:12,128 --> 01:52:17,933
[SPEAKER_15]: basically give the news for video games, popular culture, basically what gamers really want to know.

1628
01:52:18,353 --> 01:52:24,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Using a computer, podcast producers record their programs, then send them to a number of websites now hosting the shows.

1629
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:33,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Now anyone can create, edit, and air their ideas, concerns, music, and all things audio to anyone else willing to download it.

1630
01:52:33,767 --> 01:52:34,988
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something they can take with them.

1631
01:52:35,368 --> 01:52:38,631
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a much more flexible way of spreading the information.

1632
01:52:39,141 --> 01:52:43,907
[SPEAKER_04]: With nothing more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones, you can listen to it anywhere.

1633
01:52:44,147 --> 01:52:47,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that they just interviewed some random dude bro, like who had his iPod with him.

1634
01:52:48,072 --> 01:52:49,413
[SPEAKER_08]: He's skating down the street.

1635
01:52:49,454 --> 01:52:54,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Now people can talk about things they like to talk about and other people can join in and listen to.

1636
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:56,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really open and...

1637
01:52:59,030 --> 01:53:01,831
[SPEAKER_04]: A number of websites are now hosting the podcast for free.

1638
01:53:02,031 --> 01:53:05,893
[SPEAKER_04]: The newest and biggest database to adopt the technology is Apple's iTunes.

1639
01:53:06,653 --> 01:53:13,696
[SPEAKER_04]: You just click on the podcast tab, type a topic in the search feature, and a list of available podcasts are at your fingertips.

1640
01:53:14,096 --> 01:53:17,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Free for you, free for the producers, free speech for everyone.

1641
01:53:18,538 --> 01:53:19,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's so much fun.

1642
01:53:19,738 --> 01:53:20,259
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

1643
01:53:20,319 --> 01:53:22,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they can go eat a dick, okay?

1644
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:37,149
[SPEAKER_08]: interview me for a minute and a half let's play this two second clip they never show Loki's name, his real name they never show anything but that one little clip, oh it's so much fun and then me talking about something a little more profound

1645
01:53:38,117 --> 01:53:39,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Free for the producers.

1646
01:53:39,398 --> 01:53:40,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Free speech for everyone.

1647
01:53:41,839 --> 01:53:42,520
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so much fun.

1648
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:49,224
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great that, you know, just anybody out there who really has a desire to want to be heard, you have an outlet for your voice to get out there.

1649
01:53:49,304 --> 01:53:51,026
[SPEAKER_07]: So podcasting is just wonderful.

1650
01:53:51,666 --> 01:53:54,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Ian Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey, KCRA 3 Reports.

1651
01:53:55,729 --> 01:53:57,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say more than everybody.

1652
01:53:57,310 --> 01:53:58,290
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of cool.

1653
01:53:58,330 --> 01:54:01,793
[SPEAKER_00]: ...began providing his weekly radio address as a podcast.

1654
01:54:02,093 --> 01:54:07,537
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be downloaded so you can listen to it in your car as you walk or even as you're pumping iron.

1655
01:54:08,758 --> 01:54:12,120
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, we were mentioned in the same breath as Governor Schwarzenegger.

1656
01:54:12,161 --> 01:54:14,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, he really was the governor of California, if you weren't aware.

1657
01:54:14,503 --> 01:54:16,124
[SPEAKER_08]: He really, really was the governor.

1658
01:54:16,344 --> 01:54:18,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you notice that overhead cam shot trying to get my boobs?

1659
01:54:20,628 --> 01:54:21,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously!

1660
01:54:21,288 --> 01:54:22,429
[SPEAKER_08]: That cameraman fancied you.

1661
01:54:23,110 --> 01:54:24,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever, it's just because I'm a girl.

1662
01:54:25,972 --> 01:54:30,496
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, here's my favorite thing about that whole story.

1663
01:54:31,197 --> 01:54:32,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Our show is never named.

1664
01:54:34,301 --> 01:54:37,425
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want to have free advertising.

1665
01:54:37,765 --> 01:54:41,889
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you watch him search, he's searching for Orange Lounge Radio.

1666
01:54:41,929 --> 01:54:43,151
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the shout out we got.

1667
01:54:43,751 --> 01:54:47,015
[SPEAKER_08]: But never did they say, these three guys produce a show called Orange Lounge Radio.

1668
01:54:47,375 --> 01:54:50,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, they play DDR and it's so much fun.

1669
01:54:50,619 --> 01:54:52,982
[SPEAKER_08]: It started off tiny and it's grown.

1670
01:54:55,970 --> 01:55:10,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Cutting Edge Technology These failed things called computers These guys are doing what Governor Schwarzenegger's doing Pumping iron Doing drugs Making poor decisions

1671
01:55:15,126 --> 01:55:16,327
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on.

1672
01:55:16,927 --> 01:55:17,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it for emails?

1673
01:55:18,708 --> 01:55:19,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, holiday deals.

1674
01:55:19,949 --> 01:55:24,252
[SPEAKER_08]: We took a trip down memory lane and just totally ignored Jim Sally's question.

1675
01:55:24,272 --> 01:55:24,872
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no more emails.

1676
01:55:24,893 --> 01:55:25,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mentioned the TV.

1677
01:55:26,313 --> 01:55:28,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Did anybody else get any really good holiday deals that they can remember?

1678
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:29,415
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember.

1679
01:55:29,435 --> 01:55:29,776
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care.

1680
01:55:30,736 --> 01:55:44,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I used to buy like, uh, different like media and stuff, you know, like CD blanks and stuff like that because you usually have, uh, some good deals on those at least during the holidays.

1681
01:55:44,206 --> 01:55:47,068
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the only thing I could see you like going to like Best Buy or something for.

1682
01:55:49,139 --> 01:55:49,479
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1683
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:54,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you want to send us some emails in the future.

1684
01:55:54,621 --> 01:55:54,901
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1685
01:55:54,961 --> 01:55:59,043
[SPEAKER_08]: After that trip down memory lane, I'm sure that's going to ignite some fury amongst some people.

1686
01:55:59,483 --> 01:56:01,264
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a part of the show we call the FUs of the Week.

1687
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:22,401
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1688
01:56:23,043 --> 01:56:24,306
[SPEAKER_15]: It gets us to feeling crappy.

1689
01:56:25,563 --> 01:56:27,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, F you to Feeling Crappy.

1690
01:56:27,545 --> 01:56:28,466
[SPEAKER_15]: And F you to Shane.

1691
01:56:30,308 --> 01:56:31,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is he getting an F you?

1692
01:56:31,469 --> 01:56:39,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I've listened to a lot of Manson, and every time, I can't help it, he's got me liking a group that I can't get any new stuff from anymore.

1693
01:56:40,397 --> 01:56:42,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, didn't they break up years ago?

1694
01:56:42,439 --> 01:56:45,322
[SPEAKER_15]: Years ago, but I just recently heard of them thanks to him.

1695
01:56:45,342 --> 01:56:46,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't someone from that group die too?

1696
01:56:46,884 --> 01:56:49,146
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, but I'm mad at Shane.

1697
01:56:50,687 --> 01:56:51,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Only marginally.

1698
01:56:51,708 --> 01:56:54,730
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also mad at Shane for not catching up on Supernatural.

1699
01:56:55,850 --> 01:56:57,351
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can't talk to him about it.

1700
01:56:57,891 --> 01:56:58,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1701
01:56:58,532 --> 01:57:03,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I love our chat room because we were talking about the similarities between Orange Launch Radio and Governor Schwarzenegger, right?

1702
01:57:03,815 --> 01:57:06,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Kasson in the chat says, which one of the OLR hosts diddled the maid?

1703
01:57:07,937 --> 01:57:13,758
[SPEAKER_08]: and SalaciousPop follows that up saying, is OLR going to suddenly reveal a 10-year-old offspring from a Latina domestic servant?

1704
01:57:14,018 --> 01:57:15,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's something Governor Schwarzenegger did.

1705
01:57:16,039 --> 01:57:17,119
[SPEAKER_08]: The show is the right age.

1706
01:57:17,499 --> 01:57:19,380
[SPEAKER_08]: We got really drunk after our second episode.

1707
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:20,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ask how this happened.

1708
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:25,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I'm the only one that's, you know, physically capable of that, so shut up.

1709
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:27,481
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Loki or I could have boinked a maid.

1710
01:57:28,582 --> 01:57:31,722
[SPEAKER_15]: But, oh, that's right, I'm not a Latina maid.

1711
01:57:32,743 --> 01:57:34,243
[SPEAKER_08]: You definitely are not a Latina maid.

1712
01:57:36,487 --> 01:57:37,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, FUs of the week.

1713
01:57:38,027 --> 01:57:39,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1714
01:57:39,728 --> 01:57:48,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say my FU goes to those people I'm not sure if you've seen these but they have these little signs that show how fast you're going and stuff like that.

1715
01:57:49,191 --> 01:57:52,673
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a reminder to do the speed limit or under the speed limit.

1716
01:57:52,733 --> 01:57:55,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I always, always speed up when I see those.

1717
01:57:55,994 --> 01:57:59,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I see people, like, see those signs and they, like, slam on their brakes.

1718
01:57:59,597 --> 01:58:01,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, dude, it's a fucking sign.

1719
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:03,219
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not gonna write you a ticket.

1720
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:04,180
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a sign.

1721
01:58:04,580 --> 01:58:07,402
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it does, is it shows you how fast you're going.

1722
01:58:07,702 --> 01:58:09,303
[SPEAKER_06]: And not accurately, by the way.

1723
01:58:09,704 --> 01:58:15,308
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite thing to find out with those signs is how high it will track you before it starts getting angry and starts blinking.

1724
01:58:16,128 --> 01:58:19,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I always like to see, like, what's the speed limit where it starts flashing slow down, asshole?

1725
01:58:20,805 --> 01:58:26,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, so I feed those people that think signs are real, people that are gonna, you know, write them tickets or something.

1726
01:58:26,911 --> 01:58:28,192
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have a magical camera on it.

1727
01:58:28,212 --> 01:58:30,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure someday the signs will be able to write you a ticket.

1728
01:58:31,915 --> 01:58:33,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Governments are hard up enough for the money.

1729
01:58:33,937 --> 01:58:34,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1730
01:58:34,898 --> 01:58:38,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, my FU of the week goes to the headache I had today.

1731
01:58:39,182 --> 01:58:44,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Because headaches are terrible, and, yeah, it made me want to nap all day, forever.

1732
01:58:45,544 --> 01:58:46,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Make you feel better, Rob?

1733
01:58:46,685 --> 01:58:48,166
[SPEAKER_08]: What, the giant purple dildo?

1734
01:58:48,406 --> 01:58:48,666
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1735
01:58:49,787 --> 01:58:50,968
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not make me feel better.

1736
01:58:52,889 --> 01:58:53,629
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of want one.

1737
01:58:55,331 --> 01:58:56,511
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd hang it up in the studio.

1738
01:58:56,792 --> 01:58:57,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1739
01:58:57,632 --> 01:58:58,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I would.

1740
01:58:58,933 --> 01:58:59,273
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1741
01:58:59,774 --> 01:59:01,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with some more stories.

1742
01:59:01,094 --> 01:59:03,176
[SPEAKER_08]: The Skype line coming up soon, but first, more news.

1743
01:59:03,256 --> 01:59:03,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1744
01:59:03,696 --> 01:59:06,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Studio, sex dungeon, same difference.

1745
01:59:07,719 --> 01:59:14,463
[SPEAKER_06]: So, apparently, you know, we were talking a little bit about online passes and stuff, and one of the things that the online passes,

1746
01:59:15,484 --> 01:59:17,185
[SPEAKER_06]: if you want to call them that.

1747
01:59:17,545 --> 01:59:23,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew is basically to deter used game sales.

1748
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:31,815
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a report that's out that's saying that basically used and digital sales actually make up about 35% of total console spending.

1749
01:59:32,135 --> 01:59:45,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's very, you know, it makes sense with a lot of the stuff nowadays available on the Xbox 360 Marketplace or the PlayStation Network or even the WiiWare stores and Steam and whatever.

1750
01:59:46,005 --> 01:59:48,688
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not surprising that it would be about that much.

1751
01:59:49,409 --> 01:59:56,778
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also saying that 23% of the console games purchased in the U.S.

1752
01:59:57,379 --> 02:00:02,185
[SPEAKER_06]: are used, and slightly more than the European market where it's about 20%.

1753
02:00:03,767 --> 02:00:24,916
[SPEAKER_06]: also digitally distributed titles rank lower in both regions I guess taking up 12% of console market in America and 9% in Europe and also I guess they're saying that the 12% that actually is approximately $960 million worth of content that's being purchased right there

1754
02:00:27,078 --> 02:00:33,744
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're saying also 54% of American console owners are spending an average of $49 a year on console downloads.

1755
02:00:38,007 --> 02:00:44,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, talking a little bit about PC, and you would kind of think that PC is going to be skewing more towards the digital side.

1756
02:00:45,451 --> 02:00:46,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that is true.

1757
02:00:46,512 --> 02:00:52,215
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying that 58% of all PC gaming dollars are spent digitally on games or DLC.

1758
02:00:53,295 --> 02:00:54,876
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the way it's going in the PC market.

1759
02:00:55,237 --> 02:00:57,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Not so much in the console market.

1760
02:00:57,378 --> 02:01:01,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not surprised because you see PC retail shelves really drying up.

1761
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:02,321
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a surprise at all.

1762
02:01:02,921 --> 02:01:04,262
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1763
02:01:29,753 --> 02:01:34,014
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually going to talk to people I know to take it apart and see about fixing the DVD player.

1764
02:01:34,294 --> 02:01:35,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

1765
02:01:35,475 --> 02:01:38,095
[SPEAKER_15]: And seeing what I can do to get Linux on it.

1766
02:01:38,115 --> 02:01:39,636
[SPEAKER_15]: To make it do your evil bidding?

1767
02:01:39,936 --> 02:01:48,058
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a version of Linux that's meant to run on a Mac and mirror Mac OS, only use a lot less memory and be a lot more efficient.

1768
02:01:48,178 --> 02:01:49,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Then she's going to install the grid on it.

1769
02:01:50,518 --> 02:01:50,838
[SPEAKER_08]: End of line.

1770
02:01:50,858 --> 02:01:51,899
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'll move in.

1771
02:01:52,759 --> 02:01:53,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1772
02:01:56,237 --> 02:02:22,904
[SPEAKER_06]: but anyhow only 35% you would think with all these online passes and everything it was much higher it doesn't seem so bad no because I think the majority of you know because you're looking at dollars and the majority of the stuff that's purchased online would be cheaper and also a lot more people are you know lining up to go to the stores to buy stuff and also not a lot of stuff is like day and date with you know games on you don't have it yet where you can buy

1773
02:02:23,784 --> 02:02:32,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty at midnight as a digital download and I would be willing to bet if they did that you'd probably see a lot of people going that route.

1774
02:02:32,610 --> 02:02:40,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Steam did launch Skyrim where you could preload the game and then you unencrypt it at midnight.

1775
02:02:40,715 --> 02:02:43,477
[SPEAKER_08]: They did do that for Skyrim and I think they've done it for other big games too.

1776
02:02:43,637 --> 02:02:49,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Steam does that a lot but I'm saying as far as console stuff goes you don't see that.

1777
02:02:51,690 --> 02:02:53,213
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, you don't see consoles yet.

1778
02:02:54,134 --> 02:02:55,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet.

1779
02:02:55,616 --> 02:03:05,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait for the Xbox Lube, because it's going to give the Lube, it's going to Lube up GameStop, because I bet a lot of these new consoles are going to go very, very heavy on digital distribution.

1780
02:03:07,233 --> 02:03:08,173
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop can bend over.

1781
02:03:08,814 --> 02:03:09,074
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1782
02:03:10,515 --> 02:03:11,055
[SPEAKER_08]: What, you all right?

1783
02:03:12,015 --> 02:03:12,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

1784
02:03:12,295 --> 02:03:13,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just listening to what Dan's playing.

1785
02:03:14,116 --> 02:03:14,376
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1786
02:03:14,516 --> 02:03:15,117
[SPEAKER_08]: What is he playing?

1787
02:03:15,597 --> 02:03:16,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row III.

1788
02:03:16,517 --> 02:03:16,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nice.

1789
02:03:17,318 --> 02:03:17,558
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1790
02:03:18,898 --> 02:03:19,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

1791
02:03:20,419 --> 02:03:24,121
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the biggest complaints about the Wii U when it was announced to E3 this year is what?

1792
02:03:24,781 --> 02:03:32,745
[SPEAKER_08]: All the games will only work with the one controller, because I guess the system was not capable when they showed it at E3 of running games on multiple controllers.

1793
02:03:32,765 --> 02:03:40,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know the touchscreens, the device is basically processing the screen and what you're seeing on the TV.

1794
02:03:40,449 --> 02:03:43,890
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it was worrisome that you wouldn't be able to run multiple controllers.

1795
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:44,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, however...

1796
02:03:45,311 --> 02:03:55,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, some stuff is going on behind the scenes where they might actually be retooling the Wii U to work with multiple of those consoles.

1797
02:03:56,283 --> 02:04:06,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess there's an article on developonline.net that talks about Nintendo now knows they absolutely need to support two tablets.

1798
02:04:07,134 --> 02:04:12,857
[SPEAKER_08]: At E3, they didn't commit to this, but they know how important it is to make technically feasible to support two screens.

1799
02:04:13,357 --> 02:04:16,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if that affects frame rate, as a developer and player, I don't care.

1800
02:04:16,699 --> 02:04:17,420
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to work.

1801
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:20,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Developers will design appropriate games for this.

1802
02:04:20,501 --> 02:04:23,923
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're building a quiz game, you're not going to give a shit about the frame rate.

1803
02:04:24,684 --> 02:04:30,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, so apparently Nintendo is being pressured by developers to get this to work.

1804
02:04:31,867 --> 02:04:33,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Could it end up delaying the whole system?

1805
02:04:34,269 --> 02:04:34,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

1806
02:04:35,498 --> 02:04:37,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you've already speculated the Wii U is not coming out next year.

1807
02:04:38,779 --> 02:04:39,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't be surprised.

1808
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:41,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't be surprised if it's 2013.

1809
02:04:42,981 --> 02:04:47,222
[SPEAKER_08]: How is Nintendo going to... I mean, I was going to say, how is Nintendo going to recover next year?

1810
02:04:47,382 --> 02:04:53,044
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're hearing reports that 3DS sales are going way up because of Mario 3D Land, at least over in Japan.

1811
02:04:53,304 --> 02:04:54,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it'll help.

1812
02:04:55,125 --> 02:04:59,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And definitely what they're going to have next year will help.

1813
02:04:59,687 --> 02:04:59,847
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

1814
02:05:02,890 --> 02:05:07,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, that new system just sounds so broken right now.

1815
02:05:07,936 --> 02:05:10,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have nothing to show for it yet.

1816
02:05:10,839 --> 02:05:13,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some tech demos that are basically Wii games.

1817
02:05:13,943 --> 02:05:15,104
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been six months.

1818
02:05:15,364 --> 02:05:17,326
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably a lot further along than what we saw at E3.

1819
02:05:17,346 --> 02:05:18,808
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a lot, lot

1820
02:05:18,928 --> 02:05:20,829
[SPEAKER_08]: further, further along next E3.

1821
02:05:21,090 --> 02:05:23,632
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think it's a done deal yet.

1822
02:05:23,732 --> 02:05:28,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Nintendo knows that people were not as thrilled with Wii U as they were with the 3DS.

1823
02:05:28,996 --> 02:05:33,119
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think come next E3, they're really prepared to just blow us away.

1824
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:45,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think some hardcore developers getting up on that stage, some third-party developers gonna get up there and show, you know, Saints Row 4 or something on the Wii U and how it's, you know, the technology is amazing or whatever.

1825
02:05:46,268 --> 02:05:48,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously I'm just picking that because I know it'll

1826
02:05:50,476 --> 02:05:51,436
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll get you interested.

1827
02:05:51,856 --> 02:05:52,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1828
02:05:53,057 --> 02:05:53,277
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1829
02:05:53,797 --> 02:05:53,977
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

1830
02:05:54,658 --> 02:05:56,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you no way know-how buying a Wii U?

1831
02:05:57,039 --> 02:06:00,841
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I wouldn't say that, but I'm just saying I'm not... He's gonna steal one.

1832
02:06:01,961 --> 02:06:02,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Steal one, please.

1833
02:06:03,222 --> 02:06:07,504
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not gonna... It's not something that right now I need to have.

1834
02:06:08,764 --> 02:06:12,766
[SPEAKER_08]: GameGuru in our chatroom says, Yeah, the GameCube could support four GBAs.

1835
02:06:13,187 --> 02:06:13,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Mmm...

1836
02:06:14,167 --> 02:06:14,487
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

1837
02:06:30,787 --> 02:06:34,068
[SPEAKER_08]: The box is streaming the image to your tablet.

1838
02:06:34,168 --> 02:06:40,891
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have some processing power to those tablets, but they can't put a lot of processing power in there because they've got to keep the price down.

1839
02:06:41,871 --> 02:06:49,514
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe that's something they might have to put more oomph in those tablets and make them more expensive.

1840
02:06:49,634 --> 02:06:52,956
[SPEAKER_06]: What they should have done is they should delay this shit for another few years.

1841
02:06:53,036 --> 02:06:55,917
[SPEAKER_06]: When the price of those components comes down, then you can do that.

1842
02:06:56,477 --> 02:06:59,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but those tablets are essentially the lower half of a DS.

1843
02:07:00,382 --> 02:07:01,703
[SPEAKER_08]: How expensive can those be now?

1844
02:07:02,044 --> 02:07:03,225
[SPEAKER_08]: DSs are $79.

1845
02:07:05,307 --> 02:07:07,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like the lowest-end DS is $79.

1846
02:07:08,131 --> 02:07:10,053
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't tell me that technology is that expensive.

1847
02:07:10,313 --> 02:07:12,035
[SPEAKER_08]: We're already expecting those tablets are going to be $100 a pop.

1848
02:07:16,022 --> 02:07:37,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know so all I know is I think it's a big old gimmick and I'm still not buying into it yet it's a fucking Wii with slightly better graphics and a goddamn tablet that's what's that tablet gonna do for me oh it's gonna stream some shit on it okay great you know this is shit that could have been on the screen oh but we're moving the inventory okay I why should I spend $100 on a tablet

1849
02:07:39,569 --> 02:07:50,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, to be neat, you're going to put the inventory screen on this tablet instead of having push start to pop the inventory screen up.

1850
02:07:50,637 --> 02:07:51,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, who gives a shit?

1851
02:07:51,738 --> 02:08:03,147
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to make our frame rate and stuff drop because we really need this inventory screen to not be... Once again, and this also goes to the Kinect too...

1852
02:08:04,787 --> 02:08:06,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't I just do things the old way?

1853
02:08:06,709 --> 02:08:09,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't I just push a button, inventory screen pops up?

1854
02:08:09,911 --> 02:08:13,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do I need the map always on the bottom of the screen?

1855
02:08:13,154 --> 02:08:16,177
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want the map on the bottom of the screen, put it in the corner of the screen and be done with it.

1856
02:08:16,557 --> 02:08:18,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do I need the shout grenade to throw a grenade?

1857
02:08:18,939 --> 02:08:19,559
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to.

1858
02:08:19,740 --> 02:08:25,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I don't have to, but that's the thing though, is in these games, why do I have to waggle my controller to throw a grenade?

1859
02:08:25,865 --> 02:08:26,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't I just push a button?

1860
02:08:27,106 --> 02:08:27,786
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stupid.

1861
02:08:28,627 --> 02:08:46,342
[SPEAKER_08]: just because you can doesn't mean you should all they have to do is get up on that stage and say brand new F-Zero game coming to Wii U and I pre-ordered that's all they would have to do and you're part of the problem I am absolutely part of the problem but it's F-Zero, Loki it's the best GameCube game they had rah

1862
02:08:46,974 --> 02:08:48,875
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to understand, Rob, those times are gone.

1863
02:08:49,776 --> 02:08:52,818
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't give a shit about F-Zero anymore, and if they do, it's gonna suck.

1864
02:08:52,838 --> 02:08:54,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you so mean, Loki?

1865
02:08:55,559 --> 02:08:59,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Next thing you're gonna tell me the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus aren't real.

1866
02:09:00,002 --> 02:09:00,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Rob?

1867
02:09:00,943 --> 02:09:01,183
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1868
02:09:01,463 --> 02:09:01,783
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not.

1869
02:09:04,778 --> 02:09:05,138
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1870
02:09:25,133 --> 02:09:32,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the virtual console release of Super Street Fighter 2 on Genesis in Japan has Wi-Fi.

1871
02:09:33,517 --> 02:09:34,358
[SPEAKER_15]: So did Puyo Puyo.

1872
02:09:35,298 --> 02:09:42,221
[SPEAKER_15]: But while we're getting the game, Street Fighter is not... No, yeah, it is.

1873
02:09:42,341 --> 02:09:45,843
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually going to have the Wi-Fi capability.

1874
02:09:45,863 --> 02:09:47,164
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's kind of cool.

1875
02:09:48,324 --> 02:09:49,084
[SPEAKER_15]: But why not Puyo Puyo?

1876
02:09:50,526 --> 02:09:51,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not other stuff?

1877
02:09:52,266 --> 02:09:54,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, unfortunately, Street Fighter is Street Fighter.

1878
02:09:54,427 --> 02:09:59,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, not unfortunately, but Street Fighter is Street Fighter, and everybody likes Street Fighter.

1879
02:09:59,568 --> 02:10:01,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Only some people have even heard of Puyo Puyo.

1880
02:10:01,629 --> 02:10:03,209
[SPEAKER_08]: But Street Fighter 2 is huge.

1881
02:10:03,769 --> 02:10:05,710
[SPEAKER_15]: We should be able to play people anywhere.

1882
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:13,312
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, yay for Virtual Console finally getting some online play capability about five years too late.

1883
02:10:14,651 --> 02:10:16,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, did you hear about how they're doing this?

1884
02:10:16,293 --> 02:10:20,217
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing it through emulation of that... Oh, God, I forgot the name of it.

1885
02:10:20,257 --> 02:10:21,258
[SPEAKER_08]: The X-Mode?

1886
02:10:22,039 --> 02:10:23,121
[SPEAKER_08]: What the fuck was that thing?

1887
02:10:23,181 --> 02:10:24,602
[SPEAKER_08]: The X... No.

1888
02:10:25,243 --> 02:10:25,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I forget.

1889
02:10:26,184 --> 02:10:27,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody in chat will yell it out.

1890
02:10:27,265 --> 02:10:28,947
[SPEAKER_15]: That online Genesis thing, right?

1891
02:10:29,027 --> 02:10:30,309
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not the Sega channel.

1892
02:10:30,889 --> 02:10:34,333
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was Genesis and it was Super Nintendo.

1893
02:10:34,974 --> 02:10:35,274
[SPEAKER_08]: An X...

1894
02:10:36,695 --> 02:10:36,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh!

1895
02:10:37,356 --> 02:10:44,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could plug it in, and it sat between your cartridge and the console, and you could dial into this network and play people.

1896
02:10:44,181 --> 02:10:46,383
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like an old, old, old-ass version of Xbox Live.

1897
02:10:46,403 --> 02:10:47,724
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what you're talking about.

1898
02:10:47,804 --> 02:10:48,724
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that's the name of it.

1899
02:10:49,225 --> 02:10:50,025
[SPEAKER_08]: That's stupid.

1900
02:10:50,225 --> 02:10:51,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody in Chow shot it.

1901
02:10:51,707 --> 02:10:53,068
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to do any work.

1902
02:10:53,088 --> 02:10:54,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just emulate this old shit.

1903
02:10:54,589 --> 02:10:56,070
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they're doing to make it work.

1904
02:10:56,410 --> 02:10:57,311
[SPEAKER_15]: It's too stupid.

1905
02:10:59,012 --> 02:11:00,513
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to build an emulator.

1906
02:11:01,094 --> 02:11:02,775
[SPEAKER_15]: If they can do it in Japan, why can't they do it here?

1907
02:11:04,526 --> 02:11:26,840
[SPEAKER_08]: that's what they're doing in Japan is they're using that emulation to do it of course I'm believing everything I read on the internet so it might not actually be true but it wouldn't surprise me at all so just silly yeah X-Band thank you chatters who said that first X-Band Orange Wright said it first

1908
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:31,641
[SPEAKER_08]: have you ever seen the X-Band?

1909
02:11:33,023 --> 02:11:42,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I think only like 7,000 of them were ever sold here's a picture of it oh that's a tiny picture but that's all I got but you can kind of see how it like sits between the cartridge and the console plug it in

1910
02:11:44,409 --> 02:11:45,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Expand, thank you.

1911
02:11:46,270 --> 02:11:47,610
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki, what do you got for us?

1912
02:11:48,290 --> 02:11:50,851
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's talk about Modern Warfare.

1913
02:11:51,071 --> 02:11:52,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, we're saving the best for last, right?

1914
02:11:53,692 --> 02:11:58,813
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Modern Warfare 3, of course, not surprisingly, broke all sorts of records.

1915
02:11:59,473 --> 02:12:07,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It had the biggest launch ever for a game, and it sold 6.5 million units in one day.

1916
02:12:08,536 --> 02:12:11,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's both in our total from US and UK.

1917
02:12:11,517 --> 02:12:11,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1918
02:12:13,938 --> 02:12:21,353
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course they're saying that they were estimating 9 million units but

1919
02:12:23,174 --> 02:12:24,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say give it a couple weeks.

1920
02:12:26,455 --> 02:12:30,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, that puts the revenue for that game so far at $400 million.

1921
02:12:31,176 --> 02:12:40,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And the previous record, of course, was $310 million last year with Black Ops.

1922
02:12:40,918 --> 02:12:45,500
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, or I'm sorry, with Modern Warfare 2 it was $310 million, Black Ops was $360 million.

1923
02:12:47,597 --> 02:13:11,128
[SPEAKER_06]: so next year with whatever the fuck they come out with it'll be higher than that because people buy into this crap and not to say it's a bad game but it's a lot of people buying that game what draws everybody to this series popularity I think it's mob mentality friends

1924
02:13:13,015 --> 02:13:14,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what draws people to World of Warcraft.

1925
02:13:14,536 --> 02:13:15,156
[SPEAKER_08]: They are pretty.

1926
02:13:15,356 --> 02:13:16,236
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen them.

1927
02:13:16,296 --> 02:13:17,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Friends, you're right.

1928
02:13:17,076 --> 02:13:18,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Social aspect, absolutely.

1929
02:13:18,537 --> 02:13:20,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And definitely that's something they built up this time.

1930
02:13:21,178 --> 02:13:22,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's true.

1931
02:13:23,699 --> 02:13:25,119
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, last story for you guys.

1932
02:13:25,179 --> 02:13:26,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know what draws people to it.

1933
02:13:26,580 --> 02:13:30,181
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because of the fact that little kids get to play this game because their parents suck.

1934
02:13:31,421 --> 02:13:32,142
[SPEAKER_06]: They let them go out.

1935
02:13:32,222 --> 02:13:33,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's it.

1936
02:13:33,462 --> 02:13:33,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

1937
02:13:33,842 --> 02:13:35,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would... How many...

1938
02:13:36,563 --> 02:13:42,987
[SPEAKER_06]: How much do you want to bet that about 1 million of that 3.6 million sold is probably people under the age of 13?

1939
02:13:44,688 --> 02:13:46,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about 13.

1940
02:13:46,129 --> 02:13:48,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Under the age of 18, maybe.

1941
02:13:49,631 --> 02:13:50,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely under the age of 18.

1942
02:13:50,651 --> 02:13:52,493
[SPEAKER_06]: 17-year-olds and 16-year-olds, I believe it.

1943
02:13:52,613 --> 02:13:54,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the age of 15.

1944
02:13:55,354 --> 02:13:56,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I guarantee it.

1945
02:13:57,015 --> 02:13:58,276
[SPEAKER_08]: 1 million at least.

1946
02:13:59,537 --> 02:13:59,817
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1947
02:14:00,464 --> 02:14:01,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to one more story.

1948
02:14:01,846 --> 02:14:03,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we're going to get to Twitter topics.

1949
02:14:03,768 --> 02:14:07,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1950
02:14:07,693 --> 02:14:09,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is about another series that's being worked on.

1951
02:14:10,096 --> 02:14:16,164
[SPEAKER_08]: This is kind of a duh, but it's probably nice to hear that Gran Turismo 6, yep, it's underway.

1952
02:14:16,224 --> 02:14:16,985
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being developed.

1953
02:14:17,005 --> 02:14:17,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it is!

1954
02:14:18,046 --> 02:14:19,547
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come out for another eight years.

1955
02:14:20,228 --> 02:14:22,930
[SPEAKER_08]: But isn't it nice to know that it's being worked on?

1956
02:14:23,311 --> 02:14:28,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess this is coming from Kazunori Yamauchi, who's the creator of the Gran Turismo franchise.

1957
02:14:28,615 --> 02:14:30,777
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the president of Polyphony Digital.

1958
02:14:31,238 --> 02:14:37,003
[SPEAKER_08]: And he actually, I guess, was at the Specialty Equipment Market Association Industry Trade Show in Las Vegas.

1959
02:14:37,023 --> 02:14:38,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Because where else do trade shows happen?

1960
02:14:38,985 --> 02:14:41,987
[SPEAKER_08]: And was talking a lot about some of the recent developments to Gran Turismo 5.

1961
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:43,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1962
02:15:11,502 --> 02:15:12,402
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1963
02:15:34,947 --> 02:15:40,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row the Thirds dominate a lot of conversation tonight or maybe have something else that you think needs a shout out.

1964
02:15:40,552 --> 02:15:43,415
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the US and Canada.

1965
02:15:44,035 --> 02:15:45,897
[SPEAKER_08]: For everybody else, you probably want to use Skype.

1966
02:15:46,077 --> 02:15:48,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1967
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:50,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Skype us, baby, Skype us.

1968
02:15:51,062 --> 02:15:53,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, just tell us, oh, it's so much fun.

1969
02:15:54,865 --> 02:15:57,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR, getting to some tweets tonight.

1970
02:15:57,948 --> 02:15:59,690
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start off with a tweet from Redertainment.

1971
02:16:00,612 --> 02:16:27,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Considering all the AAA games coming out in the next couple of weeks I'm wondering if there's a bank with good rates on credit cards No, there is not The answer to your question is no I guess my real answer, even though I get the tongue-in-cheekness of your question The real answer would be it depends on your credit score The all-important credit score is what's going to determine who's going to give you good rates Because if your credit score is really bad Then the only way you're going to get a credit card is what's called a secured credit card

1972
02:16:27,908 --> 02:16:29,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, this is X-Link What's on your mind, buddy?

1973
02:16:53,629 --> 02:16:56,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I just wanted to say Modern Warfare 3 was pretty decent.

1974
02:16:56,815 --> 02:17:01,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'm not really all into first-person shooters, but I actually loved playing it.

1975
02:17:01,364 --> 02:17:04,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I was playing with a roommate of mine, and we loved playing the co-op.

1976
02:17:04,871 --> 02:17:05,632
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a lot of fun.

1977
02:17:06,161 --> 02:17:06,982
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you do in the game?

1978
02:17:07,022 --> 02:17:10,145
[SPEAKER_08]: You just go through and shoot terrorists in the face?

1979
02:17:10,185 --> 02:17:17,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, there's a co-op called, it's like a mission type mode where they give you different little missions to go through.

1980
02:17:17,491 --> 02:17:27,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the favorite ones we were doing was, I can't think of the name of it right off the bat, I think it's like the fifth or sixth one down, like in the third or fourth mission, like the second tier set of missions.

1981
02:17:28,241 --> 02:17:30,463
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically because

1982
02:17:31,975 --> 02:17:34,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I was the second player and my roommate was the first.

1983
02:17:35,337 --> 02:17:45,044
[SPEAKER_09]: If he was the first player, you would actually try to get him off the base, but you're controlling the torrents that we're hacking into.

1984
02:17:45,685 --> 02:17:47,966
[SPEAKER_09]: So one person will play at the hacked torrent.

1985
02:17:48,147 --> 02:17:54,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, you can sit there and mow down all the enemies as you're trying to get him to run through to the other side of the base.

1986
02:17:54,151 --> 02:17:54,671
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty decent.

1987
02:17:55,914 --> 02:18:01,298
[SPEAKER_08]: X-Link, I'm actually really interested to hear that you're into this game because I know you and I usually play a lot of the same types of games.

1988
02:18:01,378 --> 02:18:04,461
[SPEAKER_08]: We both play WoW an awful lot, in fact, way more than we probably should.

1989
02:18:04,841 --> 02:18:11,586
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we play a lot of the same type of puzzly games on Steam and so forth, but, you know, you are actually kind of jumping into Modern Warfare.

1990
02:18:11,686 --> 02:18:17,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I, for one, am terrible at first-person shooters, so how hard is a game like Modern Warfare for someone like me?

1991
02:18:18,792 --> 02:18:18,932
[SPEAKER_09]: It's

1992
02:18:19,898 --> 02:18:22,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally, I suck at first-person shooters myself.

1993
02:18:22,659 --> 02:18:27,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm usually the one who's running into a room full of 15 enemies to try to mow them all down one time.

1994
02:18:27,301 --> 02:18:30,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm basically the copycat of the noob from the commercial, basically.

1995
02:18:31,063 --> 02:18:33,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just, like, boring around, doing anything I pretty much could see.

1996
02:18:33,904 --> 02:18:36,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really take my time, and I hide behind walls and stuff.

1997
02:18:39,268 --> 02:18:43,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'm really bad at that because I'm so used to, I guess, Grand Theft Auto.

1998
02:18:43,651 --> 02:18:44,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Quake.

1999
02:18:44,772 --> 02:18:47,854
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you play Quake.

2000
02:18:47,894 --> 02:18:52,618
[SPEAKER_08]: That will always be my favorite first-person shooter is Quake because there was no such thing as cover.

2001
02:18:53,039 --> 02:19:04,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Then again, like I said before, I take you back to the Quake and stuff like that and back to my days like being a rogue and just going around and pretty much popping up behind people and killing them.

2002
02:19:04,788 --> 02:19:06,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

2003
02:19:06,775 --> 02:19:09,697
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I liked it personally.

2004
02:19:09,837 --> 02:19:10,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was a lot of fun.

2005
02:19:10,737 --> 02:19:12,738
[SPEAKER_09]: The graphics were very, very cool to look at.

2006
02:19:12,779 --> 02:19:13,899
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very updated.

2007
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:20,363
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing that I got a problem with any of these games now, it's like, they're always talking about making the next one.

2008
02:19:20,423 --> 02:19:22,484
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, how did they ever one-up what they did?

2009
02:19:22,524 --> 02:19:35,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, seriously, like, I remember playing games and, like, getting used to, like, more, like, say, for example, Mario, like, going from Mario World to, like, Mario 64 and seeing the graphics change and ever, and seeing this process of evolution constantly going through.

2010
02:19:35,632 --> 02:19:35,932
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like,

2011
02:19:36,721 --> 02:19:44,829
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going to be, like, how far is it going to be from now on before they hit that brick wall, so to speak, before they can't go any further than they do?

2012
02:20:01,264 --> 02:20:02,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Get ready for it.

2013
02:20:02,064 --> 02:20:03,205
[SPEAKER_08]: You already have holograms.

2014
02:20:03,485 --> 02:20:05,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, if I can get in the holodeck in my wheelchair, I'm there.

2015
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:22,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week I called it the Bobby show and I was talking about Skyrim.

2016
02:20:22,441 --> 02:20:30,423
[SPEAKER_09]: And I fortunately, because of the situation which you and Jamie are familiar with, with my roommate, and I'm going to get all that on the show.

2017
02:20:30,523 --> 02:20:31,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Personal drama.

2018
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:33,604
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just say personal drama.

2019
02:20:35,325 --> 02:20:39,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, long story short, I got fucked over $1,500 from my ex-roommate.

2020
02:20:39,766 --> 02:20:40,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Bottom line.

2021
02:20:40,727 --> 02:20:43,387
[SPEAKER_09]: And that caused a lot of problems from the beginning to the end.

2022
02:20:43,467 --> 02:20:45,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, I was really looking forward to Skyrim.

2023
02:20:45,668 --> 02:20:46,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I had it pre-ordered.

2024
02:20:46,648 --> 02:20:48,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a lot of money down on it.

2025
02:20:49,264 --> 02:20:52,227
[SPEAKER_09]: and, unfortunately, I had to cancel it last minute because of other priorities.

2026
02:20:52,468 --> 02:20:57,293
[SPEAKER_09]: So, because of that, instead, I went to Redbox, tried to run what I could.

2027
02:20:57,373 --> 02:20:59,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, I still wanted to play something a little more new.

2028
02:20:59,615 --> 02:21:01,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, Skyrim.

2029
02:21:01,678 --> 02:21:02,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot.

2030
02:21:02,298 --> 02:21:02,999
[SPEAKER_09]: I was being stupid.

2031
02:21:03,039 --> 02:21:03,820
[SPEAKER_09]: I go there on a Thursday.

2032
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:05,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, okay, I'm going to go get Skyrim.

2033
02:21:05,642 --> 02:21:07,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Not thinking that it came out the following day.

2034
02:21:08,705 --> 02:21:09,266
[SPEAKER_09]: And, because it's

2035
02:21:10,293 --> 02:21:38,645
[SPEAKER_09]: because of it I decided to get Modern Warfare 3 because Modern Warfare 3 was the closest one around the corner so I got that instead which was a little disappointing by any means because I was very blown away by it well you'll get to play Skyrim eventually and you know personal life stuff's more important and you know unfortunately that whole situation's kind of crappy but you'll get through it so yeah I will and you know I'm very patient I was the same way with Fallout and though I really was kind of pissed at um

2036
02:21:39,948 --> 02:21:42,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for calling in and telling us about Modern Warfare.

2037
02:21:42,129 --> 02:21:42,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

2038
02:22:07,136 --> 02:22:10,425
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio

2039
02:22:12,483 --> 02:22:14,524
[SPEAKER_08]: He made Modern Warfare sound.

2040
02:22:14,684 --> 02:22:15,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, it's pretty.

2041
02:22:16,364 --> 02:22:20,185
[SPEAKER_08]: You're oogling the prettiness, and then you shoot bad guys in the face.

2042
02:22:21,185 --> 02:22:26,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to more tweets, twitter.com slash orange lounge, or excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR.

2043
02:22:27,867 --> 02:22:29,567
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a couple links from Tigerclaw.

2044
02:22:30,067 --> 02:22:31,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, the trailer.

2045
02:22:31,067 --> 02:22:34,368
[SPEAKER_08]: He linked us to the trailer for the Phoenix Wright live action movie.

2046
02:22:34,408 --> 02:22:35,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys see this?

2047
02:22:35,648 --> 02:22:37,849
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually a trailer out there on the interwebs.

2048
02:22:38,810 --> 02:22:40,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I saw some of this.

2049
02:22:44,827 --> 02:22:45,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I will totally watch this.

2050
02:22:46,008 --> 02:22:48,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've even got the guy's hairs all right.

2051
02:22:51,390 --> 02:22:57,312
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite is... It's totally accurate.

2052
02:22:59,413 --> 02:23:01,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that they have the style from the games.

2053
02:23:04,595 --> 02:23:05,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I will totally watch it.

2054
02:23:05,695 --> 02:23:07,296
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be like 20 kinds of awesome.

2055
02:23:07,376 --> 02:23:10,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, she's even wearing the thingy.

2056
02:23:11,670 --> 02:23:16,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's your one and only local convention whore, DJ Ranma S

2057
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:32,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, friends out there and a girlfriend.

2058
02:23:32,101 --> 02:23:32,701
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I say?

2059
02:23:33,161 --> 02:23:34,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

2060
02:23:34,082 --> 02:23:34,782
[SPEAKER_08]: You did it for pussy.

2061
02:23:34,842 --> 02:23:35,222
[SPEAKER_08]: It's alright.

2062
02:23:35,862 --> 02:23:36,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2063
02:23:38,303 --> 02:23:39,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, let me ask you something.

2064
02:23:39,883 --> 02:23:41,343
[SPEAKER_05]: What have you done for ass?

2065
02:23:41,464 --> 02:23:41,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

2066
02:23:41,764 --> 02:23:43,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

2067
02:23:48,163 --> 02:23:48,683
[SPEAKER_08]: No comment.

2068
02:23:48,784 --> 02:23:49,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2069
02:23:49,084 --> 02:23:50,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright then.

2070
02:23:51,266 --> 02:23:53,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just as bad as a whore as me, okay?

2071
02:23:53,447 --> 02:23:53,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, wait.

2072
02:23:53,828 --> 02:23:55,028
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

2073
02:23:55,349 --> 02:23:56,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm settled down now.

2074
02:23:56,730 --> 02:23:58,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Those days are long behind me.

2075
02:23:58,711 --> 02:23:59,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Same here.

2076
02:23:59,952 --> 02:24:00,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2077
02:24:00,513 --> 02:24:02,494
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyhow, how was the con that you went to?

2078
02:24:03,855 --> 02:24:04,536
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

2079
02:24:04,636 --> 02:24:08,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the best part is you look across the waterfront, you see Canada.

2080
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:10,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

2081
02:24:12,022 --> 02:24:14,003
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, oh, better places.

2082
02:24:14,184 --> 02:24:14,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2083
02:24:15,444 --> 02:24:16,065
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

2084
02:24:31,061 --> 02:24:35,542
[SPEAKER_05]: If that was me, my mother would have tanned my high and I'd be hanging from a tree right now.

2085
02:24:35,903 --> 02:24:38,263
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's different from when you and I were growing up.

2086
02:24:39,164 --> 02:24:40,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma, the same way.

2087
02:24:41,164 --> 02:24:43,725
[SPEAKER_08]: My mother, oh my god, she would have lost her shit.

2088
02:24:43,985 --> 02:24:44,965
[SPEAKER_08]: She would have lost her shit.

2089
02:24:45,085 --> 02:24:53,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, she had such fear instilled in me that she had me convinced that there were like rabid dogs waiting outside to chew my face off if I ever tried to sneak out of the house.

2090
02:24:53,708 --> 02:24:56,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, she slept with one eye open.

2091
02:24:56,789 --> 02:24:57,189
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

2092
02:24:57,769 --> 02:24:59,730
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the same token though, I mean...

2093
02:25:00,765 --> 02:25:28,179
[SPEAKER_05]: being in the schools for about a year I don't really see these 12 and 13 year olds being at a GameStop or at a Best Buy at midnight by themselves if they're with friends picking up the game that's believable but by yourself on a bike I don't see that I'm going to go ask Dan how many 13 year olds showed up at his midnight releases I'll be right back DarkSakura's for an M rated game what was the other thing you wanted to mention

2094
02:25:29,162 --> 02:25:33,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to pick at Loki for a comment he said last week.

2095
02:25:34,084 --> 02:25:34,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2096
02:25:34,744 --> 02:25:37,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki has to pay for something he said last week.

2097
02:25:37,105 --> 02:25:37,525
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

2098
02:25:38,646 --> 02:25:40,046
[SPEAKER_05]: His comment about Skylanders.

2099
02:25:40,586 --> 02:25:40,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2100
02:25:41,807 --> 02:25:50,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I understand where he's coming from about how silly the game is and how kids want their parents to get that game.

2101
02:25:50,570 --> 02:25:54,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Without divulging too much information, I understand where he's coming from with that.

2102
02:25:54,772 --> 02:25:55,552
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the same token...

2103
02:25:56,940 --> 02:25:57,401
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2104
02:26:18,789 --> 02:26:19,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

2105
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:20,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

2106
02:26:20,791 --> 02:26:21,751
[SPEAKER_08]: With their parents or no?

2107
02:26:22,712 --> 02:26:24,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we find that out?

2108
02:26:24,954 --> 02:26:28,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, I won't be doing that for my son because I'm not going to buy him stupid shit like that.

2109
02:26:30,318 --> 02:26:32,180
[SPEAKER_08]: All the games have to pass the dad test.

2110
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:35,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, he won't be playing crappy games like Skylanders, please.

2111
02:26:37,254 --> 02:26:37,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no problem...

2112
02:27:04,429 --> 02:27:09,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem if he wants to play, you know, like a Connectimals or something like that.

2113
02:27:09,274 --> 02:27:12,997
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a regular game, may not be something that I'm necessarily looking for.

2114
02:27:14,479 --> 02:27:29,172
[SPEAKER_06]: But a game that promotes the whoring out of children to buy, you know, crappy toys, which, by the way, they keep putting out more toys because, you know, they're going to just add patches to the game so that more toys are compatible with it.

2115
02:27:30,073 --> 02:27:57,996
[SPEAKER_06]: and uh so yeah it's basically just getting kids to beg their parents to buy them toys and you know what parents are dumb enough to buy them their toys then Activision deserves the money that they're getting from them but I'm smart enough to go no it's a toy that doesn't do anything how about I buy you a cooler toy instead and he'll be like okay you know what my rule is no TV until you're five I'm serious I'm dead serious try having a kid that's not gonna happen laughing

2116
02:27:58,877 --> 02:28:02,242
[SPEAKER_15]: I know plenty of parents who have been completely successful with not having their kids.

2117
02:28:02,262 --> 02:28:04,345
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to run out of things to do with them.

2118
02:28:05,727 --> 02:28:06,408
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay.

2119
02:28:06,689 --> 02:28:10,895
[SPEAKER_15]: I would rather them not be psychologically dependent on TV.

2120
02:28:11,357 --> 02:28:13,698
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not dependent on it, but sometimes TV helps.

2121
02:28:13,818 --> 02:28:16,859
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't want to be... I don't care.

2122
02:28:16,979 --> 02:28:17,759
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't matter to me.

2123
02:28:17,819 --> 02:28:18,459
[SPEAKER_08]: None of that matters to me.

2124
02:28:18,479 --> 02:28:19,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get back to the caller.

2125
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:28,543
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Ranma, you're giving in to the Skylanders stuff for the sake of this kid who just wants it.

2126
02:28:28,563 --> 02:28:31,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Ranma, did you buy one of the Tony Hawk ride boards?

2127
02:28:31,224 --> 02:28:38,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was a cool little peripheral that they had for Tony Hawk, and you like supporting Activision, so did you buy one of those?

2128
02:28:38,346 --> 02:28:38,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2129
02:28:39,036 --> 02:28:39,596
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

2130
02:29:08,850 --> 02:29:13,851
[SPEAKER_05]: If he starts talking with that type of attitude, I will take my belt off right there in Toys R Us.

2131
02:29:14,151 --> 02:29:15,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and I will go to town on him.

2132
02:29:16,132 --> 02:29:17,332
[SPEAKER_05]: You best believe that.

2133
02:29:17,772 --> 02:29:23,993
[SPEAKER_06]: He can have the game when it gets into the bargain bin like March because that's pretty much when it's going to die out.

2134
02:29:25,914 --> 02:29:26,254
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2135
02:29:27,014 --> 02:29:31,395
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Ranma, I got to let you go to get more calls, but thank you for the lively discussion.

2136
02:29:32,495 --> 02:29:38,658
[SPEAKER_05]: and one thing, Loki, I want you to know I've taken notes on some of this so I know what to look forward to when my time comes.

2137
02:29:38,818 --> 02:29:40,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, he's taking notes!

2138
02:29:41,299 --> 02:29:43,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm shaking!

2139
02:29:43,579 --> 02:29:47,021
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean it in a good way, dude.

2140
02:29:47,181 --> 02:29:49,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he means for when he has his bebe.

2141
02:29:50,302 --> 02:29:50,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2142
02:29:51,863 --> 02:29:52,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, have a good one, Ranma.

2143
02:29:53,403 --> 02:29:53,744
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

2144
02:29:54,484 --> 02:29:54,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

2145
02:29:56,095 --> 02:29:57,877
[SPEAKER_08]: See, Loki took that to mean, like, taking notes.

2146
02:29:57,897 --> 02:29:59,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm writing down everything you say.

2147
02:30:15,857 --> 02:30:17,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

2148
02:30:38,451 --> 02:30:39,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2149
02:30:58,596 --> 02:30:59,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the rest of a comment.

2150
02:30:59,656 --> 02:31:02,778
[SPEAKER_08]: A patch is just around the corner and we will continue to ban cheaters.

2151
02:31:03,178 --> 02:31:04,258
[SPEAKER_08]: We take it seriously.

2152
02:31:04,358 --> 02:31:06,079
[SPEAKER_08]: That is our attitude here at Battlefield.

2153
02:31:06,459 --> 02:31:11,200
[SPEAKER_08]: We have zero tolerance for cheating players and are banning more all of the time.

2154
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:12,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the phones.

2155
02:31:12,061 --> 02:31:13,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2156
02:31:13,101 --> 02:31:13,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2157
02:31:15,222 --> 02:31:18,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, this is Amiga777.

2158
02:31:18,243 --> 02:31:19,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Amiga777.

2159
02:31:19,904 --> 02:31:20,604
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2160
02:31:22,544 --> 02:31:26,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I know there's been a lot of talk lately about

2161
02:31:27,642 --> 02:31:44,714
[SPEAKER_10]: The PSN hacks, the X5 Live hacks, and all that type of stuff So I guess one other thing to add to that is I guess much recently some Facebook hackings Well, about today

2162
02:31:55,142 --> 02:31:59,327
[SPEAKER_10]: I found out about some thing that was going on.

2163
02:31:59,347 --> 02:32:03,873
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a link from someone in chat.

2164
02:32:05,315 --> 02:32:13,085
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess it was something about a gross video that nobody...

2165
02:32:14,722 --> 02:32:16,844
[SPEAKER_10]: has ever really gone past it for 15 seconds.

2166
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:37,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch this video, it's really gross.

2167
02:32:37,304 --> 02:32:39,145
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll usually be something like in the UK.

2168
02:32:39,225 --> 02:32:40,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I had one of those one time that clicked.

2169
02:32:40,885 --> 02:32:52,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, here's a video of something, blah, blah, blah, and you click on it, and then I realized immediately what it was, and I saw that it posted something to my board, so I blocked it, and then I deleted the post, and that was it.

2170
02:32:53,728 --> 02:32:55,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Not everybody's so fast on the figure.

2171
02:32:55,568 --> 02:33:01,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because if you post it to yours, and then a friend will see that, and they'll post it, and then so on and so forth.

2172
02:33:01,909 --> 02:33:03,170
[SPEAKER_08]: So what happened, Amiga?

2173
02:33:03,250 --> 02:33:04,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you accidentally fall for this?

2174
02:33:06,816 --> 02:33:08,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my question.

2175
02:33:09,157 --> 02:33:11,617
[SPEAKER_10]: What were they advertising in the video that made you want to click it?

2176
02:33:11,657 --> 02:33:14,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it like, see big boobies now, click on this link?

2177
02:33:30,475 --> 02:33:35,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said it was this really, like, nasty video that they were saying.

2178
02:33:35,857 --> 02:33:46,001
[SPEAKER_10]: It had, like, this image of the back of this person's neck with this really large, you know, nasty zit on the back or something like that.

2179
02:33:46,101 --> 02:33:48,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Gross!

2180
02:33:48,462 --> 02:33:49,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2181
02:33:49,702 --> 02:33:51,063
[SPEAKER_08]: You're into, like, gross stuff.

2182
02:33:51,083 --> 02:33:53,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine was a celebrity sex tape, so of course you clicked on that.

2183
02:33:53,544 --> 02:33:56,865
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just real curious about it, you know, just tried to check it out.

2184
02:33:57,745 --> 02:33:58,966
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know...

2185
02:34:00,412 --> 02:34:05,456
[SPEAKER_10]: and then it asked me to do this little survey thing and I was like, I don't want to do a survey.

2186
02:34:07,117 --> 02:34:08,578
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't sign up.

2187
02:34:09,059 --> 02:34:11,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see the gross things on people's necks.

2188
02:34:11,421 --> 02:34:12,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to see a survey.

2189
02:34:13,682 --> 02:34:14,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I want the boobies.

2190
02:34:14,623 --> 02:34:15,884
[SPEAKER_15]: I have Shermie.

2191
02:34:16,465 --> 02:34:18,887
[SPEAKER_15]: I already see gross shit, literally.

2192
02:34:19,427 --> 02:34:26,293
[SPEAKER_08]: So, moral of the story, watch what you click on on Facebook because some of that stuff is like apps and who knows what.

2193
02:34:27,574 --> 02:34:27,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2194
02:34:28,667 --> 02:34:40,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, and then the kicker after that was like a few seconds later, a few of my friends from TED is like, why are you linking me with this, you know, attachment?

2195
02:34:40,732 --> 02:34:57,900
[SPEAKER_10]: I just found out that, you know, this thing after I just did whatever it told me, it ended up spreading the attachment message across all my other friends, and so I hated that.

2196
02:34:58,979 --> 02:35:01,260
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I guess I ended up just saying, you know what?

2197
02:35:01,900 --> 02:35:02,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget it.

2198
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:11,104
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to close up my Facebook account and whatnot and change my password and that type of stuff.

2199
02:35:11,564 --> 02:35:12,665
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably for the best.

2200
02:35:12,725 --> 02:35:18,727
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get hacked like that, you definitely want to close it up and delete all the crap and change your password as soon as you can.

2201
02:35:19,127 --> 02:35:21,388
[SPEAKER_08]: So some good tips for the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.

2202
02:35:22,008 --> 02:35:23,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful what you click on.

2203
02:35:25,604 --> 02:35:27,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, stick to the porn sites you know.

2204
02:35:27,986 --> 02:35:30,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Amiga77, we're going to let you go buddy so we can get another call.

2205
02:35:30,587 --> 02:35:31,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, okay?

2206
02:35:31,707 --> 02:35:32,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, bye bye.

2207
02:35:34,049 --> 02:35:34,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful what you click on.

2208
02:35:34,989 --> 02:35:38,891
[SPEAKER_08]: And see, Microsoft would have you believe that that's how your Xbox is getting hacked, but we'll see.

2209
02:35:39,251 --> 02:35:40,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we got another call on the line.

2210
02:35:40,632 --> 02:35:41,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Sausage Radio, who's this?

2211
02:35:42,533 --> 02:35:42,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

2212
02:35:43,273 --> 02:35:45,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Sausage Radio, who's this?

2213
02:35:46,995 --> 02:35:48,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, wait a minute, I got a lag going on here.

2214
02:35:48,976 --> 02:35:49,276
[SPEAKER_11]: One second.

2215
02:35:49,316 --> 02:35:50,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we'll wait, it's cool.

2216
02:35:52,319 --> 02:35:53,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sorry about that.

2217
02:35:53,100 --> 02:35:56,342
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the show running while I was waiting for you to pick up.

2218
02:35:56,542 --> 02:35:56,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

2219
02:35:57,903 --> 02:35:58,803
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Kaijudo.

2220
02:35:58,863 --> 02:35:59,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Kaijudo, what's on your mind?

2221
02:36:00,664 --> 02:36:00,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Not much.

2222
02:36:01,004 --> 02:36:02,225
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just calling to cover a few things.

2223
02:36:02,245 --> 02:36:04,287
[SPEAKER_11]: First off, I want to say thanks for my prize.

2224
02:36:04,587 --> 02:36:05,247
[SPEAKER_11]: I finally got it.

2225
02:36:05,667 --> 02:36:08,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we were kind of late in sending it, but yeah, we got it.

2226
02:36:08,609 --> 02:36:09,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't even worry about that.

2227
02:36:09,350 --> 02:36:10,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just calling to say thanks.

2228
02:36:10,310 --> 02:36:15,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I wasn't going to rub it in or say, you know, you took forever or anything like that.

2229
02:36:15,694 --> 02:36:21,057
[SPEAKER_08]: It took until we finally got another eBay shipment out where we just sent it along with the eBay stuff, so yeah.

2230
02:36:21,317 --> 02:36:22,738
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2231
02:36:45,627 --> 02:36:46,368
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2232
02:36:47,549 --> 02:36:50,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember when I got that fake, it was Assassin's Creed?

2233
02:36:51,012 --> 02:36:52,033
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I didn't hear what he said.

2234
02:36:52,333 --> 02:36:54,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, one of you signed it, your mom.

2235
02:36:54,455 --> 02:36:54,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2236
02:36:54,815 --> 02:36:55,956
[SPEAKER_08]: And my mom opened the package.

2237
02:36:56,497 --> 02:36:56,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

2238
02:36:59,484 --> 02:37:01,226
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

2239
02:37:02,187 --> 02:37:06,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Another thing I want to get to is you mentioned earlier I'm not an Xbox fanboy.

2240
02:37:06,852 --> 02:37:07,552
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just a gamer.

2241
02:37:07,713 --> 02:37:08,594
[SPEAKER_11]: I love all the systems.

2242
02:37:09,254 --> 02:37:14,099
[SPEAKER_11]: You mentioned before that you couldn't remove your credit card from Xbox Live.

2243
02:37:15,240 --> 02:37:15,941
[SPEAKER_11]: You can actually do it.

2244
02:37:15,961 --> 02:37:16,922
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to call in

2245
02:37:19,411 --> 02:37:22,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hate that I have to do that.

2246
02:37:23,014 --> 02:37:28,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate that they're allowed to make it so easy to give it to them and then it's not as easy to take it away.

2247
02:37:28,959 --> 02:37:37,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I get the business side of it and everything, but just after everything I've been through with that company, it's like I'm almost insulted.

2248
02:37:38,286 --> 02:37:42,067
[SPEAKER_08]: That they would make me go through that after getting hacked and all that stuff.

2249
02:37:42,147 --> 02:37:46,788
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that's probably what I'll end up doing is I'll call them and get it taken off that way.

2250
02:37:47,088 --> 02:37:50,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess my point is at the end of the day, it just sucks that I have to do that.

2251
02:37:50,989 --> 02:37:54,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't I take it off the account as easy as I was able to put it on the account?

2252
02:37:55,870 --> 02:37:59,470
[SPEAKER_11]: The other weird thing about it is if you do want to remove it midway through your...

2253
02:38:02,555 --> 02:38:06,879
[SPEAKER_11]: through your billing cycle, they tell you that you'll lose your Xbox Live.

2254
02:38:06,899 --> 02:38:13,404
[SPEAKER_11]: You can have the card removed, but you'll lose whatever that amount of weeks or amount of days that you have left on gold.

2255
02:38:13,644 --> 02:38:16,146
[SPEAKER_08]: In my opinion, that's kind of bullshit too.

2256
02:38:16,186 --> 02:38:17,768
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a real problem I have with it.

2257
02:38:17,808 --> 02:38:20,610
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're not really getting the card off your account.

2258
02:38:20,650 --> 02:38:22,211
[SPEAKER_08]: You're telling them that you want to cancel.

2259
02:38:23,092 --> 02:38:26,655
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to cancel you because you don't want to keep a credit card on file with them?

2260
02:38:26,975 --> 02:38:28,837
[SPEAKER_06]: And you already paid for it at the beginning of the year.

2261
02:38:28,857 --> 02:38:29,237
[SPEAKER_08]: There's proof.

2262
02:38:29,477 --> 02:38:35,520
[SPEAKER_08]: When there's proof that that credit card information is being exploited, and they just don't want to admit it, that pisses me off.

2263
02:38:36,040 --> 02:38:36,440
[SPEAKER_11]: It's crazy.

2264
02:38:36,480 --> 02:38:37,280
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm going through now.

2265
02:38:37,320 --> 02:38:43,423
[SPEAKER_11]: I spoke with someone, and you also have to call them to have the automatic renewal removed.

2266
02:38:44,003 --> 02:38:44,724
[SPEAKER_11]: But not anymore.

2267
02:38:44,744 --> 02:38:52,407
[SPEAKER_11]: I called to say that I wanted the renewal removed, and when my subscription is up, I want the card removed, and then I'll just pay through.

2268
02:38:53,327 --> 02:39:09,921
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever that is now supposedly the automatic renewal is all you're able to do that on the website because that was part of the big upgrades they did this week that Jamie was talking about earlier is that you know you can turn that automatic renewal off and I did see that switch so that has changed recently as in like the past week week and a half

2269
02:39:10,541 --> 02:39:15,845
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as the credit cards go, I went in there and I saw a place where you could click remove to remove the credit card.

2270
02:39:16,145 --> 02:39:24,692
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I tried to do that, it said, oh, you can't do that because you're using that card to pay for your one month of Xbox Live that you used a card for.

2271
02:39:25,032 --> 02:39:27,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a credit card, but like an over-the-counter card.

2272
02:39:27,174 --> 02:39:27,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, what?

2273
02:39:28,435 --> 02:39:28,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

2274
02:39:30,796 --> 02:39:34,659
[SPEAKER_11]: and two other quick things and then I'll let you get to some more calls.

2275
02:39:34,819 --> 02:39:38,961
[SPEAKER_11]: The Saints Row, when I mentioned was it the day improved from Saints Row 2?

2276
02:39:39,801 --> 02:39:50,548
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing I was talking about with the camera was I remember in Saints Row 2 they didn't have, you know like GTA 4, you have like three different I think camera angles you can do.

2277
02:39:50,928 --> 02:39:54,470
[SPEAKER_11]: You can be like up close, you could be like midway and then like really far back.

2278
02:39:54,950 --> 02:39:56,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Saints Row 2 didn't have any of that.

2279
02:39:56,391 --> 02:39:59,053
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like your character was always in the way of your...

2280
02:39:59,853 --> 02:40:02,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Your little rectical thing.

2281
02:40:02,595 --> 02:40:04,537
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm talking about?

2282
02:40:04,557 --> 02:40:05,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

2283
02:40:05,578 --> 02:40:05,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2284
02:40:06,038 --> 02:40:07,299
[SPEAKER_11]: So did they improve on that?

2285
02:40:07,539 --> 02:40:09,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's what really killed it for me.

2286
02:40:09,621 --> 02:40:12,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I couldn't see what I was shooting at, and especially in multiplayer.

2287
02:40:12,703 --> 02:40:19,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they don't have multiplayer anymore, but it was really hard to play multiplayer when your character is so blown up in front of you like that.

2288
02:40:19,889 --> 02:40:19,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

2289
02:40:20,969 --> 02:40:23,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I never really had that problem, but I mean, I don't know.

2290
02:40:24,631 --> 02:40:27,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think they have any sort of way.

2291
02:40:28,172 --> 02:40:33,434
[SPEAKER_06]: You can adjust, I think your camera, you might be able to adjust your camera distance.

2292
02:40:34,014 --> 02:40:35,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me try to look here real quick.

2293
02:40:38,035 --> 02:40:39,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Vehicle camera stamp.

2294
02:40:40,196 --> 02:40:41,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Instant, yeah.

2295
02:40:41,576 --> 02:40:44,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they have a way to adjust the camera.

2296
02:40:44,878 --> 02:40:45,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here we go.

2297
02:40:45,518 --> 02:40:45,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's...

2298
02:40:47,431 --> 02:40:49,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no, I don't see a way to adjust the camera.

2299
02:40:50,394 --> 02:41:04,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, there is, I guess, you know, you can manually adjust it, but, um, yeah, I will find it, you know, it's really a problem being in the way, because you do have the aiming reticle on the screen, so, uh, you can see where you're shooting at.

2300
02:41:07,267 --> 02:41:08,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you remember playing Saints Row 2?

2301
02:41:09,087 --> 02:41:10,548
[SPEAKER_11]: How long ago was it?

2302
02:41:10,748 --> 02:41:11,828
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played it.

2303
02:41:12,449 --> 02:41:13,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I got that game.

2304
02:41:13,209 --> 02:41:13,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not even kidding.

2305
02:41:14,469 --> 02:41:22,692
[SPEAKER_11]: I got Saints Row 2 the first day it came out, and I maybe played it for two weeks, and I haven't played it since the original year that it came out.

2306
02:41:24,153 --> 02:41:27,374
[SPEAKER_11]: The driving and that close-up camera just really...

2307
02:41:28,010 --> 02:41:28,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Screwed the game up for me.

2308
02:41:29,171 --> 02:41:31,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I never really had trouble with the camera at all.

2309
02:41:31,693 --> 02:41:33,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember the driving being too bad.

2310
02:41:33,554 --> 02:41:39,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I played that game to almost 100%, and I played Saints Row 1 all the way to 100%.

2311
02:41:39,979 --> 02:41:46,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's including the three DLCs for the second game as well.

2312
02:41:47,584 --> 02:41:50,066
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, I don't remember it being a problem.

2313
02:41:50,306 --> 02:41:50,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2314
02:41:50,747 --> 02:41:54,269
[SPEAKER_06]: This one doesn't seem to be a problem so far, and I'm about 40% through.

2315
02:41:55,593 --> 02:41:58,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm still going to get three, just with everything it has in it.

2316
02:41:58,315 --> 02:42:00,155
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm just curious about that.

2317
02:42:00,536 --> 02:42:04,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, I can take screenshots in the game, which is pretty awesome.

2318
02:42:04,177 --> 02:42:06,319
[SPEAKER_06]: You can upload them to the SaintsRow.com site.

2319
02:42:06,739 --> 02:42:10,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wish I did that when I saw Professor Genki shooting rockets at pedestrians.

2320
02:42:10,941 --> 02:42:12,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, whoa, what's that?

2321
02:42:13,502 --> 02:42:14,283
[SPEAKER_06]: That's different.

2322
02:42:15,383 --> 02:42:17,326
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to miss multiplayer in this one.

2323
02:42:17,346 --> 02:42:27,440
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the one game that they removed multiplayer where I'm like, I have no problem with that because that multiplayer, I hate to admit it, it was terrible for me.

2324
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:28,282
[SPEAKER_06]: It could have been better.

2325
02:42:28,322 --> 02:42:29,243
[SPEAKER_06]: They could have fixed it.

2326
02:42:30,222 --> 02:42:30,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that's it.

2327
02:42:30,962 --> 02:42:32,443
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been playing Skyrim.

2328
02:42:32,883 --> 02:42:33,444
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great game.

2329
02:42:33,664 --> 02:42:34,244
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know that.

2330
02:42:34,964 --> 02:42:36,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone who hasn't picked it up, pick it up.

2331
02:42:36,885 --> 02:42:38,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm freaking loving it.

2332
02:42:38,806 --> 02:42:39,747
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have a nice night.

2333
02:42:40,087 --> 02:42:42,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, no problem.

2334
02:42:42,288 --> 02:42:43,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy your bootleg copy.

2335
02:42:43,749 --> 02:42:44,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, take care.

2336
02:42:45,289 --> 02:42:45,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2337
02:42:46,730 --> 02:42:48,331
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2338
02:42:48,371 --> 02:42:49,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Good calls tonight.

2339
02:42:49,152 --> 02:42:49,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, you guys.

2340
02:42:49,832 --> 02:42:55,076
[SPEAKER_08]: To those that didn't get through, I'm very sorry, but did you catch the part where we said we had no emails this week?

2341
02:42:55,416 --> 02:42:55,516
[SPEAKER_08]: One.

2342
02:42:55,596 --> 02:42:57,277
[SPEAKER_08]: We had one that came in right before the show.

2343
02:42:57,698 --> 02:42:59,879
[SPEAKER_08]: So you should write down your thoughts, and we'll read them next week.

2344
02:42:59,919 --> 02:43:04,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at orangeentree.com, or you can tweet us at twitter.com slash OLR.

2345
02:43:05,203 --> 02:43:08,245
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, in the meantime, I need to finish up just a couple tweets here that we had.

2346
02:43:08,725 --> 02:43:13,769
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya tweeted us and said, so the DDR freak thing is still sort of happening in Milpitas.

2347
02:43:13,969 --> 02:43:14,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Road trip?

2348
02:43:15,350 --> 02:43:16,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I heard about that.

2349
02:43:16,152 --> 02:43:18,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a Facebook invite for that today.

2350
02:43:20,403 --> 02:43:20,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe?

2351
02:43:22,847 --> 02:43:47,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know it's kind of one of those we have a show I don't know we'll see um I'd like to go but it just might be too last minute for me I got something else going on next weekend too uh Actdeft last tweet tonight sequence that rhythm rpg game for cheap if enough users subscribe to the page game getter uh getter.gforums.net I guess uh

2352
02:43:48,965 --> 02:43:49,847
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2353
02:44:02,410 --> 02:44:02,990
[SPEAKER_08]: What page is that?

2354
02:44:03,611 --> 02:44:08,773
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getter.g-forums.net Look at the tweets to OLR.

2355
02:44:09,153 --> 02:44:15,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Because right now the game usually costs $5 and right now it's down to $3 because 101 people have subscribed.

2356
02:44:15,835 --> 02:44:17,196
[SPEAKER_08]: But what are you subscribing to?

2357
02:44:18,316 --> 02:44:19,217
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to be careful.

2358
02:44:20,457 --> 02:44:21,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully you're not subscribing to spam.

2359
02:44:22,898 --> 02:44:24,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that does it for tweets tonight.

2360
02:44:24,679 --> 02:44:27,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go around quickly and see if there's any last minute stories.

2361
02:44:27,260 --> 02:44:29,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've covered everything but I'll check with Loki real quick.

2362
02:44:29,741 --> 02:44:30,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, any last minute stories tonight?

2363
02:44:31,149 --> 02:44:31,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge

02:44:57,951 --> 02:45:12,686
[SPEAKER_06]: and then of course the season pass the first season pass has been announced and this includes the DLC or at least the first three DLCs that are going to be coming out and if you ordered this game off of THQ their store you actually got it for free

2365
02:45:14,567 --> 02:45:38,084
[SPEAKER_06]: and in season pass we'll save you 15% off of buying the DLC separately and so what it includes is Genki Bowl 7 which is supposed to be coming out in January and the description is the wild world of Genki takes over Steelport in a sporting tradition totally and utterly unlike anything else and this is why I was laughing before

2366
02:45:38,704 --> 02:45:43,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Gangstas in Space is the second DLC coming Winter 2012.

2367
02:45:43,247 --> 02:45:48,291
[SPEAKER_06]: The Saints Go Intergalactic in the Science Fiction Misadventure.

2368
02:45:48,671 --> 02:45:51,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last one is Trouble with Clones.

2369
02:45:52,333 --> 02:45:53,574
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's coming Spring 2012.

2370
02:45:54,115 --> 02:45:57,297
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says a copycat killing at its finest.

2371
02:45:58,177 --> 02:46:05,082
[SPEAKER_06]: And also it includes the Nightblade DLC, which includes... And Nightblade is one of the fictional, like,

2372
02:46:07,060 --> 02:46:12,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Nightblade Mobile, Alter Boy Outfit, Bloody Kenanus Outfit, and Bloody Kenanus Bike Which I believe is $20

2373
02:46:28,678 --> 02:46:37,524
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, we talked a little bit about some cool streaming of game demos on YouTube.

2374
02:46:38,785 --> 02:46:42,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, now there's one for Dead Rising 2.

2375
02:46:42,327 --> 02:46:46,390
[SPEAKER_06]: They can stream through your web browser using Gaikai.

2376
02:46:47,330 --> 02:46:53,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't believe it's on YouTube, but let's see here.

2377
02:46:55,296 --> 02:47:16,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom Unity had a link to it and I believe it's actually it's on through Gaikai.com so if you go there you can check it out it's a 30 minute demo that's pretty awesome wow that's that's that same site that had the FIFA demo that we talked about a couple weeks ago yeah nice very cool

2378
02:47:18,137 --> 02:47:18,417
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2379
02:47:19,659 --> 02:47:19,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

2380
02:47:19,979 --> 02:47:22,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it for the stories?

2381
02:47:22,222 --> 02:47:22,502
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2382
02:47:22,562 --> 02:47:25,326
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking at these leaked costumes.

2383
02:47:25,586 --> 02:47:26,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I saw that from HitStun.

2384
02:47:26,887 --> 02:47:31,333
[SPEAKER_08]: It had posted a link in chat for the Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom 3 download costumes.

2385
02:47:32,068 --> 02:47:33,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there's like a Weapon X Wolverine.

2386
02:47:34,469 --> 02:47:34,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

2387
02:47:35,070 --> 02:47:35,790
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty cool.

2388
02:47:36,010 --> 02:47:39,652
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of Beautiful Joe out of costume.

2389
02:47:39,852 --> 02:47:45,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so glad now in retrospect that we didn't buy Marvel vs. Capcom 3 now that there's the ultimate one that's coming out.

2390
02:47:45,215 --> 02:47:46,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I bought it, but you know, I'm cool.

2391
02:47:47,056 --> 02:47:52,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there's one of What's Her Face, the other chick from Devil May Cry with the white hair.

2392
02:47:52,921 --> 02:47:53,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

2393
02:47:53,902 --> 02:47:54,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

2394
02:47:55,083 --> 02:47:55,343
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2395
02:47:55,363 --> 02:47:57,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lodge Radio.

2396
02:47:57,665 --> 02:47:58,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God.

2397
02:47:58,385 --> 02:47:59,826
[SPEAKER_15]: The worst ever character.

2398
02:48:00,487 --> 02:48:00,567
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2399
02:48:02,509 --> 02:48:08,994
[SPEAKER_15]: There's one of Iron Patriot, who was the character that I hated during the whole Civil War thing.

2400
02:48:10,395 --> 02:48:11,616
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is actually pretty cool.

2401
02:48:11,756 --> 02:48:14,638
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Clone Spidey, the Ben Reilly Spidey.

2402
02:48:15,089 --> 02:48:16,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we gotta wrap it up.

2403
02:48:16,229 --> 02:48:20,831
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna close up shop and say goodnight for now until we see you next week.
