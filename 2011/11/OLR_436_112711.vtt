00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
All Games Radio is now broadcasting live from Sacramento, California.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Up next, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
The following program is intended for mature audiences.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Tonight, November 27th, 2011, a special connect for Windows is detailed.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
One group of people want Skyrim to be banned.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
And is Sony planning an answer to Smash Brothers?

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
We are live at All Games Radio, where we do tape live every Sunday night

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
www.allgames.com if you want to tune in to listen.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Also, joining us, excuse me, my name is Rob Roberts.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
I should introduce myself first, then I'll introduce the co-host.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Like, who's this guy? I just downloaded this show. Who's this guy?

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm Rob Roberts, and joining me as they always do, week after week,

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
for the past nine and a half years, say hello to the one and only

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Hi.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
How are you?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm almost full.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah?

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
I made lamb leg with parsnips in the slow cooker.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
And then I took the broth, so it's got all that good meat fat in it.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Food, food, food, food, food, food, food.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
And cooked quinoa in it, so now my quinoa's creamy.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Now, I notice in your other hand, you have an old friend of the show

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
who's been gone for, like, several years.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
He ran away to die.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Makes his triumphant return to the show tonight.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Are you gonna say hello?

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah, but this is gonna break your heart, or my heart, anyway.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
All right, here we go.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, he's working now.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
He was going...

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
When I pressed it earlier.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
It's the O.L.R. Ferret, the official orange laundry...

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, God.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
He's not doing healthy after all these years.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
He might need to have an operation.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
You might have to open up his butt and replace the battery.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Gosh.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Well...

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Oh, but look at that face.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
The orange laundry radio ferret is slowly dying, ladies and gentlemen.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Just like the quality of this program.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Say hello as well.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
He's gonna model my quinoa.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I don't know why you're bothering to take a picture of it,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
because we have no website right now, but hey.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
The flicker still works.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
That's true, the flicker still works.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Get it up there when it comes back.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
Joining us as well, hopefully not about to soon die.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
He'll be with us for a long, long time.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah, you can replace the batteries in those by cutting the stomach open.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
We need an operation.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
I did that one time.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Remember, we had like four ferrets at one time.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I do.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I don't know where they went.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
You came into the show one time and you were like,

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Hey, Jamie, here.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
And you threw like five ferrets at her.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
And I held them all the entire episode because they were my babies.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
We mailed one to one of our friends in Colorado, Rai Chan.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
I don't know if she still listens, but she's out there.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
And I think we gave another one to a long time OLR listener.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Didn't one of them get stuck to a Katamari?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah, we put one on the giant Katamari ball, one E3.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
We did that.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
So they kind of slowly went their separate ways.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
And now we have the old school original one is still here.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
So our little unofficial official mascot of Orange Laundry radio.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
So yeah, a lot of things are broken.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Not only is my introduction broken tonight, but in the ferret is slowly dying.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
But obviously we weren't here last week because of the last minute internet

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
failure.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
It was not a planned absence for us.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
But unfortunately, the internet was down at dark sacros all day long.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Right.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Like, and you were having problems before that.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Oh, yeah.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Every time it rains, Comcast goes for fuck's sake.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
So but thankfully.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
So around four o'clock that day, we just had to make a decision like,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
OK, well, we can't even really tape a show without internet because we use

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
internet to get our stories and to do some of the other incidental background

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
music and stuff.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
So we couldn't do a show period.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
We said, and we'll just take the week off anyway.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
It's right before Thanksgiving.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
So whatever.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
A lot of shows are going to be off.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
We're back here tonight to news that we don't have a website right now.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I know when you go to Orange Laundry radio.com,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
it says something about an account billing issue.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
That's actually not the issue.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
It's not something as obvious as Rob didn't pay the bill.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Is the man bringing us down?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
It is.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
It is.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
It's SOPA.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
It went into effect, everybody.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Unfortunately, because we play music during the show.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
No, it's not.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
It's the one percent.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
It's the man.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
No, here's the thing.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Our website space has been graciously donated for the past.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
When did we move off of my personal domain?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
It was about seven years ago.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
So, I mean, it was a long, long time ago.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
We were on live 365.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Let me put it that way.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
It was a long time ago.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
We had our website.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
It's been graciously donated by one of our listeners and friends,

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
IRL and former DER Freak moderator when there was a DDR Freak, VX Jason XV.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
And, you know, he's been able to get the web space for us.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And I think it's like a friend of a friend thing.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
And unfortunately, when things break, because we don't pay for it,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
that doesn't mean things get fixed right away.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
So we have to understand that, you know, beggars can't be choosers.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
So he is aware.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
He's working on it.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Don't pester him about it.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
He knows.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
And I know he's working really hard to try and fix it one way or another,

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
even if that ends up meaning we have to kind of get web space somewhere else.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
So keep an eye on our Twitter at twitter.com slash O-L-R or our Facebook.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
And we'll let you know what's going on with the website as we know.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Unfortunately, this does mean that it affects the podcast folks,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
because without a website, we can't deliver the podcast.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
So the only people here in the show right now are our live listeners.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And it probably won't make the feed tonight,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
which is unfortunate because we've been on a really good track record

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
of getting the show up for the Monday morning crowd.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
And sadly, it won't be there for them tonight.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
But we'll get it up as soon as we possibly can.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
So hopefully, you podcastees will be listening to this before too long.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
So let's see.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Going to our chat room.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Our chat room is still there.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
And usually, I say join us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
but that's not going to work due to the website outage.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
So tonight, you can do it one of two ways.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
You go to Game Search, which is our network on – well, not our network,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
but the network we use on IRC.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
Gamesurge.net and any IRC clients, there's an IRC.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
And you join Channel Orange Lounge.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Honestly, if that's too difficult, just go to chat.allgames.com

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
and they'll point you in the right direction.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
And my apologies to the fine folks at All Games Chat,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
but they'll understand, I hope.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
So anyhow, before we get into our gaming weeks and all that,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I thought we could talk a little bit about this.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
It's something I kind of wanted to talk about last week.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
We didn't end up having a show.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Sorry.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
It's not your fault. Just things happen.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
We'll talk a little bit about charity.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Because, you know, tis the season.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
It's the holidays and stuff.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And this is the season where charity donations

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
and things like that really kick into high gear.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
You know, as people are out spending like mad,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
killing each other over $2 waffle irons and so forth.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You know, there's –

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Waffle irons for $2?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Waffle irons for $2, you say?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Yes, just try not to get clobbered with one.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
You see the YouTube of all them people fighting over $2 waffle irons?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
It's quite a sight to be held.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
That's stupid. You want to hear something else that's stupid?

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
We got back after having Thanksgiving dinner with our family,

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
and we came home and we're like,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
crap, there's like nothing to do.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Let's watch TV.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Hey, look. Lady Gaga's having a Thanksgiving special.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I didn't see it, believe it or not.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
She made waffles with –

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
or I wouldn't say she made waffles.

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
A chef that makes food for her was making waffles with salami in them.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
That's weird, but I'd try it.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Were you tempted by Gaga's delicious waffles?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I think you were.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Waffles are good, but it was weird.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Waffle Gaga.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Lady Waf Waf.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
That sounds kind of dirty.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
It does a little bit.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
So anyhow, charity. Hello.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Going back to charity.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
I know Child's Play is obviously one of the biggest gamer charities,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
and they've kicked off their official donation season,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
you know, during the holidays.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
There's been a lot of stuff going on, like Desert Bus.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Gosh, this has been, what, the fifth year I think that's been going on.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
If you don't know what Desert Bus is,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I don't think you've been following a lot of the gaming internet stuff,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
but we'll explain it anyway.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
There's this game that came out on –

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
God, what system was Desert Bus on?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Was that a 3DO game?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
It was on some obscure-ish system, wasn't it?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
That was on the Sega CD.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
That was part of the – wasn't that part of the Penn and Teller game?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
That was on the Sega CD.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Was it the Sega CD?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
It was Penn and Teller's up in – or Smoke and Mirrors.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I knew it was one of those CD systems I didn't have.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
And, like, you drive a bus for, like, the whole thing.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
And the deal is you drive a bus from L.A. to Vegas,

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
but don't expect the graphics to look like, you know,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
burnout or something.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Wasn't the whole thing is that they hate video games or something,

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
so they made a video game or –

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Yeah.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Yeah.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
So –

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Or something about the realism or something.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah, and you really drive the actual distance.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
It's not abbreviated.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
And you're not allowed to drive above a certain mileage

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
because you're driving a bus.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
So to drive from one to the other takes, like, four hours.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
And all you do – and you can't just, like, rubber-band the button down

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
or anything because every so often you have to slightly adjust your steering

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
or the bus will go off track.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah, because the alignment's not correct.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Exactly.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
So when you make it all the way, you score one point.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
It takes, like, four hours to do so.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
So these crazy guys actually put together this whole thing

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
where they drive back and forth for – I think they went for six days this year.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
They played desert.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
I don't think it was the same guy, but this group did it for, like,

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
six days straight and they raised a shit-ton of money for Child's Play,

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
which is great.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Well over $300,000.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
Something we've talked about a lot on this show is something a little more local to us that goes on,

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
and that's UmLoud, which is, again, happening this year, December 8th.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
On – it's a Thursday this year.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
And Dark Soccer and myself, I believe we're both going to be there this year.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
We're going.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
So we hope to see you guys there.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
That's at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
There's going to be an online component this year.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I guess more information on that is coming soon.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
So even if you don't live in the San Francisco area, there is going to be ways you can participate,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
but the details on that are forthcoming.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
And the other thing I'd mention, too, in case you want to experience Desert Bus,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
it is now on iOS and Android marketplaces.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Yes. Yes, it is. It is.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
And apparently there's a pop-up version.

11:02.000 --> 11:10.000
Which is nice because they actually donate all the proceeds for the iOS 1 to the Child's Play charity.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
And I want to say, wasn't that the one where Penn Jillette actually ended up donating money?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I don't think it was this year. I think it was last year or something.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
He donated quite a bit of money. Like, he actually knew about it.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
So it's kind of neat.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
So anyhow, lots of charity stuff going on.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
So, you know, think about some of that money you saved on all those Black Friday sales or Steam sales or so forth.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Think about giving it to a good cause.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
And even if that cause is not Child's Play for you, maybe it's, I don't know, St. Jude's Hospital,

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
March for Babies, American Red Cross, whatever the charity is.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
Although about the American Red Cross, though, keep your money out of those guys

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
ringing the bells in front of retail stores.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
The Salvation Army?

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah, I thought that was Red Cross, but Salvation Army.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
Don't give them any money because, especially now, I guess they're taking credit cards as well.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
I mean, do I really want to slide a credit card through a skimmer that they may have

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
so that I can hopefully get the money going to them and not some crook?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Just do it through online if you're going to do that.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Do you have views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio? Not necessarily?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Alright, anyway.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Well, actually, they have caught a number of scammers.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Just be careful. Always be careful.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Get a receipt.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Do it through the websites.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
Or just do Desert Bus or UMLoud because those are two ones we know, or Child's Play themselves,

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
and those are several different ones we know are reputable and all that.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
Anyhow, let's move on. Let's talk about video games and how was your gaming week,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
the video games you've been playing this week.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I don't know about you guys, but I've played a ton, so let's go around the table.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
We'll start with Dark Soccer. Ladies first.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
Well, I actually played some stuff while my internet was sort of working.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
I actually played a lot of Droplets, Rob.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
That's that random-ass puzzle game that's on Steam, huh?

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, it's actually pretty funny. Funny. Fun, I should say.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
I don't want to say it's like Pipe Dream, but it does involve pipes and water going through,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
but it's all like they're falling.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
But you run out of drops.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah, it's kind of interesting.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
And you have to collect them in your reservoir and get more,

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
and you can actually get little pockets that will open up that you can get more drops.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
And so you get a score as long as you have drops to play with.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
Actually, I have to look at my Steam list because I have to look at what I was like.

13:35.000 --> 13:42.000
I actually played a bunch of Portal 2 as well, just, you know, again, while my internet was not working.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Let me throw this out there while you're pulling up the list,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
because actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrady.com

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
is jumping in on the charity discussion with another suggestion,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
and that is do the Humble Indie Bundle.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
And that's a very good point, because the Humble Indie Bundle,

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
that money you can choose if you want the money to go all to the developers

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
or you want to go all to Child's Play or EFF.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
You can, you know, kind of choose how the money is distributed.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I don't think they have a bundle going on right now.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
There's a different type of bundle we're going to talk about a little later in the show,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
but as far as the gaming bundle, there's nothing right now,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
but there probably will be one soon enough.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Those have been doing very well, so we'll see.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
I was also playing some Doom 2.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
And, where else was I? Oh yeah, I was playing Peggle Extreme.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
I tried to play Magica, but while my internet was down, it was like,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
no, you can't play this game.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
And then a few people actually all gave me the same game.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
It gave me Fallout New Vegas.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Gee, tough problem.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Wait, wait, several people bought you Fallout New Vegas?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I know it was on sale earlier this week.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I guess so. I mean, maybe it was like...

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Was it on your wish list or something?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I think it might have been.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Ah, there you go.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
I mean, I can look, but yeah, Fallout New Vegas is actually really sweet.

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
I put up a couple of screenies from, I can pull up my Steam account

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
and show people a few screenies, but I mean,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I had never really had much of an interest in playing it,

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
but when I started playing it, it really,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
I had friends that played the RPG and kind of seeing their books

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
and seeing how the game set up, it actually kind of seemed like the same,

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
you know, had the same feel, except then you're, you know,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
first person or you can play third person.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
You can play behind the shoulder.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
So I didn't actually get as bad motion sick as I might have.

15:32.000 --> 15:38.000
However, I am incredibly lost after killing a few geckos in the face,

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
which is funny because they die ugly and I think it's awesome,

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
and I'm playing some chick with red hair.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Some chick with red hair.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Some chick with red hair.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I was corrected in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
There is a Humble Bundle going on right now. I'm so sorry.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I was not aware. This is news to me.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
This is one I might have to purchase.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
There is a Humble Bundle going on right now.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And guess what? Dark Soccer, this may interest you

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
because it is the Humble Introversion Bundle.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
And if you don't know what game they did,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
they're the folks behind Darwinia.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
So Darwinia is in this bundle as well as Uplink, Defcon,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Multiwinia is all in this.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
And if you pay more than the average, which right now is $3.75,

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
gosh, that's so low.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
I would hope you'd pay at least like $10 or $20 for this.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Aquaria and Crayon Physics Deluxe get thrown in as well.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
So there is a bundle going on right now. My apologies.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
I don't know. How much longer is that going for?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Is that like just tonight or is that going into next week?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Let's see. Eight days left. Oh shit.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
So you've got some time there.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
You got at least another week.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Usually if you wait to the end, there's more stuff tacked on.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Looks like they've already done it.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah. All right. Well, go for it.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
If you buy early, you still get the extra stuff that they end up adding.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
And what I really like about the way Humble Bundle does it

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
is that you get steam codes for everything.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
So like I bought it and then I just loaded it all into steam

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
the last time I bought one, which was the bundle that had VVVVV in it.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
So yeah, pretty cool.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
Oh yeah, I've actually played more than, oh yeah, I did play wow for the record.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm working on my rep with the Sha'tari Skyguard.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Good times.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
So I can fly around on a fat short manta ray.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
There's a birthday party going on a while right now.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Oh yeah, that thing.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
It messes up my look, Rob.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
And just a little quick side note.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
What?

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Whoever that freaking Taran was that was killing all of my birds?

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
DIAF. The end.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
And this is going to be continuing on

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
because we're not playing Grand Theft Auto anymore.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
We're playing Call of Duty now.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
This is weird to me.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
This is modern warfare. I'm still kicking ass though.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
And you know what?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
You've turned into a bro.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
It's been, what, less than a week and I'm already trying to mod the game.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
So I'm working on a mod for...

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Dan's yelling from the other room.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Make it not suck.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
I have a tangent about bros I want to talk about in a minute.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
But yeah, it's been pretty fun.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
We're playing hardcore mode because they don't like the fact that

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
I could kill faster if I have a map and I can kind of see where people are firing from.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm still killing pretty fast anyways.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
But we're just kind of playing around right now.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
System Link. And it's been fun.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
It's been great because we don't have any lag.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
And we don't have the problem with disconnects because our internet's terrible at work.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
We'd get disconnected from games all the time in Grand Theft Auto.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And funny enough now we see,

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Oh, disconnect from live. Oh, that doesn't matter because we're not playing on live.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
So we have that.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
But yeah, I am working on something actually kind of unique for it.

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
Just like some special balance mod thing where each class would have different weapons

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
and a special ability kind of like a button or something that you would have a one minute ability

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
that would be like god mode or invisibility or something like that.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
And then with a five minute cooldown for each thing.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
So it's really intricate but you can actually program quite a bit in Call of Duty which is kind of cool.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
So I'm going to mess around with that.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
Actually hopefully I'm going to mess around with Grand Theft Auto mods at some point

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
because I've just been really distracted by everything.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
I've played Saints Row. I've pretty much beat Saints Row.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Actually I have beat Saints Row. Almost 100%.

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
All the side missions and stuff were done except for the car thefts.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
And those are really annoying because it's really glitched.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
The one I was on now, apparently every time you go into the zone to steal the car,

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
it just for some reason explodes or just is gone.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
And I don't understand why because it's just something with the game. It's broken.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
So I can't really do that.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
But there's I guess ways around it and I'll eventually go back to it.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
But for the most part I have everything done.

20:06.000 --> 20:13.000
I just have to play through the game again to finish some missions in a different way.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Like Act 1, finish that in a different way.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
And then also the third act I have to finish.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Or Murder Brawl, I have to do that a different way.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
Did the Tron parody stuff in Saints Row end up being good or was it just kind of...

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Yeah, that's pretty much what you saw in the video.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
They had some interesting stuff.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
There's even a little bit of Zork in there.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Awesome. Do you get eaten by a Gru?

20:37.000 --> 20:45.000
No, there's actually a text adventure part that you have to do a little bit of stuff there.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But it's pretty awesome.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
Do you end up in front of a house and there is a white mailbox here?

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
Something like that. It's a parody of it.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
You have to go kill a unicorn is what it is.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Damn you unicorns!

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
So there's something with that. But what's kind of cool is the perks you get from beating that portion of the game.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
You actually get one of the combat tanks.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
You get to drive around the city and fire it.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
And it has all the sound effects from combat.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Which is great. It's a big blocky tank.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
And then they also have these bikes you can get that are like...

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
You get a bike and a car that look like Tron stuff.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
So that's pretty awesome.

21:25.000 --> 21:32.000
But yeah, it's pretty sweet. And then after you beat the game, obviously you can mess around and just do whatever.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
But now I have to get all the achievements for it.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Because I'm almost done. I have almost everything.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
So I have to play through as a woman now.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
So I'll be making a Dark Sakura character since you already have a character.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And I have a character.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
Apparently Travis Donovan at Undersedation Live, our buddies that are on Saturday night at All Games Radio.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
Travis Donovan made a Rob Roberts character in Saints Row who wears bunny slippers and a Hello Kitty backpack.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
Although it's not really Hello Kitty but it's their answer to that.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
So you can do all that stuff.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
He has to play through the game as a girl so he's gonna make the Dark Sakura character.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm afraid.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
She'll be wearing all black and kill things with fire.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Okay.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I kill things with fire.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I approve of the killing with fire.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
But what's great about it is you can actually go on the website.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
She should have a giant menorah she whaps people with.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
I would not do that to my menorah.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
They don't have that.

22:31.000 --> 22:39.000
What's kind of cool though is you can go on the website and you can actually tag different characters you want to download to your game.

22:39.000 --> 22:45.000
So anybody that listens to the show can go find Travis Donovan's character or you can link to it or whatever.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
And they go tag it and then download it into their game and play as you in their game.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Which is awesome.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And I forgot to bring you a copy of the game today.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
That's alright.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I had one.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
I've got so much I'm trying to play right now anyway I can use another one.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
But you really should play Saints Row the Third.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
I really do want to play Saints Row the Third especially knowing that somebody else made my damn character.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
It is awesome.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
But it actually turned out really good.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
I saw the pictures and I'm like that's cute.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
It's such a great game.

23:10.000 --> 23:18.000
It's seriously, I enjoyed every minute of it and I played it for almost, no I did play it for over 30 hours because I got that achievement.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
30 and 30 so, 3 and 30 I guess.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
So I did play over 30 hours of the game.

23:25.000 --> 23:32.000
And so yeah aside from that I've been playing Skyrim which is great.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
I almost gave it up pretty quick because the first time I played the game something glitched out.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
And I went to the first town I'm supposed to go to and everyone started attacking me.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Trying to kill me.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I'm like, okay what the fuck.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
I can't do anything because you guys keep trying to attack me.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Except for the one character I was supposed to talk to.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
He was fine but everyone's like trying to kill me.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I'm like, okay.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
I don't understand why they did the piss everybody off.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
So the hell with this.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
So I finally tried it again and I'm really enjoying it because now it's actually working correctly.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
You might have accidentally murdered somebody.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Maybe.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
Maybe I hit somebody with a sword.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Maybe I decapitated somebody and forgot.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Oops.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Well I had something earlier that I ran into.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
I decided to go exploring off and then I see this giant attacking these two people.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
So I'm going to go help them.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
So I started shooting fire at the giant.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
So people started coming and attacking me.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Because I guess some of the splash damage started hitting them.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I'm like, you fucking idiots.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
So what? You got injured a little bit.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I killed the giant for you.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
For such an enormously, enormous game.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
A game as vast as Skyrim.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
It does really have its derpy moments.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
There's some real things in Skyrim that just don't make sense.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
It should be like if you do a little bit of damage to somebody.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
They're like, hey, don't do that or something.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
And then if you continually do that, then they should start attacking you.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
But not just like, oh, I accidentally dealt a little bit of damage to you.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
Or like, oh, you ran in front of my arrow or something like that.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And unfortunately you got stuck with an arrow.

25:14.000 --> 25:20.000
They should have a little bit of like, you know, kind of, hey, stop that.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
And then start attacking you if you keep attacking them.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
I think that would be a little bit better than, oh, I accidentally hit you with a fireball.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Because I was aiming at the troll that's right next to you or something like that.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Anyways.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
I like some of the lolsy stuff people have done with Skyrim online.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Like the house full of cabbage.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Have you seen that stuff?

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
I had to fight, once again, exploring.

25:44.000 --> 25:50.000
Because I'm trying to get enough money to buy these boots that allow me to pick up more things.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
Which is ironic because I got the money, the amount of money that was in the game to do that.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
And all of a sudden I go back down to buy them.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Oh, and now they're more expensive.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
I'm like, fuck you, I'm not buying those anymore.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
But I have a lot of money now.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
So I've been just exploring in places probably that I'm not supposed to be going yet.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
And one of the places I found, all of a sudden I got attacked by three wisps.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
And I was like, oh, this sucks because I'm only like level, I think I'm like level eight.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
Or six at the time, I think, when I had attacked them.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
So I was like, ah shit, these things look magical.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
That's not good.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
So I killed them.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
And then it was the wisp mother that was there started shooting like some ice thing at me.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
And so I decided to go try to kill her.

26:35.000 --> 26:41.000
And that took about 15 to 20 minutes to actually take her down because I'm such a low level character.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
Yeah, but they level with you so it would have taken 15 to 20 minutes anyway.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Really?

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
You do get a little bit of edge because of the talents and so forth that you get.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
But unfortunately the enemies, it's not like a Final Fantasy where if you just grind, grind, grind, you'll be able to overpower everything.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
It doesn't work like that.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
But anyways, so yeah.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
Honestly, in any Elder Scrolls game you should just do the main story first.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
So that way you can just do it when it's easy and then go back and do open world lulzy fun.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Maybe we should do that then.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
That's the way to approach an Elder Scrolls game, I really think.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
So yeah, it took me about 15 minutes.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
But it's funny because, you know, you were saying the house full of cabbages and stuff.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
And the game's not exactly realistic.

27:21.000 --> 27:30.000
At one point, because I had a bunch of stuff from crafting things, either making food or making alchemy and stuff like that.

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
So I got to the point where I had exhausted my potions that I had with me and I'm like, crap, I need more health.

27:36.000 --> 27:43.000
So I ate 13 pounds of food at one point to level up.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
Your skill in pooping has increased to 21.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
It's just ridiculous.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
It's like, okay, here's this two pound cheese wheel.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
This will give you two health.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
I'm going to eat four of those.

27:59.000 --> 28:08.000
I can imagine this guy, like, high behind a rock, just shoving his mouth full of cabbage and carrots and raw rabbit.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
Just all sorts of ridiculous stuff that you happen to be carrying with you.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
And I also found another way. It was kind of fun.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
I was really sad because remember how they had the thing where, oh, you can steal from people by putting pots over people's heads?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I thought that was only on PC.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
Until I figured out you have to hold A and then you can move shit around.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I was like, oh, thank God.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
It doesn't work, though. I haven't gotten it to work at all.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Maybe there's a trick to it. I've never tried it.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Which is too bad.

28:34.000 --> 28:42.000
But it allowed me to, you know, because one of the things I kind of do is I pick up everything that is not attached.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
Which is great because you do missions for people and stuff and all of a sudden they become friendly with you.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And they'll just let you take everything.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
Like, I did a mission for the guy at the trading post or whatever.

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
And after that, everything in that house allowed me to take it almost, except for expensive armor and stuff.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
Guys, you know in our chatroom at chat.ownerswannatrader.com disagrees with me on what I'm saying about the level scaling.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Saying the enemies don't really level with you anymore in Skyrim, Rob.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
They changed it due to people not liking it in Oblivion. It's more like Fallout now, really.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
I could have sworn somebody was telling me that they were playing the game twice and saw the difference.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
But maybe it's not as much of a weight as it was before.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Who knows?

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
But I like being able to overpower everything, personally.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I hope that's true.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
I haven't played enough Skyrim. I really haven't because I've been distracted by so many other games.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
I probably will not give Skyrim proper attention until Christmas time.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Skyrim's hilarious, because at one point I was like,

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Oh, hey, wait a second. I can swim in the river.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
I'm diving underwater, and I'm catching salmon.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
For no apparent reason, other than I can.

29:51.000 --> 29:57.000
That's the whole thing about Skyrim. I don't know why I'm doing this. I can.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Or Skyrim with the physics.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Hey, you can go along this mountain trail, or you can just walk straight up the mountain.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
You'll just hit jump a lot, and you'll eventually climb the mountain.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
That's what I do.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
But yeah, I found out that if you're carrying too much, obviously it slows you down.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
So what you can do is grab one more object by holding A, and it'll just hover out in front of you,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
and then you just run back to town.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
Of course, if you get to any doorway, you'll pick it up, take it in your inventory, walk through the door,

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
drop it, and pick it up again using the hold A thing, and just keep on running.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
It was great. I was able to take one.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I brought you a pan!

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I was able to take one more battle axe.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
How stupid must that look?

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
Alright, Bobby has joined chat to try and clarify.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Our good friend Bobby Blackwolf, who tapes before us live at All Games Radio,

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
to try and clarify, bring a little clarity to the Rim of Sky.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Sky says, here's how it works.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Or Blackwolf says, Sky, here's how it works.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
When you first enter a dungeon area, it generates the enemies to your level.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
If you leave that dungeon, go level up, and go back in.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
They will be the same level they used to be, so you can overpower them, but not on the first entry.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Now, that makes a lot of sense.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
So, here's what you need to do.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
You need to find all the dungeons at level one.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Like I'm saying, go do the story mode right away.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
And then that way, you know...

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
I'm going to, but I get distracted so much.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I know. I hear you.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
Seriously, I have taken everything in that town, the first town, the Riverwood, whatever,

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
and I've taken everything that has not been bolted down.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
It's great. There's so many glitches in the game.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
Did you fill a house with cabbage?

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
I don't have a house to fill with cabbage yet, but I have a lot of cabbage.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Well, damn it, now you have a mission.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
And I've eaten a lot of cabbage, too, so that's not good.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Anything else about your gaming week?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
We could talk about Skyrim all night.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
Seriously. Like, for example, one of the tricks you can level up any skill

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
by those people that will actually tell you, like, the first town you go to,

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
there's an elf there that will help you improve your archery.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
Well, if you invite him into, you can invite him to join you,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
and he'll come and help you, so you go and you pay for that,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
and then you go, I need to trade with you, and you take your money back,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
and then you pay him again and take your money back.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
In fact, the other thing is, you can take his house key for no reason,

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
or just take all of his inventory, and then you go to his house and steal everything.

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
And then go to the middle of the forest and say, okay, wait here.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Pretty much.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
I'm always, like, I'm paranoid that my stupid NPC that always follows me,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I have this chick named Lydia that follows me everywhere,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
and I'm always paranoid she's gonna die.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
Like, I'm like, because this game, like, if a fucking wolf bites her head off,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
she's not coming back.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
Like, she won't just flash and then respawn.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
But here's the thing, though. Some of these NPCs don't die.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Because one of the things I did before I came over here, I was like,

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
hey, you know what, let me see how, if I could just kill everybody in this town.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
So I saved it before I did that, and I tried to kill everybody.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
I killed everybody except for the goddamn woman that works in the inn.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
You can kill her. First, she's a really tough son of a bitch.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
And then, on top of that...

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
You mean daughter of a bitch?

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Whatever.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
How about bitch?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Yeah, she's a really tough bitch.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
And then on top of that, you kill her, and she doesn't really die.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
She just comes back to life again and starts fucking trying to kill you again.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
She might be integral to the story or something.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Like, you probably can't kill people that, like, keep you from completing the actual story.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Eh, I don't care. I know. I know you don't care.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
Just finish the story, then go do whatever you want. Whatever you want.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Burn a whole village down for all I care, then wait for the DLC.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Alright. Anything else for your gaming week?

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
Uh... a little bit of Zuma. That's it.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Let me move on. I got some games I want to talk about.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I've played a lot. I can only talk about some of the games I've played this week,

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
because I've played a lot in the past couple weeks since we last had a show.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
So let me start with the one I've probably played the least of,

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
which is Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I bought this more for Alan because he wanted it.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
And keep in mind, we didn't own Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
It's like we knew that they were going to release a new version just nine months later.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
So we ordered that over Amazon.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
They always do.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
I know. I know that for next time now.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
So I'm going to be wary about buying Capcom games when they first come out.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
Like, I'm going to have to be convinced they're not going to release an Uber edition six months later.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
But anyway, so it's really my first taste of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at all.

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
The controls are weird because I guess they took more of a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom direction with them.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Yeah, exactly.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Not a fan.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
Much easier if you've got the arcade controller.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Yeah, I could see that. I could see that.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
So I'm not a fan because I like my games like Street Fighter, but that's okay.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
The art style is really good.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
It's so fun to play on an HDTV with awesome sound.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
The graphics and everything look great.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Lots of great characters.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
Some weird choices, especially on the Capcom side, but okay.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Rocket Raccoon.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
No, I said it on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
That's Marvel.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Rocket Raccoon is Marvel.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
I know.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
I said weird choices on the Capcom side, not on the Marvel side.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Right, but that's a weird one.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah, it is weird.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
I hear you.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
That's what I was saying.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
I thought you liked Rocket Raccoon.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
I do like Rocket Raccoon.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
It's just sort of out of the blue.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
So there are some weird choices in there.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
But, you know, it can't all be totally mainstream.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
That's kind of part of the fun of it.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
So yeah, I've just done some light skirmishes in that.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Very difficult game, too.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
The difficulties, even on very easy, it can be a pain in the ass.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Alan was screaming at the TV trying to beat Galacticus, or at least, you know, kinda.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
He doesn't really scream at the TV, but just in his irritated way.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Flick.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Yeah, I know, right?

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
So yeah, that was Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

35:35.000 --> 35:41.000
I bought a game on Steam that was dirt cheap last week, not during this whole Autumn sale they've been doing.

35:41.000 --> 35:48.000
But last week, they had a game called Magica on sale for like $2.50, and you could even download the demo.

35:48.000 --> 35:53.000
Or no, you downloaded the full game, and you could just play the full game for free through Sunday.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
Like, this is the kind of stuff Steam can let you do.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
So I ended up buying the Uber edition for like 9 bucks.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
It comes with all the expansions.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
I liked Magica. It was cool.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
It's kinda like it was a dungeon crawler slash puzzler slash...

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
The big thing about Magica is that you mix and match these different spell types.

36:11.000 --> 36:18.000
Like you have fire, ice, earth, lightning, arcane, life.

36:18.000 --> 36:25.000
And you can mix the different types to create these, you know, either energy bolts or like...

36:25.000 --> 36:32.000
One thing you could do, you mix shield with life, and you get like life grenades that you put in the ground.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
And when you step on them, they bloom health.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
Or you could mix shield with fire, and you get like actual grenades.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
So it's interesting kind of learning about the combinations.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
So exploration definitely plays heavy into this.

36:45.000 --> 36:51.000
This is the game as well, and I know we talked about this on the show a while back, but it had some very strange expansions.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
Like the first expansion for Magica is Magica Vietnam.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
And it's the little magic characters in Vietnam.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
And the joke is because all the shooter games end up having a Vietnam expansion.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
So Magica got a Vietnam expansion.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
There's a lot of very tongue-in-cheekness.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
The game is very tongue-in-cheek. It's sharp-witted.

37:11.000 --> 37:17.000
I think it was right after they announced the Battlefield Bad Company 2, like, Vietnam expansion.

37:17.000 --> 37:23.000
So, yeah. And then they did some other expansions after that.

37:23.000 --> 37:28.000
So, yeah. I enjoyed Magica, and it was fun to play.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
You can play it online, too. Like, Alan and I were doing co-op in the same room over Steam online.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
It was pretty fun. So you can play like I think up to four or six people at once.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
And there's all these other modes I haven't even touched yet, because, again, other games have distracted me.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
But there's like, you know, challenge modes, and PvP I guess is a big element.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
Because I got the Uber edition, I got all these different Magica types.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
And what's funny is that one of them is like a Tron dude.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
They all wear the little hooded robe things. They look like little monks.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
But this particular monk has the energy lines and carries an energy disc, right?

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
And I played that when I was playing online with Alan. He couldn't heal me.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
And we couldn't figure it out. Like, why the hell can't you heal me? I can heal you, but you can't heal me.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Well, it's because since I was playing as Tron dude, you don't heal me with life.

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
You heal me with lightning. So whenever he would shoot a lightning bolt at me, I would heal.

38:18.000 --> 38:24.000
So just funny little quirks like that were in the game and kind of lead to the puzzle elements of Magica.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
So, yeah, let's see. Other games I've been playing this week.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
Okay, here's a game I've been playing a lot of. A lot of this game.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
And I really, I don't know why. When I tell you what game it is, you're going to be like,

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
What? Out of everything out right now, you're playing that?

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
So we went to Evil G one day because we had a gift card we had to spend.

38:45.000 --> 38:51.000
So we found a game that was the perfect amount of money and it was White Knight Chronicles 2.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
I was there.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
It was on sale. Yeah, you were there. You did come with us.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
White Knight Chronicles 2 we bought on sale for 40 bucks.

38:57.000 --> 39:04.000
And it comes complete with the first game, which I did play a little bit before when it was actually done by Sony.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
But now this game has been out in Japan and Europe for a while.

39:07.000 --> 39:15.000
But D3 finally put it out here because I guess the first game didn't do so hot, but it has a real cult following to it.

39:15.000 --> 39:21.000
So now the second game's out. It's a lot like the.hack games on PS2.

39:21.000 --> 39:27.000
You can play the first game all over. Well, actually, you couldn't even do this in the.hack games because they didn't come with each game.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
But imagine if like the first.hack, what?.hack infection and the next one.

39:31.000 --> 39:37.000
Like imagine if they were bundled together. You can either start the first game, which is what they called the remastered version,

39:37.000 --> 39:45.000
although I call it the they made the annoying text box slightly less annoying and a couple other little things you probably won't notice.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
Or you could just start the second game at level 35.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
But I'm like, well, I'm going to go back and play the first game.

39:52.000 --> 39:57.000
So I've been playing the first game and I've already played it longer, much longer than I did the last time.

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
My characters are up to like level 19 or 20 at this point. And I just I keep doing side quests.

40:02.000 --> 40:08.000
I've got pulled into there's so much different types of micromanaging you can do that I think people don't even know about this game.

40:08.000 --> 40:17.000
Like you can build a whole little town and depending on the villagers that you recruit, you earn different products that are in this town.

40:17.000 --> 40:22.000
There's a whole online mode in this game that feels a lot like Phantasy Star to me.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
You team up with other people to do quests and you can do them online.

40:26.000 --> 40:33.000
But here's the thing, despite the fact that I say all this and I mentioned I've been playing this game for a lot,

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
although it lets you do these things, it does none of them remarkably well.

40:38.000 --> 40:46.000
Like it's not a bad game, but it's just a it does a lot of things, but none of them are best in class.

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
But it's like a game to get straight B's across the board.

40:51.000 --> 40:57.000
None of the like the story is not really an A. The graphics are pretty good.

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
The music's good, but it's not great. The character design, it's neat, but there's a lot of repetition.

41:02.000 --> 41:09.000
So it could be it's like it gets straight B's. But he put it all together and it makes for a really deep experience.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
It's like Xanadu.

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
I guess. I don't know. But yeah, I can't stop playing. I'm just like grind, grind, grind, grind.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
I could be playing Skyrim, yet I'm playing this game because it's like I have to beat story mode.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
I have to get to level. I have to get to the White Knight Chronicles 2.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
I have to be able to play with people online. I can't stop playing.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Couple other negatives I'll say about the game.

41:27.000 --> 41:35.000
Really disappointed that there was an online store mode where you buy things for your village like houses and scenery.

41:35.000 --> 41:43.000
But this stuff will impact the amount of stuff that you can grow, which in turn is what's for sale at your stores.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
So that's my long way of saying you can buy your way to a competitive edge in this game.

41:48.000 --> 41:58.000
And it's not just that, but they actually sell items at the Sony store that are like this coupon is good for 20% increased experience for one week.

41:58.000 --> 42:05.000
So there's a lot of like really cheap stuff like that. And I almost want to flunk the game on those grounds alone.

42:05.000 --> 42:14.000
However, I do have to realize there is this online component that they're not charging money for that does have about the depth of Phantasy Star Universe.

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
And Phantasy Star Universe does still charge money to this day. Why they just don't go free to play, I don't know.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
So I give it a slight pass on those grounds because I feel like, okay, well, fair enough.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
They are providing a robust online component. They got to make the money for that somewhere, I guess.

42:29.000 --> 42:36.000
But I do frown on the fact that they sell things to give you a competitive edge. That shit is just...

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
As a gamer, it bothers me. I don't like it in other games too.

42:40.000 --> 42:46.000
Let's see, actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangelsonshooty.com says,

42:46.000 --> 42:52.000
Wait, White Knot Chronicles 2 has both games? I'm going to tell a friend that wants it to get that instead of the first one.

42:52.000 --> 42:58.000
Oh, absolutely. The first game is pointless at this point. Like, if you can get it 10 bucks used, awesome.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
And you can import what you do in the first game into the second game. You can do that.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
You don't have to just start at level 35 because the level cap in the first game was 50.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
So you grind your way to 50 and then do it that way.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
Yeah, there's really no point. And this game is probably not that expensive.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
White Knot Chronicles 2 is 40 bucks on sale. But that was a pre-Black Friday type sale.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
When did we go to Evil G, Dark Sakura? Was that Wednesday?

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
I think so, yeah.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
You can probably find it used even cheaper somewhere else.

43:29.000 --> 43:38.000
Maybe. But be careful because it has an online pass called GeoNet. So you can't do any of the online features without the...

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
You get the one free with the new copy and then it's going to be $10 otherwise.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
It was Sunday. Sunday morning.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
That's right, because the show didn't happen.

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
Yeah. But we went in the morning because I was running away from the football game.

43:51.000 --> 43:56.000
Yeah, yeah. So anyway, White Knot Chronicles 2. Straight Bs, yet I can't stop playing it. Go figure.

43:56.000 --> 44:05.000
And then here's a game that I've also been playing a lot of. And it's Super Mario 3DS.

44:05.000 --> 44:12.000
And I gotta say, I'm just going to be blunt, this is my favorite Mario game in the past 20 years, I think. For real.

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
I think this is my favorite Mario game since Super Mario World, I think.

44:17.000 --> 44:24.000
It's great. If you own a 3DS, I don't know why you would not get this game.

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
I seriously do not know why you would be a Nintendo supporter and not want Mario 3D Land.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
It is outstanding. The level design is fantastic.

44:33.000 --> 44:40.000
There's a lot of throwbacks to a lot of things you see in the Mario series, as well as some new stuff like the whole Boomerang Mario.

44:40.000 --> 44:46.000
But yeah, I can't stop thinking about the level design. The level design is so good.

44:46.000 --> 44:58.000
They're linear levels, like what you would see in a Mario game, yet they have that slight openness of like Mario 64, yet they're not too damn open.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
Like I think some of the levels in that game and even like Galaxy and Sunshine were.

45:02.000 --> 45:08.000
Like there definitely is that Mario linear path to it. And I don't think that's a bad thing at all.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
There's just a lot of fun things that you find in different levels.

45:11.000 --> 45:18.000
Like some of them are the automatic scrolling levels. Some of them are like the donuts. Some of them are the blocks that spin.

45:18.000 --> 45:23.000
The ghost houses are back. The desert levels are there. I mean, it's all there.

45:23.000 --> 45:29.000
And from what I understand, the game, you can play through it twice because you have Mario 3D.

45:29.000 --> 45:37.000
Believe it or not, it's neat. I was not the biggest fan of Mario 64, and I've taken shit for that on this show over the years.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
And a lot of that was because I didn't like the transition from 2D to 3D.

45:41.000 --> 45:47.000
Like, you know, Mario 64 was one of the first big 3D games, and I realize a lot of people disagree with me on that, and that's fine.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
Every gamer gets their own opinion. So I was a little worried about this at first.

45:51.000 --> 46:02.000
But I think because the levels still feel somewhat linear-esque to me, but still have a sense of openness to them, I'm not bothered by the 3D at all.

46:02.000 --> 46:10.000
And the actual 3D effects are cool, and they're with purpose in some places.

46:10.000 --> 46:17.000
And, like, there's some kind of puzzle rooms, for lack of a better term, that you actually kind of use 3D in.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
Can you play it in 2D? Yes. Would it look as good? No, it doesn't look as good.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
So you think they've really got the hang of the 3D now?

46:24.000 --> 46:35.000
I do, and I'll tell you one thing I love, love, and I think all the 3DS games need to do this, is they have a switch now that not only can you adjust the intensity of the 3D,

46:35.000 --> 46:46.000
but with the switch of the D-pad, if you press the up arrow, then the 3D is up, like it's outward 3D, whereas if you hit the down arrow, it's inward 3D.

46:46.000 --> 46:52.000
That's cool. That may not make a lot of sense the way I'm saying it, but when you play it, you'll see what I mean.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
It's instead of, one will project, the other will immerse.

46:56.000 --> 47:04.000
Yes, and this can help some of the effects, like depending on your eyes, like sometimes I notice if I'm playing the projector 3D,

47:04.000 --> 47:13.000
there's these stages where these spiked ball things will kind of swing back and forth, like out.

47:13.000 --> 47:18.000
Well, sometimes the 3DS does this thing where when they swing forth, your vision starts to split.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
Get the ghosting.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
Yeah, you see the ghosting and all that, but if you do the inward 3D, I don't see that at all.

47:23.000 --> 47:31.000
That's probably how I would have to play the whole thing, given that every other thing I've played on a 3DS, I get the problem all the time.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
You can kind of choose what 3D works for you.

47:35.000 --> 47:44.000
So, let's see, go into our chatroom at chat.orangelaundryday.com and looking at some comments here.

47:44.000 --> 47:50.000
DDRDollarBill says, please tell me it's not like Mario 64. It's not like Mario 64.

47:50.000 --> 47:56.000
In my opinion, it's better, and there's going to be a lot of people that disagree with me on that, and that's fine.

47:56.000 --> 48:02.000
Let's see, SGA100Matt says, Rob, you're not the only person I've heard say this.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
Let's see, Actf says, I liked Super Mario 64, but I get why people don't like it.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
Heck, my favorite Mario game is still Super Mario World.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
Mine too. Mario 3D Land is not without flaw.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
For instance, the StreetPass stuff is weird.

48:18.000 --> 48:29.000
Like, you have these mystery boxes that are very similar to the Toad Houses, where if you can clear a mystery box in like 10 or 15 seconds, you might get a chance at a bonus coin.

48:29.000 --> 48:36.000
And I guess the deal with is that if you StreetPass with people, all it does is it's like they give you a new mystery box.

48:36.000 --> 48:43.000
And it's not necessarily one that they've played, or I don't think it really is anything but, hey, you got a little bonus because you StreetPassed with someone.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
So that's kind of a little like, boy, that seems somewhat forced.

48:47.000 --> 48:56.000
So to that, I say derp derp, but it doesn't really detract from the single-player game experience, which is still great.

48:56.000 --> 49:03.000
I mean, StreetPassing will allow you to get more bonus coins, I think, which will allow you to get some of the levels and stuff.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
But if you're really good at single-player, you could still do it.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
You know, bro, one week from today, Mario Kart 7.

49:11.000 --> 49:18.000
I know. See, there's been a lot of skepticism about the 3DS, and rightfully so.

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
Because this game blows any of the launch titles out of the fucking water, including Street Fighter IV.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Yeah, they launched with this?

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
They should have launched with this.

49:27.000 --> 49:33.000
Now, maybe there's a method to the madness, maybe they didn't want to have the sell-outs, which would seem weird for Nintendo,

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
but maybe they wanted to launch it early and have this slow build, I don't know.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
Or maybe they legitimately thought it would launch heavier than it did.

49:40.000 --> 49:45.000
But if this game can't sell the 3DS, nothing will.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
It's as simple as that.

49:49.000 --> 49:57.000
If the 3DS, if this game does not carry 3DS sales, there really is nothing else they can put out on it.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
I truly believe that.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
This Mario game is about as good as the Nintendo game gets.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
It's better than Galaxy.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
It's better than New Super Mario Bros. Wii. I really think so.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Is it better than Sunshine? Because Sunshine was pretty epic.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Yes, it's better than Sunshine.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
And some people think Sunshine was ass.

50:16.000 --> 50:22.000
I think it was a lot better than... I don't get how you can like Mario 64 and hate Sunshine,

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
but I guess it has to do with the whole water element, but whatever.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
I actually like 64 a whole lot.

50:28.000 --> 50:34.000
I like 64, but I don't think it's... I like this game better. I really do.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
This is going to be one of the best games of the year, period.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
This is a great year for games.

50:39.000 --> 50:46.000
I'm seriously sitting back going, how can I choose between Mario 3D Land, Portal 2, and Skyrim,

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
which one of these games is the best game of the year, because they are all fucking good.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Like, really fucking good.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
And there's some games I haven't even touched yet.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
I'm hearing amazing things about Zelda Skyward Sword, which I'm sure a lot of us are.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I don't think any of us in the room, oddly enough, have touched that yet,

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
but I'm hoping to get my hands on it before the end of the year.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
There's a lot I still haven't played.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
This has been a great year for games. It really has.

51:08.000 --> 51:14.000
Thankfully, as far as releases go, aside from Mario Kart 7,

51:14.000 --> 51:20.000
there's no real big major releases in games until the end of January.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
So you got a few weeks to catch up on some stuff, at least.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
SalaciousPop in our chat room says,

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
Sunshine was pretty terrible, to be honest, but I also hated 64.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
I didn't see his thoughts on this one, but I can tell you, since we're playing on the same cartridge,

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
he's been playing quite a bit.

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
He's about as far in the game as I am, so I'm thinking he's liking this one.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
So I'm hearing there's a lot of stuff.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
I don't want to spoil things more than I probably already have,

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
but I hear there's a lot of stuff you can kind of unlock if you do really well on a lot of the levels,

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
and I think that's great. It kind of gives the game some value.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
And obviously, there's the coins that you can go back and get and so forth.

51:58.000 --> 52:06.000
But I get the sense that unlike 64, where you had to play the same level over and over to get the stars and all that,

52:06.000 --> 52:13.000
if you don't get a single coin in the damn game, I think you can still beat it.

52:13.000 --> 52:19.000
I think you can still fight Bowser and beat the game, but you will miss ten bonus levels.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
You'll miss the chance to unlock the extra game.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
I think there's a lot to build for.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
Anyhow, yeah, good gaming week.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
And I still have to play more Skyrim, I really do.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
And after the Civilization sale on Steam the other day, I was like,

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
we need to have another Civ night.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
So anyway, it's a great time to be a gamer. It really is.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
Well, I have one more little thing.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
Sure. What do you want to throw out there before we get into some gaming news?

52:51.000 --> 52:57.000
Well, when you were talking about Umlaut, I forgot to mention that I designed the badges and tickets this year.

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
So everyone needs to go and hold on to my work forever.

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
So your graphic design chatter on this show is not for naught,

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
because now your stuff is actually going to be a part of this gaming event. That's really cool.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
And no, you don't get to preview everyone. I can't show anybody.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Yeah, you have to go to the event and find out.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Rob's seen it though.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
Well, I can't say anything about it. Go to the show and find out.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
You can tell them it looks good.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
Yes, it looks very professional. It does. It looks very professional.

53:26.000 --> 53:33.000
I don't know how much I can and can't say on air, but I will just say,

53:33.000 --> 53:39.000
understanding the source material, you did a really good job making everything consistent.

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
And kind of putting your own spin on it. So I think that's awesome.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
That was the goal. Branding was the big thing.

53:46.000 --> 53:53.000
It was actually really fun to do. Probably one of the fastest I've ever gotten anything accomplished.

53:53.000 --> 54:03.000
But yeah, so for people who actually can't make it, they'll be up on my portfolio after the event's over.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
I'm supposed to be doing something as well, but I don't think I'm at liberty to say yet.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
I haven't seen – once the official word is out there, I'll be able to say something.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
So that's all I can say. But I really hope you're going this year.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Everyone be there.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you really should go to them loud.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Fly out.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Join us.

54:22.000 --> 54:28.000
All right. Quick housekeeping. Follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
And hey, we're now on Google+.

54:33.000 --> 54:38.000
That happened, the show we weren't at last week, but we are now on Google+, as well.

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
Unfortunately, Google did not smarten up and let you have a custom URL,

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
but it's really easy to find us on there just in your little Google Plus search box.

54:45.000 --> 54:51.000
Look for Orange Lounge Radio, and it'll probably pop up by the time you get Orange and L in there.

54:51.000 --> 54:56.000
So keep an eye out for that and plus one S and all that stuff on Google+.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
All right. Let's get into some gaming news.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
We're like, what, an hour into the show with all the games that we played this week?

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Let's actually get into some gaming news.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
It's actually a good thing we spent an hour talking about gaming weeks

55:04.000 --> 55:09.000
because our show is a little bit abbreviated this week because of the website problems.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
We don't have quite as much news as usual.

55:11.000 --> 55:17.000
And it is also a slow news week because it's been a big holiday here in the States.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
There's a few big stories we're going to get to here.

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
I will say also though, look forward to this, in Part B tonight,

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
listless returns in Part B tonight.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
We love to fill slow news weeks with OLR games.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
So listless coming up tonight in Part B. Okay, sorry, Loki, your turn.

55:32.000 --> 55:38.000
Okay. So Sony is reporting that the PlayStation Move has shipped 9 million units,

55:38.000 --> 55:43.000
and a million of those have been over the past half year.

55:43.000 --> 55:48.000
Of course, there's a lot of funky math when you go to look at this.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
One, it's unit shipped, not necessarily sold.

55:51.000 --> 55:57.000
And two, unlike you can't compare this to the Kinect, where Kinect is a solid unit

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
and that's all you need to use the Kinect, the Move has multiple components.

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
So you can have up to four Move controllers per system.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
And I'm not even sure if they're counting the navigation controllers

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
or whatever else to go along with that.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
So who knows what that necessarily means?

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
9 million Move units shipped, I don't know.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
But hey, it's not bad.

56:22.000 --> 56:30.000
I mean, 9 million is a good number, even if it is four per system.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
All right.

56:31.000 --> 56:36.000
I mean, I don't know. It's just doing better than I thought it was.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Not bad.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
Ours is hooked up now. I haven't played it yet.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
I still have the Move controllers, but I actually have no Move.

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
Well, aside from LittleBigPlanet 2 obviously supports it,

56:48.000 --> 56:53.000
but I don't have any Move required games yet.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
But I don't really play my PlayStation 3 that much either.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
That's why I loan out all my PlayStation 3 games.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
That's funny because I've been buying most of my stuff on PS3 lately,

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
and a lot of it comes down to the controller.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
It really does.

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
But if it's online, with the exception of White Knight Chronicles,

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
which is only a Sony game, if it's online, I usually go for Xbox.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
If I play multiplayer, it's live.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
Well, you know what I'm going to be playing a lot of in the next few days?

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Sega Saturn!

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
Why?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Christmas nights.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
Oh, that's right. I forgot. That's like your yearly little thing.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Your fun thing.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
All right.

57:30.000 --> 57:36.000
Well, as far as the Move goes, though, do you think the Move is a wash at this point,

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
or do you think they're still going to try and breathe some life into it?

57:40.000 --> 57:47.000
I think that there's still plenty of life to be brought into it,

57:47.000 --> 57:54.000
because after all, they support it in most of their first-party games.

57:54.000 --> 58:00.000
Like Resistance and Killzone and SOCOM all support the Move,

58:00.000 --> 58:07.000
and plus they have a lot of games coming out that are going to be supporting it that are pretty big.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
Like Bioshock Infinite is going to be supporting the Move.

58:10.000 --> 58:18.000
So I think that they do have a good grasp on how to use the Move with hardcore games, per se.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Better than the Kinect, that's for sure.

58:20.000 --> 58:27.000
I'll give Sony props for that, because the way that they've done Kinect support for the hardcore games,

58:27.000 --> 58:32.000
if you will, like Halo and Forza 4, it sucks.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
It's terrible.

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
I mean, head tracking sounds like a good idea.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Not implemented very well at all.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
And voice commands in Halo, no.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
It's stupid.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
It's absolutely terrible.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
Do you think it's because the Kinect didn't end up being, hardware-wise, what it should have been?

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Like it should have been a better camera in there?

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
I don't even know if that's the case.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
I mean, really, if that is the problem, couldn't they revise the hardware?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Well, I guess they could separate the user base.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
Wait for the next Xbox at this point.

59:00.000 --> 59:06.000
But, I mean, I don't know. I guess it could have been better, but...

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Alright.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
Well, moving on to another story.

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
This was something that had a lot of chatter going on, especially the week that we were off last week,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
but it's kind of been continuing on this week.

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
And that's about this new act that's in Congress, and it's called SOPA.

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
Not soap. SOPA, which is S-O-P-A, it's short for Stop Online Piracy Act.

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
Now, I'm sure most of you in the gaming community have probably heard about this act already.

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
If you're not aware, basically there is an act that's being explored.

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
It hasn't passed yet, but it's one of those things that's going through the committees,

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
which means it likely could go for a vote, you know, even before, possibly,

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
Congress takes a break for the holidays coming up in December.

59:45.000 --> 59:52.000
And, in short, the Stop Online Piracy Act will allow the government to force internet service providers

59:52.000 --> 01:00:00.000
to basically blacklist websites, make it unable to access websites, domain names,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
based on the fact if they are offering infringing material or not.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
You know, what they're trying to stop is they basically want to shut down things like the Pirate Bay.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Like, that'll be one of the first things that gets thrown up there is that they'll block that domain

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:21.000
so that you can no longer pirate, if you've been using that site, you know, videos and movies and so forth and so on.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:29.000
But this is causing a lot of controversy, and the fact is it's kind of like how they are censoring things.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And, well, A, a lot of people are saying straight up when you talk censorship of the internet,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
it's like, dude, this isn't China. Why are we censoring the internet?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Blocking websites, that's a China thing. That's what they do there. Why are we doing this?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And, you know, obviously what they're trying to do is stop piracy,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
but unfortunately, you know, this act, I feel, kind of leaves it very vague,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:00.000
because my understanding is that if a company were to complain that this website is offering infringing material,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
that website could just get shut down. Oh, hold on a minute.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
We have something here in this country called Due Process.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Well, actually, I believe they do. It's not as simple as, you know, they complain about it.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It does actually have to go in front of a judge to say, okay, here's our evidence that this site's doing that.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:26.000
But it's not just sites that have pirated material. It's sites that they claim facilitate finding that.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
So, like, Google, for example.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Pfizer's behind this because it's also targeting websites that sell, like, fake Viagra.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Pfizer's the drug company that created Viagra.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And, you know, how much spam mail do we get every day about go to this Canadian pharmacy website that sells Viagra or whatever it is?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Yeah, but we're still going to get that spam. I mean, that's not going to go away.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Oh, God, if it was going to get rid of the spam, that would be awesome, but no.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.000
There's a couple ways. Oh, and why? I didn't even really get to the story. I was giving the background on this.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
A lot of gaming companies have come out actually in support of this.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Like, Nintendo's in support of it. I believe Microsoft finally came out.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
At first they weren't. Now they are. Sony's in support of it. A lot of the game companies.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Hollywood loves it. Hollywood wants this.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Hollywood's the one, yeah, trying to push this through.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Hollywood's trying to push it through.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Somebody finally came out this week against it.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And it's, like, of course the EFF's against it and all that, but it's the Business Software Alliance, the BSA, came out against this.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Even though originally they commended the idea, the BSA, or the Business Software Alliance, the CEO of them,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Robert Holliman, put in a blog post that they do not support the bill as it is because SOPA needs to, quote,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:46.000
balance key innovation, privacy, and security considerations with the need to thwart the threat rogue websites pose.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Also, quote, definitions of who can be the subject of legal actions and what remedies are imposed must be tightened and narrowed.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Due process, free speech, and privacy are rights cannot be compromised.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
BSA has long stood against filtering or monitoring the internet.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And I totally agree with this guy, is that I understand if they want to do something about piracy and the fake drugs,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
everything that spam targets, I'm all for you trying to clean that shit up off the internet.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:27.000
But where do you draw the line? You know, because filtering the internet, that's not what we do here.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000
You know what I mean? Like, I'm really torn, because whereas I'm like, okay, if they want to stop piracy, they have a right to stop piracy.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Well, they can't really stop piracy. What they're doing is just blocking access to these sites,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
because these sites operate in countries that don't have the same piracy laws as we do.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:48.000
So really, as far as jurisdiction goes in the US, there's nothing they can do about it other than block them. That's it.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And what's great about this act, and you can obviously tell that the person that drafted this really knows their internet,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000
it only blocks domain names. You know what domain names are, right? They're just basically easy ways for you to remember an IP address.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:13.000
It's your cell phone book. Like, seriously, in this day and age, how many people actually have all the numbers in their cell phone book memorized?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Very few. You might know your parents, you might know your significant other, but that's about it.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I don't know my significant other's phone number. I don't.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
And here's the thing, though.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
That's okay, I don't know your significant phone number either.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
It's in my phone.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Okay, there's a bunch of things that they're assuming to be true. First off, these websites or whatever,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.000
obviously if they feel that they're going to be threatened or taken down or whatever, they're just going to give you the IP address.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
You type in the IP address, boom, you're at the website. It's not blocked.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Two, they're assuming that you're using the DNS server that's provided to you by your internet provider.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000
But guess what? You can also forward that to a different DNS server that can be run by anybody, even yourself.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I think at the end of the day, you have to hold these websites responsible and that's the only way to stop the problem.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
It's not that easy because they're not all in America.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Here's the problem, though. Much like piracy and stuff, they're going to try all these things to try to stop piracy,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000
but all it's going to do is hurt other people and not necessarily get rid of the piracy problem.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000
The problem is just like everything else with piracy, just like we've seen time and time again,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
every time they've tried to do something such as, let's say, Ubisoft DRM, right?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
You're not connected to the internet, the game shuts down. Pirates had it cracked in two days.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Who did that shit ultimately hurt? The legitimate users.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And that's going to be the problem with SOPA, is that the pirates will find their way around it in two days.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Who's going to ultimately get hurt? The legitimate users who are trying to access a website like AllGames.com

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
who suddenly got yanked because, I don't know, fucking Namco or somebody didn't like

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000
that they were playing the music from a 25-year-old video game or something, you know?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Like, legitimate people are going to end up getting hurt. That's the problem.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And if it's anything like, you know, I've read kind of these horror stories about some file sharing sites

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.000
where Warner Brothers, they were sending cease and desist basically for files that weren't even their properties.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:19.000
It just happened to have, like, names of their stuff. Part of the title was sharing their names.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I called my hard drive Batman, so Warner Brothers wants to shut me down.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
You know, something like that. Or like, you know, even like YouTube.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Well, YouTube videos now, I mean, obviously, they can pull it if there's a complaint or something like that.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000
But it's just going to be really hard for them to do it, and I just have a feeling that even if this law passes,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I don't think it's going to do anything. Did those, like, what was it? The digital...

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I don't even remember what the hell is.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
The millennium... Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Yeah, basically the DVD copying thing. Did that stop people from copying DVDs?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Nope. Nothing. So people find a way around it, and it's just, it's unfortunate.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
If you don't like the direction these folks are heading in, it's time to vote them out.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Because, you know, I admit, I'm sitting here going, I understand where this might be an issue or whatever,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
but I can think of a lot of things that are a bigger issue right now, and that is like, you know,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I don't know, the fact that the whole country is going down the shitter, and people are very upset about that.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
You know, the whole thing. And I get the...

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Watch out, Rob, you might get pepper sprayed, and then locked into a detainment camp.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
We do live just down the street from UC Davis, you know. Not literally down the street,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
but we're not that far away, all things considered.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
You know, we used to joke on the... Isn't it a long-running joke on this show?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
The People's Republic of Davis, abandon all hope, you enter here, and look at what fucking happened!

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:50.000
And you all can see it. But anyway, anyway, outside of that joke, yeah, obviously,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I do get the element, though, that Hollywood is pissed because piracy is hurting their industry.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Because it is.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But I think to an extent, there's two things hurting that industry.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
You could say that piracy is one, but the other thing that's hurting them is their failure to adapt,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
is killing traditional broadcast networks.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Well, their way of adapting is, well, we're just gonna reduce the amount of options that you have.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And actually, the stuff that they're doing on the retail side of things is hurting them.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Like, for example, there's the 28-day windows, which will soon enough be 60-day windows

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
as soon as those contracts are up next year.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:40.000
60-day windows for movies being in Redbox and also on Netflix.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
And also, Warner Brothers started...

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:52.000
All rental customers are not able to get stuff from distribution and stuff until 60 days after the fact.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Including, which is great, one of the first titles to do this, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Just two weeks after that window is up, they're pulling Harry Potter out of circulation.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
All of them. Gone. Out of circulation.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Because you have to buy it now. Because you have to.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Because it's going out of circulation so they can re-release it later on in a special Uber edition or something.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
But the fact that there's not rental options for the...

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I mean, not that there really is rental options because any rental store can go to the store and go buy it.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
But it's limited because, you know...

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And when you can't find it, you're like, shit, I'll just download it.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Yeah. And it's pretty easy to download stuff.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
And unfortunately, those customers would have rented it.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Hey, maybe you might have liked it and went and bought it.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
And still, there may be people that download a really crappy copy and they're like,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
hey, you know what, that movie's pretty good. I'm gonna go buy it.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
But it just kind of leaves a sour taste in people's mouths.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Especially with all the fucking tons of re-releases or remakes or movies based on board games or stupid shit that we don't...

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Who's had an original idea in the last 50 years?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Yeah, there's not a lot of original ideas out there.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Lots of chatter in our chat room about this tonight.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Again, it's Channel Orange Lounge on the Game Surge Network.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Let me read a few comments here.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Game Guru says, I think everyone needs to be voted out, start from scratch.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Frisbee says, Hollywood is irrelevant to entertainment anymore.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Very interesting quote.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Very interesting and very true, I think, in many ways because the whole...

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Well, look at what we're doing here.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
We're doing a radio program.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
We're doing a podcast that people can listen to in their car without having to ever turn on the radio.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
What about web shows like The Guild, for example?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Or viral videos, you know?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
People at this point would rather watch...

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:54.000
They would rather watch cute kitty laughing and giggling videos or the dog that sounds like he's really saying, I love you, than watching Whitney.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
There's a lot more...

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Oh, God. That show is terrible.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:05.000
There's a lot more entertainment options out there than there were, say, 30 years ago, whatever.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Before when it was just like, okay, you've got radio, you've got movies, and you have TV.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
That's it.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
You can read a newspaper or a funny book or something like that, but now it's just the internet.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
The internet's just got tons of content.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Anything you're looking for, it's just right there.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.000
That's why these TV shows, if it's a very mediocre TV show, no one gives a fuck.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
No one's going to watch that.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Like Whitney, it was terrible.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
It just happens to come on sometimes after the office is done.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I'm like, ah! Horrible show! Off with you!

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I just want to sort of, I guess, kind of reign things back.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Everyone pay attention who you vote for.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Don't vote a party ticket, because that's also just as dangerous.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Because that's how assholes get snuck into government positions.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Stop and take an effort to read who supports what.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Get a take home ballot, or an absentee ballot, that's how I vote every year.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Do your homework!

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Exactly.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
And then double check every box that you mark right before you mark it.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That's the advantage of taking one of those home.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
You have time to research, you list out the pros and cons,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
but the biggest thing is actually put some damn effort into your future.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I mean, how many people do you know just don't vote because, oh, I don't care?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Or, oh, it's too much work for me to go and mark some check boxes or read up on this stuff.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Oh, it's too much work.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Or, I'm going to buy this product because it's cheap and I don't care if they outsource all of their customer service.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
You know, that's why it's cheap.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Think about what you do before you fucking do it.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And put effort into your life.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Well, did Dan just laugh from the other room?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Yeah, because he's mad at me because I don't have a job yet.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
You're expressing yourself in other ways.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I'd like to express myself at a job. Someone hire me too while you're at it.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Well, you did get, I mean, you might not be getting paid for it,

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
but you at least have the fuzzy wuzzy, I contributed to a good cause.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Addendum. I want a job that will pay me too.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
But you don't mind the charity work at all either.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I don't mind the charity work, but you don't know how many.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Uh oh.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000
You're stealing my shit list for the Warcraft thing.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I'm getting yelled at by Dan.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:39.000
And if somebody out there could donate self-defense classes, I'd really appreciate that.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
No, that's really besides the point.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
It's when you've got it on a mass scale, that's when we see a problem.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
It's one little action done by thousands of people can make a difference.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
You know, if you really want to make a point for Dan, you know what job you should get?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
You should run for Congress.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Fuck no.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Dan says, hell yeah, then we could be corrupt and rich.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
No. No.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Awesome. There you go, Dan.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I am not going to live a life that I find morally objectionable.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I bet you could get like 10 votes from OLR listeners.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
All right.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Moving on.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
All right.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
In all seriousness.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Can I do my story now?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Yes, you may do your story now.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
We need fuzzy wuzzy happy news.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
How about indie game music bundle?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Yay.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
10 albums for a dollar.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:45.000
The, um, there's now the indie game music bundle, which is like the humble indie bundle,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:53.000
but you get 10 items for a dollar, um, including, um, stuff from Super Meat Boy and VVVVVVV Minecraft.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Um, that's, uh, Minecraft Volume Alpha, uh, Cobalt EP, Super Meat Boy Digital Special Edition Soundtrack,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Imposter Nostalgia, Raven Mark Scourge of Astellion, Ares Extinction Agenda, Return All Robots,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Mighty Milky Way, Mighty Flip Channel, uh, Champ, sorry.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
PPPPPPP, the VVVVVVV, OST, and Tree of Knowledge.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
You said PP.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:25.000
And, um, if you can, uh, contribute more than $10, you also get Wind Up Night, Binding of Isaac, 72 Minutes of Fame,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Milk Snake, Anti-Gravity Extreme Road Trip, and Contingency.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Okay, seriously?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:39.000
For just the Super Meat Boy and VVVVV or what, PPVVVV, whatever soundtracks, is like worth that whole dollar like 20 times over?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
You know how I'd pronounce that?

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Huh.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
PRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR, the VVVVVV, OST.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
So.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
There.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000
But, uh, yeah, seriously, I'm just not as familiar with some of the other soundtracks, but I'm sure there's a lot of great chiptuney stuff in there, so, um,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
You really should think about purchasing this. You really, really should think about that.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
You know, if you have a dollar.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Don't think so hard you give yourself an aneurysm.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Yeah, don't do that.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
All right.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
But if you do, I'll kinda laugh.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Uh, Loki.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.320
All right, so let's see.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.380
Let's start off with some more cheerful stuff, hopefully.

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:21.480
So basically, there may be a sequel to Command & Conquer

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.720
possibly coming from BioWare.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:26.240
It was teased during a,

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:32.680
they actually had a real brief video on teasing, I guess.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.760
There's a Spike Video Games Awards

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.640
right around the corner.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.520
And then, of course, there's also a screenshot

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:43.240
that's out there as well, and kind of,

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.840
it's a new BioWare game,

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.600
and they haven't really said what exactly it is,

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.800
but it looks kinda neat.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.720
Also, there's another studio that's part of the EA,

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.040
I don't know, the ARM, if you will, Victory Games.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.120
They're working on a new strategy title,

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.940
which people are thinking, hmm, maybe that's a cool,

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:06.940
Command & Conquer game, hmm, perhaps.

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:11.320
Also, I guess they have another Medal of Honor thing

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.200
working with one of their other studios, Danger Close.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.200
So lots of different studios working under EA.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.520
Remember, at one point, EA was just buying up,

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.280
not necessarily buying up everybody,

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.520
but publishing everybody.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:32.520
They have, obviously, the new Respawn Entertainment

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:37.480
from the former execs of Infinity Ward.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:38.640
You know, they're making something.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.620
Obviously, Valve is doing a lot of stuff with them.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.000
And then, Crytek as well.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.600
Lots of stuff there.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.720
But at least the BioWare game,

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.520
now, of course, right now, they don't know if it,

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:55.600
you know, Command & Conquer is really the game or not,

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.740
or if it's something else.

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:59.940
But the BioWare game is gonna be revealed December 10th

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:01.720
during the Spike Video Game Awards,

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:06.340
and like I said, they had a very, very, very brief trailer

01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:08.000
of something with tanks.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.360
It has tanks in it.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.720
How do you feel about Command & Conquer

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:11.780
with Dialogue Trees?

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.280
Weren't you a big fan of Command & Conquer?

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.560
I soon remember this.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.980
I used to be, Red Alert.

01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.360
Red Alert was awesome.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.800
But I haven't played Command & Conquer in a long time.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.140
In fact, the last one that came out,

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:25.640
I just didn't really care for.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.980
Well, it could be good, though,

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:30.800
if they turned it over to a new studio

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.920
to kind of give it a creative energy reboot,

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.160
that could be a good thing, right?

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.000
Yeah, and I'm not even sure.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.760
I mean, there's a lot of studios working on stuff.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.400
It could be BioWare that's doing it.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.640
I think BioWare's actually gonna be

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.460
a different game altogether.

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.300
The thought is, though,

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:46.380
that Victory Games is gonna be doing this,

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:49.480
but I have no idea who the hell Victory Games is.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.120
So, I guess they're a new strategy studio.

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:56.240
And, you know, strategy games for EA,

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.280
I mean, really, there was the Lord of the Rings games

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.920
that they had and Command & Conquer.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.040
So, since Lord of the Rings is not part of EA anymore,

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.220
I'm gonna go on a limb and say

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:11.500
probably gonna be a Command & Conquer game at some point.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.720
Or maybe, hey, a new IP, maybe a new IP.

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:14.920
You never know, that could be two.

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:15.740
That'd be good.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.120
All right, well, let's move on to another story.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.840
And this is about a possible answer to Smash Brothers

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.420
that Sony is making.

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.920
Now, I should say this.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.420
I always thought that move game,

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:28.800
what was that called, Move Fighters?

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.260
Or something fighters?

01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:31.220
The one that was on Sony?

01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:32.600
I thought that was supposed to be their answer

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.840
to Smash Brothers, but I guess not really.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.680
What, which one?

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.280
What the hell's that game that's on Sony move?

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.280
Is it Pocket Fighters?

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.700
No, nothing else.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.960
I think you're thinking of, like,

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.320
there is a Kung Fu game that was on there.

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.160
Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.600
Somebody in chow yell it out.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.720
I don't remember the original game,

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.880
but the one that they have coming to Kinect,

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.400
that's exactly the same as Kung Fu High Impact.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.940
No, no, I'm not thinking of that, something else.

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.000
But anyway, it's fine.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.040
There apparently is something a little more,

01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.960
I don't know if you wanna say mainstream or what,

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.280
but I guess something that's a little more directly,

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.120
I don't wanna say either a Smash Brothers ripoff,

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.500
but something that's supposedly in development.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.440
There's a lot of stuff that's leaking through this blog

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.360
called paulgalenetwork.com.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.400
I'm not sure this gentleman's relation

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.020
to the gaming industry,

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.760
but a lot of the other gaming blogs

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.080
have picked up and ran with this,

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.560
where Title Fight is apparently the development

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.700
work in progress name of this.

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:28.840
And some information that's in this,

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:32.080
it is very similar to Super Smash Brothers.

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:34.440
It's the special moves and all those attacks,

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.880
you kinda do the same way.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.940
Apparently there are some characters

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:40.280
already noticed in this,

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:43.180
and they kinda come in light and heavy flavors,

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:46.120
meaning like who moves slowly, who moves lightly.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:50.000
Heavier characters include Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.760
Colonel Male Retic, Fat Princess.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:56.040
Some of the lighter characters include Parappa the Rappa,

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.760
that's kinda awesome if he's in a fighting game,

01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:01.720
Kratos, Sly Cooper, and Nathan Drake.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:04.440
Not sure if there's anything about a story mode

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.160
or anything like that at this time,

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.440
but yeah, I guess some information's

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.560
starting to leak out about this,

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.440
that this could be I guess something you might see

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.280
at next year's E3.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:16.240
Well, another interesting thing I heard

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.000
is that there's a commercial right now

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.720
that Sony's running called the Michael Commercial.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.720
Have you seen this?

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.480
It's floating around where it's like,

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.120
you know, we need Michael, we need Michael,

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.880
and it's like all these Sony characters

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.360
as real life people acting,

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.120
it's actually one of the better Sony commercials in a while,

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:34.840
but it's all these people as real life Sony characters,

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:37.240
we need Michael, and Michael is the player

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.680
who takes down the controller,

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:42.000
and it's all like be a part of the game or whatever.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.560
And some people are saying maybe this is teasing

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:49.440
this whole Sony smorgasbord of characters, this project.

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.360
Cause I could certainly see this as being the big Sony

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:55.880
reveal of next year's E3,

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:59.200
because now that the Vita will already be out there,

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.800
maybe there's gonna be something about this game

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.560
and how it works between the Vita,

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.160
it could be a Vita title for all we know,

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.560
but how it works between the Vita and the PS3 and all that.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:11.440
So could be neat, right?

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.320
It could be neat.

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:15.000
I love the idea of characters like Parappa the Rappa,

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.880
like I kind of forget about how many characters

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:17.720
Sony really has in their pocket.

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.800
I wonder if he's gonna give you a paper cut.

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.880
He might, it could be something he does,

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:26.880
or Umjama Lamy if she's in it, I'm there, but we'll see.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.960
Milk can, yeah, my guitar is in my mind.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.440
It would be interesting to see too,

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.400
if they were able to get from some of the other developers,

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.720
you know, kind of like how Smash Brothers had Sonic Snake

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.520
and what was it in the commercial?

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.360
Sonic.

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.400
Sonic, hello, was in the game.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.320
It would be interesting to see if Sony could get things

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.120
that were very iconically Sony,

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.880
like Cloud from Final Fantasy 7.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.920
Final Fantasy 7 was a huge Sony thing.

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:54.880
Cause that was when the franchise

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.200
jumped over to PlayStation.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.600
Could be interesting.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.960
Could be very interesting.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.160
All right.

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.360
All right, what are we doing now?

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.880
Moving on to some release dates, right?

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.240
It's traveling around the world

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.120
and check out what's coming out to a store this week.

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:13.240
I imagine it's dying down significantly, but let's see.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:15.320
Yeah, incredibly dying down.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.080
A few things.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.560
There's some cool new combo packs they have

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.280
with controller and game bundles.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.000
They did this kind of last year.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.280
And so Sony's got some of those.

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.240
One of them's Uncharted,

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.000
the dual pack with Uncharted one and two,

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.480
and then you get a dual shot controller.

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.440
I believe it's blue.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.280
And then they have one that's in black

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:40.280
that comes with the Resistance one and two dual pack.

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:43.800
And there's also one with the God of War Origins collection.

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.760
It's, I believe, red.

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.560
Those are all on PlayStation 3.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.320
Let's see here.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.400
Jaws Ultimate Predator on Wii and 3DS.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:59.040
Face Racers Photo Finish on 3DS.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.840
Nano Assault on 3DS.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.520
But really the only 3DS game you should really care about

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.600
is Mario Kart 7.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.400
And that's coming out one week from today.

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.600
That's it.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.320
Oh my God, one week from today?

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:11.560
That's awesome. One week from today.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.080
I can't believe it.

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.120
All right.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.280
Well, let's take a look at Japan and what they're getting.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.480
They're actually getting a little bit more,

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:19.680
and I think a lot of that is because

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.280
they're getting some of the localized versions

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.880
of stuff that already came out for us.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.040
In fact, when you look at the Xbox 360 releases

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.080
on December 1st, it looks a lot like that.

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.920
Assassin's Creed Revelations comes out

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.720
as well as Dragon Age Origins gets a reduction.

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:35.640
It's going into the Platinum Collection on Xbox 360.

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:36.900
Sonic Generations.

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:40.280
Shiro no Jiku is the subtitle for it over there,

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.120
comes out this week,

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.160
as well as King of Fighters XIII makes its way out

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.240
in Japan this week.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.120
Also one other game on the 360 this week,

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:49.320
a game called Ever17 comes out in regular

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.120
and limited edition flavors.

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.000
I'm not sure what this game is all about.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.760
It's an adventure game, but I'm noticing it's, you know,

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.720
anime chicks in school girl outfits.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:01.480
And in this one clip, I kid you not, I'm looking,

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.000
she's holding a hamster and like talking to the hamster.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.200
So I don't know if she's like the hamster whisperer or what,

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.320
but that's Ever17.

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.640
Is that an anime?

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.480
Maybe it's an anime.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.840
No, I don't really watch anime anymore.

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:13.680
Rama's in chat.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:14.960
He'll jump in if that's an anime I'm not aware of.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.040
Actually, I take that back.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.520
I've been watching a whole crap load of Evangelion lately.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.360
Have you really?

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.200
Why that?

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.520
Cause the new series is out, the Rebuild of Evangelion.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:26.060
And I've watched the first part already,

01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:28.200
but I started watching some of the second part

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.920
cause they changed quite a bit of the story.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.080
And then the third one's out.

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:36.080
And so I sat reading the entire Wiki, Evangelion Wiki,

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.600
just like, oh, that's it.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.040
Okay, cool.

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.120
Going to the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan,

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.720
Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus comes out this week,

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.060
as well as the Sonic Generations

01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:46.920
and King of Fighters 13 releases.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:50.100
Also on the Sony system this week, Tekken Hybrid.

01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:51.680
You know, I saw this at Target.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.820
We have a version here in America

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.320
that I think just came out this week.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.960
And I had like, Alan picked it up off the shelf

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.400
and was like, I didn't know that this was coming out.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.520
And I was like, shit, I didn't know about this one either.

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:04.440
But yeah, this is, what the hell?

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.640
It's like Tag Tournament and?

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:08.560
It's Tag Tournament HD.

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:13.480
There's a Tag Tournament 2 preview

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.640
and then also Tekken Bowling,

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.240
but I think that's also part of Tag Tournament.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.880
And it's all in 3D?

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:24.160
Well, no, it's just those games,

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:29.000
plus it's also the Tekken 3D animated movie

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.880
that just came out as a 3D Blu-ray.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:32.700
Got it.

01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:35.860
So Hybrid as far as, is both a movie and both a game.

01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:37.920
So like, you can even take that game

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:39.520
and play it in a regular Blu-ray player

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:42.280
and you can watch the movie in 3D if you want.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:44.680
Or you can just, and what's great though

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.840
is remember the new Tekken game that's coming out in 3DS

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.400
will also have that movie in 3D on it,

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.380
which is pretty cool.

01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:54.140
Gotta hit up my Namco guy.

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.560
All right, just a reminder that the PS Vita

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.720
is three weeks away, December 17th.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.080
So. In Japan.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.360
In Japan, not here,

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.240
but I am doing Japanese releases right now.

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.280
That's true.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.800
Sony PSP this week, since that's still the Sony system.

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:14.880
Only big release is Kamen Rider Climax Heroes 4Z

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:15.720
comes out this week.

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.680
That's from Namco Bando and it's an action related title

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.180
that looks like kind of a 3D-esque robot fighting game,

01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:26.180
kind of like Ultraman style characters

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.160
all fighting in that game.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.120
Lastly, trying to peek ahead to see if the Wii or the,

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.140
that game is coming out on the Wii as well.

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:36.600
Let me look at a 3DS real quick.

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:37.920
Oh, Mario Kart 7.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.760
They get it on December 1st in Japan.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.400
So I'm sure we'll be hearing some early reviews

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:43.840
from people who imported it.

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.620
Also Sonic Generations coming out on December 1st as well.

01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:49.080
Cooking Mama 4 this week on the 3DS.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.640
And lastly, but not leastly,

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.920
get a load of this title.

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:57.920
Crayon Shin-chan Uchu de Achuu Yuzhou no Oba Karate.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.960
Crayon Shin-chan is old school manga and anime.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:04.380
Yeah. So, and it's, I love,

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.800
what was the last part of that?

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.240
I love this.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.520
No, Oba Karate.

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.780
It makes it sound like it's like a karate crayon game.

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:12.120
And it is an action-based game.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.000
And it's based on that old anime.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.720
Kind of like a platformer.

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:16.720
Looks a little bit like, you know,

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.720
your Rayman kind of platformer game.

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.200
So that's it for releases in Japan.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:28.120
For the UK, really not a whole bunch.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:33.120
We have, on the 30th, Darkstalkers for PlayStation 3.

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.840
Which is kind of cool.

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.440
And then on December 1st, there's Infinity Blade 2.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:43.040
December 2nd, Ace Combat, Assault Horizon Legacy,

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.360
Assassin's Creed Revelations for PC,

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.320
Mario Kart 7, and Super Pokemon Rumble.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.160
That's it.

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:52.480
Just a few more stories for you guys,

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:54.360
and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.920
But first, Dark Sakura.

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:59.320
Well, there have been a lot of pre-orders

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.080
for the Vita in Hong Kong.

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.320
Basically, they are the second city

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:09.800
that are getting the system.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:13.220
And, well, there's mobbing in online stores

01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:16.360
that can't, you know, meet the traffic,

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.920
and lots of stuff going on.

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.880
But it's, I guess, not nearly as bad

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.120
as getting pepper sprayed in the face

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.200
over a $2 waffle iron.

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:29.920
But, hey, what this basically means

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.800
is that the early demand is there.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.120
This could be kind of a big deal.

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:34.960
Yarp.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.600
It could very well be.

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.520
And I guess that's really all we can say about it for now.

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.280
I know, I was like,

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:44.200
I haven't had any real reaction out of it,

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.100
just that it's sold.

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:46.260
Maybe people are just too busy

01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.760
hiding under their desk playing it.

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.260
It's interesting to know if the system's gonna do well,

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:53.120
or if it's gonna fall flat, so we'll see.

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.800
All right, well, hopefully.

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.000
All right.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.800
I have high hopes for it.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.600
Seems to be doing pretty well.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.480
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna get one.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:03.660
So, Loki.

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:08.800
So, there's been a lot of talk of piracy this week,

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:12.100
and one person, of course, to speak out about it

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:16.360
is Gabe Newell, the head of Valve.

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:20.080
And basically, one of the things he says

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:22.800
is piracy's almost always a service problem,

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:25.560
and not a pricing problem.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.640
And the way he puts it,

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:31.620
it's we think there's a fundamental misconception

01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:32.460
about piracy.

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:35.560
Piracy is always a service problem, not a pricing problem.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:37.880
For example, if a pirate offers a product

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:40.040
anywhere in the world, 24-7,

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:43.320
purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer,

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.280
and the legal provider says that the product

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:47.660
is region locked, will come to your country

01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:49.640
three months after a US release,

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:52.480
and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store,

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.120
then the pirate service is more valuable.

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.300
Most DRM solutions diminish the value of the product

01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.880
by either directly restricting a customer's use,

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.160
or by creating uncertainty.

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:06.040
So, basically, kind of alluding to Assassin's Creed 2

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:10.880
and the Ubisoft DRM, which we mentioned earlier,

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:15.440
pretty much got destroyed in a few days.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.840
And then, of course, they're saying,

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.940
Steam isn't without its own problems.

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:23.840
Saints Row the Third, you know,

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.980
used, I guess, Steamworks and stuff,

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:28.440
and is unavailable on the UK Steam store

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:31.560
for reasons that THQ are yet to elaborate on.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:34.120
So that kind of sucks that they don't have it yet.

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.800
But, I mean, Steam's not perfect either,

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.300
because their stuff gets pirated just as well.

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.400
I was gonna-

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.040
A lot of people seem to kind of be on board with Steam.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:45.880
Yeah.

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:46.700
Sales help.

01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:48.400
I was gonna elaborate real quick,

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:52.120
because it's not one of the stories that we had earlier,

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:57.120
but some other people were talking piracy,

01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.440
and, funny enough, it's also Ubisoft,

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.520
and their latest game to be coming out,

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:06.960
well, ever delayed game to be coming out, I Am Alive,

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.920
they were saying that, well, we're not gonna put it on PC,

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:15.880
because piracy issues.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:20.880
Basically, the creative director, Stanislaus Metra,

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:24.040
has basically said that PC piracy

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:27.800
makes the financial viability of a game

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.600
on the platform uncertain,

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:33.080
and Ubisoft's previously announced title, I guess,

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.840
is only planned for consoles,

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.440
and, of course, that would be I Am Alive.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:41.440
So we heard loud and clear that PC gamers

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:44.940
are bitching about there being no version for them.

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:46.700
Interesting that they used bitching

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:49.200
in their official statement.

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:53.440
Says, but are these people just making noise

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.960
because there's no version,

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:59.960
or because it's a game they actually want to play?

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.320
Would they buy it if we made it?

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:06.720
And he continued saying that if 50,000 PC players

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:09.620
buy the game, it's not worth the cost

01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:12.680
of putting a team of 12 on the project for three months.

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:17.680
Says it's hard because there's so much piracy

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:20.760
and so few people are playing PC games

01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:24.340
that we have to precisely weigh it up

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:26.280
against the cost of making it.

01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:29.960
Of course, that pissed off everybody, all sorts of people.

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.440
What's great, though, is shortly afterwards,

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:37.760
after everyone completely complained about that,

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:42.760
he backpedaled on that, and he's saying, let's see here,

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.560
honestly, which game maker would not love to see his game

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.840
to be playable on his main platforms

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:54.200
and as by many people as possible?

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.080
I don't know, it's hilarious.

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.560
I hate to say it, but I kind of think dude has a point.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:08.200
I mean, a lot of games do get pirated on PC

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:10.920
and I think it's part of the reason

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:13.600
why developers are getting shy about it.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.200
And for example, Arkham City was hella delayed on PC.

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:20.700
I bet, and even though the company's not very vocal

01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:22.040
about this and for good reason,

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.400
obviously you see all this backlash,

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:27.800
I honestly truly believe a big part of the delay for PC

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:29.800
was so that consoles got the jump

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.440
because it's all about playing it,

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.040
and this goes back to Gabe Newell's point

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:36.240
about convenience and getting it as soon as possible

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:37.680
and the releases and all that.

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:39.480
People wanna play it now.

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.960
And I think because it's on the consoles early,

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.360
I think it really helps.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:46.000
I mean, nothing's ever gonna stop piracy,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.760
but I think it helps turn a lot of people away from it.

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.880
I mean, certainly piracy happens on the consoles too,

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:52.760
but it's a lot harder.

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:57.080
And Ubisoft further digs themselves deeper

01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:01.120
by skipping Ghost Recon Future Soldier on PC as well

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:04.480
because, piracy, they even said,

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.640
they're gonna do Ghost Recon Online,

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.020
and said, when we started Ghost Recon Online,

01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:12.380
we were thinking about Ghost Recon Future Soldier

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:14.520
having something imported in the classic way

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.280
without any deep development

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.640
because we know that 95% of our consumers

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:19.520
will pirate the game.

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.680
So we said, okay, we'll have to change our mind.

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:25.880
Well, that's very positive that your game,

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:28.280
you feel it's just gonna be pirated like crazy.

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:33.280
And they're basically saying that there's no,

01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:35.520
we're giving away most of the content for free

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.580
because there's no barrier to entry.

01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:40.920
And this is talking about Ghost Recon Online.

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:43.820
And it says, to the users that are traditionally

01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:47.540
playing the game by getting it through Pirate Bay,

01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:49.920
we said, okay, go ahead, guys.

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.080
This is what you're asking for.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:53.280
We've listened to you.

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.700
We're gonna give you this experience.

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:55.700
It's easy to download.

01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:58.260
There's no DRM that will pollute your experience.

01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.500
So basically, they're like,

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:00.900
well, there's nothing we can do,

01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:01.740
so we're just gonna stop.

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:03.540
So we've designed a free-to-play game.

01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:04.620
Yeah.

01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:05.820
Interesting tactic.

01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:09.440
You know, as much as I think people wanna hate this guy,

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:13.560
I think it's somewhat of a fair response.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.260
I really do.

01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:16.100
Yeah.

01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:18.820
I mean, that is, but I am sorry.

01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:20.380
I am alive, though.

01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:22.720
First off, it's running and older.

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:24.260
It's not like they have to create the engine

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:25.180
totally from scratch.

01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:27.180
It's the Splinter Cell Conviction Engine.

01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:29.660
But, and it's also a game that's been delayed

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:30.620
and delayed and delayed,

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:32.340
and I don't think it's a game that really

01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:35.600
a lot of people are like, oh my God, I gotta play this.

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.800
I think they're just pissed off that they're saying,

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.140
oh, well, no one plays PC games.

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:43.020
I think there's a lot of people who disagree with you.

01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:44.440
All right, I'm going to our chat room

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.820
for some comments on some various stories

01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:46.660
we've been talking about,

01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:47.980
because obviously, we are the show

01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:49.740
where every gamer has a voice.

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:50.580
Usually our...

01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:51.400
Except everyone.

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.620
Usually our chat room is at chat.orangelandraday.com,

01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:55.100
but due to website issues tonight,

01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:56.720
we are giving you the long way of getting there,

01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:59.100
which is going on to IRC, the Game Surge Network,

01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:00.720
and we are at Channel Orange Lounge.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.740
Or you know what, for real,

01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:02.780
if you really don't know how to get there,

01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:05.620
just go to chat.allgames.com and ask them,

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:06.700
how do I join Orange Lounge?

01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:07.520
They'll tell you.

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.980
They're nice.

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:09.800
Especially tonight.

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.060
I told them, I said, please be nice,

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.680
because we don't have a website.

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.200
Anyhow, just some clarifications.

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.580
Ever17.

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:16.420
Rama figured it out.

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:17.540
It's not an anime.

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:20.420
It's a visual novel that's now been adapted to a game.

01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:22.660
So that's what Ever17 is.

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:23.580
Let's see.

01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:26.860
Kajudo is talking about the Vita in Hong Kong,

01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:29.420
saying they're buying the Vita in Hong Kong

01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:30.700
so they can resell it.

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:32.420
That's the only reason.

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:34.780
Interesting perspective, because you might say,

01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:35.700
oh no, that can't be it,

01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.940
but that kind of shit happens in America, too.

01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.660
Like, you know, when the Wiis first came out,

01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:41.180
and hell, the Xboxes.

01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:42.740
Remember when people were buying up

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:44.540
the limited Xbox supplies

01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.500
and then reselling them for twice as much?

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:48.760
This shit happens with new tech all the time.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.220
So I could believe that.

01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:53.140
I can actually really believe that.

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:53.980
So we'll see.

01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:56.280
I guess that isn't necessarily an indicator

01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.700
of how strong something's gonna sell,

01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:00.300
because people tried to do that with the 3DS,

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.020
and it didn't work so well for them.

01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:03.340
I don't think they made money on that.

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:05.580
So there you go.

01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:08.720
Kajudo in chat says there is only one way to stop piracy,

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.080
make everything free.

01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:12.940
Yes, Kajudo, I need you to make me a sandwich,

01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:14.980
and don't you expect me to pay you for it?

01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:17.100
Just teasing.

01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:20.760
But he does go on to say it will never happen.

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.600
Piracy will never,

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:23.580
it will never happen.

01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:26.340
No one will, nowhere will piracy ever stop.

01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:30.560
So please stop torturing us with your shitty attempts at DRM.

01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:34.700
All right.

01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:35.660
Let's move on.

01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:39.440
Let's move on with one more story from me.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:41.140
Then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:42.620
This is something we found

01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:44.100
when we tried to put together tonight's show

01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:45.360
without a website.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.760
We found this one quickly.

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.700
It was something we found on Dig,

01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:53.920
and it's a blog post from a website,

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:55.780
damnlag.com,

01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:58.260
and it's an article about game developers,

01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:01.460
you need to take your demos more seriously.

01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:03.480
And of course, now that I'm trying to bring it up in studio,

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.320
it's not loading,

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:07.860
the joys of live radio and internet timeouts.

01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:11.300
I did read the article a little bit before the show.

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:14.300
I think an ad is trying to prevent this thing

01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:16.620
from popping up all the way or something.

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.020
Yeah, the internet's working.

01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:20.820
Yeah, I know, no, the internet's working fine.

01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:21.740
Amazing.

01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:24.340
Damn people.

01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:29.580
So apparently this demo,

01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.900
he's talking about the Rayman Origins demo

01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:34.140
had recently, I was working for you, fantastic.

01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:35.740
It's not coming up on the computer over there.

01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:36.580
All right.

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:39.260
So it's talking about how the Rayman Origins demo

01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:40.500
was really good,

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:44.620
and the author of the article at damnlag.com

01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:46.340
was talking about how he's played through the demo

01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:49.300
several times and how it's just a great game.

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:52.100
It kind of has elements of New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:55.260
and mixing with the original Rayman and so forth.

01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:57.860
Saying that, I didn't really know about this game before.

01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:00.160
Sure, I heard a little bit about it at E3,

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.580
but I'm kind of throwing this in there.

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:05.260
Let's face it, it's a really crowded time of year.

01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:06.780
There's a lot of video games out right now.

01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:09.100
It's really kind of hard to get the attention.

01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:10.540
And the article talks about how developers

01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:12.900
usually think of demos as an afterthought,

01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:16.420
that if they even bother to put one out at all.

01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:19.540
And then talks about, the article goes on to talk about

01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:24.540
how if you can get a customer to really experience the game

01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:27.880
or even a demo that's mid-game,

01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:29.300
citing like Heavenly Sword,

01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:30.340
something that kind of takes

01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:31.380
not just the beginning of the game,

01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:34.060
but something that's a little bit in the middle of the game,

01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:35.140
that's a really good demo.

01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:38.700
And then some companies actually do levels

01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:40.740
that are just for demos.

01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:45.740
Like DMA Design actually did something in the 90s

01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:47.620
where they did Lemmings demos

01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:50.700
that were like Christmas-themed levels, but free.

01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:53.220
So whatever happened to a good old-fashioned demo?

01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:55.100
Because a lot of games don't even bother with them.

01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:57.060
PEGL Extreme, I mean, if you want to look at that,

01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:00.660
that came out with all of the Valve branding on it.

01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:02.940
But it was, in essence, a free demo,

01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:05.500
because it says, hey, if you really liked playing this,

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:09.780
and you get, I think like 10 levels or so of PEGL,

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:11.500
it says, hey, if you like this,

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.760
try out the real thing, here you go.

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.420
So PopCap did it.

01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:21.200
Well, the reason why I wanted to talk about this story

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:22.780
a little bit is I kind of wanted to ask you guys,

01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:24.820
how important is a demo for you guys

01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:27.140
in influencing your game buying decisions?

01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:29.200
I mean, do you like to use reviews?

01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.540
Do you just kind of jump in if it's cheap?

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:33.820
Do you use game demos or what?

01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:37.980
I'll kind of answer this, is that I do like game demos.

01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:40.660
I don't think they're necessarily the most important thing

01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:42.860
in selling a game, because I think,

01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:44.580
especially now that we live in a day and age

01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:49.280
where we have Gamefly and hell, even now streaming games,

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.100
thanks to OnLive and so forth,

01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:53.620
OnLive especially is interesting,

01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:55.420
because now your demo can just be,

01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:57.300
oh, play an hour of it for free,

01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:58.520
or something like what Steam did

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.060
over the weekend with Magica.

01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:03.580
So I think there's a lot of that evolving,

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:06.380
but I'm not gonna lie, a really good demo

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:08.620
can absolutely sell a game, absolutely,

01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:11.220
because it leaves you wanting more, you know?

01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:14.380
Well, on top of that, you also get an idea of edits

01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:16.660
that they've made in games too,

01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:18.520
because a lot of times a demo's not gonna have

01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:21.040
all the edits that make it into the final game.

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.380
And if you are clever and can get into the information

01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:28.380
on the disk, you can get more out of it, you know?

01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:31.260
But I mean, we've got a pile of PlayStation Magazine demos

01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:32.580
in Devault.

01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:34.620
Oh yeah, those PlayStation demos are always the bomb.

01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:35.460
Those are great.

01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:37.260
I've played so much Jumping Flash.

01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:40.300
From the demo disk that came

01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:42.720
with my friend's ex-boyfriend's PlayStation.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:44.860
Well, how many people bought, what was it,

01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:46.720
like Brave Fencer Mushashi or whatever,

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:48.620
just because it came with the Final Fantasy VIII demo?

01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:49.460
Yes.

01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:53.820
Or there was, what game got the Final Fantasy VII demo?

01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:54.700
Can't remember.

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.260
Toe Ball.

01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:58.180
Toe Ball.

01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.020
Yeah.

01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:00.340
Yeah, and that sold a lot just because of the demo too.

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.880
But Toe Ball actually wasn't a bad game.

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.720
Yeah, yeah, no, I know, but there's a lot of people.

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:04.980
Really wish they'd make a new Toe Ball.

01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:05.860
They did a second one.

01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:07.540
Well, I know they did a second one, it was awesome,

01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:11.360
but I really wish they'd make a new Toe Ball.

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.000
Going to the chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com,

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.020
Act Def says, I usually ask people.

01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:19.340
JV Mon says, I use demos for franchises

01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:20.260
I'm not familiar with.

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:21.540
If it wasn't for demos,

01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:25.340
I would never have bought Blue Dragon or Cold Seps Saga.

01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:27.060
Cold Seps Saga is awesome.

01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:28.580
Cold Seps Saga is an interesting one

01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:30.220
because I didn't play the demo for that,

01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:32.260
but a friend of mine got me into that

01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:33.460
and was like, this is the best game ever

01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:34.420
and nobody's ever heard of it.

01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:35.260
And it's true.

01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:36.660
Like I've never heard anything about that game,

01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:39.420
but it's like fricking Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.

01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:41.220
It was actually kind of awesome.

01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:43.880
Kaijuto says, demo made me buy Just Cause 2.

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.200
I love that game.

01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:49.640
Hitstun goes so far as to make a little graph here.

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.500
My usual considerations when buying games.

01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:55.460
Friends playing, greater than reviews,

01:43:55.460 --> 01:44:00.000
greater than price, greater than hype, greater than demo.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.960
So kind of putting demo towards the end of the chain there.

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:05.220
See, I honestly,

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:08.500
because my friends have kind of different tastes

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:09.880
all across the board.

01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:11.780
So one person may like something

01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:14.060
and I've turned out to completely hate it.

01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:16.100
I mean, because it's just how it is.

01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:19.180
I don't believe in making a judgment

01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:22.800
until I've played some of it, you know, or seen it played.

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:27.620
So demos and, you know, online videos of a game

01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:31.140
really do more for me

01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:33.440
than relying on another person's opinion,

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.300
if that makes sense.

01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:37.260
Not that I disrespect my friends' opinions,

01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:39.220
but it's just, honestly,

01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.740
there's games that a lot of people love

01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:43.140
that I'm like, what the hell?

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:44.740
Like, to be perfectly honest,

01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:46.960
I'm kind of not all that into Skyrim.

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.440
I don't care about Diablo 3 coming out.

01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:53.300
I mean, I really don't care.

01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:55.220
I really didn't care about Star Wars that much

01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:57.620
other than I'm missing something free.

01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:02.620
I mean, you know what I like.

01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:04.740
I go for quirky and weird.

01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:07.300
So just because another person says they like it

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:08.200
or one of my friends is playing,

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:10.300
it doesn't necessarily mean that I'm gonna like it.

01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.860
I'd have to give it a try first.

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:16.100
All right, but then Technus kind of gives us

01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:17.500
our final thought on this story here.

01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:21.360
I think not enough companies make demos for their games.

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:24.160
It is a lot of work, though, to turn out a demo, I mean.

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:28.940
But yeah, I think people discover games

01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:29.780
in many different ways,

01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:31.280
and a good demo is certainly one of them.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:34.120
But a bad demo can really damn your game.

01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:36.360
You know, one other thing, I guess I wanna open this,

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.240
because I'm not so sure the article

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:39.440
got into talking about this,

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:43.140
but I think when it comes to the Xbox Live arcade games

01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:44.440
or PlayStation Network games,

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.920
those demos can really make or break the damn game.

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:49.120
I really do make my decisions based off those demos.

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:51.240
I play those demos a lot, I really do.

01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:56.240
And I think those demos are really important,

01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.740
because especially when it's so easy,

01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:02.320
just press X to upgrade, you know what I mean?

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:05.280
How easy is that if you really enjoy a demo?

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.320
Anyhow, we're gonna now take a moment

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.420
to dive into gaming history.

01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:13.660
With the classic Game of the Week segment.

01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:15.840
No demo needed here, you play it

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.720
because Dark Soccer has said so.

01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:20.100
It's the classic Game of the Week.

01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:21.480
Very interesting choice this week.

01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:22.520
I hope that you picked the music

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.760
from the first one on the list.

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.720
There was no list this week, Dark Soccer,

01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:27.680
because of the website.

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:29.080
But I told you what the game was.

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:33.060
You did, so hopefully this is the right one, we'll see.

01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:33.900
Just play.

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:38.960
Okay, so the Game of the Week is called Three Wonders,

01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:41.760
or as it was in Japan, Wonder Three.

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:44.800
And it's an arcade game that was made by Capcom in 1991

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:48.280
in a CPS1 game, and you can choose three games in it.

01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:50.720
You have Midnight Wanderers, Quest for the Chariot,

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:52.880
which in Japan is called Roosters,

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:57.880
and it has a hobbit named Lu and Shiva in it,

01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:59.480
which I wanna still say Shiva,

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:01.480
because that's how it would have been pronounced

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:03.280
in the Japanese version.

01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.040
Then there's Chariot, and then Trick through the Sky,

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.520
which is also just called Chariot in Japan.

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.280
And then Don't Pull.

01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:12.080
Midnight Wanderers is a platform game,

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:13.880
and it's actually really, really cool.

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:15.800
I've watched Dan play it through a number of times,

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:17.960
and I've played it a little bit myself, pretty fun.

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:20.440
And then Chariot is a shmup,

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:24.240
where you have Lu and Shiva as well.

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:26.780
And then Don't Pull is kind of like Pando.

01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:31.780
It's a pulling puzzle-type game.

01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:34.320
It came out in 1998 on the Sega Saturn

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.620
and on the PlayStation.

01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:37.840
And then Capcom re-released it in 2006

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.240
on the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 on PS2 and Xbox,

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.400
and Capcom Classics Collection Remix 2 on PS3.

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:49.440
Really, there's not a whole bunch to say,

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.160
because they're really simple.

01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:54.120
They speak for themselves.

01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:59.120
I mean, I've seen a lot more of Midnight Wanderers

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.560
than the other two, just because, you know,

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.360
seeing Dan play through the whole thing is pretty fun.

01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:05.640
But I think what I like best about that one

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:09.120
is I really, really, really love the art style in it.

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:11.080
It's really cool.

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:13.520
And I like the music in it a lot, too.

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:14.520
Hit me, Dan!

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:19.520
Get in here and tell us about the game.

01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:25.560
He said no, he's a butthead.

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.560
But it really is very bright, vivid colors, very pretty.

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:32.840
It's a great game.

01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:35.800
Lu also made it as an assist character

01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:37.280
for Marvel versus Capcom.

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:43.240
And he basically looked exactly like he did

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:45.380
in Midnight Wanderers.

01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:46.220
And then,

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:54.060
Sheeva was actually,

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:57.700
well, there was a character based on him for Cannon Spike.

01:48:57.700 --> 01:49:01.100
It was called Sheeva Shintaro, who was based off of him.

01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:02.460
But, I mean, that's really it.

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:04.620
I mean, it's kind of a no-brainer.

01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:06.620
Everyone should play this game.

01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:08.180
But really, everyone should just be playing

01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:10.020
the Midnight Wanderers part of the game.

01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:14.620
So the classic game of the week is Three Wonders.

01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:16.900
Or, if you want, it's just Midnight Wanderers, really.

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:19.900
Yeah, but I mean, Chariot's not bad.

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:20.740
Chariot's not bad.

01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:23.700
And I don't know, the puzzle game kind of pisses me off.

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:25.600
But then again, I suck at Pingo.

01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:29.460
I like Pingo, so I would actually check out the puzzler.

01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.220
That sounds like kind of cool.

01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:33.420
And if anyone finds a Three Wonders machine,

01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:35.660
Freakin' take a picture of it for me.

01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:37.820
Yeah, I've never even heard of this game.

01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:39.340
I really haven't.

01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:40.940
And it even runs on, like, Capcom hardware.

01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:42.300
You'd think this thing would be everywhere, so.

01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:44.900
Well, you can, I mean, you can run it on May.

01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:46.820
I'm sure, yeah, emulator, easy, but.

01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:50.620
Yeah, but it's really neat, but yeah.

01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:53.180
I think just the star of the collection

01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:54.540
is Midnight Wanderers.

01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:55.380
All right, there you go.

01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:58.860
Your classic game of the week, Three Wonders in the arcade.

01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:00.420
Never on a console, right?

01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:02.380
I just said it came out on consoles.

01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:04.260
Sorry, I was trying to deal with another issue.

01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:06.900
It came out in 1998 on the Saturn and PlayStation.

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:07.740
Oh, nice, okay.

01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:11.260
And then we got re-releases in 2006

01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:12.900
for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox,

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:15.420
which was the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2.

01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:19.460
And then the PSP is Capcom Classics Collection remixed.

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.220
All right, very cool.

01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:25.340
Very, very awesome thing to have.

01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:26.180
All right.

01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:28.860
Well, we're gonna take a break here at Orange Launch Radio,

01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:30.020
but don't go anywhere, guys.

01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:33.540
We'll be right back with part B of our show,

01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:34.820
which might be a little bit shorter,

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:36.660
but that just means more time for calls

01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:40.860
and, and coming up tonight, a list-list.

01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:42.100
And we'll tell you guys the topic

01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:43.580
when we come back in a little bit

01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:46.900
with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:51.060
["Orange Lounge Radio Theme Song"]

01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:55.060
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio

01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:56.660
for the second half of our show,

01:50:56.660 --> 01:51:01.160
live on November the 27th of 2011 at All Games Radio.

01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:03.620
Yes, our website's busted right now.

01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:05.540
If you try to visit it at OrangeLaunchRadio.com,

01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:07.780
you get a message that implies we haven't paid a bill,

01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:09.540
but trust me, if it was that easy to fix,

01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:11.980
we would've done it for the show.

01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:14.620
Keep in mind, our website is graciously donated,

01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:18.460
but you can't complain about free,

01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:20.880
so we just kinda have to wait for things

01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:22.600
to work themselves out behind the scenes.

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:25.380
So anyhow, moving on, we are still trying to tape a show

01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:27.000
so that whenever our website does get back up,

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.140
we can podcast it.

01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:29.940
And we're having fun with our live listeners

01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:31.100
who are in our chat room.

01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:33.180
You still can't get to our chat room,

01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:35.260
even without chat.orangelaunchradio.com,

01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:36.220
which you can do.

01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:40.220
You can go to any IRC client,

01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:43.540
look up Gamesurge, which is the IRC.gamesurge.net,

01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:45.600
and join Channel Orange Lounge.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:48.340
You can also do that through the All Games chat client.

01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:50.980
So if you just go over to chat.allgames.com,

01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:52.400
if you really want something online,

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:55.500
just join Channel Orange Lounge from there.

01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:56.500
That's really easy.

01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.480
We will be taking your phone calls a little later on,

01:51:58.480 --> 01:51:59.320
and so forth.

01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:00.380
We also have a list list coming up,

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.760
and we'll get to that very, very soon.

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:05.380
I hope everybody in studio has their list together.

01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:07.180
We'll be taking your votes on that soon.

01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:08.860
And you do have to be in our chat room

01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:10.240
if you want to participate with that.

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:13.240
And no mailbag tonight, sadly.

01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:15.300
We can't get to the emails, don't.

01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:17.540
But we will be getting to your tweets.

01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:19.120
So get your tweets in.

01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:20.580
If you haven't already sent those in,

01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:23.860
twitter.com slash O-L-R.

01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:25.980
No rapid fire news tonight.

01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:28.320
We're just gonna get back right into some longer news.

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.960
We'll start with, oh, I wanted to,

01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:32.900
actually, I did want to talk about this quickly.

01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:36.600
We talked about Black Friday stuff a little bit already,

01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:38.180
and just some of the craziness

01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:39.980
that was going on out there.

01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:42.460
One of the stories that I had actually grabbed

01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:45.380
was about folks that were actually pepper sprayed

01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:48.100
in the face and slammed and all this stuff.

01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:49.380
I think a lot of you guys heard about this.

01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:50.660
I'm sure it was all over the news.

01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:52.320
Some chick that was trying to get an Xbox

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:54.980
actually pepper sprayed people trying to get to it.

01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:58.100
So people just getting crazy out there.

01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:00.900
I have zero desire to participate

01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:02.580
in any of this type of Black Friday antics,

01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:06.020
but I noticed that I was leaving a Thanksgiving dinner

01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:07.740
in the Bay Area at about 1130,

01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:10.140
and I had to drive, my friend that lives there

01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:13.360
lives right by that Fry's in Fremont.

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:15.140
Or maybe it's actually Milpitas at that point.

01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:15.980
Yeah, Milpitas.

01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:18.380
Yeah, so I had to literally drive right by that.

01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:20.460
And yeah, parking lot was a madhouse,

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:22.380
and there was already a line at 1130.

01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:23.740
You know, and it just, I was like,

01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:25.180
I do not want to be anywhere near here.

01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:26.540
And it's funny because you have Fry's

01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:27.860
on the left side of the road,

01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:30.460
and then Walmart on the right side of the road.

01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:32.620
And so like all the cars in the left turn lane

01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:34.240
were backed up and all the cars in the right turn lane

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.080
were backed up.

01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:36.660
The only clear lane was the middle.

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:38.220
You could zoom right down through the middle

01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:40.180
and get back on the freeway, which is right there.

01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:43.980
So it's just, I for one would never be out

01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:45.060
in this kind of madness, but.

01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:46.060
I didn't leave the house.

01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:47.340
No, I don't blame you.

01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:48.780
You know how some of the local Fry's,

01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:51.340
they have like themes to them and stuff.

01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:52.600
Like the one we have in Roseville

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:54.860
is like railroad and stuff.

01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:57.300
The theme for the Fry's I'd given Milpitas

01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:59.180
is like black market.

01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:02.300
It's just cages and components.

01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:04.620
That's it, old school.

01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:06.620
It's like a science lab in there or something.

01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:08.380
Yeah, so yeah.

01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:11.180
I am much more of a fan of Cyber Monday,

01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:12.300
which is coming up tomorrow.

01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:14.420
And I guess some of the sales are out there already.

01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:16.220
Wait till they figure out how to pepper spray you

01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:17.220
through the computer.

01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:21.260
There's always that tumbler.

01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:22.820
You can see that pepper spray guy,

01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:24.020
Oliver was pepper spray cop,

01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:25.780
pepper spraying cop, that tumbler.

01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:27.980
Also, I wanna mention this,

01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:29.500
another great way to save money

01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:32.740
is through the sales online through services like Steam,

01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:35.300
who just had a pretty awesome sale, I gotta say.

01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:38.540
Portal 2 was $10 on Wednesday.

01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:41.820
Civilization 5 was $10 yesterday.

01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:43.100
They've been having some really good sales.

01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:44.620
I don't know if you guys have picked anything up.

01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:46.340
I actually didn't, I gotta admit,

01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:47.740
a lot of the games that were on sale

01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:48.580
that I would have bought,

01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:50.900
I already bought at full price earlier.

01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:52.380
So I didn't really indulge in the sale,

01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:53.860
except I did buy some DLC.

01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:55.860
I bought some Civ 5 DLC

01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:57.940
that I hadn't picked up before during the sale.

01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.780
Did you guys do,

01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:02.740
did you guys purchase anything through these sales?

01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:03.580
Nope.

01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:04.540
No?

01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:05.380
No?

01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:06.300
Oh.

01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:07.660
And what about you guys in our chatroom

01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:08.700
at chat.ownerswesterly.com?

01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:11.820
You know, I tried to poll the people on our Google+,

01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:12.900
our new Google Plus page,

01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:14.320
and I kinda got a very similar response,

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:16.900
where it's like, nah, didn't wanna be out fighting in it.

01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:18.500
I had a better time just kinda pointing

01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:19.340
and laughing at people.

01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:21.720
I've learned my lesson from going

01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:23.220
to some Black Friday stuff.

01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:25.700
Not necessarily lining up at like midnight or something,

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:28.100
but just going there during the day.

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:30.740
And I remember the last time I actually went out,

01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:31.920
well there was two times,

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:32.920
there was one where I went out

01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:35.860
cause I actually needed some DVD-Rs,

01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:37.460
and so I went to Best Buy.

01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:38.740
It wasn't actually that bad.

01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:39.660
There was no one,

01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:41.860
I mean it was just like in normal Saturday traffic.

01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:43.260
I think as long as you're not there

01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:47.380
like an hour or two before or after opening, it's fine.

01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:48.900
Yeah, so that was that.

01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:52.300
And then I went to Fry's one time,

01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:53.980
cause I was looking for something,

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:55.220
I don't remember exactly what now,

01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:57.000
but Fry's was terrible.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.580
And it was like in the afternoon on Black Friday,

01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:05.260
and the line was just like an hour and a half long

01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:07.180
for whatever.

01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:10.220
And I mean, that's bad when they have

01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:12.460
like 30 registers open or something,

01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:14.800
but and that line is still that long.

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:17.220
It was really bad.

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:20.140
And they had a guy walking around the balloon,

01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:23.580
a giant like weather balloon that says line ends here,

01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:24.900
and he's basically,

01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:27.960
this line just snakes through the entire store.

01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:29.300
It was ridiculous.

01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:30.140
Crazy.

01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:32.180
But yeah, I don't really like doing that stuff,

01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:34.180
and even like the recent games I've got,

01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:35.540
I actually have Call of Duty,

01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:39.060
Modern Warfare 3 that I got for free,

01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:41.300
and Skyrim I got for free,

01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:42.900
cause every now and then the publisher

01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:45.180
likes to actually send us stuff.

01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:48.520
So I played that,

01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:50.780
but I'm not going to buy any new stuff.

01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:54.260
In fact, actually probably not gonna buy any new games

01:56:54.260 --> 01:56:55.540
for a long time.

01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:57.400
I don't really know what the next new game

01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:58.240
I'd probably get with.

01:56:58.240 --> 01:56:59.080
I gotta buy Mario Kart.

01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:00.660
Borderlands 2, but that's about it.

01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:02.360
I gotta buy Mario Kart.

01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:03.980
I still have a credit on Amazon though, so.

01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:06.660
I'm seriously thinking of trading in Modern Warfare 3

01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:09.740
for like probably,

01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:13.620
I'd probably lean more towards Super Mario Land 3D

01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:14.460
than I would.

01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:15.280
It's great.

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:16.120
It's really good.

01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:17.980
Mario Kart, cause Mario Kart's kinda,

01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:20.580
it's the same stuff all over again, you know?

01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:21.420
They don't really,

01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:24.260
they're like repeating old classic tracks

01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:26.020
instead of coming up with original stuff

01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:27.860
and then adding the classic tracks.

01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:31.660
We got a couple comments in our chat rooms.

01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:34.500
Evil, or E3VL, which I think he has evil,

01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:35.500
is in our chat saying,

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:37.360
is the Cyber Monday sale separate

01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:39.540
from the Autumn sale on Steam?

01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:42.140
I'm not sure if Steam's gonna do something separate

01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:42.980
on Monday.

01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:44.060
I wouldn't anticipate it.

01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:45.220
Well there's also, remember,

01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:47.260
the Amazon Gold Box sales,

01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:48.940
which are always really good.

01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:52.100
Cyber Monday is actually an internet-wide thing.

01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:54.760
It's kind of the internet's response to Black Friday,

01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:57.100
because Monday is when everybody goes back to work.

01:57:57.100 --> 01:57:58.780
And I guess there's this perception

01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:00.700
that nobody actually works when they go back to work,

01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:02.660
instead they're online shopping all day.

01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:04.460
So all these companies do,

01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:07.080
all these companies do these big online sales on Monday.

01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:09.780
So it's totally a man-made invented thing,

01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:12.160
but hey, any excuse for a sale, right?

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:14.580
So Steam may get in on it.

01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:17.820
I know Microsoft is supposed to be doing something.

01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:20.740
They've been doing some sales on Xbox Live all week.

01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:22.500
Like you can get things like Bejeweled 3,

01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:25.420
and God, some game was only like 240,

01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:27.300
oh, I think it's Bejeweled Blitz or something,

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:29.260
it's only like 240 Microsoft points,

01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:31.320
which is about what it's worth, so.

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.160
JVMod in our chat room is talking about

01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:36.020
some of the Black Friday sales he got.

01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:38.600
I got the $200 PlayStation 3 bundle,

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:41.140
the $179.99 3DS bundle,

01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:43.980
the $199.99 42-inch TV,

01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:46.260
and a 3004 laptop.

01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:47.980
I don't know what a 3004 laptop is.

01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:49.140
I think he mistyped something.

01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:51.540
The rest of that is, sounds like you,

01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:53.540
dude, can I have a loan?

01:58:53.540 --> 01:58:55.100
Probably 300 for a laptop.

01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:56.540
Oh yeah, maybe that's what it is,

01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:57.360
300 for a laptop.

01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:59.440
Oh, $300, maybe shift F4.

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:02.240
So that's nice though.

01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:03.540
That's like your whole electronics

01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:05.460
for several years taken care of in one day.

01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:06.820
It's pretty nice.

01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:09.540
And Technus says, oh, and after working

01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:12.760
a Black Friday myself, I cannot support it.

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:13.940
You know, I got to say,

01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:15.840
props to you folks in retail,

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:17.380
especially those of you on the front lines.

01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:20.020
I mean, yeah, people pepper spraying

01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:21.500
in Walmart and shit is madness,

01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:23.020
but can you imagine having to work

01:59:23.020 --> 01:59:24.340
that Walmart that night?

01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:25.400
Oh my God.

01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:29.660
You poor people.

01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:31.240
There's a very big reason why

01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:33.560
I never want to do retail again.

01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:36.300
That's, it's all summed up in one day right there.

01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:37.660
All right, let's move on with some gaming news.

01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:38.480
Logie.

01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:41.620
Well, just because you've done what,

01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:42.760
10 of them in a row?

01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:45.360
Dan called us all blisses.

01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.780
Uh, yeah.

01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:51.820
I got a funny story, actually,

01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:54.060
about this story that I'm gonna talk about.

01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:55.640
First off, let's talk about this.

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:57.280
Ridge Racer Vita.

01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:59.880
We were talking about why people pirate stuff.

01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:01.600
This is pretty bad.

02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:04.420
Ridge Racer Vita, it only includes

02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:06.980
three courses and five cars.

02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:08.720
It sounds almost like a demo to me.

02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:13.560
Apparently, according to the Japanese press sampling

02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:15.820
of Ridge Racer, they're surprised to find

02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:19.700
that the game only has a few tracks and a few cars.

02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:22.740
They said, of course, there will be download content,

02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:27.200
but it's just weird that there's so little material.

02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:31.440
Also, apparently, I guess there's also supposed

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.900
to be this planetary league as well,

02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:36.300
which is a new mode that sounds kinda neat.

02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:38.860
Planetary league, I guess Namco is,

02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:40.860
they're gonna be sending out team battle missions

02:00:40.860 --> 02:00:44.180
for multiplayer, plus it's also playable over Wi-Fi

02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:48.420
and ad hoc and all sorts of stuff,

02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:49.660
and you can share ghost data,

02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:54.660
but three tracks and five cars, really?

02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:57.460
I mean, and on top of that.

02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:59.400
Because you know it's gonna be DLC.

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.900
And on top of that, okay, the game is supposed

02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:05.780
to be slightly cheaper than most of the Vita games,

02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:07.500
but 40 bucks instead of 50.

02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:09.220
Exactly, exactly.

02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:10.300
Boo hiss.

02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:12.980
If this is true, if this is true,

02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:15.300
then fuck this game for real.

02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:17.420
And it only runs at 30 frames per second

02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:19.140
instead of 60 frames per second.

02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:22.600
And here's, I had a dream last night about this.

02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:25.740
I seriously, for some reason, and I don't even know why,

02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:26.860
because I read this earlier in the week,

02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:29.300
some reason I just had a dream about this,

02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:33.540
and I remember I was talking to some guy

02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:37.180
who apparently, in the dream, was representative

02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:40.020
of the person responsible for this game,

02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:41.660
and my response was this.

02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:43.640
What the fuck were you thinking?

02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:45.100
I mean, really, seriously?

02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:47.860
Three fucking tracks and five cars?

02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:49.820
No one's gonna fucking buy this game.

02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:51.900
I don't give a shit if it's Ridge Racer.

02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:53.340
This is ridiculous.

02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:55.260
It's Ridge Racer.

02:01:55.260 --> 02:01:56.540
The rest of the letters are available

02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:59.100
in a $3.99 download content bundle pack.

02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:02.940
Not even, you wouldn't even finish Ridge.

02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:03.900
It'd be rid.

02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:05.820
That's all you get for this.

02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:07.580
I mean, three fucking tracks.

02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:08.420
Here's the thing.

02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:10.460
It's one thing to just openly reject this game

02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:11.660
if it does come out for $40.

02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:14.820
I hope this is just like maybe an early build,

02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:18.300
like a press build or something, like a demo.

02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:21.520
Maybe just they're really working to get the full game done

02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:23.500
and it's just not ready, you know?

02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:26.300
And it's not gonna be ready until it goes gold.

02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:28.940
I'm really hoping that's what happens.

02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:31.460
And soon we'll get this Japanese website that's like,

02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:33.540
comes with 20 tracks and 20 cars.

02:02:33.540 --> 02:02:34.380
You know, something like that.

02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:36.900
Oh, I hope so, because Ridge Racer's pretty awesome.

02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:39.020
I think for the launch, you know, the 3DS,

02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:41.740
it was one of the best games that they had available.

02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:42.580
It was, yeah.

02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:45.020
Even though there was all rehash stuff, but.

02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:48.540
But the 3D effects, it was a good 3D show-off game, yeah.

02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:50.740
But, I mean, seriously.

02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:52.580
I like Dungeon Buster in our chat room.

02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:54.340
Ridge rip-off.

02:02:55.780 --> 02:02:58.540
It is just, and it's funny though,

02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:01.500
because I actually, I watched, I was reading this

02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:02.960
and then I watched the trailer.

02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:04.720
I'm like, hey, you know what?

02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:07.520
That trailer only shows these three tracks.

02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:09.680
I wonder.

02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:12.740
But it's gonna be one thing if the game

02:03:12.740 --> 02:03:14.420
comes out like this, but it's gonna be just

02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:17.620
flat out insulting if they add a bunch of tracks

02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:18.980
as download content.

02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:20.860
Unless it's all free.

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:22.460
If it's free DLC, they won't be.

02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:23.420
But why would they do that?

02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:24.260
They won't.

02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:25.080
No.

02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:29.240
If, now here's where I would support it.

02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:32.500
Remember on the PSP, they had Rockband.

02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:33.780
You can buy Rockband in the game.

02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:36.680
Then they also had Rockband where you could buy,

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:39.600
or download the free demo, and then you pay for songs.

02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:41.160
Oh yeah, I remember that, yeah, yeah.

02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:42.000
I'm fine with that.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.380
If they wanna do this, like say,

02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:45.640
put it on the store and like, you know,

02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:48.600
okay, well, you can buy the game for nothing

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:50.840
and it comes with three tracks and five cars

02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:53.640
and you can buy the rest of the game for DLC.

02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:54.980
I'm fine with that.

02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:56.660
Or, you know, you pay 99 cents

02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:58.640
and you get the rest of this later on.

02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:01.660
But as a retail game for like,

02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:03.560
I'm assuming this is gonna be 40 bucks.

02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:05.440
I have yet to see the setup information for this

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:07.020
so I can't confirm on the price yet.

02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:08.640
Hopefully I'll know that soon.

02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:12.240
But this is, it's probably gonna be about a $40 game.

02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:13.700
Well, Namco, one thing you need to do

02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:15.960
when you get back to work this week after the holiday

02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:19.160
is you need to clarify, so I guess maybe in Japan

02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.320
they didn't really have the same holiday,

02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:22.680
but still, come next week at work,

02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:26.000
they need to clarify what the hell's going on here.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.400
What is this game actually gonna have in it?

02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:30.560
So hopefully next week we can correct that.

02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:33.040
Anyhow, let's move on.

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:38.060
A story has hit computer and video games.com

02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:40.280
about two possible, as they're calling it,

02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:43.460
Xbox 720 models that are planned.

02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:47.340
Apparently there's gonna be a dual SKU strategy expected,

02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:49.540
along with a significant Kinect upgrade.

02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:53.320
Long story short, you may or may not remember this,

02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:56.840
remember the Xbox 360 had two ways you could buy it.

02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:59.480
They had the, what, the regular, or,

02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:00.320
what was it called at the time?

02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:02.040
The core and the premium.

02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:04.540
And the leader, core and premium, yeah, that's right.

02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:09.360
And the non, one of them was what, $299, right?

02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:11.000
And that was no hard drive.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.880
$299 for the core, no hard drive.

02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:14.200
No onboard memory at the time,

02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:15.480
because this was the first Xbox.

02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:16.320
No hard drive, nothing.

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:18.400
It's just basically the box, that's it.

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:20.640
And then there was this elite version

02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:22.600
that came with a hard drive,

02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:27.400
and it came with, thank you, a wireless controller

02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:28.600
instead of a wired one.

02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:29.960
Yeah, that was the other big difference.

02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:32.120
And I think a shiny silver door

02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:33.800
as opposed to a plain white one.

02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:34.640
Yep.

02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:35.680
Whoopie doo, right?

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:38.740
So apparently that's the road they're going down

02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:40.760
for whatever this next Xbox is,

02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:44.600
is that one will be a pared down system

02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:47.280
to be released as cheaply as possible,

02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:50.440
positioned more along the lines of a set top box,

02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:53.440
because 360 as a Netflix viewing device

02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:55.440
is apparently a huge deal,

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:59.240
and perhaps a Kinect themed gaming portal.

02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:02.300
But then there will be a more fully featured machine

02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:05.080
with an optical drive, hard disk,

02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:08.140
and backward compatibility aimed at the hardcore

02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:09.960
would be released at a higher price point.

02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:11.800
Listen to that again.

02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:13.080
There's going to be a vert,

02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:14.720
maybe if rumors are to be believed,

02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:16.080
and there's gonna be rumors or anything at this point,

02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:19.900
but maybe there's gonna be an Xbox with no drive.

02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:22.660
Dude, I don't buy that there's not gonna be drive in there.

02:06:22.660 --> 02:06:24.520
Optical drives are so fucking cheap.

02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:27.720
It's just, why would you do that?

02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:30.560
I mean, because basically you're forcing people

02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:34.000
to buy the new product online.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.200
That's really the way they wanna go with it, then fine.

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:38.000
But really no optical drive?

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.280
I mean, drive, DVD drives?

02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:42.520
Okay, let's assume that it's gonna be a Blu-ray drive.

02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:46.220
Probably drives are not incredibly expensive anymore.

02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:48.960
I mean, they're not as cheap as DVD drives,

02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:50.400
that's for sure, but.

02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:51.760
You can get a Blu-ray player now

02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:53.640
for what, 80 bucks, 100 bucks?

02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:55.480
I can't imagine that those drives are that expensive.

02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:58.200
Those things used to be four or five hundred dollars.

02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:00.460
Of course, same thing could be said about DVD players.

02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:02.420
I remember a time when a DVD player was like,

02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:04.160
that's the thing the rich kids had.

02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:07.440
I just, I don't know.

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:09.120
I mean, hey, whatever, that's fine.

02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:10.320
They're giving you options,

02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:13.520
so you don't have to buy the cheap, cheap, cheap one

02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:14.520
if you really wanna.

02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:19.600
So obviously a lot of this is still to be unveiled.

02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:22.720
Another rumor is that Kinect will likely get

02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:26.560
a significant upgrade and be bundled with the console.

02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:27.420
That all makes sense.

02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:29.800
I mean, I think Kinect is something Microsoft's kind of,

02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:34.800
you know, embedded in their self now.

02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:37.100
And I think Kinect was supposed to be

02:07:37.100 --> 02:07:38.380
a higher resolution to begin with.

02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:41.320
They had to kind of take it down a resolution a little bit

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:44.720
to work with the system as it was today.

02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:46.640
But like, you know, remember we're seeing the patents

02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:49.000
for like it was gonna read sign language and shit?

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.060
Like if it had the higher resolution, it could do that.

02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:53.880
But it'll get better.

02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:54.720
It'll be interesting.

02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:57.140
Yeah, the technology will get better, that's for sure.

02:07:57.140 --> 02:07:58.480
But then here's the other thing.

02:07:58.480 --> 02:07:59.920
Can I tell you the thing that bothers me most

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:01.640
about this story?

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:05.720
As that it's called two Xbox 720 models reportedly planned.

02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:10.560
Okay, seriously, we need to stop calling it the Xbox 720

02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:12.120
because that is a stupid name.

02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:14.160
It's not gonna be called the Xbox 720.

02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:15.400
Why would you call it that?

02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:20.400
Okay, the Xbox 360 did not come after the Xbox 359, okay?

02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:24.720
It's not, you know, and I get it 360 times two is 720.

02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:26.040
But you know what?

02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:29.200
Something tells me they're gonna just go another direction

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:30.680
with the name.

02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:33.320
As to what direction they're gonna go with the name?

02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:37.980
Well, we thought we would bring back one of our old friends

02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:39.320
to help us figure that out.

02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:42.260
What exactly that name could be.

02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:43.980
And that is a segment on the show

02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:46.220
we like to call listless.

02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:50.780
That's right.

02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:55.780
Tonight's listless topic is what should we refer

02:08:56.100 --> 02:08:57.720
to the new Xbox as?

02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:59.280
What should the new Xbox be called?

02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:02.020
What should we refer to it as here on the program?

02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:04.560
Because we're not calling it the Xbox 720 anymore.

02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:08.220
So what should the new name for the Xbox two

02:09:08.220 --> 02:09:09.260
or whatever it's gonna be,

02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:11.240
or I guess it would really be Xbox three,

02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:12.660
what should it be called?

02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:15.580
Okay, so if you wanna give us suggestions,

02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:18.100
you can in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.

02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:20.420
But this is a highly scientific process, people.

02:09:20.420 --> 02:09:21.500
Here's the way the list works

02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:25.020
if you've never listened to listless before on the show.

02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:27.200
We're each gonna go around and give our top three answers.

02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:28.780
That'll come up with a list of nines.

02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:29.640
We have no guests tonight.

02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:31.800
Usually it's a list of 12, not tonight.

02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:33.080
But then we're each gonna go around

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:35.100
and take one off the list.

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:36.260
Oh, that's the hard part.

02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:38.320
That'll leave a list of six,

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:41.200
which you guys will go around and vote on your number one

02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:42.620
and number two answers for.

02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:44.660
And we're gonna get a definitive answer

02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:48.940
for what should the new Xbox be called?

02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:49.780
All right.

02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:53.260
So chat.orangelandradio.com

02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:54.180
if you wanna give our suggestion.

02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:56.980
Excuse me, I forgot that doesn't work tonight.

02:09:56.980 --> 02:09:59.180
Channel Orange Lounge on IRC Game Surge

02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:00.900
if you wanna give your suggestions.

02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:03.060
Let's start building the list.

02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:06.580
So we will start with, we'll start with Loki tonight.

02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:07.700
Your number three answer,

02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:09.580
what should they call the new Xbox?

02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:11.440
Or what should we refer to it as here on the show?

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:14.280
Well, the way they have been changing their naming schemes

02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:16.340
for things like, especially Windows operating system

02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:18.260
and stuff before it used to be Windows 95,

02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:20.100
Vista, and they'd have clunky names.

02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:23.340
Now it's Windows 7 and they're talking about Windows 8.

02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:26.440
So I'm just gonna say Microsoft Xbox 3.

02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:29.120
And when I close my eyes, it's all that I need.

02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:31.200
Because it's simplified that's,

02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:34.200
I know it makes no sense, 363, but whatever.

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:36.360
So you're just gonna say, just call it the Xbox 3.

02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:37.180
Xbox 3.

02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:38.020
Why not?

02:10:38.020 --> 02:10:39.020
It works for PlayStation.

02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:40.180
Why not?

02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:41.200
All right.

02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:44.880
Let's go to DarkSakura, your number three answer

02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:46.460
for what should the new Xbox be referred to

02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:47.520
as here on the program?

02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:48.800
Xbox 420.

02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:55.400
I wonder what this system does.

02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:58.680
Oh man, suddenly I want to eat some Cheetos.

02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:00.560
Oh, what do you want to play?

02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:01.400
Fuck it.

02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:06.560
Why is Cheech and Chong suddenly the spokespeople

02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:07.980
for this system?

02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:10.760
Or I guess now it's Harold and Kumar, I guess.

02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:12.640
The Xbox 420, got to make some more of them.

02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:14.480
All right, the Xbox 420.

02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:15.320
All right.

02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:16.140
I don't know, man.

02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:18.000
They have Neil Patrick Harris back in the system.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:18.840
That's true.

02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:21.280
That is an unstoppable force right there.

02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:23.400
Can I just say for a minute on a completely random,

02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:26.520
stop the list list, the new Muppets movie

02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:27.780
was so fucking awesome.

02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:33.600
Like for real, it was a kid's movie for 30 year olds.

02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:34.480
He has a cameo.

02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:36.840
A lot of people have a cameo that they don't tell you about.

02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:38.120
Neil Patrick Harris is one of them.

02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:39.680
Also, and it's a great line too.

02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:44.140
His voice makes the line for California screaming tolerable.

02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:44.980
Yes.

02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:47.640
I'm just saying the new Muppets movie is really fucking good.

02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:49.980
It's a little bit hokey cause it's a kid's movie,

02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:51.520
but it's great.

02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:53.120
When someone buys my ticket, I'll go see it.

02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:54.640
What cameo?

02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:56.800
Line for what?

02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:00.040
Okay, he's now the announcer for California screaming.

02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:03.240
So he does the safety announcement,

02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:05.540
kind of like a fair barker.

02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:08.720
And then when you're in, sorry Rob.

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:11.000
Sorry, it's a name suggested in chat.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.980
See, you in the chat can influence the list

02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:15.000
cause I just saw a name in there

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
I am fucking taking for the list.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:22.000
So when you're actually in the thing ready to go,

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.560
it says second thoughts, too late.

02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:26.940
Five, four, three, two, one, boom.

02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:28.800
Nice, all right.

02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:30.200
So it makes it all the way better.

02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:31.560
All right, back to the list.

02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:35.320
So so far we have Microsoft Xbox three and Xbox four 20.

02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:37.720
I now I have to explain this name a little bit.

02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:41.740
My name is the Dex box.

02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:45.660
The Dex box because Dex is short for what

02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:48.320
in Dungeons and Dragons speak dexterity.

02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.920
That's something that thieves have a high amount of.

02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:53.720
So it's the Dex box.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.960
And so via Microsoft Dex box steal from you.

02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:00.160
You know what?

02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:01.060
I always played Rangers.

02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:02.200
All right.

02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:05.640
The Microsoft Dex box is my answer.

02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:07.980
Let's go to Loki for your number two answer.

02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:12.040
Oh, I'm trying to think of really stupid Microsoft names.

02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:17.360
Let's see.

02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:20.600
The Microsoft windows eight entertainment system.

02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:22.360
Yes, it's very generic and stupid,

02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:23.200
but you know what?

02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:24.320
It's something that sounds like

02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:26.440
it could be a Microsoft product.

02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:28.400
The windows eight entertainment system.

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:30.000
Who would call it the waiters?

02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:33.720
Waiters.

02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:38.060
There's a fly in my soup waiters.

02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:43.200
Only if Harvey Fierstein can be the spokesperson

02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:44.560
for the waiters.

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:45.400
That would be great.

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:51.680
I call my mother and tell her to get a waiters.

02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:53.120
You could have been a doctor,

02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:54.840
but instead you're a waiters.

02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:58.120
I don't know why.

02:13:58.120 --> 02:13:59.480
When I hear the name waiters,

02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:01.360
I think about Harvey Fierstein,

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:02.320
but it just works.

02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:03.160
Doesn't it?

02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:06.700
I could have retired and broke her.

02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:07.800
The waiters.

02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:09.580
It has high definition connect.

02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:14.580
You can see how big your wiener is.

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:22.120
It's the way it is.

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.020
And I'll tell you eight isn't enough.

02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:26.560
Okay.

02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:27.400
Moving on.

02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:29.600
Dark soccer.

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:32.120
What's your number two pick?

02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:33.280
Zoom box.

02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:35.040
I almost said your number eight pick.

02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:36.800
Your number two pick zoom box.

02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:37.640
Zoom box.

02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:38.960
Oh, zoom box.

02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:40.440
X, U, N, E, B, O, X.

02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:45.040
You want to spell it with an X instead of a Z?

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:48.040
Oh, okay.

02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:48.880
Yeah.

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:49.720
No, I like it.

02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:51.600
It's like, it's like Shusha.

02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:52.720
Or you can spell it with a Z.

02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:53.560
That's fine.

02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:54.400
You have to spell it with a Z

02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:55.640
because that's what the thing is.

02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:56.480
I don't know.

02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:57.600
I was just in the X thing.

02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:58.440
Okay.

02:14:58.440 --> 02:14:59.260
Zoom box.

02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:00.320
Even though I think Microsoft retired

02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:01.600
the zoom some time ago.

02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:03.560
Oh yeah.

02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:04.400
They have zoom work.

02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:05.240
Okay.

02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:06.060
Zoom box.

02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:06.900
I could see that.

02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:07.740
Maybe the zoom would be safe.

02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:10.880
Cause it's cooler to have it zoom box.

02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:11.720
Oh, sorry.

02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:12.560
No dash.

02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:13.380
Yeah.

02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:14.220
That's how I would brand it.

02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:15.060
If they would hire me.

02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:17.200
Damn it.

02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:18.040
Microsoft.

02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:19.160
You should hire me to be your designer

02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:20.160
because I'm amazing.

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:22.460
And I make all your stuff look like Apple stuff.

02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:26.400
All right.

02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:27.240
Let's move on.

02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:28.600
My number two answer.

02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:30.480
I'm going to just put this.

02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:31.780
This is the rumored name.

02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:34.040
And I do like this as a name for the system.

02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:36.860
And just in case this really is the name,

02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:38.440
I would like to be able to say we were right.

02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:39.440
And we called it on the list.

02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:42.200
So I'm going to put X-Box loop on the list.

02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:43.500
Cause loop is the rumored name

02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:44.960
or at least the working title.

02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:48.140
That's a stupid name.

02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:49.080
Well, it makes sense though.

02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:51.080
360 and then loop.

02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:51.900
I don't know.

02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:53.000
It's X-Box loop.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.640
It makes me think back to the books I was reading.

02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:58.200
Spiral, loop, and then.

02:15:58.200 --> 02:15:59.040
All right.

02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:02.360
So that means that like some crazy ass dead girl

02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:04.460
is going to climb out of my X-Box loop.

02:16:04.460 --> 02:16:07.900
When I don't change a disc for seven days.

02:16:07.900 --> 02:16:09.100
And that's how they'll market it.

02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:10.860
Is that, you know, in seven days,

02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:12.100
this machine will kill you.

02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:13.500
All right.

02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:15.460
Number one answer time.

02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:17.620
Loki, number one for the list.

02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:19.580
Let's see.

02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:27.060
I'm going to do, let's see the Microsoft,

02:16:27.060 --> 02:16:32.060
the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.

02:16:32.060 --> 02:16:37.060
There we go.

02:16:38.220 --> 02:16:40.900
The Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.

02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:42.820
Wherever did that name come from?

02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:45.460
They named it after the players.

02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:51.180
We took your feedback and we incorporated it

02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:54.540
into the name of our new machine and our problem.

02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:56.980
We have an algorithm running that monitors

02:16:56.980 --> 02:17:00.900
all sorts of voice communication over the system

02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:03.420
and it's generated the perfect name

02:17:03.420 --> 02:17:05.940
for our system based off of the language

02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:07.220
that is used the most.

02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:12.260
It's the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur

02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:14.300
or the MTRS.

02:17:15.900 --> 02:17:16.740
Okay.

02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:20.540
Dark Sakura, your number one answer.

02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:21.740
It's completely stupid.

02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:22.920
It's X rhombus.

02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:25.780
Cause I would really like to see them make something

02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:27.140
in the shape of a rhomboid.

02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:29.500
All right.

02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:31.300
Smell and shit.

02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:32.140
Okay.

02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:33.900
I'm going to say for my number one is okay.

02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:36.640
Originally I was going to do the X-Box penetrator,

02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:41.180
which I still like as a name, but I got to say,

02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:44.060
I was won over by something that was suggested in chat

02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:47.280
because somebody brought up an old ass OLR joke.

02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:50.620
That's seriously like seven years old at this point.

02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:53.260
So I give props to, I think it was SSJ 100 Matt

02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:54.100
that said it.

02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:55.620
Yeah, it was SSJ 100 Matt that said it.

02:17:55.620 --> 02:17:58.500
I'm going to go with his answer for my number one,

02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:02.240
the X-Box non-silon occupied Caprica.

02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:10.540
Because this robots for the good guys,

02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:13.500
we promise as these devices in our living room

02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:15.020
become more self-aware.

02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:18.300
The X-Box non-silon occupied Caprica.

02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:19.140
All right.

02:18:20.020 --> 02:18:21.340
This is a really shitty list.

02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:23.180
It is.

02:18:23.180 --> 02:18:24.460
This is one of our worst.

02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:25.280
All right.

02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:26.120
At least we got Harvey Fierstein.

02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:26.960
All right.

02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:29.900
So we have the Microsoft X-Box three,

02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:34.820
the X-Box four 20, the Dex box,

02:18:34.820 --> 02:18:38.700
the waiters, the windows eight entertainment system,

02:18:38.700 --> 02:18:42.700
the Zune box, the X-Box loop,

02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:46.120
the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur,

02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:51.120
the X rhombus and the X-Box non-silon occupied Caprica.

02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:54.860
I think what I'm going to do just because, you know,

02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:56.720
we don't have a fourth person with us tonight

02:18:56.720 --> 02:18:57.560
doing this with us.

02:18:57.560 --> 02:18:59.620
I'm going to go with one I'm seeing in chat a lot

02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:01.160
and just add it to the list.

02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:03.380
I'm going to go with the X-Box lube,

02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:05.500
which I'm seeing in the chat several times.

02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:07.700
And I think that's off of mispronunciation.

02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:08.540
I made a couple-

02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:09.560
Let's call Dan in to pick one too.

02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:11.820
A couple of weeks ago on the show,

02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:13.820
I think I said I was talking about the loop

02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:16.420
and I think I accidentally said the mic for the X-Box lube

02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:17.260
or something like that.

02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:19.900
And so everybody's like, let's call it that.

02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:20.740
So fine.

02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:21.560
You're ready.

02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:22.520
That'd be the game.

02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:23.360
We're.

02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:28.360
It's time to open up some room in your entertainment system.

02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:35.680
Oh, Dan, Dan's voting for waiters.

02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:36.520
All right.

02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:38.320
Forget it.

02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:39.140
We got to go to the next thing.

02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:39.980
All right.

02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:40.820
We added one based on chats.

02:19:40.820 --> 02:19:42.060
We added X-Box lube.

02:19:42.060 --> 02:19:43.340
So now we have a list of 10.

02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:45.780
We're going to take this down to a list of seven.

02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:50.520
Sadly, it's time to start eliminating things from the list.

02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:51.360
Lucky.

02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:52.540
Oh wait, let me read you the list so far.

02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:53.380
Oh wait.

02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:54.200
I already did.

02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:55.040
Sorry.

02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:55.880
I'm excited.

02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:57.220
Do you need more soda?

02:19:57.220 --> 02:19:58.540
The X-Box lube gets me excited.

02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:00.040
What's wrong, Rob?

02:20:01.060 --> 02:20:02.260
So hard.

02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:03.500
Waiters.

02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:04.700
I need more sugar.

02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:07.340
You're my sugar nut.

02:20:08.740 --> 02:20:10.780
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:20:10.780 --> 02:20:11.920
Dex Fox.

02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:14.780
You didn't like my dexterity joke.

02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:16.700
It's stretching it.

02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:17.540
Sounds too much.

02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:22.540
Oh, it's stretching it yet another catchphrase

02:20:23.940 --> 02:20:25.380
for the X-Box lube.

02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:31.580
Stretching the bounds of your imagination.

02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:34.020
Can you take this all in?

02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:35.860
All right.

02:20:35.860 --> 02:20:37.020
We have to take it slow.

02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:41.520
Dark soccer.

02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:42.620
The cat new catchphrase.

02:20:42.620 --> 02:20:43.820
Just try to relax.

02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:46.540
Dark soccer.

02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:48.420
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:20:48.420 --> 02:20:50.420
It's nothing against you, Rob.

02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:51.260
But?

02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:54.260
But I'm taking off X-Box lube

02:20:54.260 --> 02:20:55.580
because I think it's...

02:20:56.760 --> 02:20:58.180
I hope that's not the official name

02:20:58.180 --> 02:20:59.620
and I wouldn't want us to be associated

02:20:59.620 --> 02:21:01.300
with it if it's the official name.

02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:03.700
All right, so the X-Box lube comes off the list.

02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:05.940
Dang, you guys eliminated almost my whole list.

02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:06.780
All right.

02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:07.820
Well, I'm not taking my own answer off.

02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:09.760
I gotta leave at least one up there.

02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:11.940
So the one I'm gonna take off...

02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:14.420
I'm gonna take off Microsoft X-Box 3.

02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:15.260
It's just...

02:21:15.260 --> 02:21:16.100
Stupid.

02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:16.940
Yeah, it's...

02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:17.900
The PlayStation does that.

02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:18.740
Come on.

02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:21.900
I am making the chatters be more creative tonight

02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:23.580
than pick that answer.

02:21:23.580 --> 02:21:24.900
All right.

02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:26.620
So here it is.

02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:29.260
This is the official list that you can vote on.

02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:31.620
I wonder what's gonna win.

02:21:31.620 --> 02:21:33.900
Your number one and number two answers are welcome

02:21:33.900 --> 02:21:36.340
through private message to sky in the chat room right now.

02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:37.220
Here it is.

02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:39.000
X-Box 420.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.020
Windows 8 Entertainment System.

02:21:41.020 --> 02:21:41.940
Waiters.

02:21:41.940 --> 02:21:43.020
Zoonbox.

02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:45.380
Microsoft Teabag Rage Quit Racial Slur.

02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:46.340
X-Rombus.

02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:48.700
X-Box Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:50.700
And the X-Box Lube.

02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:53.480
Send a private message to sky with your votes

02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:55.900
for number one and number two answers.

02:21:55.900 --> 02:21:58.060
If you don't say which is one and which is two,

02:21:58.060 --> 02:21:59.580
then I assume your first one is one

02:21:59.580 --> 02:22:00.940
and your second one is two.

02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:04.100
And of course now everybody is coming up.

02:22:04.100 --> 02:22:05.360
Everybody's a comic now.

02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:06.600
Act deaf in our chat room.

02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:07.580
X-Box Lube.

02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:08.780
Get ready to stretch.

02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:09.620
Hecht.

02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:10.440
X-Box Lube.

02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:11.400
We're stretching it.

02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:12.480
Dungeon Buster.

02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:16.280
Gives new meaning to the term Red Ring of Death.

02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:21.280
Oh, we're so mature.

02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:24.140
All right.

02:22:24.140 --> 02:22:27.820
I'm glad you guys decided on some high brow entertainment

02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:28.660
for your day.

02:22:29.620 --> 02:22:30.460
All right.

02:22:30.460 --> 02:22:32.060
Sadly, there's no mailbag tonight.

02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:33.900
Sadly.

02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:34.740
But there's always,

02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:38.900
but there's always time for some FUs of the week.

02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:43.900
Yay.

02:22:54.620 --> 02:22:57.220
FU to stuff and things.

02:22:57.220 --> 02:23:00.240
And the stuff and things are actually stuff and things

02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:02.460
that I'm not liberty to openly discuss.

02:23:02.460 --> 02:23:05.660
And then FU to,

02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:09.540
I'm going to get political here.

02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:13.140
FU to people who vote a straight party ticket

02:23:13.140 --> 02:23:18.140
and FU to people in high positions

02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:20.180
who think they can cheat and get away with it

02:23:20.180 --> 02:23:22.580
because they have cheated and gotten away with it.

02:23:22.580 --> 02:23:24.560
People wonder why everyone's so pissed.

02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:25.400
Done.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:28.860
Fuck you to the local news stations

02:23:28.860 --> 02:23:32.140
for counting down to Black Friday.

02:23:32.140 --> 02:23:33.620
It was so annoying.

02:23:33.620 --> 02:23:35.800
It's 11 o'clock and there are people lined up.

02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:36.640
Yes.

02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:38.220
People line up every single year.

02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:39.740
It's not fucking news.

02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:43.260
Don't be amazed that people are lined up for sales.

02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:45.040
They do it all the damn time.

02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:51.620
FU to the fact that my vacation from work is almost over.

02:23:51.620 --> 02:23:52.540
I mean, I like my job and all,

02:23:52.540 --> 02:23:55.540
but I really like sitting at home on my ass doing nothing.

02:23:55.540 --> 02:23:58.740
And then FU to the fact that I'm like really getting hungry,

02:23:58.740 --> 02:24:02.160
but I have a lovely dinner that Alan's been working on

02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:03.720
literally all day in the crock pot,

02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:04.680
waiting for me when I get home.

02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:05.860
So I have that to look forward to.

02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:09.380
But in the meantime, God damn, I want a donut.

02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:11.080
FU to donuts for being delicious.

02:24:11.080 --> 02:24:13.960
Fuck you to Krispy Kreme not being in Northern California.

02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:15.620
I get Krispy Kreme in two months.

02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:18.020
FU to Krispy Kreme not being next door.

02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:19.420
I get Krispy Kreme in two months.

02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:20.900
Did you work that all out?

02:24:20.900 --> 02:24:21.920
Huh?

02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:24.020
Well, that's still the goal time, so.

02:24:24.020 --> 02:24:25.020
Gotcha.

02:24:25.020 --> 02:24:27.740
All right, well, let's go back to some gaming news

02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:29.900
and then the Skypline's coming up real soon.

02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:31.700
1877 Game OLR, but not yet

02:24:31.700 --> 02:24:33.180
because we still have a few more stories to get through

02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:34.460
starting with Loki.

02:24:34.460 --> 02:24:37.860
Yes, we were talking about new Xbox systems

02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:41.900
and well, this is something that is kind of branching out

02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:43.300
the Kinect a little bit.

02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:44.940
Kinect for Windows.

02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:46.740
It's gonna be using a new Kinect camera

02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:48.260
because before I was like, well, you got to sit

02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:50.720
eight feet away from your damn computer to use this thing.

02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:53.040
But no, they're actually gonna include a firmware

02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:55.820
that's gonna support a new near mode

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:57.100
that's designed to see objects

02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:59.980
as close as 50 centimeters away from the camera.

02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:04.980
And I guess also they're launching with this

02:25:06.580 --> 02:25:09.580
in early 2012 a Kinect Accelerator program

02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:12.700
which will give $20,000 each to 10 startups

02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:16.860
using Kinect along with Microsoft development tools,

02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:19.120
marketing visibility, and mentoring.

02:25:20.260 --> 02:25:21.340
So it'll be interesting to see

02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:24.900
what they use Kinect for, you know, the PC.

02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:27.140
And obviously maybe we'll see this integrated

02:25:27.140 --> 02:25:31.860
into, you know, like laptops and stuff like that.

02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:35.160
So it might be interesting to see how this evolves.

02:25:37.260 --> 02:25:38.820
One other thing I was gonna mention too

02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:41.620
is kind of a story that we got left out.

02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:45.500
There's a rumor that Microsoft is in the early stages

02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:50.500
of licensing with Sony for a Kinect-enabled TV.

02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:51.680
And obviously-

02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:53.040
Oh yeah, I had heard about that.

02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:55.260
Obviously it's supposed to be, I would imagine,

02:25:55.260 --> 02:25:58.420
some sort of like, I don't know,

02:25:58.420 --> 02:26:00.860
maybe some sort of web-enabled TV.

02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:03.100
You know how they have the enhanced TVs now

02:26:04.220 --> 02:26:07.440
where you can browse content online, maybe different apps.

02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:10.340
Or maybe that's how you'll browse through movies,

02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:13.900
you know, doing Netflix and that kind of stuff through a TV.

02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:16.340
Be interesting to see that actually happen.

02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:18.580
I mean, and also it'd be weird to see Sony

02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:21.820
partnering with Microsoft on something, but I don't know.

02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:23.700
Well, they're gonna, I mean,

02:26:23.700 --> 02:26:25.260
I would think it's somewhat inevitable

02:26:25.260 --> 02:26:28.620
that the next Xbox, whatever we're gonna end up calling it,

02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:30.820
which we'll find out here in a minute,

02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:32.340
could have Blu-ray in it.

02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:34.260
Because, you know, it's gonna be able to, I mean,

02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:36.860
I would think they'd go with a proprietary disc,

02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:38.660
but maybe if it's really supposed to be, you know,

02:26:38.660 --> 02:26:40.520
the whole Netflix-

02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:41.460
I would think Blu-ray

02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:43.260
because they're gonna try to get in on that.

02:26:43.260 --> 02:26:44.480
So they're gonna have to kind of partner

02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:45.980
with Sony for that anyway.

02:26:45.980 --> 02:26:47.700
So it could be interesting.

02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:50.180
Could be very interesting.

02:26:50.180 --> 02:26:53.860
Anyway, you give us Blu-ray and we'll give you Kinect.

02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:56.940
Are you interested in Kinect for Windows at all, Loki?

02:26:56.940 --> 02:26:59.580
No, because I work on my laptop mostly.

02:26:59.580 --> 02:27:04.580
So, I mean, hell, I don't use Kinect anyways on my 360.

02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:08.320
Did you see that super fuzzy, wuzzy, feel-good commercial

02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:11.180
that Xtafer had posted on his Facebook,

02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:13.100
where he's like, I really like the music in this.

02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:15.300
Ah, I've seen that before.

02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:17.000
It showed like the doctors using Kinect.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.280
It was basically an Apple commercial, but with Kinect.

02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:22.300
I've seen that before and it's a neat concept

02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:24.800
that they're showing these classrooms enabled

02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:28.580
with all this big projection screens and doing stuff.

02:27:28.580 --> 02:27:30.140
It's just like the, what was it,

02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:32.260
Cisco commercials that they have

02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:35.780
where there's kids in the US talking to kids in China

02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:38.420
through almost like a portal or whatever.

02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:43.660
You know, like some sort of webcam projection setup

02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:44.900
or whatever that they got.

02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:47.820
But, I mean, I don't know.

02:27:47.820 --> 02:27:50.300
It's a neat idea that they'll eventually do this stuff,

02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:53.180
but definitely with Kinect for Windows

02:27:53.180 --> 02:27:56.780
and people creating new applications for it.

02:27:56.780 --> 02:27:59.380
I could see more of that stuff coming about,

02:27:59.380 --> 02:28:04.380
but it's too ideal for me.

02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:08.900
Idealistic, I guess would be the word.

02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:14.620
All right, I'm gonna move on with another story here.

02:28:14.620 --> 02:28:16.900
This is also the very, very, very, very, very last call

02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:20.500
for cage, or not cage match, listless votes.

02:28:20.500 --> 02:28:21.700
Cause we're about done.

02:28:23.340 --> 02:28:25.300
There's an interesting petition going on out there.

02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:26.260
And this is not, okay,

02:28:26.260 --> 02:28:27.860
there's like two things going on right now.

02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:29.980
There's a really funny thing going around Facebook,

02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:31.780
which is from like a parody site,

02:28:31.780 --> 02:28:36.760
which is about how Xbox is turning everybody gay

02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:37.940
and all this stuff, or not Xbox,

02:28:37.940 --> 02:28:40.020
Skyrim is turning everybody gay and all this stuff.

02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:40.860
And it promotes the-

02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:42.300
You mean Skyrim job?

02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:43.480
Exactly, something like that.

02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:45.180
That was a really funny parody article

02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:46.780
is on like Christwire or something like that.

02:28:46.780 --> 02:28:49.680
It's like a onion site for religious sites.

02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.580
But anyway, what I really wanna share

02:28:51.580 --> 02:28:52.940
is this is actually a serious thing.

02:28:52.940 --> 02:28:54.580
This is a White House petition.

02:28:54.580 --> 02:28:56.860
Cause you know the whitehouse.gov website

02:28:56.860 --> 02:28:58.480
will let you do your own petition.

02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:00.780
And somebody actually started one on there,

02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:05.780
urging the president to ban the Elder Scrolls Skyrim

02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:09.620
for the safety of America's youths.

02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:11.880
There were five backers that signed the petition

02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:15.020
at the time this was posted around gaming blogs.

02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:17.180
Of course, tons more people have signed it as a joke

02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:19.140
or whatever after that.

02:29:19.140 --> 02:29:23.440
But yeah, it's basically petitioning the Obama administration.

02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:24.280
Let me read this.

02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:26.920
Quote, immediately banned the deadly video game

02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:29.900
known as Skyrim for the safety of America's youths.

02:29:29.900 --> 02:29:32.100
Whereas video gaming has proven to cause social,

02:29:32.100 --> 02:29:34.340
ethical, and health problems in people of all ages.

02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:35.180
No it's not.

02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:37.760
Whereas sexual perversion and homosexuality

02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:39.900
are threatening to destroy the Christian foundations

02:29:39.900 --> 02:29:41.460
on which this nation was built.

02:29:43.420 --> 02:29:44.260
Did you hear that?

02:29:44.260 --> 02:29:47.060
Your relationship is threatening America.

02:29:47.060 --> 02:29:47.900
You know what?

02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:49.900
Do you feel threatened by my relationship?

02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:50.860
Girl, no.

02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:53.020
Well you should be threatened.

02:29:53.020 --> 02:29:54.020
Dance is a little bit.

02:29:54.020 --> 02:29:55.360
He knows how to cook.

02:29:56.700 --> 02:29:57.560
Anyhow.

02:29:57.560 --> 02:29:58.760
I'm not totally not threatened

02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:01.180
cause I want to come over for dinner.

02:30:01.180 --> 02:30:03.280
Whereas a new video game has just been created

02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:05.500
that far exceeds any others in the psychological

02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:08.740
and spiritual damage it does to teens.

02:30:08.740 --> 02:30:12.060
We ask you to ban Skyrim blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:30:12.060 --> 02:30:17.060
I guess this petition may have actually been created

02:30:17.580 --> 02:30:19.720
by that same parody website.

02:30:20.700 --> 02:30:22.380
But whatever, it's still interesting

02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:23.980
that you can post this out there

02:30:23.980 --> 02:30:25.740
and that it is on the official White House site.

02:30:25.740 --> 02:30:27.860
And I bet you people signed that

02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:29.580
not knowing that it was parody.

02:30:29.580 --> 02:30:30.660
I bet a lot of people signed it

02:30:30.660 --> 02:30:32.420
not knowing if it really was parody.

02:30:32.420 --> 02:30:33.580
They didn't really know that.

02:30:33.580 --> 02:30:34.740
That's just sad.

02:30:34.740 --> 02:30:35.620
Yeah.

02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:40.620
So I want to create a petition banning online petitions.

02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:42.340
How's that sound?

02:30:42.340 --> 02:30:43.180
Cool.

02:30:43.180 --> 02:30:44.240
If you want a petition for something,

02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:47.000
you go stand outside of a Walmart and get signatures.

02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:50.840
I'd be like, hey, well, you know,

02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:52.680
they did that on an episode of bullshit.

02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:53.520
Did they?

02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:58.520
About misguided patriotism and how people,

02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:00.680
if they hear certain keywords,

02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:02.480
will sign just about anything.

02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:03.480
I mean, but then again, they did.

02:31:03.480 --> 02:31:04.620
Protect children.

02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:06.840
Yeah, but they actually did show

02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:10.000
that it was actually the majority of people

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.960
who I think wouldn't actually sign it

02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:14.280
because they stopped to think about it.

02:31:14.280 --> 02:31:16.480
But then again, they also had a petition out

02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:21.480
at a Greenpeace rally to ban H2O.

02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:24.640
Oh yeah.

02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:25.960
I think I remember something like that.

02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:30.840
Like it was like ban chemical name and it was like water.

02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:31.680
Yeah.

02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:32.520
Yeah.

02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:33.340
Or soda or something like that.

02:31:33.340 --> 02:31:34.340
It was water.

02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:35.180
Was it?

02:31:35.180 --> 02:31:36.560
But they were like, it's dangerous chemical

02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:38.640
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:39.800
Gotcha.

02:31:39.800 --> 02:31:41.080
Interesting.

02:31:41.080 --> 02:31:41.920
All right.

02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:43.400
One more story from you, DarkSakura.

02:31:43.400 --> 02:31:45.360
And then it's almost time for the tweets.

02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:46.640
Like dihydrogenoxide.

02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:48.400
At twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:50.520
Hydrogen dioxide.

02:31:50.520 --> 02:31:51.360
All right.

02:31:52.680 --> 02:31:53.520
I'm being dumb.

02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:54.440
Okay.

02:31:54.440 --> 02:31:55.840
So I have another article.

02:31:56.780 --> 02:31:58.040
Google Chrome.

02:31:58.040 --> 02:31:59.960
Yay, Google Chrome.

02:31:59.960 --> 02:32:03.240
Well, it's actually going to be adding in

02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:05.720
more hardware support to the browser,

02:32:05.720 --> 02:32:07.680
including using a game pad.

02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:12.680
So not only will you be able to, you know, play your games,

02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:15.900
you can play your games with your actual game pad.

02:32:15.900 --> 02:32:18.680
And that means it's going to be, you know,

02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:22.360
a lot more of these web only games

02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:24.600
or it should actually start being easier to play.

02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:27.240
I mean, we might see a bit more development for, you know,

02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:28.400
true console style games.

02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:31.200
I mean, we've already got a lot of NES games

02:32:31.200 --> 02:32:32.940
emulated in flash.

02:32:32.940 --> 02:32:33.840
We might see more.

02:32:33.840 --> 02:32:38.840
And I like the idea of game pads in browsers,

02:32:39.320 --> 02:32:40.780
but that's just going to lead to even more

02:32:40.780 --> 02:32:43.680
of the emulation websites stuff.

02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:44.520
There's a little bit more.

02:32:44.520 --> 02:32:45.360
Yeah.

02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:50.280
Google's actually going to put in support for web RTC,

02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:53.480
which is a video chat thing,

02:32:53.480 --> 02:32:56.640
but Firefox already has game pad support for the record.

02:32:56.640 --> 02:32:58.440
Can I actually say that I do really like though,

02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:01.720
that, you know, we had a story last week or the week before

02:33:01.720 --> 02:33:04.800
or whenever we had a show about how, like,

02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:07.560
you can get demos for games through YouTube now,

02:33:07.560 --> 02:33:08.920
like there was that FIFA game.

02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:10.800
Like, so it would make a lot of sense

02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:13.420
that game pads will be enabled within the browser

02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:14.880
because like a lot of stuff seems like

02:33:14.880 --> 02:33:16.920
it's going to be streaming like right through your browser

02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:19.320
and shit, people play the Facebook games

02:33:19.320 --> 02:33:23.200
and probably a Google Plus game is looking at using this

02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:24.620
if Google Chrome is launching it.

02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:27.680
So it's interesting.

02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:29.520
But yeah, that's that kind of support.

02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:30.760
I can support.

02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:32.400
Ha.

02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:33.600
All right.

02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:34.660
Let's see.

02:33:34.660 --> 02:33:37.560
We're about to get to the Twitter and last minute stories,

02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:39.600
but I think we should do some listless results.

02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:41.340
Shouldn't we find out what we're going to be calling

02:33:41.340 --> 02:33:43.280
the new Xbox officially?

02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:44.120
Well, yeah.

02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:46.680
Cause you know, after tonight, it's no more Xbox 720.

02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:48.360
We will be calling it by this name.

02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:50.640
The bend over and take it like a man.

02:33:50.640 --> 02:33:51.620
Let's find out.

02:33:51.620 --> 02:33:54.880
Let's see if, let's see who got their way.

02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:59.880
In at number three is a tie.

02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:05.120
Number three answer for what we should call the new system.

02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:09.680
The Xbox 420 as you know, we have a few stoners in our chat

02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:13.960
and the Microsoft teabag rage quit racial slur.

02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:15.160
Yeah.

02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:17.340
Tied for your number three answer.

02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:20.440
The number two thing you most want to call the new Xbox

02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:24.920
is the Xbox non-silon occupied Caprica.

02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:26.880
Yay.

02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:30.360
And the number one answer, can I put it this way?

02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:33.320
It got twice as many votes as the number two answer.

02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:34.440
The number one answer.

02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:39.440
The Xbox lube is the official name of the new Xbox console.

02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:42.360
Congratulations, chatters.

02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:45.960
Congratulations, Microsoft and the Xbox lube.

02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:47.560
Do you think you can handle it?

02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:51.440
I think it should be bend over and take it like a man.

02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:55.440
Very, very narrowly missing the list by the way.

02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:57.320
Waiters didn't make the top three.

02:34:57.320 --> 02:34:58.440
Did you notice that?

02:34:58.440 --> 02:34:59.840
That's poopy.

02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:02.240
Even after my Harvey Fierstein impersonation,

02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:03.360
Waiters missed the list.

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:04.320
I think that might've hurt it.

02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:05.160
That might've hurt.

02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:06.640
You're right, it might've hurt its chances.

02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:09.160
They were raised badly.

02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:10.880
Their mothers didn't do their job.

02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:13.340
All right, so there it is.

02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:16.820
The Xbox lube is the official new title of the Xbox console.

02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:18.440
And here on the show, here in chat,

02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:20.680
and hopefully soon across the entirety of the internet.

02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:22.440
Can we call it the X Blube?

02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:23.680
Sure, we can call it the X Blube

02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:27.760
and other fun creations there will be Xbox lube.

02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:31.040
All right, let's get to last minute stories.

02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:32.080
I don't know, again,

02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:33.680
we were in an interesting situation this week

02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:36.620
because we lost the usual way we prepped the show.

02:35:36.620 --> 02:35:37.880
So does anybody have anything they want to add?

02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:39.560
Dark soccer, were there any stories

02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:41.280
that you wanted to get to that we didn't?

02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:42.520
No, not really.

02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:44.460
Well, actually, hold on, there was one.

02:35:44.460 --> 02:35:45.300
There was one.

02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:46.120
Loki do one.

02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:48.920
Hopefully it's not the same story or you're screwed.

02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:51.000
South Korea has put it into effect

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.640
what they're calling the Cinderella law.

02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:58.040
Basically, they're working with their internet providers

02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:01.320
that they're going to block players from under 16

02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:07.200
from playing between midnight and 6 a.m.

02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:11.000
on online services such as PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.

02:36:12.700 --> 02:36:13.880
What?

02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:15.640
It is in Korea.

02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:18.320
Well, didn't they ban MMOs too?

02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:19.160
Yes, they did.

02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:20.120
Was that South or North that did that?

02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:21.560
South Korea.

02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:23.080
Okay.

02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:25.220
Okay, I've got a couple.

02:36:25.220 --> 02:36:27.960
One of them is that Microsoft bought a video surf

02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:29.560
to use on Xbox Live.

02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:30.800
Interesting, what's video surf do?

02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:32.800
It's a search engine,

02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:37.040
but it's saying that the overtime technology,

02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:39.640
it says it's supposed to be integrated with Xbox Live

02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:43.720
and that you can use it to search for TV film

02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:46.680
across several Xbox Live applications,

02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:49.820
left film, zoom, et cetera.

02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:54.360
The U.S. will, okay, in the UK,

02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:57.380
they're getting BBC content

02:36:57.380 --> 02:37:00.000
and the U.S. will get Bravo, Comcast, HBO Go,

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.480
Verizon, FiOS and sci-fi.

02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:04.400
Wait, wait, wait, we're going to get Bravo?

02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:05.240
Yeah.

02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:07.760
I know, I was like.

02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:11.640
I can't wait for the Real Housewives of,

02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:13.840
you know, Boulder, Colorado

02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:15.560
or wherever they're going to go next.

02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:18.240
And then, you probably said something about this

02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:19.840
on Hoard House.

02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:21.120
Yes, I did, go ahead.

02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:24.100
Yeah, about the talent calculator being live

02:37:24.100 --> 02:37:25.780
for Mista Pandaria.

02:37:25.780 --> 02:37:27.920
Or as I call it, MOP.

02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:30.120
Which is notable because the game itself

02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:32.280
shouldn't be out for at least another six months,

02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:34.000
if not more like nine to 12.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.520
So it's interesting that the talent calculator

02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:36.480
is already out there.

02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:40.940
So you can see how talented you want to be at MOPing.

02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:41.780
There you go.

02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:43.720
Loki?

02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:46.080
Oh, the calculator for Monk is not available.

02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:48.240
Right, because they don't want to give everything away.

02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:49.080
Yeah.

02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:50.920
Loki.

02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:51.760
A few things.

02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:54.500
There was supposed to be a lawsuit against EA

02:37:54.500 --> 02:37:58.960
for reneging on the fact that Battlefield 1943

02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:03.500
didn't come with Battlefield 3 or something like that.

02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:07.280
So now they're going to be giving away.

02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:08.720
The other way around, by the way.

02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:10.040
Whatever.

02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:13.880
They're going to be giving away Battlefield 1943 vouchers

02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:16.680
to everybody that bought the PlayStation 3

02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:18.400
version of Battlefield 3.

02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:21.940
And to redeem this, you have to go to their portal,

02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:26.180
which is 1943redemption.battlefield.com

02:38:26.180 --> 02:38:29.720
with your origin ID and request a download code

02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:30.920
for your region.

02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:33.540
And codes will be available for European customers

02:38:33.540 --> 02:38:36.200
as soon as, well, November 26th.

02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:37.820
So they should already be available.

02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:41.980
And Americans, you'll have to wait until the 10th

02:38:41.980 --> 02:38:45.140
of December before those are available.

02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:49.760
So that's good that they finally came through with that.

02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:51.680
Unfortunately, it took a lot to do that.

02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:53.280
And I'm not sure if we reported on this before,

02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:55.320
but same thing happened with Saints Row the Third.

02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:56.800
They were supposed to be getting an exclusive content

02:38:56.800 --> 02:38:58.200
for Saints Row the Third.

02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:00.360
And THQ came now.

02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:05.360
If you sign up, if you log in your online pass

02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:08.640
that comes with the new copies of Saints Row the Third,

02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:11.280
or if you buy the game and buy the online pass,

02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:13.560
you know, if you buy the game used and buy the online pass,

02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:16.720
as long as you redeem that pass by,

02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:18.120
I forget what the time frame is,

02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:21.800
you get a free copy or a free download of Saints Row 2

02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:24.620
on the PlayStation 3, which is pretty awesome.

02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:27.280
So definitely worth checking that out.

02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:31.080
Cthulhu Saves the World Bundle has sold

02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:33.280
100,000 copies on Steam.

02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:36.560
How many did they sell on Xbox Live Arcade or indie games?

02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:40.400
Indie games, they have only moved 55,000 to date.

02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:46.160
And that's been available since December 2010.

02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:48.520
Sadly, that's still more than I would have thought.

02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:51.060
And, actually, wait a second here.

02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:55.180
I'm sorry, Breath of Death, Breath of Death 7,

02:39:55.180 --> 02:39:59.620
has been available since April 2010 on Xbox Live indie games

02:39:59.620 --> 02:40:02.680
and has moved 55,000 copies to date.

02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:05.400
Cthulhu Saves the World has been available

02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:10.400
since December 2010 and has only generated 20,000 downloads.

02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:11.760
Yikes.

02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:15.560
And apparently, I don't know when it went up on Steam,

02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:20.560
but they sold 100,000 copies.

02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:22.360
Oh, since July.

02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:23.880
July.

02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:25.160
So, yeah.

02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:26.280
Big difference there.

02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:27.960
Apparently their next title that they're working on

02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:32.060
is actually was the once canceled Penny Arcade Adventures

02:40:32.060 --> 02:40:36.240
on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness, episode three.

02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:37.840
Oh, interesting.

02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:39.600
So these guys picked it up.

02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:40.440
Yeah.

02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:42.440
So it's interesting.

02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:47.040
Also, what's also interesting, Elder Scrolls Skyrim

02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:52.040
has much of the, I guess, land of Tamriel from, was it?

02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:57.000
Yeah, there was a video of that up of the guy,

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:57.840
no clipping, right?

02:40:57.840 --> 02:40:59.880
Yeah, from Morrowind.

02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:02.000
And people are assuming that's just from,

02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.720
because the way they display the map or whatever,

02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:07.560
that they just want it to be complete.

02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:10.560
Well, it's still neat either way.

02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:15.280
And of course, Skyrim got a patch on PC,

02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:18.920
but what's kind of annoying is that they added

02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:22.600
mandatory Steam DRM and they've also killed

02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:25.560
some of the tweaks that you can do in the game.

02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:27.180
So that kind of sucks.

02:41:27.180 --> 02:41:31.940
And then last but not least,

02:41:31.940 --> 02:41:34.340
new dashboard update for the Xbox 360

02:41:34.340 --> 02:41:36.220
has been dated for December 6th.

02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:38.200
Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of big news we missed, huh?

02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:41.160
And that of course will be bringing cloud storage

02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:43.420
as well as the beacon support,

02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:46.460
which is I believe live already on Xbox.com.

02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:47.820
Isn't that kind of like the,

02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:50.500
don't you want to play these games with me type of thing?

02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:52.620
Yeah, like you go, hey, I'm playing Call of Duty

02:41:52.620 --> 02:41:54.700
later today, and so you can see that.

02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:55.620
That's kind of cool, I guess.

02:41:55.620 --> 02:41:58.300
Something, so they have that.

02:41:58.300 --> 02:41:59.780
And then also of course the redesign

02:41:59.780 --> 02:42:01.700
to make it look like Windows Phone 7.

02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:04.940
Let's open up the Skype line.

02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:06.220
We're ready to take your calls.

02:42:06.220 --> 02:42:09.780
1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number,

02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:11.300
or you can look us up on Skype.

02:42:11.300 --> 02:42:14.340
Username is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

02:42:14.340 --> 02:42:17.860
877 number is free in the US and Canada, toll free.

02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:19.860
Can't say the same everywhere else,

02:42:19.860 --> 02:42:23.260
so definitely use Skype if you're somewhere else.

02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:25.860
OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, all one word.

02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:28.420
Meanwhile, we have just a couple of tweets for you.

02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:31.140
We didn't get a whole lot tonight, but just a couple.

02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:34.580
We'll start here with a link from TigerClaw on Twitter.

02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:36.420
Send us a reminder.

02:42:36.420 --> 02:42:37.420
I did read about this earlier.

02:42:37.420 --> 02:42:38.440
I didn't make the show roll tonight,

02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:41.100
but he reminds us just in time for Christmas,

02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:44.900
the Batcave will be Arkham City's newest challenge map.

02:42:44.900 --> 02:42:46.680
So there is gonna be some DLC that hits,

02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:48.580
and I think the date was December 20th.

02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:51.060
Yeah, December 20th is gonna be a new DLC pack.

02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:53.220
Of course, this is for Arkham City,

02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:56.020
and it's actually gonna be a Batcave challenge map.

02:42:56.020 --> 02:42:58.820
It's also gonna contain the Iceberg Lounge

02:42:58.820 --> 02:43:00.420
and Joker's Carnival.

02:43:00.420 --> 02:43:03.180
So yeah, that's gonna be coming out December 20th.

02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:06.860
Didn't the Robin pack hit this week?

02:43:06.860 --> 02:43:08.100
Yeah.

02:43:08.100 --> 02:43:09.340
Gotta check that out,

02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:11.900
because yeah, I don't know much about

02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:13.380
what's supposed to be in that Robin pack,

02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:14.580
except well, of course, Robin.

02:43:14.580 --> 02:43:15.540
You can play as Robin.

02:43:15.540 --> 02:43:16.820
Yeah, and they have some challenge maps also.

02:43:16.820 --> 02:43:18.660
I wonder if they integrate him into the story,

02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:19.540
like they do Catwoman.

02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:22.220
I think he's supposed to be integrated into the story.

02:43:22.220 --> 02:43:23.060
That's kind of rad.

02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:24.980
I might have to check that out, so.

02:43:26.420 --> 02:43:29.140
All right, again, the phone is open 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:43:29.140 --> 02:43:32.460
or as your name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:32.460 --> 02:43:35.460
We are getting a call, so let's go to the phones.

02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:36.780
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:36.780 --> 02:43:37.620
Who's this?

02:43:38.660 --> 02:43:40.040
Well, it's Jester Scott.

02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:42.060
Jester Scott, welcome to the show.

02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:44.680
Hi.

02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:46.780
Hi, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:49.620
I had a couple of things.

02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:51.100
I think that you were talking about

02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:54.100
the GameStop stickers one time,

02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:55.480
how they've gotten a little bit better

02:43:55.480 --> 02:43:56.640
from being so sticky.

02:44:00.060 --> 02:44:02.740
Well, I bought Zelda on Sunday, of course,

02:44:02.740 --> 02:44:04.220
I bought the collector's edition,

02:44:04.220 --> 02:44:06.140
and it had this giant sticker on it.

02:44:06.140 --> 02:44:08.180
Oh, wait, okay, wait, you're talking about

02:44:08.180 --> 02:44:10.220
how they will seal up a used,

02:44:10.220 --> 02:44:12.140
or the ones that were opened,

02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:13.860
or like their last copy or whatever,

02:44:13.860 --> 02:44:15.340
with those big stickers,

02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:18.180
and I think you were saying something about this, Loki,

02:44:18.180 --> 02:44:19.580
like you used to be able to kind of

02:44:19.580 --> 02:44:21.700
very carefully take those things off,

02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:22.580
and you could put it back on.

02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:24.000
Somebody was, I think we had a guest,

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:24.840
or somebody was saying something about that.

02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:26.500
No, that wasn't me.

02:44:26.500 --> 02:44:27.700
Maybe it was another podcast,

02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:29.420
but I know I've heard that before.

02:44:29.420 --> 02:44:30.700
So, okay, I see where you're going.

02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:32.500
At first, I was like, GameStop stickers, what?

02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:34.060
Okay, I get where you're going with this.

02:44:34.060 --> 02:44:36.020
Okay, so you just bought Zelda, sorry.

02:44:37.100 --> 02:44:39.760
Right, well, normally the new stickers

02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:41.140
can come off very easily now,

02:44:41.140 --> 02:44:43.460
instead of leaving that sticky residue, right?

02:44:43.460 --> 02:44:44.360
Yeah.

02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:46.500
Well, I go to take off my sticker

02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:49.060
on the Zelda copy that I got.

02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:51.120
Well, the front of it's foil.

02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:52.980
Guess what came off?

02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:53.820
The foil.

02:44:53.820 --> 02:44:54.660
The entire foil.

02:44:54.660 --> 02:44:55.940
The foil came off.

02:44:55.940 --> 02:44:58.860
So the new stickers are not so awesome.

02:44:58.860 --> 02:45:01.020
It's in my eyes anymore.

02:45:01.020 --> 02:45:02.280
Well, you know what that means.

02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:04.060
They were onto our schemes.

02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:05.940
They started reading the internet,

02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:08.100
and they knew that people were just opening them

02:45:08.100 --> 02:45:11.100
and then trying to return them like they were new.

02:45:11.100 --> 02:45:12.060
But you know why?

02:45:12.060 --> 02:45:17.060
They deserve it for that crappy policy anyway, so.

02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:19.700
But whatever.

02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:21.820
I don't even know why mine had a sticker

02:45:21.820 --> 02:45:24.060
on it in the first place, I pre-ordered it.

02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:27.140
Wait, you had actually pre-ordered Zelda

02:45:27.140 --> 02:45:29.560
and you still got a copy like that?

02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:30.400
Yep.

02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:32.460
It wasn't in the shrink wrap?

02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:33.800
Oh, no, no, no.

02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:34.900
It was sealed and everything,

02:45:34.900 --> 02:45:36.620
just still had that big ass sticker

02:45:36.620 --> 02:45:37.820
on the front of the box.

02:45:38.940 --> 02:45:41.620
Oh, so now when you took it off,

02:45:41.620 --> 02:45:43.180
like, now your box has it

02:45:43.180 --> 02:45:46.740
and you won't be able to sell it on eBay or anything, huh?

02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:47.560
No.

02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:48.900
Well, I wasn't gonna sell it anyway.

02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:50.620
It's just an eye store.

02:45:50.620 --> 02:45:53.140
So they had a sticker underneath the shrink wrap?

02:45:54.180 --> 02:45:55.740
No, no, no.

02:45:55.740 --> 02:46:00.740
The box to Zelda has a case inside of the box.

02:46:00.940 --> 02:46:03.300
You're talking about the collector's edition,

02:46:03.300 --> 02:46:05.020
or it had a slip sleeve like the,

02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:07.820
now was it the one with the remote?

02:46:07.820 --> 02:46:11.540
It was kind of like the 25th anniversary for Mario.

02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:13.860
The whole box didn't have a flap.

02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:16.580
I getcha.

02:46:18.020 --> 02:46:19.460
Yeah, the front of that foil

02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:23.460
and the big old sticker they had on it took off the foil.

02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:25.740
Well, let me go this direction

02:46:25.740 --> 02:46:27.900
because you've actually played the new Zelda then,

02:46:27.900 --> 02:46:28.720
which is something,

02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:30.120
despite all the other games that are out right now,

02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:31.540
we haven't had a chance to play.

02:46:31.540 --> 02:46:33.940
How do you like the new Zelda game?

02:46:33.940 --> 02:46:36.300
Oh my God.

02:46:36.300 --> 02:46:38.220
I think it's amazing.

02:46:38.220 --> 02:46:39.460
Yeah?

02:46:39.460 --> 02:46:41.640
Yes, the controls are a little finicky.

02:46:42.740 --> 02:46:43.660
You have to get used to it

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:46.720
because it fully uses the Wii Motion Plus

02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:48.540
or motion controls, whatever it is.

02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:53.540
It goes in a different direction.

02:46:53.540 --> 02:46:55.260
Yes, the graphics are a little toned down,

02:46:55.260 --> 02:46:58.100
but the game is very, very long.

02:46:58.100 --> 02:46:58.940
How do you-

02:46:58.940 --> 02:47:00.140
I've passed 30 hours into it

02:47:00.140 --> 02:47:02.500
and either I really suck

02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:04.740
or this game is extremely long.

02:47:05.940 --> 02:47:09.300
How is it different from Twilight Princess?

02:47:09.300 --> 02:47:10.260
What would you say?

02:47:11.340 --> 02:47:13.660
Well, I didn't play very much of Twilight Princess.

02:47:13.660 --> 02:47:14.820
I know, gamer shame.

02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:20.380
But I don't know.

02:47:20.380 --> 02:47:23.580
It's just like anytime you move your arm

02:47:23.580 --> 02:47:25.920
or anything that,

02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:29.420
any move you make with your Wiimote,

02:47:30.500 --> 02:47:33.220
link on the screen will make that movement.

02:47:33.220 --> 02:47:35.300
And it's kind of funny

02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:39.420
because if you're sitting down playing Zelda

02:47:39.420 --> 02:47:41.860
and he kind of holds his sword out,

02:47:41.860 --> 02:47:43.540
he looks retarded on the screen.

02:47:43.540 --> 02:47:44.900
He's just running around with his sword

02:47:44.900 --> 02:47:46.500
just kind of straight up in the air,

02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:48.500
straight in front of him.

02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:53.020
So, but it will just mimic the movement of your hand,

02:47:53.020 --> 02:47:53.860
literally.

02:47:53.860 --> 02:47:55.900
So it sounds like the Wii Motion Plus

02:47:55.900 --> 02:47:57.380
really added a lot more

02:47:57.380 --> 02:47:59.140
than maybe sometimes we give it credit for.

02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:01.840
The extra technology really kind of added a lot to it.

02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:05.120
Yeah, and I've been reading a little bit of hate

02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:06.360
of that online.

02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:08.880
You know, like, oh, well, but it's Zelda.

02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:10.940
Why can't they just do it for a controller?

02:48:10.940 --> 02:48:12.360
Well, if you think about it,

02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:13.480
with every Zelda game,

02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:15.640
well, nearly every Zelda game,

02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:17.240
they've done something different.

02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:22.160
So, I mean, the first one was that top view.

02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:24.560
The second one had a top view,

02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:26.960
but it would also go into side scrolling.

02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:30.520
So, I mean, just keep going from there.

02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:33.640
Besides, most of the guys playing this game,

02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:35.880
their right hand should be in fine shape anyway

02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:37.480
to wag it around, right?

02:48:38.620 --> 02:48:39.460
Yeah.

02:48:39.460 --> 02:48:40.280
All right.

02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:41.120
Well, buddy, I'm gonna let you go

02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:41.960
so we can get some more calls,

02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:44.780
but thanks so much for the call and enjoy Zelda, okay?

02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:45.620
Oh, that one.

02:48:45.620 --> 02:48:46.680
All right, have a good one.

02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:50.360
Later, 1877 game OLR,

02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:52.240
or a username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.

02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:53.240
I think that was a new caller.

02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:54.400
I don't recognize that name.

02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:55.680
I recognize it from chat right now,

02:48:55.680 --> 02:48:57.880
but I don't think that person's called in before.

02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:00.560
I heard a little Southern accent, didn't you?

02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:01.400
Yeah, a little.

02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:02.220
I heard a little.

02:49:02.220 --> 02:49:03.060
All right.

02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:05.480
Anyhow, moving on, going back to the Twitters.

02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:07.100
Dark Tetsuya sent us a tweet.

02:49:07.100 --> 02:49:11.220
Coming soon to Xbox Live Indie Games, Nyan Cat Adventure.

02:49:11.220 --> 02:49:14.440
It is from the people behind Techno Kitten Adventure.

02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:18.200
I guess they are actually creating a Nyan Cat game.

02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:22.520
There's already a Nyan Cat game for iPhone.

02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:23.400
There is an iPhone,

02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:26.120
but I guess this is the official quote unquote one

02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:29.320
that's going to be on Xbox Live.

02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:30.920
And I like the little box art.

02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:32.180
They have a Facebook

02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:33.980
that has some limited pictures and stuff,

02:49:33.980 --> 02:49:36.440
but I love what they did at the bottom.

02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:39.760
They made this rip off of the Nintendo seal of quality,

02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:43.480
and it's the official Nyan-tendo seal.

02:49:44.780 --> 02:49:47.440
I hope they get that by the Xbox sensors.

02:49:48.420 --> 02:49:49.460
Nyan-tendo.

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:52.960
1877 game OLR,

02:49:52.960 --> 02:49:56.160
or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:00.440
Let's see, more tweets.

02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:03.200
Oh, I like this one from Mantis Knight on Twitter.

02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:08.040
One topic please discuss is,

02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:11.880
is free to play MMORPGs really a good thing?

02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:16.680
Are free to play MMOs really a good thing?

02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:17.580
Hell yes.

02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:20.080
Depends who it's good for.

02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:22.880
As far as being good to get people to try your game,

02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:24.320
yes.

02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:26.640
Whether people try your game

02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:29.160
and then decide to pay for stuff, maybe not.

02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:33.960
I see no problem because I mean,

02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:35.600
I was paying for Star Trek Online

02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:38.000
and then had cryptic points.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.980
So no big there.

02:50:40.980 --> 02:50:42.800
I've heard of where free to play

02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:45.640
has kind of driven games downhill though,

02:50:45.640 --> 02:50:47.480
or at least according to some of the loyal people

02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:48.600
who play the game.

02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:52.020
And like one example I could think of for that

02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:53.320
is Team Fortress 2.

02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:55.820
Now note, I'm not saying Team Fortress 2 is a bad game.

02:50:55.820 --> 02:50:57.320
It's not, it's a good game.

02:50:57.320 --> 02:51:00.080
But some people, you might remember we reported on this,

02:51:00.080 --> 02:51:02.480
when Team Fortress 2 first went free to play,

02:51:02.480 --> 02:51:04.960
the community was very against that.

02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:07.600
Well, some of the community was very against that.

02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:08.540
In fact, they went so far,

02:51:08.540 --> 02:51:11.040
remember there were some servers that would ban you

02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:13.480
if it caught that you were using the free to play version,

02:51:13.480 --> 02:51:15.120
like somehow they could tell the difference.

02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:17.400
And it was like, we don't want these people here.

02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:18.860
And sometimes an MMO is like,

02:51:18.860 --> 02:51:21.340
I can imagine a game like DC Universe.

02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:23.920
Like one day you're paying for DC Universe, right?

02:51:23.920 --> 02:51:25.520
You're paying your $15 a month.

02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:27.800
Suddenly the game goes free to play.

02:51:27.800 --> 02:51:30.840
Now your servers are drowning under all the people

02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:32.400
that are trying to get on the server.

02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:34.400
And it's like, where it might be a good thing

02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:36.300
that more people are playing your game.

02:51:36.300 --> 02:51:38.580
Now it's all these people who didn't pay anything to get in.

02:51:38.580 --> 02:51:41.080
So it's kind of like they might be ruining the party

02:51:41.080 --> 02:51:41.920
a little bit.

02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:42.740
Does that make sense?

02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:46.000
What if they, what if these companies

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.600
actually did have a pay only server?

02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:50.800
Or you know, like an old school server

02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:53.120
or like new servers just for new people or something.

02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:54.560
That could be a way to get around it.

02:51:54.560 --> 02:51:55.720
We'll come back to this topic in a minute,

02:51:55.720 --> 02:51:56.720
but first we have another call.

02:51:56.720 --> 02:51:57.760
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:51:57.760 --> 02:51:58.600
Who's this?

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.480
Hey, this is Cloud of Cleveland.

02:52:02.480 --> 02:52:03.320
Cloud Cleveland?

02:52:03.320 --> 02:52:04.680
I haven't been in a chat for a long time.

02:52:04.680 --> 02:52:06.080
Hey, well, what's up buddy?

02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:08.200
Yo, bro.

02:52:08.200 --> 02:52:10.840
Hey, Rob, you are a Rez fan, right?

02:52:10.840 --> 02:52:11.760
For the old Dreamcast?

02:52:11.760 --> 02:52:13.020
Frickin' love Rez.

02:52:13.020 --> 02:52:14.720
Happy 10 year anniversary.

02:52:14.720 --> 02:52:16.280
Hell yeah.

02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:17.120
I know, right?

02:52:17.120 --> 02:52:18.840
Have you gotten to play Child of Eden yet?

02:52:18.840 --> 02:52:19.680
I do.

02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:20.840
I have played Child of Eden.

02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:22.200
Child of Eden, I want to play it

02:52:22.200 --> 02:52:25.060
on the PlayStation 3 for real.

02:52:25.060 --> 02:52:27.980
I liked it, but I thought the Kinect control

02:52:27.980 --> 02:52:28.820
was a little weird.

02:52:28.820 --> 02:52:30.400
It was like cool to play once,

02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:32.900
but I prefer just playing it with a controller.

02:52:32.900 --> 02:52:35.480
And I didn't like the music as much as I liked Rez.

02:52:35.480 --> 02:52:37.680
I really didn't, but it was still a good game.

02:52:37.680 --> 02:52:40.240
I couldn't let people say that actually about the music.

02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:42.160
It just, you know, I mean, it's not that it was bad.

02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:43.200
It wasn't bad by anything means.

02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:44.560
And I'm always going to love anything

02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:49.920
Tetsuya Mizuguchi puts out, but it wasn't Rez.

02:52:49.920 --> 02:52:53.560
And the price was tough to swallow,

02:52:53.560 --> 02:52:57.280
but you know, there's a lot of weird stuff

02:52:57.280 --> 02:52:58.400
that comes out for a high price.

02:52:58.400 --> 02:53:01.400
Like, at least it was better than five cars

02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:02.920
and three tracks.

02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:05.320
It was a better game than that, that's for sure.

02:53:06.820 --> 02:53:08.700
Okay, maybe I'll wait for it to go budget title

02:53:08.700 --> 02:53:10.200
before I actually pick it up myself.

02:53:10.200 --> 02:53:11.520
Well, there's a lot of Black Friday videos.

02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:12.640
My gosh, dude.

02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:17.640
I would say, my God, Mario 3D Land.

02:53:19.260 --> 02:53:22.740
You know, between that and Kirby Return to Dream Land,

02:53:22.740 --> 02:53:24.940
those two games have really put a lot of faith

02:53:24.940 --> 02:53:26.620
into Nintendo for me.

02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:28.960
Isn't it funny how the entire internet,

02:53:28.960 --> 02:53:31.260
and this show included, or at least myself,

02:53:31.260 --> 02:53:33.500
I can't speak for the other two,

02:53:33.500 --> 02:53:37.080
but it's so interesting the love-hate relationship

02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:37.920
we have with Nintendo,

02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:39.520
is that sometimes we look at the decisions they make

02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:41.260
and we go, you guys are idiots.

02:53:41.260 --> 02:53:42.840
Like, why are you doing this?

02:53:42.840 --> 02:53:45.100
Why don't you understand online?

02:53:45.100 --> 02:53:46.580
You know, how many years has it been?

02:53:46.580 --> 02:53:48.300
God damn, friend codes?

02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:50.500
Why do we always hurt the ones we love?

02:53:50.500 --> 02:53:53.460
Right, but then they go and they put out

02:53:53.460 --> 02:53:57.040
fucking Mario 3D Land, this Kirby game,

02:53:57.040 --> 02:53:59.480
which I hear is really good, Zelda,

02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:04.280
and supposedly, assuming Mario Kart 7 is just as good,

02:54:04.280 --> 02:54:07.740
it's like, damn, we got a lot of good games all at once,

02:54:07.740 --> 02:54:11.220
and oh shit, the golden rule of gaming really is

02:54:11.220 --> 02:54:13.720
a system is only as good as the games that are on it,

02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:15.860
and you have to take a step back and say,

02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:18.040
well shit, these are some really good games,

02:54:18.040 --> 02:54:21.460
so despite all the bonehead moves Nintendo makes sometimes,

02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:24.280
sometimes when it's right, it's really right.

02:54:25.860 --> 02:54:28.360
Oh no, I mean, now it's completely worth having to weave

02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:30.560
for me, I've actually pulled it out of my closet

02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:32.460
just to be able to play these games,

02:54:32.460 --> 02:54:36.000
and thankfully, the 3DS didn't have to wait as long

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:37.300
for some decent games,

02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:39.720
and hopefully this won't be the end of it.

02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:41.860
Yeah, it's interesting, there's been other stories

02:54:41.860 --> 02:54:44.280
this week that Reggie is saying that just because

02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:45.820
the Wii U is coming out does not mean

02:54:45.820 --> 02:54:47.580
the Wii's life cycle is done,

02:54:47.580 --> 02:54:49.420
and I think a lot of us are looking at that

02:54:49.420 --> 02:54:50.700
with kind of one eyebrow raised,

02:54:50.700 --> 02:54:53.020
like, how are the systems going to coexist?

02:54:53.020 --> 02:54:55.520
And I think you kind of have to say that to some extent,

02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:57.540
because you don't want the Wiis to stop selling

02:54:57.540 --> 02:55:01.140
this holiday season, I still think Xenoblade's

02:55:01.140 --> 02:55:04.540
gonna come out, I think that, hmm,

02:55:04.540 --> 02:55:05.700
I always go back and forth with this,

02:55:05.700 --> 02:55:08.020
I swore up and down that if they didn't announce

02:55:08.020 --> 02:55:10.000
it at Penny Arcade, it wasn't fucking happening,

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:11.380
but I'm kind of like, you know,

02:55:11.380 --> 02:55:13.840
what else do they fucking have next year?

02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:16.160
They've gotta have almost all of their people

02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:19.440
working on making the Wii U better,

02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:21.480
because it's gotta be better at next year's E3,

02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:23.500
I think you're gonna see a much different system

02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:26.680
next year's E3, and I don't mean like,

02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:28.600
suddenly it's not gonna have a touchscreen anymore,

02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:30.020
any of that stuff, I just mean,

02:55:30.020 --> 02:55:31.520
you're gonna definitely see the games,

02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:33.160
you're gonna see the reason why Nintendo

02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:35.000
really believes in this, you're gonna see this E3,

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:38.440
is that they can't prove that, that system is fucked.

02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:43.440
But I think because they've got all their people

02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:46.540
working to make the Wii U great,

02:55:46.540 --> 02:55:49.860
they're kinda keeping this backlog of Wii things

02:55:49.860 --> 02:55:51.920
that they can release through 2012,

02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:54.600
and that's what I think has happened to the last story

02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:56.840
and Xenoblade and all these rainfall games,

02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:59.280
is that I think you're gonna slowly see them

02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:01.960
trickle out through 2012, because Nintendo

02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:04.560
can't afford to work on anything for the Wii right now,

02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:06.280
yet at the same time, they can't afford

02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:07.720
to just let the Wii die.

02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:10.520
So they don't wanna blow their load this holiday season.

02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:13.920
They've gotta let it kinda trickle out through 2012.

02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:17.340
So I think you still will see those games come out.

02:56:17.340 --> 02:56:19.060
Will the people that are so diehard

02:56:19.060 --> 02:56:21.160
on Operation Rainfall still give a damn?

02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:23.560
Because I'll tell you from first-hand experience,

02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:26.520
it's really easy to download Xenoblade from the internet

02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:28.280
and play it on your Wii right now.

02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:30.960
Like, you don't have to do a hardware modification to it.

02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:33.920
So will the internet collectively still care

02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:35.200
this time next year?

02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:38.200
That's, because especially a game like Xenoblade

02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:39.500
is really for the core gamer.

02:56:39.500 --> 02:56:41.340
You can't sell Xenoblade to a soccer mom

02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:42.920
with her seven-year-olds.

02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:44.500
But Xenoblade is a really good game

02:56:44.500 --> 02:56:46.700
that if you do own a Wii, you should check out.

02:56:47.980 --> 02:56:48.820
So.

02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:49.720
All right, I won't actually look into that one.

02:56:49.720 --> 02:56:50.640
Thanks for the suggestion.

02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:52.880
No problem, except for you,

02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:54.440
unless you happen to be in Europe,

02:56:54.440 --> 02:56:56.880
you won't find it here, or you're gonna have to turn

02:56:56.880 --> 02:56:59.360
to the dark side of the internet,

02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:00.840
which SOPA may eliminate.

02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:04.160
So get it now while you still can.

02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:05.720
Yeah, I hope not.

02:57:05.720 --> 02:57:07.960
I don't usually advocate piracy,

02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:10.040
but when the company leaves you no other choice

02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:12.520
to play the game, I don't know what else to tell people.

02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:13.760
Xenoblade's a great game.

02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:18.200
Yeah, you know, if you can't get the licensing

02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:22.080
in your country or whatever, you know, other options, man.

02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:23.440
Yep, so.

02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:25.280
All right, well, anything else you want to ask

02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:27.500
or get out with the show tonight?

02:57:28.900 --> 02:57:30.140
No, that's about it, bro.

02:57:30.140 --> 02:57:31.520
All right, well, thanks so much for your call,

02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:33.480
and have fun with Child of Eden.

02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:34.760
You should get it when it,

02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:36.440
you're gonna see a lot of good sales through the holidays.

02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:37.800
So definitely check it out.

02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:39.960
Right.

02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:40.780
All right, take care, buddy.

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:45.040
1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype

02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:47.640
is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:50.080
Love to hear from you.

02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:51.480
Did I finish all the tweets or was there one of them?

02:57:51.480 --> 02:57:53.680
Oh, we were still on the free-to-play thing.

02:57:53.680 --> 02:57:54.740
We were talking about that.

02:57:54.740 --> 02:57:56.480
And Dark Soccer, you were talking about

02:57:56.480 --> 02:57:58.380
that you kind of, even your experiences,

02:57:58.380 --> 02:58:02.240
you know, the Star Wars, or Star Trek, thank you.

02:58:02.240 --> 02:58:03.080
I really should know better.

02:58:03.080 --> 02:58:04.920
But it would just be certain things that I would want,

02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:06.760
and they would be very reasonable.

02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:10.600
Like, I could get a thing of the lowest end

02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:12.240
of Cryptic Point or something,

02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:15.820
and it would last me through, like, months of releases.

02:58:15.820 --> 02:58:16.660
Yeah.

02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:17.840
So.

02:58:17.840 --> 02:58:19.200
All right.

02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:20.480
Since the phone's not ringing again,

02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:21.660
I think we're actually gonna shut it down,

02:58:21.660 --> 02:58:22.500
because believe it or not,

02:58:22.500 --> 02:58:23.960
this has been a long show tonight,

02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:25.640
especially considering our website is down

02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:27.600
and we weren't able to do a proper show roll.

02:58:27.600 --> 02:58:29.160
We did a good job filling time.

02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:30.700
So we gotta wrap up.

02:58:30.700 --> 02:58:32.760
That was it for the tweets, too.

02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:35.400
And we gotta get everybody's final thoughts

02:58:35.400 --> 02:58:36.260
before we wrap up.

02:58:36.260 --> 02:58:38.480
I think we already did last-minute stories.

02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:42.560
So let's get everybody's last-minute thoughts.

02:58:42.560 --> 02:58:45.680
My final thought tonight is I'm excited to go home

02:58:45.680 --> 02:58:47.800
and eat, yay, food, I love food.

02:58:47.800 --> 02:58:49.040
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:58:49.040 --> 02:58:52.600
Making good headway on Call of Duty formatting.

02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:53.920
And last but not least, Dark Soccer,

02:58:53.920 --> 02:58:54.760
your final thought tonight?

02:58:54.760 --> 02:58:56.760
My night is far from over.

02:58:56.760 --> 02:58:58.000
Woo-hoo!

02:58:58.000 --> 02:58:58.820
All right.

02:58:58.820 --> 02:59:00.600
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show

02:59:00.600 --> 02:59:01.880
and tuning into Orange Laundry Radio.

02:59:01.880 --> 02:59:03.160
We really appreciate your support.

02:59:03.160 --> 02:59:06.560
Hey, especially when poopy things happen to us,

02:59:06.560 --> 02:59:09.400
like, you know, our internet goes out

02:59:09.400 --> 02:59:11.440
so we can't do a show one week randomly,

02:59:11.440 --> 02:59:14.640
or, you know, our website suddenly goes down.

02:59:14.640 --> 02:59:16.880
We really appreciate that you guys stand by with us.

02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:18.080
Even though I know the podcasties

02:59:18.080 --> 02:59:18.920
will be a little bit behind,

02:59:18.920 --> 02:59:21.640
we still had a very full chat room tonight,

02:59:21.640 --> 02:59:24.000
and I really appreciate that, all things considered.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:25.080
Considering we don't have a website

02:59:25.080 --> 02:59:26.640
where you can go to chat.orangelaundryradio.com

02:59:26.640 --> 02:59:27.480
or any of that.

02:59:27.480 --> 02:59:29.560
So, really appreciate you guys.

02:59:29.560 --> 02:59:30.840
If you like what you heard,

02:59:30.840 --> 02:59:32.280
we're not begging for your money.

02:59:32.280 --> 02:59:35.320
All we ask, tell people about the show, word of mouth.

02:59:36.440 --> 02:59:38.640
Help spread the word about the show.

02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:41.120
Tell a person who may not have heard of it about the show,

02:59:41.120 --> 02:59:42.760
and help the O.L. Army grow.

02:59:42.760 --> 02:59:47.360
And we can spread the word, the term of Xbox lube,

02:59:47.360 --> 02:59:49.880
throughout the universe.

02:59:49.880 --> 02:59:52.320
That's gonna do it for another week of Orange Laundry Radio.

02:59:52.320 --> 02:59:54.440
We'll be back next week, hopefully with a website

02:59:54.440 --> 02:59:55.880
and everything to do it all over again

02:59:55.880 --> 02:59:57.360
with next week in gaming news.

02:59:57.360 --> 03:00:01.000
And I'm sure even more games to be played this week,

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.040
including, it sounds like Mario Kart 7,

03:00:03.920 --> 03:00:07.240
but in a couple, by this time next week, right?

03:00:07.240 --> 03:00:09.400
The fourth, oh my God.

03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:11.840
So much more coming, so we'll be back next week.

03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:14.320
Until then, have a great week.

03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:16.680
And don't be a dick to each other online.

03:00:16.680 --> 03:00:19.920
