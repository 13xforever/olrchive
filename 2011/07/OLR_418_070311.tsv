0	19160	Tonight, July 3rd, 2011, online videos may soon make you a criminal, Nintendo spends
19160	24000	big bucks on a new facility, and an early build of an anticipated 360 game leaks to
24000	31560	the internet.
31560	34440	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34440	38120	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38120	43200	We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com as we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock
43200	47040	Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
47040	51240	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts,
51240	54520	first off, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
54520	55520	Mar.
55520	56520	How are you?
56520	57520	Mar mar mar.
57520	58520	Mars?
58520	59520	Are you offering me a Mars bar?
59520	60520	No.
60520	61520	I love British chocolate.
61520	65320	I was thinking, well you can get a Snickers Dark and it's the same thing.
65320	68200	I was, it just popped into my head about Seaman.
68200	69320	Mar mar mar.
69320	71400	One of the things a little Seaman says.
71400	74520	So you're thinking about Seaman at the top of the show.
74520	75520	Man.
75520	76520	Okay, I see.
76520	79080	I also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
79080	80080	Hi.
80080	81080	How are you, Loki?
81080	82080	Good.
82080	83080	All right.
83080	86000	Well, we're going to get into, of course, all the good stuff we like to do at the top
86000	87000	of the show.
87000	88200	How was your gaming week and so forth.
88200	91240	But I'm going to start off tonight's show with a bang and it's going to be in our chat
91240	98720	room, chat.orangelaunge, if I even knew our website, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
98720	102680	I'm going to give away one of my birthday presents right here, live on air, starting
102680	105280	off the show tonight because I love the listeners that much.
105280	107300	I'm going to share my birthday with you guys.
107300	111200	It's an Xbox 360 game, so I'm going to give it to one of you guys in chat.
111200	117080	So all I need you to do is whoever wants it in the chat room, say, I want Rob's 360 game.
117080	118080	You just type that out.
118080	119280	I want Rob's 360 game.
119280	120320	You only say it once.
120320	122960	If you say it more than once, you've disqualified yourself.
122960	126320	At the end, we'll pick a number one through whatever of how many of you said, I want Rob's
126320	127320	360 game.
127320	129960	And we are going to give it away right here at the top of the show this week.
129960	132840	I'll tell you more about what it is after our gaming week.
132840	135920	See, that's what we do is a little thing called a radio tease.
135920	136920	It's yours.
136920	137920	It's not yours.
137920	141320	I can say with a clean conscience is not yours.
141320	145800	It is something I received from my birthday on the 360 and I'm giving it away, but you
145800	146800	know what?
146800	147800	We're a sweeten the pot a little bit.
147800	149840	Not only are we going to give it away, I'm going to sign it.
149840	151320	So is Dark Soccer and Loki.
151320	155680	So it's going to be like a autographed sign it with my butt and Dark Soccer will sign
155680	156680	it with her butt.
156680	157680	No.
157680	158680	All right.
158680	159680	Yep.
159680	160680	Give it away.
160680	161680	Give it away now.
161680	162680	All right.
162680	163680	Moving on.
163680	164680	Let's start off.
164680	165680	How was your gaming week?
165680	169720	I, um, played WoW.
169720	175400	I got 50 mounts today, so now I have an albino drake.
175400	182680	So it has a skin condition and, uh, that's about it.
182680	183680	Next.
183680	184680	Lol.
184680	185760	You're addicted to WoW.
185760	186760	Your fault.
186760	187760	All right.
187760	189200	Uh, then Loki, how was your gaming week?
189200	191480	Have you been playing anything like that's not WoW?
191480	197400	Of course I haven't been playing WoW, because I don't get WoW and nor would I want to play
197400	198400	WoW.
198400	204240	Um, no, I played more Grand Theft Auto this week, um, same old stuff.
204240	208040	And then of course Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon, because it's awesome.
208040	213400	I got that early this week and was able to play through quite a bit of it and, um, I'm
213400	218320	happy to say it exceeds my expectations in every possible way.
218320	224720	It is, it's just basically, you know, a very polished version of, like, Earth Defense Force
224720	233060	2017, um, done in the U.S. and, you know, they've taken a lot of stuff that people like
233060	236760	from other shooters and stuff kind of incorporated into the game.
236760	242380	Um, everything seems to be more action-packed, missions seem a little bit longer, and, um,
242380	243740	it's just, it's very fun.
243740	246280	And the multiplayer over the internet's actually pretty fun.
246280	252480	I've been playing a few games, uh, because I picked up a few copies of it, um, between
252480	254800	my coworkers and it was pretty cool.
254800	258400	Tried to play some games over the weekend, though, and was unable to connect to my other
258400	264120	coworker that has it, but, uh, yeah, I'm definitely digging this game and highly recommend you
264120	265120	pick it up.
265120	271280	I mean, it's, depending on where you go, it may be out yesterday or out on Tuesday, um,
271280	274520	there's an interesting story behind that, too.
274520	281920	But, yeah, so, it's, it's really fun, um, you know, graphics and sound are pretty good,
281920	286240	uh, I mean, especially when you're comparing them to Earth Defense Force, you know, the
286240	292080	first one, it's just night and day, um, I mean, there's a little bit of slowdown, some
292080	295960	of your AI are kind of dumb, but they're actually, uh, pretty smart this time around, they actually
295960	300520	do a lot of work and they don't die as, you know, quite often, because you have a three-man
300520	306240	team the entire time, whether it be with players or AI, and, uh, the different suits you can
306240	312840	try out, those are kind of cool, um, but overall, it's just a great, great game, and I really,
312840	316600	I love playing, in fact, I'll be playing some of it during the show, because that's what
316600	317600	I do.
317600	320880	Uh, be careful, though, you don't want to stream it anywhere to the internet, because
320880	326320	you might get arrested for that, but we'll get into that later in the show.
326320	329920	So, how does this game outshine the original?
329920	330920	How's it outshine the original?
330920	335680	Well, the original was really, really, really buggy, and just really cheap, but it was fun
335680	339160	because you're fighting a bunch of different things all at once.
339160	343640	This one kind of ramps up everything, the graphics are better, um, you know, the detail
343640	348560	in the game, like destroying buildings and stuff, it's not just, you know, kind of breaking
348560	353680	apart and falling, I mean, they still do that, but there's a lot more ways you can interact,
353680	357760	it breaks up the gameplay quite a bit, um, you know, you have the standard just running
357760	362280	around shooting stuff, and then you have, like, parts where you're in a, you know, drop
362280	367720	ship and you're manning, uh, you know, auto cannons off the side of that, or you're inside
367720	372120	of a turret, or you're in the mechs, which, by the way, the rideable vehicles that they
372120	376560	have in this game aren't terrible, like the first game, where they had just these mechs
376560	381920	that moved super fucking slow, and were weak, and you just, it was kind of pointless to
381920	386880	be inside of them, um, but this time, though, the mechs are actually pretty awesome, uh,
386880	392880	the tank is really cool, and the turrets are pretty fun to play around with, uh, sound
392880	398960	is actually really good in it, um, I thought, you know, it was just really action packed,
398960	403520	um, just all the missions, seeing the, like, oh, here, you're gonna be attacked by these
403520	407640	things, oh, and now here's this thing coming in, oh, and some drop ships just came in,
407640	412680	and they're gonna be, uh, making your life hell, it's just, it's really overwhelming,
412680	418240	and, uh, yet without being too difficult, and although I am playing on the normal mode
418240	422000	right now, because I'm starting everything off normal, then going through the hard, and
422000	429160	then the inferno, which is just insane, um, it is ramping up difficulty pretty fast, and,
429160	433960	uh, you know, that's the thing, in each mission, whereas the first game, the missions were
433960	438040	pretty short, and they had, like, 73 of them, this one, the missions have different, like,
438040	443720	waypoints, different, um, things going on, and as, uh, they have, kind of, the game broken
443720	448800	up in the chapters with different, uh, bits of the story going on, uh, like, right now,
448800	453880	this part, I'm retrieving a package with it, ended up being some sort of alien bomb, and
453880	458520	then I had to take out some sort of queen ant thing, and that's where I died last, but,
458520	461920	uh, it's just, it's very, very action packed.
461920	465560	Let's go to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, the ever present, present fourth guest here
465560	469800	on Orange Launch Radio, uh, sha100matt says, I played Earth Defense Force 2 at PAX East,
469800	474080	and it really just reminded me of the next gen version of the N64 game of Body Harvest.
474080	476760	I sadly didn't like it as much as Loki likes it.
476760	479000	Uh, Brakeman says, wait, what's going on here?
479000	481240	Loki actually likes a game?
481240	482240	So you don't...
482240	483900	I like games all the time.
483900	487960	This isn't really one that you hear about a lot, though, and clearly you're biased towards
487960	491920	this series, you really enjoyed the first one, you like this, you're not being paid
491920	493640	under the table by these folks, right?
493640	494640	No.
494640	498680	And you actually spilled the news on this a long time ago, didn't you?
498680	499680	Yes.
499680	500680	I seem to recall.
500680	503040	Because I, I look for this, I'm like, whooo, whooo, whooo, whooo.
503040	504040	You're the only one who cares.
504040	505040	Exactly.
505040	506040	I was like, this is kinda...
506040	509720	Why do you think you, you know, and, and that happens in gaming sometimes.
509720	513560	Sometimes we like a game that nobody else sees to like for unexplainable reasons.
513560	515080	Why are you so drawn to this freaking game?
515080	516080	It's just fun.
516080	520880	It's, it's kinda taking games back to where, what the focus should be in any game.
520880	526360	It's not about the great, great graphics or, you know, making sure everything's cinematic
526360	527520	and has a great story.
527520	529040	It's all about being fun.
529040	530040	And that's what this is.
530040	533360	This is basically like a popcorn action flick or something like that.
533360	536480	The story, yeah, there's somewhat of a story there, but who gives a shit?
536480	540800	It's just, you know, just there to move, move the game up.
540800	541800	Yeah, exactly.
541800	546360	It's basically, you know, you're going crazy, there's all these, you know, different bugs
546360	550480	coming, and they even poke fun at everything, I mean, because they're like, they're all
550480	551480	yes.
551480	555880	This, because they call the aliens Ravagers, they're all, yes, this Ravager we've named
555880	559960	Daddy Longlegs because it looks like a Daddy Longlegs spider.
559960	565200	He's like, I know, it's our intelligence doesn't have a better name for it, but, you know,
565200	566200	that's what we're calling it.
566200	571880	And they have like a, there was a part where I got picked up by this one, this one dropship
571880	573260	in the pilot.
573260	579120	He's just being, doing all the like really typical, and yes, off to the left, you'll
579120	585520	see here, there's a giant swarm of enemy, you know, and it's attacking, and you'll notice
585520	591200	that our, that we'll be cruising at an altitude of, you know, it just like, the really-
591200	592720	That's kind of like Starship Troopers.
592720	597120	It is very much like Starship Troopers, just without all the, you know, propaganda in there.
597120	601080	I mean, it's very, I don't know, it's fun.
601080	606440	If you tried the first game and you thought, oh my god, this game is like a piece of shit
606440	609640	as far as, you know, and granted, the first game had no physics whatsoever.
609640	614080	I mean, you could fall from a helicopter in space and land on the ground and be just fine.
614080	617280	I mean, there is no anything.
617280	622280	And you know, the spaceships, when they crash, they just kind of slowly sink through the
622280	625640	ground and you could be in the path of one of them and it just clips right through you
625640	626640	and stuff.
626640	630200	Well, this one, I mean, the actual ships when they crash, I mean, they will take out buildings
630200	635240	and they will, they explode and they will possibly kill you if you're too close to it.
635240	639080	Or like the enemy kind of spaceships that are flying around, if you're shooting them
639080	643200	and they get damaged enough, they will actually try to kamikaze into you and try to destroy
643200	644200	you that way.
644200	646560	But it's just, it's ridiculous fun.
646560	647760	That's all it is.
647760	649880	It's a great game.
649880	653320	And really, I mean, when you look at it in the month of July, there's not a lot coming
653320	654320	out anyways.
654320	658960	If you're not a fan of football, then you're left with Harry Potter and Call of Juarez,
658960	659960	you know, the cartel.
659960	662200	What you hear is kind of terrible.
662200	665320	Tigerclaw in our chat room says, at least it's not Grand Theft Auto IV, which is all
665320	666320	he ever plays.
666320	667320	You know what?
667320	668320	True that.
668320	673480	I'm excited to hear Loki give an in-depth review to something else on the show for once.
673480	676160	All right.
676160	679760	So Dan just walked in without a mic interrupting the show saying that Shadows of the Damned
679760	680760	is fucking hilarious.
680760	681760	It is a fun game.
681760	684860	I've, I've heard this is kind of a, I haven't played it at all, but I've heard it's kind
684860	686000	of fun too.
686000	688440	It's amazing.
688440	694300	It's a road trip movie, a road trip movie game in hell, basically.
694300	700420	It's like very Grindhouse-ish, but it's just, I don't know, insane.
700420	702120	This is why people want to ban these games.
702120	703120	All right.
703120	704980	Uh, let's move on to my gaming week.
704980	707920	First off, before I get to the contest, which I know you're all eagerly awaiting to see
707920	710680	who won the contest, let me tell you about my gaming week because I did play some new
710680	711920	games this week.
711920	713040	First game I'm going to tell you about.
713040	717800	On a whim, I was at Fry's the other day because I had to buy a new headset for my computer
717800	720400	because my fat ass sat down on my old ones.
720400	726240	Don't ask how I do that, but uh, yeah, I bought a new headset, but I saw on the shelf for
726240	733120	40 bucks, I saw a copy of Dance Dance Revolution on the Xbox 360, which is the brand new one.
733120	735160	This is the reboot, quote unquote, of DDR.
735160	740200	They had the brand new game and dance pad for 40 bucks and I was like, well, you know,
740200	741320	how bad could this possibly be?
741320	742320	I like DDR.
742320	746600	I, you know, obviously, OLR was built on DDR and all that, so why not?
746600	748000	I'm going to buy this game.
748000	753920	And I took it home and played it for a little while and I was sad because it is horrible.
753920	756480	It is a step backward for the genre.
756480	760840	It is just a terrible, terrible version of DDR.
760840	766320	It is, and big parts of that I can really blame on the song list.
766320	770660	Um, you know, I was excited when I read the back of the box and saw that Lady Gaga was
770660	773680	in it and yes, there is a Gaga song in it and that's pretty cool.
773680	778600	Then there's some of the Japanese DDR songs that you've come to expect, except I would
778600	784240	say 75 percent of them were Naoki or one of his other incarnations, which, you know, back
784240	789720	when Max, Max 2, Extreme, all of that was out, it wasn't so dominated by Naoki.
789720	794520	I mean, granted, he's always been a huge presence in DDR, but not this bad.
794520	796700	But then you look at some of the other licensed songs they pick.
796700	798280	I kid you not.
798280	802120	There's a Leona Lewis song in there because when I think dance, I think a slow jam by
802120	803320	Leona Lewis.
803320	808000	There was a train song in there, I think Drops of Jupiter or something, I don't know.
808000	809800	I can't even remember the names of their songs.
809800	813320	They all sound the same to me, the guy whines like he has a vagine.
813320	818000	And then the song that just made me want to crinkle up my dance pad and throw it out the
818000	821880	window, Need You Now by Lady Antebellum.
821880	828920	That's right, that slow jam song, country, western music somehow is appropriate for DDR.
828920	831380	And I was just like, I died inside.
831380	833120	So the song list is terrible.
833120	835440	The interface is set up like a, what?
835440	836440	No wonder it was 30 bucks.
836440	837440	It was 40.
837440	838440	You overpaid.
838440	839440	What's that?
839440	843440	You overpaid.
843440	844440	I like this.
844440	849360	Islander in our chat says, was Rob trying to sign his computer headphones with his butt?
849360	852540	Apparently, apparently.
852540	856760	I mean, it's not just the song list that's offensive, but the interface is just crap.
856760	858080	Like there's really nothing to it.
858080	861000	The videos are just very generic videos.
861000	863760	They didn't even like, it's just like, they didn't even try.
863760	867820	And when you put this game next to the universe games on DDR, which granted at the time they
867820	870600	came out, were just kind of okay.
870600	875320	Now you don't realize how good those fucking games were compared to this.
875320	879960	Like I actually, I've got the most value out of this game using the dance pad because my
879960	881440	old one was long destroyed.
881440	885120	I've been using the dance pad to go back and play DDR universe one and two.
885120	886120	That is what I've been using.
886120	888600	I have two of those dance pads that are still folded up.
888600	889920	I never actually use them.
889920	895860	They're still folded up in my closet because I got, way back in the day when we actually
895860	900480	used to get free shit from publishers at my work.
900480	905960	I got a couple of the dance bundles and I played the games and yeah, I didn't really
905960	906960	care for them.
906960	907960	I sold those.
907960	910680	I kept the dance pads because hey, you never know when you might need a dance pad or might
910680	915720	need to hack one apart to, you know, make a DDR heart pad.
915720	920440	Yeah, I'm going to our chat, my chat that orange knows radio.com.
920440	922040	I have an issue with websites tonight.
922040	926160	Tiger class says, so what sky is trying to say, DDR three 60 is an abomination.
926160	927320	Uh, yes.
927320	930360	And don't forget, this is the same game that's on the PS three only.
930360	931520	It has moved support.
931520	935920	So whoopee, you get to wave your arms to wait, wait, but this has vision camera support.
935920	939040	If it does, I don't know where it is because I didn't see an option for it.
939040	941800	I thought that does the connect not read the same way as a vision cam.
941800	942800	Yes, it should.
942800	943800	They should.
943800	946760	If it's in there, I didn't find it, I really didn't give a shit.
946760	948520	Um, and it's also on the Wii.
948520	949520	And here's the hilarious part.
949520	953080	If you look up videos of the Wii version, the Wii version actually kind of looks like
953080	954480	the arcade versions.
954480	958780	I'm saying the Wii versions interface looks better than the three 60 and presumably PS
958780	960200	three versions.
960200	966400	So you explain that one to me, all these weird combo things that are supposed to add points.
966400	967580	I didn't even understand.
967580	973540	And then the mode where you unlock stuff is the club mode, which is just nonstop mode.
973540	977720	So that the songs come nonstop and occasionally the difficulty will just randomly change in
977720	980380	the song or the arrows will move faster, slower.
980380	986840	And then unexplainably, the way you unlock songs is you gain meters on songs that you
986840	987840	do well in.
987840	991200	But if you miss steps, then you don't get as much because the difficulty would, I can't
991200	992280	even fucking explain it.
992280	995140	Like this game is just poopy, poopy, caca, terrible.
995140	998720	And it makes me sad as somebody who liked DDR so much.
998720	1002640	It is time for the Dance Dance Revolution franchise to be revoked from Konami.
1002640	1006480	They no longer deserve to have that franchise based on this game.
1006480	1012040	I truly believe that somehow some divine being needs to come into Konami.
1012040	1015880	I don't know how this happens, but somehow there needs to be a legal decision.
1015880	1021000	The Supreme court should be involved in a seven, two decision to revoke DDR from Konami.
1021000	1022000	Yes.
1022000	1023000	I realize they're a Japanese company.
1023000	1024000	I don't care.
1024000	1027200	It's like somehow that needs to happen where they are no longer allowed to make Dance Dance
1027200	1028200	Revolution.
1028200	1029200	Give it to me.
1029200	1037320	I'll, I'll, I'll, you know, clothe it, you know, take it in, give it some shelter.
1037320	1042200	So anyhow, by the way, by the way, while I was playing that random nonstop mode, guess
1042200	1046160	what awesome DDR jam started playing?
1046160	1047160	Like, yeah.
1047160	1051560	Uh, because you know, sometimes there's, um, you know, there's these, there's the, the
1051560	1055600	American songs you would expect to cross over, like some of the eighties classics, like,
1055600	1058200	uh, you know, walk like an Egyptian and so forth.
1058200	1061200	But Oh man, I just couldn't believe my ears.
1061200	1065680	I always thought this was such a, uh, great dance song and I've always wanted to play
1065680	1078520	this in DDR step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, die.
1078520	1079520	Who is this?
1079520	1088080	Oh, I don't listen to her because when I hear this song, I think DDR.
1088080	1089080	Okay.
1089080	1093320	And I think about anti-abortionists because it's called dance dance revolution.
1093320	1094400	That's not dance music.
1094400	1097200	You can't do anything other than slow dance to it.
1097200	1100800	Are you gonna see someone break out into like some sort of, you know, break dance routine
1100800	1101800	to that shit?
1101800	1102800	No, you can't.
1102800	1106680	You can't dance to it cause it's too fucking slow.
1106680	1107680	Low key.
1107680	1110360	Hold me tight and we'll dance to battlefield.
1110360	1113000	It's the four player mode.
1113000	1114000	Hold each other's hands.
1114000	1115880	Oh, Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1115880	1118800	Did that have like, was it the quality?
1118800	1120360	Why does love feel like a battlefield?
1120360	1121360	Now?
1121360	1124360	Did they have the new pads with the eight arrows or some garbage?
1124360	1126800	It's the exact same fucking pad that came with the universe.
1126800	1130400	Like clearly the surplus that got sent back to Konami headquarters was just packaged in
1130400	1132760	this game.
1132760	1139680	All right.
1139680	1141000	Break man in our chat room.
1141000	1142320	What the fuck is going on tonight?
1142320	1146880	Loki likes games, sky is angry and dark soccer is quiet.
1146880	1148640	I like games all the time.
1148640	1156360	Have you heard me talk negative about saints road the third, grand theft auto, uh, motor
1156360	1164920	store apocalypse, um, I'm sure there's other games in there that I liked.
1164920	1170880	So I, in our chat room, uh, we have free- And, and, and this goes back a few mixes ago,
1170880	1175920	but what is the fucking abomination that is the new dynamite rave?
1175920	1176920	What the fuck is that?
1176920	1179160	I'm not even going to, I'm not even going to try.
1179160	1180840	Uh, we also have Frisbee.
1180840	1181840	I'm sorry.
1181840	1182840	Was it Frisbee?
1182840	1183840	Yeah.
1183840	1186640	Frisbee in our chat room says, this is like Kelly Clarkson in supernova PlayStation two.
1186640	1189040	Well, I'm so glad you brought that up because guess what?
1189040	1191080	Another one of those awesome songs in the track list is
1191080	1205600	At least that's danceable at least like that one didn't, I mean, lover or a hater, at least
1205600	1214480	you can kind of dance to that.
1214480	1215480	That one.
1215480	1219840	Not so terrible, but come on.
1219840	1227120	It's, it's all right to have like one of those songs in there, but not, I get that the songs
1227120	1228920	like that to cross over to mainstream audience.
1228920	1229920	That's fine.
1229920	1232960	I don't have a problem with that song being in DDR, but like the Jordan sparks and Leona
1232960	1233960	Lewis.
1233960	1240840	And I like Leona Lewis when I'm feeling sad, anyhow, let me talk about a game that was
1240840	1241920	a much better investment.
1241920	1244560	As you know, going on right now, steam is having a sale.
1244560	1247120	Uh, there's tons and tons of stuff that's discounted on steam right now.
1247120	1252320	One of the games I grabbed on sale was bit trip runner was $2 and 50 cents on steam.
1252320	1256640	Um, somehow I stepped into the twilight zone where that's the game I should have paid $40
1256640	1261840	for and DDR was worth about $2 and 50 cents because bit trip runner is cool.
1261840	1265400	And like, I wasn't expecting a whole lot of out of this game cause you know, bit trip
1265400	1269920	beat was neat, but it kind of like the shtick got old pretty fast.
1269920	1273880	So the whole pong thing, um, but I liked bit trip runner a lot.
1273880	1278400	Like it really reminds me of an old school 2,600 game, like what it would look like today
1278400	1283320	with the chip to music, very simple controls, but a lot of that whole kind of repetition
1283320	1289440	about how to learn to beat a level and, and, uh, I even throwbacks to the classic Atari
1289440	1294400	console with the whole, uh, bonus levels looking like pitfall complete with a noisy television.
1294400	1298840	Like if you've ever tried to hook up, uh, on an old TV with the RF switch, you get that
1298840	1300760	noise in there mixed with your game.
1300760	1303840	Like I just loved the way it looked like a bit trip runner was a great deal.
1303840	1308760	For two 50, I played more of that game than I did the $40 DDR game.
1308760	1309760	Just say him.
1309760	1314480	So bit trip runner, I endorsed that game, especially if you could call it a music game
1314480	1318600	cause yeah, it involves chip tunes, but to me that's kind of the niche that makes it
1318600	1319600	that much more awesome.
1319600	1322800	Like to me, it's just like a classic Atari game.
1322800	1328720	What it would look like today, just the chip tune element makes it attractive to those
1328720	1333600	that maybe don't always care for the simplistic games, if that makes sense.
1333600	1336240	So, um, let's see, anything else I played this week?
1336240	1337240	I checked out some demos.
1337240	1340600	I don't always like to review games based on the demos, but I'll quickly say I checked
1340600	1346520	out the 32nd hero super mega Neo climax, uh, game on the Xbox 360.
1346520	1348720	I own the PSP version of that.
1348720	1350480	So I wanted to see what it looked like on 360.
1350480	1354880	I like how the 360 has the completely different art modes that look completely different.
1354880	1358080	They have the cell shaded hand drawn mode, which is pretty cool, but they also have the
1358080	1362740	retro mode, which looks more like the PSP version or an eight bit Nintendo classic.
1362740	1364640	So that, that was pretty cool.
1364640	1370160	Um, let's see, uh, and, um, what was the other demo I played?
1370160	1371760	Oh, Galaga legions DX.
1371760	1373000	I think I'm going to buy that one.
1373000	1374500	That one was really cool.
1374500	1380440	That was kind of like geometry wars with the whole Pac-Man championship edition elements
1380440	1381680	in it with the music and everything.
1381680	1385040	Cause by the same team, if I'm not mistaken, but it played a little more like geometry
1385040	1389260	wars, but it doesn't play like the old Galaga games at all.
1389260	1392140	So I thought that was kind of neat.
1392140	1396440	Going to our chat room at a chat dot orange lounge, radio.com, uh, Izzam in our chat room
1396440	1399640	says bit trip is more rhythm puzzle than anything else.
1399640	1404040	Yeah, I could see that I rhythm puzzle, I think is a good way to describe it.
1404040	1409280	Um, let's see, uh, going into our chat room, uh, black Wolf says, Hey, that's not the Glee
1409280	1410280	version.
1410280	1411300	That sucks.
1411300	1414360	And break man says, I hear Glee versions of songs every time I go to target.
1414360	1415360	Yeah.
1415360	1416360	That's the other awesome music franchise.
1416360	1417360	The Konami is doing right now.
1417360	1418360	Glee karaoke revolution.
1418360	1419360	Awesome.
1419360	1420360	But you know what?
1420360	1424320	I, it sells for them, I guess.
1424320	1426920	I mean, I don't know.
1426920	1428480	Yeah, I don't know either.
1428480	1429480	All right.
1429480	1436760	So I bet you all are dying to know more about, um, the game that I'm giving away here on
1436760	1437760	the program.
1437760	1442320	Uh, at the top of the show, I said, uh, who wants to win my birthday present?
1442320	1446080	And we are going to give that away, but to tell us more about, uh, the birthday present,
1446080	1448740	uh, I'm going to call the person who bought it for me.
1448740	1451960	And this is my significant other salacious pop that we're going to bring on the line.
1451960	1452960	Yes, that's right.
1452960	1455760	I'm giving away the present that my significant other bought for me.
1455760	1457320	And we're gonna talk about why.
1457320	1463240	Um, he actually ordered a copy of a child of Eden for me online.
1463240	1467720	And I want to talk about why we are giving away once it arrived, while we're giving it
1467720	1468720	away.
1468720	1469720	Hi.
1469720	1470720	Yeah.
1470720	1471720	Hey, how you doing?
1471720	1472720	I'm doing all right.
1472720	1473720	All right.
1473720	1476560	So we're giving away a game on tonight's show and it's a present you bought me for my birthday.
1476560	1479080	Now you went to buy me a copy of child of Eden, right?
1479080	1480080	Yes.
1480080	1481080	All right.
1481080	1485360	So tell the listeners about how we get from your buying me child of Eden on my birthday
1485360	1488640	to me giving away my present here on the show.
1488640	1494240	Well, I decided that that was definitely what you needed to get for your birthday.
1494240	1499500	So I went on a hunt online to try and find it at a good price because I wasn't really
1499500	1504800	prepared to, um, you know, drop the 60 bones or whatever it costs at target.
1504800	1510520	So I checked out Amazon and a bunch of other sites and I just wasn't happy with, you know,
1510520	1513320	how, uh, what they were offering it for.
1513320	1516120	So I ended up, uh, through Google shopping.
1516120	1521000	I ended up on eBay and I'm sure already some people in studio might know where this story
1521000	1522000	is going.
1522000	1526640	Um, I found a lot of retailers with tens of thousands of feedback, positive score that
1526640	1530920	I could have got it from, but I found this one sort of dog and pony show seller with
1530920	1536380	a feedback score of five or six, um, selling child of Eden and a bunch of other games like
1536380	1541480	halo reach and you know, Madden 11 and a bunch of other stuff new, um, shrink wrapped in
1541480	1544120	America for what I thought was a good price.
1544120	1546720	And at least it was a feedback of one or higher.
1546720	1548680	It wasn't some new eBay account, right?
1548680	1552600	It was like, yeah, it was five, um, which is still pretty low for the fact that they
1552600	1554640	have like 80 auctions running at once.
1554640	1559320	So I was like, all right, I am going to give this a shot and I sell a ton of stuff on eBay
1559320	1561200	and I take it very seriously.
1561200	1566820	So I think I kind of projected the fact that I'm a legit EJ seller onto this stranger person.
1566820	1574000	So um, I buy it and three days later when I get my tracking number, I see that for one
1574000	1576000	I noticed that they closed their account.
1576000	1580160	So they've unregistered from eBay and their feedback score is now zero.
1580160	1586800	Um, and I look at the tracking number and it is from China and anyone who ever orders
1586800	1591240	anything on eBay knows that if your item comes from China, it is a counterfeit.
1591240	1596640	It's a bootleg because the piracy market over in China and Taiwan is millions and millions
1596640	1598640	of dollars of counterfeit titles.
1598640	1602960	So I was like, well shit, it's going to take this game three weeks to get to me and it's
1602960	1605120	obviously fake.
1605120	1610520	So uh, it arrived on Thursday, I open it and here's the punchline.
1610520	1612900	Yes, it is a counterfeit.
1612900	1618920	Obviously it's, it's, I'm surprised at how good the quality is, but it's not good enough.
1618920	1622800	Like you can tell like, wow, they, they printed this on a very high quality, expensive color
1622800	1623800	laser printer.
1623800	1627640	Yeah, it definitely looks like a color copy like, but, but it's very, it's, it's very
1627640	1628640	high quality.
1628640	1632040	But if you look closely, you can just, you can just kind of see that ink, inkjet, little
1632040	1633440	dotting, you know, you know what I mean?
1633440	1637320	If you ever look at an original and an inkjet side by side, you can tell the difference.
1637320	1638320	Yeah.
1638320	1642360	So, um, it obviously it's a counterfeit and if you look at the underside of the disc,
1642360	1646520	you can see that it's, you know, like a DVD are that they, you know, just bought a huge
1646520	1647980	spindle of them.
1647980	1651160	But the game wasn't even a counterfeit child of Eden.
1651160	1653440	It was a counterfeit pal edition.
1653440	1658560	So they bootlegged the European version of Assassin's Creed brotherhood.
1658560	1666080	So it's a bootleg game from China that the pal version whammy number two, that's the
1666080	1668200	wrong counterfeit game from what I ordered.
1668200	1669200	Whammy number three.
1669200	1673360	So that is some yackety sacks, Benny Hill theme shit right there.
1673360	1677280	So we want to give, and before we had the call tonight, I asked you to pick a number
1677280	1682680	from one to, um, of all the people in chat who said that they wanted my 360 games.
1682680	1691800	So we want to congratulate Kaijuto won a copy bootleg copy of Assassin's Creed brotherhood
1691800	1702560	pal edition on the Xbox 360 signed by dark soccer is, but my birthday present because
1702560	1706080	I care about the listeners, I am giving away my birthday present.
1706080	1711320	So yeah, I opened a case for it on eBay and I'm confident that I'm going to get my money
1711320	1712320	back.
1712320	1717720	Um, the price that I got it for was sort of in that nebulous too good to be true, but
1717720	1720800	I could see someone selling the game for cheap at this amount.
1720800	1724520	So even if I get screwed over, which I doubt I will, it's not a horrible heartbreaking
1724520	1727920	amount of money, but not come on eBay.
1727920	1729900	It's not completely unreasonable for someone to sell stuff for cheap.
1729900	1735760	For example, I take games sometimes that I get for free and I just don't want them and
1735760	1736960	I don't really care what I get for them.
1736960	1740240	So I started the auction at one penny and whatever they end at, that's what they sell
1740240	1741240	for.
1741240	1744760	So a lot of times, you know, I think a brink was one that went recently.
1744760	1749400	It went for $24 so it's not unreasonable for that to happen.
1749400	1752560	Of course, my self, my feedback rating is not five.
1752560	1754080	It is much higher than that.
1754080	1758400	But you know, yeah, mine's like 86 and you can actually click on the history and see
1758400	1759400	what they are.
1759400	1764320	But yeah, when I had it, when I had a bunch of, um, uh, adult DVDs from that job, I had
1764320	1768480	like dozens of them that were shrink wrapped that cost, you know, 60 bucks down at the
1768480	1769480	bookstore.
1769480	1773000	I sold them on the adult section of eBay for a penny and some of them only went for 10
1773000	1775960	bucks and they were perfectly brand new retail good items.
1775960	1778480	So I absolutely understand how that could happen.
1778480	1782160	So you thought maybe you'd find somebody like you who was just giving away their excess
1782160	1788040	promo copies of child of Eden, but unfortunately you got a pal copy that's not even real of
1788040	1790360	Assassin's Creed of the game that I didn't order.
1790360	1791360	Yeah, exactly.
1791360	1794240	So tiger claw in our chat room says, what's the moral of the story?
1794240	1796360	Don't order from Amazon.
1796360	1797840	Actually I think you got the moral mixed up.
1797840	1800780	It's it's it's don't order from eBay.
1800780	1806620	Order from a quote legit store like Amazon or Best Buy or fries or whatever the hell
1806620	1807620	you want.
1807620	1813320	Usually, even though, even though PayPal is evil, usually when it comes to shit like this,
1813320	1815320	they usually side with the buyer.
1815320	1821120	So yeah, and there are lots of legit reseller or sellers on eBay that have their own website,
1821120	1824320	but they all just have an eBay account and you'll know that they're legit because their
1824320	1828080	feedback score is in the tens of thousands and those are the ones that you should stick
1828080	1829080	to.
1829080	1832700	So a break man in our chat room says, wait, WTF, if I would ever try to give away a gift
1832700	1834720	from my girl, she would fucking kill me.
1834720	1837720	So are you going to fucking kill me?
1837720	1842380	Well we've we found an even better solution to get you your child of Eden fix and I get
1842380	1843380	to play it too.
1843380	1845460	So no, I'm not, I'm not too heartbroken over this.
1845460	1847640	And we can go ahead and share what we ended up doing instead.
1847640	1849840	It's actually kind of in an ironic way.
1849840	1850840	It's actually kind of funny.
1850840	1851840	This worked out this way.
1851840	1852840	Yeah.
1852840	1856480	I'm a listener of O.L.R.
1856480	1862520	I'm what I'm trying to think of his name is a screen name.
1862520	1869680	Mieglotov called us today told us that on best buy.com or the brick and mortar store
1869680	1875620	if you have one nearby for today and tomorrow, connect games are two for one.
1875620	1881200	So we picked up child of Eden and a fitness game that looked like a fitness game that
1881200	1883040	wasn't actually horrible.
1883040	1884040	We got both of those.
1884040	1886560	So that's, that's your birthday present or those two games.
1886560	1889880	So I ended up getting a two for one deal on which fitness game, I think the year fitness.
1889880	1890880	Oh, that's not bad.
1890880	1891880	Yeah.
1891880	1892880	I mean, I trust me.
1892880	1893880	We looked.
1893880	1895600	We're like, okay, Zumba fitness is the one that's selling really well in Europe.
1895600	1896600	Went to Metacritic.
1896600	1901440	It's 40 something unless you like Latin dancing and I'm talking about Latin female dancing.
1901440	1903320	I do like Latin female dancing.
1903320	1905040	Yeah, it was.
1905040	1906040	Yeah.
1906040	1910120	Your shape fitness evolved, which I think is like a 74 on Metacritic fitness game.
1910120	1911120	That's pretty good.
1911120	1912120	That was pretty good.
1912120	1914320	They have the sequel coming out this year, but we purposely, we just kind of went to
1914320	1916460	Metacritic and pick, pick the one with the best score.
1916460	1917880	So, and that's the one we went with.
1917880	1920780	So we're like, well, let's get a fitness game because I've actually kind of been into fitness
1920780	1923240	and all that stuff lately, like trying to walk more, eat better.
1923240	1925980	I've lost seven pounds in the past two months, so I kind of want to keep that trend going
1925980	1928600	without having to join a gym, join a gym.
1928600	1929960	So be cool.
1929960	1936360	Uh, also, uh, break man in chat says, so basically someone wins Sky's coffee table drink coaster.
1936360	1938520	Hey, I never said it was a good game.
1938520	1941960	Why do you think I was given it away?
1941960	1946080	But Kaijuto says I will put that game up on a plaque, so I'm glad someone, uh, won it
1946080	1947520	who will appreciate it.
1947520	1948520	So congratulations.
1948520	1954040	Once again, you win my birthday bootleg pal copy of the wrong fucking game, Assassin's
1954040	1960320	Creed brotherhood signed by myself, Loki and Dark Sakura's butt.
1960320	1964640	And uh, I think doesn't Loki probably has a system somewhere that would play it.
1964640	1965760	That was actually my first reaction.
1965760	1969400	I'm like, one of Loki's like 10, three sixties could probably play this game.
1969400	1971280	I don't have 10, three sixties.
1971280	1978560	No, my, my J tag, which, which by the way, I broke this week, but I will be fixing it.
1978560	1981600	Um, yes, that would probably be able to play that.
1981600	1984200	But Loki, I've decided I'm going to give it to a listener instead.
1984200	1987480	In fact, uh, Dan's J tag out there probably could play it.
1987480	1988480	All right.
1988480	1989480	Well, Oh, well.
1989480	1990480	All right.
1990480	1993400	Uh, slashes pop while we have you on anything else you want to share with the listeners?
1993400	1998280	Um, just that really insane steam sale that's running, I think all week people need to get
1998280	1999280	on that.
1999280	2000280	Some great stuff on there.
2000280	2001280	Yes.
2001280	2002280	Indeed.
2002280	2003280	Yeah.
2003280	2004280	And win tickets and join the OLR group while you're on there.
2004280	2005280	Hurray.
2005280	2006280	Yeah.
2006280	2007280	Yep.
2007280	2008280	More information.
2008280	2009280	Orange owns radio.com.
2009280	2010280	Okay.
2010280	2011280	Take care.
2011280	2012280	Uh, thank you.
2012280	2013280	Salacious pop.
2013280	2014280	Bye.
2014280	2015280	Bye.
2015280	2016280	And it really is one of those situations where it's the thought that counts.
2016280	2017280	Like I just laughed it off.
2017280	2018880	Like I kind of knew he was getting me child of Eden because when I tried to buy it in
2018880	2022840	the store, he's like, don't you want to wait till after your birthday to buy any big purchases
2022840	2023840	like that?
2023840	2025600	You know, that, that whole little thing.
2025600	2030820	So I kind of knew that was coming, but you know, it, the story behind it is even better
2030820	2032920	than just the game showing up on the doorstep.
2032920	2038120	You know, and you, you even said ahead of time that you felt or that Alan felt something
2038120	2039120	like that might happen.
2039120	2040120	Yeah, no.
2040120	2042680	Well, he knew right away when he bought the game off eBay, but we were all just kind of
2042680	2043680	waiting to see.
2043680	2046600	So we thought we turned it into something fun, like a giveaway.
2046600	2049360	So I'll get in touch with you guys, you know, a little later and we'll get your address.
2049360	2053160	Um, probably ship it out after next week's show because I didn't bring it to the show
2053160	2054160	tonight.
2054160	2055160	So we got to get everyone to actually sign it.
2055160	2056160	All right.
2056160	2059120	Anyhow, um, let's move on quickly housekeeping.
2059120	2064200	Uh, if you want to, uh, sign up for our Facebook, you should facebook.com slash orange launch
2064200	2065200	radio.
2065200	2069280	Also we're on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. And as I mentioned before, uh, if you
2069280	2073280	go to orange lounge radio.com and you are getting in on these steam sales or what have
2073280	2078000	you, the more of you that are getting into steam for team fortress two or portal to your
2078000	2082400	copies on PS three that work on steam, what have you, uh, we actually do have our home,
2082400	2086760	our own little steam community, and you can see that on our website, orange launch radio.com
2086760	2093280	on the left hand side is a little button for steam, uh, in the extended play section, steam
2093280	2098120	community.com slash groups slash O L R. So there you go.
2098120	2099120	All right.
2099120	2101040	Um, let's get into tonight's news.
2101040	2103040	There actually is a lot of gaming news too this week.
2103040	2104520	Uh, so let's get right into it.
2104520	2105520	Loki, start us off.
2105520	2106520	What's going on in the news.
2106520	2107520	Uh, yes.
2107520	2112360	Um, we talked a little bit about this on our teas with, um, Bobby, but a resident evil
2112360	2118560	mercenary 3d just came out last week and there was a big controversy over the fact that Capcom
2118560	2119600	decided, Hey, guess what?
2119600	2124900	You know that save game that, uh, data that you have on there, it cannot be reset.
2124900	2130760	So for example, say you get really far in the game and you decide to sell it and then
2130760	2135320	the next person that buys it, uh, they're stuck with your save game and having everything
2135320	2137640	being unlocked.
2137640	2143320	Um, it was funny because actually at one point GameStop and a lot of the major retailers
2143320	2146560	out there were not going to be taking the game in as a trade.
2146560	2151600	I guess, um, they've reversed their policy on that, but, um, you know, they're saying
2151600	2156520	if upon further review the process with our publishing, our publisher partner, Capcom,
2156520	2163160	uh, GameStop will resume taking trades on the game effective Wednesday, June 29th makes
2163160	2172080	me wonder a couple things here, one, um, so GameStop probably bitched the Capcom to it's
2172080	2173720	all okay all of a sudden.
2173720	2178120	So it makes you wonder if they either they're just fine with the fact that you can't reset
2178120	2183000	your save or there's maybe like a key combination or something like that where GameStop can
2183000	2188720	reset your save, which if that were the case, it'd probably go interesting.
2188720	2191840	I didn't know if, if that's the case that will leak out in seconds.
2191840	2196880	That'll be on GameFacts.com within five seconds of that code being given to a GameStop employee.
2196880	2201280	Um, overseas though it says a retailer HMV has ceased taking trades in for the title.
2201280	2207200	EB Games Australia has also stopped stocking the game altogether and, um, you know, they're
2207200	2211480	just saying if, you know, EB Games, I guess, if you would like to purchase it with us and
2211480	2215800	of course we will sell it to you, it will be a case of an order within our, or with
2215800	2216800	our store.
2216800	2222360	And it says we made, we made the tough decision to remove it from sale because we had everybody's
2222360	2226880	best interest in mind and don't feel that it's fair that you guys would be paying, this
2226880	2233440	is $60 Australian, for what is essentially one, a one use game.
2233440	2237800	So I mean, let's, let's get back to the root problem here because amongst the whole ninth
2237800	2241480	anniversary show and the fact that this news kind of came out on a Sunday last week, we
2241480	2243400	kind of overlooked this story.
2243400	2248920	Um, in what fucking universe was this a good game design idea to not reset the save file?
2248920	2256440	Like I, I, I get the defense is the whole, well it's like an arcade game and I, I, I'm
2256440	2257880	just saying that is the defense.
2257880	2261560	I'm not saying I understand it, but that is the whole like, well it's, it's like an arcade
2261560	2263420	game and it's not detrimental.
2263420	2264560	So what?
2264560	2269920	Like I hate it when game companies try to tell me what I want as a gamer because that's
2269920	2271080	what the gamers want.
2271080	2273760	No, I'm telling you that's not what I want.
2273760	2276600	I do sometimes like to reset my games and start from scratch.
2276600	2279360	I did it on Final Fantasy 13 a few weeks ago.
2279360	2280560	It's like an arcade game.
2280560	2281560	Okay.
2281560	2282560	That's your defense sin.
2282560	2284960	Arcade cabinets, I can reset the goddamn high score.
2284960	2288880	In fact, Capcom arcade games, I can reset the high score on.
2288880	2293000	So where's your logic there?
2293000	2294000	It doesn't make sense.
2294000	2300440	I mean, clearly somebody made this decision and I think this decision absolutely was made
2300440	2305240	to impact the used market because somebody made a conscious decision not to let the game
2305240	2312480	save to the 3DS card internal memory like all the other freaking 3DS games do where
2312480	2316300	if you wanted to reset your data, oh, it's as easy as deleting the file.
2316300	2318200	How easy is that?
2318200	2320400	Somebody made the conscious decision, no, we don't want to do that.
2320400	2327840	We're specifically moving it to the cart and not making it deleteable.
2327840	2331560	But now they've come up with all this crap to kind of back talk their way into how that
2331560	2335560	was a great decision and it's where the game industry is going.
2335560	2336560	It's really what you wanted.
2336560	2338260	Yeah, it's what we wanted.
2338260	2340800	You wanted an arcade experience, didn't you?
2340800	2346120	No, I didn't really want to play the mercenary missions from 4 and 5 ported to the 3DS.
2346120	2348920	I would like, you know, I don't know, maybe a new Resident Evil game.
2348920	2349920	Oh, but guess what?
2349920	2354800	You can play the demo for the new Resident Evil game on this game itself.
2354800	2358980	So I guess there's something to it.
2358980	2363760	But once again, you know, I mean to be fair, it didn't get very good reviews because apparently
2363760	2365660	the game wasn't that great.
2365660	2369040	And so, you know, I don't really consider it a big loss.
2369040	2373360	It's interesting though because this new story yet has people talking about it.
2373360	2377600	And despite the fact it was a mediocre game that probably, you know, the Resident Evil
2377600	2380840	fans would have been, yay, but most other people would have been like, bring on the
2380840	2382360	other 3DS games.
2382360	2388800	It's another, you know, another entry in the long line of bad DRM decisions from Capcom.
2388800	2393680	You know, if it's not, oh, this game needs to be online at all times, you know, in order
2393680	2398480	for it to work even in single player, or like in games that don't even have a multiplayer
2398480	2402180	component, oh, you know, and then the PlayStation Network goes down and their game stops working
2402180	2404080	for, you know, a month or whatever.
2404080	2407600	Alright, so I'm being corrected by the chat room, as tends to happen sometimes on this
2407600	2408600	show.
2408600	2412640	And the chat says, actually Rob, none of the 3DS games I have saved to the SD card.
2412640	2416200	They all save to the 3DS cart, but you can do data management.
2416200	2420160	The only things that save to the SD cart are the street pass and maybe data that won't
2420160	2421220	fit on the cart.
2421220	2422220	So fine.
2422220	2426600	I just haven't noticed because there hasn't really been that big RPG 3DS game that I've
2426600	2429300	wanted to reset the data on so far.
2429300	2434860	I mean, when all is said and done, would I probably really want to reset the data on
2434860	2436360	a game like this?
2436360	2437360	Probably not.
2437360	2438360	Me personally.
2438360	2439360	Probably not.
2439360	2442740	I probably wouldn't have noticed this if it hadn't been called out.
2442740	2446920	But what ticks me off about it is this whole, we all see what you're doing, quit trying
2446920	2449400	to make excuses to say otherwise.
2449400	2452800	Like it's very obvious why they're doing this.
2452800	2453800	Stop lying.
2453800	2455720	It's because they don't want to piss off the fans.
2455720	2461040	They want to piss off the fans because they're trying to do this to save some money.
2461040	2464400	Then they are assuming that their fans are stupid and you should be offended.
2464400	2466320	And really how much money are they saving?
2466320	2471120	Because this game itself is probably going to sell, what, maybe 400,000 units?
2471120	2476480	And that right there is a really generous estimate.
2476480	2480480	I mean, 400,000 units in the lifetime of this game.
2480480	2487280	I mean, we're talking like maybe a few 10,000 copies or whatever that they're going to lose
2487280	2490940	out sales on because someone's going to buy it used.
2490940	2499200	And of saying like 25% of those copies are going to sell for used or something like that.
2499200	2502680	How many people are you really turning away from putting this feature on there?
2502680	2505960	I mean, what, maybe let's just say 10,000 of those people.
2505960	2511360	That's such a minor, minor, minor number compared to people are just not going to give a shit
2511360	2512800	or they just won't buy your game.
2512800	2516440	I mean, I don't know.
2516440	2517440	It's stupid.
2517440	2522000	Black Wolf in our chat room says, hey, this is an investment opportunity, buy five copies
2522000	2526440	this week, save them for three years and sell them as unopened on eBay for a hundred dollars
2526440	2527440	each profit.
2527440	2528440	I don't know.
2528440	2531880	I don't know if that will work if the game is only kind of mediocre.
2531880	2535640	However, I say at the end of the day, vote with your wallet.
2535640	2537320	That's really what it boils down to.
2537320	2541340	Now, to be honest, I probably wouldn't have bought this game anyway, but I especially
2541340	2544560	wouldn't have bought, like if I was on the fence, I would have said, no, I don't really
2544560	2545560	want to support this.
2545560	2549480	Well, that's what was going through my head the whole time is why the crap would I buy
2549480	2550480	that game?
2550480	2552880	There hasn't been a good resident evil game since three.
2552880	2554400	Oh, come on.
2554400	2555400	Four.
2555400	2556400	I like it.
2556400	2557400	Oh, Oh my God.
2557400	2559600	That's one of the best GameCube games, period.
2559600	2561920	Like I realize everybody has their own opinion.
2561920	2562920	That's fine.
2562920	2564640	But I, I, I cannot agree with you.
2564640	2567440	My favorite to this day is still two.
2567440	2571480	I four was like one of the best and I really liked Code Veronica.
2571480	2572480	Period.
2572480	2573480	Wow.
2573480	2574480	All right.
2574480	2578080	I can't agree that five was not what it could have five was not anyhow.
2578080	2579080	Uh, yeah.
2579080	2580640	Vote with your wallet kids.
2580640	2582040	That's really what it boils down to.
2582040	2583040	All right.
2583040	2589540	Now, speaking of, uh, fun money related decisions and what you support and what you don't, where
2589540	2591400	the industry is going.
2591400	2594920	Last week on the show, we talked about the impending Supreme court decision and I got
2594920	2598880	to admit we were a little bit in the, you know, negative defeatist drone last week where
2598880	2602680	we were pretty sure that it was going to come out and that the Supreme court was going to
2602680	2608200	uphold the California law and this vague ass law about what is deemed offensive or whatever
2608200	2613280	would end up with a GameStop employees getting thousand dollar fines and all this crap.
2613280	2617700	Well, the good news is the Supreme court actually ruled the other way.
2617700	2620040	They ruled in favor of the video game industry.
2620040	2625520	They overturned the law, so to speak, which really was never essentially effective.
2625520	2631520	Uh, so in Brown versus entertainment merchants association, which used to be Schwarzenegger
2631520	2634760	versus entertainment merchants association, but you know, we've had a new governor since
2634760	2636560	the law first went into effect.
2636560	2640060	Um, it was reversed in seven to decision.
2640060	2645360	So, uh, they are essentially saying that, yeah, it is a violation of the first amendment
2645360	2646360	and so forth.
2646360	2649800	But there were a couple of justices that seemed to be on the fence with this whole thing.
2649800	2651560	I'm not going to go super, super in depth.
2651560	2653840	I think a lot of you already kind of read about this.
2653840	2657160	It was such a huge thing, but there were a couple of justices that were on the fence
2657160	2662320	with this that were saying like, we understand why there might be a law, just this wasn't
2662320	2663520	really the way to do it.
2663520	2667240	The way you're defining offensive here is a little vague, you know, things like that.
2667240	2672360	So you know, is this all going to be said and done and over with?
2672360	2673880	I guarantee you it's not.
2673880	2678600	In fact, there was some reaction this week from Leland Yee, who was the state Senator
2678600	2681760	who originally drafted this whole bill in the first place.
2681760	2688080	Uh, he's a Democrat, a Democrat representing San Francisco and, uh, he put together a whole
2688080	2693080	little statement that said that the ruling of the Supreme Court, quote, puts the interests
2693080	2696320	of corporate America before the interests of children.
2696320	2699600	As a result of their decision, Walmart and the video game industry will continue to make
2699600	2703720	billions of dollars at the expense of our kids' mental health and the safety of our
2703720	2704720	community.
2704720	2705720	Good God.
2705720	2711560	But if you read the terms, he clearly didn't read the syllabus because, and I read the
2711560	2718120	whole thing, it goes in there to say that the, uh, research that they used was inherently
2718120	2724320	flawed and that actually the same researchers who were trying to make the claim that violent
2724320	2732880	video games were harmful to children said also television, movies, books, Saturday morning
2732880	2736240	cartoons were all equally harmful.
2736240	2742440	Well, on top of all that, he's saying it's in the interest of children, well, children
2742440	2747960	aren't able to purchase, I mean, as it is with the company policies, they're unable
2747960	2754880	to purchase these games in these stores and last time I checked, you know, children don't
2754880	2760680	have $60 of, you know, they don't have a job, so someone's giving them money.
2760680	2765320	Someone's obviously purchasing, someone's driving them to the stores to purchase these
2765320	2770480	games, um, you know, and that person to be a parent and yeah, you know, bikes and stuff
2770480	2771480	like that.
2771480	2777020	But I mean, come on, it's just take some damn responsibility, let, let the responsibility
2777020	2778440	lie with the parents.
2778440	2782580	Well, these also, these same parents keep in mind are encouraging their kids to go play
2782580	2787780	high school football and participate in sports where far more injuries occur as opposed to
2787780	2794440	those related to video games and deaths, oh, don't forget deaths.
2794440	2800000	So uh, by the way, Leland Yi at the end of the day basically said, uh, he's going to
2800000	2802200	try again because there were a couple of people on the fence.
2802200	2805000	No, of course you haven't wasted enough taxpayer money yet.
2805000	2810080	I would like this, okay, so you guys lost the case, Leland Yi, um, so you're gonna pony
2810080	2812720	up that $2 million that we wasted on this?
2812720	2814280	You know what else is very interesting about this?
2814280	2818520	You know, you hear a lot about partisan politics in this nation and this whole like, you know,
2818520	2821440	Republican, Democrat stuff going on here.
2821440	2826040	This really is one of those things that doesn't seem to fall on one party or the other.
2826040	2830760	I mean, yes, a Democrat wrote it, but then when you look at who in the Supreme Court
2830760	2836180	decided to dissent against the majority and actually side with Leland Yi, one of those
2836180	2841280	justices was Clarence Thomas, who was a Herbert Walker Bush nominee to the court.
2841280	2844480	The other one being Breyer, a Clinton, appointee to the court.
2844480	2848280	So this, this isn't partisan either, which is interesting.
2848280	2852000	I think there's so many issues in America where it's like, you know, it's a Republican
2852000	2855560	issue or it's a Democrat issue, but this is one of those things that's really all over
2855560	2856560	the map.
2856560	2857560	Partisan politics is bullshit anyway.
2857560	2862320	It's trying to add regulation for something that there's already regulation for.
2862320	2868000	I suggest that they go in there and we need to enact some sort of force that'll go out
2868000	2870320	there and stop people from committing laws.
2870320	2875260	You know, um, it'll, it'll work above the police department because, you know, we've
2875260	2880440	got the police department there, but I think we need a special military police department
2880440	2881440	or something.
2881440	2884600	I mean, that's almost kind of what this is like to the extreme, obviously.
2884600	2889640	The other thing in the wording of the decision was that they were picking a scapegoat to
2889640	2894680	treat a serious social problem that was not at the heart of the problem, that they're
2894680	2900120	only picking one thing that may actually more be a symptom of the social issue.
2900120	2904120	And that they, you know, they understand parents have a right to want a little bit more assistance
2904120	2911760	from the government and which I think is bullshit, but, um, the whole point is that it's basically
2911760	2915240	the government shall not step in on your personal liberties.
2915240	2918000	We've already had enough of that going on.
2918000	2919760	This is where we draw the line.
2919760	2925100	And I don't understand the whole needing for education for the ESRB ratings.
2925100	2928120	Does anybody need education for the movie MPAA ratings?
2928120	2931960	I've never seen somebody go, oh, I don't know what an R rated movie has in it.
2931960	2935600	I mean, does that ever confuse anybody?
2935600	2941300	Because I see no point to this excuse anyways that, oh, as a parent, I don't understand
2941300	2946320	English on the back of my box that says violence, nudity, does this game contain violence and
2946320	2947320	nudity?
2947320	2948320	Oh, well, it says right there that it does.
2948320	2949320	I mean, so.
2949320	2953360	But the issue, and I'm not even going to say this flat out as a parental issue.
2953360	2956440	I'm going to say this as an essentially American issue.
2956440	2958160	People are fucking lazy.
2958160	2959800	Nobody wants to think for themselves.
2959800	2963360	They want everything handed to them on a plate that says, here, here's everything spelled
2963360	2964360	out for you.
2964360	2965880	So now it's easy.
2965880	2967760	We're going to take out the hard work part of it.
2967760	2969200	Did you see the part?
2969200	2971840	Did you see the whole thing being discussed on the Daily Show?
2971840	2973840	Did you see that whole clip of Jon Stewart talking about it?
2973840	2977600	I watched some of it in the moment that he said he supported Adele of the Room.
2977600	2981340	Well, I didn't think, I didn't get that impression necessarily supported it.
2981340	2982900	It sure seemed like it watching it.
2982900	2987200	But then there was part of me that was like, it was very tongue in cheek, like, is this
2987200	2992060	kind of like tongue in cheek onion style humor that maybe we're just not getting?
2992060	2995680	Because what amazed me about it is as he was talking about the bill and, you know, these
2995680	3000080	horrible games that would be sold, yet he was showing clips uncensored of the games
3000080	3005240	on his program that I could just turn on my television and watch.
3005240	3007120	So granted primetime.
3007120	3011960	I was like, surely this is like just highbrow humor that I'm not getting.
3011960	3014680	No, I think he was actually serious.
3014680	3019460	If you knew nothing about the issue at all and you were just presented this, oh, hey,
3019460	3023800	there was a law that was going to ban these violent games from going, you know, ending
3023800	3028800	up in children's laps, then you could see, oh, well, you know, why did they vote against
3028800	3029800	that?
3029800	3031720	I mean, that doesn't make any sense why they would vote against, you know, these violent
3031720	3033360	games going to kids' laps.
3033360	3037560	Until you explain that, hey, there's already regulation in place, you know, done by these
3037560	3040680	retailers where they're not selling this stuff to people.
3040680	3045040	And there's also not this sort of regulation, you know, done by the law for any other type
3045040	3047140	of media, including TV.
3047140	3052800	So I mean, that's the point that he forgot to point out, because, you know, it's more
3052800	3058740	interesting to have, you know, this violent imagery on screen and him going, you know,
3058740	3060000	because that gets him raided.
3060000	3065520	One point that Dan brought up was that now this might set a precedent for people to basically
3065520	3070640	sue a company for not selling the game, like when they've sent their kid in to go buy it.
3070640	3071800	And the company says no.
3071800	3077040	But it is part of the business that you have the sign that says we reserve a right to refuse
3077040	3078040	service to anyone.
3078040	3079040	That's what I pointed out.
3079040	3080440	No shirts, no shoes, no service.
3080440	3082080	That's what I pointed out.
3082080	3085560	And I'm like, that's not going to be an issue.
3085560	3088480	And he thinks it's going to be otherwise, but I'm like, it's not going to be an issue.
3088480	3090760	A business has the right to refuse service.
3090760	3093400	As long as it's not, you know, discriminatory.
3093400	3099400	And really, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter to me too much because I'm an adult,
3099400	3104160	so it's not going to restrict the thing for me, although it's just, you know, if violent
3104160	3109960	video games have this kind of stigma, then, yeah, a publisher may be more apt to censor
3109960	3112720	the game a bit so that it receives a little rain.
3112720	3117400	But who's to say, you know, that a teen rated game could be deemed, you know, violent enough
3117400	3118400	to fall under this?
3118400	3119400	That's the problem with it.
3119400	3123440	Going to our chat room at chat.org.com, Salacious Pop is actually commenting in our chat room
3123440	3126440	right now and saying, Loki, there's actually two movies where that happened.
3126440	3128280	I think talking about some of the violence.
3128280	3132440	Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which was PG, made parents flip their shit.
3132440	3134680	It's why PG-13 was invented.
3134680	3135680	That's right.
3135680	3138400	I saw faces melting when I was a kid and I turned out okay.
3138400	3139960	Remember that scene?
3139960	3140960	Yeah.
3140960	3143880	And it's so fake now, but when you were a kid, you like close your eyes.
3143880	3145160	No, I'll tell you, you know what?
3145160	3146160	I will tell you what?
3146160	3147160	I saw Gremlins.
3147160	3150840	I'm going to tell you what movie scene scared the fucking shit out of me when I was a kid.
3150840	3153360	And you look back on it now and you're like, that is so dopey.
3153360	3156620	But I'll tell you what, anybody in chat who's in their lower thirties is going to know exactly
3156620	3159200	what their high twenties is going to know exactly what I'm talking about.
3159200	3160200	Okay.
3160200	3161200	Ready?
3161200	3162200	It was in Pee Wee's Big Adventure.
3162200	3163200	Oh my God.
3163200	3164200	Yeah.
3164200	3169680	When he gets in the truck with large Marge and she does this, she's telling the story
3169680	3173600	on a night just like this, right?
3173600	3179680	And then she goes, and it looked like this whole like claymation thing, right?
3179680	3185680	Like little kids bursting into tears across the country, scarred for life will never like,
3185680	3187840	I still can't watch that scene.
3187840	3190360	It's why we are afraid of truckers.
3190360	3191960	Our generation is afraid of truckers.
3191960	3193600	My daddy was a trucker.
3193600	3196480	Then we're afraid of your daddy.
3196480	3197480	Actually my dad is still a trucker.
3197480	3199760	And it's all large Marge's fault.
3199760	3200760	But you know what?
3200760	3201760	That was a PG movie.
3201760	3205400	One of my, no, that scene actually, I still can't watch it.
3205400	3210480	And I actually had a friend had that as their Facebook picture and I messaged them and asked
3210480	3214600	them very nicely if they would remove it because that was a very traumatic scene.
3214600	3217200	Do not find the damn picture, Rob.
3217200	3218200	Oh my God.
3218200	3219200	No, no, no.
3219200	3220200	I'm not finding the picture.
3220200	3221440	I just want to make sure the movie was rated PG.
3221440	3222440	Where was it?
3222440	3223440	I think it was.
3223440	3225000	I just, I, cause I'd be on the art world.
3225000	3226000	Check IMDB.
3226000	3229480	See, look, I can't figure out what this freaking movie is rated.
3229480	3230480	Like should it be this?
3230480	3231480	Rob, IMDB.
3231480	3232480	IMDB.
3232480	3236760	But you know, actually there was one movie that I saw when I was a kid and it was rated
3236760	3239460	our movie and I went to see it with my uncle.
3239460	3243160	I've seen tons of rated our movies when I was a little kid.
3243160	3244220	It's PG.
3244220	3245220	Thank you.
3245220	3246220	IMDB.
3246220	3249380	And this is the only movie rated R that ever scared me.
3249380	3251760	And now today you will laugh at this.
3251760	3252760	What?
3252760	3253760	It was poultry guys three.
3253760	3254760	Oh wow.
3254760	3257440	And then I was afraid of mirrors for like a week.
3257440	3259440	Have you seen it?
3259440	3262240	I was afraid of mirrors for like a week and then I thought that I would die.
3262240	3265520	Like like what's like Heather O'Rourke.
3265520	3268000	And then after a week I was like, Oh yeah, it's stupid.
3268000	3273520	I would love to see as a challenge to filmmakers out there to see what kind of, how fucked
3273520	3278240	up of a movie they could make and have it still be rated G because that would be awesome.
3278240	3281200	Well, look at any Disney movie.
3281200	3285880	I mean, okay, Tarzan, we've all seen that Disney movie, right?
3285880	3286880	Yeah.
3286880	3287880	Spoiler alert.
3287880	3294960	The main villain dies in the movie by being strangled to death by falling down with vines
3294960	3300760	wrapped around his neck with his neck broken and they show the silhouette of it.
3300760	3303620	I was like, this is very violent for kids.
3303620	3305380	Or how about Snow White?
3305380	3309120	Almost all Disney villains die by falling off a cliff and then it's, you just see that
3309120	3310920	little poof of smoke.
3310920	3319260	Or how about Snow White movie from, what was it, 1947 wasn't it?
3319260	3324020	The queen is the old witch trying to push the boulder down the hill and instead lightning
3324020	3325020	strikes her.
3325020	3328360	She falls off the cliff and the boulder lands on her.
3328360	3331680	Okay, right.
3331680	3335120	Lots of people in chat talking about the large Marge scene and how actually there were a
3335120	3337240	lot of people that apparently were scared by that.
3337240	3340360	Dungeon Buster mentions the death of Optimus Prime.
3340360	3341600	Let's see.
3341600	3343160	I hope I'm saying this right.
3343160	3348600	Rade, or maybe that's Raid, Rade says, oh Jesus, large Marge, that scarred me for life.
3348600	3351100	Break Man says, yeah, that was scary because it was so unexpected.
3351100	3354420	And Frisbee says, I still can't watch that.
3354420	3355540	So you're not alone.
3355540	3359000	And of course, SSJ100 Matt provides a YouTube link if you want to see that.
3359000	3362920	Zethur, another one here, the boat scene in Willy Wonka scared me shitless.
3362920	3365520	Dude, that movie was fucked up.
3365520	3366520	It was.
3366520	3368480	Like, I don't like the new one.
3368480	3369840	The old one is far more fucked up.
3369840	3373960	I appreciate them both, but the old one, I was actually a child when I saw the old one
3373960	3375480	and it was kind of fucked up.
3375480	3376480	I was a little afraid.
3376480	3381200	When she's a bad egg and she falls through the chute and all these, I want the world,
3381200	3383040	I want the whole world.
3383040	3386960	There is no way of knowing where exactly we are going.
3386960	3392640	I was afraid of Gene Wilder when I was little for a while, for a while.
3392640	3393640	Our whole generation.
3393640	3394640	I mean, where do you think?
3394640	3396760	Why are we not more screwed up?
3396760	3398920	And yet we all turned out fine.
3398920	3400240	Yeah, we turned out fine.
3400240	3406160	I'm not saying that kids should be subjected to this violence, but I think that's a parent's
3406160	3407160	addiction to make.
3407160	3409840	I saw Star Trek 5 in the theater and I'm not fucked up and that was awful.
3409840	3414160	I think any parent that's saying, I didn't know what this game was rated or I didn't
3414160	3418640	know that this game had violence in it or I didn't know this is just retarded.
3418640	3422240	And if you're like, I didn't know how to read the rating system, you're an idiot.
3422240	3425300	Can you tell us what our old Saturday morning cartoons were like?
3425300	3429600	You know, I realize I don't have kids, so maybe some people are not going to value my
3429600	3433260	opinion, but whatever, F you, it's my show.
3433260	3438640	If I had kids, I would want them to see that violence the first time because they're gonna
3438640	3439640	see it.
3439640	3440840	They're going to see it at a friend's house.
3440840	3442740	They're going to see it at some point.
3442740	3444020	You're going to see it on CNN.
3444020	3446480	They're going to see it when they're flipping through the TV and they'll see it on Comedy
3446480	3447480	Central.
3447480	3448480	Okay.
3448480	3452080	I would rather they see it with me present so we can talk about it.
3452080	3453080	Yeah.
3453080	3456720	It's just like sexual things, although that's a very uncomfortable subject for a lot of
3456720	3457720	parents.
3457720	3461280	I don't want my kids to find out from other places.
3461280	3464840	And I don't understand the double standard between sexual stuff and violent stuff.
3464840	3465840	You have a kid.
3465840	3466840	Tell me I'm right.
3466840	3468280	So it validates my opinion.
3468280	3474660	Well, regardless of the ESRB rating, I'm just going to pick games that I think are suitable
3474660	3476080	for my child.
3476080	3481320	And that may be different than like, honestly, if you teach them well enough, they know what
3481320	3482320	fiction is.
3482320	3487440	I mean, the people that I'm killing in Grand Theft Auto aren't real people.
3487440	3491560	And obviously you don't want to go emulate that on street by going and killing real people,
3491560	3497600	but they're just AI computer controlled people.
3497600	3499640	You can brutally murder them and nothing happens.
3499640	3504360	But my point was going back though to Saturday Morning Cartoons, how many of us grew up with,
3504360	3506160	you know, Pixie and Dixie, Mr. Jinx?
3506160	3507680	Or how about fucking Tom and Jerry?
3507680	3508680	Tom and Jerry.
3508680	3509680	That shit was vulgar.
3509680	3510680	Like, it was very violent.
3510680	3517340	Well, on top of that, keep in mind that these were, and they banned, and they came actually
3517340	3519120	right from vaudeville humor too.
3519120	3524040	But keep in mind, keep in mind, not only did we have, you know, them beating up on each
3524040	3530480	other, but if you look at when a lot of these cartoons were made, when certain racial stereotyping
3530480	3534320	was considered to be standard humor.
3534320	3538660	You know, I grew up watching Tom and Jerry with, you know, Tom and Blackface.
3538660	3542560	We watched Tom and Jerry cartoons in church.
3542560	3544640	I went to a Baptist church when I was younger.
3544640	3546440	Let's, we'll save that discussion for another day.
3546440	3547760	I was raised in one.
3547760	3548760	Yeah.
3548760	3551560	I remember there was a lock in, quote unquote, of the church once and we watched Tom and
3551560	3552840	Jerry cartoons all night.
3552840	3556480	So we watched Song of the South.
3556480	3557480	Oh God.
3557480	3563480	All right, look, I want to move on to other topics, but I, uh, but the point, the point
3563480	3565440	is that parents need to do their job.
3565440	3568600	It's better that you were there with them to explain it than leave them unexposed.
3568600	3573200	You know, I did actually know somebody who was pretty much blocked from everything when
3573200	3576960	she was growing up and now I didn't know her while she was growing up.
3576960	3582240	My friends knew her, but from what I understand, she was a lot more messed up than anyone I
3582240	3584960	known who grew up exposed to everything.
3584960	3587920	Let me quickly get some comments from chat room, chat dot orange on show.com.
3587920	3591560	Break man says, if I ever have kids, I refuse to use cutesy names for things.
3591560	3596660	I want my kids to know that they have a penis or vagina, not a wee wee or a who, um, bonds
3596660	3598000	double six as I agree.
3598000	3601680	My mom had us watch a lot of adult shows and movies and personally I don't think it messed
3601680	3602680	me up.
3602680	3606320	Uh, and then dungeon Buster says, I love the Penn and Teller bullshit show where they looked
3606320	3607960	at violent video games.
3607960	3608960	That was good.
3608960	3611000	Actually, I'll have to find you the clip.
3611000	3616640	They get a 13 year old with his mother's permission, put a gun in his hand and they have a trainer
3616640	3617640	there.
3617640	3618640	You know, it's supervised.
3618640	3619640	There's a police officer there.
3619640	3623160	They give him an automatic weapon and say, okay, go ahead and shoot it once.
3623160	3624400	This is how you do it.
3624400	3626240	Shows him the proper everything.
3626240	3627240	Oh God.
3627240	3631720	The kid shoots the gun, steps back and says, wow, and the guy goes, do you want to do it
3631720	3632720	again?
3632720	3634020	He says, no, I don't want to touch this thing again.
3634020	3638760	And then they showed him later on that he was in tears, 13 years old, but he played,
3638760	3646400	but he goes home and plays so calm and all these violent games yet, you know, is, is
3646400	3651800	this the, you know, reaction that those people who are putting out that propaganda want us,
3651800	3653920	you know, to think is going to happen?
3653920	3657320	I don't know if I would go to that extreme to teach my child, but then again, I have
3657320	3660280	an issue with guns, but we'll save that for another episode of the show.
3660280	3662560	But you get the point that you're saying, no, I do.
3662560	3663560	I do.
3663560	3669400	So the point was, do these games train kids to be killers and clearly not, first of all,
3669400	3673680	he didn't even hit the target or like he hit like way off.
3673680	3677360	And second of all, he didn't even want to touch it again.
3677360	3681360	Now me, I want as many guns as possible, but I would rather have a real gun than play a
3681360	3682360	gun game.
3682360	3683360	Oh God.
3683360	3684360	Here's another one.
3684360	3685360	This was on television.
3685360	3686360	You ready for this one?
3686360	3688160	This is some scary fucking shit from when you were a kid.
3688160	3694120	SGA 100 Matt says, just show your kids Tim Curry as it and they will crap themselves.
3694120	3696720	Actually his name was Pennywise the clown, but yes, same thing.
3696720	3697720	Right?
3697720	3698720	Remember that?
3698720	3699720	That shit was fucking scary.
3699720	3700720	That was.
3700720	3701720	And that was on TV.
3701720	3702720	That was an ABC.
3702720	3704720	Or how many of us watched legend?
3704720	3707360	There's actually a scene in that I can't watch ever.
3707360	3710280	Anyway, we got to get past the kid scary stuff.
3710280	3713120	I want to address from chat real quick.
3713120	3717120	Somebody had asked, what has Leland Yee done besides the bill?
3717120	3720460	So I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, just thumbing through some of the other things
3720460	3721460	he's done.
3721460	3727720	Uh, AB 1371 in 2003 strengthens informed consent requirements for mentally handicapped patients
3727720	3729640	that take part in medical research.
3729640	3737440	Uh, 2004 AB 2412 allows part-time community college faculty to access unemployment benefits.
3737440	3741160	AB 3042 enhances sentences for child prostitution.
3741160	3748600	Uh, let's see, 2006 AB 409 establishes tighter controls and higher health standards for nail
3748600	3749600	salons.
3749600	3755520	Uh, AB 1207 adds sexual orientation to the list of protections in the code of fair political
3755520	3756520	practices.
3756520	3760640	So, you know, he's not been all about, you know, take it or leave it with you.
3760640	3763080	I don't know what there you agree with or what you don't agree with.
3763080	3766320	There's been other stuff to him than just this violent video game law, which I think
3766320	3772000	unfortunately he's making a, uh, a whole career defining thing out of.
3772000	3775080	Just a heads up, he is running for mayor of San Francisco.
3775080	3776080	You may or may not know.
3776080	3780840	Uh, San Francisco, the former mayor Gavin Newsom, uh, is now the Lieutenant Governor
3780840	3783000	of California after the November elections.
3783000	3787440	Uh, so they have an interim mayor and that means there's going to be a new mayor election
3787440	3788440	this year.
3788440	3791920	So there are a handful of candidates in the ring and Leland Yee is one of them.
3791920	3794240	So there you go.
3794240	3798400	Unfortunately, maybe violent video games will be banned in San Francisco.
3798400	3799400	Why not?
3799400	3802200	They're banning Happy Meal toys and circumcision too on top of everything else.
3802200	3803200	So why not?
3803200	3805480	We'll just throw violent video games in there.
3805480	3806480	Anyhow.
3806480	3812160	Oh yeah, I guess I should get one other story here that I meant to mention.
3812160	3816880	Uh, Utah, uh, Utah was going to be doing a similar type of thing.
3816880	3821920	However, the rep, uh, Michael Morley that was trying to get the law passed in Utah said,
3821920	3828040	uh, after the Supreme Court decision, quote, it's not on my radar to fight that fight.
3828040	3832160	So I guess after the Supreme Court decision, he's decided there are better things to do.
3832160	3833700	All right, let's move on.
3833700	3834700	More news.
3834700	3835700	Dark Sakura.
3835700	3840180	I was still trying to find this one article that was talking about the greatest cartoons
3840180	3841640	for traumatizing children.
3841640	3844800	Um, but how about we talk about Zinga?
3844800	3847760	Zinga has something that's pretty traumatic for children.
3847760	3848760	Yes, it is.
3848760	3850120	It has something very new.
3850120	3854840	And I am actually going to quote this article because I like the way it's laid out.
3854840	3855960	It's a new venture.
3855960	3859840	It's something different from Farmville and Frontierville.
3859840	3861440	So here's where the quote begins.
3861440	3864240	One, it doesn't actually have Ville in the title.
3864240	3867760	Two, players play with actual totally real money.
3867760	3870720	Three, players companies won't necessarily grow.
3870720	3873080	In fact, it may shrink through no fault of their own.
3873080	3874080	Wait, wait.
3874080	3876000	Players play with real money?
3876000	3877000	Mm-hmm.
3877000	3880880	The company is Zinga and it's not a game but a stock offering.
3880880	3881880	They're going public.
3881880	3883480	Oh, I get it.
3883480	3885040	They're going public.
3885040	3892560	They are filling an S1 form and it's not going to be publicly traded.
3892560	3893560	So you know what this means?
3893560	3896560	We can really fuck them now.
3896560	3901560	No, I think their stock's actually, they're expecting their stock to jump up in price
3901560	3903400	quite a bit, so it might not be a bad buy.
3903400	3909520	So, I mean, Zinga really, really relies on Facebook for a lot of their business.
3909520	3910520	A lot.
3910520	3912960	Like I know they're going to come out and say they don't need Facebook to survive, but
3912960	3913960	they kind of do.
3913960	3915680	Like Facebook put them on the map.
3915680	3921440	Now with all this talk about the decline of people using Facebook, Google Plus is coming
3921440	3922800	out and has people talking.
3922800	3925360	I mean, you know, don't put it in the nail coffin of Facebook yet.
3925360	3927200	Assuming that they let people in.
3927200	3931320	But I'm just saying, you know, there is this talk about Facebook might be slipping a little
3931320	3932320	bit.
3932320	3935600	Like it's time for Zinga to say, trust in us.
3935600	3941000	Like I really think I personally, I just kind of think Zinga needs to find a niche that
3941000	3944940	isn't just Facebook games or isn't just a VIL game.
3944940	3948120	Like I know you were kind of joking with the whole story about the stock market, but like
3948120	3952640	it would be great for Zinga's profile if they could do a game that's not VIL.
3952640	3955720	Now I'm sure somebody is going to bring up and okay, find the words.
3955720	3956720	Farm villain.
3956720	3957720	No, no.
3957720	3958720	The words with friends.
3958720	3962120	There actually is a Facebook game called Farm Villain and it's about like posting status
3962120	3964080	updates to your wall that are fucked up shit.
3964080	3969240	But anyway, there's the words with friends free and the, uh, hanging with friends on
3969240	3973920	that they got from buying other developers basically, but you know, Zinga doesn't kind
3973920	3979080	of yet have that thing that they're known for besides Facebook games.
3979080	3981320	You know what I mean?
3981320	3987340	So that and a very neutered dog on their logo.
3987340	3989880	Where does that, doesn't that name have like a weird meaning to it too?
3989880	3994640	I can't remember like where the company name came from or something silly.
3994640	3997100	Islander says, I didn't know Zinga was on Facebook.
3997100	3999320	I've just been playing on MySpace.
3999320	4003080	Ladies and gentlemen, we have found the one person that is still on MySpace.
4003080	4004240	I thought it was Tom.
4004240	4007400	I thought it was Justin Timberlake, but go to chat right now.
4007400	4008400	He's there.
4008400	4010400	Zinga is the CEO's dog.
4010400	4012320	Oh, that's why the logo is a dog.
4012320	4013320	That makes sense.
4013320	4014320	All right.
4014320	4015320	Uh, let's see.
4015320	4019200	By the way, we got a tweet about this tonight from a Twitter user, Nathan Jackson.
4019200	4021440	I would like you all to talk about Zinga going public.
4021440	4025280	Do you all think it would be sustainable with games like Farmville going down?
4025280	4028880	Uh, kind of that same point I was just making like things are declining.
4028880	4034920	So I think the only way Zinga can be successful is for them to show what else they have that
4034920	4037040	isn't just Farmville and Facebook games.
4037040	4040120	And I think this whole word with friends and stuff is a good place to start, but they have
4040120	4045880	to be able to show that they can consistently be on top of these social or casual gaming
4045880	4048880	trends if you will.
4048880	4052840	I just hope to God it's not true that they tried to buy PopCap.
4052840	4056260	That would be, that would make me very sad if Zinga and PopCap merged.
4056260	4057260	Very sad.
4057260	4063240	All right, moving on, let's get to some other news stories and release dates soon.
4063240	4065640	Some more depressing news.
4065640	4073020	If you thought, you know, the government trying to fine you for purchasing an adult game if
4073020	4081120	you're under the age was bad, well, Senate Bill S978 is gonna really get you going.
4081120	4087540	It's gonna basically regulate a lot of stuff that's going on the internet, mainly streaming
4087540	4092880	unauthorized copyrighted material, making it a felony that will result in up to five
4092880	4096660	years of jail time if it's passed.
4096660	4100920	Basically it says, the bill states that 10 or more public performances by electronic
4100920	4108200	means during any 180 day period of one or more copyrighted works will result in not
4108200	4110960	more than five years of imprisonment.
4110960	4117760	So as long as the performance in question is valued at least $2500 US, or the value
4117760	4124160	of the license to legally perform its content is valued at $5000 or more.
4124160	4129120	And basically it's the same criteria that they allow right now for the DMCA takedown
4129120	4131720	notices to be issued by copyright holders.
4131720	4137160	However, jail time and felony status are not currently associated obviously with those,
4137160	4144720	and now they're saying right now it says if it manages to pass.
4144720	4148640	The homemade gameplay clips, which I've never heard of them called like this, but apparently
4148640	4157980	referred to as let's play videos, fan made music videos, a webcam, cover songs, anything
4157980	4160560	I guess that involves music or video.
4160560	4167240	It could potentially cover cell phone videos of concerts and press events.
4167240	4175420	So yeah, basically if they're saying that this could apply to YouTube users, and also
4175420	4183360	sites that embed YouTube content as well, and really to get down to the bottom, I think
4183360	4185680	they're gonna have a hard time regulating this stuff.
4185680	4192240	I mean, if they're gonna go after everything, then, I don't know, and this is only gonna
4192240	4193440	benefit what?
4193440	4198400	I understand that you, for example, if you take a song off an album and you put it as
4198400	4204840	a YouTube video and you leave it there so people can listen or pirate that song, I understand
4204840	4205840	that's bad.
4205840	4212320	If for example, and I don't even know about so much the music videos and stuff, I don't
4212320	4216760	have a real big problem with that, especially gameplay videos, I don't understand gameplay
4216760	4225540	at all because it's not really the same as like putting a movie up, like an actual cinematic
4225540	4230320	movie and you're pirating or like a TV show or something like that.
4230320	4235600	This law is absolute total utter bullshit, and the problem with it is that it's just
4235600	4237160	shittily written.
4237160	4239440	Is that a word I can use, shittily?
4239440	4240440	It can be.
4240440	4248840	Anyway, this law was shite, it is total utter shite, and the reason why it's shite, it's
4248840	4251200	just badly written because it includes all this other stuff.
4251200	4253000	I get what they're trying to do.
4253000	4256800	What they're trying to do is they're trying to get at these websites where you can log
4256800	4262940	in and you can stream movies that are in the theater, you can stream them, or current TV
4262940	4264040	shows and all that.
4264040	4268200	That's what they're doing, but because they've left the door so wide fucking open, if somebody
4268200	4272780	gets on there and tapes a karaoke performance and puts it up on YouTube, it could be subject
4272780	4274080	to this law.
4274080	4277400	And you might be saying, well that's not what they're trying to go after, but unfortunately
4277400	4282560	when you have a shittily written law, excuse me, a shite law like this, it leaves the door
4282560	4283560	open for that.
4283560	4287280	I mean, if you're saying that if this isn't what they're going to try to do with it, well
4287280	4292520	yeah, sure, I'm sure that that one person downloading that one MP3 really costs that
4292520	4296880	music company $100,000 for that one song.
4296880	4301640	The problem is this is also, it's just taking a big fat dump all over fair use.
4301640	4306640	Like I should be, yes, I should be able to upload video for the purpose of critiquing
4306640	4308280	and commenting on it.
4308280	4312320	So you mean I'm going to have to contact the copyright owner to get express permission
4312320	4313320	to do that?
4313320	4314320	Well guess what?
4314320	4320080	All of your game review videos are going to be done by IGN, 1UP, GameSpot, and all the
4320080	4324200	big companies because Activision all those times, they don't have the time for little
4324200	4328920	pissants like you and me that they're going to sign off on the rights for that.
4328920	4332520	So say goodbye to independent media if something like this passes.
4332520	4333520	You know what?
4333520	4337200	Say goodbye to Orange Lounge Radio if this passes because I'm telling you, if this bill
4337200	4341480	in its current form passes and goes effective, I'm walking away from the show because I am
4341480	4347640	not going to go to jail because I like to play music over the classic game of the week
4347640	4349720	for the purposes of critiquing it.
4349720	4350720	That is not a threat.
4350720	4351720	That is a promise.
4351720	4355560	If the law passes and is enforced, there will not be Orange Lounge Radio anymore.
4355560	4356560	Period.
4356560	4357560	Well, I don't know.
4357560	4359920	Maybe Loki and Dark Soccer will decide they want to do it, but somehow I don't think they
4359920	4362440	want to subject themselves to that either.
4362440	4367520	Like that is the seriousness of this bullshit law.
4367520	4369320	I get what they're trying to do.
4369320	4370640	They're not doing it right.
4370640	4376760	So they need to, you need to contact your senator, contact folks and tell them that
4376760	4381200	this law is a bad thing for America.
4381200	4386000	Now just to let you know, there actually is a site up there that will generate email to
4386000	4389660	your local legislature.
4389660	4392520	So you do have a way of getting out there.
4392520	4395560	Actually I have relinked it on my live, not my live channel, but my Facebook.
4395560	4398080	And who is voting these goddamn people in the office?
4398080	4401120	I mean, seriously, all these Lin Yee's and shit.
4401120	4404880	Oh, and he's going to become mayor now because he's such full of wonderful ideas.
4404880	4405880	That's great.
4405880	4409680	Remember what I said about lazy Americans?
4409680	4417280	The fact that people won't get up and vote when these things come up, just sit back and
4417280	4418280	bitch about it.
4418280	4419280	Sorry, you don't vote about it.
4419280	4420280	You have no right to complain.
4420280	4424440	Uh, Tiger Claw in our chat room says, yesterday I was on Justin TV and I did a search of Transformers
4424440	4428200	and sure enough people were streaming a bootleg of Transformers 3 in a foreign language.
4428200	4429200	Hahaha.
4429200	4434660	Well then they, that needs to be worked out between Justin TV and the copyright owners
4434660	4436080	of the work.
4436080	4440400	And Justin TV should take action there thusly against those accounts of people doing it
4440400	4443200	because I'm sure that is against their terms of service.
4443200	4445600	Like that's the law you need.
4445600	4450880	Not sending me to jail because I want to sing, uh, or I wouldn't, I want to post a tape of
4450880	4453160	Jessica and I singing Love Shack on the internet.
4453160	4455880	Actually I would never post that tape on the internet, but she did and I don't want her
4455880	4456960	to go to jail for that.
4456960	4463920	And, and, and on top of that, that would make certain games illegal because I believe like
4463920	4470160	SingStar and stuff like that allows you to take songs and record videos to them and post
4470160	4471160	them up on the internet.
4471160	4472160	Correct.
4472160	4476660	And also there's going to be a game like SingFour, um, the hits edition that's going to have
4476660	4478440	connectivity with YouTube as well.
4478440	4483240	So all those are basically felony makers.
4483240	4488400	Unless of course those people that own those songs or, you know, own those video game companies
4488400	4489960	and stuff like that.
4489960	4495400	Don't stop these things from going, cause if no one complains, then you know, it's going
4495400	4496400	to be all right.
4496400	4499320	Black Wolf in our chat room says, well, to be fair, I don't know if the guy who wrote
4499320	4503080	this bill campaigned on this, so they could have voted him in without knowing he was going
4503080	4504840	to pen this specific bill.
4504840	4506280	And that's a, that's a true point.
4506280	4510280	You never know what politicians are going to do, but we need to hold them accountable.
4510280	4514960	And I plan to write my Congress people and say, if you support this bill, I will not
4514960	4516240	vote for you.
4516240	4517640	I will not vote for you.
4517640	4522920	What's it take to like, say for example, um, get these guys out of office, you know, there's
4522920	4525160	these elections that they have every few years.
4525160	4530040	Well, I understand that, but I'm, I, you know, Hey, we can recall, I guess that's what happened
4530040	4535760	with governor or how governor Schwarzenegger got into office in the first place.
4535760	4539600	So I can't remember the govern ater, that's where that all came from.
4539600	4544000	He terminated the other governor and where that shit, you know, I think we ended up with
4544000	4546620	the worst governor, but I don't want to make this show political.
4546620	4549640	So anyhow, I'm too late for that.
4549640	4550640	I know, right?
4550640	4554560	Like I really didn't want, especially after last week where things got a little heated,
4554560	4557840	like I really didn't want to have a political show tonight, but like we can't fucking get
4557840	4558840	away from it.
4558840	4565500	It's all that's in the news this week is all this political stuff.
4565500	4567280	Let's move to another country.
4567280	4568400	Let's make our own country.
4568400	4569400	It's O.L.A.
4569400	4577800	Uh, by the way, the Senator that's behind this is, uh, Amy Klobuchar, Klobuchar, Democrat
4577800	4580480	from Minnesota and Minnesota.
4580480	4584400	There's a whole website, open congress.org that will show you who's in favor of it and
4584400	4585400	who's against it.
4585400	4588720	Right now, 51 companies for it, three against.
4588720	4591320	I'm telling you though, if it goes through, it's going to be yet another one of those
4591320	4595520	laws that gets tied up because I, I would be fucking pissed cause this is just seems
4595520	4596840	to violate fair use.
4596840	4600400	Like really, I can't film somebody at karaoke?
4600400	4601400	Like that is wrong.
4601400	4604200	Well, and how, how more ridiculous is this going to go?
4604200	4608680	I mean, on the bright side, American Idol will finally go off the air.
4608680	4612400	It's like, um, say for example, you know, the happy birthday song.
4612400	4613400	Is that public domain?
4613400	4617800	I mean, is, are people going to get sued because there's a song playing in the background of
4617800	4620440	like a YouTube video or something like that?
4620440	4629640	Quoting videos, well, you know, Leland, you at least one quote, you know, he's talking
4629640	4633480	about different, you know, stuff, you know, pandering towards corporations.
4633480	4637160	I think this is one of those things that panders towards a corporation, not necessarily the
4637160	4638960	one that you're quoting.
4638960	4643080	Um, when he made that comment, but there are definitely a lot of bills and stuff that go
4643080	4646840	towards these corporations that have these senators in their pockets.
4646840	4648320	So I don't know.
4648320	4649960	It's not, not much of a surprise.
4649960	4653680	Just so you guys know, here's some of the organizations that are supporting this bill.
4653680	4657720	The Directors Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild, the Motion Picture Association
4657720	4663840	of America, Recording Industry Association of America, NBCUniversal, Viacom, Sony Pictures
4663840	4671320	Entertainment, Ultimate Fighting Championship, uh, Church Music Publishers Association.
4671320	4672760	Well, we're fucked.
4672760	4674280	Church Music Publishers Association.
4674280	4679000	It's all the RAA and MPAA and all the different movies to use because no one wants piracy.
4679000	4684720	But you know what, that I understand, hey, no, I have no problem with them fighting piracy.
4684720	4691200	I get the, yeah, the, the, the reason this bill is going into place, I get it.
4691200	4692640	This bill doesn't cut it.
4692640	4696880	You need to close these loopholes in the bill before it, and basically what is going to
4696880	4705000	stop every website in Canada and other countries like I, this is another reason, oh, I promised
4705000	4708560	I wouldn't get political, but I can't.
4708560	4712120	This is another reason I can't keep supporting these bills that try to regulate the internet
4712120	4713440	in America.
4713440	4717400	You idiots, America does not rule the world, contrary to what everybody seems to think
4717400	4719040	sometimes here.
4719040	4721040	You can't stop the rest of the world.
4721040	4723480	Hey, well, at least we can still stream in Canada.
4723480	4726000	It will all go to China.
4726000	4728440	Look at the story we started off with tonight.
4728440	4731160	Where did the rampant piracy come from?
4731160	4734800	Where did Ask Cree Bro come from?
4734800	4738120	China.
4738120	4741440	So all the fine Orange Lawn's radio is moving to China.
4741440	4746080	If this bill goes through, at least we can do our show from there.
4746080	4748680	I'd rather live in Taiwan.
4748680	4753000	We can still stream it, you know, stream to Canada and I can play all the Assassin's Creed
4753000	4754000	brotherhood.
4754000	4756160	We don't have to say where we're located.
4756160	4761160	We're in Canadian and not in the U S I'm not Benji in our chat room says actually happy
4761160	4762500	birthday is copyrighted.
4762500	4763500	That's right.
4763500	4767120	So if you put up a YouTube singing happy birthday to someone, you're going to be, your ass is
4767120	4770400	going to jail for, I would love to see that article.
4770400	4774140	Grandma goes is, you know, okay.
4774140	4778080	What happens if you know, you make do three different songs, we'd be singing like happy
4778080	4783560	birthday and then a couple of other karaoke songs and that's three strikes or three, no,
4783560	4784560	that's not three strikes.
4784560	4791000	It's major like a violent felonies I think, but DJ Morpheus in the chat room, our good
4791000	4794720	buddy from under sedation live Saturday nights here at all games, but not to worry.
4794720	4796200	This is going through Congress.
4796200	4798800	So the public will have a voice and courts to fight it.
4798800	4802960	Unlike carp, which was all secretly done behind closed doors.
4802960	4809000	Well, God damn sir, I hope you are right because three words, this bill sucks.
4809000	4810000	Fucking sucks.
4810000	4811000	Four words.
4811000	4812000	All right.
4812000	4817560	And this is really more important than, you know, balancing a budget.
4817560	4821220	Dark Ted Sousa says, well, we're still waiting to see if under station live will be banned
4821220	4822220	in China.
4822220	4825020	It'll, it'll be a great little thing for the network.
4825020	4829000	It'll be like the show from China versus the show that can't be in China.
4829000	4830000	All on one network.
4830000	4833560	He said all games.com will also have to move to China or Canada.
4833560	4838040	Where can all games.com go if this bill passes all games.com?
4838040	4839440	What country would we put them in?
4839440	4840920	Where would Scott Rubin want to be?
4840920	4850320	They can go to, uh, where would Scott Amsterdam, no, no, there's no football there.
4850320	4852960	Oh shit.
4852960	4861280	Football, but not, well then I guess they could do Canadian football in Canada.
4861280	4862280	All right.
4862280	4864160	Moving on.
4864160	4867640	This bill is, uh, it's taking far too much time on our show, but at the same time it
4867640	4868800	is very important.
4868800	4871120	And so, uh, we just want to bring your attention to it.
4871120	4877180	Like I'm not fucking around if this bill passes, say goodbye to a lot of your favorite gaming
4877180	4878180	press stuff.
4878180	4881120	This, this is bad for the gaming industry.
4881120	4883080	This is bad for the gaming industry.
4883080	4885680	And if they don't see it, they're morons.
4885680	4886800	It's impotent.
4886800	4892880	Speaking of morons, Nintendo of America updated their Facebook page on Sunday, promising that
4892880	4896440	they would give more updates soon regarding some of the petitions that have been going
4896440	4897440	around.
4897440	4898440	We talked about this last week on the show.
4898440	4902520	I think dark soccer brought up how fans were petitioning for releases of Xenoblade, the
4902520	4908480	last story in Pandora's tower here in the U S uh, it was called operation rainfall.
4908480	4912920	Well on, uh, let's see Tuesday, I think was the day it was finally posted.
4912920	4914880	They finally posted a response.
4914880	4917400	Fans have been waiting for this quote.
4917400	4922100	We never say never, but we can confirm that there are no plans to bring these three games
4922100	4924960	to the Americas at this time.
4924960	4930200	The Twitter response thanked operation rainfall folks for being such incredible fans, but
4930200	4935000	said there continues to be no plans for Nintendo of America to release these three games right
4935000	4936000	now.
4936000	4940520	So I see, I haven't seen people rally for a Wii games release in a very long time, not
4940520	4946440	since president cat have fans rallied for a Wii game to be released, which by the way,
4946440	4951520	I don't know if you guys saw this, but a destructor had an article this week because of all this
4951520	4955320	about the 10 great Wii games that should have been released that folks are campaigning for
4955320	4958680	that never were president cat made the list.
4958680	4963140	So our little campaign was not forgotten, which I think is great.
4963140	4967400	And they actually said the game is called president cat people, which made me laugh
4967400	4969360	because the game actually wasn't called president cat.
4969360	4973200	We kind of gave it that name because the translation was like boss cat.
4973200	4975960	And so I don't know, it just kind of came out, let's call it president cat.
4975960	4983440	Well, the, the definition of a Sukeban is like a delinquent gang leader girl.
4983440	4988640	So if you imagine a cat being like a delinquent gang leader who was also the president of
4988640	4992120	the company, yes, then that's what it's like.
4992120	4994920	Gang banger cat.
4994920	4996360	That can be the sequel.
4996360	4998560	All right.
4998560	5000840	Um, geez.
5000840	5007600	Anyhow by the way, Xenoblade is still getting a localization for an English speaking country
5007600	5014580	and then some, uh, there is a European localization in the works and uh, this is for Xenoblade
5014580	5018120	Chronicles and it was in an Iwata Asks interview.
5018120	5020120	That's a little video clip there.
5020120	5023080	And uh, Xenoblade is coming out in Europe on September 2nd.
5023080	5027800	It's going to come out with a red classic controller pro in order to, to localize a
5027800	5028800	game for Europe.
5028800	5034280	I think it's gotta be an English, French, Spanish, German, and I'm forgetting a language,
5034280	5040920	but like there's like five languages, Swahili, probably English, French, Spanish, probably
5040920	5041920	Italian.
5041920	5043600	That's like five different languages.
5043600	5048380	The game's got to be in to come out over there and uh, she just do it in Latin yet.
5048380	5051260	It's not worth the money to put out here.
5051260	5056280	It would take no money, I mean, no additional money to bring it over here, seeing as they're
5056280	5057280	already doing the translation.
5057280	5060640	Well at least I could go on eBay and get a bootleg of it from China, at least you'll
5060640	5061640	get that.
5061640	5062640	At least.
5062640	5067360	I'm of course, you know, their comment on Twitter was, you know, that in fact, Operation
5067360	5072320	Rainfall, someone retweeted that and they made the comment of, they basically retweeted
5072320	5077440	what Nintendo said, to which I put dot dot dot, instead we have some more Nintendo 64
5077440	5080720	games we'd like to port over and make zero changes and Zelda you had a premium.
5080720	5082280	Love Nintendo.
5082280	5089840	Exactly, Zelda, Zelda Ocarina of Time in 3D, not a problem, Xenoblade, fuck you.
5089840	5090840	That's what I'm hearing.
5090840	5092800	But hey, you know what though?
5092800	5096600	Nintendo's gonna be, you don't understand, here's how Nintendo's gonna fucking play this
5096600	5097600	shit off.
5097600	5103120	Well we have no plans on doing that right now, but come E3, fans demanded it, and Nintendo,
5103120	5107360	we hear you fans, we're gonna bring it out for you because we're so gracious, we're gonna
5107360	5109000	bring them out to you.
5109000	5113360	It's basically, you're gonna beg for it, and then they're gonna say no, and they're like,
5113360	5115800	ah, well we're so gracious, we're gonna bring it out to you.
5115800	5116800	So you know what?
5116800	5118480	When they do that, don't fucking buy it.
5118480	5119480	Tell them, fuck you.
5119480	5120640	Wait, but why wouldn't you?
5120640	5124720	If they finally do decide to release the game, isn't that what you wanted?
5124720	5128360	Because it's the attitude that they're having with it?
5128360	5131480	I don't know if I meet you all the way, they're like, I don't disagree that something like
5131480	5137320	that is very likely to happen, but I had said before the show, I said, watch, because Nintendo
5137320	5142040	likes to kind of take games and redo them for new consoles, like, these will all be
5142040	5146080	games on the Wii U, and they'll be able to say that, oh, we're listening, oh, these are
5146080	5151360	games that the hardcore gamers want, Last Story Plus Edition on the Wii U, it's Last
5151360	5153400	Story U, and Xenoblade U.
5153400	5160120	No, it's not gonna be that at all, because that would take additional effort.
5160120	5161400	They're not gonna put in additional effort.
5161400	5164760	I don't even understand what the point is, because like, they've had other games that
5164760	5170240	they have translated the English and released only in Europe and Japan, and never brought
5170240	5176400	the Europe version of the game over here, which, I mean, I would think if you're spending
5176400	5179480	the money to translate in the English, why not release it over here?
5179480	5183500	Hell, you don't have to fucking advertise this thing very much, just put it out.
5183500	5188420	You will sell some copies of it, especially something that people are demanding that be
5188420	5189420	brought over here.
5189420	5192640	Of course, their thought is probably, oh, well, this is such a niche game that no one's
5192640	5196840	gonna really buy it, but then at the same time, I think, well, let's see, you put out
5196840	5202160	Mr. Case Files, the Malgrave incident, no one really gives a shit about that.
5202160	5205280	That one just went poof, like, no one even knew that came out.
5205280	5210000	If we had not mentioned that it came out, no one would fucking know that the game came
5210000	5213520	out.
5213520	5217920	It's a bummer that it's the Wii, because if this was the 360 and there wasn't enough fan
5217920	5221840	demand, we've seen now where that game, and I forget what it was, Death Smile or whatever,
5221840	5227280	was that Japanese shooter game that came out in Japan, and they just said, you know what,
5227280	5230880	we'll put it up as a download title, we're not gonna bother to translate it, though,
5230880	5235460	so fucking, here it is, just take it, if you want it, but I think people are generally
5235460	5236460	happy with that.
5236460	5239460	And now there are special box sets and everything.
5239460	5244280	So unfortunately, it would be great if the Wii could support that, but it can't.
5244280	5245280	And on top of that.
5245280	5249680	Maybe the Wii, maybe the punchline is the Wii U will, and these games will be downloadable
5249680	5250680	on the Wii U.
5250680	5252080	And here's the funny part about that.
5252080	5256520	On top of the fact that they won't even bring it over here, they give Europe a nice collector's
5256520	5259400	edition with a controller and everything for them.
5259400	5263560	So obviously they know that the game's popular, but they just still don't give a fuck about
5263560	5264560	you.
5264560	5265880	Rickster in our chatroom says, why do that?
5265880	5268120	Nintendo has already put the Wii out to pasture.
5268120	5271760	And I think that's a good point, is, you know, well, they've already said the Wii U's coming,
5271760	5276200	so let the Wii die, basically a slow death as we get our last little hurrah Zelda game
5276200	5277200	this holiday.
5277200	5281160	The Wii U's and people, and this Wii U isn't coming out until the end of next year, so
5281160	5283280	what the fuck are they going to put out?
5283280	5286840	Is everybody planning on buying a Wii U day one?
5286840	5287840	No!
5287840	5290640	If I've learned one thing from Nintendo consoles, no I'm not.
5290640	5294560	I'm not planning on buying this thing day one, I mean, unless there's that just kick-ass
5294560	5296680	must-have game, we'll wait and see.
5296680	5301560	I am a consumer whore though, so I still may succumb to needing it earlier or something
5301560	5306880	like that, but it really so far hasn't, I mean it's basically a Wii with better graphics
5306880	5311200	and a stupid controller that I don't really give two shits about.
5311200	5312200	But...
5312200	5317480	But I'm just gonna like, well, when the PlayStation 3 came out, the PlayStation 2 didn't just
5317480	5318480	roll over and die.
5318480	5319480	No, it still has it.
5319480	5325400	God of War was still going, and the old systems don't just roll over and die.
5325400	5326400	So I think these games...
5326400	5330200	Especially not the Wii, because you have to understand, just because everyone bought a
5330200	5331840	Wii does not mean they're going to buy a Wii U.
5331840	5336320	In fact, I think because you got all these old people and stuff like that to buy Wii's,
5336320	5337320	no!
5337320	5342320	That is not going to translate into more Wii U sales, just because you can use these Wii
5342320	5343320	games on there.
5343320	5344320	I mean, think about it.
5344320	5348160	It's like, Rob, I need to buy a Blu-ray player, but hey, it's okay, because I can still play
5348160	5349440	my DVDs on it.
5349440	5353080	Well, why am I going to buy a new unit if I already have something that plays DVDs?
5353080	5354440	It doesn't make any sense.
5354440	5355440	I gotta say this.
5355440	5358880	I'm not the only one that doesn't understand your perspective, Loki, of campaign to get
5358880	5362520	the games out, and then when they come out, say fuck them because of their bad attitude.
5362520	5366520	Derek H. in our chat room says, wait, so you'd be upset if they do what you want them to
5366520	5367520	do?
5367520	5370760	That's like going to McDonald's, buying a Happy Meal, then throwing it on the ground
5370760	5374240	yelling, fuck you, Ronald McDonald!
5374240	5378080	The sad thing is, I can see Loki doing that!
5378080	5380000	There isn't enough fucking bacon!
5380000	5386780	No, it's my problem is, how else then do you teach a company like this that you're not
5386780	5388080	going to fucking take their...
5388080	5389080	Oh, well, if you're big...
5389080	5392560	Well, if you're going to just have to take Reggie and bend him over your knee and say
5392560	5393560	you're being very, very...
5393560	5397280	And it's just like, it's like fucking Konami, you know, with, well, if you really want this
5397280	5400080	game to come out, you better have those pre-orders in!
5400080	5403520	I mean, fuck you, I'm not buying your goddamn game then.
5403520	5407040	I don't give a shit if you put it out, because it will probably suck anyways, because all
5407040	5411480	of your games, you know, especially music games, they have really blown.
5411480	5415720	I like doing the pre-orders to determine things, because that's how we got the low cost on
5415720	5417000	the Macross box sets.
5417000	5420280	I like how the random-ass DDR, just, we can never get away from that.
5420280	5421280	Alright.
5421280	5423000	Well, no, it's because they pulled that bullshit.
5423000	5424000	Hey, Capcom!
5424000	5427400	Why don't you step up and do this bullshit, because, you know, this seems perfectly down
5427400	5428400	your alley.
5428400	5429400	Is that what Nintendo should do?
5429400	5432640	Should Nintendo put it up on their website and say, okay, if 10,000 people order Xenoblade,
5432640	5434560	then we'll put it out?
5434560	5437840	If that's what it's going to take for them to do it in a timely manner, then fine.
5437840	5438840	Would you do it?
5438840	5440280	No, because I don't want to buy this fucking game.
5440280	5446200	I don't play the Wii anymore, who do I care?
5446200	5448080	Fuck you, Ronald McDonald!
5448080	5452120	No, I would seriously, I would boycott the game then.
5452120	5453600	Oh, well, you don't want to bring it out?
5453600	5456160	Fine, you just want to put out some more Mario and Kirby games.
5456160	5460160	Kirby, which, by the way, I don't know if anyone still cares about Kirby, but...
5460160	5464280	This is like the opposite of Operation Rainfall.
5464280	5466240	This is Operation Thunder Snow.
5466240	5469840	Yo, fuck those games!
5469840	5474480	I think you should start a campaign on Twitter, Operation Thunder Snow.
5474480	5475600	Don't release those games.
5475600	5478440	In fact, don't buy Wii games.
5478440	5481880	P.S., fuck you, Ronald McDonald.
5481880	5483880	No, seriously, okay, let's see you...
5483880	5489880	Everyone's going to get a fucking raging boner over a goddamn, you know, Skyward Sword.
5489880	5494080	Ooh, it's a Zelda game with stuff in it, I mean...
5494080	5499700	I gotta say, though, the last story looked fucking great, and I was looking forward to
5499700	5502360	seeing that announcement in E3, and would I have bought that on the Wii?
5502360	5504120	Actually, yes, I think I would have.
5504120	5505120	Where are the reviews in Japan?
5505120	5510040	I have one of those boners for Mistwalker that I kind of do for Q Entertainment.
5510040	5513560	Like, even their mediocre games I will still support, like Blue Dragon.
5513560	5515240	Hey, Mistwalker, guess what?
5515240	5519720	Just because you had Nintendo publish your game in fucking Japan, you know what?
5519720	5521320	Other companies will fucking publish it over here.
5521320	5524220	You don't even have to go through all this bullshit of having to beg a company to bring
5524220	5525220	it out.
5525220	5526220	Because guess what?
5526220	5528560	There's companies like Ignition that have said, hey, you know what?
5528560	5532600	We're going to try our own internal game development, but that went up in smoke, so we're going
5532600	5535880	to go and shop games that people want to be brought over here, and we're going to bring
5535880	5536880	them over here.
5536880	5539880	Or there's a company called Axis Game Localization.
5539880	5541440	They localize games!
5541440	5544360	That's all they fucking do is localize games!
5544360	5550240	They bring over shit like BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2, and shit like that Guilty Gear that
5550240	5555640	you would never, ever fucking play if, you know, you relied on Nintendo to bring that
5555640	5556640	shit.
5556640	5558580	Do you know how many decibels I've taken down your mic this episode and it's still
5558580	5560480	not enough because you keep getting louder?
5560480	5563800	Sorry, I'm just saying that you're just passionate.
5563800	5564800	I am.
5564800	5565800	I'm seriously passionate about it.
5565800	5570640	The fact is, I don't think that it should result in people begging a company like Nintendo
5570640	5573180	to try to get them to understand the niche market.
5573180	5576520	You need companies that already understand the niche market and will bring this shit
5576520	5577720	over regardless.
5577720	5580560	Let me let me ask this and then we can move on with more stories because we're an hour
5580560	5583520	and a half into the show and haven't got to the end of party yet.
5583520	5587100	What is your passion?
5587100	5589920	My passion as far as these games go.
5589920	5592680	Why do these stories get you so angry?
5592680	5599400	Because it's this whole, oh, we're this big company and we're just, you know, you should
5599400	5601400	be gracious for everything they were putting out.
5601400	5605760	And they just don't, they think they understand what their users want and they don't.
5605760	5610500	I mean, their whole focus on, oh, let's, you know, make sure that we're putting out games
5610500	5616240	that families want to play and elderly people want to play so we can sell lots of Wii systems
5616240	5620360	and then they get all these systems out and it's like, hey, there's some really good games
5620360	5624760	that, you know, kind of go towards the niche market of say people are like, you know, Japanese
5624760	5629080	role playing games, something that's really been underrepresented on the Wii system.
5629080	5633280	And we could bring this stuff over because we know we're doing the translation for Europe
5633280	5638500	because, hey, they're a smaller market and I guess that makes it worth translating the
5638500	5640400	game for it.
5640400	5644120	We could bring this over here with little effort whatsoever, but no, we're going to
5644120	5646200	be assholes and say basically, no, we don't.
5646200	5649520	We don't have any plans on doing this and yeah, I know that you guys all rallied and
5649520	5653920	really want this stuff over here and have committed to really going to buy this stuff,
5653920	5656880	but you know what we're going to do and say we're going to put out another Kirby game
5656880	5663120	or maybe another, you know, Mario basketball game or some bullshit like that because we
5663120	5668020	know that Mario will sell and it requires very little effort on our part and really
5668020	5671340	that's what we want to do is spend the least amount of effort possible.
5671340	5676600	DJ Morpheus in our time says Loki needs Prozac flavored bacon.
5676600	5678840	I really want bacon flavored like medicine.
5678840	5679840	That's disgusting.
5679840	5681960	Why would you want to flavor bacon?
5681960	5684320	I think you meant bacon flavored Prozac.
5684320	5686280	All right.
5686280	5688040	Skye is Loki turning green yet?
5688040	5689040	Nope.
5689040	5690040	Still as white as you can believe.
5690040	5693920	All right, let's move on with another news story and then we'll get into the release
5693920	5694920	dates.
5694920	5695920	Dark Sakura.
5695920	5696920	Oh, Nintendo.
5696920	5702460	You've been a very quiet lady over there and usually you're the opinionated one.
5702460	5705360	So I've got to know what is your thought on all this mess?
5705360	5707480	Like Nintendo not releasing these.
5707480	5708480	Are they being hard-headed?
5708480	5711280	Is does it make good business sense?
5711280	5714180	I say it's average for Nintendo.
5714180	5715360	This is just par for the course.
5715360	5717640	I'm used to this shit.
5717640	5720200	This is why you've just become desensitized to this.
5720200	5721200	Pretty much.
5721200	5724480	It's basically people- And not like I play my Wii anymore.
5724480	5725760	Nintendo does something wrong.
5725760	5729560	Nikki yells and screams about it, lather, rinse, repeat for the past nine years.
5729560	5732960	It's basically, people are, they're barking up the wrong tree.
5732960	5736160	They're asking Nintendo to bring over this really niche game when they should really
5736160	5741200	be bugging these other publishers that put stuff out on the Wii as well as other systems
5741200	5742520	to bring over the games.
5742520	5746640	Because I think these people like, you know, like Atlas, there's another perfect example
5746640	5748080	of a company that would do this.
5748080	5751000	They, that's all they deal with is niche shit.
5751000	5752000	All right, we get it.
5752000	5755000	We need the return of working designs.
5755000	5760120	You know, I actually, one of our pinball tables belongs to the owner of working designs.
5760120	5761120	Oh really?
5761120	5762120	Our Twilight Zone.
5762120	5763120	That's kind of rad actually.
5763120	5764120	That's how we got our Goemon doll.
5764120	5765120	All right, let's move on.
5765120	5766120	More gaming news.
5766120	5768800	And uh, oh god, it's another Nintendo story, isn't it?
5768800	5773600	Yeah, I'll- Oh god, get your earmuffs!
5773600	5782400	Nintendo plans on spending 16.5 billion yen on a new research and design facility in Kyoto.
5782400	5788000	This was reported by Miike, which is the Japanese stock market, that they're going to start
5788000	5792840	building in January 2012 and will be finished by the end of 2013.
5792840	5800180	And they have had this in the works since 2009, but the original price they had on it
5800180	5803960	was 12 billion yen.
5803960	5809000	They basically are trying to move everything into one house.
5809000	5816000	They are bringing in their R&D offices, all of the main staff.
5816000	5819640	Everything is going to be under one roof.
5819640	5826400	So Loki, 16.5 billion yen on a new research and design facility, yet no last story.
5826400	5827400	What are your thoughts?
5827400	5830920	Maybe that's why I spent all this money on a new building.
5830920	5835160	Well they want to put everyone under one roof, I don't see a problem with that.
5835160	5836160	Apple's doing the same thing.
5836160	5838320	They're building some giant space saucer thing.
5838320	5842400	They're building a metal donut in the middle of San Jose.
5842400	5847040	There's no square wall in the building or something like that.
5847040	5851760	They actually wanted to make a building that looks like Steve Job's asshole.
5851760	5855200	That's what they're building in the middle of San Jose.
5855200	5858640	So everybody can literally walk up his ass day in and day out.
5858640	5862160	And it's going to be all made of glass.
5862160	5863560	I can actually point out something.
5863560	5868560	There is a psychological reason that you want to remove hard edges is that it reduces the
5868560	5869880	urge for violence.
5869880	5873480	Oh, because when I think of Apple products, I think of violence.
5873480	5875200	Loki, maybe.
5875200	5876960	Maybe it's to make happier workers.
5876960	5878440	Wow, really?
5878440	5883920	I know people that would kill someone, literally kill someone in the dead of night to get a
5883920	5884920	job at Apple.
5884920	5887480	Like, I don't think of Apple as having angry workers.
5887480	5892480	I wouldn't do that, no.
5892480	5899800	The whole, like, fact that, you know, it's been shown that circle buildings or whatever
5899800	5901760	cause people not to be violent.
5901760	5905920	Sounds like the hippie mumbo jumbo that Steve Jobs would be spouting anyways.
5905920	5906920	But you know what?
5906920	5907920	Hectagons piss me off.
5907920	5913840	No, I think the whole thing is that he didn't like being called a square.
5913840	5914840	So that's why.
5914840	5915840	So, ha!
5915840	5916840	You can't call me a square now.
5916840	5917840	You're a fucking idiot.
5917840	5918840	And a hippie.
5918840	5921960	We're going to plant some trees.
5921960	5922960	Go plant some trees, Steve.
5922960	5926200	Well, actually, we're going to plant a lot of trees.
5926200	5927600	Don't need to prove me right anymore.
5927600	5931840	I like how Loki had a wide open door to do more Nintendo bashing and he decided to take
5931840	5932840	a pass.
5932840	5933840	He just...
5933840	5936440	What am I going to say about Nintendo opening a facility?
5936440	5937440	Good for them.
5937440	5938440	They're opening a building.
5938440	5941040	It's not like this facility is going to research more Mario games.
5941040	5942920	I mean, I don't know.
5942920	5943920	I was...
5943920	5944920	It's just...
5944920	5945920	They're consolidating their stuff.
5945920	5950080	Let me get you a little platter and I'm going to hand you the joke on the platter, okay?
5950080	5951080	Here it is.
5951080	5952080	Look at this.
5952080	5953080	They're building a...
5953080	5957120	They're putting all these billions of dollars into a research facility for all those new
5957120	5959000	franchises they put out.
5959000	5960700	There you go, Loki.
5960700	5961700	It's not...
5961700	5963100	Hey, you know what?
5963100	5966040	I don't believe they research shit for any of their franchises.
5966040	5967960	So that's obviously not what it's for.
5967960	5971520	It's for their new consoles that are so innovative and different from their last console.
5971520	5975840	In fact, this new console, what, it has a tablet for a controller.
5975840	5979160	That's such a genius idea that they need a new research facility.
5979160	5985400	Certainly an idea like that only could have come out of a building shaved like a donut.
5985400	5990600	Basically quite a number of articles I just randomly found from anthropologists, different
5990600	5995300	biologists, psychologists, all pointing to the...
5995300	6001000	By the circle is a comforting and familiar shape to the mind on an unconscious level.
6001000	6002000	I understand that.
6002000	6010720	Well, as in art, we study the golden mean as a curve, so that it's like the shape of
6010720	6018720	a shell, the circular shape of a shell, why a more circular face in some cultures is considered
6018720	6019720	to be more attractive.
6019720	6022480	They look for symmetry.
6022480	6024520	The hecticons are still very rude, right?
6024520	6026040	Yes, they are.
6026040	6030440	So for the record, there actually is psychology behind it.
6030440	6033480	I don't believe in psychology.
6033480	6038560	That's clear.
6038560	6041640	There's that witty retort I've been waiting for all night.
6041640	6044480	All right, let's move on to release dates.
6044480	6047360	We're going to travel the world and check out what's coming out to a store near you
6047360	6049600	and eventually we'll get through this show.
6049600	6054520	Loki, I'll save yourself some time because there's only one thing that's coming out this
6054520	6059160	week that you really need to pick up and that would be Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.
6059160	6066280	And that's, of course, assuming that they didn't release it on Saturday wherever you
6066280	6067920	live, because that was the case.
6067920	6071280	In fact, since we're getting into it now, I will explain why it's being released on
6071280	6076840	Saturday because it's a funny story, actually, and it also goes to show you GameStop.
6076840	6078240	They're fucking assholes.
6078240	6080600	Okay, so get this.
6080600	6083040	D3, they put out the game.
6083040	6085920	They shipped it to stores or whatever like that early and stuff like that.
6085920	6092960	They misprinted the street date number on the master cases that went out.
6092960	6096900	So it said, Streets July 2nd, despite the fact that all their paperwork, the street
6096900	6099240	date letters, et cetera, say July 5th.
6099240	6102320	GameStop's going, no taking backsies, no taking backsies.
6102320	6103400	It fucking says the second.
6103400	6107780	We're putting it on the second on all systems, even though it was only the 360 master cases
6107780	6110520	that they messed up on.
6110520	6115880	Instead of D3 saying, hey, GameStop, I understand that we did misprint that on there.
6115880	6117920	But the street date is still the fifth.
6117920	6118920	Could you put it on the fifth?
6118920	6119920	They're like, fuck you.
6119920	6122080	We're putting it out whenever we goddamn feel like it.
6122080	6123800	And so that's kind of what happened.
6123800	6124800	And because...
6124800	6125800	Pinchpoke, you owe me a Coke.
6125800	6127120	No take backsies.
6127120	6133200	It's basically now everybody's kind of putting it out because, well, GameStop's doing it.
6133200	6134840	And they advertise it on the website.
6134840	6136840	They call it all their pre-order customers.
6136840	6137840	They're assholes.
6137840	6140320	But hey, you know what?
6140320	6143120	The benefit of it is that you get to play the game early.
6143120	6146440	And a lot of people are going to be putting it out as well other than GameStop early.
6146440	6151120	So you know, bug killing on the 4th of July doesn't sound too bad.
6151120	6154320	So the moral of the story is D3, learn to type.
6154320	6155320	Yes.
6155320	6160200	And that's coming out on PS3 and 360 this week.
6160200	6164780	And I kid you not, that's literally the only thing that's coming out this week.
6164780	6167880	Let's go to Japan and look at the releases there coming out in Japan this week.
6167880	6171240	Also their own version of Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon comes out this week on the
6171240	6173120	360 as well as Knight's Contract.
6173120	6175520	L.A. Noire finally gets a release this week on the 360.
6175520	6178320	I'm not sure how localized that game is for Japan.
6178320	6182520	I imagine for it to have come out this fast, it's probably just subtitles and not full
6182520	6184400	redone stuff, especially with all the actors and stuff.
6184400	6185400	It's probably subtitles.
6185400	6187240	I'm going to just guess on that.
6187240	6191800	On the PlayStation 3, Angel Senki comes out as well as Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.
6191800	6194200	Infamous 2 gets its Japanese release this week.
6194200	6195880	Just Cause 2 gets a price reduction.
6195880	6201800	Knight's Contract, L.A. Noire, a game called R.U.S.E. moves into the Ubisoft best collection,
6201800	6203600	Tom Clancy's Hawks 2.
6203600	6206600	Also a best collection price reduction this week on the PS3.
6206600	6209480	It's a busy week on the PlayStation 3.
6209480	6214920	Moving on to other consoles, let's see if I can get to the Wii or the 3DS here, my list.
6214920	6221960	Oh, my list is starting to show Vita releases, but not until December over in Japan.
6221960	6222960	No hard dates yet.
6222960	6225200	I think those are all placeholders, just so you know.
6225200	6230560	Sony PSP, Suzumiya Haruichan no Mahjong.
6230560	6233640	They're doing a Haruhi Mahjong game?
6233640	6236160	Yeah, look at that, right there.
6236160	6237160	Check that out.
6237160	6238160	I play it.
6238160	6239160	And it's Mahjong.
6239160	6240160	There you go.
6240160	6243200	I don't know how to play Mahjong, you should teach me.
6243200	6244520	You've never played Mahjong?
6244520	6249640	Okay, I played Shanghai on the old Macintosh, I don't think that counts.
6249640	6250640	That's Mahjong Solitaire.
6250640	6253400	I'm talking about, like, for real, Mahjong.
6253400	6254400	Oh, okay.
6254400	6255400	All right.
6255400	6260400	Tekken 6 gets a price reduction this week on the PSP.
6260400	6264680	Let's see, the Nintendo Wii, a red Wii remote plus control.
6264680	6266800	That's all that's coming out on the Wii this week.
6266800	6274520	But 3DS gets a couple games, Dr. Lotrek Toboyaku no Kishidan comes out from Konami.
6274520	6275920	This is...
6275920	6279680	It's Dr. Lork in the, I don't remember the fucking subtitle to it.
6279680	6280680	Okay, so it's that game.
6280680	6282080	It's from Konami, it's coming out in September.
6282080	6284280	So it's not Professor Layton.
6284280	6288320	It's very similar to Professor Layton, but it's not.
6288320	6291360	Next week, by the way, in Japan, you can look forward to this, not this week, next week,
6291360	6297400	the 14th, the Flare Red 3DS and Star Fox 64 are the big releases in Japan next week.
6297400	6299280	UK.
6299280	6305080	One thing Virtua Tennis 4 on the 8th for PC.
6305080	6306080	That's it.
6306080	6307080	Oh, hooray.
6307080	6308080	I love tennis.
6308080	6309080	Moving on.
6309080	6311280	Who plays tennis on the PC?
6311280	6315160	Couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're gonna get to the classic game of
6315160	6316160	the week.
6316160	6319360	And I'll tell you what, this week's classic game of the week is old.
6319360	6321760	No, really old, you guys.
6321760	6322760	Yeah, it is.
6322760	6323760	All right.
6323760	6324760	Loki.
6324760	6330320	Um, game for Windows, well, at least the marketplace is gonna be no longer, is actually merging
6330320	6335000	with Xbox.com on July 11th.
6335000	6338760	And that's all you need to know, I guess.
6338760	6344840	They tried to overhaul it back in November, and no one cared.
6344840	6347440	So now it's gonna be part of the Xbox marketplace.
6347440	6348800	Awesome.
6348800	6350440	This actually kind of makes sense.
6350440	6354440	I mean, games for Windows was having a hard time kind of finding its market, especially
6354440	6360960	versus Steam, to merge all the gaming into one place and to really kind of homogenize,
6360960	6366920	if you will, the Xbox gamertag and the experience and all that, bringing that, you know, connect
6366920	6370600	to PCs even and all that, kind of bringing that all together.
6370600	6372520	That all seems kind of smart for Microsoft.
6372520	6375480	So this seems logical.
6375480	6378040	So I guess there's really not a lot else to say on that.
6378040	6379040	Nope.
6379040	6382640	It'll be interesting, though, what will happen with the Windows 8 integration.
6382640	6385520	That's what I'm most curious about, because you know it'll somehow integrate into Windows
6385520	6386520	8.
6386520	6393720	And I'm really curious how Microsoft is going to tie together the 360 and Windows 8.
6393720	6396280	Now there's only so much they can do, because, you know, they don't want to get...
6396280	6398680	Well, the new interface looks like Windows 8.
6398680	6400260	That's an optional interface, though.
6400260	6401260	That's one thing that...
6401260	6402260	Thank God.
6402260	6405680	...they haven't been... that was one type of interface that you can have.
6405680	6407840	Like Windows will still have the traditional way of doing it.
6407840	6408840	Oh, wait.
6408840	6409840	That's right.
6409840	6410840	Optional on Windows.
6410840	6411840	My mistake.
6411840	6412840	You know.
6412840	6413840	Required on 360.
6413840	6414840	So.
6414840	6418020	Well, it's just like, what is that thing called?
6418020	6421160	The multimedia Windows thing that you can do on the 360?
6421160	6422160	I know.
6422160	6423160	Windows Media Center.
6423160	6424360	Windows Live or whatever.
6424360	6427800	Like, you know, that was a lot of what was shown in Windows 7, but how many people really
6427800	6428800	use that?
6428800	6429800	Like, I can't use that in my house.
6429800	6431160	It's too damn slow.
6431160	6434200	So I don't know how many people use that, but there you go.
6434200	6435200	All right.
6435200	6437600	Anyhow, one other story for you guys, and then we'll get into the Classic Game of the
6437600	6438600	Week.
6438600	6441160	This is about a different classic game, GoldenEye.
6441160	6446100	A domain has been spotted for a game called GoldenEye Reloaded.
6446100	6447100	Not just one domain.
6447100	6448360	A bunch of games.
6448360	6454680	Is it possible that last year's Wii game will be coming out on the 360 and PS3?
6454680	6456600	Could it maybe be getting a sequel?
6456600	6458840	Nobody or could it just mean fucking nothing?
6458840	6464440	It could be any of the above, but that domain has been spotted and it indicates that GoldenEye
6464440	6468640	is not quite dead, even though the Wii version got kind of lukewarm reviews.
6468640	6472680	But what would happen if that game came out in HD on the 360 or PS3?
6472680	6475520	That I would say that's actually kind of rad if that happens.
6475520	6480320	Someone had already done the translation to, like, HD already, but it got kind of tied
6480320	6483960	up with the whole rights being owned by different people.
6483960	6488240	Yeah, but does Activision pretty much solely own the James Bond stuff now?
6488240	6495320	Yeah, but I think that's why GoldenEye came out on the Wii and not on the other systems,
6495320	6499600	because the other James Bond games are terrible.
6499600	6503280	All right, let's go to the gaming vault.
6503280	6508840	And we're going to take a stroll down the gaming lane and find a classic video game
6508840	6513720	in the vault that Dark Soccer says, hey, you kids need to respect where your games come
6513720	6514720	from.
6514720	6518160	You know, you wouldn't have Earth Defense, Forts, Insect, Armageddon.
6518160	6522000	You wouldn't have The Last Story or any of these games if it weren't for games such as
6522000	6523000	this one.
6523000	6524880	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
6524880	6528200	This is a game that I played when I was five years old.
6528200	6530760	Wow, so this would have been like 50 years ago?
6530760	6531760	Shut up.
6531760	6532760	Just kidding.
6532760	6537840	It's called The Quest for the Rings, and it was on the Odyssey 2 and video pack.
6537840	6540880	Came out in 1981.
6540880	6543880	Let's listen to some of those bleeps and bloops.
6543880	6548160	Yep, that's what the game sounds like.
6548160	6550520	That's when it's having you pick your class.
6550520	6554080	Let me get to something like...
6554080	6557680	That's going to hurt our listeners' ears, but there you go, it's in the background.
6557680	6558680	I love this game.
6558680	6564880	And keep in mind, I played this game actually for a few years, because when I moved next
6564880	6569240	door to a couple other friends, they had an Odyssey 2.
6569240	6572720	So I got to play it again, and I loved the game even over the years.
6572720	6577920	But okay, Quest for the Rings basically was sort of...
6577920	6581560	It's what Gauntlet should have been based off of.
6581560	6587760	It was very gauntlet-y, but you know, this came out, you know, four years before Gauntlet
6587760	6589920	existed.
6589920	6592600	It had a board game released with it.
6592600	6595560	It was a combination of a video game and a board game.
6595560	6602640	Came in this huge-ass box, it was gorgeous, and you had one person who was the ringmaster.
6602640	6608320	So sort of like a combination between playing the D&D board game and playing Gauntlet, you
6608320	6609320	know.
6609320	6616320	So, you could play the board game with the stuff that would go on in the Quest mode,
6616320	6620800	or you could actually just play the game in Quest mode and play through the different
6620800	6621800	levels.
6621800	6627240	This was the game that I was trying to remember the name of, like, a few episodes ago.
6627240	6630260	So you had four classes that you could play as.
6630260	6635400	You could be a warrior, who, he can, you know, kill stuff.
6635400	6641200	You could be a wizard who can stun other, you know, enemies.
6641200	6650160	You could also be a changeling, who could turn invisible, except when the changeling
6650160	6653760	was invisible, you couldn't see him either.
6653760	6657560	And then there was the phantom, who could walk through all kinds of walls, except for
6657560	6660560	one kind, and he did it at half-speed.
6660560	6665000	Which actually, I would usually pick either the phantom or the changeling, but the phantom
6665000	6669680	was super convenient to have, because there were levels later on where the walls would
6669680	6671720	change location.
6671720	6672960	It was super aggravating.
6672960	6676320	Okay, the gameplay video stopped because there was only about two minutes of it, but can
6676320	6680120	I, I found this related video that I'd seen before that's actually pretty funny.
6680120	6681960	This is how games were marketed back then.
6681960	6684880	I want to play the commercial for this game real quick.
6684880	6691880	Wizard of Odyssey, is the keyboard really the key to greater challenge in video games?
6691880	6692880	Of course it is.
6692880	6694880	You can play strategy games like Quest for the Rings.
6694880	6696880	Plan your strategy on the game board.
6696880	6699880	Use the keyboard to change heroes, enemies, racers.
6699880	6702880	Be a wizard, ultimate, fire a dragon.
6702880	6703880	Take that dragon.
6703880	6705880	We wizards hate to lose.
6705880	6709880	Master strategy series, only from Odyssey 2, where the keyboard is the key to greater
6709880	6710880	challenge.
6710880	6715880	By Odyssey, get $82 worth of free games, including Quest for the Rings and Pickaxe Pete.
6715880	6716880	Take that dragon.
6716880	6718880	I had pick, we had Pickaxe Pete too.
6718880	6722880	Dude, just $82 worth of games, so that was $41 a piece.
6722880	6729880	So this game, with its bleepy bloops, $41 in 19, what is this commercial, 1981 I think?
6729880	6730880	Yeah.
6730880	6731880	Was this commercial?
6731880	6733880	And that's, I mean games were expensive.
6733880	6734880	Yeah.
6734880	6735880	So.
6735880	6736880	Now.
6736880	6737880	It's interesting too that they used the keyboard.
6737880	6738880	It's really the niche for the Odyssey.
6738880	6742880	I guess just be competitive with the 2600, like real gaming uses a keyboard.
6742880	6744880	Which is funny because that argument is still used today.
6744880	6752480	Well, the other thing with, with the Odyssey 2 is that it was also advertised as an educational
6752480	6755080	system too, because there were a number of educational games on it.
6755080	6759880	Like one that we used to play all the time was Crypt Equip, where you put in a word.
6759880	6760880	Okay.
6760880	6764420	Well, we're still talking classic into the week, so.
6764420	6769440	You put in a word and then it scrambles it, and we would always pick one person in our
6769440	6774640	group that had to unscramble the word, and so they'd have us face the wall, except whenever
6774640	6778520	it was me, I mean I was always really good at it anyway, but the wall that they would
6778520	6781280	have us face had a mirror on it.
6781280	6785440	And I've been able to read backwards since I've been able to read.
6785440	6787280	So it was never that difficult.
6787280	6792200	And this also was a system that had K.C. Munchkin, or was it Munchkin or Crazy Chase that was
6792200	6793200	the Pac-Man clone?
6793200	6794720	K.C. Munchkin I think it's called.
6794720	6795720	Yeah.
6795720	6798400	Which I've actually got a couple copies of.
6798400	6800880	But there was a cease and desist put on them.
6800880	6805560	So to find, I mean it's not really super expensive, but to find a copy of K.C. Munchkin is, you
6805560	6807320	know, kind of a find.
6807320	6809920	So what made this game awesome to a five year old?
6809920	6814960	Well, it was just that you could, you know, you could fight a dragon, but the dragon,
6814960	6817520	you know, you couldn't kill the dragon.
6817520	6820840	And it was just an adventure game, like look how awesome the dragon looked.
6820840	6822720	The big green blip.
6822720	6823720	That was serious graphics!
6823720	6824720	Godzilla!
6824720	6825720	It's Godzilla!
6825720	6831160	I'm going to show everybody what this picture looks like, because I mean seriously, that
6831160	6835920	was pretty hardcore awesome graphics for, you know, when I was five.
6835920	6839720	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6839720	6840720	Oh, I'm sorry, there's more?
6840720	6841720	Yes!
6841720	6842720	Oh, it sounded like we were done.
6842720	6843720	Alright, then what else?
6843720	6846480	Well, I was going to tell you about the other things that were in the game.
6846480	6847480	Oh, okay, well please do.
6847480	6849480	Well then let me restart the music.
6849480	6855160	You had five kinds of monsters, and they had the most awesome names.
6855160	6861040	There were orcs and fire wraiths, who were really, they actually looked just alike except
6861040	6862040	they were different colors.
6862040	6863040	One was pink, one was blue.
6863040	6866400	Then you had dragons, which they basically moved left and right across the screen, but
6866400	6870600	if you got in the way, they'd be like ROAR and run at you, and it would be like, oh shit,
6870600	6872400	it's a dragon!
6872400	6878120	And there was the nightmares that had different names.
6878120	6883320	There was Spidroth Tarantulas, which is a giant spider, and Doomed Wing Bloodthirst,
6883320	6890040	which makes me think that the designers of WoW played this game and took inspiration
6890040	6892720	from the characters in the game.
6892720	6899720	But I mean, I always, this is one game that I seriously thought they should totally remake,
6899720	6906520	because it was just, the theory behind it was so awesome.
6906520	6908740	It really was.
6908740	6916040	It was simple, simple gameplay, but it did it so effectively that I don't think any other
6916040	6921300	game has been, you know, if I'm looking back to this as one of my favorite classic games
6921300	6927400	ever, then, you know, it's gotta have something, say something for it's staying power.
6927400	6932280	But I'll go ahead and actually link what the cover looked like in the chat room, because
6932280	6936000	it had a really epic 80's cover, because, man, that's when people actually drew shit
6936000	6937000	by hand.
6937000	6938000	Alright, I'm done.
6938000	6943440	Classic giveaway of the week, the quest for the rings for the Odyssey 2.
6943440	6944440	Damn that's old.
6944440	6948040	Alright, we're gonna take a break here, but don't worry, there's plenty more of Orange
6948040	6951480	Launch Radio to come, thank god there's no work tomorrow.
6951480	6952560	Fear!
6952560	6954520	So yep, we can stay up late a little bit.
6954520	6955520	Pinkberry run!
6955520	6959520	Pinkberry closes at 10, we're not gonna be done by 10, I hate to break it to you.
6959520	6961160	I'll send the husband to come get it.
6961160	6963160	Now that I can play into.
6963160	6967640	Alright, we gotta take a break though, when we come back, there's plenty more Orange Launch
6967640	6971040	Radio to come, we're gonna talk about Portal 2, we're gonna talk Minecraft, we're gonna
6971040	6976480	talk DDR again, somehow it's making its way into the show, PSP remasters, and plenty more
6976480	6977560	when we come back.

6981880	6992120	so we can talk about that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

7039360	7040680	You're thinking of vanilla ice.
7040680	7042640	No, maybe this lovely cup of ice water I have.

7055680	7060560	While you're out shopping for podcasts, might I recommend one of our other Orange Lounge
7060560	7066840	production shows, I guess you could say, The Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth, www.hoardhouse.com.
7066840	7072680	It's a show about the world of Warcraft and it's myself and Extifer doing lolsy Warcraft
7072680	7075420	chat and this week was a real fun show.
7075420	7081000	We talked a lot, there was a brand new patch in WoW this week, 4.2, and also huge news
7081000	7082000	about Warcraft.
7082000	7085120	It didn't make this show roll, probably because I already talked about it on Hoard House,
7085120	7089080	but WoW has gone free to play in some ways.
7089080	7095160	Level 20, basically what existed as the free trial before is now an unlimited trial, it's
7095160	7098760	not capped to 14 days, so you can play all the way to level 20.
7098760	7101480	Lots of restrictions with that though, I don't think you can join a guild or what have you,
7101480	7105240	but more information about the Hoard House Guild and all that stuff is on hoardhouse.com.
7105240	7108560	Now DarkStalker, I understand you guested on a Warcraft show this week, right?
7108560	7109560	Yes I did.
7109560	7110560	Can we talk about it?
7110560	7111560	Yeah!
7111560	7112560	Ok, cool.
7112560	7118020	I was on Girls Gone WoW, which you can go to their website at girlsgonewow.net and they
7118020	7119480	are UK players.
7119480	7120480	Yes.
7120480	7124600	Which, we actually got into a discussion about, we really wish that there was some way that
7124600	7129800	we could cross zones in play, because you can't play on...
7129800	7133640	Oh yeah, it's one of the biggest drawbacks of WoW is that there's no way for us to roll
7133640	7138760	on Europe and they can't roll on us, unless you actually buy that region's copy of the
7138760	7141600	freaking game and do it that way, and it's kind of a pain in the ass.
7141600	7142600	That's butt-tarded.
7142600	7147360	So, but the host over there still, we're good net friends, because she's been on Hoard House
7147360	7149840	a couple of times now and always brings the lulz.
7149840	7151760	But I signed up on their forums.
7151760	7152760	They're fun people.
7152760	7153760	Great!
7153760	7158920	And we had a really, really good time, really long discussion.
7158920	7164040	I hope to go back again, prospects seem hopeful.
7164040	7165040	Excellent!
7165040	7169200	And they were just great people, all three of them, I really enjoyed the time I had.
7169200	7170200	Wonderful!
7170200	7172720	Don't you just love, what's her name, EJ's accent?
7172720	7173720	Yes.
7173720	7174720	Love her accent.
7174720	7175720	Love it.
7175720	7178000	I just want to put it in a little voice box and open it.
7178000	7179400	The haters are gonna hate.
7179400	7183520	She says, fuck all, better than anyone I've ever heard.
7183520	7188440	Okay, by the way, we got a tweet from the Girls Gone WoW show on Twitter, at twitter.com
7188440	7191620	slash o-l-r is our Twitter and ggwshow is theirs.
7191620	7194240	I loved having DarkSakura on our podcast.
7194240	7195360	She was an amazing guest.
7195360	7199160	I'm in your show, kidnapping your host, kisses.
7199160	7200160	So.
7200160	7201160	Okay.
7201160	7202160	Hey!
7202160	7203160	No!
7203160	7204160	You're here first.
7204160	7206720	I'll call you to that chair.
7206720	7208880	No, I think that's great.
7208880	7213560	Also, since I said it on Bobby's show tonight, I guess we could say it here.
7213560	7218080	There is a third podcast in the works.
7218080	7219080	Yes, there is.
7219080	7222740	And we're looking at taping the pilot in the next week or so.
7222740	7225100	And I'm hoping we'll have more information soon.
7225100	7226760	But that's all you get.
7226760	7227760	I can say one thing.
7227760	7228760	What's that?
7228760	7229760	It will involve a Dan.
7229760	7230760	Okay, we can say that.
7230760	7232280	Yep, it will involve Dan.
7232280	7233280	It will involve Dan.
7233280	7234280	Yeah, we're gonna leave it at that.
7234280	7235280	I said a Dan.
7235280	7236280	A Dan.
7236280	7237280	It did not say which Dan.
7237280	7240280	It will involve a Dan.
7240280	7242160	Alright.
7242160	7244780	Let's get into some rapid-fire news.
7244780	7249340	Let's go to the news that there's lots of news this week and some of it we just don't
7249340	7253040	have time to talk 15 minutes about like we did some of those Nintendo stories tonight.
7253040	7255320	Loki, why don't you start us off?
7255320	7256320	Uh, yes.
7256320	7257320	This is kinda neat.
7257320	7261920	Kotaku, I don't know if they've been doing the actual translations themselves, but they've
7261920	7271200	been running on their website every Thursday starting a couple weeks ago, localized versions
7271200	7272880	of Retro Game Master.
7272880	7279320	Now for those who haven't heard of Retro Game Master, it's a show in Japan that has this
7279320	7284980	game master who plays through old classic games and there's kind of commentary going
7284980	7285980	along with it.
7285980	7289840	So it's like the same thing I see on billions of YouTube channels and just on TV.
7289840	7294160	But it's funny, you know, he has trouble with some of the games and it's his commentary.
7294160	7295960	Professionally written, I guess?
7295960	7298320	I guess, I don't know.
7298320	7302680	So the first episode was Ninja Gaiden and then of course this week's episode was Super
7302680	7304200	Fantasy Zone.
7304200	7310120	But you can check them out, they're streaming, like I said, every Thursday on their Thursday
7310120	7314460	at 8pm Eastern is when they have the thing going.
7314460	7315720	So check it out.
7315720	7319560	I mean, this is the type of stuff that should have been on G4 back in the day when they
7319560	7320560	talked about games.
7320560	7324120	That was the Portal 2 information.
7324120	7325120	Portal 2...
7325120	7326120	Can I back up real quick?
7326120	7329440	Sorry, I was talking to our chatters who now, of course, are asking a ton of questions on
7329440	7333040	that little tease about the other podcast.
7333040	7336240	They teamed up with Kotaku to put the episodes out?
7336240	7337240	Yes.
7337240	7338240	That's interesting.
7338240	7340880	I mean, I'm not going to Kotaku, it's a fine website, what have you, but it's just interesting.
7340880	7351440	It's not like a big Hulu or Netflix or even YouTube, it's a very kind of niche gaming
7351440	7352440	site.
7352440	7356040	I mean, it's one of the bigger gaming blogs, certainly, but it's just an interesting path.
7356040	7361080	I don't think of Kotaku television very often, so it's interesting for them.
7361080	7362080	Yeah.
7362080	7369000	So anyways, Portal 2, they had a map contest recently and they've had the winners chosen
7369000	7374440	for that, and it's part of the Summer Mapping Initiative contest.
7374440	7379560	The winning map, I guess a map called Patent Pending, took top prize.
7379560	7386400	Also another called Infinifling, that was, I guess, focusing on mid-air portaling techniques,
7386400	7387400	that was second.
7387400	7392240	And then Endifice, which is based on some destroyed Aperture Chambers, picked up an
7392240	7393240	honorable mention.
7393240	7398760	Now, all these are available to download at, of course, the Portal website, thinkingwithportals.com.
7398760	7404680	And many other user-created levels, so if you've played through Portal 2 already on
7404680	7409640	PC and you want to go back and try some custom maps and stuff, you can go and download these
7409640	7411560	and it's really easy to access them in-game.
7411560	7415320	So I haven't really played around with this yet, but I always thought if this came out
7415320	7418080	it would kind of all be integrated into Steam, but it's not.
7418080	7423800	Like I have to go to this website and do, like, I don't have to hack my game per se,
7423800	7424800	right?
7424800	7425800	But don't I have to have this dev mode or something?
7425800	7426800	No, not really.
7426800	7431800	You just, you pull up the developers, the console in the game by hitting the title key,
7431800	7434400	and then you just, there's a simple command you put in there.
7434400	7435400	Hmm, okay.
7435400	7436400	Well, that's cool.
7436400	7437400	To play the stuff.
7437400	7438400	So, yeah.
7438400	7443200	And, I mean, it'd be kind of cool if they integrated it with, like, some sort of map,
7443200	7446240	you know, option in, like, a menu or something like that where you can just select a map
7446240	7447240	and play it.
7447240	7450640	Or, you know, maybe make multiple maps or something like that so you can have your own
7450640	7451640	single-player campaigns.
7451640	7457000	And, of course, obviously, not something that you're going to be able to play on consoles
7457000	7458000	yet.
7458000	7464600	And then, finally, Left 4 Dead 2, apparently they had a little Easter egg in there.
7464600	7472520	There was a community-made campaign called Suicide Blitz 2 in Left 4 Dead 2, and it's
7472520	7477020	one of the officially featured fan-created add-ons for the game.
7477020	7480800	And it has a very neat Portal 2 Easter egg buried in it.
7480800	7491640	Apparently, if you, um, you find a portal, I guess, into the actual Aperture Science
7491640	7498320	in there, and it says, uh, you can, um, I guess, figure, you find the Aperture Science
7498320	7505040	and also Companion Cube, Propression Gel, Special Infected Zombies, and all sorts of
7505040	7506040	neat stuff.
7506040	7508840	I was watching the video, there was a video attached to the story that had two giggling
7508840	7514080	girls playing the game, and, um, it was, it looked really well done, like, from what I
7514080	7515080	was watching.
7515080	7519080	So, uh, yeah, I mean, it looked like you were frickin' playing Portal, but inside Left 4
7519080	7520080	Dead.
7520080	7522280	So, I like those wacky, zany crossovers.
7522280	7526640	Yes, and I like how you have to find a gnome.
7526640	7527640	Yes.
7527640	7531720	But they have her voice and everything, the infamous GLaDOS voice is in there.
7531720	7533120	So, that's really cool.
7533120	7534120	Very cool.
7534120	7535120	Alright, going to some other stories.
7535120	7538760	Uh, Street Fighter 4, the ports keep on comin'.
7538760	7541160	This one is called Street Fighter 4 Volt.
7541160	7542840	It's coming out on the iPhone.
7542840	7546200	It will have three new fighters and Wi-Fi support.
7546200	7547680	Uh, Volt, it's now available.
7547680	7549160	It's not something you have to wait for.
7549160	7552940	It was announced at a Capcom event in Tokyo, but it's available now.
7552940	7554840	There are three new fighters available.
7554840	7557200	Balrog, Vega, and Cody.
7557200	7560360	Keep in mind that when Street Fighter 4 was ported to the iPhone, not all the fighters
7560360	7562320	from the game made it over.
7562320	7565360	So yes, having some of these characters in it is new.
7565360	7567000	Seventeen fighters available.
7567000	7568000	So there you go.
7568000	7573560	Uh, you can get Volt for a buck, but the price is going up each day by one dollar.
7573560	7576800	So about now, it's about $3.99 or $4.99.
7576800	7580380	On July 6th, the game will be $6.99.
7580380	7581620	That will be its final price.
7581620	7582680	But you know what?
7582680	7586520	They have these 99 cent sales all the time, so if you miss it, you can like wait a month.
7586520	7587520	Just wait.
7587520	7589480	You can do it.
7589480	7591040	That's Street Fighter 4 Volt.
7591040	7596000	Uh, also, uh, in Retro Gaming's Getting Upgrades, Boulder Dash.
7596000	7597240	You remember this game, Boulder Dash?
7597240	7601520	I remember this because this was huge on the Commodore 64, uh, was the series Boulder Dash.
7601520	7606280	And I think a lot of the, um, old PC, er, not PC, sorry, old computing platforms like
7606280	7609400	the Apples and so forth, this game saw some type of port on it.
7609400	7611120	These games were huge back in the 80s.
7611120	7613280	Well, it's getting a remake, I guess you could say.
7613280	7614680	It's an HD update.
7614680	7617880	It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon, July 13th.
7617880	7621880	Uh, it will be just shy of the Summer Arcade promotion.
7621880	7626440	Unfortunately it's going to be going up against Ms. Splosion Man, so, uh, it might fall through
7626440	7630800	the cracks a little bit, but if you're fond of the old game on the 64 or whatever computer
7630800	7634280	back in the day, Boulder Dash XL is on its way.
7634280	7639440	Uh, it will have seven times the amount of caves as the original 1984 version.
7639440	7641520	It's coming out from Calypso Media.
7641520	7646720	There will be a new puzzle mode with items like speed enhancers and telescoping arms,
7646720	7648120	online leaderboards.
7648120	7651000	It will set you back 800 Microsoft points.
7651000	7657640	There will also be a PC version late in the summer if you are a personal computing purist
7657640	7660640	and you don't want to play the game on one of those evil consoles.
7660640	7666040	Speaking of evil consoles, there's more news on the Wii U and, uh, it has to do with the
7666040	7667280	Zelda game.
7667280	7671520	Well, Nintendo has come out and said, hey, that Zelda game that'll inevitably come out
7671520	7676240	on the Wii U, yeah, it's not really going to look like that E3 demo.
7676240	7680960	So that video we showed and all that, that was just, that was all concept videos.
7680960	7683720	So just, just so you know, it's not necessarily what's going to happen.
7683720	7688240	Hey, you remember when we originally showed Zelda on the GameCube and then we put out
7688240	7690640	Wind Waker that was all cel shaded?
7690640	7693320	Yeah, that, that might happen too.
7693320	7699840	This all coming out from an interview with Zelda longtime producer Eiji Onuma who said,
7699840	7703720	so when we show a graphic demo, people think, oh, this is what the next Zelda will look
7703720	7706520	like, but that's not necessarily the case.
7706520	7711200	And, uh, they also cite, again, the Wind Waker GameCube comparison there.
7711200	7715360	So, uh, confirmed Wii U Zelda to be cel shaded, right?
7715360	7716360	Okay.
7716360	7717360	Maybe not quite.
7717360	7719760	Dar Sakura, what do you have for us?
7719760	7720760	Rock Band!
7720760	7722640	Because we like Rock Band.
7722640	7724800	New download content.
7724800	7729640	It will be For What It's Worth by Buffalo Springfield, Man on the Moon by R.E.M., Aerials
7729640	7735600	by System of the Down, Hypnotized by System of the Down, and Turning Japanese by The Vapors.
7735600	7740880	And for Aerials and Turning Japanese and For What It's Worth, there will be Pro Guitar
7740880	7745520	Bass Expansions available for another 80 Microsoft points.
7745520	7746960	Yay.
7746960	7751680	And next up, Final Fantasy Tactics for the iOS is delayed.
7751680	7753960	That's according to Squeenix's Facebook page.
7753960	7760760	Needs a little bit more time, so it's going to be in late July instead of June, um, as
7760760	7761760	they said it would.
7761760	7765240	I think that might be a little old, but it's going to be on, you have to have the bare
7765240	7768200	minimum of an iPhone 3GS to play it.
7768200	7773440	And this is the remake of the Playstation 1 version, so it's the good one.
7773440	7778600	And then, last but not least, oh, you addict people, Minecraft!
7778600	7784160	They passed 10 million registered users.
7784160	7788400	And that's according to Marcus Person's blog.
7788400	7796840	So they are now officially at 10,005,304.
7796840	7800600	The people who actually bought it are in the 2 million range, so.
7800600	7801600	That's still pretty good.
7801600	7805120	2 million copies of the game, 1 out of every 5 are buying it.
7805120	7806120	Yeah.
7806120	7807120	That's not bad.
7807120	7813680	But they say that basically they're getting 42,000 new players registering in the last
7813680	7815680	24 hours.
7815680	7817640	Can I take my registration back?
7817640	7818640	Just kidding.
7818640	7821640	I'm not that big a jerk, I promise.
7821640	7823880	Well yay for Minecraft, and yay for our Twitter!
7823880	7829200	Every week you guys send us tweets at twitter.com slash O-L-R, and we read some of your tweets
7829200	7831280	here live on air.
7831280	7832800	Not a lot of tweets tonight, actually.
7832800	7835800	There's like, not a lot of Twitter news tonight.
7835800	7842840	Uh, MNZeba says this tweet saying, uh, Xenoblade, or Monado, Beginning of the World, is actually
7842840	7849000	number 3 on the Best Sellers in Nintendo Wii Action Games list at Amazon.com.
7849000	7852240	And she gives us a link here to Amazon.com Best Sellers.
7852240	7855600	It's actually up to number 2 now, just so you know.
7855600	7860080	Super Smash Bros. Brawl is the game that's beating it, and it in turn is beating, Monado
7860080	7867520	is beating Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Lego Star Wars.
7867520	7869120	So, interesting.
7869120	7873200	I mean, granted, keep in mind, we are looking at just the action game list.
7873200	7875800	I want to see where it ranks overall.
7875800	7881640	I'm looking at the overall list, and it's number 16.
7881640	7887160	That's still not bad overall, but just so you know, overall, Monado is being beat by
7887160	7895480	a Wii Nunchuck controller in black, and the HD component cable, which is number 8.
7895480	7900480	Another tweet to us from Tiger Claw sends us a tweet saying, Space Station internet
7900480	7903000	too slow for online video games.
7903000	7907720	Uh, let's see, it links us to a Kotaku article here.
7907720	7910040	Regarding life in space, everyone has three questions.
7910040	7911040	How do you poop?
7911040	7913400	Has anyone screwed, and can you play video games up there?
7913400	7915680	They poop in a vacuum tube.
7915680	7916680	It's true.
7916680	7917680	They poop in a vacuum cleaner.
7917680	7919080	Our soccer would know the answer to that.
7919080	7925280	Anyhow, a Canadian astronaut, I didn't know they had astronauts in Canada.
7925280	7926280	Canadians in space.
7926280	7928680	That'd be a great sitcom.
7928680	7934080	Anyhow, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield said that the internet connection aboard the
7934080	7938040	International Space Station is simply too slow for games.
7938040	7943280	He compared it to a 56K dial-up modem, but I guess the reason why it stinks is because
7943280	7946300	of the space station's orbital velocity speed.
7946300	7951960	That thing moves at 5 miles per second, because keep in mind, it's orbiting the Earth.
7951960	7956520	So Hadfield was the first Canadian to walk in space, and he's going to be, he's in line
7956520	7959760	anyway to become the first Canadian commander of the space station.
7959760	7961920	And clearly he must be a gamer.
7961920	7964960	This all came out during a Canada Day event in Edmonton.
7964960	7966600	So thank you for the link, Tiger Claw.
7966600	7969400	Uh, Blinder says it's a tweet.
7969400	7975240	Blinder222, to be specific, on Twitter, says, did any of you play the Uncharted 3 beta?
7975240	7976880	Sadly, I haven't.
7976880	7983000	I want to, but I just registered my PlayStation Plus yesterday, because remember, oh by the
7983000	7987280	way, PSA, it's July 3rd, this is like the last chance for you to get the stuff in the
7987280	7988280	Welcome Back program.
7988280	7990600	You don't have to download that stuff, you just have to pick what you want.
7990600	7991600	Oh, really?
7991600	7992600	I think.
7992600	7993600	I mean, I'm assuming, because it appeared on my-
7993600	7995880	Just fucking download it if you're going to get it.
7995880	7996880	The servers are fine now.
7996880	8002200	No, it appeared on my, uh, my download list now, but it's just, I, you know, because I
8002200	8005800	have my PlayStation up in the front room and I have to drag, you know, an ethernet cable,
8005800	8009760	because remember, old ass PlayStation, no Wi-Fi built in, because it's a 20 gig.
8009760	8015720	Um, so I have to put, um, you know, an ethernet cable, drag it into the front room, and see,
8015720	8020080	last night I wanted to play Earth Defense Force online as well, and yeah, I can do that
8020080	8023480	with my console, but for some reason I wanted to plug it in.
8023480	8029360	Anyhow, uh, yeah, so I, I, I'm going to check it out hopefully in the next week, but I tell
8029360	8031080	you guys, I have like a backlog of games to play.
8031080	8036600	I still have Loki's L.A. Noire, I haven't even touched yet, and I have, um, uh, two
8036600	8040720	racing games that I have for my rental service, and I have touched none of it, because I've
8040720	8043720	been playing this new Warcraft patch, I've been playing the other games I've been talking
8043720	8047000	about, and Final Fantasy 13, I'm up to 30 hours in Final Fantasy 13.
8047000	8048000	Rob.
8048000	8049000	What?
8049000	8050000	Are your racing games PS3, any of them?
8050000	8051960	They're Xbox 360, but they're from my rental service.
8051960	8056880	Oh, I was gonna say, uh, we've got like a huge driving setup for PS3.
8056880	8057880	Oh, fun.
8057880	8059040	Nah, it's 360.
8059040	8065600	I got, it's, uh, Test Drive Unlimited 2, and one of the, one of the Need for Speed games,
8065600	8066600	whatever.
8066600	8067600	Shift 2 Unleashed?
8067600	8068600	Uh, I think it's...
8068600	8069600	Or is it Hot Pursuit?
8069600	8070600	I think it's Hot Pursuit.
8070600	8071600	I don't, I, I have to look.
8071600	8072600	I don't remember.
8072600	8076000	What's the, not, wait, no, isn't Hot Pursuit the one they just announced that isn't even
8076000	8077000	out yet?
8077000	8079680	No, the runs the one they, they announced, Hot Pursuit is the one that came out last
8079680	8080680	November.
8080680	8081880	Oh, that one looks badass, I gotta say.
8081880	8083720	That new one looks fucking rad, I wanna play that.
8083720	8087480	No, Hot Pursuit is the one that came out back in November, Shift 2 Unleashed was the one
8087480	8090880	that's sort of like Project Gotham that came out back in March.
8090880	8093640	And then, uh, yeah, the run's the one that's coming out later on.
8093640	8097320	So yes, at some point, I will get to Uncharted 3 before they close the beta, it's just, you
8097320	8100780	know, I gotta, I actually have a pretty big gaming queue right now of stuff I wanna play,
8100780	8104840	and I'm still trying to beat Final Fantasy 13, which is just, like, I'm, like, so into
8104840	8105840	it right now.
8105840	8106840	And, like, it's spreading.
8106840	8109400	Like, did you see Bobby Blackwolf, our, uh, guy before us here?
8109400	8110400	I should finish mine.
8110400	8114280	He, he posted a tweet last night, he said, you know what?
8114280	8118180	After a year, it's time for me to beat Chapter 10, which is funny, because I didn't struggle
8118180	8119320	on that same boss fight.
8119320	8121720	There were boss fights I struggled on, but not that one.
8121720	8125000	There were some, there were some Eidolon fights that made me wanna just, ugh.
8125000	8131920	I'll have Saz's Eidolon, I, I, I, oh my god, I went crazy on that fight, just so you know.
8131920	8136000	I have to find my save, it's on one of the hard drives I have, because I've swapped hard
8136000	8137000	drives around.
8137000	8140600	I know it's not on that console, because, um, you know, that's the internal hard drive.
8140600	8144520	But I have to track it down, and once I do, then I'll play it.
8144520	8146520	Alright.
8146520	8147520	Let's move on.
8147520	8154360	Uh, another tweet, last tweet here, from TigerClaw305 on Twitter, Professor Layton movie is getting
8154360	8160280	a US release, and, oh, I hate these websites that have ads you have to click through, uh,
8160280	8168080	let's see, um, Professor Layton, a manga and an animated feature film, the latter, Professor
8168080	8173200	Layton and the Eternal Diva, excuse me, was first released in Japan in December 09.
8173200	8176680	It wasn't something you'd necessarily expect to make it out of Japan, but an English version
8176680	8179520	was created for British markets and was released last year.
8179520	8184000	See how they do that Nintendo, they release something that's, you know, English language
8184000	8188200	and release it in British markets, and then they can come over here without any, any effort
8188200	8191020	whatsoever, because it's already translated into English.
8191020	8195400	As revealed at Anime Expo 2011 this weekend, the feature length animated film is on its
8195400	8199160	way to North America, reports Anime Your Way.
8199160	8202680	It was actually fairly well received, and the developer, Level 5, has already commissioned
8202680	8204560	a sequel and would like a new movie out annually.
8204560	8209200	And I'd like to add also, but seeing as we're talking about anime movies coming out soon,
8209200	8212840	um, they announced a Trigun movie coming out, and that's awesome.
8212840	8214200	The trailer, did you watch it?
8214200	8215200	Yes I did.
8215200	8216440	Oh, that's so nice.
8216440	8220160	It will take place, obviously, during the series, because, uh, for, you know, obvious,
8220160	8222160	obvious reasons.
8222160	8225760	But that is very exciting.
8225760	8228800	Alright, that's it for Twitter topics tonight, let's get back to some other gaming news,
8228800	8229800	Loki.
8229800	8233000	Alright, let's talk a little bit about Minecraft, since, uh, we were just talking about Minecraft
8233000	8234000	not too long ago.
8234000	8243360	Uh, Minecraft 1.7 is out now, and it adds pistons and deadly sheep, because, you know,
8243360	8247800	I think that kind of reminds me of, what was it, the black sheep, um, movie that they put
8247800	8249840	out a while ago, where the sheep are zombies.
8249840	8250840	It's funny.
8250840	8254960	Uh, but yes, pistons, though, you can make, uh, more complex machines now, so that's kind
8254960	8256520	of cool.
8256520	8266760	And, um, also, apparently, uh, Minecraft update 1.8 has been, uh, delayed a little bit, by
8266760	8273760	a week, and 1.8 would add, uh, the Minecraft Adventure mode, and that'll be coming, uh,
8273760	8274760	very soon.
8274760	8281960	Apparently, um, 1.8 is released in the next few months, and they're saying that they're
8281960	8290240	also starting the crunch for the full release, which is gonna be on 11.11.11, so, yeah, neat.
8290240	8295960	And the Adventure mode, I believe, was, like, where you can actually create your own, um,
8295960	8300440	I think, I know that they've added maps recently, but, uh, maybe you can make your own kind
8300440	8302160	of, like, Zelda-type game or something.
8302160	8304880	It should be kind of neat.
8304880	8307120	Definitely adding a lot more stuff to this.
8307120	8312600	At some point, I'll have to check it out, just not yet.
8312600	8313600	All right.
8313600	8314600	Uh, DDR News.
8314600	8319440	Uh, Dar Toagak wants to know, before I get to DDR News, does Loki have Minecraft, question
8319440	8320440	mark.
8320440	8321440	That's from our chatroom.
8321440	8324280	Um, I have it on my iPod, actually.
8324280	8325280	Oh, that's interesting.
8325280	8330280	Uh, cause, you know, that one, uh, Minecraft app or whatever that came out and they got
8330280	8333600	pulled immediately, yeah, I found it.
8333600	8339320	So, um, I have that, but I haven't really, I mean, trying to use it on iPods is just,
8339320	8340320	it's retarded.
8340320	8342080	Um, no, I haven't really played it yet.
8342080	8345800	I had, I thought I had downloaded it at one point, but I, I guess not.
8345800	8352760	All right, um, moving on to, uh, DDR, and this is about a new arcade release.
8352760	8358000	It's Dance Dance Revolution X3, uh, Konami is moving on with the DDR series, which I'm
8358000	8363400	just kind of like shaking my head at, but, um, I don't know, I do find this kind of interesting.
8363400	8369080	The full title of the game is going to be Dance Dance Revolution X3 versus Dance Dance
8369080	8371360	Revolution Second Mix.
8371360	8376560	There will be a second mix mode in the game where you can play the full version of Dance
8376560	8382320	Dance Revolution Second Mix, including all the licensed music that appeared in that game.
8382320	8384740	Would that include Strictly Business?
8384740	8385740	Because that song-
8385740	8386740	That would be great.
8386740	8388120	I don't think that is possible.
8388120	8391800	I think Strictly, it's got to come from the version where Strictly Business got taken
8391800	8395800	out and a different song got put in, but anyway, we're digressing into too much DDR nerddom.
8395800	8400080	Uh, but anyhow, there, they will be introducing new features into the Second Mix game, including
8400080	8402040	eAmusement capability.
8402040	8405960	Of course, X3 is really the highlight, and that's the game they want you to play.
8405960	8411800	Four hundred and eighty tracks in total, uh, standard DDR music, uh, mix songs, uh, let's
8411800	8416840	see, uh, variety of Bimani artists, transplant songs from other Bimani series, eAmusement
8416840	8421240	Gate, a community-oriented website for Konami games that allows players to form groups,
8421240	8423200	share scores, and interact with other players.
8423200	8427320	That actually sounds kind of cool, um, will it make an arcade here?
8427320	8428320	I don't know.
8428320	8430080	Could it get a home release that good?
8430080	8431080	Doubt it.
8431080	8432080	See, that's the-
8432080	8433080	That's the-
8433080	8434080	Why can't I get that as a home release?
8434080	8438640	See, this is what pisses us off so much, is like, they put all this effort into DDR for
8438640	8444400	the arcade, which, you know, we would love to believe that the arcade is still, you know,
8444400	8452320	a viable place to have these type of games, but at the same time, they can't just strictly
8452320	8454960	port this to the home console.
8454960	8460440	Whatever happened with the problem being, you know, back in the PlayStation 1 days,
8460440	8464080	just take the arcade release, you put it- bring it home, and you add a couple things.
8464080	8465080	Done.
8465080	8466080	That's it.
8466080	8467080	People loved it.
8467080	8468760	Now you gotta change it up now.
8468760	8471080	I don't understand the point.
8471080	8477800	Oh, it's because probably licensing 480 songs for home would be a little bit expensive,
8477800	8478800	I guess.
8478800	8480800	I don't know.
8480800	8481800	Alright.
8481800	8486640	Well, I'm- I'm curious about this whole, like, second- I mean, second mix, just to put it
8486640	8490240	in perspective for those that haven't followed DDR like we have, it's like 11 years old.
8490240	8491720	What- the game came out in 99, right?
8491720	8494240	That was the first one I owned, was second mix on Dreamcast.
8494240	8497200	Yeah, so it's weird that they're kind of going back to that.
8497200	8501080	I mean, dude, I wonder if second mix will have- what was that fucking mode that's only
8501080	8502080	in second mix, Jamie?
8502080	8503080	It was like your favorite fucking mode?
8503080	8504080	Oh shit.
8504080	8505080	Unison?
8505080	8506080	Dance battle.
8506080	8507080	Dance battle.
8507080	8508080	Maybe that'll come back.
8508080	8509080	Yeah.
8509080	8510080	That would actually be kind of rad.
8510080	8511080	Dance battle was awesome.
8511080	8512080	Dance battle's the one where you would have a measure where you could just make up your
8512080	8514280	own steps, and then the other player had to do them.
8514280	8515280	Yeah.
8515280	8518560	So you could just- You could only have like two- two things at any beat at a time.
8518560	8522920	Yeah, I mean, you couldn't go too shit crazy, but they would have to do whatever you just
8522920	8523920	did.
8523920	8526760	I mean, we used to just try to fuck each other's day.
8526760	8530560	And also, on top of that, there was no Vivid.
8530560	8532040	It was all flat.
8532040	8533040	Ooh.
8533040	8537120	We didn't have any of them speed modifiers either.
8537120	8542240	We didn't have any of them fancy full video backgrounds neither either.
8542240	8547480	I mean, this was at third Korean where you could switch it into second mix.
8547480	8548960	Yes.
8548960	8552880	Or SSR mode in second mix on the Dreamcast one.
8552880	8553880	Oh yeah.
8553880	8554880	Yeah.
8554880	8555880	You know what SSR was, people?
8555880	8559720	Those were all the nine footers.
8559720	8563040	I'm really curious to see how this translates in the arcades, but we'll see.
8563040	8565040	They'll fuck it up somehow.
8565040	8566040	Prove me wrong, Konami.
8566040	8567040	I dare you.
8567040	8570920	You should play Strictly Businesses, our transfer music, after birth.
8570920	8571920	Remind me after the show.
8571920	8572920	All right.
8572920	8573920	Moving on.
8573920	8574920	Ah.
8574920	8575920	Dark Sakura, right?
8575920	8576920	Oh, yes.
8576920	8577920	Sorry.
8577920	8579600	Stop playing on Facebook.
8579600	8580600	We're trying to do a show.
8580600	8581600	Nah.
8581600	8583840	By the way, can I say something that's pissing me off about Facebook?
8583840	8584840	What?
8584840	8587160	I'm still not in the Civ world beta.
8587160	8588160	That pisses me off.
8588160	8589160	Just saying.
8589160	8590160	Sorry, Rob.
8590160	8591160	I'm mad.
8591160	8592160	Don't be mad.
8592160	8593160	Get even.
8593160	8594160	So, guess what?
8594160	8605160	Kazuo Hirai is now the chairman of Sony SEI.
8605160	8610400	Yeah, he's now the head doodoo in charge.
8610400	8614600	And guess who is replacing him as group CEO?
8614600	8616320	That would be Andrew House.
8616320	8617320	He's taking over.
8617320	8622800	But guess what's happening to Ken Kutaragi, the crayon eater and helmet wearer.
8622800	8627800	He's retiring for reals, except he's going to hang around as senior technology advisor.
8627800	8631800	He's going to a very special home where they serve crayons for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
8631800	8640300	He's going to be eating the rest of his dinner through straws for the rest of his life, because
8640300	8643920	they don't give you food that you can hurt yourself with in the home.
8643920	8647880	He's going to be eating some gurber.
8647880	8648880	No.
8648880	8656720	But yeah, he actually did retire, but he's remaining behind as senior technology advisor.
8656720	8663920	And yeah, it seems like a really crappy time to do, like, oh, you just had the most insecure
8663920	8665480	system ever, blah, blah, blah.
8665480	8666880	Oh, here's a promotion.
8666880	8671760	But really, the fact is that Akira Sato retired.
8671760	8677640	So that's why they're shoving people up.
8677640	8680520	We knew there was going to be a management shakeup coming, though, after everything that
8680520	8681520	they went through the past few months.
8681520	8684000	But I thought it would be deserved firings.
8684000	8687000	Sackings.
8687000	8690200	I like the word sacking a little more.
8690200	8691200	The people have been sacked.
8691200	8692800	I would like them to be rendered redundant.
8692800	8694640	All right, moving on.
8694640	8697520	Loki, what do you got for us?
8697520	8698720	We were talking...
8698720	8700760	You're watching the Giggling Girls video, aren't you?
8700760	8701760	Yes, I am.
8701760	8702760	It looks like it's...
8702760	8703760	Oh my god, it's so awesome!
8703760	8706400	Oh my god, it's GLaDOS, oh my god!
8706400	8709920	And now for two Giggling Schoolgirls.
8709920	8712560	By the way, that is the third podcast that OLR is working on.
8712560	8714120	It's Giggling Girls playing video games.
8714120	8715120	I'm just kidding.
8715120	8718040	Wouldn't that be the Giggling Lesbian Show?
8718040	8720560	I wish, if they still lived here.
8720560	8721560	Anyways.
8721560	8732600	The PSP remaster titles that were announced during both E3 and at their own events, they're
8732600	8738280	basically able to do this because of the help of a PSP engine, a software development kit
8738280	8745720	that Sony put out regarding these PSP remaster titles that allows them to be able to port
8745720	8747720	them into HD.
8747720	8754640	And with high-resolution rendering, stereoscopic 3D, and wireless controller support for Dual
8754640	8755640	Shock 3.
8755640	8760540	And apparently, they haven't announced any more remaster titles other than Monster Hunter
8760540	8766000	Portable III, and then also, of course, there's, I mean, they call it the remaster title, but
8766000	8772760	the God of War Origins collection, which is coming out, that's basically the two PSP God
8772760	8776360	of War games.
8776360	8780120	But yeah, it looks like we're going to see a lot more of these, because they've run out
8780120	8782120	of ideas.
8782120	8783760	Funny!
8783760	8787320	Sorry, I'm slow.
8787320	8790360	I'm chatting with listeners about Final Fantasy XIII.
8790360	8794640	We're talking about what parties we use, and they're telling me that, somebody, who's telling
8794640	8800000	me that they use, Dungeon Buster is saying, I think it's lightning saws and vanilla, I'm
8800000	8801000	like, who do you have as a sentinel?
8801000	8802440	Because you don't have a sentinel in that party.
8802440	8806040	Like, you have to have Fang or Snow, and I don't use Snow because he's a whiny vagina,
8806040	8809680	but I like Fang, because she's hardcore, so I use her as my sentinel.
8809680	8810680	Anyway.
8810680	8814040	Oh yeah, PSP remasters, cool, cool deal.
8814040	8815840	Any of those worth getting, you think?
8815840	8823280	Um, I didn't really play Monster Hunter, and God of War, I don't know, God of War would
8823280	8825180	be fun to play, I guess.
8825180	8829760	I haven't really played in, I only think I went through all the way in two.
8829760	8836120	I know I didn't play all the way through in one because my, it glitched out of me in one,
8836120	8841120	the very last boss.
8841120	8849520	Going on to anticipated games, Gears of War 3 has leaked to the internet already, uh oh,
8849520	8854200	this is a, not a finalized build by the way, but it does have the full campaign and there
8854200	8856060	are some multiplayer modes.
8856060	8859800	This could be the E3 build of the game, but not sure.
8859800	8863880	They say it's a developer build, or what they call, oh and you've heard this term on the
8863880	8866420	show before, a JTAG version of the game.
8866420	8869880	You may need a special modified Xbox 360 or dev kit to run it.
8869880	8870880	It's a developer.
8870880	8875680	But Loki would never indulge in that, because that would be wrong to download that and play
8875680	8876680	that.
8876680	8882720	Yes, that would be wrong, and it's a developer version of the game, because JTAGs basically
8882720	8886240	can operate like a developer's console.
8886240	8889720	I have a dev kit too, so that'd be.
8889720	8894920	So if you're trying to keep yourself spoiler free on Gears of War 3 stories, you might
8894920	8895920	want to leave the internet.
8895920	8899620	Yeah, you might want to take a break from the internet for about six months, or whenever
8899620	8901280	this game is supposed to come out.
8901280	8902800	Uh, yeah, careful.
8902800	8909760	Because they do have, I mean they have a bunch of different, I guess, builds in here.
8909760	8914800	Uh, they have like a testing, shipping, release, and then multiplayer.
8914800	8918920	So they're testing a bunch of different things.
8918920	8920960	By the way, I love having a podcast.
8920960	8921960	Can I just say that?
8921960	8922960	I love this.
8922960	8925720	Like, you know, I was just bitching a minute ago that I'm not playing Civ World, and one
8925720	8928560	listener just said, oh, there's an invite in your inbox now.
8928560	8929560	Awwww.
8929560	8931560	Love the internet.
8931560	8933160	Love it.
8933160	8934160	I love it.
8934160	8935680	I wish Google Plus had been that easy.
8935680	8939120	If I didn't invite you, like, during that 90 minute window that one night, you got screwed.
8939120	8940320	I didn't get my invite.
8940320	8941840	I know, because they shut it off.
8941840	8944400	Like, I cannot invite people now to Google Plus.
8944400	8946000	Fucking retarded.
8946000	8948080	It'll be, it'll be opened up soon.
8948080	8949080	For others.
8949080	8950080	We'll see.
8950080	8952760	Uh, there's not a lot on there right now.
8952760	8955860	It's just, you know, yay, I'm on Google Plus and it's not Facebook.
8955860	8958520	Like that's what every status update I see on there is right now.
8958520	8961160	Hey, it's not Facebook.
8961160	8966200	Also it's not Facebook, but is ten times more awesome is our mailbag.
8966200	8968620	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
8968620	8972520	Every week DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and dives in and reads some emails.
8972520	8976280	She's gonna share them with you right now if she can stop playing on Tumblr.
8976280	8979360	I'm putting something important to other artists on there.
8979360	8982040	Well, I will tell you what it is, because it's actually pretty cool.
8982040	8990240	The iCloud logo is actually using the golden ratio, um, as its design background, so anyway.
8990240	8991240	Nyeh.
8991240	8992240	It's important.
8992240	8993240	See?
8993240	8994240	People like circles.
8994240	8995240	Okay.
8995240	9000800	This one is from Robbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb, it's called Implications of Brown vs. EMA Ruling.
9000800	9002480	You'll talk the subject to death this week.
9002480	9006760	I find whenever I try to explain this to a non-gamer, they not only don't care, but they
9006760	9008880	think it doesn't affect them.
9008880	9012720	Every time they play Solitaire, Farmville, Bejeweled, take an online test, give games
9012720	9017080	to their kids, or anything else software related, they're doing so without fear of breaking
9017080	9019240	a bunch of state-by-state laws.
9019240	9023640	Soon we won't do anything without some sort of interactive media, be it a question or
9023640	9024640	a controller.
9024640	9026240	It affects everyone in the USA.
9026240	9030200	My two bits without repeating a story, Robbbbbbbbbbbb.
9030200	9033920	I've given him some more bubbas.
9033920	9035000	And okay.
9035000	9040680	There is, uh, a couple, actually one from Game Politics, another story that he linked,
9040680	9044120	about Star Wars Galaxies players filing a class action lawsuit.
9044120	9045400	Wow, really?
9045400	9049480	I want to know more about that, actually, because the game is shutting down soon, right?
9049480	9050480	Yeah.
9050480	9051480	So they're filing class action lawsuits?
9051480	9052480	Why?
9052480	9055880	It's one of the lifetime subscriptions, isn't it?
9055880	9060880	So basically it says that more than 50 Star Wars Galaxies players are filing a class action
9060880	9067960	lawsuit against Sony, and there are a bunch of other players that says that they will
9067960	9074600	do the same thing, um, because Sony is shutting down, they basically are having, you know,
9074600	9078680	their petitions go up, but the problem is that they agreed that Sony could cancel the
9078680	9080520	game at any time.
9080520	9083800	So uh, they're SOL.
9083800	9088120	I'm pretty sure that's in the terms of service for any MMO, even Warcraft.
9088120	9089800	They can pull the plug at any time.
9089800	9091840	Remember Warcraft shut down in China for four months?
9091840	9092840	That could happen here.
9092840	9093840	Yeah.
9093840	9094840	It won't, but it could.
9094840	9103720	Well, also, um, about the whole Resident Evil mercenaries, basically, um, Amazon customers
9103720	9110040	are actually putting like huge, huge negative reviews on Amazon.
9110040	9114640	Like there is one person saying, I don't care how much fun this game is or how good it looks
9114640	9116200	or how much it costs.
9116200	9117760	There's one save slot.
9117760	9119840	Save data is permanent and cannot be deleted.
9119840	9124040	Capcom is attempting to set a new precedent and consumer manipulation and control with
9124040	9127280	this product.
9127280	9131360	Yes.
9131360	9137880	And then, um, dear Sakura, Loki and Roger.
9137880	9141960	Roar, this is Roger Roberts.
9141960	9148520	This, this week a game company did slash said slash didn't do slash didn't say something.
9148520	9151400	This thing is the worst thing in the history of the world and ever.
9151400	9152400	That's bad.
9152400	9153400	Roar.
9153400	9154400	112.
9154400	9157060	Stay black for entertainment.
9157060	9160920	This message has been brought to you by corn corn, great addition to tacos, bad addition
9160920	9161920	to Silent Hill.
9161920	9166480	After all, adding corn to tacos has never caused haze.
9166480	9168880	Not for my iPad.
9168880	9170920	I'm allergic to corn of all kinds.
9170920	9174160	So I'm assuming my name got auto corrected to Roger.
9174160	9176040	No cause Julian called you Roger.
9176040	9178280	Oh, he said happy birthday Roger.
9178280	9179280	That's right.
9179280	9180280	Happy.
9180280	9181280	That's right.
9181280	9182280	I remember now.
9182280	9183280	Shit, I forgot to bring back the cake plate.
9183280	9184280	God damn it.
9184280	9185760	Which by the way, a certain someone is listening right now.
9185760	9186760	Hi.
9186760	9190320	Oh, I hope, I hope the four year old's not listening with all our potty mouth language.
9190320	9195360	Didn't you say you wanted to say something to...
9195360	9196680	I said it on Facebook.
9196680	9197680	Okay.
9197680	9198680	Take care of that.
9198680	9199680	Okay.
9199680	9200680	I didn't know you wanted to say something publicly.
9200680	9201680	Well thank you for the cake.
9201680	9202680	I think I expressed that last week.
9202680	9203680	Sorry.
9203680	9204680	No, no, no.
9204680	9205680	It's fine.
9205680	9206680	Nah.
9206680	9207680	Okay.
9207680	9208680	This is from Chiggers, which that's the worst nickname ever.
9208680	9209680	Okay.
9209680	9210680	I'm sorry.
9210680	9211680	No, I love that nickname.
9211680	9212680	Do you know what, do you know what those are?
9212680	9213680	Uh oh.
9213680	9214680	Is this something really...
9214680	9219040	They're bugs that burrow under your skin and lay their eggs and infect under your skin
9219040	9223320	and then the eggs hatch and they come out of your skin leaving these weird zombie like
9223320	9224480	trails on your arms.
9224480	9226320	I've seen it happen.
9226320	9227320	That's kind of awesome actually.
9227320	9228320	It's really disgusting.
9228320	9232700	Um, dear OLR, long time listener, six years, first time emailer.
9232700	9238540	By the way, hearts, I've noticed PS3 is now starting to put out TurboGrafx-16 games.
9238540	9242680	Do you think it's possible they may try and get some games that were released out on the
9242680	9246280	NES or Saturn from any third party publishers?
9246280	9248920	Keep up the good work and belated happy ninth anniversary.
9248920	9252080	Yours truly in Hoard House, Gildy, Chiggers.
9252080	9255520	I really hope that you didn't name yourself after a bug that lays skin and...
9255520	9257000	I kind of hope you did.
9257000	9261320	Lays eggs in your skin and explodes everywhere into red bloody masses.
9261320	9264360	And Becky says she has no idea why Julian called you Roger.
9264360	9267120	Cause kids get confused sometimes.
9267120	9268120	He was nice.
9268120	9269120	It's cute.
9269120	9270120	Four year olds can get away with it cause it's cute.
9270120	9272120	And then he screamed.
9272120	9280400	Anyhow, as far as the whole PlayStation 3 TurboGrafx-16 games, no, they will not get games on the
9280400	9282320	NES, SNES, or any of that because that talks...
9282320	9283920	Even if they were third party.
9283920	9287800	Even if they were third party because you're emulating the hardware that doesn't belong.
9287800	9290400	And so I think the whole licensing and all that would be...
9290400	9294180	I mean they would have to completely redo the game.
9294180	9295180	Completely redo it.
9295180	9296180	And I just don't see that happening.
9296180	9297180	They're not gonna.
9297180	9298180	Yeah.
9298180	9301500	I mean never say never just like Nintendo, herp-a-derp.
9301500	9306320	It would be hilarious if they did Saturn games on a PlayStation at all.
9306320	9309120	That would just be lol.
9309120	9311960	Cause the big competition was the Saturn and PlayStation back in the day.
9311960	9314960	Or what about PlayStation games on a Dreamcast?
9314960	9318200	That I have three video games that I can play on my Dreamcast.
9318200	9319200	That's the joke.
9319200	9320200	Was it what?
9320200	9321200	It was Tekken and Crazy Taxi.
9321200	9323840	Tekken 3 and Crazy Taxi and Metal Gear.
9323840	9324840	Metal Gear Solid.
9324840	9325840	Was it really?
9325840	9326840	Yes it was.
9326840	9327840	That was all Bleemcast by the way.
9327840	9328840	They were Bleemcast.
9328840	9333880	I remember when I tried to run Bleem on my PC, granted this was way back in the day and
9333880	9335160	that did not work.
9335160	9339760	I remember when I had an emulator that worked better than Bleem.
9339760	9344080	And we were trying to play Street Fighter EX3.
9344080	9347560	That was lolsy cause it still ran like crap.
9347560	9348560	But yeah.
9348560	9351520	Tekken actually did look a lot better on Dreamcast.
9351520	9353040	Just saying.
9353040	9354480	That's it.
9354480	9355480	Email us.
9355480	9357240	Mailbag at OrangelaungeRadio.com.
9357240	9359280	Make Dark Sakura work more next week.
9359280	9360280	Send us more emails.
9360280	9362160	Mailbag at OrangelaungeRadio.com.
9362160	9366960	Meanwhile, we do a segment here every week on the show that sometimes has to do with
9366960	9367960	video games.
9367960	9368960	Sometimes not.
9368960	9369960	Why?
9369960	9370960	Because we can.
9370960	9375960	FUs of the Week!
9375960	9390160	FU to everybody who's eating at Wendy's today, Rob.
9390160	9391160	Haters gonna hate.
9391160	9393000	For not bringing me a Frosty.
9393000	9395600	Cause I wanted a Frosty all day.
9395600	9398160	I didn't get a Frosty, but the berry tea was very good.
9398160	9399160	I'm not gonna lie.
9399160	9401040	I even told my husband to go get me a Frosty.
9401040	9402040	And you know what he did?
9402040	9404160	He went across the street and got a hamburger.
9404160	9406960	And then he brought me one and I just had a hot dog.
9406960	9408680	Oh, from your neighbors that are cooking?
9408680	9409680	Yes.
9409680	9410680	We're doing our barbecue tomorrow.
9410680	9413920	You did tell the neighbors it's July 3rd, right?
9413920	9416680	No one cur.
9416680	9418560	FU to Wendy's for sucking.
9418560	9419560	Hey.
9419560	9421560	Cause they have terrible food.
9421560	9428760	Somebody sent me a coupon for free Frosty since you gave Rob a Civ beta thing.
9428760	9431760	One of them is game related, the other is not.
9431760	9432760	Don't care.
9432760	9433760	I want a Frosty.
9433760	9434760	Frosty's the best thing ever.
9434760	9438000	Do you know what Miek Latov tried to convince me was a good idea once?
9438000	9439480	Dipping your french fries into your Frosty?
9439480	9441960	No, dipping chicken McNuggets into Frosty.
9441960	9442960	Gross.
9442960	9443960	The Wendy's don't have McNuggets.
9443960	9444960	There's people that love that.
9444960	9445960	You know what I mean?
9445960	9446960	Like chocolate shakes.
9446960	9447960	And Rob?
9447960	9448960	What?
9448960	9449960	It's gross.
9449960	9454400	I was gonna say Miek Latov, hey, I don't know if he's still working, no you don't still
9454400	9455400	work in Gamestop.
9455400	9457800	No, he definitely does not work in Gamestop.
9457800	9464520	I need the DLC for Earth Defense Force, I need to pick up that pre-order shit somewhere.
9464520	9465520	Ask the listeners.
9465520	9468640	Someone sent me the DLC for Earth Defense Force.
9468640	9469880	And you will give them?
9469880	9470880	Nothing.
9470880	9471880	A high-five.
9471880	9472880	A handshake.
9472880	9473880	Can't even do that.
9473880	9484360	Alright, my F.U. of the week goes to, this is a work-related F.U. because I don't want
9484360	9486520	people thinking it has to do with other things.
9486520	9487520	It's work-related.
9487520	9491160	F.U. to surprises.
9491160	9492160	Work-related surprises.
9492160	9495480	Alright, that's really it.
9495480	9498000	Otherwise things are actually pretty good.
9498000	9499000	Let's move on.
9499000	9500000	Yeah.
9500000	9507360	So, this is kind of neat, I mean, unexpected, I guess, because life goes on, I guess.
9507360	9511800	But, Tokyo Game Show's gonna have a pretty good showing this year.
9511800	9518200	They're up to 146 exhibitors over the 138 in 2010, and of course people are like, ah,
9518200	9523120	you know, earthquake, and old developers, ah, they, you know, suffered from it.
9523120	9529480	I mean, it's been, it's gonna be a while, and you know what, life does go on, you know,
9529480	9534880	so it's gonna be up, they're expecting to see, I guess, or they're gonna try to reduce
9534880	9538200	the power usage during the show.
9538200	9545520	They're gonna drop it down 25% versus 2010 as well, and, but overall it's gonna have
9545520	9547960	a really good showing.
9547960	9552320	So it's pretty cool.
9552320	9556540	That's great that it seems like it's gonna be such a big, big show, and just, it's great
9556540	9559800	that they're kind of bouncing with all that recovery stuff, so I'm very happy to hear
9559800	9561360	it, actually.
9561360	9564120	So there you go.
9564120	9570000	Moving on to one last story here about music, music-related stuff.
9570000	9573680	First off, if you didn't already know about this, I imagine most of you listeners already
9573680	9578320	have downloaded this and put them on their iPods, but if you are the one that has not,
9578320	9585160	more Portal 2 free music is now available, volume 2 of the Songs to Test by, 18 new tracks,
9585160	9588280	14 ringtones for your iPhone and Android devices.
9588280	9590280	I had no idea that there were ringtones in there.
9590280	9592680	I need to look more carefully at this stuff.
9592680	9593680	You can check that out.
9593680	9599360	New songs include Bring Your Daughter to Work Day, I Am Not a Moron, and Potatoes Lament.
9599360	9600620	Which is actually really cool.
9600620	9604040	You can also have the orange or blue Portal sound as your messaging ringtone.
9604040	9605040	So like, I would love...
9605040	9606040	Unless you have an iPhone.
9606040	9607040	Don't you wanna have your...
9607040	9608040	Oh, really?
9608040	9609040	It doesn't work on iPhone?
9609040	9610480	Because you can't change your iPhone sounds for your messages.
9610480	9611480	That's why I didn't notice it.
9611480	9612480	Yes, you can.
9612480	9613480	You can.
9613480	9614480	For messages?
9614480	9615480	For messages?
9615480	9617760	Only for the ones that they put on your phone.
9617760	9618760	Oh, yeah.
9618760	9620760	Yeah, that's true.
9620760	9621760	Yeah.
9621760	9625520	Volume 3 is coming soon.
9625520	9626520	How soon?
9626520	9628880	I said soon.
9628880	9633320	Also in music-related news, another Rockman Arrange album, of course you know that, here's
9633320	9642480	Mega Man, Rockman Unity announced a new Rockman Arrange soundtrack.
9642480	9646440	We Are Rockman is the...Rockman, excuse me, is the podcast.
9646440	9654680	It includes Mashihiro Aoki on guitar, Yasumasa Kitagawa on bass.
9654680	9657520	He did work on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom All-Stars.
9657520	9664920	Mitsuhiko Bleep Bleep Boop Bloop Maestro Takano on drums, and there will be some guest musicians
9664920	9665920	as well.
9665920	9669400	Otherwise, we don't have a lot of details about the album, but basically Capcom's greats
9669400	9672360	are getting together to do some Rockman Arrange music.
9672360	9673360	Gotta be cool.
9673360	9676280	That kind of sounds like what the Black Mages did for Final Fantasy.
9676280	9677960	That's kind of what that sounds like to me.
9677960	9679760	So there you go.
9679760	9682160	Alright, that does it for gaming news tonight.
9682160	9683280	We're done.
9683280	9684280	We're out of here.
9684280	9686720	But not until we open up the Skype line and take some calls.
9686720	9689440	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.
9689440	9691800	Give us a call and you can talk with us.
9691800	9694680	We can talk about any of the stories we talked about tonight, or maybe we missed something
9694680	9696280	that you wanted to talk about.
9696280	9700240	Do you want to talk about Nintendo and the localization, or maybe you want to talk more
9700240	9704160	about, I don't know, Minecraft or Gears of War 3 leaking, whatever you want to talk about,
9704160	9705160	give us a call.
9705160	9709400	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.
9709400	9712800	In the meantime, you know I'm going to ask Loki if there's any last minute stories.
9712800	9718480	So apparently, because to celebrate Independence Day, you can now dress up your avatar on Xbox
9718480	9720760	360 as a Confederate soldier.
9720760	9721760	Awesome.
9721760	9723760	Oh boy.
9723760	9726440	Go south.
9726440	9730160	I don't know, that's kind of weird.
9730160	9734440	Not at all a bad thing.
9734440	9739760	What do you mean that they, oh, but ok, it's just like you do the right combination of
9739760	9740760	hats and gear.
9740760	9744440	No, they have Civil War uniform, 160 Microsoft points.
9744440	9745440	Really?
9745440	9746440	Interesting.
9746440	9749480	I mean, but you could do also, you know, the other stuff.
9749480	9756000	They have also, you know, some funny hats, because everyone loves funny hats.
9756000	9757400	I love funny hats.
9757400	9762960	It'd just be weird though, like, since a lot of that DLC doesn't translate over though
9762960	9767640	into games, it would still be funny like playing, you know, seeing it or something like that
9767640	9771680	with a civil, you know, a Confederate soldier or something.
9771680	9774120	Anything else in last minute news tonight?
9774120	9775120	Uhhhhh.
9775120	9779680	Earth Defense Force is awesome.
9779680	9781960	I actually watched you playing that a little bit over there.
9781960	9783240	It's really hard.
9783240	9786160	It seriously, and I'm only playing it easy.
9786160	9791160	Apparently if you play the harder difficulties, you can turn your AI bots off.
9791160	9792480	I don't even want to know.
9792480	9796760	It's just, and then once you beat the game, they also have campaign remix where you can
9796760	9799800	play with different enemies spawning.
9799800	9802080	So it's got a lot of gameplay built in there.
9802080	9807040	I'm sorry if I'm just ranting about this game, but it's just, it's worth picking up.
9807040	9809640	You are a little bit, but it's fine.
9809640	9810640	We all knew this would happen.
9810640	9812680	You've been talking about this game for like a year.
9812680	9813680	Exactly.
9813680	9815400	Just you wait until Saints Row 3 comes out.
9815400	9819320	I mean, you think this is bad, oh no, not even close.
9819320	9822400	I actually kind of want to be there when you're playing Saints Row 3 for the first time.
9822400	9823400	It is gonna be just...
9823400	9827280	Like, I don't know how I can do that, but I need, we need to have a Saints Row 3 party.
9827280	9828520	It's gonna be fucking nuts.
9828520	9830280	Okay, so here's something we can talk about.
9830280	9833480	You can stream it on the internet except, oh shit, we would be breaking the law.
9833480	9836960	1877 Game O.L.R., username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio if you want to give us a call.
9836960	9839200	Bunchy Aerospace was finally announced what that is.
9839200	9843400	It's a partnership program with social and mobile devs where they're basically gonna
9843400	9853260	help either publish, promote, or, you know, draw interest for different games that are
9853260	9856960	coming out on these platforms where they may not get as much interest.
9856960	9858280	So that's kind of cool.
9858280	9864040	Unfortunately, they will not be building spaceships as not part of the aerospace program.
9864040	9865040	Let's go to the phones.
9865040	9866040	We have a call.
9866040	9867040	1877 Game O.L.R.
9867040	9868040	after this is done.
9868040	9869040	Hi, OrangeLawnsRadio.
9869040	9870040	Who's this?
9870040	9871040	Hi.
9871040	9872040	Pleasure, Zaku here.
9872040	9873040	Hi, Zaku.
9873040	9876480	I'm just trying to recover before tomorrow and everything.
9876480	9878680	Well tomorrow is when the real parties are supposed to happen.
9878680	9879680	What not?
9879680	9880680	What?
9880680	9882680	Tomorrow is when the real parties are supposed to happen.
9882680	9884080	I don't know.
9884080	9886160	Just like a barbecue at my place at home.
9886160	9887160	Oh, okay.
9887160	9890320	That and trying to go out with this girl tomorrow.
9890320	9891320	Well I hope he gets some.
9891320	9892320	What's on your mind tonight?
9892320	9893880	Uh, nothing much.
9893880	9901920	Just like trying to lament over the fallout of, you know, what transpired last week with
9901920	9907800	the whole Supreme Court decision, which I know you probably covered in great detail
9907800	9909160	before this call.
9909160	9911700	We did, but what are your thoughts?
9911700	9912700	I don't know.
9912700	9917640	On one hand, it's like they're grasping at straws and trying to legislate something that's
9917640	9921720	already been declared protected speech for all intents and purposes.
9921720	9928600	So it's like the people who were, you know, the ones who pushed the, you know, the particular
9928600	9933480	person that pushed the law and, you know, and actually got the law, you know, introduced
9933480	9939920	the law and got it passed, well he's, he's, he's basically not giving up in that sense.
9939920	9945120	He thinks he can wrangle his way through the constitution when it's pretty clear, even,
9945120	9948920	you know, it's pretty clear that, you know, when you ban something like this, that's no
9948920	9952960	matter, no matter if you put lipstick on, on that same bill, it's still going to be
9952960	9956160	unconstitutional because they've already...
9956160	9962080	Well, but what about how there were a couple justices that basically said, you can regulate
9962080	9963480	games just not like this.
9963480	9966720	That's maybe leaving the door wide open for somebody else.
9966720	9972240	I know it's, some have said it's a 5-4 split in reality because two of them concurred with
9972240	9976480	the, you know, two of the other justices concurred with Scalia.
9976480	9977480	Right.
9977480	9978480	Yeah.
9978480	9982400	So it's basically, it's like they weren't, they weren't for it, but at the same time
9982400	9983920	they were in between.
9983920	9990960	So it wasn't like, you know, if you really get, if you really go deep into that decision,
9990960	9996200	there's not that much, there's only like a, you know, a thin, you know, a thin margin
9996200	9999600	of just prevail, of prevailing opinion.
9999600	10000600	What do you think about this?
10000600	10003800	Something that's just like, that it barely got through.
10003800	10006900	Let me quickly ask you, what'd you think about this other bill we spent some time talking
10006900	10011640	about tonight, the whole, you know, no more streaming of movies and games and so forth?
10011640	10016960	Oh, that one is, that one right there, that's a landmine.
10016960	10022080	I'm pretty sure if it ever comes to court, it's going to, one way or another will know
10022080	10024080	what impact it has.
10024080	10026680	Right now it's very murky.
10026680	10029680	And you're just waiting, and they're just waiting, you know, the feds are just waiting
10029680	10031400	to at least use it on something.
10031400	10036400	I can't wait for the 12 year old- Some guy just like leaking a trailer on YouTube
10036400	10040040	or just posting up a gameplay, gameplay footage.
10040040	10046360	And for some reason, you know, some, some video game company, which doesn't, you know,
10046360	10049560	which took offense to that whole act, will stick the feds on him.
10049560	10050560	Think about it.
10050560	10055160	I can't wait for the 10 year old to get sued for posting a YouTube of her singing-
10055160	10056160	That's the thing, it's not even sued.
10056160	10059600	He's actually, you're going to see federal agents roll up in his house.
10059600	10065600	Singing Lady Gaga's Born This Way, when Lady Gaga herself loves that shit and posts about
10065600	10066600	it to Twitter.
10066600	10070600	There's some 10 year old girl that she invited on stage with her because she loved watching
10070600	10071880	her YouTube performance.
10071880	10075520	I understand, but guess who owns, still has control of the music.
10075520	10081200	No, I get it, but I mean if I- The label, remember, Lady Gaga's only one person that
10081200	10086520	until she's met the, until she's already honored the contract with her label, she doesn't own
10086520	10088000	her music.
10088000	10090760	She's a slave, just like Prince was, hence the symbol.
10090760	10091760	Exactly.
10091760	10094920	And that's the thing, unless you own your master tracks and you can take them anywhere
10094920	10101680	else, then you have control of it, otherwise you've already sold your soul to the label
10101680	10105360	and they'll be the ones taking the feds on that 10 year old kid.
10105360	10108640	All right, any other quick thoughts before we let you go and get another call?
10108640	10116120	Yeah, take advantage of these sales right now on the sites of Amazon, Steam in particular.
10116120	10118920	Lot of really good stuff to be had right now.
10118920	10122560	Great FYI in chat from William Murderface, always love that name.
10122560	10126600	Oh, if anyone's looking for a Diablo 2 fix and does not have Torchlight, it's on sale
10126600	10128400	for $2.99 on Steam today.
10128400	10131520	That's a $3 game, I'm thinking about it right now.
10131520	10137120	If you even remotely like Diablo or Diablo 2, you will get $3 worth out of Torchlight.
10137120	10144560	But I played that game years ago, all I remember is just mashing my mouse, just click mashing.
10144560	10149640	It's very much a dungeon, well here's the great thing, do you have a 360?
10149640	10152160	Yes, but I- Go download the demo.
10152160	10155960	I want to just do it from my end, I want to keep it old school.
10155960	10157880	We can at least download the demo to see what the game's like, all right.
10157880	10160840	I gotta let you go to get more calls, take care buddy.
10160840	10164680	I think Torchlight's a great deal, but yeah, it's a dungeon crawler, so I don't know if
10164680	10169040	you aren't into the dungeon crawlers, you may not like it, but we'll see.
10169040	10170920	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10170920	10173040	Hey, it's Ronmo, what's up everyone?
10173040	10175360	Not much, you know, just hanging.
10175360	10179800	Chilling, smoking a little, you know- Doing a show.
10179800	10182000	Smoking a J, no I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding, we don't do that.
10182000	10185320	Oh, pass it over this way, man, it's the fourth.
10185320	10190400	What's on your mind- Yes, I can think of no better way on spending Independence Day than
10190400	10197520	burning various things, including fireworks, our money, and a J.
10197520	10200920	I'm not gonna complain, so it works for me.
10200920	10204360	Only in America will we celebrate fire, what's on your mind?
10204360	10209240	I have this one question, I've been meaning to ask you guys this for long, so I keep forgetting.
10209240	10210240	The answer is no.
10210240	10213240	God damn it, Ron!
10213240	10214880	What's the question, I'm kidding.
10214880	10221360	Okay, now back at E3, Konami had announced that they were re-releasing, I believe, Zoner
10221360	10226360	the Enders and Silent Hill as the collectors of all the games together?
10226360	10227360	Correct.
10227360	10228360	Yes.
10228360	10233600	Now we had a discussion about that on Twitter, half of us are saying that Konami pretty much
10233600	10237480	turned their back on the fans, they're just looking for a quick pop.
10237480	10242960	The other half are saying Konami is doing this to garner interest into the series to
10242960	10246080	see if it's worth another game.
10246080	10248680	What do you think?
10248680	10251000	I think it's a little bit of both, to be honest.
10251000	10256480	I think it's, you know, why not make a little more cash on games that were previously out,
10256480	10259960	although they are having to re-do them and so forth, you know, they're having to change
10259960	10267360	it up a little bit, but if the game sold phenomenally, they would really have no choice but to continue
10267360	10268840	the series, you know what I mean?
10268840	10274000	Like the Metal Gear selection will sell well no matter what, but, you know, Silent Hill
10274000	10277560	1 will probably sell alright, although it's really weird that 1 is not involved, but I
10277560	10280960	guess it has to do with all the voice acting, I don't know.
10280960	10286520	But yeah, you know, I think the games will sell alright, and as far as Konami's motivation,
10286520	10291080	I mean, it's hard to say because the whole repackaging thing, you can't like say that
10291080	10295140	Konami is the first to do it, so I think they're just jumping on a bandwagon that people have
10295140	10303920	shown they want to be on, God of War has already done it, the Ico games and Shadow of the Colossus,
10303920	10307620	all that stuff is being read out, you know, so the gaming populace has already shown they'll
10307620	10311600	buy it, so you can't really blame Konami for putting it out there.
10311600	10315000	And even stuff that's come out recently, like the Prince of Persia trilogy, the Splinter
10315000	10321360	Cell trilogy is coming out a little bit later, and Tomb Raider, they already did all those
10321360	10322360	as well.
10322360	10325200	Okay, I understand that.
10325200	10330600	Now do you think maybe time could be also a factor in this compared to like, if the
10330600	10335520	games came out within a certain range, and maybe a couple years later they put out the
10335520	10341100	collection compared to maybe waiting like five, six years later for a complete collection?
10341100	10344920	I'm not sure I follow you, these collections are coming out next year, so...
10344920	10350320	I mean like, let's say like, they put out Zoner Yenders 1, 2, and 3 with let's say like
10350320	10357680	in 2000, 2001, 2002, and like in 2005 they put out the collectors of all three together.
10357680	10362620	Now let's say instead of 2005 they wait like till about now to put them all out, they wait
10362620	10363960	like almost ten years.
10363960	10368280	But they're gonna upres them and make them more current, you know.
10368280	10371480	They're redoing them in HD, so I'm okay with it.
10371480	10374480	Let's also be honest, how's this any different from the movie industry?
10374480	10379480	You know, the movie industry does this shit all the time and we eat it up, like how many
10379480	10381500	times did the Star Wars movies come out?
10381500	10386240	And they're coming out again on Blu-ray, and I know tons of people that'll be there right
10386240	10387240	when they come out.
10387240	10390160	Well, I don't mean to interrupt, Rob, that's because George Lucas turned his back on the
10390160	10392560	fans and he's a money-grubbing whore.
10392560	10395920	I know that, but the new Star Wars is really awesome.
10395920	10400600	But what about like, okay, Harry Potter.
10400600	10403900	When those movies come out, they come out on Blu-ray, and then you can get a box set
10403900	10405480	with one through five.
10405480	10408520	And then when six came out, you buy six, oh and then now it's a box set with one through
10408520	10412120	six and maybe some other bonus features, a preview of seven.
10412120	10413240	Oh, now seven's out.
10413240	10416740	Now there's a box set of one through seven and there'll be a preview for eight.
10416740	10420340	And there'll be another box set when eight comes out and it'll have the special features
10420340	10425360	online, Uber, God, Poopy Pop, what?
10425360	10427280	Book seven was the last one.
10427280	10428280	But there was eight movies.
10428280	10430040	I'm talking about the movies.
10430040	10433040	I know, book seven was two movies, but I see your point.
10433040	10435160	I was just trying to be an ass.
10435160	10436160	You're trying to be an ass.
10436160	10437160	Wait, wait, wait, now hold on a second.
10437160	10442280	Is not, is not this new movie the eighth movie coming out?
10442280	10447000	I understand it's two parts, but it is, in the line of movies, the eighth movie.
10447000	10448000	Yeah.
10448000	10449000	Yeah, yes.
10449000	10450000	It is the eighth movie.
10450000	10451000	It is.
10451000	10454480	Watch Warner Brothers release both movies together as movie seven.
10454480	10457040	Just the fuck with you.
10457040	10458040	It's just like Twilight.
10458040	10460040	Aren't they splitting the last one into twos?
10460040	10461040	There's five movies.
10461040	10462040	Yeah.
10462040	10464160	As if it hasn't drug out long enough already.
10464160	10466400	Let's put the last one in the two.
10466400	10471680	DJ Morin, DJ Morpheus in our chat room says, actually Lord of the Rings is the biggest
10471680	10473320	DVD horror.
10473320	10474360	That's yeah.
10474360	10477540	Now Blu-ray horror because the super extended editions, yes.
10477540	10482120	As if that movie wasn't long enough and theatrical re-release bullshit, which I don't give a
10482120	10485480	shit about and I won't go see, I wouldn't mind going to see it.
10485480	10489040	I know, you know, it's, I don't know if I should admit this.
10489040	10491600	I never saw the third movie.
10491600	10494800	I saw, I saw the first two opening day nonetheless.
10494800	10495800	I never saw it.
10495800	10496800	For me.
10496800	10503160	And people are going to go, oh, you're a hater, but the whole point is that I read the books.
10503160	10506280	The movies were good.
10506280	10510160	I'm more interested in the Hobbit coming out because I like the Hobbit better than I liked
10510160	10511160	the other books.
10511160	10512280	I can't believe you read those books.
10512280	10513320	I've tried to read those books.
10513320	10516440	I can't like, I'm like, speak a language I can read.
10516440	10518440	Tolkien was so fucking boring.
10518440	10524400	It's a good story, but my God, we don't need that much description of the grass.
10524400	10526440	Rama, I got to let you go and get more calls.
10526440	10530920	Rob, before I go, I just want to say in response to Twilight, I love that picture you posted
10530920	10532800	on your Tumblr.
10532800	10538840	The one of the stakes on the fence that says in case of sparkly vampires or break off in
10538840	10539840	case of sparkly vampires.
10539840	10540840	Right.
10540840	10543680	And I think I posted it and I put, how about screaming fangirls too?
10543680	10544680	Yes.
10544680	10547760	And before I go, I'm going to say, I dedicate this picture to you that I put on my blog
10547760	10548760	post.
10548760	10550200	I just posted it in the chat.
10550200	10551200	All right.
10551200	10552200	You got it.
10552200	10553200	All right.
10553200	10554200	Later.
10554200	10560000	Sorry for the awkward silence there.
10560000	10562880	I was typing an important message because there's a YouTube I want to find real quick
10562880	10563880	there.
10563880	10564880	So I'm trying to find it there.
10564880	10566600	Let me look at what Rama posted to his Tumblr.
10566600	10567600	Hold on one sec.
10567600	10568600	Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
10568600	10573960	And I'm following the link and let's see.
10573960	10575120	I love that.
10575120	10577920	It's haters going to hate, but it's Frankenfurter from the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
10577920	10580080	You see this dark Sakura?
10580080	10581080	That's awesome.
10581080	10582080	Okay.
10582080	10583160	You need to put that on Tumblr so I can reblog it.
10583160	10584160	It's on Rama's Tumblr.
10584160	10585160	Okay.
10585160	10586160	Then I'll reblog it.
10586160	10587160	If you follow him.
10587160	10588160	What's up with...
10588160	10589160	Now it's Tumblr.
10589160	10592920	There was LiveJournal, which I'm a permanent member of, so I always have to love LiveJournal
10592920	10594360	forever and ever.
10594360	10596080	There's Facebook.
10596080	10598440	There's Myspace back in the day.
10598440	10599440	Friendster shit.
10599440	10600440	Twitter.
10600440	10601440	And now it's fucking Tumblr.
10601440	10602440	I never used Friendster.
10602440	10603440	I never used it.
10603440	10604440	Really?
10604440	10606080	How did you avoid that?
10606080	10607080	It was...
10607080	10610040	I love my LiveJournal so much.
10610040	10611040	That was me.
10611040	10612040	All right.
10612040	10613040	Take one more call real quick and then we're going to wrap up the show.
10613040	10614040	Let's go to our own Orange Pots Radio.
10614040	10615040	Hey, it's Blender.
10615040	10616040	Blender!
10616040	10617520	What's on your mind, buddy?
10617520	10618880	Nothing.
10618880	10623960	You know, I kind of wanted to go back to this whole class action lawsuit that you guys were
10623960	10627100	talking about with these online games.
10627100	10629000	These Star Wars Galaxies?
10629000	10630000	Yeah.
10630000	10631000	Yeah.
10631000	10632000	What's up?
10632000	10637480	I think eventually somebody's going to find a loophole and actually get in on this.
10637480	10638880	I know you guys...
10638880	10641640	A couple of you guys are into Disney and all that.
10641640	10645160	Do you remember the Virtual Magic Kingdom game?
10645160	10646760	I don't know if you ever heard of it.
10646760	10649800	I remember the NES game Adventures in the Magic,
10649800	10651400	oh wait, no, no, no, online.
10651400	10653520	No, no, it was the online MMO.
10653520	10654360	I don't think I ever played it.
10654360	10657420	That they put out for the 50 year anniversary.
10657420	10658920	You know what, I know I'm familiar
10658920	10660240	with some of the Disney MMOs.
10660240	10662800	I know Club Penguin and I know that they're infamous
10662800	10664040	for not letting you type.
10665200	10667840	You can only select from select phrases.
10667840	10670160	Well, no, no, no, well what they did is
10670160	10674440	for the 50 year anniversary, they created an MMO,
10674440	10677640	which was, it was a free walk through Disneyland Park
10677640	10680400	and you can create friends and meet people.
10680400	10682040	And it really messed up some people
10682040	10683360	when they closed that site down.
10683360	10685800	In fact, I got a link.
10685800	10687760	I don't know if it's gonna post, but.
10687760	10690080	Rob, Peter was telling us about that
10690080	10690960	when we were at the park.
10690960	10691920	I don't know, I just.
10691920	10694720	Because I have a pen from it.
10694720	10696960	Oh, that's right, that I do remember.
10696960	10697800	Yeah. Yes, I do.
10697800	10700800	Yeah, I have one of the links that I just picked.
10700800	10702440	It was from joystick.com
10702440	10704480	is when they closed the actual site.
10704480	10707680	And you know, it was really devastating
10707680	10710440	because I was actually on it for like two years.
10710440	10715440	And it just, it killed a lot of kids.
10716320	10719280	There was like 10, 11 year old kids that could,
10719280	10722680	or even younger that couldn't play this game anymore.
10722680	10726080	And I really think that somebody's gonna find a loophole
10726080	10728960	with closing down these large MMOs
10728960	10731360	that they're gonna, you know,
10731360	10733960	find a psychological way to get out of this.
10733960	10736120	They can always, it's weird though
10736120	10739000	that a company should be like locked into doing it.
10739000	10740800	You know, like, I'm not sure I agree with that,
10740800	10743400	but I think the nice thing, quote unquote, to do,
10743400	10746160	if you're gonna pull support for your game altogether
10746160	10748360	is to go the Phantasy Star route.
10748360	10750080	And when they closed up Blue Burst,
10750080	10753720	they just said, here, open up your own damn servers.
10753720	10755120	And if you wanna copy your characters over,
10755120	10756240	here's how you do it.
10756240	10757360	Like, isn't that right?
10757360	10758800	Dark Soccer, you followed this better than I did,
10758800	10760520	but Blue Burst, when they went under,
10760520	10761760	Sega was very much like-
10761760	10764760	Sega was like, here's your character data
10764760	10767280	and you can transfer it to the server of your choice.
10767280	10769880	Yeah, but you're in an interesting position
10769880	10774480	with Star Wars Galaxies because they probably just don't,
10774480	10777320	they want those people playing the BioWare Star Wars game
10777320	10778240	that's coming out.
10779200	10780960	They don't want them on the old game.
10780960	10784120	They don't wanna split the fan base like EverQuest did.
10784120	10786760	A lot of people look at what EverQuest did
10786760	10789880	and say, oh boy, that was a mistake.
10789880	10791720	They should have never put out EverQuest 2
10791720	10794320	because people were still tied to EverQuest 1
10794320	10795160	and didn't wanna play it
10795160	10796560	and then it split their fan base.
10796560	10799480	That's why there will never be a World of Warcraft 2.
10799480	10802920	There will never be a World of Warcraft 2.
10802920	10805440	The closest thing you get are these expansions
10805440	10810080	such as Cataclysm that changed Warcraft so drastically,
10810080	10811560	it's almost like a sequel.
10811560	10816560	So the way you're talking about it is breaking it up
10816880	10821480	instead of like, for example, Virtual Magic Kingdom
10821480	10824480	where they closed it down totally.
10824480	10825840	They should have gone open source
10825840	10828280	so somebody who loved it could have kept it going
10828280	10830920	but how can you force a company to do that?
10832080	10832920	Yeah.
10832920	10833760	You can't.
10833760	10836600	And it's so funny because we were,
10836600	10838120	I had a bunch of friends on there
10838120	10841680	and we were on there for, oh, we'd go on there every day.
10841680	10846680	And the thing was, the kids that were on this actual site
10847840	10850520	weren't allowed to actually give out emails
10850520	10852360	and communicate with each other.
10852360	10855880	They were only allowed to talk on this Virtual Magic Kingdom
10856840	10860280	You weren't allowed to give any personal information away.
10860280	10861600	Right, right, because you were very restricted
10861600	10862440	to what you could say.
10862440	10864320	All of a sudden they said in a month from now,
10864320	10868240	we're closing the site and it's done, that's it.
10868240	10870000	And you should just,
10870000	10873600	God, it just killed a bunch of these little kids, you know.
10873600	10876440	It's sad, but at the same time,
10876440	10878160	how can you force a company to keep something going
10878160	10879360	that's not making them any money?
10879360	10880640	Hey. Right, right.
10880640	10881480	There's a-
10881480	10883160	If the miniature golf place closes down,
10883160	10884480	what can you do about it?
10884480	10885320	Yeah.
10885320	10888800	Someone's actually made a quote replacement
10888800	10891720	called Virtual Family Kingdom.
10891720	10893280	Oh no, no, yeah, I've seen that one.
10893280	10896480	It was actually a lot, everybody jumped over to that.
10896480	10899920	That was sponsored by the Smithsonian Kingdom
10899920	10902720	or Smithsonian Institute.
10902720	10903560	Interesting.
10903560	10905560	But it was just, it was horrible.
10905560	10907480	I mean, we went over to that.
10907480	10912480	But I don't know if you guys saw the post that I put,
10912600	10914800	like you should see some of the stories that were,
10914800	10918760	there was actually people protesting in front of Disneyland
10918760	10920080	the day that it closed down.
10920080	10920920	Wow.
10920920	10921760	Because they were so upset.
10921760	10922880	Wow.
10922880	10923720	Yeah.
10923720	10926160	Well, maybe they'll be protesting on Starbucks.
10926160	10930000	The only thing that ties in with the class action lawsuit
10930000	10931520	that you guys were talking about
10931520	10933280	is I think that somebody's gonna find
10933280	10936200	a psychological loophole that's gonna say,
10936200	10939600	you close down this site that I've spent so much time into,
10941480	10943120	I'm gonna be able to get some money out of it.
10943120	10943960	I don't know.
10943960	10945640	I still think the terms of service
10945640	10948960	are gonna ultimately let the companies come out ahead.
10948960	10949800	But we'll see.
10949800	10950640	All right, we'll see.
10950640	10951480	I gotta let you go, buddy, so you wrap up the show.
10951480	10952320	All right, thank you, thank you.
10952320	10953200	Thank you for your call.
10953200	10954480	Appreciate it.
10954480	10955320	It was a good topic.
10955320	10956440	I like that.
10956440	10958040	Blender, live on OLR.
10958040	10959120	We're gonna show off the Skype line.
10959120	10960200	Sorry to you guys who didn't get through
10960200	10961240	on the Skype line tonight.
10961240	10963000	But if you wanna send us an email with your thoughts,
10963000	10964560	mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com,
10964560	10967160	or of course you can always tweet us, twitter.com slash OLR.
10967160	10968400	By the way, I found this,
10968400	10971760	you know, DJ Rama was talking about Twilight
10971760	10973600	and how much he doesn't really like Twilight,
10973600	10975040	but yet, I don't know you guys.
10975040	10976320	I got sent this YouTube,
10976320	10978920	and this is a YouTube of DJ Rama S
10978920	10982200	actually watching the Breaking Dawn trailer.
10982200	10983480	And let's see.
10983480	10985480	Let's see how Rama actually reacted
10985480	10987000	to seeing this trailer the first time.
10987000	10988560	Cool.
10988560	10990160	Fucking massive boobs.
10991440	10992280	Shh.
10994800	10995640	Ah.
10996920	10997760	Ah.
11000680	11003400	Oh my God, I'm still living in mine.
11003400	11004240	No.
11006400	11008240	God, Rama, you're getting really upset over this.
11008240	11009160	I'm so sad.
11009160	11010000	No.
11011880	11012720	No.
11013720	11015040	Don't get naked.
11016040	11017240	Don't get naked, Rama.
11017240	11018920	You were the one talking about vagina
11018920	11020760	in the chat room earlier.
11020760	11021600	No.
11024400	11025840	Stop it.
11025840	11027080	All right, let me tell you what this really is.
11027080	11029080	This is some chick.
11029080	11030680	So let me just pop, show me this video.
11030680	11032320	It goes on for seven and a half minutes.
11032320	11035320	It's a trailer reaction video to this chick.
11035320	11037680	And I guess what she did, what is this?
11037680	11040240	She was internet famous for starting
11040240	11043400	the Fuck Stephen King movement when, I guess,
11043400	11044960	Stephen King knocked the Twilight series
11044960	11046160	and said it was badly written.
11046160	11047440	And that's a video of her watching
11047440	11049480	the Breaking Dawn trailer for the first time.
11049480	11051800	Well, it was badly written.
11053640	11055240	I tried to read a page of that.
11055240	11058000	And I was like, who let this woman write?
11059880	11063360	There should be a class action lawsuit against Bic
11063360	11065040	for selling that woman a pen.
11065040	11065880	All right.
11068280	11070920	She's, I blame her for being Mormon.
11074000	11075800	I love DJ Morpheus in chat.
11075800	11077240	That's just cold, Rob.
11077240	11079920	That's coming from Travis of all people.
11081560	11083640	Dude, that's just cold.
11083640	11086000	All right, that's gonna do it for another week
11086000	11086840	Orange on Trail.
11086840	11088240	Or do we have any other last minute news?
11088240	11089080	Did I miss anything?
11089080	11090240	I think we got it.
11090240	11091240	Just real quick stuff.
11091240	11093160	I'm alive.
11093160	11094600	Supposed to be coming out still.
11094600	11096920	But because the classifications are found
11096920	11097760	on the Australian website
11097760	11099200	and Crisis is supposed to be coming
11099200	11101080	to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
11102320	11103440	Cause it is on the SRB.
11104400	11105240	All right.
11105240	11107560	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.
11107560	11108560	Before we get the final thoughts,
11108560	11109440	I wanna thank you once again
11109440	11110520	for listening to Orange on Trail
11110520	11113360	and supporting us over these nine years of our program.
11113360	11115200	Of course, we're here to do it every Sunday night.
11115200	11117280	So if you've never just come out for a live show,
11117280	11118120	it's a bummer.
11118120	11118960	Tonight would have been a great night
11118960	11120960	cause many folks out there don't work on Monday.
11120960	11123560	But you know, if you have the time in the future,
11123560	11125240	please do consider joining us for a live show.
11125240	11126680	We do tape live at All Games Radio,
11126680	11127840	allgames.com.
11127840	11130040	Sunday nights at six Pacific, nine Eastern,
11130040	11130880	right after the Bobby Blackwood show.
11130880	11132160	You always say specific.
11132160	11133680	Specific, six Pacific.
11133680	11135920	It's cause they all kind of run together.
11135920	11138000	I talk too fast for radio.
11138000	11138840	You know what?
11138840	11139680	That's why I'm stuck here.
11139680	11140500	You know what?
11140500	11141340	What?
11141340	11142960	It also goes along with like one of my pet peeves
11142960	11143800	and songs.
11143800	11146280	So people instead of saying, don't you say, don't you?
11146280	11149520	Oh, don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
11149520	11152720	I was like, you, not chew.
11152720	11155240	Chew is a sound that mice make in Japan.
11155240	11158280	Chew is a sound that what's-her-name makes
11158280	11159520	in Space Channel Five.
11159520	11160360	La la.
11160360	11161440	Because it's chew.
11161440	11162280	Ooh la la.
11162280	11163100	Ooh la la.
11163100	11164880	You know, actually Space Channel Five part two
11164880	11166960	is on Steam for six bucks.
11166960	11167780	Oh, nice.
11167780	11168620	Yeah.
11168620	11170040	I already have like two copies of it.
11170040	11170920	Very nice.
11170920	11172000	Lots of good stuff to buy on Steam.
11172000	11173120	I tell you, BitTrip Runner,
11173120	11176080	if it's still $2 and 50 cents is a great buy.
11176080	11177920	Anyhow, that's gonna do it for another episode
11177920	11178760	of Orange House Radio.
11178760	11179580	Please help spread the word.
11179580	11180760	Da da da da da.
11180760	11182800	OrangeHouseRadio.com, join our website,
11182800	11184280	check the forums, all that good stuff.
11184280	11185940	We really need to get the activity on the forums again.
11185940	11188820	I gotta really think about how we can get those going.
11188820	11190440	But meanwhile, let's go around
11190440	11192040	and get everybody's final thought for tonight.
11192040	11192920	So, Loki, we'll start with you.
11192920	11194520	What's your final thought tonight?
11194520	11195840	I need to work in some more
11195840	11199160	Earth Defense Force this weekend.
11199160	11201680	Got to play it for a few hours last night.
11201680	11203320	Really need to play more of that.
11204600	11206440	My final thought of the night is, you know what?
11206440	11208720	Vanilla and Hope, they aren't that bad.
11208720	11212220	Like 30 hours later, they aren't that bad.
11212220	11214520	Dark Soccer, your final thought?
11214520	11215620	Lesbians.
11217360	11218200	Fuck yeah.
11219360	11221080	I just looked at Alan's Twitter.
11221080	11222800	I mean, Tumblr.
11222800	11224760	Wait, what's Alan tweeting about lesbians for?
11224760	11225640	This is his picture.
11225640	11227440	Oh, and don't buy, my other final thought,
11227440	11229760	don't buy your games from eBay.
11229760	11231800	Unless they're, well, I guess the used market's okay,
11231800	11232840	but just be careful.
11232840	11234680	Be a buyer beware on eBay.
11234680	11235520	All right, that's-
11235520	11237340	Just look at the feedback before you buy.
11237340	11238760	That's it, guys, have a wonderful night.
