117848	119048	I want Rob's 360 game.
119268	120209	You only say it once.
120349	122330	If you say it more than once, you've disqualified yourself.
122970	144382	at the end we'll pick a number one through whatever of how many of you said I want Rob's 360 game and we are going to give it away right here at the top of the show this week I'll tell you more about what it is after our gaming week see that's what we do is a little thing called a radio tease it's Yaris I can say with a clean conscience this is not Yaris it is something I received for my birthday on the 360 and I'm giving it away
145782	146163	You know what?
146183	147363	We're going to sweeten the pot a little bit.
147403	151006	Not only are we going to give it away, I'm going to sign it, so is DarkSakura and Loki.
151326	153208	So it's going to be like an autographed OLR game.
153228	154348	I'll sign it with my butt.
154749	156350	And DarkSakura will sign it with her butt.
156570	156730	No.
156990	157230	Alright.
157250	158391	You're going to give it away.
158431	158571	Yep.
158771	159272	Give it away.
159372	160032	Give it away now.
160333	160613	Alright.
161713	162294	Moving on.
162454	162974	Let's start off.
163014	164455	How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
165976	168158	I played WoW.
169819	171040	I got 50 mounts today.
171060	173802	So now I have an albino drake.
175290	176491	So it has a skin condition.
178352	181814	And that's about it.
182695	183055	Next.
183295	183656	Lol.
184396	185377	You're addicted to WoW.
185657	186217	Your fault.
186918	189179	Alright, then Loki, how was your gaming week?
189199	191181	Have you been playing anything that's not WoW?
192321	198726	Of course I haven't been playing WoW, because I don't get WoW, nor would I want to play WoW.
199146	201508	No, I played more Grand Theft Auto this week.
202708	203269	Same old stuff.
204170	207435	and then of course Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon because it's awesome.
208356	217990	I got that early this week and was able to play through quite a bit of it and I'm happy to say it exceeds my expectations in every possible way.
218310	218531	It is...
220279	222721	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
241279	243521	And, um, it's just, it's very fun.
243661	246063	And the multiplayer over the internet is actually pretty fun.
246103	254470	We've been playing a few games, uh, because I picked up a few copies of it, um, between my coworkers, and it was pretty cool.
254710	259354	Tried to play some games over the weekend, though, and was unable to connect to my other coworker that has it.
259834	260255	But, uh...
261055	264597	Yeah, I'm definitely digging this game and highly recommend you pick it up.
264697	270240	I mean, it's... Depending on where you go, it may be out yesterday or out on Tuesday.
270740	274021	And there's an interesting story behind that, too.
275422	278183	But yeah, so it's really fun.
278203	281765	You know, graphics and sound are pretty good.
282545	288648	I mean, especially when you're comparing them to Earth Defense Force, you know, the first one, it's just night and day.
289208	289328	Um...
290589	291930	I mean, there's a little bit of slowdown.
291990	295652	Some of your AI are kind of dumb, but they're actually pretty smart this time around.
295672	304398	They actually do a lot of work and they don't die quite often because you have a three-man team the entire time, whether it be with players or AI.
304959	307600	And the different suits you can try out, those are kind of cool.
308441	312023	But overall, it's just a great, great game and I really...
312944	313505	I love playing.
313525	315187	In fact, I'll be playing some of it during the show.
316188	317029	Because that's what I do.
317790	318350	Be careful, though.
318370	322295	You don't want to stream it anywhere to the internet because you might get arrested for that.
322335	324137	But we'll get into that later in the show.
326317	329458	So how does this game outshine the original?
329878	330958	How's it outshine the original?
330998	338640	Well, the original was really, really, really buggy and just really cheap, but it was fun because you're fighting a bunch of different things all at once.
339060	340440	This one kind of ramps up everything.
340460	341381	The graphics are better.
342921	346182	The detail in the game, like destroying buildings and stuff, it's not just...
347802	348703	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
373530	374211	Thanks for watching!
392662	394223	Sound is actually really good in it.
394643	398504	I thought it was just really action-packed.
399825	403626	Just all the missions seem to like, oh, here, you're going to be attacked by these things.
403926	405347	Oh, and now here's this thing coming in.
405487	409848	Oh, and some dropships just came in, and they're going to be making your life hell.
410208	415090	It's just really overwhelming, and yet without being too difficult.
415630	417151	And although I am playing on the...
417751	423978	Normal mode right now because I'm starting everything off normal then going through the hard and then the Inferno which is just insane.
426189	431173	It is ramping up difficulty pretty fast, and that's the thing.
431233	447185	In each mission, whereas the first game, the missions are pretty short, and they have like 73 of them, this one, the missions have different waypoints and different things going on, and they have the game broken up into chapters with different bits of the story going on.
448026	449467	Like right now, this part I'm
449907	450408	Thanks for watching!
461840	466465	Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelongeradio.com, the ever-present fourth guest here on Orange Lounge Radio.
466866	473793	SSJ100Matt says, I played Earth Defense Force 2 at PAX East, and it really just reminded me of a next-gen version of the N64 game of Body Harvest.
474214	476356	I sadly didn't like it as much as Loki likes it.
477197	478879	Breakman says, wait, what's going on here?
478959	480360	Loki actually likes a game?
481281	483143	I like games all the time.
500081	503985	Because I look for this, I'm like... You're the only one that cares.
504185	504806	Exactly.
504866	509410	Why do you think you... And that happens in gaming sometimes.
509450	513394	Sometimes we like a game that nobody else seems to like for unexplainable reasons.
513514	514996	Why are you so drawn to this freaking game?
515016	515857	It's just fun.
516037	518079	It's kind of taking games back to where...
518866	520668	What the focus should be in any game.
520828	527275	It's not about the great, great graphics or, you know, making sure everything's cinematic and has a great story.
527456	529858	It's all about being fun, and that's what this is.
529898	532781	This is basically like a popcorn action flick or something like that.
533362	536325	The story, yeah, there's somewhat of a story there, but who gives a shit?
536425	536726	It's just...
537967	539568	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
561484	566649	I know, our intelligences have a better name for it, but that's what we're calling it.
567690	577020	There was a part where I got picked up by this one dropship, and the pilot, he's just doing all the really typical...
577760	592569	and yes, off to the left you'll see here there's a giant swarm of enemy ants attacking and you'll notice that we'll be cruising at an altitude of... It's kind of like Starship Troopers.
592709	597512	It is very much like Starship Troopers, just without all the propaganda in there.
597652	598632	It's very...
599893	600853	I don't know, it's fun.
617120	626084	and, you know, the spaceships, when they crash, they just kind of slowly sink through the ground and you could be in the path of one of them and it just clips right through you and stuff.
626404	638410	Well, this one, I mean, the actual ships, when they crash, I mean, they will take out buildings and they explode and they will possibly kill you if you're too close to it or, like, the enemy kind of spaceships are flying around.
638470	643713	If you're shooting them and they get damaged enough, they will actually try to kamikaze into you and try to destroy you that way, but...
644913	646434	It's just, it's ridiculous fun.
646454	647134	That's all it is.
647715	648475	It's a great game.
649816	653758	And really, I mean, when you look at it in the month of July, there's not a lot coming out anyways.
653818	660622	If you're not a fan of football, then you're left with Harry Potter and Call of Juarez, you know, the cartel, which I hear is kind of terrible.
662178	665899	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, at least it's not Grand Theft Auto 4, which is all he ever plays.
665919	666299	You know what?
666319	666680	True that.
666720	672261	I'm excited to hear Loki give an in-depth review to something else on the show for once.
673462	673782	All right.
676122	680584	So Dan just walked in without a mic, interrupting the show, saying that Shadows of the Damned is fucking hilarious.
680644	681424	It is a fun game.
681824	685785	I've heard this is kind of a... I haven't played it at all, but I've heard it's kind of fun too.
685905	687426	It's amazing.
688346	693593	It's a road trip movie game in hell, basically.
694234	698901	It's like very Grindhouse-ish, but it's just, I don't know, insane.
700376	701397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
721960	724062	But yeah, I bought a new headset.
724102	732449	But I saw on the shelf, for $40, I saw a copy of Dance Dance Revolution on the Xbox 360, which is the brand new one.
733089	735111	This is the reboot, quote unquote, of DDR.
735151	737873	They had the brand new game and dance pad for $40.
737993	739695	And I was like, well, you know...
740195	741356	How bad could this possibly be?
741496	743417	I like DDR.
743657	746618	Obviously, OLR was built on DDR and all that, so why not?
746658	747499	I'm going to buy this game.
747959	753742	And I took it home and played it for a little while, and I was sad because it is horrible.
753942	756043	It is a step backward for the genre.
756503	761086	It is just a terrible, terrible version of DDR.
761966	765848	And big parts of that I can really blame on the song list.
767429	768290	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
794230	794891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
813290	840737	and then the song that just made me want to crinkle up my dance pad and throw it out the window Need You Now by Lady Antebellum that's right that slow jam song country western music somehow is appropriate for DDR and I was just like I died inside so the song list is terrible the interface is set up like a what no wonder it was 30 bucks it was 40 you overpaid what's that you overpaid
843536	843956	I like this.
844076	848199	Islander in our chat says, Was Rob trying to sign his computer headphones with his butt?
849399	850020	Apparently.
850440	850860	Apparently.
852661	856603	I mean, it's not just the song list that's offensive, but the interface is just crap.
856724	858044	Like, there's really nothing to it.
858084	860666	The videos are just very generic videos.
861026	863347	They didn't even... Like, it's just... Like, they didn't even try.
863767	870892	And when you put this game next to the Universe games on DDR, which, granted, at the time they came out were just kind of okay, now...
871832	875174	You don't realize how good those fucking games were compared to this.
876515	881339	Actually, I've got the most value out of this game using the dance pad because my old one was long destroyed.
881679	884481	I've been using the dance pad to go back and play DDR Universe 1 and 2.
885062	886122	That is what I've been using it for.
887003	887463	DarkSakura.com
916235	920497	Yeah, go into our chatroom at chat.orangeonestrater.com.
920557	921778	I have an issue with websites tonight.
922038	925739	TigerClaw says, so what Sky is trying to say, DDR360 is an abomination.
926660	933263	Yes, and don't forget, this is the same game that's on the PS3, only it has move support, so whoopee, you get to wave your arms too.
933763	935904	Wait, wait, but this has vision camera support.
935944	939445	If it does, I don't know where it is, because I didn't see an option for it.
939666	941746	Does the Kinect not read the same way as a vision cam?
941786	942907	Yes, it should.
943747	946448	If it's in there, I didn't find it, and I really didn't give a shit.
947329	949430	And it's also on the Wii, and here's the hilarious part.
949450	954092	If you look up videos of the Wii version, the Wii version actually kind of looks like the arcade versions.
954592	958854	I'm saying the Wii version's interface looks better than the 360, and presumably PS3 versions.
960174	961795	So you explain that one to me.
962496	967219	All these weird combo things that are supposed to add points, I didn't even understand.
967519	972843	And then the mode where you unlock stuff is the club mode, which is just non-stop mode.
973523	974944	So that the songs come non-stop.
974984	980108	And occasionally the difficulty will just randomly change in the song, or the arrows will move faster or slower.
980348	984791	And then unexplainably, the way you unlock songs is you gain points.
988292	992213	I can't even fucking explain it.
992374	994794	This game is just poopy poopy caw caw terrible.
995114	998376	And it makes me sad as somebody who liked DDR so much.
998716	1002357	It is time for the Dance Dance Revolution franchise to be revoked from Konami.
1002617	1005538	They no longer deserve to have that franchise based on this game.
1006138	1012059	I truly believe that somehow some divine being needs to come into Konami.
1012119	1015840	I don't know how this happens, but somehow there needs to be a legal decision.
1015880	1021162	The Supreme Court should be involved in a 7-2 decision to revoke DDR from Konami.
1021202	1022642	Yes, I realize they're a Japanese company.
1022942	1023402	I don't care.
1023802	1027764	Somehow that needs to happen where they are no longer allowed to make Dance Dance Revolution.
1027964	1028404	Give it to me.
1028424	1029204	I can take care of it.
1030785	1036010	I'll clothe it, take it in, give it some shelter.
1037290	1045974	So, anyhow, by the way, by the way, while I was playing that random non-stop mode, guess what awesome DDR jam started playing?
1046054	1057760	Like, yeah, because, you know, sometimes there's, you know, there's these, there's the American songs you would expect to cross over, like some of the 80s classics, like, you know, Walk Like an Egyptian and so forth.
1058060	1061022	But, oh man, I just couldn't believe my ears.
1061482	1066405	I always thought this was such a great dance song, and I've always wanted to play this in DDR.
1066425	1066965	It's the fall of
1068343	1069443	What the crap is this?
1069463	1070444	Who is this?
1070644	1072224	I don't listen to her.
1085780	1085880	D.D.R.
1106644	1109267	Loki, hold me tight and we'll dance to Battlefield.
1109287	1112389	We could do the four-player mode.
1112890	1113771	Hold each other's hands.
1114351	1115532	Step, step, step.
1115993	1116954	Battlefield.
1117014	1118515	Did that have, like, was it the quad?
1118535	1120617	Loki, why does love feel like a battlefield?
1120717	1123980	Now, did that have the new pads with the eight arrows or some garbage?
1124080	1126483	No, it's the exact same fucking pad that came with Universe.
1126763	1130967	Like, clearly the surplus that got sent back to Konami headquarters was just packaged in this game.
1137971	1139511	Alright.
1139551	1140592	Breakman in our chatroom.
1140952	1142252	What the fuck is going on tonight?
1142332	1145734	Loki likes games, Sky is angry, and DarkSakura is quiet.
1147074	1148475	I like games all the time.
1148595	1162800	Have you heard me talk negative about Saints Row the Third, Grand Theft Auto, Motorstorm Apocalypse, I'm sure there's other games in there that I liked.
1162820	1164141	Sigh.
1164921	1175448	So in our chatroom, we have... And, and, and, this goes back a few mixes ago, but what is the fucking abomination that is the new Dynamite Rave?
1175808	1176969	What the fuck is that?
1177029	1179450	I'm not even gonna, I'm not even gonna try.
1179750	1181912	We also have Frisbee, I'm sorry, was it Frisbee?
1181952	1186335	Yeah, Frisbee in our chatroom says, this is like Kelly Clarkson in Supernova PlayStation 2.
1186815	1191158	Well, I'm so glad you brought that up, because guess what another one of those awesome songs in the tracklist is?
1198729	1200789	At least that's danceable.
1201009	1201390	Exactly.
1201430	1209911	At least, like, that one didn't, I mean, lover or hater, at least you can kind of dance to that.
1209931	1211551	Step, step, step, step, step, step, step.
1211571	1214312	Like, it has a beat.
1214372	1215952	That one, not so terrible.
1217993	1219053	But, come on.
1221813	1225454	It's all right to have, like, one of those songs in there, but not...
1226232	1226753	I get that.
1227013	1229377	Songs like that to cross over to mainstream audience, that's fine.
1229417	1231180	I don't have a problem with that song being in DDR.
1231220	1237068	But like the Jordan Sparks and Leona Lewis, and I like Leona Lewis when I'm feeling sad.
1239443	1241864	Anyhow, let me talk about a game that was a much better investment.
1241944	1244305	As you know, going on right now, Steam is having a sale.
1244905	1247246	There's tons and tons of stuff that's discounted on Steam right now.
1247286	1251808	One of the games I grabbed on sale was Bit.Trip Runner was $2.50 on Steam.
1252909	1258711	Somehow I stepped into the Twilight Zone where that's the game I should have paid $40 for and DDR was worth about $2.50.
1259151	1261352	Because Bit.Trip Runner is cool.
1261812	1265774	And I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this game because Bit.Trip beat...
1266474	1271038	was neat, but it kind of, like, the shtick got old pretty fast, so the whole Pong thing.
1272339	1273820	But I liked Bit.Trip Runner a lot.
1273860	1286810	Like, it really reminds me of an old-school 2600 game like what it would look like today, with the chiptune music, very simple controls, but a lot of that whole kind of repetition about how to learn to beat a level, and, you know, I...
1287751	1294693	Even throwbacks to the classic Atari console with the whole bonus levels looking like pitfall complete with a noisy television.
1295053	1300495	Like if you've ever tried to hook up on an old TV with the RF switch, you get that noise in there mixed with your game.
1301035	1302416	I just loved the way it looked.
1302496	1304256	A Bit.Trip Runner was a great deal for $250.
1305237	1308398	I played more of that game than I did the $40 DDR game.
1308658	1309118	Just saying.
1309378	1311639	So Bit.Trip Runner, I endorse that game especially.
1313080	1333721	you could call it a music game because yeah it involves chiptunes but to me that's kind of the niche that makes it that much more awesome to me it's just like a classic Atari game what it would look like today just the chiptune element makes it attractive to those that maybe don't always care for the simplistic games if that makes sense so
1335002	1336243	Let's see, anything else I played this week?
1336283	1337304	I checked out some demos.
1337424	1346430	I don't always like to review games based on the demos, but I'll quickly say I checked out the 32nd Hero Super Mega Neo Climax game on the Xbox 360.
1346810	1349772	I own the PSP version of that, so I wanted to see what it looked like on 360.
1350072	1354595	I like how the 360 has the completely different art modes that look completely different.
1354876	1362341	They have the cel-shaded hand-drawn mode, which is pretty cool, but they also have the retro mode, which looks more like the PSP version or an 8-bit Nintendo classic.
1362741	1364202	So that was pretty cool.
1364942	1390807	um let's see uh and um what was the other demo I played oh Galaga Legions DX I think I'm gonna buy that one that one was really cool that was kind of like Geometry Wars with the whole Pac-Man Championship Edition elements in it with the music and everything because by the same team if I'm not mistaking but it played a little more like Geometry Wars but it doesn't play like the old Galaga games at all so I thought that was kind of neat
1392062	1395105	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1395746	1399550	Ezam in our chatroom says, Bit.Trip is more rhythm puzzle than anything else.
1399870	1400691	Yeah, I can see that.
1401212	1403114	Rhythm puzzle, I think, is a good way to describe it.
1405475	1410680	Let's see, going into our chatroom, Blackwolf says, hey, that's not the Glee version, that sucks.
1411281	1414324	And Breakman says, I hear Glee versions of songs every time I go to Target.
1414524	1418368	Yeah, that's the other awesome music franchise that Konami's doing right now, Glee Karaoke Revolution.
1419049	1419350	Awesome.
1419390	1419990	But you know what?
1420631	1423854	It sells for them, I guess.
1424435	1426937	I mean, I don't know.
1427438	1428259	Yeah, I don't know either.
1428949	1437555	I bet you all are dying to know more about the game that I'm giving away here on the program.
1438575	1441557	At the top of the show I said, who wants to win my birthday present?
1442237	1443458	And we are going to give that away.
1443578	1446060	But to tell us more about the birthday present...
1446780	1448601	I'm going to call the person who bought it for me.
1448721	1451702	And this is my significant other, Salacious Pop, that we're going to bring on the line.
1452062	1452863	Yes, that's right.
1452963	1455724	I'm giving away the present that my significant other bought for me.
1456104	1457045	And we're going to talk about why.
1457945	1462547	He actually ordered a copy of Child of Eden for me online.
1463167	1468049	And I want to talk about why we are giving away, once it arrived, why we're giving it away.
1468329	1469850	Hi, Salacious Pop, are you there?
1469870	1469970	Hello.
1470595	1470755	Yeah.
1470895	1471075	Well, I...
1491488	1494129	decided that that was definitely what you needed to get for your birthday.
1494249	1504011	So I went on a hunt online to try and find it at a good price because I wasn't really prepared to, you know, drop the 60 bones or whatever it costs at Target.
1504812	1512574	So I checked out Amazon and a bunch of other sites and I just wasn't happy with, you know, how, what they were offering it for.
1513314	1516975	So I ended up through Google Shopping, I ended up on eBay and
1518666	1521590	I'm sure already some people in the studio might know where this story is going.
1522451	1532906	I found a lot of retailers with tens of thousands of feedback positive score that I could have got it from, but I found this one sort of dog and pony show seller with a feedback score of five or six.
1533912	1543439	and selling Child of Eden and a bunch of other games like Halo Reach and Madden 11 and a bunch of other stuff new shrink-wrapped in America for what I thought was a good price.
1544099	1546721	And at least it was a feedback of one or higher.
1546781	1548422	It wasn't some new eBay account, right?
1548522	1554106	Yeah, it was five, which is still pretty low for the fact they had like 80 auctions running at once.
1554619	1557281	So I was like, all right, I am going to give this a shot.
1557321	1561044	And I sell a ton of stuff on eBay and I take it very seriously.
1561164	1566107	So I think I kind of projected the fact that I'm a legit EJ seller onto this stranger person.
1566788	1568109	So I buy it.
1569089	1575654	And three days later, when I get my tracking number, I see that for one, I notice that they closed their account.
1575954	1579056	So they've unregistered from eBay and their feedback score is now zero.
1581798	1584200	And I look at the tracking number and it is from China.
1585439	1592104	and anyone who ever orders anything on eBay knows that if your item comes from China, it is a counterfeit.
1592164	1598529	It's a bootleg because the piracy market over in China and Taiwan is millions and millions of dollars of counterfeit titles.
1598609	1603833	So I was like, well, shit, it's going to take this game three weeks to get to me and it's obviously fake.
1605074	1607716	So it arrived on Thursday.
1608197	1610519	I open it and here's the punchline.
1610579	1612420	Yes, it is a counterfeit.
1612520	1613241	Obviously, it's
1613982	1618644	I'm surprised at how good the quality is, but it's not good enough.
1618824	1623527	Like, you can tell, like, wow, they printed this on a very high-quality, expensive color laser printer.
1623607	1625568	Yeah, it definitely looks like a color copy.
1626208	1632811	But it's very high-quality, but if you look closely, you can just kind of see that ink, inkjet little dotting.
1632851	1633391	You know what I mean.
1633431	1636893	If you ever look at an original and an inkjet side-by-side, you can tell the difference.
1638157	1647301	Yeah, so obviously it's a counterfeit, and if you look at the underside of the disc, you can see that it's like a DVD-R that they just bought a huge spindle of them.
1647901	1657106	But the game wasn't even a counterfeit Child of Eden, it was a counterfeit PAL edition, so they bootlegged the European version, of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
1658526	1661828	So it's a bootlegged game from China...
1662935	1665577	That's the PAL version, Whammy number two.
1665838	1668820	That's the wrong counterfeit game from what I ordered, Whammy number three.
1669501	1673104	So that is some Yakety Sax, Benny Hill-themed shit right there.
1673324	1682652	So we want to give, and before we had the call tonight, I asked you to pick a number from one, two, of all the people in chat who said that they wanted my 360 game.
1682672	1683893	So we want to congratulate...
1684963	1697190	Kaijudo won a copy, bootleg copy of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood PAL edition on the Xbox 360 signed by DarkSakura's butt.
1700252	1701292	My birthday present.
1702173	1705795	Because I care about the listeners, I am giving away my birthday present.
1707056	1711658	So, yeah, I opened a case for it on eBay and I'm confident that I'm gonna get my money back.
1712399	1712519	Um...
1713194	1720369	The price that I got it for was sort of in that nebulous, too good to be true, but I could see someone selling the game for cheap at this amount.
1720748	1748482	so even if I get screwed over which I doubt I will it's not a horrible heartbreaking amount of money but come on eBay it's not completely unreasonable for someone to sell stuff for cheap for example I take games sometimes that I get for free and I just don't want them and I don't really care what I get for them so I start the auction at one penny and whatever they end at that's what they sell for so a lot of times you know I think Brink was one that went recently it went for $24 so it's not unreasonable for that to happen
1749346	1750547	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1769699	1775745	I sold them on the adult section of eBay for a penny and some of them only went for $10 and they were perfectly brand new retail good items.
1775905	1778268	So I absolutely understand how that could happen.
1778428	1789018	So you thought maybe you'd find somebody like you who was just giving away their excess promo copies of Child of Eden but unfortunately you got a PAL copy that's not even real of Assassin's Creed.
1789079	1790440	Of a game that I didn't order, yes.
1790620	1790960	Exactly.
1791261	1793903	So TigerClaw in our chatroom says, what's the moral of the story?
1794003	1795304	Don't order from Amazon.
1796124	1797646	Actually, I think you got the moral mixed up.
1797746	1799667	It's don't order from eBay.
1800628	1806973	Order from a, quote, legit store like Amazon or Best Buy or Fry's or whatever the hell you want.
1807353	1810756	Thankfully, even though PayPal is evil, usually...
1811647	1816350	WTF, if I would ever try to give away a gift from my girl, she would fucking kill me.
1816370	1819071	So are you going to fucking kill me, SalaciousPop?
1837666	1843091	Well, we've found an even better solution to get you your Child of Eden fix, and I get to play it too.
1843211	1845093	So no, I'm not too heartbroken over this.
1845414	1847616	And we can go ahead and share what we ended up doing instead.
1847656	1851500	It's actually kind of, in an ironic way, it's actually kind of funny this worked out this way.
1852081	1858528	Yeah, a listener of OLR, I'm trying to think of his name.
1858548	1858908	Nicholas Austin.
1860672	1877389	his screen name Miklatov called us today Miklatov told us that on BestBuy.com or the brick and mortar store if you have one nearby for today and tomorrow Kinect games are two for one so we picked up Child of Eden and
1878341	1882264	and a fitness game that looked like a fitness game that wasn't actually horrible.
1883024	1886486	We got both of those, so that's your birthday present are those two games.
1886506	1888107	So I ended up getting a two-for-one deal out of it.
1888127	1888847	Which fitness game?
1888867	1889768	I think the Year Fitness.
1890168	1890708	Oh, that's not bad.
1890949	1892590	Yeah, because, no, trust me, we looked.
1892610	1895171	We're like, okay, Zumba Fitness is the one that's selling really well in Europe.
1895511	1896312	Went to Metacritic.
1896352	1897733	It's like 40-something.
1897773	1901475	Unless you like Latin dancing, and I'm talking about Latin female dancing.
1901535	1902996	I do like Latin female dancing.
1903016	1903216	Yeah.
1904540	1905060	Yeah, it was.
1905140	1910002	Yeah, Your Shape Fitness Evolved, which I think is like a 74 on Metacritic for a fitness game.
1910022	1910602	That's pretty good.
1910642	1911122	That was pretty good.
1911142	1917384	They have the sequel coming out this year, but I mean... We just kind of went to Metacritic and picked the one with the best score, and that's the one we went with.
1918024	1923085	Because we were like, well, let's get a fitness game, because I've actually kind of been into fitness and all that stuff lately, like trying to walk more, eat better.
1923405	1927146	I've lost seven pounds in the past two months, so I kind of want to keep that trend going without having to join a gym.
1927406	1929327	So, it'd be cool.
1930321	1936005	Also, Breakman in chat says, so basically someone wins Sky's coffee table drink coaster.
1936325	1938506	Hey, I never said it was a good game.
1938846	1940187	Why do you think I was giving it away?
1941888	1944389	But Kaijudo says, I will put that game up on a plaque.
1944429	1947111	So I'm glad someone won it who will appreciate it.
1947491	1948792	So congratulations once again.
1948832	1959038	You win my birthday bootleg PAL copy of the wrong fucking game, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, signed by myself, Loki, and DarkSakura's butt.
1960217	1988839	and uh I think doesn't Loki probably has a system somewhere that would play it that was actually my first reaction I'm like one of Loki's like 10 360s could probably play this game I don't have 10 360s no my my JTAG which which by the way I broke this week but I will be fixing it um yes I would probably be able to play that but Loki I've decided I'm gonna give it to a listener instead in fact uh Dan's JTAG out there probably could play it all right well oh well
1989301	1992584	Alright, Salacious Pop, while we have you on, anything else you want to share with the listeners?
1993905	1997569	Just that really insane Steam sale that's running, I think, all week.
1997649	1998710	People need to get on that.
1998810	1999651	Some great stuff on there.
2000011	2000752	Yes, indeed.
2001152	2001913	And win tickets.
2002213	2004095	And join the OLR group while you're on there.
2004175	2005116	Hooray.
2005356	2006657	More information at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
2006937	2007618	Okay, take care.
2008439	2009159	Thank you, Salacious Pop.
2009660	2009820	Bye.
2011101	2038819	and it really is one of those situations where it's the thought that counts like I just laughed it off like I kind of knew he was getting me Child of Eden because when I tried to buy it in the store he's like don't you want to wait till after your birthday to buy any big purchases like that you know that whole little thing so I kind of knew that was coming but you know the story behind it is even better than just the game showing up on the doorstep you know and you even said ahead of time that you felt or that Alan felt something like that might happen
2039133	2039894	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2057365	2057646	Team Fortress 2
2076884	2106100	Or Portal 2, your copies on PS3 that work on Steam, what have you We actually do have our own little Steam community And you can see that on our website, orangelauntrader.com On the left hand side is a little button for Steam In the extended play section Steamcommunity.com slash groups slash OLR So there you go Alright, let's get into tonight's news There actually is a lot of gaming news too this week So let's get right into it Loki, start us off, what's going on in the news?
2106950	2110771	Yes, we talked a little bit about this on our tease with Bobby.
2111211	2114672	But Resident Evil Mercenary 3D just came out last week.
2114992	2119493	And there was a big controversy over the fact that Capcom decided, hey, guess what?
2119513	2122993	You know that save game data that you have on there?
2123573	2124674	It cannot be reset.
2124834	2130255	So, for example, say you get really far in the game and you decide to sell it.
2130475	2136156	And then the next person that buys it, they're stuck with your save game and having everything being unlocked.
2138397	2164927	it was funny because actually at one point GameStop and a lot of the major retailers out there were not going to be taking the game in as a trade I guess they've reversed their policy on that but they're saying upon further review of the process with our publisher partner Capcom GameStop will resume taking trades on the game effective Wednesday June 29th makes me wonder a couple things here one
2166912	2169398	So, GameStop probably bitched to Capcom.
2171994	2173995	GameStop Employee GameStop Employee GameStop Employee
2197317	2200962	Overseas, though, it says retailer HMV has ceased taking trades in for the title.
2201402	2204786	EB Games Australia has also stopped stocking the game altogether.
2205607	2212555	And, you know, they're just saying if, you know, EB Games, I guess, if you would like to purchase it with us, then of course we will sell it to you.
2213075	2217658	It will be a case of an order with our store.
2217978	2223501	We made the tough decision to remove it from sale because we had everybody's best interest in mind.
2223541	2230685	I don't feel that it's fair that you guys would be paying $60 Australian for what is essentially a one-use game.
2233408	2242796	So, I mean, let's get back to the root problem here, because amongst the whole 9th anniversary show and the fact that this news kind of came out on a Sunday last week, we kind of overlooked this story.
2244337	2248721	In what fucking universe was this a good game design idea to not reset the save file?
2248801	2254506	Like, I get the defense as the whole, well, it's like an arcade game, and...
2256407	2278918	I'm just saying that is the defense I'm not saying I understand it but that is the whole like well it's it's like an arcade game and it's not detrimental so what like I hate it when game companies try to tell me what I want as a gamer because that's what the gamers want no I'm telling you that's not what I want I do sometimes like to reset my games well here's the thing about I did it on Final Fantasy 13 a few weeks ago
2279278	2280820	It's like an arcade game, okay?
2280980	2282001	That's your defense then?
2282562	2284884	Arcade cabinets I can reset the goddamn high score.
2284964	2288188	In fact, Capcom arcade games I can reset the high score on.
2288828	2291251	So, where's your logic there?
2293002	2293823	It doesn't make sense.
2293923	2315680	I mean, clearly, somebody made this decision, and I think this decision absolutely was made to impact the used market, because somebody made a conscious decision not to let the game save to the 3DS card, internal memory, like all the other freaking 3DS games do, where if you wanted to reset your data, oh, it's as easy as deleting the file.
2316321	2317122	How easy is that?
2318027	2320311	Somebody made the conscious decision, no, we don't want to do that.
2320351	2324939	We're specifically moving it to the cart and not making it deletable.
2327688	2335094	Yet now they've come up with all this crap to kind of backtalk their way into how that was a great decision and it's where the game industry is going.
2335555	2336536	It's really what you wanted.
2336696	2337657	Yeah, it's what we wanted.
2338297	2340539	You wanted an arcade experience, didn't you?
2341159	2346084	No, I didn't really want to play the Mercenary missions from 4 and 5 ported to the 3DS.
2346284	2348926	I would like, I don't know, maybe a new Resident Evil game.
2349406	2349947	Oh, but guess what?
2349967	2354691	You can play the demo for the new Resident Evil game on this game itself.
2354831	2354991	So...
2356696	2357957	I guess there's something to it.
2358918	2364863	But once again, you know, I mean, to be fair, it didn't get very good reviews because apparently the game wasn't that great.
2365624	2368026	And so, you know, I don't really consider a big loss.
2369007	2372911	It's interesting, though, because this news story yet has people talking about it.
2373291	2381899	And despite the fact it was a mediocre game that probably, you know, the Resident Evil fans would have been, yay, but most other people would have been like, bring on the other 3DS games.
2382942	2389004	It's another entry in the long line of bad DRM decisions from Capcom.
2389404	2395266	If it's not, oh, this game needs to be online at all times in order for it to work even in single player.
2396266	2403889	Or in games that don't even have a multiplayer component, oh, and then the PlayStation Network goes down and their game stops working for a month or whatever.
2404409	2407790	Alright, so I'm being corrected by the chat room as tends to happen sometimes on this show.
2407850	2412292	BlackWolf in our chat says, actually Rob, none of the 3DS games I have saved to the SD card.
2412692	2415953	They all save to the 3DS card, but you can do data management.
2416233	2420875	The only things that save to the SD card are the street pass and maybe data that won't fit on the card.
2421235	2428738	So fine, I just haven't noticed because there hasn't really been that big RPG 3DS game that I've wanted to reset the data on so far.
2429474	2435757	I mean, when all is said and done, would I probably really want to reset the data on a game like this?
2435937	2436817	Probably not.
2436997	2437878	Me, personally.
2438178	2438958	Probably not.
2439478	2442279	I probably wouldn't have noticed this if it hadn't been called out.
2442700	2446241	But what ticks me off about it is this whole, we all see what you're doing.
2446501	2448982	Quit trying to make excuses to say otherwise.
2449362	2452103	Like, it's very obvious why they're doing this.
2452564	2453344	Stop lying.
2453484	2455566	It's because they don't want to piss off the fans.
2455586	2459609	They don't want to piss off the fans because they're trying to do this to save some money.
2460950	2464352	Then they are assuming that their fans are stupid and you should be offended.
2464392	2466074	And really, how much money are they saving?
2466174	2470537	Because this game itself is probably going to sell, what, maybe 400,000 units?
2471118	2473519	And that right there is a really...
2475280	2476540	Generous estimate.
2476580	2479061	I mean, 400,000 units in the lifetime of this game.
2480601	2489663	I mean, we're talking like, you know, maybe a few 10,000 copies or whatever that they're going to lose out sales on because someone's going to buy it used.
2490843	2498225	And, okay, say like 25% of those copies are going to sell for used or something like that.
2499165	2502550	How many people are you really turning away from putting this feature on there?
2502911	2505514	I mean, what, maybe let's just say 10,000 of those people.
2505614	2512744	I mean, that's such a minor, minor, minor number compared to, you know, people are just not going to give a shit or they just won't buy your game.
2512925	2513105	I mean...
2518190	2526761	BlackWolf in our chatroom says Hey, this is an investment opportunity Buy 5 copies this week, save them for 3 years and sell them as unopened on eBay for $100 each.
2526981	2531247	Profit I don't know if that will work if the game is only kind of mediocre
2531927	2535370	Uh, however, I say at the end of the day, vote with your wallet.
2535530	2536851	That's really what it boils down to.
2537331	2541954	Now, to be honest, I probably wouldn't have bought this game anyway, but I especially wouldn't have bought it.
2541974	2545577	Like, if I was on the fence, I would have said, no, I don't really want to support this methodology.
2545597	2549799	Well, see, that's what was going through my head the whole time, is why the crap would I buy that game?
2550280	2552261	There hasn't been a good Resident Evil game since 3.
2552321	2554743	Uh, come on, 4?
2554983	2555503	I didn't like it.
2555724	2559326	Oh, oh my god, that's one of the best GameCube games ever.
2559326	2559966	Period.
2560287	2561808	Like, I realize everybody has their own opinion.
2561828	2562148	That's fine.
2562168	2564729	But I cannot agree with you.
2564749	2566450	My favorite to this day is still 2.
2566671	2569432	4 was, like, one of the best games they had.
2569532	2570973	And I really liked Code Veronica.
2570993	2571414	Period.
2572514	2572794	Wow.
2572995	2573315	All right.
2573795	2576697	But I would be with you that 5 was not what it could have been.
2576717	2577197	No, 5 was not.
2577838	2578138	Anyhow.
2579238	2580459	Yeah, vote with your wallet, kids.
2580519	2581660	That's really what it boils down to.
2582532	2601008	All right, now, speaking of fun money-related decisions and what you support and what you don't, where the industry is going, last week on the show we talked about the impending Supreme Court decision, and I gotta admit, we were a little bit in the negative defeatist realm last week where we were pretty sure that it was gonna come out and
2601408	2602109	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2626144	2639660	So in Brown vs. Entertainment Merchants Association, which used to be Schwarzenegger vs. Entertainment Merchants Association, but we've had a new governor since the law first went into effect, it was reversed in a 7-2 decision.
2640081	2640281	So...
2641903	2642784	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2659827	2663468	We understand why there might be a law, just this wasn't really the way to do it.
2663548	2666128	The way you're defining offensive here is a little vague.
2666148	2666788	Things like that.
2667208	2671689	So is this all going to be said and done and over with?
2672589	2673790	I guarantee you it's not.
2673930	2681551	In fact, there was some reaction this week from Leland Yee, who was the state senator who originally drafted this whole bill in the first place.
2682271	2685292	He's a Democrat representing San Francisco.
2685932	2705479	and he put together a whole little statement that said that the ruling of the Supreme Court puts the interests of corporate America before the interests of children as a result of their decision Walmart and the video game industry will continue to make billions of dollars at the expense of our kids mental health and the safety of our community good god
2705879	2709500	But if you read the terms... He clearly didn't read the syllabus.
2710580	2712020	Because... And I read the whole thing.
2713160	2718721	It goes in there to say that the research that they used was inherently flawed.
2719181	2733764	And that actually the same researchers who were trying to make the claim that violent video games were harmful to children said also television, movies, books, Saturday morning cartoons...
2734724	2735925	were all equally harmful.
2737547	2740670	Well, on top of all that, he's saying it's in the interest of children.
2740850	2751141	Well, children aren't able to purchase, I mean, as it is with the company policies, they're unable to purchase these games in these stores.
2751541	2753723	And last time I checked, you know,
2754264	2754844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2779346	2789014	Also, these same parents, keep in mind, are encouraging their kids to go play high school football and participate in sports where far more injuries occur as opposed to those related to video games.
2790215	2790575	And deaths.
2790795	2791456	Oh, don't forget deaths.
2794410	2802117	So, by the way, Leland Yee, at the end of the day, basically said he's going to try again because there were a couple people on the fence.
2802137	2802778	Oh, no, of course.
2802818	2804700	You haven't wasted enough taxpayer money yet.
2805161	2805721	I would like this.
2806101	2808524	Okay, so you guys lost the case, Leland Yee.
2809165	2812027	So you're going to pony up that $2 million that we wasted on this?
2812688	2814230	You know what else is very interesting about this?
2814510	2821257	You hear a lot about partisan politics in this nation and this whole Republican, Democrat stuff going on here.
2821357	2825882	This really is one of those things that doesn't seem to fall on one party or the other.
2826643	2829086	Yes, a Democrat wrote it, but then when you look at who
2829827	2835493	and the Supreme Court decided to dissent against the majority and actually side with Leland Yee.
2835953	2841019	One of those justices was Clarence Thomas, who was a Herbert Walker Bush nominee to the court.
2841299	2844383	The other one being Breyer, a Clinton appointee to the court.
2844443	2847066	This isn't partisan either, which is interesting.
2848395	2855137	I think there's so many issues in America where it's like, you know, it's a Republican issue or it's a Democrat issue, but this is one of those things that's really all over the map.
2855157	2856978	Partisan politics is bullshit anyway.
2858238	2861599	It's trying to add regulation for something that there's already regulation for.
2862760	2869842	I suggest that they go in there and we need to enact some sort of force that'll go out there and stop people from committing laws.
2870262	2871062	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2899549	2918901	and and that you know they understand parents have a right to want a little bit more assistance from the government and which I think is bullshit but um the whole point is that it's basically the government shall not step in on your personal liberties we've already had enough of that going on this is where we draw the line
2919900	2924321	I don't understand the whole needing for education for the ESRB ratings.
2925002	2928043	Does anybody need education for the movie MPA ratings?
2928203	2931924	I've never seen somebody go, oh, I don't know what an R-rated movie has in it.
2932024	2935285	I mean, does that ever confuse anybody?
2935345	2938946	Because I see no point to this excuse anyways.
2939266	2944488	Oh, as a parent, I don't understand English on the back of my box that says violence, nudity.
2944728	2946608	Does this game contain violence and nudity?
2946828	2948349	Oh, well, it says right there that it does.
2948369	2948669	I mean,
2948989	2957110	But the issue, and I'm not even going to say this flat out as a parental issue, I'm going to say this as an essentially American issue, people are fucking lazy.
2957951	2959331	Nobody wants to think for themselves.
2959771	2965412	They want everything handed to them on a plate that says, here, here's everything spelled out for you, so now it's easy.
2965832	2967592	We're going to take out the hard work part of it.
2967692	2971533	Did you see the part, did you see the whole thing being discussed on the Daily Show?
2971793	2974033	Did you see that whole clip of Jon Stewart talking about it?
2974053	2976674	I watched some of it in the moment that he said he supported it, I left the room.
2976774	2977154	Well, I...
2978454	3004055	I didn't think I didn't get that impression necessarily supported it it sure seemed like it watching it but then there was part of me that was like it was very tongue-in-cheek like is this kind of like tongue-in-cheek onion style humor that maybe we're just not getting because what amazed me about it is as he was talking about the bill and you know these horrible games that would be sold yet he was showing clips uncensored of the games on his program that I could just turn on my television and watch and
3005211	3006632	But granted, primetime.
3007232	3012354	I was like, surely this is just highbrow humor that I'm not getting.
3012715	3014195	No, I think he was actually serious.
3014655	3029022	If you knew nothing about the issue at all and you were just presented this, oh, hey, there was a law that was going to ban these violent games from ending up in children's laps, then you could see, oh, well, why did they vote against that?
3029042	3032544	I mean, that doesn't make any sense why they would vote against these violent games going in kids' laps.
3033164	3040134	Until you explain that, hey, there's already regulation in place, you know, done by these retailers where they're not selling this stuff to people.
3040614	3046723	And there's also not this sort of regulation, you know, done by the law for any other type of media, including TV.
3047103	3047364	So...
3048445	3051588	I mean, that's the point that he forgot to point out.
3051688	3059475	But because, you know, it's more interesting to have, you know, this violent imagery on screen and him going, you know, just because that gets him.
3059996	3069825	One point that Dan brought up was that now this might set a precedent for people to basically sue a company for not selling the game like when they've sent their kid in to go buy it.
3070425	3074289	And the company says no, but it is part of the business that you have.
3074429	3074809	DarkSakura.com
3093206	3095748	Violent enough to fall under this, that's the problem with it.
3119649	3121370	Go into our chatroom at chat.org.com.
3121390	3127611	Salacious Pop is actually commenting in our chatroom right now and saying, Loki, there's actually two movies where that happened, and I think talking about some of the violence.
3128211	3132052	Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which was PG, made parents flip their shit.
3132372	3134153	It's why PG-13 was invented.
3134493	3135053	That's right.
3135173	3138054	I saw faces melting when I was a kid, and I turned out okay.
3139214	3139935	Remember that scene?
3159850	3161412	It was in Pee-wee's Big Adventure.
3161932	3162793	Oh, my God!
3163954	3166216	When he gets in the truck with Large Marge.
3166296	3167577	And she does this.
3167817	3168698	Oh, my God.
3168718	3169378	She's telling the story.
3169839	3172541	On a night just like this.
3173242	3173462	Right?
3173542	3176485	And then she goes, and it looked like this.
3176505	3176805	What?
3177345	3179788	The whole claymation thing, right?
3180028	3184613	Little kids bursting into tears across the country, scarred for life.
3185554	3187455	I still can't watch that scene.
3187736	3189678	It's why we are afraid of truckers.
3190318	3191920	Our generation is afraid of truckers.
3191940	3192961	My daddy was a trucker.
3193482	3194903	He actually still is.
3196244	3196905	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3215743	3217303	Do not find the damn picture, Rob.
3217383	3217804	Oh, my God.
3217824	3218024	No, no, no.
3218044	3218704	I'm not finding the picture.
3218724	3220364	I just want to make sure the movie was rated PG.
3221325	3221825	Where was it?
3221885	3222645	I think it was.
3223885	3226146	Check IMDb.
3226306	3229347	See, look, I can't figure out what this freaking movie is rated.
3229367	3230287	Like, should it be this typical?
3230307	3230907	Rob, IMDb.
3231087	3231587	IMDb.
3233028	3238089	But, you know, actually, there was one movie that I saw when I was a kid, and it was rated R movie, and I went to see it with my uncle.
3239489	3242030	I've seen tons of rated R movies when I was a little kid.
3243058	3243558	It's PG.
3244039	3244899	Thank you, IMDB.
3245880	3248262	And this is the only movie rated R that ever scared me.
3249283	3251504	And now, today, you will laugh at this.
3251644	3251885	What?
3251985	3252925	It was Poltergeist 3.
3253466	3254547	Oh, wow.
3254567	3256308	That I was afraid of mirrors for like a week.
3257349	3257849	Have you seen it?
3258490	3258670	Mm-hmm.
3259611	3260772	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3279311	3280572	Look at any Disney movie.
3281252	3282452	I mean, okay, Tarzan.
3283432	3285253	We've all seen that Disney movie, right?
3285793	3286393	Yeah.
3286814	3292675	Spoiler alert, the main villain dies in the movie by being strangled to death.
3293656	3297777	By falling down with vines wrapped around his neck, with his neck broken.
3298217	3299278	Yeah, I remember seeing that.
3299298	3300678	And they show the silhouette of it.
3300858	3303139	I was like, this is very violent for kids.
3303579	3305080	Or how about Snow White?
3305140	3311265	Almost all Disney villains die by falling off a cliff and then you just see that little poof of smoke that rises from the bottom.
3311285	3312706	Or how about Snow White?
3313647	3317129	Movie from, what was it, 1947, wasn't it?
3319191	3327217	The queen is the old witch trying to push the boulder down the hill and instead lightning strikes her, she falls off the cliff and the boulder lands on her.
3327237	3328098	Yeah.
3328818	3329098	Okay?
3329479	3329699	Right?
3330820	3337105	Anyhow, lots of people in chat talking about the Large Marge scene and how actually there were a lot of people that apparently were scared by that.
3337225	3339587	Dungeon Buster mentions the death of Optimus Prime.
3340207	3340647	Let's see.
3341208	3342929	I hope I'm saying this right.
3343049	3348173	Rade, or maybe that's Raid, Rade says, Oh Jesus, Large Marge, that scarred me for life.
3348594	3350935	Breakman says, Yeah, that was scary because it was so unexpected.
3351075	3352897	And Frisbee says, I still can't watch that.
3354386	3355166	So you're not alone.
3355487	3358208	And of course, SSJ100 Matt provides a YouTube link if you want to see that.
3358708	3360409	Zether, another one here.
3360449	3363050	The boat scene in Willy Wonka scared me shitless.
3363090	3365151	Dude, that movie was fucked up.
3365531	3365972	It was.
3367092	3367873	I don't like the new one.
3368473	3369914	The old one is far more fucked up.
3369954	3375456	I appreciate them both, but the old one, I was actually a child when I saw the old one, and it was kind of fucked up.
3375556	3376277	I was a little afraid.
3376317	3379098	When she's a bad egg and she falls through the chute and all these...
3379438	3391344	I want the world, I want the whole world There is no way of knowing where exactly we are going I was afraid of Gene Wilder when I was little For a while For a while
3392614	3393474	Our whole generation.
3393554	3396035	I mean, where do you think... Why are we not more screwed up?
3397735	3398715	And yet we all turned out fine.
3398955	3399835	Yeah, we turned out fine.
3400395	3404456	I'm not saying that kids should be subjected to this violence.
3404476	3404996	Oh, come on.
3405016	3406696	But I think that's a parent's decision to make.
3406716	3409097	I saw Star Trek V in the theater and I'm not fucked up.
3409177	3409857	And that was awful.
3409937	3418418	I think any parent that's saying, I didn't know what this game was rated or I didn't know that this game had violence in it or I didn't know this is just retarded.
3418579	3421099	And if you're like, I didn't know how to read the rating system...
3421879	3422679	You're an idiot.
3422699	3424760	Keep in mind what our old Saturday morning cartoons were like.
3425260	3431243	You know, I realize I don't have kids, so maybe some people are not going to value my opinion, but whatever, F you, it's my show.
3433243	3439066	If I had kids, I would want them to see that violence the first time, because they're going to see it.
3439286	3440726	They're going to see it at a friend's house.
3440766	3442527	They're going to see it at some point.
3442667	3443927	They're going to see it on CNN.
3443947	3447429	They're going to see it when they're flipping through the TV, and they'll see it on Comedy Central, okay?
3448189	3451653	I don't understand the double standard between sexual stuff and violent stuff.
3468212	3475455	I'll, regardless of the ESRB rating, I'm just going to pick games that I think are suitable for my child.
3475975	3482437	And that may be different than, like, honestly, if you teach them well enough, they know what fiction is, I mean...
3484261	3487063	The people that I'm killing in Grand Theft Auto aren't real people.
3487403	3491405	And obviously you don't want to go emulate that on the street by going and killing real people.
3491485	3496568	But they're just AI computer controlled people.
3497589	3499570	You can brutally murder them and nothing happens.
3500511	3502432	My point was going back to Saturday morning cartoons.
3502452	3506034	How many of us grew up with Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinx?
3506465	3506805	Tom and Jerry
3534282	3538445	You know, I grew up watching Tom and Jerry with, you know, Tom and Blackface.
3538625	3542007	We watched Tom and Jerry cartoons in church.
3542687	3544428	I went to a Baptist church when I was younger.
3545049	3546390	We'll save that discussion for another day.
3546590	3547250	I was raised in one.
3547510	3548191	Yeah.
3548511	3552613	I remember there was a lock-in, quote-unquote, at the church once, and we watched Tom and Jerry cartoons all night.
3552813	3556256	So... We watched Song of the South.
3556876	3557336	Oh, God.
3557676	3558057	All right, look.
3558557	3561279	I want to move on to other topics, but I... But the point...
3563101	3564921	The point is that parents need to do their job.
3565362	3568542	It's better that you were there with them to explain it than leave them unexposed.
3568562	3573944	You know, I did actually know somebody who was pretty much blocked from everything when she was growing up.
3574704	3576824	And I didn't know her while she was growing up.
3576964	3577644	My friends knew her.
3578225	3584126	But from what I understand, she was a lot more messed up than anyone I know who grew up exposed to everything.
3584915	3586636	Let me quickly get some comments from chatroom.
3586656	3587876	Chat.orange.com.
3587896	3591518	Breakman says, if I ever have kids, I refuse to use cutesy names for things.
3591638	3595059	I want my kids to know that they have a penis or vagina, not a wee-wee or a hoo-hoo.
3596380	3597941	Bonds006 says, I agree.
3598001	3602043	My mom had us watch a lot of adult shows and movies, and personally, I don't think it messed me up.
3602943	3607545	And then DungeonBuster says, I love the Penn & Teller bullshit show where they looked at violent video games.
3607745	3608646	That was good.
3608826	3610427	Actually, I'll have to find you the clip.
3610947	3616751	They get a 13-year-old with his mother's permission, put a gun in his hand, and they have a trainer there.
3617171	3617832	It's supervised.
3617852	3618833	There's a police officer there.
3619513	3623075	They give him an automatic weapon and say, okay, go ahead and shoot it once.
3623115	3623836	This is how you do it.
3624236	3626438	Shows him the proper everything.
3626558	3626998	Oh, God.
3627198	3630561	The kid shoots the gun, steps back, and says, wow.
3630641	3631721	And the guy goes, do you want to do it again?
3631741	3633563	He says, no, I don't want to touch this thing again.
3633983	3636284	And then they showed him later on that he was in tears, 13 years old.
3638917	3653002	But he goes home and plays SOCOM and all these violent games, yet is this the reaction that those people who are putting out that propaganda want to think is going to happen?
3654002	3676031	I don't know if I would go to that extreme to teach my child but then again I have an issue with guns but we'll save that for another episode of the show but you get the point you're saying no I do I do the point was do these games train kids to be killers and clearly not first of all he didn't even hit the target or like he hit like way off right and second of all he didn't even want to touch it again
3677338	3678359	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3699961	3705785	Ab1371 in 2003 Strengthens informed consent requirements for mentally handicapped patients that take part in medical research
3730942	3737044	2004, AB 2412, allows part-time community college faculty to access unemployment benefits.
3737564	3740925	AB 3042, enhances sentences for child prostitution.
3742185	3749066	Let's see, 2006, AB 409, establishes tighter controls and higher health standards for nail salons.
3749987	3756068	AB 1207, adds sexual orientation to the list of protections in the Code of Fair Political Practices.
3756608	3762658	So, you know, he's not been all about, you know, take it or leave it, whether you, I don't know what there you agree with or what you don't agree with.
3762958	3771131	There's been other stuff to him than just this violent video game law, which I think, unfortunately, he's making a whole career defining thing out of.
3771852	3774894	Just a heads up, he is running for mayor of San Francisco.
3775054	3775915	You may or may not know.
3776335	3782759	San Francisco, the former mayor, Gavin Newsom, is now the lieutenant governor of California after the November elections.
3783699	3787902	So they have an interim mayor, and that means there's going to be a new mayor election this year.
3788002	3791584	So there are a handful of candidates in the ring, and Lee Lanee is one of them.
3791904	3793505	So there you go.
3793765	3797608	Possibly maybe violent video games will be banned in San Francisco.
3798388	3798769	Why not?
3798809	3802094	They're banning Happy Meal Toys and Circumcision, too, on top of everything else.
3802174	3802895	So why not?
3802935	3804657	We'll just throw violent video games in there.
3806660	3806921	Anyhow.
3808956	3809636	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3835891	3841134	I'm still trying to find this one article that was talking about the greatest cartoons for traumatizing children.
3842654	3843995	But how about we talk about Zynga?
3844976	3847677	Zynga has something... That's pretty traumatic for children.
3847937	3848417	Yes, it is.
3848918	3849938	It has something very new.
3850058	3854140	And I'm actually going to quote this article because I like the way it's laid out.
3854761	3855541	It's a new venture.
3855881	3859043	It's something different from Farmville and Frontierville.
3859783	3861164	So here's where the quote begins.
3861964	3863685	1.
3862064	3863685	It doesn't actually have VIL in the title.
3864645	3863685	2.
3864746	3866807	Players play with actual, totally real money.
3868047	3866807	3.
3868747	3870608	Players' companies won't necessarily grow.
3870708	3872749	In fact, it may shrink through no fault of their own.
3872849	3873670	Wait, wait.
3873830	3875231	Players play with real money?
3875591	3875931	Mm-hmm.
3876831	3880773	The company is Zynga, and it's not a game, but a stock offering.
3880793	3881333	They're going public.
3881513	3883014	Oh, I get it.
3883374	3883995	They're going public.
3885015	3890838	They are filling an S1 form and going to be publicly traded.
3892532	3893313	We can really fuck them now
3915652	3922757	Now with all this talk about the decline of people using Facebook, Google Plus is coming out and has people talking.
3922797	3925438	I mean, don't put it in the nail coffin of Facebook.
3925458	3927019	Assuming that they let people in.
3927280	3931582	But I'm just saying, there is this talk about Facebook might be slipping a little bit.
3931642	3934864	So is this the time for Zynga to say, trust in us?
3935545	3936485	Like, I really think...
3937506	3937987	Zynga's Profile
3952603	3953624	FarmVillain Facebook Games
3981552	3989899	That and a very neutered dog on their logo Doesn't that name have like a weird meaning to it too?
3989940	4007775	I can't remember like where the company name came from Something silly Islander says I didn't know Zynga was on Facebook I've just been playing on Myspace Ladies and gentlemen we have found the one person that is still on Myspace I thought it was Tom I thought it was Justin Timberlake but go to chat right now he's there
4008320	4010361	Zynga is the CEO's dog.
4010942	4012222	Oh, so that's why the logo's a dog.
4012242	4012843	That makes sense.
4013403	4014604	Alright, let's see.
4014784	4018586	By the way, we got a tweet about this tonight from Twitter user Nathan Jackson.
4019326	4021347	I would like you all to talk about Zynga going public.
4021427	4024809	Do you all think it would be sustainable with games like Farmville going down?
4026070	4028791	Kind of that same point I was just making, like things are declining.
4028852	4030833	So I think the only way Zynga can be...
4031943	4034204	I just hope to God it's not true that they tried to buy PopCap.
4034324	4036585	That would be, that would make me very sad if Zynga and PopCap merged.
4036625	4037065	Very sad.
4037085	4037205	Mm-hmm.
4058360	4059341	Alright, moving on.
4059381	4062743	Let's get to some other news stories and release dates soon.
4063123	4064684	Some more depressing news.
4065605	4066566	If you thought, you know...
4068044	4070225	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4097562	4110493	The bill states that 10 or more public performances by electronic means during any 180-day period of one or more copyrighted works will result in not more than five years of imprisonment.
4110933	4115777	So as long as the performance in question is valued at at least $2,500 U.S.
4115877	4121662	or the value of the license to legally perform its content is valued at $5,000 or more.
4124085	4124245	And, um...
4139125	4143568	Now they're saying right now it says if it manages to pass.
4144708	4160158	The homemade gameplay clips, which I've never heard of them called like this, but apparently referred to as Let's Play videos, fan-made music videos, a webcam, cover songs, anything I guess that involves music or video.
4160578	4164941	It could potentially cover cell phone videos of concerts and press events.
4166181	4166282	Um...
4167222	4177824	So yeah, basically, they're saying that this could apply to YouTube users and also sites that embed YouTube content as well.
4179525	4185586	And really, to get down to the bottom of it, I think they're going to have a hard time regulating this stuff.
4185626	4188887	I mean, if they're going to go after everything, then...
4190771	4191111	I don't know.
4191171	4193113	And this is only going to benefit what?
4193553	4205240	I understand that, you know, for example, if you take a song off an album and you put it as a YouTube video and you leave it there so people can listen or, you know, pirate that song, I understand that's bad.
4205721	4212125	If, for example, you know, you're... And I don't even know about so much the, you know, music videos and stuff.
4212145	4213946	I don't have a real big problem with that.
4214326	4215687	Especially gameplay videos.
4215827	4217548	I don't understand gameplay at all because...
4218989	4228995	It's not really the same as putting a movie up, like an actual cinematic movie and you're pirating or a TV show or something like that.
4230235	4232657	This law is absolute, total, utter bullshit.
4232877	4236619	And the problem with it is that it's just shittily written.
4237159	4238780	Is that a word I can use?
4238820	4239240	Shittily?
4239440	4239821	It can be.
4240181	4241482	Okay.
4241522	4242482	This law was shittily.
4242502	4244283	It's shite.
4244644	4245164	It's shite.
4245464	4246785	It is total, utter shite.
4247325	4251208	And the reason why it's shite, it's just badly written because it includes all this other stuff.
4251268	4252508	I get what they're trying to do.
4252909	4260833	What they're trying to do is they're trying to get at these websites where you can log in and you can stream movies that are in the theater.
4260873	4261794	You can stream them.
4262134	4263816	or current TV shows and all that.
4263856	4273446	That's what they're doing, but because they've left the door so wide fucking open, if somebody gets on there and tapes a karaoke performance and puts it up on YouTube, it could be subject to this law.
4273986	4278611	And you might be saying, well, that's not what they're trying to go after, but unfortunately when you have a shittily written law...
4279372	4280133	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4296835	4300739	The problem is this is also, it's just taking a big fat dump all over fair use.
4301520	4307827	Like I should be, yes, I should be able to upload video for the purpose of critiquing and commenting on it.
4308227	4312812	So you mean I'm going to have to contact the copyright owner to get express permission to do that?
4313152	4313853	Well, guess what?
4314014	4320804	All of your game review videos are going to be done by IGN, 1UP, GameSpot, and all the big companies.
4320844	4328495	Because Activision, all those times, they don't have the time for little pissants like you and me that they're going to sign off on the rights for that.
4328895	4332158	So say goodbye to independent media if something like this passes.
4332478	4332998	You know what?
4333019	4335240	Say goodbye to Orange Lounge Radio if this passes.
4335260	4340785	Because I'm telling you, if this bill in its current form passes and goes effective, I'm walking away from this show.
4341125	4346610	Because I am not going to go to jail because I like to play music over the classic game of the week.
4347631	4348932	for the purposes of critiquing it.
4349653	4350454	That is not a threat.
4350494	4351215	That is a promise.
4351295	4355300	If this law passes and is enforced, there will not be Orange Launch Radio anymore.
4355500	4355881	Period.
4356041	4356802	Well, I don't know.
4356842	4361467	Maybe Loki and DarkSakura will decide they want to do it, but somehow I don't think they want to subject themselves to that either.
4362389	4366413	Like, that is the seriousness of this bullshit law.
4367654	4369115	I get what they're trying to do.
4369215	4370496	They're not doing it right.
4370576	4379842	So you need to contact your senator, contact folks, and tell them that this law is a bad thing for America.
4381996	4388338	There actually is a site up there that will generate email to your local legislature.
4389598	4391539	So you do have a way of getting out.
4392319	4395420	Actually, I have relinked it on my Facebook.
4395480	4398261	And who is voting these goddamn people in the office?
4398321	4401141	I mean, seriously, all these Lenys and shit.
4401241	4405062	Oh, and he's going to become mayor now because he's such full of wonderful ideas?
4405182	4407303	Remember what I said about lazy Americans?
4409691	4415244	The fact that people won't get up and vote when these things come up.
4416728	4417831	Just sit back and bitch about it.
4417871	4419555	Sorry, you don't vote about it, you have no right to complain.
4420517	4427899	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, yesterday I was on JustinTV and I did a search for Transformers and sure enough people were streaming a bootleg of Transformers 3 in a foreign language.
4427939	4428379	Ha ha ha.
4428999	4435680	Well, then that needs to be worked out between JustinTV and the copyright owners of the work.
4436040	4442642	And JustinTV should take action thusly against those accounts of people doing it because I'm sure that is against their terms of service.
4443122	4445222	Like, that's the law you need.
4445442	4448383	Not sending me to jail because I want to sing...
4449283	4452885	I want to post a tape of Jessica and I singing Love Shack on the internet.
4452985	4455206	Actually, I would never post that tape on the internet, but she did.
4455446	4457487	And I don't want her to go to jail for that.
4457908	4461570	And on top of that, that would make certain games illegal.
4462110	4471174	Because I believe SingStar and stuff like that allows you to take songs and record videos to them and post them up on the internet.
4471214	4471515	Correct.
4471855	4475917	And also there's going to be a game like SingFor the Hits Edition that's
4476277	4478122	are going to have connectivity with YouTube as well.
4478403	4481050	So all those are basically felony makers.
4483228	4509411	unless of course those people that own those songs or you know own those video game companies and stuff like that don't stop these things from going because if no one complains then you know it's going to be alright Blackwolf in our chatroom says well to be fair I don't know if the guy who wrote this bill campaigned on this so they could have voted him in without knowing he was going to pen this specific bill and that's a true point you never know what politicians are going to do but we need to hold them accountable
4509811	4515634	And I plan to write my congresspeople and say, if you support this bill, I will not vote for you.
4516434	4517395	I will not vote for you.
4517555	4521857	What's it take to, say, for example, get these guys out of office?
4522357	4525118	Well, there's these elections that they have every few years.
4525138	4529380	Well, I understand that, but hey, we can— Recall, I guess.
4529460	4533202	That's what happened with how Governor Schwarzenegger got into office in the first place.
4536074	4537215	Remember the Governator?
4538495	4539376	That's where that all came from.
4539576	4541036	He terminated the other governor.
4541437	4542537	Didn't do shit.
4543137	4545778	Yeah, I think we ended up with the worst governor, but I don't want to make this show political.
4546579	4546999	So anyhow.
4548079	4548940	I'm too late for that.
4549720	4550921	I know, right?
4551021	4558364	Especially after last week where things got a little heated, I really didn't want to have a political show tonight, but we can't fucking get away from it.
4558424	4561025	It's all that's in the news this week is all this political stuff.
4562446	4562826	Yeah.
4565390	4566675	Let's make our own country.
4567157	4567418	It's Oelaria.
4571808	4578669	By the way, the senator that's behind this is Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota.
4579469	4580210	Minnesota.
4580370	4585010	There's a whole website, opencongress.org, that will show you who's in favor of it and who's against it.
4585070	4587451	Right now, 51 companies for it, 3 against.
4588771	4596772	I'm telling you, though, if it goes through, it's going to be yet another one of those laws that gets tied up because I would be fucking pissed because this just seems to violate fair use.
4596812	4597332	Like, really?
4597473	4599293	I can't film somebody at karaoke?
4600553	4601414	That is wrong.
4602494	4604175	How more ridiculous is this going to go?
4604215	4609037	On the bright side, American Idol will finally go off the air.
4609637	4612358	Say, for example, the Happy Birthday song.
4612418	4613419	Is that public domain?
4613679	4619702	Are people going to get sued because there's a song playing in the background of a YouTube video or something like that?
4620262	4621002	Wedding videos?
4624604	4625264	Well, you know.
4627381	4629182	Leland Yee, at least one quote.
4629362	4633444	He's talking about different stuff, pandering towards corporations.
4633564	4636005	I think this is one of those things that panders towards a corporation.
4636385	4646711	Not necessarily the one that you were quoting when he made that comment, but there are definitely a lot of bills and stuff that go towards these corporations that have these senators in their pockets.
4647791	4648071	I don't know.
4648272	4649653	It's not much of a surprise.
4649794	4653318	Just so you guys know, here's some of the organizations that are supporting this bill.
4653678	4666153	The Directors Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild, the Motion Picture Association of America, Recording Industry Association of America, NBCUniversal, Viacom, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Ultimate Fighting Championship...
4669396	4671778	Church Music Publishers Association.
4671838	4672599	Well, we're fucked.
4672639	4674180	Church Music Publishers Association.
4674220	4678885	It's all the RAA and MPAA and all the different movie studios because no one wants piracy.
4678965	4679586	But you know what?
4680847	4682368	I understand.
4682448	4684571	I have no problem with them fighting piracy.
4684891	4685712	I get the...
4687573	4690475	The reason this bill is going into place, I get it.
4691116	4692297	This bill doesn't cut it.
4692617	4700843	You need to close these loopholes in the bill before it's... What is going to stop every website in Canada and other countries?
4703025	4706288	This is another reason... I promised I wouldn't get political, but I can't.
4708489	4708609	China.
4708629	4708749	China.
4738146	4739850	I'd rather live in Taiwan
4748682	4751464	We can still stream it, you know, stream to Canada.
4751604	4753245	And I can play all the Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
4753265	4754565	We don't have to say where we're located.
4756066	4757227	We're in Canada.
4757927	4758748	And not in the U.S.
4758808	4762370	Yeah, I'm not Benji in our chatroom says, actually, happy birthday is copyrighted.
4762390	4762750	That's right.
4762770	4768393	So if you put up a YouTube singing happy birthday to someone, you're going to be, your ass is going to jail.
4768533	4770134	I would love to see that article.
4770354	4772055	Grandma goes, you know.
4774023	4777246	What happens if you do three different songs?
4777306	4781892	If you sing Happy Birthday and then a couple other karaoke songs, and that's three strikes.
4783273	4784194	No, that's not three strikes.
4784275	4787158	It's major violent felonies, I think, but...
4788960	4793521	DJ Morpheus in the chat room, our good buddy from Under Sedation Live, Saturday nights here at All Games.
4793841	4802563	But not to worry, this is going through Congress, so the public will have a voice and courts to fight it, unlike CARP, which was all secretly done behind closed doors.
4802703	4808024	Well, goddamn, sir, I hope you are right, because three words, this bill sucks.
4808745	4809945	Fucking sucks, four words.
4811525	4814726	And this is really more important than balancing a budget, right?
4817526	4821749	DarkTetsuya says, well, we're still waiting to see if Under Station Live will be banned in China.
4822449	4824770	It'll be a great little thing for the network.
4824930	4828773	It'll be like the show from China versus the show that can't be in China.
4828933	4829773	All on one network.
4829793	4833175	He said, AllGames.com will also have to move to China or Canada.
4833435	4836657	Where could AllGames.com go if this bill passes?
4836717	4839319	AllGames.com, what country would we put them in?
4839359	4840780	Where would Scott Rubin want to be?
4840880	4845503	They can go to... Where would Scott... Amsterdam.
4845523	4846003	Amsterdam.
4850187	4850687	Oh, shit.
4852268	4852808	I don't know.
4852828	4859251	There's football, but not... Well, then I guess they could do Canadian football in Canada.
4861252	4861552	All right.
4862013	4862593	Moving on.
4864130	4868553	This bill is taking far too much time on our show, but at the same time it is very important.
4868754	4871235	And so we just want to bring your attention to it.
4871275	4872176	I'm not fucking around.
4872196	4878341	If this bill passes, say goodbye to a lot of your favorite gaming press stuff.
4878541	4880462	This is bad for the gaming industry.
4881043	4882844	This is bad for the gaming industry.
4883064	4883885	And if they don't see it,
4884534	4889457	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4908286	4914550	Well, on Tuesday, I think was the day it was finally posted, they finally posted a response.
4914670	4916031	Fans have been waiting for this.
4916872	4923957	Quote, we never say never, but we can confirm that there are no plans to bring these three games to the Americas at this time.
4924997	4935391	The Twitter response thanked Operation Rainfall folks for being such incredible fans but said there continues to be no plans for Nintendo of America to release these three games right now.
4935812	4936393	So I see.
4936533	4940398	I haven't seen people rally for a Wii games release in a very long time.
4940438	4941640	Not since President Cat.
4942000	4942821	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4958619	4962440	So our little campaign was not forgotten, which I think is great.
4963061	4969323	And they actually said, the game is called President Cat, people, which made me laugh because the game actually wasn't called President Cat.
4969363	4972804	We kind of gave it that name because the translation was like Boss Cat.
4973164	4973664	And so I don't know.
4973684	4974325	It just kind of came out.
4974345	4975405	Let's call it President Cat.
4975925	4981367	Well, the definition of a sukeban is like a delinquent gang leader girl.
4983371	4992863	So, if you imagine a cat being like a delinquent gang leader who is also the president of the company Yes Then that's what it's like Gangbanger cat
4994824	4995664	That could be the sequel.
4997345	4997626	All right.
4999447	4999847	Jeez.
5000747	5008632	Anyhow, by the way, Xenoblade is still getting a localization for an English-speaking country, and then some.
5009372	5019518	There is a European localization in the works, and this is for Xenoblade Chronicles, and it was in an Iwata Asks interview that's a little video clip there.
5019998	5046950	and Xenoblade is coming out in Europe on September 2nd it's going to come out with a red classic controller pro in order to localize a game for Europe I think it's got to be in English, French, Spanish, German and I'm forgetting a language but like there's like five languages Swahili probably wait English, French, German, Spanish probably Italian that's like five different languages the game's got to be in to come out over there and they should just do it in Latin
5048291	5050252	It's not worth the money to put out here
5073647	5080111	To which I put, dot dot dot, instead we have some more Nintendo 64 games we'd like to port over and make zero changes and Zelda you get a premium.
5080651	5081251	Love, Nintendo.
5083212	5083713	Exactly.
5083813	5085854	Zelda Ocarina of Time in 3D?
5085954	5086634	Not a problem.
5086674	5087155	Xenoblade?
5087215	5087655	Fuck you.
5089756	5090356	That's what I'm hearing.
5090657	5092057	But hey, you know what though?
5092538	5095319	Nintendo's gonna be... You don't understand.
5095359	5097160	Here's how Nintendo's gonna fucking play this shit off.
5097440	5098901	Oh, we have no plans on doing that right now.
5099121	5099602	But come E3...
5100856	5126759	fans demanded it and Nintendo we hear you fans we're gonna bring it out for you because we're so gracious we're gonna bring them out to you it's basically you're gonna beg for it and then they're gonna say no and they're like ah well we're so gracious we're gonna bring it out to you so you know what when they do that don't fucking buy it tell them fuck you wait but why wouldn't you if they finally do decide to release the game isn't that what you wanted because it's the attitude that they're having with it
5128532	5153584	I don't know if I meet you all the way there like I don't disagree that something like that is very likely to happen but I had said before the show I said watch because Nintendo likes to kind of take games and redo them for new consoles like these will all be games on the Wii U and they'll be able to say that oh we're listening and we're oh these are games that the hardcore gamers want Last Story Plus Edition on the Wii U it's Last Story U and Xenoblade U
5154424	5158908	No, it's not going to be that at all, because that would take additional effort.
5160109	5161450	They're not going to put in additional effort.
5161490	5173181	I don't even understand what the point is, because they've had other games that they have translated into English and released only in Europe and Japan, and never brought the Europe version of the game over here, which...
5174540	5179446	I mean, I would think if you're spending the money to translate into English, why not release it?
5179506	5182450	Hell, you don't have to fucking advertise this thing very much.
5182490	5183331	Just put it out.
5183511	5185013	You will sell some copies of it.
5186877	5187377	Thanks for watching!
5213110	5229137	It's a bummer that it's the Wii because if this was the 360 and there was enough fan demand, we've seen now where that game, and I forget what it was, Death Smile or whatever it was, that Japanese shooter game that came out in Japan and they just said, you know what, we'll put it up as a download title.
5229177	5232038	We're not going to bother to translate it though, so fucking here it is.
5232318	5234019	Just take it if you want it.
5234319	5236080	But I think people are generally happy with that.
5236220	5238721	And now there are special box sets and everything.
5238741	5239021	Yeah.
5239441	5243843	So, unfortunately, it would be great if the Wii could support that, but it can't.
5244263	5251947	And on top of that... Maybe the punchline is the Wii U will, and these games will be downloadable on the Wii U. No, and here's the funny part about that.
5252087	5259091	On top of the fact that they won't even bring it over here, they give Europe a nice collector's edition with a controller and everything for them.
5259371	5263613	So, obviously, they know that the game's popular, but they just still don't give a fuck about you.
5264033	5290032	Rickster in our chatroom says why do that Nintendo has already put the Wii out to pasture and I think that's a good point is you know well they've already said the Wii U is coming so let the Wii die basically a slow death as we get our last little hurrah Zelda game people still own Wiis and people and this Wii U isn't coming out until the end of next year so what the fuck are they gonna put out is everybody planning on buying a Wii U day one no if I've learned one thing from Nintendo consoles no I'm not
5290712	5292533	I'm not planning on buying this thing day one.
5292813	5295394	I mean, unless there's that just kick-ass must-have game.
5295795	5296515	We'll wait and see.
5296775	5301837	I am a consumer whore, though, so I still may succumb to needing it early or something like that.
5301857	5302278	I know, I know.
5302638	5310602	It really, so far, hasn't... I mean, it's basically a Wii with better graphics and a stupid controller that I don't really give two shits about.
5311062	5311222	But...
5313055	5318481	But I'm just gonna like, well, just because, okay, like when the PlayStation 3 came out, the PlayStation 2 didn't just roll over and die.
5318581	5319542	No, it still hasn't.
5319562	5324788	God of War was still going, and the old systems don't just roll over and die.
5325369	5326590	So I think these games could keep it going.
5326731	5328673	Especially not the Wii, because you have to understand...
5329093	5335718	Just because everyone bought a Wii does not mean they're going to buy a Wii U. In fact, I think because you got all these old people and stuff like that to buy Wiis.
5336278	5339760	No, that is not going to translate into more Wii U sales.
5339820	5342922	Just because you can use these Wii games on there.
5343383	5344223	I mean, think about it.
5344263	5346905	It's like, Rob, I need to buy a Blu-ray player.
5346985	5349167	But hey, it's okay because I can still play my DVDs on it.
5349927	5353028	Well, why am I going to buy a new unit if I already have something to play DVDs?
5353068	5353888	It doesn't make any sense.
5354668	5355428	I gotta say this.
5355548	5362130	I'm not the only one that doesn't understand your perspective, Loki, of campaign to get the games out, and then when they come out, say fuck them because of their bad attitude.
5362490	5366831	Derek H in our chatroom says, Wait, so you'd be upset if they do what you want them to do?
5367211	5372432	That's like going to McDonald's, buying a Happy Meal, then throwing it on the ground yelling, Fuck you, Ronald McDonald!
5374232	5376373	The sad thing is I can see Loki doing that.
5377993	5379574	There isn't enough fucking bacon.
5380514	5393918	No, it's my problem is how else then do you teach a company like this that you're not going to fucking take their... Oh, well, you're going to just have to take Reggie and bend him over your knee and say you're being very, very naughty.
5393938	5399940	It's like fucking Konami with, well, if you really want this game to come out, you better have those pre-orders in.
5400260	5400460	I mean...
5400760	5401320	Fuck you!
5401360	5403341	I'm not buying your goddamn game then.
5403641	5410262	I don't give a shit if you put it out, because it will probably suck anyways, because all of your games, especially music games lately, have really blown.
5411083	5416984	I like doing the pre-orders to determine things, because that's how we got the low cost on the Macross box sets.
5417044	5419945	I like how the random ass DDR, we can never get away from that.
5420205	5420465	All right.
5420906	5422788	Well, no, it's because they pulled that bullshit.
5422988	5425510	Hey, Capcom, why don't you step up and do this bullshit?
5425530	5427672	Because, you know, this seems perfectly down your alley.
5427692	5428893	Is that what Nintendo should do?
5429074	5433398	Should Nintendo put it up on their website and say, okay, if 10,000 people order Xenoblade, then we'll put it out?
5434539	5437722	If that's what it's going to take for them to do it in time and matter, then fine.
5437762	5438343	Would you do it?
5438663	5440124	No, because I don't want to buy this fucking game.
5440665	5441666	I don't play the Wii anymore.
5442146	5442707	Who do I care?
5446049	5447370	Fuck you, Ronald McDonald!
5448410	5448730	No.
5449311	5452152	I would, seriously, I would boycott the game then.
5452252	5453412	Oh, you don't want to bring it out?
5453472	5453733	Fine.
5453753	5455754	You just want to put out some more Mario and Kirby games.
5456174	5464017	Kirby, which, by the way, I don't know if anyone still cares about Kirby, but... This is like the opposite of Operation Rainfall.
5464258	5466078	This is Operation Thunder Snow.
5466479	5467699	Yo, fuck those games!
5469961	5480896	I think you should start a campaign on Twitter Operation Thunder Snow Don't release those games In fact, don't buy Wii games P.S.
5480956	5481877	Fuck you, Ronald McDonald
5482136	5482636	No, seriously.
5482716	5483497	Okay, let's see.
5485338	5489841	Everyone's going to get fucking raging boner over goddamn Skyward Sword.
5489861	5493304	Ooh, it's a Zola game with stuff in it.
5494244	5498127	I got to say, though, the last story looked fucking great.
5498267	5500889	And I was looking forward to seeing that announcement E3.
5500969	5502090	And would I have bought that on the Wii?
5502570	5503771	Actually, yes, I think I would have.
5504774	5509937	I have one of those boners for Mistwalker that I kind of do for Q Entertainment.
5509997	5513340	Like, even their mediocre games, I will still support, like Blue Dragon.
5513360	5514941	Hey, Mistwalker, guess what?
5515141	5519504	Just because you had Nintendo publish your game in fucking Japan, you know what?
5519704	5521306	Other companies will fucking publish it over here.
5521326	5524508	You don't need to go through all this bullshit of having to beg a company to bring it out.
5524748	5525389	Because guess what?
5525429	5526970	There's companies like Ignition...
5527250	5527950	Thanks for watching!
5549358	5555662	Guilty Gear that you would never ever fucking play if you relied on Nintendo to bring that shit over.
5555682	5560564	Do you know how many decibels I've taken down your mic this episode and it's still not enough because you keep getting louder?
5561445	5563706	Sorry, I'm just saying that... You're just passionate.
5563946	5565587	I am seriously passionate about it.
5565667	5572871	The fact is I don't think that it should result in people begging a company like Nintendo to try to get them to understand the niche market.
5573132	5577434	You need companies that already understand the niche market and will bring this shit over regardless.
5577634	5582678	Let me ask this and then we can move on with more stories because we're an hour and a half into the show and haven't got to the end of part A yet.
5583359	5585681	What is your passion?
5587082	5587683	My passion?
5588543	5589724	As far as these games go?
5589845	5592026	Why do these stories get you so angry?
5592307	5601254	Because it's this whole, oh, we're this big company and we're just, you know, you should be gracious for everything they were putting out.
5601354	5605298	And they just don't, they think they understand what their users want and they don't.
5605578	5607199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
5628987	5653169	and we could bring this stuff over because we know we're doing the translation for Europe because hey they're a smaller market and I guess that makes it worth translating the game for it we could bring this over here with little effort whatsoever but no we're going to be assholes and say basically no we don't have any plans on doing this and yeah I know that you guys all rallied and really want this stuff over here and have committed to really going to buy this stuff
5653889	5656090	DJ Morpheus in our chatroom says Loki needs Prozac flavored bacon.
5676618	5678680	I really want bacon flavored like medicine.
5679801	5681102	That's disgusting.
5681142	5682103	Why would you want to flavor bacon?
5682123	5685526	I think you meant bacon flavored Prozac.
5686186	5687808	Sky, is Loki turning green yet?
5687948	5689629	Nope, still as white as you can believe.
5690530	5694353	Let's move on with another news story and then we'll get into the release dates.
5694453	5695234	DarkSakura.
5697556	5698337	Oh, Nintendo.
5699042	5719646	you've been a very quiet lady over there and usually you're the opinionated one so I've got to know what is your thought on all this mess like Nintendo not releasing these are they being hard-headed is does it make good business sense I say it's average for Nintendo this is just par for the course I'm used to this shit that this is why this is why you've just become desensitized to this
5720120	5720640	Pretty much.
5721741	5723942	It's basically people... And not like I play my Wii anymore.
5724123	5729026	Nintendo does something wrong, Loki yells and screams about it, lather, rinse, repeat for the past nine years.
5729046	5732788	It's basically people are... They're barking up the wrong tree.
5732868	5745256	They're asking Nintendo to bring over this really niche game when they should really be bugging these other publishers that put stuff out on the Wii as well as other systems to bring over the games because I think these people... Like, you know, like, Atlus.
5745436	5747857	There's another perfect example of a company that would do this.
5748117	5748277	They...
5749278	5750799	That's all they deal with is niche shit.
5750979	5751940	All right, we get it.
5752300	5753941	We need the return of working designs.
5756162	5760044	You know, actually, one of our pinball tables belongs to the owner of working designs.
5760724	5760985	Oh, really?
5761005	5761485	Our Twilight Zone.
5761525	5762105	That's kind of right, actually.
5762125	5763466	That's how we got our Goemon doll.
5764107	5766808	Nintendo plans on spending 16.5 billion yen on a new research and design facility in Kyoto.
5782413	5783854	Nikkei, Japanese Stock Market
5803917	5807879	They basically are trying to move everything into one house.
5808980	5814943	They are bringing in their R&D offices, all of the main staff.
5815723	5817624	Everything is going to be under one roof.
5819586	5826349	So, Loki, 16.5 billion yen on a new research and design facility, yet no last story.
5826789	5829231	What are your thoughts?
5830832	5832312	Well, they want to put everyone under one roof.
5832332	5833273	I don't see a problem with that.
5835010	5835851	Apple's doing the same thing.
5835871	5838153	They're building some giant space saucer thing.
5838173	5840896	Yeah, they're building a metal donut in the middle of San Jose.
5840916	5842257	Homework approved.
5842277	5846741	There's no square wall in the building or something like that.
5847021	5851125	They actually wanted to make a building that looks like Steve Jobs' asshole.
5851565	5853527	That's what they're building in the middle of San Jose.
5855208	5858471	So everybody can literally walk up his ass day in and day out.
5858571	5860053	And it's going to be all made of glass.
5862239	5863420	I can actually point out something.
5863460	5869402	There is a psychological reason that you want to remove hard edges is that it reduces the urge for violence.
5870523	5873404	Oh, because when I think of Apple products, I think of violence.
5873524	5874245	Loki, maybe.
5875045	5876286	Maybe it's to make happier workers.
5877646	5878407	Wow, really?
5878567	5884770	I know people that would kill someone, literally kill someone in the dead of night to get a job at Apple.
5885130	5887491	Like, I don't think of Apple as having angry workers.
5887631	5889172	I wouldn't do that.
5890212	5890412	No.
5890432	5890472	Um...
5894517	5900918	The whole, like, fact that, you know, it's been shown that circle buildings or whatever cause people not to be violent.
5901578	5904959	Sounds like the hippie mumbo jumbo that Steve Jobs would be spouting anyways.
5905839	5906399	But you know what?
5906460	5907620	Hectagons piss me off.
5908020	5911881	No, I think the whole thing is that he didn't like being called a square, you know?
5913801	5914521	So that's why.
5914801	5915201	So, ha!
5915301	5916422	You can't call me a square now.
5916602	5917502	You're a fucking idiot.
5917882	5918302	And a hippie.
5920540	5921620	We're going to plant some trees.
5921901	5923141	Go plant some trees, Steve.
5923541	5925022	Well, actually, we're going to plant a lot of trees.
5926042	5927623	Don't need the brew me right anymore.
5927723	5933585	I like how Loki had a wide open door to do more Nintendo bashing and he decided to take a pass.
5933965	5936286	What am I going to say about Nintendo opening a facility?
5936346	5937047	Good for them.
5937067	5938047	They're opening a building.
5938107	5941048	It's not like this facility is going to research more Mario games.
5941108	5943269	I mean, I don't know.
5943389	5945490	It's just they're consolidating their stuff.
5945670	5946871	Let me get you a little platter.
5947631	5949955	and I'm gonna hand you the joke on the platter, okay?
5950015	5951037	Here it is, here it is.
5951317	5958770	They're building a, they're putting all these billions of dollars into a research facility for all those new franchises they put out.
5958950	5959712	There you go, Loki.
5960626	5962727	It's not... Hey, you know what?
5963188	5967630	I don't believe they research shit for any of their franchises, so that's obviously not what it's for.
5967890	5971513	It's for their new consoles that are so innovative and different from their last console.
5971753	5975395	In fact, this new console, what, it has a tablet for a controller.
5975715	5978837	That's such a genius idea that they need a new research facility.
5978857	5981899	Clearly an idea like that only could have come out of a building shaved like a donut.
5984853	6000492	and basically quite a number of articles I just randomly found from anthropologists, different biologists, psychologists all pointing to the by the circle is a comforting and familiar shape to the mind on an unconscious level.
6001193	6006076	As well as in art, we study the golden mean as a curve.
6007256	6014040	So that it's like the shape of a shell, the circular shape of a shell.
6014760	6020863	Why a more circular face in some cultures is considered to be more attractive, they look for symmetry.
6022424	6024125	The hectagons are still very rude, right?
6024145	6024686	Yes, they are.
6026787	6029148	So for the record, they're actually a psychology behind it.
6030481	6031762	I don't believe in psychology.
6033243	6033924	That's clear.
6038407	6041349	There's that witty retort I've been waiting for DarkSakura all night.
6041789	6044051	Alright, let's move on to release dates.
6044391	6048955	We're going to travel the world and check out what's coming out to a store near you and eventually we'll get through this show.
6050136	6050496	Loki!
6051256	6058662	I'll save yourself some time because there's only one thing that's coming out this week that you really need to pick up and that would be Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.
6059102	6077650	and that's of course assuming that Earth Defense or assuming that they didn't release it on Saturday wherever you live because that was the case in fact since we're getting into it now I will explain why it's being released on Saturday because it's a funny story actually and it also goes to show you GameStop they're fucking assholes
6079192	6080052	Okay, so get this.
6080813	6085575	D3, they put out the game, they shipped it to stores or whatever like that early and stuff like that.
6085875	6092679	They misprinted the street date letter or the street date number or whatever on the master cases that went out.
6092919	6097901	So it said streets July 2nd, despite the fact that all their paperwork, the street date letters, etc.
6097941	6098562	say July 5th.
6099102	6102243	GameStop's going, no take-back Cs, no take-back Cs.
6102303	6103323	It fucking says the second.
6103343	6110265	We're putting it on the second on all systems, even though it was only the 360 MasterCases that they messed up on.
6110725	6117807	Instead of, you know, D3 saying, you know, hey, GameStop, you know, I understand that we did misprint that on there, but the street date is still the fifth.
6117847	6118527	Could you put it on the fifth?
6118547	6119847	They're like, fuck you.
6119907	6121928	We're putting it out whenever we goddamn feel like it.
6122048	6123448	And so that's kind of what happened.
6123588	6126269	Pinch, poke, yell me a coke, no take-back Cs.
6127049	6132390	It's basically now everybody's kind of putting it out because, well, GameStop's doing it.
6133011	6134791	And they advertised it on the website.
6134831	6136372	They called all their pre-order customers.
6136692	6138572	They're assholes.
6138952	6139692	But hey, you know what?
6140313	6142673	The benefit of it is that you get to play the game early.
6143053	6146274	And a lot of people are going to be putting it out as well other than GameStop early.
6146374	6151075	So bug killing on the 4th of July doesn't sound too bad.
6151115	6153376	So the moral of the story is D3, learn to type.
6154480	6163046	yes and that's coming out on PS3 and 360 this week and I kid you not that's literally the only thing that's coming out this week
6164690	6165451	Thanks for watching!
6187226	6197031	on the PlayStation 3 Angel Senki comes out as well as Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon Infamous 2 gets its Japanese release this week Just Cause 2 gets a price reduction Knight's Contract L.A.
6197091	6199292	Noire a game called R.U.S.E.
6199372	6208197	moves into the Ubisoft Best Collection and Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 also a Best Collection price reduction this week on the PS3 it's a busy week on the PlayStation 3
6209357	6238023	moving on to other consoles let's see if I can get to the Wii or the 3DS here my list oh my list is starting to show Vita releases but not till December over in Japan no hard dates yet I think those are all placeholders just so you know Sony PSP Suzumiya Haruhi-chan no Mahjong they're doing a Haruhi Mahjong game yeah look at that right there check that out and it's Mahjong
6240881	6241906	I don't know how to play Mahjong.
6241926	6242509	You should teach me.
6243132	6243936	You've never played Mahjong?
6244952	6248034	Okay, I played Shanghai on the old Macintosh.
6248054	6248894	I don't think that counts.
6249094	6250755	That's Mahjong Solitaire.
6251176	6252997	I'm talking about, like, for real Mahjong.
6253317	6253457	Oh.
6254398	6254658	Okay.
6254998	6255958	All right.
6256038	6258960	Tekken 6 gets a price reduction this week on the PSP.
6260321	6260721	Let's see.
6260781	6264503	The Nintendo Wii, a red Wii Remote Plus control.
6264543	6266324	That's all that's coming out on the Wii this week.
6266765	6268266	But 3DS gets a couple games.
6268746	6274109	Dr. Lotrek Tobuyaku no Kishidan comes out from Konami Games.
6274409	6279450	This is... It's Dr. Lorcan, I don't remember the fucking subtitle to it.
6280170	6282031	It's from Konami, it's coming out in September.
6282071	6283991	So it's not Professor Layton.
6284231	6287832	It's very similar to Professor Layton, but it's not.
6288132	6296314	Next week, by the way, in Japan, you can look forward to this, not this week, next week, the 14th, the Flare Red 3DS and Star Fox 64 are the big releases in Japan next week.
6297154	6297514	UK!
6299275	6299856	One thing.
6301096	6301737	Virtua Tennis 4.
6303178	6303598	On the 8th.
6304439	6305099	For PC.
6305739	6306019	That's it.
6306039	6306480	Oh, hooray.
6307080	6307700	I love tennis.
6308941	6309422	Moving on.
6309662	6311042	Who plays tennis on the PC?
6311123	6315605	Couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week.
6315645	6318647	And I'll tell you what, this week's classic game of the week is old.
6318667	6321649	No, really old, you guys.
6321709	6322229	Yeah, it is.
6322429	6322710	Alright.
6322730	6323030	Loki.
6323050	6323290	Loki.
6324885	6346936	Game for Windows well at least the marketplace is going to be no longer is actually merging with Xbox.com on July 11th and that's all you need to know I guess they tried to overhaul it back in November and no one cared so now it's going to be part of the Xbox marketplace
6348163	6348403	Awesome.
6348683	6350344	This actually kind of makes sense.
6350464	6369231	I mean, Games for Windows was having a hard time kind of finding its market, especially versus Steam, to merge all the gaming into one place and to really kind of homogenize, if you will, the Xbox gamer tag and the experience and all that, bringing that, you know, connect to PCs even and all that, kind of bringing that all together.
6370471	6372432	That all seems kind of smart for Microsoft.
6372472	6374173	So this seems logical.
6375453	6377454	So I guess there's really not a lot else to say on that.
6378755	6382239	It'll be interesting though what will happen with the Windows 8 integration.
6382399	6385522	That's what I'm most curious about because you know it'll somehow integrate into Windows 8.
6386103	6393391	And I'm really curious how Microsoft is going to tie together the 360 and Windows 8.
6393711	6398156	Now there's only so much they can do because they don't want to get... Well the new interface looks like Windows 8.
6398476	6400158	That's an optional interface, though.
6400178	6405764	That's one thing that they haven't been... That was one type of interface that you can have.
6405804	6408067	Windows will still have the traditional way of doing it.
6408087	6408587	Oh, wait, that's right.
6408788	6409909	Optional on Windows.
6410229	6410810	My mistake.
6412392	6413092	Required on 360.
6413132	6413172	So...
6415629	6417932	Well, it's just like, what is that thing called?
6417992	6420836	The multimedia Windows thing that you can do on the 360.
6421917	6422718	Windows Media Center.
6422898	6425041	Windows Live or whatever.
6425081	6428505	That was a lot of what was shown with Windows 7, but how many people really use that?
6428626	6429727	I can't use that in my house.
6429767	6430528	It's too damn slow.
6431129	6433572	So I don't know how many people use that, but there you go.
6434420	6437902	Alright, anyhow, one other story for you guys and then we'll get into the classic game of the week.
6438143	6440664	This is about a different classic game, GoldenEye.
6441285	6445848	A domain has been spotted for a game called GoldenEye Reloaded.
6446008	6447729	Not just one domain, a bunch of games.
6448350	6454074	Is it possible that last year's Wii game will be coming out on the 360 and PS3?
6454574	6456155	Could it maybe be getting a sequel?
6456676	6458657	Or could it just mean fucking nothing?
6458837	6463881	It could be any of the above, but that domain has been spotted and it indicates that GoldenEye
6464421	6468162	is not quite dead, even though the Wii version got kind of lukewarm reviews.
6468542	6472143	But what would happen if that game came out in HD on the 360 or PS3?
6472863	6475244	I would say that's actually kind of rad if that happens.
6475324	6487168	Well, someone had already done the translation to HD already, but it got kind of tied up with the whole rights being owned by... Yeah, but doesn't Activision pretty much solely own the James Bond stuff now?
6487888	6488188	Um...
6489108	6499005	Yeah, but I think that's why Goldeneye came out on the Wii and not on the other systems because the other James Bond games are terrible.
6500207	6502551	All right, let's go to the gaming vault.
6504332	6514018	and we're going to take a stroll down the gaming lane and find a classic video game in the vault that DarkSakura says, hey, you kids need to respect where your games come from.
6514058	6517720	You know, you wouldn't have Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.
6518120	6522422	You wouldn't have The Last Story or any of these games if it weren't for games such as this one.
6522783	6524504	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
6524824	6528126	This is a game that I played when I was five years old.
6528566	6530687	Wow, so this would have been like 50 years ago?
6530887	6531328	Shut up.
6531348	6531928	Just kidding.
6532830	6537373	It's called The Quest for the Rings, and it was on the Odyssey 2 and Video Pack.
6537753	6540675	Came out in 1981.
6540816	6542897	Let's listen to some of those bleeps and bloops.
6547020	6548021	Yep, that's the game sound.
6548041	6550622	That's when it's having you pick your class.
6551343	6556767	Let me get to somebody like... That's gonna hurt our listeners' ears, but there you go, it's in the background.
6557856	6558556	I love this game.
6558676	6568339	And keep in mind, I played this game actually for a few years, because when I moved next door to a couple other friends, they had an Odyssey 2.
6569219	6572660	So I got to play it again, and I loved the game even over the years.
6572720	6576422	But okay, Quest for the Rings basically was sort of...
6577882	6580563	It's what Gauntlet should have been based off of.
6581564	6588428	It was very Gauntlet-y, but this came out four years before Gauntlet existed.
6589928	6592530	It had a board game released with it.
6592610	6594991	It was a combination of a video game and a board game.
6595011	6596952	It came in this huge-ass box.
6597012	6598073	It was gorgeous.
6599493	6602095	You had one person who was the ringmaster.
6602615	6607858	So sort of like a combination between playing the D&D board game and playing Gauntlet.
6609799	6621665	So you could play the board game with the stuff that would go on in the quest mode, or you could actually just play the game in quest mode and play through the different levels.
6621685	6625447	This was the game that I was trying to remember the name of a few episodes ago.
6627188	6630030	So you had four classes that you could play as.
6630190	6631731	You could be a warrior.
6633212	6634813	He can kill stuff.
6635373	6640336	You could be a wizard who can stun other enemies.
6641116	6648460	You could also be a changeling who could turn invisible.
6648921	6652303	Except when the changeling was invisible, you couldn't see him either.
6653703	6670431	and then there was the phantom who could walk through all kinds of walls except for one kind and he did it at half speed which actually I would usually pick either the phantom or the changeling but the phantom was super convenient to have because there were levels later on where the walls would change location
6671730	6672911	It was super aggravating.
6673492	6675955	Okay, the gameplay video stopped because there was only about two minutes of it.
6676615	6679719	I found this related video that I'd seen before that's actually pretty funny.
6680079	6681981	This is how games were marketed back then.
6682001	6684344	I want to play the commercial for this game real quick.
6686909	6688110	Wizard of Odyssey?
6688270	6691531	Is the keyboard really the key to greater challenge in video games?
6691771	6692511	Of course it is.
6692611	6695012	You can play strategy games like Quest for the Rings.
6695272	6697133	Plan your strategy on the game board.
6697213	6699994	Use the keyboard to change heroes, enemies, places.
6700054	6700835	Be a wizard.
6700875	6703016	Outwit fiery dragons.
6703136	6704156	Take that dragon.
6704376	6705797	We wizards hate to lose.
6706097	6710759	The Master Strategy Series, only from Odyssey 2, where the keyboard is the key to greater challenge.
6711219	6711819	Buy Odyssey.
6712079	6715861	Get $82 worth of free games, including Quest for the Rings and Pickaxe Pete.
6717483	6720527	I had pick XP too.
6720547	6721148	$82 worth of games.
6721208	6722771	So that was $41 a piece.
6722811	6725715	So this game with its bleepy bloops, $41 in 19... What is this commercial?
6725735	6726757	1981, I think?
6726817	6727057	Yeah.
6727097	6727778	Was this commercial?
6731443	6733425	and that's... I mean, games were expensive.
6733825	6734906	Yeah.
6735306	6737027	It's interesting, too, that they used the keyboard.
6737087	6738669	It's really the niche for the Odyssey.
6738709	6740290	I guess just be competitive with the 2600.
6740550	6744853	Like, real gaming uses a keyboard, which is funny because that argument is still used today.
6745093	6754941	Well, the other thing with the Odyssey, too, is that it was also advertised as an educational system, too, because there were a number of educational games on it.
6754981	6759584	Like, one that we used to play all the time was CryptoQuip, where you put in a word...
6762346	6786765	We put in a word and then it scrambles it and we would always pick one person in our group that had to unscramble the word and so they'd have us face the wall except whenever it was me, I mean I was always really good at it anyway but the wall that they would have us face had a mirror on it and I've been able to read backwards since I've been able to read so it was never that difficult.
6787165	6789026	And this also was a system that had Casey Munchkin.
6790126	6793167	Or was it Munchkin or Crazy Chase that was the Pac-Man clone?
6793347	6795108	Casey Munchkin, I think it was called.
6795208	6796649	Which I've actually got a couple copies of.
6798249	6800290	But there was a cease and desist put on them.
6800790	6806652	So to find... I mean, it's not really super expensive, but to find a copy of Casey Munchkin is, you know, kind of a find.
6807233	6809293	So what made this game awesome to a five-year-old?
6810814	6813775	Well, it was just that you could, you know, you could fight a dragon.
6814195	6816236	But the dragon, you know, you couldn't kill the dragon.
6817405	6818766	and it was just an adventure game.
6818786	6820327	Like, look how awesome the dragon looked.
6820807	6821948	The big green blip.
6822608	6824089	That was serious graphics.
6824349	6825069	It's Godzilla.
6825890	6835435	I'm going to show everybody what this picture looks like because, I mean, seriously, that was pretty hardcore awesome graphics for, you know, when I was five.
6836756	6839719	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6839779	6840419	Oh, I'm sorry, there's more?
6840800	6841180	Yes.
6841320	6842341	Oh, you sounded like we were done.
6842361	6843041	All right, then what else?
6843742	6846284	Well, I was going to tell you about the other things that were in the game.
6846364	6847265	Oh, okay, well, please do.
6847665	6849006	Well, then let me restart the music.
6850027	6854251	You had five kinds of monsters, and they had the most awesome names.
6855111	6857113	There were orcs and fire wraiths.
6858294	6861799	who were really... They actually looked just alike, except they were different colors.
6861899	6862861	One was pink, one was blue.
6863321	6869089	Then you had dragons, which they basically moved left and right across the screen, but if you got in their way, they'd be like, and run at you.
6869850	6871152	And you'd be like, oh shit, it's a dragon.
6872314	6873575	And there was...
6875618	6891744	The Nightmares, by Droth Tarantulas, and Doomed Wing Bloodthirst, which makes me think that the designers of WoW played this game and took inspiration from the characters in the game.
6893556	6898438	But, I mean, I always... This is one game that I seriously thought they should totally remake.
6899358	6906000	Because... It was just... The theory behind it was so awesome.
6906540	6907320	It really was.
6908781	6910881	It was simple, simple gameplay.
6912402	6921705	But it did it so effectively that I don't think any other game has been, you know... If I'm looking back to this as one of my favorite classic games ever...
6923686	6926549	Then, you know, it's got to have something, say something for its staying power.
6927349	6932054	But I'll go ahead and actually link what the cover looked like in the chat room.
6932154	6934036	Because it had a really epic 80s cover.
6934056	6936458	Because, man, that's when people actually juice shit by hand.
6937790	6938250	All right, I'm done.
6939171	6942433	Classic game of the week, the quest for the rings for the Odyssey 2.
6943314	6944034	Damn, that's old.
6944475	6948858	All right, we're going to take a break here, but don't worry, there's plenty more of Orange Lawns ready to come.
6948898	6950879	Thank God there's no work tomorrow.
6951560	6951920	Fear!
6952560	6954422	So, yep, we can stay up late a little bit.
6954442	6954942	Pinkberry run.
6955943	6956944	Pinkberry closes at 10.
6956984	6958064	We're not going to be done by 10.
6958365	6959425	I hate to break it to you.
6959625	6960666	I'll send the husband to go get it.
6961207	6962668	Now that I can buy into.
6963408	6965089	Alright, we gotta take a break though.
6965269	6968210	When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
6968250	6977394	We're gonna talk about Portal 2, we're gonna talk Minecraft, we're gonna talk DDR again, so Mal's making his way into the show, PSP remasters, and plenty more when we come back.
6977514	6980255	Your Twitter topics as well, twitter.com slash OLR.
6980655	6985897	Get those in in the next few minutes so we can talk about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

7037272	7038113	Why did I say Ice Tunes?
7039254	7040575	You were thinking of vanilla ice.
7040855	7042637	No, maybe this lovely cup of ice water I have.
7042657	7043858	In that case, you should stop.

7055567	7070718	while you're out shopping for podcasts might I recommend one of our other Orange Lounge production shows I guess you could say The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth www.hordehouse.com it's a show about the world of Warcraft and it's myself and Extifer
7071298	7097540	Doing lulzy Warcraft chat And this week was a real fun show We talked a lot There was a brand new patch in WoW this week 4.2 And also huge news about Warcraft It didn't make this show roll Probably because I already talked about it on Horde House But WoW has gone free to play in some ways Until level 20 Basically what existed as the free trial before Is now an unlimited trial It's not capped to 14 days So you can play all the way to level 20
7098260	7099160	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7120285	7141401	which we actually got into a discussion about we really wish that there was some way that we could cross zones in play because you can't play on... Oh yeah, it's one of the biggest drawbacks of WoW is that there's no way for us to roll on Europe and they can't roll on us unless you actually buy that region's copy of the freaking game and do it that way and it's kind of a pain in the ass.
7141441	7142262	Yeah, it's butt-hearted.
7143423	7149668	But the host over there still, we're good net friends because she's been on Horde House a couple times now and always brings the lulz.
7150288	7151590	But I signed up on their forums.
7151650	7152271	They're fun people.
7153472	7156316	And we had a really, really good time.
7156376	7157537	Really long discussion.
7158959	7161662	I hope to go back again.
7162623	7164445	Prospects seem hopeful.
7164846	7166308	And they were just great people.
7166408	7166949	All three of them.
7167249	7168631	I really enjoyed the time I had.
7169972	7172435	Don't you just love EJ's accent?
7172735	7172936	Yes.
7172956	7174037	I love her accent.
7174938	7175198	Love it.
7175579	7177461	Just want to put it in a little voice box and open it.
7178001	7178923	The haters are going to hate.
7179403	7182607	She says, fuck all, better than anyone I've ever heard.
7183911	7191182	Okay, by the way, we got a tweet from the Girls Gone Wow show on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR is our Twitter and GGW show is theirs.
7191803	7194106	I loved having DarkSakura on our podcast.
7194227	7195348	She was an amazing guest.
7195508	7197952	I'm in your show kidnapping your host.
7198092	7198413	Kisses.
7200015	7200295	Okay.
7201776	7202616	Hey, no.
7203216	7203937	You're here first.
7203977	7206158	Clone, clone, clone, clone, clone.
7207438	7208139	No, I think that's great.
7209059	7212801	Also, since I said it on Bobby's show tonight, I guess we could say it here.
7213441	7217963	There is a third podcast in the works.
7218363	7218803	Yes, there is.
7218823	7221845	And we're looking at taping the pilot in the next week or so.
7222625	7224726	And I'm hoping we'll have more information soon.
7225046	7225786	But that's all you get.
7226867	7227587	I can say one thing.
7227747	7228067	What's that?
7228328	7229188	It will involve a Dan.
7230396	7231216	Okay, we can say that.
7231296	7232197	Yep, it will involve Dan.
7232277	7232977	It will involve Dan.
7233117	7234818	So we are going to leave it at that.
7234838	7235218	I said A-Dan.
7235779	7235979	A-Dan.
7235999	7236859	I did not say which Dan.
7238000	7238820	It will involve a Dan.
7239240	7239541	All right.
7242062	7244263	Let's get into some rapid fire news.
7244683	7253027	Let's go to the news that there's lots of news this week and some of it we just don't have time to talk 15 minutes about like we did some of those Nintendo stories tonight.
7253447	7254448	Loki, why don't you start us off?
7255161	7256983	Yes, this is kind of neat.
7257423	7267573	Kotaku, I don't know if they've been doing the actual translations themselves, but they've been running on their website every Thursday starting a couple weeks ago.
7270382	7272725	Localized versions of Retro Game Master.
7272905	7286020	Now, for those who haven't heard of Retro Game Master, it's a show in Japan that has this game master who plays through old classic games, and there's kind of commentary going along with it, so...
7286320	7289302	So it's like the same thing I see on billions of YouTube channels and JustinTVs.
7289322	7290763	Kind of like that, but it's funny.
7291984	7294105	He has trouble with some of the games, and it's his commentary.
7294185	7295626	Professionally written, I guess?
7296107	7296547	I guess.
7296707	7297047	I don't know.
7298348	7303732	So the first episode was Ninja Gaiden, and then, of course, this week's episode was Super Fantasy Zone.
7304172	7305193	But you can check them out.
7305213	7310816	They're streaming, like I said, every Thursday on their Thursday at 8 p.m.
7310977	7314259	Eastern is when they have the thing going.
7314479	7315399	So check it out.
7316701	7320245	This is the type of stuff that should have been on G4 back in the day when they talked about games.
7320265	7323649	That was the Portal 2 information.
7324009	7330998	Portal 2... Sorry, I was talking to our chatters who now of course are asking a ton of questions on that little tease about the other podcast.
7331518	7331598	Um...
7333059	7336040	They teamed up with Kotaku to put the episodes out?
7336220	7336420	Yes.
7336500	7337280	That's interesting.
7337320	7338820	I mean, I'm not knocking Kotaku.
7338860	7340101	It's a fine website, what have you.
7340121	7340801	But it's just interesting.
7340861	7348963	It's not like a big Hulu or Netflix or even YouTube.
7349043	7351563	It's a very kind of niche gaming site.
7351723	7353984	I mean, it's one of the bigger gaming blogs, certainly.
7354044	7355864	But it's just an interesting path.
7355904	7358705	Like, I don't think of Kotaku television very often.
7358765	7360165	So it's interesting for them.
7360505	7360645	Yeah.
7362040	7363221	Portal 2 Patent Pending
7379197	7381820	I'm also another called Infinifling.
7382960	7385983	I was, I guess, focusing on mid-air portaling techniques.
7386303	7387004	That was second.
7387064	7393129	And then Endifice, which is based on some destroyed aperture chambers, picked up an honorable mention.
7393489	7398794	Now, all these are available to download at, of course, the portal website, thinkwithportals.com.
7400935	7425773	and many other user created levels so if you've played through Portal 2 already on PC and you want to go back and try some custom maps and stuff you can go and download these and it's really easy to access them in game so I haven't really played around with this yet but I always thought if this came out it would kind of all be integrated into Steam but it's not like I have to go to this website and do like I don't have to hack my game per se right but don't I have to have this dev mode or something
7426112	7426653	No, not really.
7426673	7433824	You just pull up the console in the game by hitting the title key and then there's a simple command you put in there.
7435327	7436068	Okay, well that's cool.
7439932	7446695	It'd be kind of cool if they integrated it with some sort of option in a menu or something like that where you can just select a map and play it.
7447416	7451638	Or maybe make multiple maps or something like that so you can have your own single player campaigns.
7452558	7456100	And of course, obviously, not something that you're going to be able to play on consoles.
7456881	7459743	And then finally, Left 4 Dead 2.
7461964	7464085	Apparently they had a little Easter egg in there.
7464525	7471089	There was a community-made campaign called Suicide Blitz 2 in Left 4 Dead 2.
7471849	7476211	And it's one of the officially featured fan-created add-ons for the game.
7476932	7480294	And it has a very neat Portal 2 Easter egg buried in it.
7480854	7481914	Apparently if you...
7484966	7491211	You find a portal, I guess, into the actual Aperture Science.
7493252	7505600	You can, I guess, find the Aperture Science and also Companion Cube, Propression Gel, Special Infected Zombies, and all sorts of neat stuff.
7505740	7506661	I was watching the video.
7506681	7509803	There was a video attached to the story that had two giggling girls playing the game.
7510804	7514766	It looked really well done from what I was watching.
7515967	7519710	It looked like you were freaking playing Portal but inside Left 4 Dead.
7520190	7522531	I like those wacky, zany crossovers.
7523192	7524893	Yes, and I like how you have to find a gnome.
7525874	7526054	Yes.
7528163	7529324	Street Fighter 4, the ports keep on coming
7546677	7547939	Volt, it's now available.
7547959	7549100	It's not something you have to wait for.
7549120	7552564	It was announced at a Capcom event in Tokyo, but it's available now.
7552865	7554647	There are three new fighters available.
7555027	7556989	Balrog, Vega, and Cody.
7557069	7560914	Keep in mind that when Street Fighter 4 was ported to the iPhone, not all the fighters from the
7561314	7562054	Thank you for watching!
7587425	7587825	You can do it.
7589366	7590707	That's Street Fighter IV Volt.
7591307	7595909	Also, in retro gaming's getting upgrades, Boulder Dash.
7595949	7597249	You remember this game, Boulder Dash?
7597409	7601651	I remember this because this was huge on the Commodore 64, was the series Boulder Dash.
7601671	7609334	And I think a lot of the old PC, not PC, sorry, old computing platforms like the Apples and so forth, this game saw some type of port on it.
7609374	7610575	These games were huge back in the 80s.
7611235	7613236	Well, it's getting a remake, I guess you could say.
7613276	7614577	It's an HD update.
7614657	7617758	It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon, July 13th.
7618699	7621840	It will be just shy of the Summer Arcade promotion.
7621920	7623761	Unfortunately, it's going to be going up against Ms.
7623881	7627463	Splosion Man, so it might fall through the cracks a little bit.
7627523	7634126	But if you're fond of the old game on the 64 or whatever computer back in the day, Boulder Dash XL is on its way.
7634826	7660418	it will have 7 times the amount of caves as the original 1984 version it's coming out from Calypso Media there will be a new puzzle mode with items like speed enhancers and telescoping arms, online leaderboards it will set you back 800 Microsoft points there will also be a PC version late in the summer if you are a personal computing purist and you don't want to play the game on one of those evil consoles
7661718	7662319	Thank you for watching!
7676664	7677504	Thank you for watching!
7693292	7705757	This all coming out from an interview with Zelda longtime producer Eiji Onuma, who said, so when we show a graphic demo, people think, oh, this is what the next Zelda will look like, but that's not necessarily the case.
7706457	7710758	And they also cite, again, the Wind Waker GameCube comparison there.
7711179	7714740	So confirmed, we use Zelda to be cel-shaded, right?
7715620	7716681	Okay, maybe not quite.
7717861	7718981	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7719662	7720222	Broadband!
7722659	7723760	New download content!
7724821	7734390	It will be For What It's Worth by Buffalo Springfield, Man on the Moon by R.E.M., Aerials by System of the Down, Hypnotized by System of the Down, and Turning Japanese by The Vapors.
7735491	7744379	And for Aerials and Turning Japanese and For What It's Worth, there will be pro guitar bass expansions available for another 80 Microsoft points.
7745512	7745852	Yay.
7746892	7751054	And next up, Final Fantasy Tactics for the iOS is delayed.
7751574	7753914	That's according to Sequenix's Facebook page.
7754274	7761557	It needs a little bit more time, so it's going to be in late July instead of June, as they said it would.
7761657	7762917	I think that might be a little old.
7764466	7767368	You have to have the bare minimum of an iPhone 3GS to play it.
7768169	7772332	And this is the remake of the PlayStation 1 version, so it's the good one.
7773372	7776775	And then, last but not least, oh, you addict people.
7777475	7778196	Minecraft!
7778596	7782759	They passed 10 million registered users.
7784120	7787482	and that's according to Marcus Persson's blog.
7788383	7791165	So they are now officially at 10,005,304.
7792646	7799190	The people who've actually bought it are in the 2 million range.
7800511	7801492	That's still pretty good.
7801812	7803093	2 million copies of the game.
7803333	7804634	One out of every five are buying it.
7805495	7805955	That's not bad.
7807611	7814382	But they say that basically they're getting 42,000 new players registering in the last 24 hours.
7815664	7816987	Can I take my registration back?
7817547	7818028	Just kidding.
7818088	7819931	I'm not that big a jerk, I promise.
7821636	7822637	Well, yay for Minecraft.
7822657	7823737	And yay for our Twitter.
7823817	7828020	Every week you guys send us tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
7828220	7830261	And we read some of your tweets here live on air.
7831262	7832723	Not a lot of tweets tonight, actually.
7832763	7835565	There's like not a lot of Twitter news tonight.
7836385	7848073	MNZiba says this tweet saying, Xenoblade or Monado, beginning of the world, is actually number three on the best sellers in Nintendo Wii action games list at Amazon.com.
7848973	7851675	and she gives us a link here to Amazon.com bestsellers.
7852236	7854257	It's actually up to number two now, just so you know.
7855478	7866826	Super Smash Brothers Brawl is the game that's beating it and it in turn is beating, Monado is beating Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Lego Star Wars.
7868112	7869073	So, interesting.
7869253	7873256	I mean, granted, keep in mind, we are looking at just the action game list.
7873356	7875078	I want to see where it ranks overall.
7875918	7879781	I'm looking at the overall list, and it's number 16.
7881583	7892411	That's still not bad overall, but just so you know, overall, Monado is being beat by a Wii Nunchuck controller in black and the HD component cable, which is number 8.
7895366	7902588	Another tweet to us from TigerClaw sends us a tweet saying, Space station internet too slow for online video games.
7905028	7907409	Let's see, it links us to a Kotaku article here.
7907769	7910029	Regarding life in space, everyone has three questions.
7910069	7910749	How do you poop?
7910789	7911570	Has anyone screwed?
7911610	7913110	And can you play video games up there?
7913810	7914890	They poop in a vacuum tube.
7915710	7916051	It's true.
7916171	7918711	DarkSakura would know the answer to that.
7919111	7922432	Anyhow, a Canadian astronaut, I didn't know they had astronauts in Canada.
7924878	7926179	Canadians in Space.
7927020	7928041	That'd be a great sitcom.
7928701	7937688	Anyhow, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield said that the internet connection aboard the International Space Station is simply too slow for games.
7938089	7940831	He compared it to a 56K dial-up modem.
7941251	7945735	But I guess the reason why it stinks is because of the space station's orbital velocity speed.
7946175	7949038	That thing moves at five miles per second.
7949598	7951260	Because keep in mind, it's orbiting the Earth.
7952561	7959266	Hadfield was the first Canadian to walk in space, and he's in line anyway to become the first Canadian commander of the space station.
7959746	7961047	And clearly he must be a gamer.
7961888	7966211	This all came out during a Canada Day event in Edmonton, so thank you for the link, Tigerclaw.
7967192	7968833	Blinder says this is a tweet.
7969453	7974297	Blinder222, to be specific, on Twitter, says, Did any of you play the Uncharted 3 beta?
7975899	7976079	No.
7976159	7976199	No.
7976219	7976299	No.
7991776	7992116	I think.
7992497	7995799	I mean, I'm assuming because it appeared on my... Just fucking download it if you're going to get it.
7995819	7996859	The servers are fine now.
7996919	8009427	No, it appeared on my download list now, but it's just... I have my PlayStation up in the front room and I have to drag an Ethernet cable because remember, old-ass PlayStation, no Wi-Fi built in because it's a 20 gig.
8010208	8013910	So I have to put an Ethernet cable, drag it into the front room and
8015580	8016161	See you last night.
8016181	8018645	I want to play Earth Defense Force online as well.
8018685	8023552	And yeah, I can do that with my console, but for some reason I wanted to plug it in.
8025672	8032257	Anyhow, I'm going to check it out hopefully in the next week But I tell you guys, I have a backlog of games to play I still have Loki's L.A.
8032297	8049110	Noire I haven't even touched yet And I have two racing games that I have for my rental service And I have touched none of it Because I've been playing this new Warcraft patch I've been playing the other games I've been talking about And Final Fantasy XIII I'm up to 30 hours in Final Fantasy XIII Rob, are your racing games PS3?
8049190	8049530	Any of them?
8049810	8051911	They're Xbox 360, but they're from my rental service.
8052172	8053212	Oh, I was gonna save.
8054453	8056835	We've got, like, a huge driving setup for PS3.
8057215	8057615	Oh, fine.
8057995	8058296	Nah, it's 360.
8059870	8065492	Test Drive Unlimited 2, and one of the Need for Speed games.
8065672	8066652	Shift 2 Unleashed?
8067592	8068853	Or is it Hot Pursuit?
8068873	8069733	I think it's Hot Pursuit.
8069873	8070973	I have to look.
8071174	8071654	I don't remember.
8074174	8077335	Isn't Hot Pursuit the one they just announced that isn't even out yet?
8077455	8080036	No, Hot Pursuit is the one that came out last year.
8080076	8081737	That one looks badass, I gotta say.
8081817	8083157	That new one looks fucking rad.
8083878	8086322	Hot Pursuit is the one that came out back in November.
8086422	8090008	Shift to Unleashed was the one that's sort of like Project Gotham that came out back in March.
8090849	8093253	And then, yeah, The Run is the one that's coming out later on.
8093616	8097579	So yes, at some point I will get to Uncharted 3 before they close the beta.
8097839	8105365	I actually have a pretty big gaming queue right now of stuff I want to play, and I'm still trying to beat Final Fantasy XIII, which is just, I'm so into it right now.
8105485	8106666	And it's spreading.
8106686	8109448	Did you see Bobby Blackwolf, our guy before us here?
8109468	8110528	I should finish mine.
8110789	8112170	He posted a tweet last night.
8112210	8113130	He said, you know what?
8114151	8116212	After a year, it's time for me to beat Chapter 10.
8116912	8119233	Which is funny, because I didn't struggle on that same boss fight.
8119273	8121654	There were boss fights I struggled on, but not that one.
8122294	8126916	There were some Eidolon fights that made me want to just... I'll have Sazh's Eidolon.
8129137	8131198	Oh my god, I went crazy on that fight, just so you know.
8132038	8133119	I have to find my save.
8133159	8136600	It's on one of the hard drives I have, because I've swapped hard drives around.
8136960	8140602	I know it's not on that console, because that's the internal hard drive.
8140942	8143143	But I have to track it down, and once I do, then I'll play it.
8145046	8147007	Alright, let's move on.
8147767	8151669	Another tweet, last tweet here from TigerClaw305 on Twitter.
8152470	8155671	Professor Layton Movie is getting a US release.
8156172	8159253	And, oh, I hate these websites that have ads you have to click through.
8160234	8160574	Let's see.
8162475	8163135	See how they do that, Nintendo?
8163155	8167316	They release something that's English language and release it in British markets, isn't it?
8185680	8190565	they can come over here without any effort whatsoever because it's already translated into English.
8191046	8198653	As revealed at Anime Expo 2011 this weekend the feature length animated film is on its way to North America reports Anime Your Way.
8199234	8204780	It was actually fairly well received and the developer Level 5 has already commissioned a sequel and would like a new movie out annually.
8205000	8212826	And I'd like to add also, seeing as we're talking about anime movies coming out soon, they announced a Trigun movie coming out, and that's awesome.
8212846	8214227	The trailer, did you watch it?
8214307	8214768	Yes, I did.
8215208	8215588	So nice.
8216489	8220852	It will take place, obviously, during the series, for obvious reasons.
8224875	8225716	But that is very exciting.
8226021	8227362	Alright, that's it for Twitter topics tonight.
8227382	8228662	Let's get back to some other gaming news.
8228722	8229002	Loki.
8229282	8233664	Alright, let's talk a little bit about Minecraft since we were just talking about Minecraft not too long ago.
8234404	8240126	Minecraft 1.7 is out now and it adds pistons and deadly sheep.
8240146	8242067	Because, you know.
8243610	8244310	Black Sheep, Pistons, Minecraft
8261858	8267283	Update 1.8 has been delayed a little bit by a week.
8267903	8271606	And 1.8 would add the Minecraft Adventure mode.
8272607	8274468	And that'll be coming very soon.
8274548	8279132	Apparently, 1.8 is released in the next few months.
8279733	8285337	And they're saying that they're also starting the crunch for the full release, which is going to be on 11.11.11.
8285377	8285417	So...
8289349	8289929	Yeah, neat.
8290190	8301977	And the adventure mode, I believe, was where you can actually create your own... I know that they've added maps recently, but maybe you can make your own Zelda-type game or something.
8302938	8303538	Should be kind of neat.
8305420	8306921	Definitely adding a lot more stuff to this.
8306941	8309322	At some point, I'll have to check it out.
8310143	8310583	Just not yet.
8312589	8319153	Alright, DDR News, DarkToagag wants to know, before I get to DDR News, does Loki have Minecraft?
8319334	8321575	That's from our chatroom.
8322316	8324237	I have it on my iPod, actually.
8324737	8325498	Oh, that's interesting.
8325778	8331282	Because, you know, that one Minecraft app or whatever that came out and they got pulled immediately?
8332022	8333183	Yeah, I found it.
8333583	8337786	So, I have that, but I haven't really, I mean, trying to use it on an iPod is just...
8339167	8344974	that's retarded no I haven't really played it yet I thought I had downloaded it at one point but I guess not
8346761	8350763	Dance Dance Revolution X3 vs. Dance Dance Revolution 2nd Mix
8371314	8381968	There will be a second mix mode in the game where you can play the full version of Dance Dance Revolution second mix including all the licensed music that appeared in that game.
8382725	8383245	E-Amusement Capability
8402077	8405399	Of course, X3 is really the highlight, and that's the game they want you to play.
8406760	8423130	480 tracks in total, standard DDR music, mix, songs, let's see, a variety of Bomani artists, transplant songs from other Bomani series, eAmusementGate, a community-oriented website for Konami games that allows players to form groups, share scores, and interact with other players.
8423150	8424391	That actually sounds kind of cool.
8425972	8427253	Will it make an arcade here?
8427433	8427913	I don't know.
8428113	8429815	Could it get a home release that good?
8429935	8430275	Doubt it.
8431618	8434260	See, that's the... Why can't I get that as a home release?
8434320	8454517	See, this is what pisses us off so much, is like, they put all this effort into DDR for the arcade, which, you know, we would love to believe that the arcade is still, you know, a viable place to have these type of games, but at the same time, they can't just strictly port this to the home console.
8454897	8456879	Whatever happened with the problem being...
8458039	8463760	You know, back in the PlayStation 1 days, just take the arcade release, you bring it home, and you add a couple things.
8464001	8464341	Done.
8464821	8465261	That's it.
8465701	8466341	People loved it.
8466821	8468021	Why do you gotta change it up now?
8468842	8469642	I don't understand the point.
8472202	8478304	Oh, it's because probably licensing 480 songs for home would be a little bit expensive, I guess.
8479064	8479324	I don't know.
8481585	8484968	Alright, well, I'm curious about this whole second mix.
8484988	8491613	I mean, second mix, just to put it in perspective for those that haven't followed DDR like we have, it's like 11 years old.
8491673	8494215	That was the first one I owned, was second mix on Dreamcast.
8494255	8497198	Yeah, so it's weird that they're kind of going back to that.
8497258	8501821	I mean, dude, I wonder if second mix will have, what was that fucking mode that's only in second mix, Jamie?
8501841	8503082	It was like your favorite fucking mode.
8503162	8503623	Oh, shit.
8503843	8504343	Dance battle.
8504524	8505104	Dance battle.
8505244	8506065	Maybe that'll come back.
8506445	8506665	Yeah.
8506685	8507486	That would actually be kind of rad.
8507506	8508767	Dance Battle was awesome.
8508787	8514090	Dance Battle's the one where you would have a measure where you could just make up your own steps, and then the other player had to do them.
8514531	8514771	Yeah.
8514871	8518373	So you could just... But you could only have, like, two things at any beat at a time.
8518673	8523016	Yeah, I mean, you couldn't go too shit crazy, but they would have to do whatever you just did.
8523657	8526219	But we used to just try to fuck each other's day.
8526699	8529621	And also, on top of that, there was no vivid.
8530542	8532103	It was all flat.
8533103	8533644	Ooh.
8533664	8533724	Ooh.
8534875	8535335	Thanks for watching!
8560038	8562742	I'm really curious to see how this translates in the arcades, but we'll see.
8562962	8564044	They'll fuck it up somehow.
8564985	8566347	Prove me wrong, Konami, I dare you.
8566407	8570593	You should play Strictly Businesses or Transfer Music after birth.
8570913	8571775	Remind me after the show.
8572015	8572636	Alright, moving on.
8575583	8576284	DarkSakura, right?
8576744	8577104	Oh, yes.
8577304	8577565	Sorry.
8578265	8579526	Stop playing on Facebook.
8579546	8580526	We're trying to do a show.
8580847	8581427	Nah.
8581727	8584249	By the way, can I say something that's pissing me off about Facebook right now?
8584409	8584629	What?
8585149	8586690	I'm still not in the Civ World beta.
8587090	8588011	That pisses me off.
8588851	8589332	Just saying.
8589712	8590352	Sorry, Rob.
8590853	8591233	I'm mad.
8591973	8592534	Don't be mad.
8593374	8593914	Get even.
8595696	8597076	So, guess what?
8598237	8604441	Kazuo Hirai is now the chairman of Sony SCEI.
8605891	8608836	Yeah, he's now the head doo-doo in charge
8610240	8613422	And guess who is replacing him as group CEO?
8614502	8615583	That would be Andrew House.
8616223	8617063	He's taking over.
8617644	8622146	But guess what's happening to Ken Kutaragi, the crayon eater and helmet wearer?
8622686	8624207	He's retiring for reals.
8624807	8627429	Except he's going to hang around as senior technology advisor.
8627689	8631891	He's going to a very special home where they serve crayons for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
8632891	8636113	He's going to be eating the rest of his dinner through straws.
8638418	8639300	For the rest of his life.
8640042	8643331	Because they don't give you food that you can hurt yourself with in the home.
8645868	8647109	He's gonna be eating some Gerber!
8648269	8674104	No, um, but yeah, he actually, uh, did retire, but he's remaining behind as Senior Technology Advisor, and, yeah, it seems like a really crappy time to do, like, oh, you just, uh, have the most insecure system ever, blah blah blah, oh, here's a promotion, but really the fact is that, um, Akira Sato retired, so that's why they're shoving people up.
8677611	8681393	We knew there was going to be a management shakeup coming though after everything that they went through the past few months.
8681413	8683914	But I thought it would be deserved firings.
8685554	8686155	Sackings.
8687055	8688596	I like the word sacking a little more.
8690597	8692458	I would like them to be rendered redundant.
8693798	8694578	Alright, moving on.
8694658	8695659	Loki, what do you got for us?
8697534	8700476	We were talking... You're watching the Giggling Girls video, aren't you?
8700676	8701297	Yes, I am.
8702558	8704539	Oh my god, it's so awesome!
8704839	8706260	Oh my god, it's GLaDOS!
8706321	8708422	And now for two giggling schoolgirls!
8709903	8712465	By the way, that is the third podcast that OLR is working on.
8712525	8713946	It's Giggling Girls Playing Video Games.
8714247	8714647	I'm just kidding.
8715668	8717669	Wouldn't that be the Giggling Lesbian Show?
8718310	8719811	I wish, if they still lived here.
8721723	8746733	Anyways, the PSP remaster titles that were announced during both E3 and their own events, they're basically able to do this because of the help of a PSP engine that's a software development kit that Sony put out regarding these PSP remaster titles that allows them to be able to port them into HD.
8747613	8774643	and with high resolution rendering, stereoscopic 3D and wireless controller support for DualShock 3 and apparently they haven't announced any more remastered titles other than Monster Hunter Portable 3rd and then also of course there's I mean they call it the remastered title but the God of War Origins Collection which is coming out that's basically the two PSP God of War games um
8776277	8776457	Funny!
8786573	8787293	Sorry I'm slow.
8787333	8790254	I'm chatting with listeners about Final Fantasy XIII.
8790274	8791915	We're talking about what parties we use.
8792555	8799857	And they're telling me that... Somebody... Who's telling me that they use... Dungeon Buster is saying I think it's Lightning, Saws, and Vanilla.
8799877	8801017	I'm like, who do you have as a Sentinel?
8801037	8802238	Because you don't have a Sentinel in that party.
8802598	8803898	Like, you have to have Fang or Snow.
8804198	8805999	And I don't use Snow because he's a whiny vagina.
8806299	8807799	But I like Fang because she's hardcore.
8807839	8808820	So I use her as my Sentinel.
8808840	8809040	Anyway.
8810615	8811876	Oh yeah, PSP remasters.
8811916	8812236	Cool.
8812316	8812757	Cool deal.
8813978	8815159	Any of those worth getting, you think?
8816520	8822305	Um... I didn't really play Monster Hunter and God of War... I don't know.
8822345	8824787	God of War would be fun to play, I guess.
8825247	8828670	I haven't really played in... I only think I went through all the way in 2.
8829871	8834855	I know I didn't play all the way through in 1 because my... It glitched out in 1.
8835096	8837338	At the very last boss.
8840465	8865934	um going on to anticipated games Gears of War 3 has leaked to the internet already uh oh this is a uh not a finalized build by the way but it does have the full campaign and there are some multiplayer modes this could be the E3 build of the game but not sure uh they say it's a developer build or what they call oh and you've heard this term on the show before a JTAG version of the game
8866374	8869616	You may need a special modified Xbox 360 or dev kit to run it.
8869756	8875739	But Loki would never indulge in that because that would be wrong to download that and play that.
8875899	8876780	Yes, that would be wrong.
8876800	8886646	And it's a developer version of the game because JTAGS basically can operate like a developer's console.
8887386	8888887	I have a dev kit too, so that'd be...
8889702	8917251	so if you're trying to keep yourself spoiler free on Gears of War 3 stories you might want to leave the internet you might want to take a break from the internet for about 6 months or whenever this game is supposed to come out yeah, careful because they do have a bunch of different I guess builds in here they have a testing, shipping, release and then multiplayer so they're testing a bunch of different things
8918888	8945030	by the way I love having a podcast can I just say that I love this like you know I was just bitching a minute ago that I'm not playing Civ World and one of the listeners just said oh there's an invite in your inbox now aww love the internet love it I love it I wish Google Plus had been that easy if I didn't invite you like during that 90 minute window that one night you got screwed I didn't get my invite I know cause they shut it off like I cannot invite people now to Google Plus fucking retarded
8945991	8948374	It'll be opened up soon for others.
8948874	8950376	We'll see.
8951057	8952338	There's not a lot on there right now.
8952678	8955762	It's just, you know, yay, I'm on Google Plus and it's not Facebook.
8955802	8958404	Like that's what every status update I see on there is right now.
8958464	8959526	Hey, it's not Facebook.
8960987	8964951	Also, it's not Facebook, but is 10 times more awesome is our mailbag.
8966092	8971798	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Every week DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and dives in and reads some emails.
8972418	8975021	She's going to share them with you right now if she can stop playing on Tumblr.
8976342	8978685	I'm putting something important to other artists on there.
8980046	8981988	Well, I will tell you what it is because it's actually pretty cool.
8982028	8988775	The iCloud logo is actually using the golden ratio as its design background.
8988795	8989155	So anyway.
8990961	9000427	Implications of Brown vs. EMA ruling.
9000807	9002528	You'll talk the subject to death this week.
9002628	9008252	I find whenever I try to explain this to a non-gamer, they not only don't care, but they think it doesn't affect them.
9008832	9018658	Every time they play Solitaire, Farmville, Bejeweled, take an online test, give games to their kids, or anything else software related, they're doing so without fear of breaking a bunch of state-by-state laws.
9019198	9024401	Soon we won't do anything without some sort of interactive media, be it a question or a controller.
9024561	9026082	It affects everyone in the USA.
9026202	9028023	My two bits without repeating a story.
9030224	9031225	I've given him some more babas.
9033620	9043786	And, okay, there is a couple, actually one from Game Politics, another story that he linked, about Star Wars Galaxy's players filing a class action lawsuit.
9044266	9044907	Wow, really?
9045447	9046588	I want to know more about that, actually.
9046808	9049470	Because the game is shutting down soon, right?
9049870	9051110	So they're filing class action lawsuits?
9051171	9051391	Why?
9051951	9053632	It's got to be lifetime subscriptions, isn't it?
9055831	9063093	So basically it says that more than 50 Star Wars Galaxies players are filing a class action lawsuit against Sony.
9064613	9069014	And there are a bunch of other players that says that they will do the same thing.
9071215	9075175	Because Sony is shutting down... They basically are having their petitions go out.
9075195	9079877	But the problem is that they agreed that Sony could cancel the game at any time.
9080437	9080717	So...
9082217	9083818	and their SOL.
9083938	9087900	I'm pretty sure that's in the terms of service for any MMO, even Warcraft.
9088060	9089301	They can pull the plug at any time.
9089601	9091622	Remember Warcraft shut down in China for four months?
9091742	9092362	That could happen here.
9092882	9093102	Yeah.
9093262	9094103	It won't, but it could.
9095211	9124735	well also about the whole Resident Evil Mercenaries basically Amazon customers are actually putting like huge huge negative reviews on Amazon like there is one person saying I don't care how much fun this game is or how good it looks or how much it costs there's one save slot save data is permanent and cannot be deleted Capcom is attempting to set a new precedent in consumer manipulation and control with this product
9127256	9127456	Yes.
9131279	9136143	And then, Dear Sakura, Loki, and Roger.
9139345	9139966	Roar!
9140086	9141167	This is Roger Roberts.
9142672	9147977	This week, a game company did slash said slash didn't do slash didn't say something.
9148437	9150919	This thing is the worst thing in the history of the world and ever.
9151240	9151960	That's bad.
9152421	9154583	Roar!
9154883	9154583	112.
9155423	9156404	Stay Black, Red Entertainment.
9156985	9158746	This message has been brought to you by Korn.
9159046	9161649	Korn, great addition to tacos, bad addition to Silent Hill.
9162069	9164591	After all, adding Korn to tacos has never caused haze.
9166353	9167154	Sent from my iPad.
9168976	9170657	I'm allergic to corn of all kinds.
9170877	9173919	So I'm assuming my name got auto-corrected to Roger.
9174119	9175900	No, because Julian called you Roger.
9176340	9177961	Oh, that's... He said, happy birthday, Roger.
9178041	9178562	That's right.
9178902	9179342	That's right.
9179802	9180303	I remember now.
9180883	9182744	Shit, I forgot to bring back the cake plate.
9182784	9185546	Which, by the way, a certain someone is listening right now.
9185686	9186026	Hi.
9186626	9189228	I hope the four-year-old's not listening with all our potty mouth language.
9193330	9196332	Didn't you say you wanted to say something to... I said it on Facebook.
9196792	9196892	Okay.
9196912	9197413	Take care of that.
9198007	9200028	Okay, I didn't know you wanted to say something publicly.
9200208	9201309	Well, thank you for the cake.
9201389	9203690	I think I expressed that last week.
9203750	9204591	No, no, no, it's fine.
9205932	9208773	Okay, this is from Chiggers, which that's the worst nickname ever.
9208813	9210254	No, I love that nickname.
9211215	9212335	Do you know what those are?
9212355	9224382	Uh-oh, is it something really... They're bugs that burrow under your skin and lay their eggs and infect under your skin and then the eggs hatch and they come out of your skin leaving these weird zombie-like trails on your arms.
9224662	9225443	I've seen it happen.
9226209	9227270	That's kind of awesome, actually.
9227290	9228170	It's really disgusting.
9229191	9232434	Dear OLR, long-time listener, six years, first-time emailer.
9232654	9233374	By the way, hearts.
9234875	9238058	I've noticed PS3 is now starting to put out TurboGrafx-16 games.
9238498	9246124	Do you think it's possible they may try and get some games that were released out on the SNES or Saturn from any third-party publishers?
9246204	9248325	Keep up the good work and belated happy ninth anniversary.
9248826	9250927	Yours truly, in Horde House, Gildy, Chickers.
9252168	9252908	DarkSakura.com
9272233	9296581	Anyhow, as far as the whole PlayStation 3, TurboGrafx-16 games No, they will not get games on the NES, SNES, or any of that Even if they were third party Even if they were third party because you're emulating the hardware that doesn't belong And so I think the whole licensing and all that would be I mean, they would have to completely redo the game Completely redo it And I just don't see that happening They're not gonna Yeah
9298392	9301374	I mean, never say never just like Nintendo.
9301514	9305737	It would be hilarious if they did Saturn games on a PlayStation at all.
9306258	9307939	That would just be lol.
9309400	9312002	The big competition was the Saturn and PlayStation back in the day.
9312022	9313984	Or what about PlayStation games on a Dreamcast?
9315121	9318144	I have three video games that I can play on my Dreamcast.
9318164	9318704	That's the joke.
9318884	9319305	Was it what?
9319365	9320806	It was Tekken and Crazy Taxi?
9320826	9324149	Tekken 3 and Crazy Taxi and Metal Gear.
9324409	9325149	Metal Gear Solid.
9325190	9325630	Was it really?
9325650	9326110	Yes, it was.
9326130	9327451	That was all Bleemcast, by the way.
9327471	9328252	They were Bleemcast.
9328352	9330694	I remember when I tried to run Bleem on my PC.
9330774	9335278	Granted, this was way back in the day and that did not work.
9335338	9337880	I remember when I had an emulator that worked better than Bleem.
9339716	9353239	and we were trying to play Street Fighter EX3 that was lousy because it still ran like crap but yeah Tekken actually did look a lot better on Dreamcast just saying that's it
9354540	9359082	Email us, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Make DarkSakura work more next week.
9359202	9368146	Send us more emails, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Meanwhile, we do a segment here every week on the show that sometimes has to do with video games, sometimes not.
9368246	9368506	Why?
9368586	9369386	Because we can.
9370307	9370827	F-U's of the week!
9386315	9388716	F you to everybody who's eating at Wendy's today, Rob.
9390096	9390996	Haters gonna hate.
9391116	9392436	For not bringing me a Frosty.
9393697	9395737	Because I wanted a Frosty all day.
9395837	9399118	I didn't get a Frosty, but the berry tea was very good, I'm not gonna lie.
9399218	9401958	I even told my husband to go get me a Frosty, and you know what he did?
9402278	9404139	He went across the street and got a hamburger.
9405019	9406999	And then he brought me one, and I just had a hot dog.
9407059	9408260	Oh, from your neighbors that are cooking?
9408500	9408740	Yes.
9409140	9410080	We're doing our barbecue tomorrow.
9410760	9412881	You did tell the neighbors it's July 3rd, right?
9413901	9414381	No one curve.
9416698	9418099	F you to Wendy's for sucking.
9418779	9419120	Hey.
9419520	9420961	Because they have terrible food.
9421441	9426063	Somebody send me a coupon for free Frosty since you gave Rob a Civ Beta thing.
9428725	9430746	One of them is game related, the other is not.
9431626	9432867	Don't care, I want a Frosty.
9433247	9434427	Frosty's the best thing ever.
9434448	9437149	Do you know what Miklatov tried to convince me was a good idea once?
9437796	9439297	Dipping your french fries into your Frosty?
9439337	9441657	No, dipping chicken McNuggets into Frosty.
9442378	9442638	Gross.
9442658	9443998	What, the Wendy's don't have McNuggets?
9444038	9445059	There's people that love that.
9445079	9445639	You know what I mean.
9445659	9446579	Like chocolate shakes.
9446599	9446899	And Rob.
9447139	9447379	What?
9447459	9448140	It actually is good.
9448420	9448800	No.
9449140	9449800	It's gross.
9450180	9453742	I was going to say, Miklatov, hey, I don't know if he's still working.
9453922	9455322	No, he doesn't still work at GameStop.
9455462	9457343	No, he definitely does not work at GameStop.
9457923	9460784	I need the DLC for Earth Defense Force.
9460844	9463765	I need to pick up that pre-order shit somewhere.
9464705	9491848	ask the listeners someone send me the DLC for Earth Defense Force and you will give them nothing a high five a handshake can't even do that alright my FU of the week goes to this is a work related FU because I don't want people thinking it has to do with other things it's work related FU to surprises work related surprises
9493996	9495336	All right, that's really it.
9495417	9496597	Otherwise, things are actually pretty good.
9497877	9498438	Let's move on.
9499558	9500658	Yeah.
9501118	9502359	So this is kind of neat.
9503219	9506140	I mean, unexpected, I guess, because life goes on, I guess.
9507221	9511222	But Tokyo Game Show is going to have a pretty good showing this year.
9511662	9515503	They're up to 146 exhibitors over the 138 in 2010.
9515864	9521906	And, of course, people are like, earthquake and all the developers, they suffered from it.
9523266	9527189	I mean, it's going to be a while, and you know what?
9527289	9528210	Life does go on.
9529411	9531352	So it's going to be up.
9531532	9537077	They're expecting to see, I guess, or they're going to try to reduce the power usage during the show.
9538098	9542801	They're going to drop it down 25% versus 2010 as well.
9544622	9546884	But overall, it's going to have a really good showing.
9547925	9549106	So it's pretty cool.
9552202	9555444	That's great that it seems like it's going to be such a big, big show.
9555525	9558707	And it's great that they're kind of bouncing with all that recovery stuff.
9558727	9560448	So I'm very happy to hear it, actually.
9561309	9561889	So there you go.
9563971	9569275	Moving on to one last story here about music, music-related stuff.
9569775	9575639	First off, if you didn't already know about this, I imagine most of you listeners already have downloaded this and put them on their iPods.
9575679	9577120	But if you are the one that has not...
9578121	9580824	More Portal 2 free music is now available.
9580964	9583787	Volume 2 of the Songs to Test By.
9584307	9588091	18 new tracks, 14 ringtones for your iPhone and Android devices.
9588532	9590293	I had no idea there were ringtones in there.
9590353	9591875	I need to look more carefully at this stuff.
9592616	9593316	You can check that out.
9593396	9598742	New songs include Bring Your Daughter to Work Day, I Am Not a Moron, and Potatoes Lament.
9599301	9625984	which is actually really cool you can also have the orange or blue portal sound as your messaging ringtone unless you have an iPhone because you can't change your iPhone sounds that's why I didn't notice it yes you can only for the ones that they put on your phone oh yeah that's true volume 3 is coming soon how soon?
9626204	9626845	I said soon
9628726	9656775	also in music related news another Rockman Arrange album of course you know that, here's Mega Man Rockman Unity announced a new Rockman Arrange soundtrack We Are Rockman is the podcast it includes Mashihiro Aoki on guitar Yasumasa Kitagawa on bass he did work on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom All Stars
9657495	9678884	Mitsuhiko, bleep bleep bloop maestro Takano on drums and there will be some guest musicians as well otherwise we don't have a lot of details about the album but some of basically Capcom's greats are getting together to do some rock band arranged music that'll be cool that kind of sounds like what the Black Mages did for Final Fantasy that's kind of what that sounds like to me so there you go
9680103	9681984	Alright, that does it for Gaming News tonight.
9682084	9682525	We're done.
9683205	9683886	We're out of here.
9684706	9686787	But not until we open up the Skype line and take some calls.
9686807	9689349	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9689389	9691410	Give us a call and you can talk with us.
9691791	9695813	We can talk about any of the stories we've talked about tonight or maybe we missed something that you wanted to talk about.
9696254	9703278	Do you want to talk about Nintendo and the localization or maybe you want to talk more about, I don't know, Minecraft or Gears of War 3 leaking.
9703298	9704559	Whatever it is you want to talk about, give us a call.
9704579	9708522	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9709382	9712165	In the meantime, you know I'm going to ask Loki if there's any last minute stories.
9712765	9720151	So apparently, because to celebrate Independence Day, you can now dress up your avatar on Xbox 360 as a Confederate soldier.
9722233	9722593	Awesome.
9723073	9723654	Oh boy.
9723734	9724234	Go south.
9726496	9728377	I don't know, that's kind of weird.
9729939	9732521	Not at all a bad thing.
9732541	9732621	Yeah.
9734352	9740615	What do you mean that they... Oh, but okay, it's just like you do the right combination of hats and gear.
9740635	9743817	No, they have Civil War uniform, 160 Microsoft points.
9744137	9744537	Really?
9745558	9746018	Interesting.
9746058	9749380	But you could do also the other stuff.
9749440	9751701	They have also some funny hats.
9753182	9754403	Because everyone loves funny hats.
9756043	9756824	I love funny hats.
9758416	9771645	It'd just be weird though, like, since a lot of that DLC doesn't translate over though into games, it would still be funny like playing, you know, seeing it or something like that with a civil, you know, a confederate soldier or something.
9771706	9773427	Anything else in last minute news tonight?
9777910	9779091	Earth Defense Force is awesome.
9779864	9781805	I actually watched you playing that a little bit over there.
9781905	9783365	It's really hard.
9783425	9785646	Seriously, and I'm only playing it easy.
9785866	9789867	Apparently, if you play the harder difficulties, you can turn your AI bots off.
9791248	9792128	I don't even want to know.
9792448	9799070	And then once you beat the game, they also have a campaign remix where you can play with different enemies spawning.
9799790	9802111	So it's got a lot of gameplay built in there.
9802151	9806833	I'm sorry if I'm just ranting about this game, but it's worth picking up.
9807193	9808233	You are a little bit, but it's fine.
9809620	9810640	We all knew this would happen.
9810660	9812421	You've been talking about this game for like a year.
9813441	9815242	Just you wait until Saints Row 3 comes out.
9815262	9817023	You think this is bad.
9817043	9823185	I actually kind of want to be there when you're playing Saints Row 3 for the first time.
9823585	9827206	I don't know how I can do that, but we need to have a Saints Row 3 party.
9827246	9828226	It's going to be fucking nuts.
9828666	9830267	Okay, so here's something we can talk about.
9830287	9833068	We can stream it on the internet, except, oh shit, we would be breaking the law.
9833708	9836889	1-877-GAME-OLR His name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio if you want to give us a call.
9836929	9838670	Bunchy Aerospace was finally announced.
9838690	9856296	What that is, it's a partnership program with social and mobile devs where they're basically going to help either publish, promote, or draw interest for different games that are coming out on these platforms where they may not get as much interest.
9856936	9858157	So that's kind of cool.
9858357	9863799	Unfortunately, they will not be building spaceships as not part of the aerospace program.
9864019	9864720	Let's go to the phones.
9864760	9865280	We have a call.
9865300	9867801	1-877-GAME-OLR after this is done.
9867841	9868582	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9868602	9868902	Who's this?
9869622	9869822	Pleasure.
9869842	9870422	I'm Zaku here.
9870442	9870923	Hi, Zaku.
9870943	9871243	What's up?
9872563	9873064	Nothing much.
9873104	9875725	Just trying to recover before tomorrow and everything.
9876405	9880007	Well, tomorrow's when the real parties are supposed to happen.
9880127	9882008	Tomorrow is when the real parties are supposed to happen.
9883405	9885947	I don't know, just like a barbecue at my place at home.
9886347	9886687	Oh, okay.
9886987	9889348	That and trying to go out with this girl tomorrow.
9890229	9891029	Well, I hope he gets some.
9891049	9892951	What's on your mind tonight?
9893011	9908860	Nothing much, just like trying to lament over the fallout of what transpired last week with the whole Supreme Court decision, which I know you probably covered in great detail before this call.
9909200	9910681	We did, but what are your thoughts?
9911829	9921617	I don't know, on one hand, it's like they're grasping at straws and trying to legislate something that's already been declared protected speech for all intents and purposes.
9921737	9935408	So it's like the people who were the ones who pushed the particular person that pushed the law and actually introduced the law and got it passed,
9936129	9937090	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9956061	9963364	Well, but what about how there were a couple justices that basically said, you can regulate games just not like this.
9964065	9966706	That's leaving the door wide open for somebody else.
9966766	9967226	I know.
9967806	9976270	Some have said it's a 5-4 split in reality because two of them concurred with the... Yeah, two of the other justices concurred with Scalia.
9977130	9977310	Right.
9977650	9983693	Yeah, so it's basically... It's like they weren't for it, but at the same time, they were in between.
9983873	9984053	So...
9985422	9999451	It wasn't like a, you know, if you really get, if you really go deep into that decision, there's not that much, there's only like a, you know, a thin, you know, thin margin of just prevailing opinion.
9999531	10000151	What do you think about this?
10000171	10003793	Something that's just like, that it barely got through.
10004213	10007415	Let me quickly ask you, what do you think about this other bill we spent some time talking about tonight?
10007435	10011118	The whole, you know, no more streaming of movies and games and so forth.
10012318	10012979	Oh, that one is...
10014383	10016387	That one right there, that's a landmine.
10017028	10023339	I'm pretty sure if it ever comes to court, one way or another we'll know what impact it has.
10023940	10025263	Right now it's very murky.
10026590	10031392	And you're just waiting, and they're just waiting, you know, the feds are just waiting to at least use it on something.
10032012	10032913	I can't wait for the 12-year-old.
10032933	10039375	Some guy just, like, leaking a trailer on YouTube or just posting up a gameplay footage.
10039936	10049300	And for some reason, you know, some video game company, which doesn't, you know, which took offense to that whole act, will sick the feds on them.
10049420	10049900	Think about it.
10050060	10050900	I can't wait for the
10072253	10075458	I understand, but guess who owns and still has control of the music?
10075518	10087135	No, I get it, but I mean, if I... The label, remember, Lady Gaga's only one person that, until she's met the, until she's already honored the contract with her label, she doesn't own her music.
10087896	10089617	She's a slave, just like Prince was.
10090058	10090678	Exactly.
10091399	10091999	And that's the thing.
10092059	10098604	Unless you own your master tracks and you can take them anywhere else, then you have control of it.
10098724	10105288	Otherwise, you've already sold your soul to the label, and they'll be the ones taking the feds on that 10-year-old kid.
10105528	10107590	Alright, any other quick thoughts before we let you go and get another call?
10108686	10114809	Yeah, take advantage of these sales right now on these sites, Amazon, Steam in particular.
10116070	10118631	A lot of really good stuff to be had right now.
10118691	10121372	Great FYI in chat from William Murderface.
10121572	10122373	Always love that name.
10122873	10128576	Oh, if anyone's looking for a Diablo 2 fix and does not have Torchlight, it's on sale for $2.99 on Steam today.
10128656	10129396	Yeah, it's a $3 game.
10129456	10130637	I'm thinking about it right now.
10130657	10131197	It's like...
10131497	10137242	If you even remotely like Diablo or Diablo 2, you will get $3 worth out of Torchlight.
10137262	10139323	But I've played that game, you know, years ago.
10139523	10142025	All I remember is just, like, mashing my mouse.
10142546	10144407	Just click mashing.
10144487	10147250	It's very much a dungeon... Well, here's the great thing.
10147350	10147950	Do you have a 360?
10149752	10151233	Yes, but I... Go download the demo.
10152254	10154355	I want to just do it for my... I want to keep it old school.
10155076	10155156	Ugh.
10155919	10157542	We can at least download the demo to see what the game's like.
10157582	10159025	Alright, I gotta let you go to get more calls.
10159145	10159846	Take care, buddy.
10160969	10161930	I think Torchlight's a great deal.
10161970	10163113	But yeah, it's a dungeon crawler.
10163774	10168443	So, I don't know, if you aren't into the dungeon crawlers, you may not like it, but we'll see.
10169045	10170246	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10170266	10170606	Who's this?
10171247	10172008	Hey, it's Ranma.
10172028	10172768	What's up, everyone?
10172949	10173389	Not much.
10173669	10175211	You know, just hanging.
10176111	10176572	Chillin'.
10177012	10178353	Smoking a little, you know.
10179535	10181817	Smoking a J. I'm allergic.
10181977	10182517	We don't do that.
10183018	10184199	Oh, pass it over this way, man.
10184219	10184919	It's the fourth.
10185160	10186161	What's on your mind?
10186681	10195069	Yes, I can think of no better way on Spending Independence Day than burning various things, including fireworks, our money, and a J.
10197404	10199546	I'm not going to complain, so it works for me.
10200808	10202490	Only in America will we celebrate fire.
10202550	10203071	What's on your mind?
10204432	10205994	I have just one question.
10206014	10209238	I've been meaning to ask you guys this for as long as I keep forgetting.
10209258	10210099	The answer is no.
10211121	10212382	God damn it, Rob.
10213083	10213864	What's the question?
10213904	10214305	I'm kidding.
10214881	10216002	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10233395	10234737	turn their back on the fans.
10234917	10236920	They're just looking for a quick pop.
10237420	10245711	The other half are saying Konami is doing this to garner interest into the series to see if it's worth another game.
10245991	10246532	What do you think?
10248694	10250935	I think it's a little bit of both, to be honest.
10251035	10258457	I think it's, you know, why not make a little more cash on games that were previously out, although they are having to redo them and so forth.
10258497	10260558	You know, they're having to change it up a little bit.
10261478	10264639	But if the game sold phenomenally.
10265459	10266060	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10283043	10311322	I think the games will sell alright and as far as Konami's motivation I mean, it's hard to say because the whole repackaging thing you can't say that Konami's the first to do it so I think they're just jumping on a bandwagon that people have shown they want to be on God of War has already done it the Ico games Shadow of the Colossus all that stuff's being redone so the gaming populace has already shown they'll buy it so you can't really blame Konami for putting it out there
10311542	10319605	and even stuff that's come out recently like the Prince of Persia trilogy, the Splinter Cell trilogy is coming out a little bit later and Tomb Raider.
10320225	10321846	They already did all those as well.
10323647	10325027	Okay, I understand that.
10325187	10339513	Now, do you think maybe time could be also a factor in this compared to like if the games came out within a certain range and maybe a couple years later they put out the collection compared to maybe waiting like five, six years later for a complete collection?
10341158	10342340	I'm not sure I follow you.
10342400	10343922	These collections are coming out next year.
10343942	10346085	I'd say they put out Zone of the Enders 1, 2, and 3, let's say in 2000, 2001, 2002.
10346166	10349711	And in 2005, they put out the collectors of all three together.
10357592	10362335	Now let's say instead of 2005, they wait until about now to put them all out.
10362355	10363776	They wait almost 10 years.
10364096	10367258	Yeah, but they're going to up-res them and make them more current.
10368219	10370561	They're redoing them in HD, so I'm okay with it.
10371361	10372302	Let's also be honest.
10372342	10373803	How is this any different from the movie industry?
10375224	10378747	The movie industry does this shit all the time, and we eat it up.
10379287	10381049	How many times have the Star Wars movies come out?
10381429	10386694	And they're coming out again on Blu-ray, and I know tons of people that'll be there right when they come out.
10386714	10387875	I don't mean to interrupt, Rob.
10387895	10391819	That's because George Lucas turned his back on the fans, and he's a money-grubbing whore.
10392739	10394941	I know that, but the new Star Tours is really awesome.
10395682	10399345	But what about Harry Potter?
10400532	10404613	When those movies come out, they come out on Blu-ray and then you can get a box set with 1 through 5.
10405393	10406973	And then when 6 came out, you could buy 6.
10407093	10410774	Oh, and then now it's a box set with 1 through 6 and maybe some other bonus features.
10410814	10411454	A preview of 7.
10412254	10412955	Oh, now 7's out.
10413215	10415795	Now there's a box set of 1 through 7 and there'll be a preview for 8.
10416675	10423557	And there'll be another box set when 8 comes out and it'll have the special features online, Uber, God, Poopy Pop.
10423597	10423837	Rob?
10424037	10424237	What?
10425257	10426437	Book 7 was the last one.
10427197	10428178	But there was 8 movies.
10428718	10429398	I'm talking about the movies.
10430160	10432941	I know, book seven was two movies, but I see your point.
10433021	10435081	I was just trying to be an ass.
10435101	10435821	You're trying to be an ass.
10435841	10437442	Wait, wait, wait, now hold on a second.
10437602	10441763	Is not, is not this new movie the eighth movie coming out?
10442423	10446844	I understand it's two parts, but it is, in the line of movies, the eighth movie.
10446884	10449385	Yeah, yes, it is the eighth movie.
10449645	10449925	It is.
10449985	10454086	Watch Warner Brothers release both movies together as movie seven.
10454246	10455406	Just to fuck with you.
10456980	10458021	It's just like Twilight.
10458401	10460763	Aren't they splitting the last one into two so there's five movies?
10460803	10463806	Yeah, as if it hasn't drug out long enough already.
10463946	10465547	Let's put the last one in the two.
10466929	10467129	Ugh.
10467689	10468590	Boring.
10468830	10472533	DJ Morpheus in our chatroom says, actually, Lord of the Rings is the biggest DVD whore.
10473074	10473915	That's, yeah.
10474335	10479019	Now Blu-ray whore because the super extended editions, yes, as if that movie wasn't long enough.
10479399	10483523	And theatrical re-release bullshit, which I don't give a shit about and I won't go see.
10484232	10485494	I wouldn't mind going to see it.
10485915	10486275	You know what?
10486796	10487737	I don't know if I should admit this.
10489139	10490281	I never saw the third movie.
10491776	10492156	I saw it.
10492176	10494757	I saw the first two opening day, nonetheless.
10494857	10495558	I never saw the third movie.
10495578	10498559	You know, for me, and people are going to go, oh, you're a hater.
10499339	10502061	But the whole point is that I read the books.
10503121	10505082	The movies were good.
10506463	10510824	I'm more interested in The Hobbit coming out because I like The Hobbit better than I liked the other books.
10510945	10512205	I can't believe you read those books.
10512305	10513286	I've tried to read those books.
10513386	10513766	I can't.
10513866	10516327	I'm like, speak a language I can read.
10516427	10518348	Tolkien was so fucking boring.
10519640	10524284	It was a good story, but my god, we don't need that much description of the grass.
10524564	10526585	Ranma, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.
10527206	10531609	Rob, before I go, I just want to say, in response to Twilight, I love that picture you posted on your Tumblr.
10532830	10540276	The one of the stakes on the fence that says, in case of sparkly vampires, or break off in case of sparkly vampires, right?
10540356	10543318	And I think I posted it and I put, how about screaming fangirls, too?
10543888	10548191	Yes, and before I go, I'm going to say I dedicate this picture to you that I put on my blog post.
10548652	10550173	I just posted it in the chat room.
10550253	10550533	All right.
10551073	10551474	You got it.
10551994	10552234	All right.
10552594	10552815	Later.
10558899	10559960	Sorry for the awkward silence there.
10559980	10564643	I was typing an important message because there's a YouTube I want to find real quick there, so I'm trying to find it there.
10564683	10566465	Let me look at what Ranma posted to his Tumblr.
10566485	10567165	Hold on one sec.
10567225	10567465	Okay.
10569254	10571157	and I'm following the link and let's see.
10574002	10574603	I love that.
10575044	10577869	It's haters gonna hate but it's Frank and Furter from the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
10577889	10578691	You see this, DarkSakura?
10579767	10580567	Oh, that's awesome.
10580808	10583029	Okay, you need to put that on Tumblr so I can reblog it.
10583069	10583969	It's on Ranma's Tumblr.
10584249	10584749	Okay, then I'll reblog it.
10584769	10585330	If you follow him.
10586090	10587591	What's up with... Now it's Tumblr.
10588811	10593574	There was LiveJournal, which I'm a permanent member of, so I always have to love LiveJournal forever and ever.
10594054	10595234	There's Facebook.
10595715	10597896	There's MySpace back in the day.
10598356	10599696	Friendster, shit.
10599777	10600217	Twitter.
10600617	10601297	And now there's fucking Tumblr.
10601317	10602078	I never used Friendster.
10602558	10603158	I never used it.
10603218	10603578	Really?
10603938	10604819	How did you avoid that?
10606080	10608581	It was... I love my LiveJournal so much.
10608921	10609041	Mm-hmm.
10612461	10616043	Hey, it's Blender.
10616603	10617684	Nothing.
10619085	10626949	You know, I kind of wanted to go back to this whole class action lawsuit that you guys were talking about with these online games.
10627049	10627669	Yeah.
10628049	10636654	I think eventually somebody's going to find a loophole and actually get in on this.
10638103	10641565	I know a couple of you guys are into Disney and all that.
10641605	10644988	Do you remember the Virtual Magic Kingdom game?
10645128	10646269	I don't know if you ever heard of it.
10646809	10649732	I remember the NES game Adventures in the Magic.
10649832	10650512	Oh, wait, no, no, no.
10650652	10651133	Online.
10651173	10653374	No, no, it was the online MMO.
10653495	10654355	I don't think I ever played it.
10654375	10656097	That Disney put out for the 50-year anniversary.
10657438	10660060	You know, I'm familiar with some of the Disney MMOs.
10660220	10663782	I know Club Penguin, and I know that they're infamous for not letting you type.
10664803	10665123	Yeah.
10665184	10666865	You can only select from select phrases.
10667836	10668657	Well, no, no, no.
10668957	10679606	Well, what they did is for the 50-year anniversary, they created an MMO, which was a free walk through Disneyland Park, and you can create friends and meet people.
10680427	10683229	And it really messed up some people when they closed that site down.
10683410	10684791	In fact, I got a link.
10685771	10690733	I don't know if it's going to post, but... Rob, Peter was telling us about that when we were at the park.
10690953	10694434	I don't... I just... Because I have a pin from it.
10694975	10695955	Oh, that's right.
10696015	10696875	That I do remember.
10696895	10697196	Yeah.
10697276	10697536	Yes.
10697696	10698596	I tried it with a cast member.
10698616	10700737	Yeah, I have one of the links that I just picked.
10700797	10703918	It was from Joystick.com is when they closed the actual site.
10704658	10709700	And, you know, it was really devastating because I was actually on it for like two years.
10710681	10710821	And...
10714000	10716122	It killed a lot of kids.
10716322	10722127	There was like 10, 11-year-old kids, or even younger, that couldn't play this game anymore.
10722768	10729614	And I really think that if somebody's going to find a loophole with closing down these large MMOs, that they're going to...
10731397	10732057	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10751550	10755813	Here, open up your own damn servers, and if you want to copy your characters over, here's how you do it.
10756274	10756874	Like, isn't that right?
10757394	10766961	DarkSakura, you followed this better than I did, but Blue Burst, when they went under, Sega was very much like... Sega was like, here's your character data, and you can transfer it to the server of your choice.
10767322	10767522	Yeah.
10768342	10777850	But, you're in an interesting position with Star Wars Galaxies, because they probably just don't... They want those people playing the Bioware Star Wars game that's coming out.
10778770	10778890	Mm-hmm.
10778910	10779030	Mm-hmm.
10803001	10830690	the closest thing you get are these expansions such as Cataclysm that changed Warcraft so drastically it's almost like a sequel so that's what you're the way you're talking about it is breaking it up instead of like for example Virtual Magic Kingdom where they closed it down totally they should have gone open source so somebody who loved it could have kept it going but how can you force a company to do that?
10832102	10841586	Yeah, and it's so funny because I had a bunch of friends on there, and we were on there for, oh, we'd go on there every day, you know.
10842666	10851890	And the thing was, the kids that were on this actual site weren't allowed to actually give out emails and communicate with each other.
10852330	10855691	They were only allowed to talk on this virtual Magic Kingdom.
10856809	10860091	You know, you weren't allowed to give any personal information away.
10860271	10862392	Right, right, because you were very restrictive of what you could say.
10862432	10866434	All of a sudden they said in a month from now we're closing the site and it's done.
10866654	10867074	That's it.
10868235	10868835	And people don't...
10869963	10873384	God, it just kills a bunch of these little kids, you know?
10873684	10878945	It's sad, but at the same time, how can you force a company to keep something going that's not making them any money?
10879405	10883906	Hey, if the miniature golf place closes down, what can you do about it?
10884486	10884806	Yeah.
10885346	10890747	Someone's actually made a, quote, replacement called Virtual Family Kingdom.
10891767	10893708	Oh, no, no, yeah, I've seen that one.
10893788	10896068	Actually, everybody jumped over to that.
10896448	10899169	That was sponsored by the Smithsonian Kingdom.
10899958	10902299	or Smithsonian Institute.
10902719	10906820	But it was just horrible when they went over to that.
10907480	10912502	But I don't know if you guys saw the post that I put.
10912802	10914403	You should see some of the stories.
10914443	10920004	There were actually people protesting in front of Disneyland the day that it closed down.
10920044	10920444	Wow.
10920484	10920585	Wow.
10923730	10926412	Well, maybe they'll be protesting on Star Wars.
10940976	10943037	You know, I'm going to be able to get some money out of it.
10943357	10943798	I don't know.
10944178	10948661	I still think the terms of service are going to ultimately let the companies come out ahead.
10948981	10949381	But we'll see.
10949741	10950442	Alright, we'll see.
10950502	10952002	I've got to let you go, buddy, before we wrap up the show.
10952243	10952883	Thank you for your call.
10953183	10953683	I appreciate it.
10954484	10955064	It was a good topic.
10955264	10955645	I like that.
10956465	10957886	Blender, live on OLR.
10974372	10986681	I don't know you guys, I got sent this YouTube and this is a YouTube of DJ Ranma S actually watching the Breaking Dawn trailer and let's see how Ranma actually reacted to seeing this trailer the first time.
10988562	10989783	Fucking massive boobs.
11006465	11008107	God, Ranma, you're getting really upset over this.
11013633	11014794	Don't get naked.
11016035	11017377	Don't get naked, Ranma.
11017417	11020080	You were the one talking about vagina in the chat room earlier.
11020721	11020821	No.
11025785	11026606	Breaking Dawn Trailer Badly Written
11053689	11057731	I tried to read a page of that and I was like, who let this woman write?
11059872	11069337	There should be a class action lawsuit against Bic for selling that woman a pen.
11069357	11070698	I blame her for being Mormon.
11073939	11075620	I love DJ Morpheus in chat.
11075860	11077061	That's just cold, Rob.
11077301	11079682	That's coming from Travis, of all people.
11081603	11082544	Dude, that's just cold.
11083686	11086708	Alright, that's going to do it for another week of Orange on Trail.
11087008	11088129	Do we have any other last minute news?
11090291	11091211	Just real quick stuff.
11091291	11091852	I'm alive.
11091872	11094093	It's supposed to be coming out still.
11095995	11100378	Classifications are found on the Australian website and Crisis is supposed to be coming to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
11102278	11103178	because this is on the ESRB.
11104439	11104719	All right.
11105219	11107460	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.
11107560	11113022	Before we get the final thoughts, I want to thank you once again for listening to Orange Launch Radio and supporting us over these nine years of our program.
11113583	11115143	Of course, we're here to do it every Sunday night.
11115183	11117864	So if you've never come out for a live show, it's a bummer.
11117924	11120926	Tonight would have been a great night because many folks out there don't work on Monday.
11121006	11125187	But, you know, if you have the time in the future, please do consider joining us for a live show.
11125227	11127488	We do tape live at All Games Radio, allgames.com.

11131070	11132010	You always say specific.
11132150	11132570	DarkSakura.com
11155287	11158790	Choo is the sound that What's-Her-Name makes in Space Channel 5.
11158850	11159731	La la.
11159751	11160751	Because it's Choo!
11161472	11161872	Ooh la la.
11162052	11163053	Ooh la la.
11163353	11166096	Actually, Space Channel 5 Part 2 is on Steam for six bucks.
11166996	11167336	Oh, nice.
11167577	11167737	Yeah.
11168217	11169458	I already have like two copies of it.
11170059	11170439	Very nice.
11170979	11171980	Lots of good stuff to buy on Steam.
11172020	11174002	I'm telling you, BitTrip Runner, if it's still $2.50, is a great buy.
11176147	11178448	Anyhow, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lodge Radio.
11178488	11179268	Please help spread the word.
11180809	11184250	OrangeLodgeRadio.com, join our website, check the forums, all that good stuff.
11184290	11185891	We really need to get the activity on the forums again.
11185911	11188372	I've got to really think about how we can get those going.
11188852	11191994	But meanwhile, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for tonight.
11192014	11192874	So Loki, we'll start with you.
11192894	11193734	What's your final thought tonight?
11194635	11198276	I need to work in some more Earth Defense Force this weekend.
11199096	11200597	I had to play it for a few hours last night.
11200997	11202718	I really need to play more of that.
11204615	11206398	My final thought of the night is, you know what?
11206458	11208400	Vanille and Hope, they aren't that bad.
11208761	11211184	Like 30 hours later, they aren't that bad.
11212225	11213306	DarkSakura, your final thought?
11214588	11215269	Lesbians.
11217366	11217947	Fuck yeah.
11219388	11220710	I just looked at Alan's Twitter.
11221091	11222753	I mean, Tumblr.
11222793	11224655	Wait, what's Alan tweeting about lesbians for?
11224735	11225576	This is his picture.
11225696	11228860	Oh, and don't buy, my other final thought, don't buy your games from eBay.
11229821	11232504	Unless they're, well, I guess the used market's okay, but just be careful.
11233205	11234367	Buy or beware on eBay.
11234827	11236830	Just look at the feedback before you buy.
11237370	11248917	that's it guys have a wonderful night thank you so much for downloading tuning in live however you listen to Orange Lounge Radio we really appreciate it thanks for joining us and inviting us into your lives for the past three hours we hope you consider doing it again next week have a great night
