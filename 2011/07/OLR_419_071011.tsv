25000	29000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello everybody on the internet
33000	37000	and welcome back to the show where every gamer has a voice
37000	39000	Orange Lounge Radio
39000	42000	We are live on this July 10th, 2011
42000	45000	for the 419th episode of our show
45000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts
49000	52000	First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
52000	54000	I want cake
54000	56000	Get in line
56000	59000	I had ice cream cake yesterday, it was delish
59000	60000	So did I
60000	61000	I know
61000	63000	And it had princesses on it
63000	66000	Yes, Salacious Pop had a birthday yesterday
66000	69000	and mine was a couple of weeks ago as you might recall
69000	71000	but we did like a joint birthday thing
71000	73000	more closer to his birthday, I'm sorry
73000	76000	His birthday was two days ago but the party was yesterday
76000	78000	and so we had a joint cake
78000	82000	It's one of our friends' bot and it's one of those snarky friends
82000	84000	that's, you know, funny, bitchy funny
84000	89000	and got a cake that said Happy Birthday Princesses with the two Mickey and Minnie Mouse on it
89000	91000	But it was cute and I ate some of the sand part
91000	95000	And I was just very happy because we just didn't want chocolate
95000	98000	because you might remember on OLR a few weeks ago
98000	101000	I got a chocolate cake, which was great, I loved it, don't get me wrong
101000	104000	Then I went to work, and I had a chocolate cake at work from co-workers
104000	106000	and I'm like, oh yay, more chocolate
106000	108000	But I bet Becky's cake was better
108000	110000	Becky's cake was better because hers
110000	113000	you could tell the difference between homemade and store-bought
113000	116000	So I mean, I appreciated the cake at work, don't get me wrong
116000	121000	But, you know, I think the Becky cake was a little more from the heart
121000	124000	if you will, rather than from the grocery store
124000	129000	Anyhow, let's go over to the third co-host on our show
129000	133000	here with us as he's been every single week since episode one
133000	135000	with few minor exceptions like when kids are born
135000	137000	Loki!
137000	138000	Hi
138000	139000	Hi, how are you tonight, Loki?
139000	140000	I'm a little sick, but I'm alright
140000	143000	You're sick? You better not get me sick, I'm gonna kick your butt
143000	147000	Hey, I've been doing everything possible not to get anybody else sick
147000	150000	I'm gonna wash my hands like crazy, and that's pretty much it
150000	153000	That's okay, I've got a bucket of Lysol I could dump on him
153000	155000	You might need to do that, because I really can't get sick
155000	158000	Speaking of work, I have a lot going on at work, I cannot get sick
158000	160000	It's not bad, it's just congestion, that's it
160000	164000	It's not like I'm throwing up or something
164000	168000	It's just like, it could very well be allergies, but it's not
168000	170000	And it all started with one damn sneeze
170000	174000	I sneezed, and then all of a sudden I'm like, ugh, and I'm sick
174000	175000	It's like an avalanche
175000	176000	It's like sneeze plague
176000	179000	It's like when my nose started feeling like burning after that
179000	182000	I'm like, ugh, I hate you
182000	186000	Yeah, I had this weird thing going on where the top of my throat was getting all scratchy
186000	190000	a couple weeks ago, or no, not a couple weeks ago, it was more like last week
190000	193000	and I was like, oh crap, this is me starting to get sick
193000	198000	I started taking the emergency and the other vitamins, like loading my body with sea and zinc
198000	201000	just to try and fend it off, and I guess it worked
201000	203000	Shooting up with steroids
203000	207000	I didn't go that far, come on, I'm not Arnold Schwarzenegger
207000	213000	Anyhow, let's talk about video games as we get into another week here at OLR
213000	216000	where we talk about the gaming news, invite you guys to call us
216000	219000	and of course join us in chat at chat.orangelandrader.com
219000	220000	Speaking of the chat
220000	221000	What's that?
221000	224000	I asked Azure Edge, who said, I love bronies
224000	227000	Is that like brownies for bros?
227000	231000	Is that the My Little Brony thing that we were talking about a couple weeks ago?
231000	232000	Maybe
232000	234000	I think there's a phantom W in that
234000	237000	Unless bronies are actually like
237000	239000	That would be brow-nies
239000	244000	Brownies with bacon inside of them, you know, brownies with bacon, those would be bronies
244000	248000	A couple of my friends, they're actually sisters, they make bacon brownies
248000	254000	We are very much considering a pork party for Josh's first birthday
254000	258000	I'm serious, it's looking like it's probably going to happen
258000	263000	Tarak Sakri, you could protest, you could stand outside with your PETA sign
263000	265000	Fuck PETA
265000	269000	Here's some other fun random things real quick
269000	273000	One of the other runner-up ideas for a party
273000	277000	and we're probably thinking about this for maybe second or third year
277000	281000	and you're going to laugh, pedo bear themed
281000	284000	Why would you do that for your child?
284000	288000	Because it's funny, because our friends would know what it is, but our family doesn't know what pedo bear is
288000	292000	They think it's just a teddy bear, it would be hilarious
292000	295000	Are you going to get a bounce house and everything?
295000	296000	Maybe
296000	300000	You should get the Pikachu bounce house where you climb into Pikachu's butt
300000	305000	I think Dark Sakura should dress up as pedo bear
305000	309000	I said internet meme themed party
309000	313000	because we were trying to think of something that's not been done before
313000	314000	Pork party I think is pretty
314000	316000	You should do a troll party and make everyone wear troll masks
316000	320000	I was going to say, if you do an internet meme party, I will come as Nyan Cat
320000	325000	I will have little rainbow streamers behind me, I'll wear a pop tart
325000	329000	I think that would be funny, but maybe not this year
329000	332000	The only reason she was thinking of doing pork party
332000	336000	I guess some of her Facebook, like mommy friends or whatever
336000	339000	One of them makes cakes, and they said
339000	343000	Oh I can make a pig cake with an apple in its mouth
343000	346000	And the apple would be its own personal little cake for Josh
346000	351000	Little known fact about me, my uncle is actually a pig farmer
351000	356000	They have a ranch out in the not so city part of Sacramento
356000	358000	Like out in the valley a little more
358000	364000	They actually have a little ranch out there where they raise pigs to be sold for food basically
364000	366000	For all those pickled pigs feet
366000	373000	And it's kind of sick because we used to go there for Easter and Christmas and all the holidays
373000	378000	And I was younger, and man we would just have a feast of bacon and all that stuff
378000	382000	And it didn't really hit me until much later in life
382000	385000	Oh god, it was kind of
385000	386000	Sad
386000	388000	I'm gonna take some bacon outside for the pigs
388000	390000	We used to go out to the barn and look at the baby pigs
390000	392000	It was like, oh it's cute the baby pigs
392000	394000	And we'd come in and just feast on ham
394000	397000	And now I'm realizing like, god that was kind of messed up
397000	400000	Ham, okay even when I did eat pork
400000	403000	Ham has always been so disgusting to me
403000	406000	It just tastes like, not right
406000	408000	Okay I promise we'll get into video games here in a minute
408000	410000	But I have to say about like ham
410000	412000	I gotta say I am a ham person
412000	414000	I like the honey baked hams, those are my favorite
414000	419000	But for Thanksgiving, I really don't like turkey
419000	421000	I am not a turkey person
421000	423000	I always get my own drumstick
423000	425000	My mother's very kind in that she always makes a ham
425000	427000	Which is funny because I have two brothers
427000	429000	And we would always fight over them
429000	431000	So I'd just say fine, neither of you can have them
431000	434000	I'd wrap them up and put it in the fridge
434000	438000	Alright, video games, quickly before we get into gaming weeks
438000	442000	I want to do a quick follow up to a story from last week
442000	444000	It's not on the show roll anywhere
444000	446000	I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf who of course
446000	449000	As he has been for many many many many weeks
449000	453000	Is on before us as we do tape live every Sunday night at allgames.com
453000	455000	At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
455000	457000	Right after Bobby's show
457000	459000	One of the things he was talking about on his 300th episode
459000	461000	Grats on the ding by the way
461000	465000	He was talking about the whole update to the Nintendo games
465000	469000	Supposedly, as we reported on last week or the week before
469000	471000	Are not coming to the US
471000	473000	Because Nintendo just has no interest in those games at that time
473000	475000	There's this whole Operation Rainfall
475000	477000	That's trying to get the games localized
477000	479000	Well apparently there's some mole within Nintendo
479000	481000	That reported to Operation Rainfall that
481000	483000	Yeah, these games are coming
483000	485000	It's just a very hush thing right now
485000	487000	Which leads me to believe that
487000	489000	You hit the nail on the head last week, Loki
489000	491000	When Reggie's gonna come out
491000	493000	It may not be in XD3, it could be like the holiday
493000	495000	It'll be in XD3
495000	496000	You think all the way to XD3?
496000	498000	I think it's XD3 because localization doesn't take that long
498000	502000	And because they want to have something saying
502000	505000	Hey, you know, we haven't forgotten about you
505000	507000	Because the whole point is they're gonna try to
507000	509000	Let the hardcore gamers know
509000	511000	We haven't forgotten about you
511000	513000	That's why you need to buy our new system
513000	516000	So, I mean, granted, those are Wii games
516000	518000	But they still play on the new Wii U system
518000	520000	But that's kind of the whole theme
520000	521000	They're gonna be trying
521000	523000	Because they need that hardcore crowd
523000	525000	Because the casual gamer doesn't give a shit about their new system
525000	529000	I mean, eventually they will because of the touchscreen thing
529000	532000	But it's gonna be convincing these people
532000	534000	That really bought the system for Wii Sports
534000	537000	And Wii Sports Resort and maybe Mario Kart or something like that
537000	539000	Why they need to go out and buy another system
539000	542000	Well, I mean, Nintendo doesn't just have to have
542000	544000	One press conference a year, though
544000	546000	I don't see anything stopping Nintendo from
546000	548000	Thinking again what you said last week about
548000	550000	They'll come out and say
550000	552000	Except you said it a lot more angry
552000	555000	You know, the fans demanded it and here it is
555000	557000	You know, there's no reason they couldn't do this big thing
557000	560000	At Nintendo World in New York City
560000	562000	Where they'll have a big press conference
562000	564000	And invite people to play the games in for the first time
564000	566000	Because it's what you the gamer wanted
566000	568000	And we listened because we're the company that
568000	570000	Loves our fans
570000	572000	They're just
572000	574000	I mean, I don't know
574000	577000	They could have easily phrased it away without
577000	580000	Because what's the point in saying, you know
580000	582000	Why even say
582000	584000	No, it's not something that we're working on right now
584000	586000	Here's an important point from Dark Tetsuya
586000	588000	In our chatroom at chat.orangesonsready.com
588000	590000	C goes back to when they said
590000	592000	Not at this time
592000	594000	Is it possible that the intern that updates Facebook
594000	596000	Perhaps just, you know, had to say something
596000	598000	But realized they couldn't exactly
598000	600000	Spoil an upcoming press conference
600000	602000	No, they don't have to say anything
602000	604000	And if it is E3
604000	606000	Why do they even have to say anything
606000	608000	I mean, let's put it this way
608000	610000	They went out during E3
610000	612000	And said, hey, we're gonna work on a Smash Bros game
612000	616000	I mean, we haven't started working on a Smash Bros game yet
616000	618000	But we will eventually work on
618000	620000	I mean, if they're gonna announce stuff
620000	622000	That we will eventually work on
622000	624000	Versus something that they maybe
624000	626000	Just started working on or something that they're planning on
626000	628000	Why can't they say, hey, you know what fans
628000	630000	You're right, we are gonna be
630000	632000	Bringing these games over to
632000	634000	North America, stay tuned for more information
634000	636000	That's all they had to do
636000	638000	People wouldn't have been pissed
638000	640000	They could still announce all their stuff at, you know, E3
640000	642000	And say, hey, you know what, we heard you guys
642000	644000	Without looking like complete assholes
644000	646000	At the same time
646000	648000	But no, they decided, hey, we're just gonna say
648000	650000	No, we don't have any plans to do that
650000	652000	And then everyone gets pissed off at them
652000	654000	I kinda think the intern just did what they had to do
654000	656000	And, you know
656000	658000	Well, then they should come out
658000	660000	They have an opportunity to update at any time
660000	662000	Hey, you know what, word is actually
662000	664000	We are gonna be bringing these over
664000	666000	You know, stay tuned for more details
666000	668000	Now, here's a thought from
668000	670000	Black Wolf, who's in our chat room
670000	672000	And I actually think this is a great idea
672000	674000	How about PAX?
674000	676000	Reggie comes out at PAX and says, here's your game, bitches
676000	678000	And Breakman follows that up with
678000	680000	Then he bitch slaps everyone
680000	682000	But are they doing any
682000	684000	Sort of press conference at PAX?
684000	686000	PAX doesn't usually have press conferences
686000	688000	But PAX, they will probably have a presence
688000	690000	On the show floor, usually the Washington
690000	692000	Cause PAX is up in Seattle
692000	694000	At the time anyway
694000	696000	And they're right in the backyard of Microsoft and Nintendo
696000	698000	So there's no reason
698000	700000	I remember the one year we all went to PAX
700000	702000	I believe that had been the first time that
702000	704000	Animal Crossing was shown out on the floor
704000	706000	I don't think it had made E3 that year
706000	708000	My memory is a little bit fuzzy
708000	710000	But I seem to remember there was something on the floor that year
710000	712000	That actually was new for Nintendo
712000	714000	That they had not shown at E3
714000	716000	And PAX being the whole fan service
716000	718000	Expo, and you know
718000	720000	Delivering what the fans want
720000	722000	Would actually seem like
722000	724000	The perfect idea
724000	726000	I think that's a great idea from Bobby
726000	728000	The only thing that I think
728000	730000	Might be a little bit, maybe not
730000	732000	Is that it's a little soon
732000	734000	But it could also kind of add up to this bigger equation
734000	736000	That maybe Nintendo wanted to make
736000	738000	E3 all about
738000	740000	You know, these games
740000	742000	And they want to make PAX about the other stuff
742000	744000	It sounds like PAX would make more sense because
744000	746000	If they're localizing this stuff for Europe already
746000	748000	Localizing it for the United States
748000	750000	North America is
750000	752000	I mean, they've already done all the voice and
752000	754000	Translation work
754000	756000	I don't think that they really need to do anything
756000	758000	I think all they have to worry about is the NTSC versus PAL
758000	760000	That's the stuff they have to worry about
760000	762000	Not just rendering, I mean that
762000	764000	High def, it doesn't matter anyways
764000	766000	Or 480p
766000	768000	It's the Wii
768000	770000	It doesn't matter, okay, let me put it this way
770000	772000	Your Wii will interpret it any way
772000	774000	It doesn't matter
774000	776000	I don't know
776000	778000	They could have done it in a more
778000	780000	You know
780000	782000	Polite way without ruining any surprises
782000	784000	I mean, they could just say, stay tuned for more details
784000	786000	And they'll be like, oh, here it is
786000	788000	It just wouldn't surprise me if there's that whole
788000	790000	Corporate, you know, like
790000	792000	We make the plan in January
792000	794000	Of 2011 for
794000	796000	Here's the marketing for the entire year
796000	798000	And we're going to announce this game
798000	800000	At this expo and this, and we have a tight calendar
800000	802000	Of who's going to what expo to show, what game
802000	804000	You know, this stuff is just mapped out a year in advance
804000	806000	And the interns know
806000	808000	That update Facebook, I better stick to
808000	810000	The schedule, you know, I can't
810000	812000	Or they may not even know themselves
812000	814000	But as we're going to get into more information
814000	816000	That's not true
816000	818000	We know that's not true, they've come out and said that
818000	820000	That's not true because of certain factors that play into
820000	822000	Certain things
822000	824000	And you can't just stick to a strict schedule
824000	826000	Anyways, because you don't know what's going to happen
826000	828000	I guess that's true
828000	830000	And if you have a bunch of people that are rabid fans over something
830000	832000	And you are planning on doing this
832000	834000	With a bone or something like that to keep them interested
834000	836000	So they're not thinking, oh well, Nintendo's abandoned
836000	838000	Me, you know, well screw them
838000	840000	I'm going to move on
840000	842000	And, I mean
842000	844000	I don't know
844000	846000	Alright, let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about
846000	848000	The video games we have been playing this week
848000	850000	The stuff that has been released in America
850000	852000	Unless you guys are playing import games this week
852000	854000	Which is certainly possible
854000	856000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
856000	858000	It was a little more eventful
858000	860000	I played that game that you sent me
860000	862000	Terrarium
862000	864000	Terraria I think
864000	866000	It's pretty
866000	868000	It's pretty fun so far
868000	870000	But it's still Horizontal Minecraft
870000	872000	I dug a lot of holes
872000	874000	And died a lot
874000	876000	And popped slimes with pickaxe
876000	878000	I played some WoW
878000	880000	One
880000	882000	Item level
882000	884000	Stupid Firelands
884000	886000	What else did I do?
886000	888000	I played Portal 2
888000	890000	Some more today
890000	892000	And I played Droplets the other night
892000	894000	What do you do in Portal 2
894000	896000	On all your replays
896000	898000	Are you going through for achievements
898000	900000	Or are you just trying to get your speed better
900000	902000	I've done all of the single player achievements
902000	904000	Except for one of the speed levels
904000	906000	But mostly I just go through
906000	908000	Because it's fun
908000	910000	I just keep playing it
910000	912000	I like watching your favorite movie
912000	914000	I played
914000	916000	Some Doom 2
916000	918000	That's kind of random
918000	920000	Yeah it's not
920000	922000	As good as I remember
922000	924000	But it's still fun
924000	926000	I still remember a lot of my cheats
926000	928000	IDGAF
928000	930000	IDGAF
930000	932000	IDKFA
932000	934000	You know
934000	936000	I just remember in Doom
936000	938000	When you could make the screen
938000	940000	You could adjust the screen size
940000	942000	To get your computer to render it better
942000	944000	For older systems
944000	946000	My 386 or my 486 100
946000	948000	I don't even remember it so long ago
948000	950000	I had to put the window at the minimum size
950000	952000	To get it to run decently
952000	954000	It was this little tiny window on my screen
954000	956000	It's like trying to play a Game Boy
956000	958000	On my computer screen
958000	960000	I just always remember liking the
960000	962000	Names of the levels like Hurt Me Plenty
962000	964000	And all that
964000	966000	That was my favorite one
968000	970000	I found out that I can't play Hexen anymore
970000	972000	I really can't
972000	974000	Which is the motion sickness of the first person
974000	976000	No it's just not great anymore
976000	978000	Aww how sad
978000	980000	I know but I still remember my codes for that too
980000	982000	Like God Mode was Satan
982000	984000	And NRA
984000	986000	Was all weapons
986000	988000	Are you picking up these games
988000	990000	For Steam sale?
990000	992000	Well I already had Hexen
992000	994000	But I picked up the Doom Pack
994000	996000	I'm so mad I missed that
996000	998000	The Doom Pack was 8 bucks
998000	1000000	I missed the Quake Pack when it was on sale
1000000	1002000	Yeah it's probably still a good deal
1002000	1004000	At 20 bucks but there's just something about the whole
1004000	1006000	You're getting it at a really good deal
1006000	1008000	Steam sales are so dangerous
1008000	1010000	I'm telling you when we get to my gaming week
1010000	1012000	I wish I put out all the sim stuff cheap
1012000	1014000	Just wait Rob
1014000	1016000	I'm sure it'll go on sale again once Rage comes out
1016000	1018000	Oh it will I'm sure
1018000	1020000	I'll wait for the sale
1020000	1022000	I have plenty to hold me over
1022000	1024000	For months
1024000	1026000	Anyhow Dark Soccer
1026000	1028000	Well I tried to play DAC again
1028000	1030000	I check DAC
1030000	1032000	And I always keep forgetting that I need a controller to play it
1032000	1034000	So I'm like
1034000	1036000	Just grab one of the Xbox controllers one day
1036000	1038000	There you go
1038000	1040000	Alright
1040000	1042000	Loki! How was your gaming week?
1042000	1044000	I didn't play a whole lot
1044000	1046000	It was mainly just Grand Theft Auto this week
1046000	1048000	Rockstar Games decided to finally
1048000	1050000	After I don't know how many years
1050000	1052000	Well a couple years now
1052000	1054000	To patch the mods again for Grand Theft Auto
1054000	1056000	Now they didn't patch everything
1056000	1058000	They patched it kind of like the way they did with 4wares
1058000	1060000	Mainly everything that
1060000	1062000	I mean most of the things that you could use
1062000	1064000	I guess to grief other players
1064000	1066000	Like they patched all the weapon mods
1066000	1068000	And
1068000	1070000	Some other random stuff which is kind of lame
1070000	1072000	But I still can do like vehicle mods
1072000	1074000	If we wanted to and the map mods
1074000	1076000	Which is kind of cool because I'm still working on something for that
1076000	1078000	So
1078000	1080000	We went back to playing regular
1080000	1082000	Ballad of Gay Tony Deathmatch
1082000	1084000	Again and I'm trying to work my way
1084000	1086000	Up the leaderboards again
1086000	1088000	Since I haven't played in a while
1088000	1090000	And a lot more people are playing my ranks drop
1090000	1092000	Pretty significantly but
1092000	1094000	Still you know
1094000	1096000	Out of like 200,000
1096000	1098000	Plus players you know being like
1098000	1100000	85 is not bad
1100000	1102000	So
1102000	1104000	You know just still working on getting
1104000	1106000	Up there
1106000	1108000	I was at one point trying to beat this
1108000	1110000	Player named Chuck Norris just because it would be funny
1110000	1112000	Because you know you have to defeat Chuck Norris
1112000	1114000	But now he's gone so
1114000	1116000	Chevy Chase
1116000	1118000	I'm after you
1120000	1122000	A little bit of Earth Defense Force
1122000	1124000	And
1124000	1126000	That was pretty much it this week really didn't play a whole lot
1126000	1128000	Alright
1128000	1130000	My gaming week
1130000	1132000	Let's see I
1132000	1134000	I found that Steam sale
1134000	1136000	To be very dangerous that whole thing that they're doing
1136000	1138000	This week and I have easily dropped
1138000	1140000	40 to 50 dollars
1140000	1142000	On games which is exactly what they want
1142000	1144000	People to do that's the whole trick behind it
1144000	1146000	Man I got to say I picked up a lot of good stuff
1146000	1148000	So here's some of the stuff I've played this week
1148000	1150000	One of my favorites
1150000	1152000	And it's one of those things where I've known
1152000	1154000	About this game for the longest time and I hear
1154000	1156000	Good things about it and I just for whatever
1156000	1158000	Reason have never played it I'm just
1158000	1160000	Too busy playing WoW or something on the
1160000	1162000	Xbox or what have you and I always
1162000	1164000	Neglect to look at this game but I finally picked up
1164000	1166000	Beat Hazard which is
1166000	1168000	A game that's available on Steam and it's on sale
1168000	1170000	There's this whole combo pack going on
1170000	1172000	Right now where it's Beat Hazard, Ultra
1172000	1174000	And all this other stuff
1174000	1176000	Basically in a nutshell imagine if
1176000	1178000	Like Geometry Wars
1178000	1180000	Kind of met a game where you
1180000	1182000	Could put your own music
1182000	1184000	In and then add
1184000	1186000	Super seizure robots to the whole thing
1186000	1188000	That's what Beat Hazard is
1188000	1190000	Look I usually
1190000	1192000	Am not the photo sensitive type and
1192000	1194000	You know I don't usually have reactions
1194000	1196000	To video games but I got to say in playing
1196000	1198000	Beat Hazard I seriously think
1198000	1200000	I felt a little odd playing
1200000	1202000	It like I was like you know I'm not usually
1202000	1204000	Prone to this type of stuff but this game is gonna
1204000	1206000	Do it like if any game is gonna set me
1206000	1208000	Off and cause me to have a seizure it's probably
1208000	1210000	Gonna be this game
1210000	1212000	If you haven't played the game you know
1212000	1214000	You're this little ship and the way it controls
1214000	1216000	Is kind of interesting on the computer because
1216000	1218000	You use your mouse to target
1218000	1220000	Things and use the button to shoot
1220000	1222000	On your mouse but you use WASD
1222000	1224000	To move your ship so it's kind of a neat
1224000	1226000	Little control system you know it takes the place
1226000	1228000	Of two thumb sticks which you know I'm sure
1228000	1230000	You would use if I plugged in a controller but I
1230000	1232000	Kind of like the whole WASD and using
1232000	1234000	Your mouse to shoot and
1234000	1236000	Basically you can load your own
1236000	1238000	MP3's or iTunes songs
1238000	1240000	Or you can use like the 20 some
1240000	1242000	Odd songs that are just a part of the game by
1242000	1244000	Default all kind of techno
1244000	1246000	Trancy Ravey songs or
1246000	1248000	You can play the Lady Gaga songs like I did which is
1248000	1250000	Actually a lot of fun and the
1250000	1252000	Ships kind of
1252000	1254000	I guess are generated based on the music
1254000	1256000	But the speed is kind of
1256000	1258000	Driven by the music and most
1258000	1260000	Importantly kind of the pulse
1260000	1262000	Of the bullets and the background
1262000	1264000	And everything is driven by the beats of the game
1264000	1266000	And a lot of your power ups are based around
1266000	1268000	Volume you can the
1268000	1270000	Basically the more powerful you are the louder
1270000	1272000	The song gets which is kind of cool
1272000	1274000	So yeah you know for
1274000	1276000	About I think I paid about
1276000	1278000	Like six bucks for the whole thing I don't
1278000	1280000	It was a pretty good deal so
1280000	1282000	Very happy with that
1282000	1284000	Some of the other games I've bought
1284000	1286000	During this sale
1286000	1288000	Arkon I had no
1288000	1290000	Idea that the classic 80's
1290000	1292000	Commodore 64 slash
1292000	1294000	NES game Arkon was
1294000	1296000	Now on PC until
1296000	1298000	I
1298000	1300000	Believe it was Travis
1300000	1302000	From under sedation live
1302000	1304000	Mentioned it to me on Twitter that
1304000	1306000	Arkon was available on the iPhone
1306000	1308000	And I was like oh snap there's like this
1308000	1310000	Whole iPhone game out there and it kind of had me thinking
1310000	1312000	If they've done it for the iPhone I wonder if there's a new
1312000	1314000	PC version so I searched for Arkon
1314000	1316000	Arkon on Steam and sure enough
1316000	1318000	A brand new Arkon game has been released
1318000	1320000	And I'm like just mind blown
1320000	1322000	How long has this game been out
1322000	1324000	And I didn't even know about it and I used to love this game
1324000	1326000	Back in the day so I bought the new one and I haven't
1326000	1328000	Played enough of it yet where I could really tell you a lot
1328000	1330000	About it but I will say
1330000	1332000	I played through at least the tutorial mode
1332000	1334000	And it's definitely the old school Arkon
1334000	1336000	I'm just hoping there's the online
1336000	1338000	Play and all that I haven't again I've played
1338000	1340000	Like maybe 15 minutes of this
1340000	1342000	Before I got distracted with something else
1342000	1344000	So I'll try to play more over the next week
1344000	1346000	And what have you
1346000	1348000	Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelaunge.com
1348000	1350000	Kaijuto says
1350000	1352000	Beat Hazard will blow your eye sockets
1352000	1354000	I played the demo and it almost
1354000	1356000	Killed me now to be fair
1356000	1358000	You can turn down the intensity
1358000	1360000	Of the effects but who wants
1360000	1362000	To do that
1362000	1364000	I will say this as well
1364000	1366000	One thing I love about Beat Hazard
1366000	1368000	Is that there's just
1368000	1370000	For what is a pretty simple concept
1370000	1372000	They've poured a lot of
1372000	1374000	Replayability factors into the game
1374000	1376000	In the way of like power-ups
1376000	1378000	And achievements
1378000	1380000	Like the more you level through
1380000	1382000	And the more songs you play
1382000	1384000	You get power-ups
1384000	1386000	That you can permanently buy for your ship
1386000	1388000	And then you can you know pick
1388000	1390000	Like five of the power-ups for your ship for a song
1390000	1392000	And a lot of times what the power-ups
1392000	1394000	Do is they do things to your ship to increase
1394000	1396000	Either survivability or score
1396000	1398000	So if you're the type that wants to go for the
1398000	1400000	Highest score possible amongst your friends
1400000	1402000	You use the
1402000	1404000	Enhancements that you unlock the more you play
1404000	1406000	To get that and I just think
1406000	1408000	That's kind of a neat way to do it
1408000	1410000	And what kind of really enhances
1410000	1412000	The playability of what's otherwise a
1412000	1414000	Very simple game
1414000	1416000	I was gifted Plants vs. Zombies
1416000	1418000	By our listener
1418000	1420000	XLink who was on Horde House a couple weeks ago
1420000	1422000	It's kind of like a late birthday present
1422000	1424000	And finally
1424000	1426000	I know Dark Soccer is a huge fan of Plants vs. Zombies
1426000	1427000	Yes I am
1427000	1428000	And I've played the game before
1428000	1430000	I've played the free one online but
1430000	1432000	Now I have the PC version and I was playing that
1432000	1434000	For a little bit and perfecting
1434000	1436000	My strategy against zombies I didn't realize
1436000	1438000	There was a whole little mode where you could create
1438000	1440000	Your own zombie and then like that zombie
1440000	1442000	Will show up in the final wave as you play the game
1442000	1444000	Oh that was kind of cool
1444000	1446000	I think if you do more than one though both of them can show up
1446000	1448000	Oh really? I always did the one
1448000	1450000	Not the point of it at first was just to make
1450000	1452000	A little
1452000	1454000	Avatar that you could use on
1454000	1456000	Instant Messenger or on web forums and stuff
1456000	1458000	Which is actually a really smart idea
1458000	1460000	To try and get the game exposed
1460000	1462000	And I'm surprised more people haven't kind of hopped
1462000	1464000	On that train where like
1464000	1466000	Let people make a custom avatar from your game
1466000	1468000	Which
1468000	1470000	Okay now I'm sounding kind of stupid because that's what
1470000	1472000	The Xbox 360 avatar stuff is all about
1472000	1474000	But I guess this is the first time I've kind of seen it in a PC
1474000	1476000	Fashion and kind of let them
1476000	1478000	Spread the word about the game
1478000	1480000	Like I think it would be a great idea for like the next Elder Scrolls game
1480000	1482000	On PC to do is let me make a little
1482000	1484000	Avatar on my character and then I could use it on
1484000	1486000	Web forums and stuff I don't know
1486000	1488000	Something like that
1488000	1490000	That's kind of neat I hope they have something like that for Saints Bros. III
1490000	1492000	Because they know they're going to be putting out their
1492000	1494000	Character creator slightly early before the game
1494000	1496000	That would be kind of cool to have
1496000	1498000	You know
1498000	1500000	Your character on the avatar
1500000	1502000	So I've bought some games see here's the other
1502000	1504000	Dangerous thing about the Steam sale
1504000	1506000	I've bought games I haven't even freaking
1506000	1508000	Played yet and one of the games I
1508000	1510000	Bought was Amnesia
1510000	1512000	Which is supposed to be just like
1512000	1514000	A horrifically
1514000	1516000	Scary game like I was even
1516000	1518000	Scared by the trailer
1518000	1520000	It's like seriously like a scare the pants
1520000	1522000	Off of you game don't play this in the dark
1522000	1524000	Type of thing so I'm excited
1524000	1526000	To check out Amnesia do you know much about this game
1526000	1528000	Dark Soccer because you like the survival horror stuff
1528000	1530000	Go look at the trailer on there for Amnesia
1530000	1532000	You have to tell me if you think it's scary
1532000	1534000	Or not so alright
1534000	1536000	That's all I'll say about my
1536000	1538000	Gaming week otherwise it's been the other stuff
1538000	1540000	Final Fantasy 13
1540000	1542000	I think I'm up to like 30
1542000	1544000	Hours 35 hours spent
1544000	1546000	In the game I think I'm getting
1546000	1548000	Closer to the end I'm still in chapter 11
1548000	1550000	Because I've been doing crap ton of sidequests
1550000	1552000	But getting
1552000	1554000	Closer to the end I'm back in the main story now
1554000	1556000	I'm climbing a big tower for those
1556000	1558000	Of you that know the game and probably
1558000	1560000	Ring a bell to some of you
1560000	1562000	Are you running up that hill?
1562000	1564000	Yes I'm running up that hill
1564000	1566000	To make a deal with a foul C
1566000	1568000	And convince them to swap our places
1568000	1570000	Let's see
1570000	1572000	And then you know Warcraft
1572000	1574000	And all that other fun stuff alright
1574000	1576000	That's it for my gaming week

1602000	1604000	All games dot com I need to give a shout out as well
1604000	1606000	This is important we just celebrated
1606000	1608000	A big anniversary a couple weeks ago our 9th
1608000	1610000	Anniversary but next week on
1610000	1612000	All games radio or this Saturday
1612000	1614000	Depending on when you're listening
1614000	1616000	July 16th
1616000	1618000	Is the 10th anniversary
1618000	1620000	Of under sedation live
1620000	1622000	Which is a show that's been on Saturday nights
1622000	1624000	On all games for quite some time
1624000	1626000	It was a show I co-hosted
1626000	1628000	Before o-l-r and through
1628000	1630000	About the first 6 months to year
1630000	1632000	Of o-l-r I was actually doing a show on Saturday
1632000	1634000	And a show on Sunday for quite some time
1634000	1636000	I had no life on the weekends
1636000	1638000	But the show has changed and gone through
1638000	1640000	Some different host line ups and so forth
1640000	1642000	But what's funny is it's kind of back
1642000	1644000	To a very classic line up it's Travis and Jessica
1644000	1646000	And kind of one of the earliest
1646000	1648000	Line ups of under sedation live was myself
1648000	1650000	Travis and Jessica so
1650000	1652000	The show is just missing me but I'm going to be back
1652000	1654000	On Saturday
1654000	1656000	To say hello for the 10th anniversary
1656000	1658000	Happy 10th anniversary
1658000	1660000	And I know it's just going to be Travis dogging me
1660000	1662000	For 3 hours but
1662000	1664000	That's ok we gave him a little fodder
1664000	1666000	He's not great
1666000	1668000	After 10 years of hard work I
1668000	1670000	Suppose he's earned it
1670000	1672000	But
1672000	1674000	Not that I'm going to go
1674000	1676000	Quietly that's what I'm going to say about
1676000	1678000	That I'm a lot bitchier now
1678000	1680000	Than I was 10 years ago
1680000	1682000	No seriously though it'll be fun
1682000	1684000	So check that out Saturday night at all
1684000	1686000	Games radio more information understationlive.org
1686000	1688000	Now we can get into some gaming
1688000	1690000	News let's talk about what's going on in the
1690000	1692000	Gaming industry this week and get your thoughts
1692000	1694000	Live in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com
1694000	1696000	And on the skype line later on
1696000	1698000	Loki start us off
1698000	1700000	Ah yes square enix was a little bit sad
1700000	1702000	After their game Deus Ex
1702000	1704000	Human Revolution has
1704000	1706000	Been leaked out to
1706000	1708000	The public
1708000	1710000	Apparently preview code for the game
1710000	1712000	Which was hosted on steam
1712000	1714000	The account was hacked
1714000	1716000	It was a game preview
1716000	1718000	Code meant for
1718000	1720000	People in the
1720000	1722000	Preview review program
1722000	1724000	Kind of for the press
1724000	1726000	And one of the outlets I guess
1726000	1728000	It's a french outlet
1728000	1730000	And their account got hacked
1730000	1732000	And this game was downloaded
1732000	1734000	And then of course it spread out there
1734000	1736000	Kind of like wildfire
1736000	1738000	Right now they're going after 15
1738000	1740000	Unnamed John Does and seeking
1740000	1742000	Monetary damage in excess of
1742000	1744000	$5,000 for the
1744000	1746000	Preview's distribution
1746000	1748000	Now the game wasn't finished
1748000	1750000	But it was kind of a preview build
1750000	1752000	That leaked out there
1752000	1754000	And obviously this is not the first time
1754000	1756000	Something like this has happened
1756000	1758000	This is 2, same thing happened to that
1758000	1760000	And god how many other games
1760000	1762000	Preview builds get leaked out for
1762000	1764000	A lot
1764000	1766000	But they're none too happy about that
1766000	1768000	Interesting
1768000	1770000	Um
1770000	1772000	Steam's supposed to be like
1772000	1774000	The super secure thing
1774000	1776000	And it's interesting that the game
1776000	1778000	Kind of leaked off of it
1778000	1780000	When it sounds like this might be more
1780000	1782000	Of like an error
1782000	1784000	Or some sort
1784000	1786000	It was an Italian gaming outlet
1786000	1788000	That leaked that out
1788000	1790000	Or that the account got hacked from
1790000	1792000	Not Steam then to clarify
1792000	1794000	It seems to be kind of
1794000	1796000	Confusing where it's come from
1796000	1798000	It seems that even Square doesn't know yet
1798000	1800000	Rather than aim its suit at the
1800000	1802000	Italian gaming outlet
1802000	1804000	The Japanese publisher is instead
1804000	1806000	Directing its legal team at the 15
1806000	1808000	People that stole the game
1808000	1810000	Or I guess that are
1810000	1812000	Distributing the game
1812000	1814000	It takes 15 people to
1814000	1816000	Download a game
1816000	1818000	They don't know who they are because it's gonna be 15 IP addresses
1818000	1820000	Pretty much, yeah
1820000	1822000	What do you think
1822000	1824000	About a case like this? Do you think Square
1824000	1826000	Has a case against these folks?
1826000	1828000	If they can track them down
1828000	1830000	Because they hacked into someone's account
1830000	1832000	So the crime that's committed
1832000	1834000	Is impersonating someone else's account
1834000	1836000	To get the game
1836000	1838000	We'll see
1838000	1840000	But what if those people come back and say
1840000	1842000	I don't have my IP
1842000	1844000	I wasn't driving
1844000	1846000	Somebody hacked into my Wi-Fi
1846000	1848000	That's the problem
1848000	1850000	Because it is the burden of proof
1850000	1852000	They need to have the proof that they did it
1852000	1854000	And just seeing that you have your IP
1854000	1856000	People can spoof IPs easy
1856000	1858000	Especially if they're smart
1858000	1860000	If these people are
1860000	1862000	The smart hacker types
1862000	1864000	Obviously they're gonna be running their
1864000	1866000	IP through proxies and stuff like that
1866000	1868000	So it'll be even more difficult to track them down
1868000	1870000	I gotta ask you about this
1870000	1872000	Not to get too tangent-y
1872000	1874000	But since you brought up the whole IP spoofing
1874000	1876000	It made me think of this, a big article I read this week
1876000	1878000	What do you think about this whole
1878000	1880000	Agreement that I'm hearing
1880000	1882000	That was passed this week between the major
1882000	1884000	ISPs including
1884000	1886000	Comcast, AT&T, and a bunch of the other big ones
1886000	1888000	And copyright holders, essentially
1888000	1890000	Where there's the whole
1890000	1892000	We are going to
1892000	1894000	Notify users when IPs are identified
1894000	1896000	But if it's
1896000	1898000	Which is kind of what was already being done
1898000	1900000	But now I think it's more streamlined
1900000	1902000	And consistent between all the companies
1902000	1904000	And if a user
1904000	1906000	Keeps ignoring the alerts
1906000	1908000	They will get pop-ups that they have to
1908000	1910000	Acknowledge
1910000	1912000	Or they might even get phone calls at some point
1912000	1914000	I don't know, I haven't obviously read too far into this
1914000	1916000	I don't know, what do you think
1916000	1918000	About this whole thing?
1918000	1920000	Well, there's a couple things that are
1920000	1922000	Weird about it
1922000	1924000	One, it would have to be
1924000	1926000	The way I understood it was
1926000	1928000	I believe
1928000	1930000	It's going to be like, for example, if you were
1930000	1932000	Downloading TV episodes or something like that
1932000	1934000	Of BitTorrent or something, and they figured out
1934000	1936000	That you were doing it, or your IP
1936000	1938000	Was attached to it, they would notify you
1938000	1940000	To make sure that, you know, it's not
1940000	1942000	Say, someone
1942000	1944000	Jumping onto your Wi-Fi or something like that
1944000	1946000	They would notify you
1946000	1948000	That that's going on, if you ignore
1948000	1950000	That, and then they keep sending you
1950000	1952000	Notices and eventually, you know, they will start
1952000	1954000	Throttling your internet and whatnot
1954000	1956000	But the problem is
1956000	1958000	I don't think that actual Comcast
1958000	1960000	Or something like that are monitoring traffic
1960000	1962000	I mean, it would be very difficult for them to figure out
1962000	1964000	What you're downloading
1964000	1966000	Well, the copyright holders will
1966000	1968000	I'm assuming that what they do
1968000	1970000	Is they seek out the
1970000	1972000	Torrent, and they download it
1972000	1974000	And they can see all the IPs that are sharing it
1974000	1976000	And so they send
1976000	1978000	Requests to the ISPs
1978000	1980000	Of all those IP addresses
1980000	1982000	So, I mean, you can
1982000	1984000	There's a way
1984000	1986000	That you can get around with them
1986000	1988000	Tracking where you're actually browsing
1988000	1990000	But for one, using
1990000	1992000	A DNS that's not
1992000	1994000	Provided by your ISP
1994000	1996000	You can use 4221
1996000	1998000	Or whatever is one of those
1998000	2000000	You can
2000000	2002000	I think they have ways
2002000	2004000	You can even download BitTorrent
2004000	2006000	Via
2006000	2008000	Proxy or something like that
2008000	2010000	And you know what?
2010000	2012000	There's other options out there other than BitTorrent
2012000	2014000	I mean, not just BitTorrent
2014000	2016000	But there's newsgroups
2016000	2018000	And there's
2018000	2020000	Just plain straight up hosting
2020000	2022000	A file on one of the file sharing sites
2022000	2024000	Like MegaUpload or
2024000	2026000	RapidShare
2026000	2028000	MediaFire, whatever
2028000	2030000	So do you think this is going to be another case of
2030000	2032000	The piracy will just evolve like it did when Napster got shut down?
2032000	2034000	I don't think it's really
2034000	2036000	I don't think anything is really changing too much
2036000	2038000	They're starting to
2038000	2040000	They're kind of doing it to scare people
2040000	2042000	To get them saying
2042000	2044000	We're going to be watching what you're doing
2044000	2046000	But once again
2046000	2048000	And that's just if you're interested in
2048000	2050000	Stealing music or
2050000	2052000	Music or TV
2052000	2054000	Or something like that
2054000	2056000	I don't think game publishers
2056000	2058000	PC publishers are really
2058000	2060000	Going out there hunting these people down
2060000	2062000	There's a lot of stuff out there that's still going to get pirated
2062000	2064000	But you know what?
2064000	2066000	If you look at the NPA and the NPA
2066000	2068000	Two people that are backing this
2068000	2070000	Of course they're supporting it
2070000	2072000	Because all the backers you'll notice
2072000	2074000	Are just all the NPA, the RIA
2074000	2076000	And all the film
2076000	2078000	And music studios and stuff like that
2078000	2080000	You don't see any
2080000	2082000	Well the thing that surprised me most
2082000	2084000	About the law was this whole fact that
2084000	2086000	If you want to dispute it
2086000	2088000	You can, but you have to pay
2088000	2090000	$35
2090000	2092000	To have that investigated
2092000	2094000	Something about that kind of struck me as wrong
2094000	2096000	Like I don't like the fact that
2096000	2098000	You know, and granted
2098000	2100000	I try to have a secure setup in my home
2100000	2102000	And all this stuff, but there's just something about
2102000	2104000	My grandma
2104000	2106000	Who wouldn't know how to do all that stuff
2106000	2108000	Where somebody else probably set it up
2108000	2110000	For her that may not have done it
2110000	2112000	If somebody steals that wifi
2112000	2114000	She would have to pay $35
2114000	2116000	To have that investigated, something strikes me as really
2116000	2118000	Wrong about that
2118000	2120000	If any company asked me to
2120000	2122000	Pay $35, I would just drop them
2122000	2124000	Bill, yep, you know what
2124000	2126000	What if you have no other options in your neighborhood?
2126000	2128000	I have to use one particular ISP
2128000	2130000	In my neighborhood, and I have no
2130000	2132000	Other options, unless I want to go to DSL
2132000	2134000	Which I really don't want to do
2134000	2136000	I don't really know what you could do
2136000	2138000	I don't know either
2138000	2140000	That's a sticking point for me
2140000	2142000	I mean, I don't
2142000	2144000	I don't really pirate games
2144000	2146000	I don't pirate games
2146000	2148000	The last time I would ever pirate a game was
2148000	2150000	Back in the Playstation 1 days
2150000	2152000	I would do import games
2152000	2154000	I would, you know,
2154000	2156000	Download some of those online
2156000	2158000	Because I felt it was kind of unfair that if the publishers
2158000	2160000	Do not plan to release the games in this country anyway
2160000	2162000	Then what
2162000	2164000	You know, I'm not gonna pay the outrageous fees
2164000	2166000	Which at that time were like sometimes
2166000	2168000	$70, $80 to own the game
2168000	2170000	I'll leave that to collectors that want that stuff
2170000	2172000	Blink, blink
2172000	2174000	But, you know, I'm not gonna get
2174000	2176000	On a moral soapbox about it or what have you
2176000	2178000	You know, it's just the way it is
2178000	2180000	But, if I'm gonna
2180000	2182000	Download like last night's episode
2182000	2184000	Of The Voice
2184000	2186000	Like, really?
2186000	2188000	I'm gonna get
2188000	2190000	My ISP shut off over that
2190000	2192000	Like, it just kind of stinks
2192000	2194000	I don't know
2194000	2196000	A little ridiculous
2196000	2198000	If it ends up being
2198000	2200000	Where they're gonna be tracking you in a very simple
2200000	2202000	Fashion like you said, you know, where they've
2202000	2204000	Downloaded the torrent and
2204000	2206000	They do it in a way that
2206000	2208000	You know, they can see all your IPs
2208000	2210000	What's gonna end up having is a few things
2210000	2212000	One, people are just gonna stop
2212000	2214000	Listing the torrent as, you know,
2214000	2216000	The voice episode, blah, blah, blah
2216000	2218000	It'll be just some random gibberish
2218000	2220000	They're gonna start, you know,
2220000	2222000	Putting stuff behind, you know
2222000	2224000	Membership sites or something like that
2224000	2226000	Where you have to, you know,
2226000	2228000	Be a member of the site to find these torrents
2228000	2230000	Or something like that
2230000	2232000	There's ways around everything
2232000	2234000	But, you know, as soon as they figure out
2234000	2236000	What they're doing to find these people
2236000	2238000	Or whatever, there will be new programs
2238000	2240000	There will be new
2240000	2242000	Protocols, whatever, that people will develop
2242000	2244000	In order to get around it
2244000	2246000	They're already renaming torrent files
2246000	2248000	With like
2248000	2250000	Weird spaces between letters
2250000	2252000	And special characters and things
2252000	2254000	So
2254000	2256000	You know, you'd be surprised
2256000	2258000	They are going after
2258000	2260000	Like, some TV show watchers
2260000	2262000	Who was it in chat said they got a letter
2262000	2264000	About Game of Thrones? Oh, there it is, Rama
2264000	2266000	I got a notice the other week about someone in my house
2266000	2268000	Downloading Game of Thrones
2268000	2270000	Granted, that's an HBO show and HBO is a pay network
2270000	2272000	I mean, I sort of see where they
2272000	2274000	I mean, that is a huge
2274000	2276000	Because they make a lot of money off the DVD sales and so forth
2276000	2278000	So I can kind of see why they are very
2278000	2280000	Rampant about trying to block
2280000	2282000	The
2282000	2284000	Downloading of the shows, but like, the over-air networks
2284000	2286000	Is the ones that, like
2286000	2288000	And I don't know
2288000	2290000	What other extents they've gone to protect their stuff
2290000	2292000	I mean, I have nothing, I just
2292000	2294000	I hope it doesn't become that, you know
2294000	2296000	I'll say right now, I download Supernatural
2296000	2298000	Because I hate watching commercials
2298000	2300000	And so I'll just watch it on my computer
2300000	2302000	But I also own
2302000	2304000	Like, several of the box sets of the seasons anyway
2304000	2306000	Okay, because I was going to say
2306000	2308000	Devil's Advocate
2308000	2310000	Commercials are what make the TV shows free
2310000	2312000	But I also
2312000	2314000	Have the box sets
2314000	2316000	And a bunch of merchandise
2316000	2318000	I have the comics
2318000	2320000	You could probably watch them all on Netflix anyway
2320000	2322000	Probably
2322000	2324000	But, I mean, regardless
2324000	2326000	There's episodes
2326000	2328000	I believe up on WB's
2328000	2330000	Not WB, why am I saying WB?
2330000	2332000	It's a
2332000	2334000	CW
2334000	2336000	CW, yeah, on their website
2336000	2338000	So, I mean, it's not like it's a big deal
2338000	2340000	I just hate commercials
2340000	2342000	Now it's all about product placement
2342000	2344000	That's why we have more product placement games
2344000	2346000	I still watch my Doctor Who
2346000	2348000	Some of the old episodes of How I Met Your Mother
2348000	2350000	And stuff like that, where they're digitally altering them now
2350000	2352000	Where they're adding TVs and stuff in the background
2352000	2354000	With stuff on them for different movies
2354000	2356000	Yeah, there's reruns of
2356000	2358000	Some of the 2009 episodes are like that
2358000	2360000	With The Zookeeper in the background
2360000	2362000	Or
2362000	2364000	What is it, Country Strong or something like that
2364000	2366000	Huh, I hadn't heard about that
2366000	2368000	God, you
2368000	2370000	Nothing in the world would get me to go see The Zookeeper
2370000	2372000	Like, maybe if someone threatened
2372000	2374000	To kill my family
2374000	2376000	If I wouldn't go watch the movie
2376000	2378000	I guess I would have to go see the movie
2378000	2380000	You'd have to debate how much you love your family
2380000	2382000	There would be that moment of pause
2382000	2384000	But
2384000	2386000	I mean, seriously
2386000	2388000	That movie looks so awful
2388000	2390000	I can't even
2390000	2392000	Anyhow, real quick
2392000	2394000	Before we start jumping back into actual
2394000	2396000	Pertinent information
2396000	2398000	Have you seen the trailer for Jack and Juliet?
2398000	2400000	I don't think so
2400000	2402000	It's a new Adam Sandler movie where he plays
2402000	2404000	Both Jack and Jill
2404000	2406000	No, I haven't heard that
2406000	2408000	You think The Zookeeper looks bad
2408000	2410000	Uh, there
2410000	2412000	Does he have sex with himself? Because Divine did that
2412000	2414000	In the 70s
2414000	2416000	No, no, no
2416000	2418000	But it looks fucking terrible
2418000	2420000	Alright, let's get back to game stuff, sorry
2420000	2422000	How about the Wii U? Wii U
2422000	2424000	Talking about why was the Wii U
2424000	2426000	Showing, you know, a lot of folks at E3
2426000	2428000	And I think I had said this too
2428000	2430000	Who was showing what said
2430000	2432000	Nintendo, maybe Nintendo did this too early
2432000	2434000	Maybe they should have just waited until they actually had
2434000	2436000	A little bit more to show, like, I don't know, some actual
2436000	2438000	Games and not just a bunch of concepts
2438000	2440000	Well
2440000	2442000	Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo
2442000	2444000	Has said that, you know what, maybe
2444000	2446000	Nintendo did show the Wii earlier
2446000	2448000	Than they had planned due to
2448000	2450000	An increased fear
2450000	2452000	Of leaks
2452000	2454000	What do you mean fear of leaks? There were already leaks
2454000	2456000	I know, right?
2456000	2458000	But more could they have possibly leaked out about that system
2458000	2460000	Here's a quote
2460000	2462000	In the past, when Nintendo did not receive as much attention
2462000	2464000	As we do now, we did not have to worry
2464000	2466000	About the spread of our confidential information
2466000	2468000	Since it did not have any value in society
2468000	2470000	But since the Nintendo DS and the Wii
2470000	2472000	Created a social phenomenon
2472000	2474000	I like how they kind of just slipped that in there
2474000	2476000	Please
2476000	2478000	Social phenomenon
2478000	2480000	But it's actually blowing smoke up their own ass
2480000	2482000	Like, that's literally what they're doing in that statement
2482000	2484000	You know, since we
2484000	2486000	Decided that, you know, our systems
2486000	2488000	Are just revolutionizing the world
2488000	2490000	In fact, you know, we would go as far as saying
2490000	2492000	They're about to cure cancer
2492000	2494000	But, you know, hey
2494000	2496000	That's what the fans
2496000	2498000	Are saying about our system
2498000	2500000	Why doesn't he just say, thanks
2500000	2502000	To the internet? Because back in
2502000	2504000	The day, you know, you would get the word
2504000	2506000	From the Nintendo Fun Club
2506000	2508000	Or Nintendo Power, which ironically enough
2508000	2510000	Were also both Nintendo
2510000	2512000	You have to understand, because we're so awesome now
2512000	2514000	Let me show you this graphic behind me here
2514000	2516000	You see right here, we were awesome
2516000	2518000	But now we are, like, ten times as awesome
2518000	2520000	You do understand, that is
2520000	2522000	Way more awesome than we were before
2522000	2524000	Therefore, we have to show the Wii U early
2524000	2526000	Alright, look, I gotta
2526000	2528000	Let me read the rest of the statement here
2528000	2530000	Because I'm too hung up on this whole
2530000	2532000	Now, if this starts to be confusing
2532000	2534000	I have a pie chart, too
2534000	2536000	Nintendo used to have value
2536000	2538000	Nintendo now has value in society
2538000	2540000	Anyhow
2540000	2542000	Nintendo's next move
2542000	2544000	Commands great attention and
2544000	2546000	Extreme news value
2546000	2548000	Therefore, although we go to great lengths
2548000	2550000	To ensure that this will not happen
2550000	2552000	There are cases where, even if a person
2552000	2554000	Receives information under a non-disclosure agreement
2554000	2556000	The information is leaked because there is
2556000	2558000	Great temptation
2558000	2560000	Even for the Wii U, some people may be aware
2560000	2562000	If they had been checking the internet
2562000	2564000	That information with true and false rumors
2564000	2566000	Mixed together was spread on the internet before the announcement
2566000	2568000	So they kind of admit that
2568000	2570000	Yeah, some of it was out there
2570000	2572000	Therefore, as for new hardware
2572000	2574000	Even if we wanted to, it is extremely challenging
2574000	2576000	To realize the situation where a product
2576000	2578000	Is announced and then launched the next day
2578000	2580000	So, let's summarize
2580000	2582000	That quote in our own words
2582000	2584000	Because we are so fucking awesome
2584000	2586000	That everybody wants to report on our
2586000	2588000	Farts, and has reported
2588000	2590000	On our farts
2590000	2592000	We had to, you left us no choice
2592000	2594000	But to get up on the E3
2594000	2596000	Stage and fart
2596000	2598000	They didn't have to
2598000	2600000	Wii U
2600000	2602000	Wii U
2602000	2604000	Wii U
2604000	2606000	Here's the thing, they don't have to do shit
2606000	2608000	They don't have to do anything
2608000	2610000	They're succumbing to peer pressure
2610000	2612000	That's because they're farting
2612000	2614000	I mean, seriously, they don't have to do any
2614000	2616000	If people think that you're releasing a new system
2616000	2618000	You can either tell them, yeah, we're releasing a new system
2618000	2620000	Or you can just say, I'm not telling you shit
2620000	2622000	I mean, what are they gonna do?
2622000	2624000	Speculate all they want, but that's all it's gonna be
2624000	2626000	Is speculation, and you know what you need to do
2626000	2628000	Is you need to fucking clamp down on all those people
2628000	2630000	That are violating your goddamn NDA
2630000	2632000	When some press outlet says
2632000	2634000	Hey, I heard that the Wii U has a tablet
2634000	2636000	For a controller, then you tell them
2636000	2638000	Well, you ain't gonna see shit anymore
2638000	2640000	About Nintendo stuff because you violated
2640000	2642000	Your NDA, you dumbass
2642000	2644000	That's all they gotta do, oh, it's so difficult
2644000	2646000	To secure my information
2646000	2648000	Gee, if only there were a way I could
2648000	2650000	I don't know, get people to follow my NDA
2650000	2652000	Maybe if you
2652000	2654000	It's called a guillotine
2654000	2656000	It's called repercussions for people violating your NDA
2656000	2658000	That's why you have a non-disclosure agreement
2658000	2660000	Take those fuckers to court
2660000	2662000	It's in there
2662000	2664000	I mean, come on, it's like
2664000	2666000	You know
2666000	2668000	Oh, you wanna learn about the new Pokemon game?
2668000	2670000	Too bad, cause you're gonna have to wait until after retail
2670000	2672000	Was Nintendo really worried
2672000	2674000	About disappointing at E3 this year
2674000	2676000	Because, like, seriously, Reggie could've just
2676000	2678000	Reggie could've got up on stage
2678000	2680000	And just hula-hooped for 30 minutes
2680000	2682000	And there would be that analysis
2682000	2684000	On X-Play, like Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb
2684000	2686000	So, the Wii hoop
2686000	2688000	Wasn't that an interesting display
2688000	2690000	Of, you know, technology
2690000	2692000	Of pelvis shaking from someone
2692000	2694000	Who doesn't need to shake his pelvis
2694000	2696000	I give those pelvic thrusts a 4 out of 5
2696000	2698000	Rob, if they didn't talk about the Wii U
2698000	2700000	What the fuck would they have talked about
2700000	2702000	Cause, seriously, they had nothing to announce
2702000	2704000	This year, they had nothing
2704000	2706000	It was like, hey, yeah, well, we've got
2706000	2708000	No, they could've
2708000	2710000	Stretched the fuck out of those discussions
2710000	2712000	Of the Wii games that they didn't
2712000	2714000	Really show, like Rhythm Heaven
2714000	2716000	And all the stuff that we poo-poo
2716000	2718000	And would they have gotten slammed for that?
2718000	2720000	Probably, but then they could've shown the trailer
2720000	2722000	For the last story
2722000	2724000	Or Xenoblade, which we all think is happening anyway
2724000	2726000	I think most of us going into E3
2726000	2728000	Were pretty convinced that Nintendo was gonna show
2728000	2730000	The last story for an American release
2730000	2732000	Why is it so difficult if they're planning on
2732000	2734000	Working on that anyways, or they're planning on bringing that over
2734000	2736000	That they couldn't announce that
2736000	2738000	Even if, you know what, they decide, hey, you know what
2738000	2740000	We're not gonna bring it over here at some point
2740000	2742000	If they change their minds, they can do that
2742000	2744000	Games get cancelled all the time
2744000	2746000	Look at True Crime, you know, Hong Kong
2746000	2748000	There's a big ol' trailer for that during Activision's conference
2748000	2750000	You know, a couple years ago
2750000	2752000	But that game got cancelled
2752000	2754000	Yeah, it sucks that it got cancelled, but you know what
2754000	2756000	Games get cancelled, so if they decide, hey
2756000	2758000	We can announce this, but there may be a chance
2758000	2760000	That we're not gonna bring it over here
2760000	2762000	So what?
2762000	2764000	They're gonna announce, instead of saying, hey
2764000	2766000	I hear you guys like Smash Brothers
2766000	2768000	Well guess what, we're gonna work on Smash Brothers
2768000	2770000	Sometime
2770000	2772000	In the next couple years
2772000	2774000	It's like, thanks
2774000	2776000	I think
2776000	2778000	Game guru in our chat room
2778000	2780000	At chat.ownerswanttrader.com says
2780000	2782000	They could've focused on the 3DS
2782000	2784000	You know, and they kinda did for half their conference
2784000	2786000	Their conference this year was the Zelda thing
2786000	2788000	Which, that did feel like a bunch of hot air
2788000	2790000	Like, I'm sorry, but the whole Zelda thing
2790000	2792000	It's like, okay, you've been showing this game for like four years
2792000	2794000	And the whole symphony thing
2794000	2796000	And all that was really just dragging it out
2796000	2798000	Like, we know you're fucking showing the Wii U
2798000	2800000	This is just, you know
2800000	2802000	This is literally just pomp and circumstance
2802000	2804000	About how fucking great Nintendo is
2804000	2806000	But here's the great thing about Nintendo
2806000	2808000	They could've done pomp and circumstance
2808000	2810000	Like, they could've done, like, symphonic
2810000	2812000	Announcements for all those 3DS games
2812000	2814000	Like, they could've had somebody dressed up as
2814000	2816000	They could've had Rama, Black Luigi
2816000	2818000	Come out and go, hello
2818000	2820000	And look where it goes
2820000	2822000	Miyamoto with the fucking shield and sword
2822000	2824000	I mean, that's like, just like
2824000	2826000	That's the kind of crazy bat shit
2826000	2828000	Stuff that they need to be doing again
2828000	2830000	To get people excited about the games
2830000	2832000	I'm sorry, you know what
2832000	2834000	Every time I see them put out a new
2834000	2836000	Mario Kart and Animal Crossing game or something like that
2836000	2838000	I mean, really, what the fuck are they doing?
2838000	2840000	They're adding some more useless garbage
2840000	2842000	On top of these games
2842000	2844000	And then they're re-releasing them back out into the market
2844000	2846000	Or, hey, look, I know you guys wanted
2846000	2848000	Star Fox, so we're gonna give you Star Fox
2848000	2850000	That we gave you before
2850000	2852000	Awesome!
2852000	2854000	Hey, I hear you guys like Mario Brothers
2854000	2856000	We're gonna give you Mario Brothers 64 HD
2856000	2858000	Or in 3D
2858000	2860000	Thanks?
2860000	2862000	I mean, it's just
2862000	2864000	It's kind of annoying that they've got, I mean
2864000	2866000	To me, there's
2866000	2868000	I understand that, you know, there's a whole place
2868000	2870000	Where, hey, you know what, these games are good
2870000	2872000	Let's re-release them for a new generation
2872000	2874000	Or some garbage that you wanna spew
2874000	2876000	That basically, oh, well, we've run out of ideas
2876000	2878000	So we're just gonna take some of these old games
2878000	2880000	And, you know, put them back out again
2880000	2882000	We're gonna put as minimal amount of effort into them
2882000	2884000	To make them look new again, but we're gonna put them
2884000	2886000	Back out there, because this is what the fans want
2886000	2888000	You know what?
2888000	2890000	Fans
2890000	2892000	Let me just talk to you here real quick
2892000	2894000	Here's something that you can do, guess what
2894000	2896000	You know that those consoles
2896000	2898000	When people are done playing them
2898000	2900000	They're still out there
2900000	2902000	I mean, they don't just, like, evaporate
2902000	2904000	They are out there
2904000	2906000	I thought they were on the landfill in New Mexico
2906000	2908000	I know, it's so crazy
2908000	2910000	Did you know that if you wanna play
2910000	2912000	Oak Green Up Time, you don't have to spend
2912000	2914000	$299 plus, you know,
2914000	2916000	$40 for the game
2916000	2918000	Yes, I know, this is a shocker
2918000	2920000	That's not what Beyonce told me in the ad
2920000	2922000	I understand, but Beyonce's full of shit
2922000	2924000	Here's all you have to do
2924000	2926000	You can literally go out to your local
2926000	2928000	Garage sales, or
2928000	2930000	There's this website out there called eBay
2930000	2932000	Where people sell things
2932000	2934000	This is a game that Robin Williams named his daughter after
2934000	2936000	Isn't that worth $300?
2936000	2938000	Yeah, but Robin Williams is kinda crazy
2938000	2940000	Didn't you see the crazy beard?
2940000	2942000	It's starting to look like a homeless crazy beard
2942000	2944000	I see where you're going with that
2944000	2946000	It's beyond Santa Claus
2946000	2948000	So, you can go on eBay
2948000	2950000	And you can buy a Nintendo 64
2950000	2952000	And Oak Green Up Time
2952000	2954000	And guess what?
2954000	2956000	Just be careful that it's not coming from China
2956000	2958000	For a limited amount of time
2958000	2960000	It's within that $299 price range
2960000	2962000	About, I don't know,
2962000	2964000	40 other games!
2964000	2966000	And you can play it
2966000	2968000	All on your
2968000	2970000	You can buy everything on the Steam Marketplace right now
2970000	2972000	For $299
2972000	2974000	And you can play it, and yes, it won't be in 3D
2974000	2976000	But you know what?
2976000	2978000	Actually, wrong
2978000	2980000	It doesn't matter, because you know what?
2980000	2982000	You're playing with it
2982000	2984000	The way it was meant to be played on Nintendo 64
2984000	2986000	I don't understand why
2986000	2992000	That's the whole thing with the 25th anniversary collection or whatever
2992000	2994000	That $40 could have easily bought you
2994000	2996000	$40 could have bought you
2996000	2998000	We need to do a mock commercial for 3DS
2998000	3000000	Oak Green Up Time
3000000	3002000	That has the whole interspersed Robin Williams and his daughter
3002000	3004000	And I'll play the game
3004000	3006000	The way it was meant to be played
3006000	3008000	Just $1999 on eBay
3008000	3010000	It's not even $1999
3010000	3012000	I don't know
3012000	3014000	It would have been different
3014000	3016000	If it was something like
3016000	3018000	Hey, you know what?
3018000	3020000	We're going to bring out a Zelda anthology
3020000	3022000	We're going to have Zelda 1, Zelda 2
3022000	3024000	All of them on one disc
3024000	3026000	Like they kind of did for the pre-order thing for Wind Waker
3026000	3028000	It was a pre-order bonus!
3028000	3030000	Pre-order bonus!
3030000	3032000	Stuff that nowadays is just like a code for a shirt
3032000	3034000	For my character in game
3034000	3036000	Or armor that's red instead of silver
3036000	3038000	I mean
3038000	3040000	Why couldn't they just
3040000	3042000	They could sell that disc
3042000	3044000	They could easily just stuff
3044000	3046000	A couple more games on there
3046000	3048000	Put Wind Waker in the box or something like that
3048000	3050000	Cause that game hasn't been sold forever
3050000	3052000	Throw Twilight Princess back in there
3052000	3054000	Because hey, you know what?
3054000	3056000	In case someone doesn't have it
3056000	3058000	And a little bit of extra content
3058000	3060000	And holy crap, that's a great deal
3060000	3062000	And actually worth my time
3062000	3064000	And hell, you don't have to do anything to them
3064000	3066000	Because people liked the games the way they were
3066000	3068000	But no
3068000	3070000	They need an excuse for people to buy the 3DS
3070000	3072000	It's kind of a gimmicky system
3072000	3074000	And so what a better way to do that
3074000	3076000	Is to take one of their most popular Zelda games
3076000	3078000	And just put it back out there
3078000	3080000	With minimal effort
3080000	3082000	There's actually more to this whole Wii U story
3082000	3084000	Let's make it a four hour show tonight
3084000	3086000	Let's get Loki more to rant about
3088000	3091000	The Wii U apparently will not have a unified online network
3091000	3093000	Like Xbox Live or something like that
3093000	3096000	As if these kind of earlier quotes and things
3096000	3098000	Are to be read into
3098000	3100000	Reggie Fils-Aime
3100000	3102000	I guess in a recent interview with Forbes
3102000	3104000	Said that Nintendo is
3104000	3106000	Quote, creating a much more flexible system
3106000	3108000	That will allow the best approaches
3108000	3110000	By independent publishers
3110000	3112000	To come to bear
3112000	3114000	So instead of a situation where a publisher
3114000	3116000	Has their own network and wants
3116000	3118000	That to be the predominant platform
3118000	3120000	And having arguments with platform holders
3120000	3122000	We're going to welcome that
3122000	3124000	We're going to welcome that from the best and the brightest
3124000	3126000	Of the third party publishers
3126000	3128000	No, here's the way I look at that
3128000	3130000	We have no plans
3130000	3132000	We're just going to leave it up to you
3132000	3134000	I honestly am reading that as
3134000	3136000	We're looking at the third parties
3136000	3138000	To do the work for us
3138000	3140000	I'm sorry, that's what it is
3140000	3142000	I'm sure that everybody has trouble
3142000	3144000	Working with Xbox Live
3144000	3146000	To me, I don't see any publishers
3146000	3148000	Having trouble working with Xbox Live
3148000	3150000	This is funny
3150000	3152000	Because this does tie into something topical
3152000	3154000	And it's the whole EA vs. Steam thing
3154000	3156000	That's going on
3156000	3158000	That yes, I realize comes up later in the show
3158000	3160000	There's this whole thing going back and forth
3160000	3162000	With EA and Steam right now
3162000	3164000	Where Steam has forbidden the EA games
3164000	3166000	To come on the marketplace
3166000	3168000	For Steam
3168000	3170000	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that EA
3170000	3172000	Wants to have their own servers
3172000	3174000	For their own patches
3174000	3176000	And EA wants it all to themselves
3176000	3178000	And this was a big sticking point early on
3178000	3180000	With Microsoft in the early days of Xbox Live
3180000	3182000	So
3182000	3184000	Nintendo, in a way, can kind of point at that
3184000	3186000	And say, we're not being lazy
3186000	3188000	We're just doing what EA wants
3188000	3190000	No, they are being lazy, because guess what
3190000	3192000	Who did they bring out on stage?
3192000	3194000	EA. But guess what?
3194000	3196000	EA is still doing that, though
3196000	3198000	EA has their own, like, you have to sign in
3198000	3200000	Through the EA service or whatever
3200000	3202000	In order to play the EA games online
3202000	3204000	Because, remember, Project $10
3204000	3206000	That's all part of that fun stuff
3206000	3208000	And then, same with like
3208000	3210000	I think there's some other services
3210000	3212000	Ubisoft has their
3212000	3214000	Kind of thing where you have to log into
3214000	3216000	As well, but EA, I know for a fact
3216000	3218000	They have their, you know
3218000	3220000	EA games login that you have to do
3220000	3222000	So they have their own thing on top of this
3222000	3224000	The fact that they don't have a unified
3224000	3226000	Service or something like that is basically
3226000	3228000	Nintendo's way of saying, we don't
3228000	3230000	Know what we're doing. I'm sorry, I think that's kind of
3230000	3232000	What it is, because they don't want to invest time
3232000	3234000	Into some sort of service like that and have it be
3234000	3236000	Inferior. Well, they sort of, and they sort of
3236000	3238000	Brought out the guy from EA
3238000	3240000	Coincidentally enough, at E3
3240000	3242000	And I got the sense that
3242000	3244000	Like, I don't know how much
3244000	3246000	I can't remember now how much was said
3246000	3248000	About online, but I remember walking away from that
3248000	3250000	Getting the sense that, like I
3250000	3252000	Was actually asking myself for a minute, like
3252000	3254000	Is EA doing their online stuff?
3254000	3256000	Like, is EA going to be doing the online stuff?
3256000	3258000	It wasn't that at all. No, I know that's not what they
3258000	3260000	But that was, like, for a moment, that was the impression
3260000	3262000	I was getting about what was being said
3262000	3264000	Because they didn't really bring up their online stuff
3264000	3266000	All it really, to me, said is, hey look
3266000	3268000	We have EA on board, they believe in our system
3268000	3270000	And EA is, you know, one of the
3270000	3272000	Biggest publishers in the world
3272000	3274000	So, you all should believe in our system
3274000	3276000	You know, don't you
3276000	3278000	See the math? This is how you, you know
3278000	3280000	Because they believe in us, you have to believe in us
3280000	3282000	That, that's
3282000	3284000	It's right here, it's on the chalkboard
3284000	3286000	Alright, one more piece of information
3286000	3288000	On the Wii U, and that has to do with
3288000	3290000	Demos for the 3DS and Wii U
3290000	3292000	Another quote from Satoru
3292000	3294000	Iwata in a conversation with investors
3294000	3296000	Quote, when Nintendo would like to ask
3296000	3298000	Users to try a specific new game
3298000	3300000	We should deliver it to their Nintendo 3DS
3300000	3302000	And possibly Wii U
3302000	3304000	With their prior consent, and recommend
3304000	3306000	That they just try it, and if they like it
3306000	3308000	They can pay for it. In this way, we need to
3308000	3310000	Introduce users to unknown products
3310000	3312000	Consumers are likely to be
3312000	3314000	Convinced to pay about 5,000 yen
3314000	3316000	For a well-established franchise product
3316000	3318000	But not all the people are willing to pay a certain
3318000	3320000	Amount of money for an innovative but unknown
3320000	3322000	Product. Now is the time to prepare for
3322000	3324000	These situations. So what's interesting about that
3324000	3326000	Is Nintendo is basically saying, we need to find
3326000	3328000	A way to just put demos on people's systems
3328000	3330000	Now, he does it, now
3330000	3332000	There is a very important quote before you run away
3332000	3334000	With this that says, you know, with their
3334000	3336000	Prior consent. They're already doing this, they're already
3336000	3338000	Doing this on the 3DS as far as like
3338000	3340000	Cause the stupid Pokemon thing downloaded
3340000	3342000	To mine, I'm like, I don't want this fucking shit
3342000	3344000	No, it didn't download automatically, did it? You had to get it through
3344000	3346000	The store. I had to get mine through the store
3346000	3348000	No, mine downloaded automatically. Really?
3348000	3350000	I know that OK Go video came in on one of the
3350000	3352000	Matches automatically, and then it was taken away
3352000	3354000	But that's not a big deal. I mean, they have the same type of thing
3354000	3356000	Right now. In fact, I think it's still around
3356000	3358000	On Xbox Live Arcade. Remember, you could
3358000	3360000	Sign up, basically, and have all the demos
3360000	3362000	For the games that come out, you know, download to your system
3362000	3364000	You can try them if you like them, then you buy them
3364000	3366000	Well now, this could be a big deal for people
3366000	3368000	That are, I mean, you know, OK, fair enough
3368000	3370000	Xbox does it too, but just, you know, throw it out there
3370000	3372000	People that have to watch their bandwidth
3372000	3374000	And, you know, with this whole 250
3374000	3376000	Gig bandwidth, some people get close
3376000	3378000	To that with all the HD movies they watch
3378000	3380000	Some people don't, maybe don't want all that data
3380000	3382000	Coming through. Well, then they don't have to
3382000	3384000	Sign up for it, but here's the thing that I think
3384000	3386000	Is more interesting is the fact that they're putting out demos
3388000	3390000	Say, I mean, Nintendo, a company that
3390000	3392000	They've said, hey, you know what?
3392000	3394000	Our games are so awesome
3394000	3396000	Remember, chart 10 times awesome as before
3396000	3398000	That we don't need demos
3398000	3400000	For them. We're just gonna, you know,
3400000	3402000	We're putting that stuff out there, and you're gonna see Nintendo
3402000	3404000	And you're like, oh, I gotta buy that
3404000	3406000	And so now, they realize
3406000	3408000	Hey, you know what? People like playing demos
3408000	3410000	To see if your game's crap
3410000	3412000	Or not
3412000	3414000	Alright, well
3414000	3416000	I like demos and hate crap
3416000	3418000	Do you like crappy demos?
3418000	3420000	No
3420000	3422000	Alright, let's move on with more news
3422000	3424000	Well, I like them because I don't have to pay for them
3424000	3426000	Dark Soccer, while you're at it, why don't you give us some more gaming news
3426000	3428000	Well, how about some Zoonie stuff?
3428000	3430000	There is a rumor that the
3430000	3432000	Zoon Marketplace is being revamped
3432000	3434000	On Xbox 360 as a streaming
3434000	3436000	Video service
3436000	3438000	And it already had the ability to
3438000	3440000	Stream, but this is specifically
3440000	3442000	For some sort of service they're gonna
3442000	3444000	Be offering, I believe something along the lines of
3444000	3446000	Like Netflix, but this of course
3446000	3448000	Is under the Zoon brand
3448000	3450000	Microsoft
3450000	3452000	Basically saying
3452000	3454000	No comment, blah blah blah
3454000	3456000	But, it could already be happening
3456000	3458000	I mean, this could
3458000	3460000	Be related to what they were announcing
3460000	3462000	At E3
3462000	3464000	At their press conference, or maybe related to
3464000	3466000	Xbox Live Diamond, who knows
3466000	3468000	Like
3468000	3470000	Okay, I already have Netflix
3470000	3472000	Well, you know
3472000	3474000	I already have Hulu
3474000	3476000	Xbox has been kind of centralizing a lot of their stuff lately
3476000	3478000	And kind of folding in dated brands
3478000	3480000	Like we had the story last week about Game for Windows
3480000	3482000	Kind of becoming Xbox.com
3482000	3484000	Didn't Xbox stop making the Zoon
3484000	3486000	Like about a year and a half ago
3486000	3488000	So, it's no surprise at all that
3488000	3490000	Something had to happen to the Zoon Marketplace
3490000	3492000	Well, and it makes sense to me because
3492000	3494000	I look at even like the Playstation Network
3494000	3496000	And stuff, they have
3496000	3498000	I don't even know how many streaming services on there
3498000	3500000	Sony has one, they have Vudu
3500000	3502000	And Netflix
3502000	3504000	And I'm sure Hulu Plus
3504000	3506000	Is on there
3506000	3508000	I think there's a few other ones on top of that
3508000	3510000	So it makes sense that they would have a few different offerings
3510000	3512000	On the Xbox Marketplace
3512000	3514000	As well
3514000	3516000	They gotta do something with that Zoon name
3516000	3518000	I would, yeah
3518000	3520000	But they're not gonna call it the Zoon
3520000	3522000	They're probably just gonna have some Microsoft streaming
3522000	3524000	Service or something like that
3524000	3526000	I don't know
3526000	3528000	This is kind of funny
3528000	3530000	Remember how we talked about Gears of War 3 leaking out last week
3530000	3532000	Well, who
3532000	3534000	Who possibly could have leaked this out
3534000	3536000	But actually
3536000	3538000	It was funny because it was
3538000	3540000	Linked out by a
3540000	3542000	Third party
3542000	3544000	I guess outsource
3544000	3546000	Company that was storing
3546000	3548000	The code on their website
3548000	3550000	Codify, they're a
3550000	3552000	Australian based hosting company
3552000	3554000	Which lists Microsoft as a client
3554000	3556000	And it
3556000	3558000	Literally was behind no protection whatsoever
3558000	3560000	All you had to do was go to
3560000	3562000	Xbox.codify.com
3562000	3564000	Which is now obviously locked up
3564000	3566000	And you can literally
3566000	3568000	Find the code right there
3568000	3570000	Just go and
3570000	3572000	Download the whole
3572000	3574000	Folders and everything
3574000	3576000	Right for the picking
3576000	3578000	That's just straight up embarrassing
3578000	3580000	That is pretty bad
3580000	3582000	Not even a login or password
3582000	3584000	The password wasn't password
3584000	3586000	There's just no password
3586000	3588000	No login, no password
3588000	3590000	There was confidential in the folder
3590000	3592000	Oh please
3592000	3594000	That was a dopey thing to do
3594000	3596000	Someone's head's rolling for that decision
3596000	3598000	That was just a lazy
3598000	3600000	Dumb thing to do
3600000	3602000	I don't care what game it was
3602000	3604000	It's an unfortunate result
3604000	3606000	And that doesn't make the result right
3606000	3608000	But come on
3608000	3610000	To take no security whatsoever
3610000	3612000	Was a horrible decision
3612000	3614000	It is pretty bad
3614000	3616000	And clearly this company
3616000	3618000	Has no security
3618000	3620000	Officer
3620000	3622000	Cyber security person
3622000	3624000	Specialist
3624000	3626000	Clearly this company has none of that
3626000	3628000	Or that person has been on vacation for six months
3628000	3630000	Dude, I mean, you could seriously
3630000	3632000	Go on
3632000	3634000	On any of these file sharing sites
3634000	3636000	Hell, they could have used
3636000	3638000	Like a site like mega upload
3638000	3640000	Or something like that
3640000	3642000	You know, some ridiculously stupid website
3642000	3644000	And at least that you can put a password on
3644000	3646000	This site, nothing
3646000	3648000	Randy in our chat room says
3648000	3650000	Somewhere an employee is being yelled at
3650000	3652000	I would say somewhere in a Microsoft meeting
3652000	3654000	An agreement is being terminated
3654000	3656000	With this company
3656000	3658000	I would say that
3658000	3660000	It's gonna be a lot more serious
3660000	3662000	And then people at that said company
3662000	3664000	Are gonna lose their jobs
3664000	3666000	And the sad thing is, it's not gonna be anybody
3666000	3668000	Involved with this
3668000	3670000	It'll be the fault of the executive
3670000	3672000	Who didn't hire a privacy person
3672000	3674000	You know what's funny too
3674000	3676000	Not only was the game leaked
3676000	3678000	But there was some of the tools that they used for the game as well
3678000	3680000	Leaked with it
3680000	3682000	It's awesome
3682000	3684000	It's sad
3684000	3686000	Alright
3686000	3688000	The gamers will never go away
3688000	3690000	But we've got to address them because it's making
3690000	3692000	The way around the game blogs
3692000	3694000	Let's see
3694000	3696000	Taiwan based component makers
3696000	3698000	According to Digitimes
3698000	3700000	Have said that
3700000	3702000	The Playstation 4 will feature
3702000	3704000	Body movement control
3704000	3706000	Similar to Kinect
3706000	3708000	And it's going to be released in 2012
3708000	3710000	This is coming from Foxcon
3710000	3712000	I'm sorry, it's not coming from
3712000	3714000	The report is further saying
3714000	3716000	That Foxcon and Pegatron technology
3716000	3718000	Who make the PS3
3718000	3720000	They will also be working on the Playstation 4
3720000	3722000	The shipment volume of the Playstation 4
3722000	3724000	In 2012 is supposed to be at least 20 million units
3724000	3726000	So there you go
3726000	3728000	Supposedly
3728000	3730000	The Playstation 4 is coming out as soon as next year
3730000	3732000	There's a few things
3732000	3734000	That seem a little weird about that
3734000	3736000	I mean, very well
3736000	3738000	Let's say if it was actually coming out next year
3738000	3740000	Then yes, it would probably have to be starting production right now
3740000	3742000	But a few things
3742000	3744000	That seem kind of off on that
3744000	3746000	Is the fact that they're looking to ship 20 million units
3746000	3748000	I mean, even if it was 20 million units worldwide
3748000	3750000	No console launch
3750000	3752000	Has been that big
3752000	3754000	Never that big
3754000	3756000	And that would be a lot of units just sitting there
3756000	3758000	A lot of wasted resources
3758000	3760000	They're going to want to have that launch
3760000	3762000	Basically the numbers
3762000	3764000	As on as possible
3764000	3766000	Because you don't want to just have all this
3766000	3768000	Hardware sitting there that's not being sold
3768000	3770000	Because that's money
3770000	3772000	That you're just pissing away
3772000	3774000	So my guess, I mean
3774000	3776000	The best console launch is I would imagine that you could
3776000	3778000	Probably push maybe
3778000	3780000	Maybe 5 million
3780000	3782000	You know, as a console launch
3782000	3784000	Or something like that
3784000	3786000	For something like this
3786000	3788000	I mean, that would be a lot
3788000	3790000	Just like right away
3790000	3792000	So 20 million, that seems wrong
3792000	3794000	The other thing that strikes me as odd
3794000	3796000	About this story is the whole
3796000	3798000	It will feature body movement control
3798000	3800000	To disconnect
3800000	3802000	I'm looking at that a little bit through side eye
3802000	3804000	Because that would show me that
3804000	3806000	Sony has already abandoned the Move
3806000	3808000	I wouldn't doubt that they would though
3808000	3810000	That makes sense
3810000	3812000	I'm a little yes and no on that
3812000	3814000	I mean, the Move definitely probably has not broken through
3814000	3816000	The way it should have
3816000	3818000	Or the way that Connect has
3818000	3820000	But at the same time
3820000	3822000	There's a part of me that wants to say
3822000	3824000	Connect hasn't really proven itself
3824000	3826000	But at the same time, yes it is the fastest selling
3826000	3828000	Like the Connect is in the rut that the Wii was in
3828000	3830000	At the same time, we all should have seen it coming
3830000	3832000	That, you know, after the initial wave of games
3832000	3834000	There's just kind of a bunch of finger tapping
3834000	3836000	On the desk, there's not a lot
3836000	3838000	And not a lot that we got excited about at E3 this year
3838000	3840000	There will be some stuff coming out
3840000	3842000	But yeah, it's not
3842000	3844000	It's not really a lot of stuff that's
3844000	3846000	Diverting from what's already out there
3846000	3848000	There's going to be dancing games
3848000	3850000	Because obviously those have done well
3850000	3852000	There's going to be sports games because those have done well
3852000	3854000	There's going to be kind of the same type of fairy
3854000	3856000	On like the Wii because that's
3856000	3858000	Just what's working
3858000	3860000	Yeah, and the other thing you also have to consider too
3860000	3862000	Is that
3862000	3864000	They're still making PS3s
3864000	3866000	And they're still, you know, the PS3 is
3866000	3868000	Going to be their push, especially with the fourth core
3868000	3870000	That they have right now
3870000	3872000	They're going to be wanting to have tons of PS3
3872000	3874000	And it's going to be hard to have
3874000	3876000	Two systems being
3876000	3878000	Manufactured at the same time
3878000	3880000	You know, I
3880000	3882000	I just don't see it happening this soon
3882000	3884000	I think they're just going to stick to their ten year plan
3884000	3886000	Because they kind of do that with the move
3886000	3888000	And I don't know if they've really tapped out yet
3888000	3890000	With what they can do on the PS3
3890000	3892000	I hope not, I mean it's not
3892000	3894000	I think that they can do a lot more
3894000	3896000	And at the end of the day it's still
3896000	3898000	A cheap Blu-ray player for a lot of people
3898000	3900000	That, you know, are as Blu-ray
3900000	3902000	Is getting into more and more homes as HDTVs
3902000	3904000	Get in more and more homes
3904000	3906000	I think, you know, Sony still has that advantage
3906000	3908000	That they're the only ones that's a Blu-ray player
3908000	3910000	Still at the end of the day
3910000	3912000	So, you know, and I think that's been helping
3912000	3914000	Move a lot more units than they might want to admit
3914000	3916000	That they would probably
3916000	3918000	Chalk up to the quality of the games
3918000	3920000	And so forth, but I think the fact that it's a Blu-ray player
3920000	3922000	Has been really moving it
3922000	3924000	So where the hell does the story come from?
3924000	3926000	Is it just a bunch of bullshit?
3926000	3928000	Or could it maybe be that there's some type of
3928000	3930000	New PlayStation 3 redesign in the works
3930000	3932000	I could see that before I would believe
3932000	3934000	That a PlayStation 4 is in the works
3934000	3936000	Like yet another PlayStation 3 slim
3936000	3938000	Maybe with
3938000	3940000	Move more integrated into it or something
3940000	3942000	I don't know if they would do that, but like
3942000	3944000	Um
3944000	3946000	I don't buy this yet
3946000	3948000	I mean, cause there's, other than someone saying
3948000	3950000	Oh, well this is what's gonna happen, we haven't seen any
3950000	3952000	You know, like with the FoxCon announcements
3952000	3954000	Usually a lot of that will see, you know
3954000	3956000	Pictures of the motherboards or something like that for these
3956000	3958000	And um
3958000	3960000	You know, some sort of physical evidence for it
3960000	3962000	Cause right now just one person's saying that that works
3962000	3964000	Because you work at a
3964000	3966000	I mean, you don't even know if you work there
3966000	3968000	You just say that you're a worker for one of these
3968000	3970000	Places, doesn't necessarily
3970000	3973000	I don't know, I don't know if I can trust that source
3973000	3976000	I would just be willing to bet right now that
3976000	3978000	It's probably
3978000	3980000	You know, I think it's gonna be
3980000	3983000	A while still before we see the new console
3983000	3986000	Unless, unless of course the Wii U really takes off
3986000	3988000	And I think that they're gonna have to kinda
3988000	3990000	Speed things along a bit, but I don't
3990000	3992000	Honestly, with the Wii U, I mean
3992000	3995000	I don't think it's gonna all of a sudden
3995000	3997000	Just take over, I mean
3997000	3999000	The Wii is still the number one
3999000	4001000	Selling console right now, but
4001000	4003000	I don't think it's
4003000	4005000	I don't think it is anymore, if you look at the monthly numbers
4005000	4007000	I haven't been able to look at
4007000	4009000	The NPD reports have changed, so I haven't gotten to see
4009000	4011000	A lot of stuff, but
4011000	4013000	You know
4013000	4015000	It's not like
4015000	4017000	I think it's still cumulatively the top overall
4017000	4019000	But it's not the month to month
4019000	4021000	Overall, it's the largest
4021000	4023000	Selling system, but
4023000	4025000	I just, I don't think
4025000	4027000	That this Wii U is gonna be
4027000	4029000	I don't think they're gonna be able to pull
4029000	4031000	Wii numbers again, because
4031000	4033000	It's kind of like, well, we've already seen
4033000	4035000	That, and yeah, the tablet thing is a little
4035000	4037000	Bit new, but
4037000	4039000	I don't know if it's gonna be enough to get people into
4039000	4041000	I mean, look at the 3DS, perfect example
4041000	4043000	The 3D's new
4043000	4045000	And I mean, granted, you know
4045000	4047000	If all things were correct
4047000	4049000	If they had a good launch lineup
4049000	4051000	I think that things should have done really well
4051000	4053000	But they just aren't utilizing
4053000	4055000	It enough, I mean
4055000	4057000	3D looks okay, but
4057000	4059000	It's just nothing, it's like
4059000	4061000	I've kind of seen the tilt controls
4061000	4063000	I've seen that before, you know
4063000	4065000	All the stuff I've seen this before, it's not new
4065000	4067000	Alright
4067000	4069000	One more story for you guys, then we're gonna
4069000	4071000	Travel around the world and look at release dates
4071000	4073000	And what's coming out in a country near you
4073000	4075000	But first, releases, I'm sorry, first
4075000	4077000	A story from Dark Sakura, then releases
4077000	4079000	I was about to say, what are you doing skipping my story
4079000	4081000	Well
4081000	4083000	The
4083000	4085000	PSP had a digital comic service
4085000	4087000	And Sony said, nope, not anymore
4087000	4089000	Cut
4089000	4091000	Yes, it is going away
4091000	4097000	It has over 4,000 different comic book issues on it
4097000	4099000	But the digital comics
4099000	4101000	Is going away
4101000	4103000	For the PSP at least
4103000	4105000	It may go to other Sony devices
4105000	4107000	But not to the PSP
4107000	4109000	I think they're getting ready to transition
4109000	4113000	To Vita Land, Vita Land
4115000	4117000	Well, what do you think about this, Dark Sakura
4117000	4119000	You're probably the biggest comic book fan here
4119000	4121000	Out of the bunch, and you know, I know you
4121000	4123000	Like the traditional comic books
4123000	4125000	How did you feel about comics on PSP?
4125000	4127000	I didn't care about them, really
4127000	4129000	I've got comics on my iPhone
4129000	4131000	I have Marvel, I use
4131000	4133000	Marvel's digital service
4133000	4135000	I have stacks of comic books
4135000	4137000	All over the house
4137000	4139000	I have a drawer in my bedroom that's nothing but comics
4139000	4141000	We have a bin at Dan's Mother's
4141000	4143000	That's nothing but comics
4143000	4145000	I have a drawer in my bedroom that's nothing but
4145000	4147000	PEZ dispensers
4147000	4149000	I almost got you a PEZ dispenser
4149000	4151000	I tried to find you a Cruella one, but they didn't have it
4151000	4153000	Anyway
4153000	4155000	But it's like
4155000	4159000	I really think that it's a transitional thing
4159000	4161000	I think that they're starting to phase out
4161000	4165000	The maybe lesser used items
4165000	4167000	That are directly related to PSP
4167000	4169000	And start getting things ready for the new system
4171000	4173000	That's how I see it
4173000	4175000	And honestly, I really don't care
4175000	4177000	Because you have to be really careful
4177000	4181000	When doing comics for a small screen format
4181000	4183000	And sometimes you lose something
4183000	4185000	Maybe at the end of the day
4185000	4187000	They just weren't selling
4187000	4189000	Did you ever buy a comic book on the PSP?
4189000	4191000	No
4191000	4193000	I'm just trying to see what else they had
4193000	4195000	They had Batman Beyond
4195000	4197000	And Ender's Game
4197000	4199000	And Suicide Girls
4199000	4201000	Maybe IOS was just doing it better
4201000	4203000	And so people that did want to do digital distribution
4203000	4205000	Went there
4205000	4207000	Who knows
4207000	4209000	It could be
4209000	4211000	And honestly, I had a few different comic book readers on my iPhone
4211000	4213000	But the ones that I always thought were the best well done
4213000	4215000	Were the ones that were
4215000	4217000	Standalone releases
4217000	4219000	Through
4219000	4221000	The app store
4221000	4223000	For example
4223000	4225000	I tried a service and downloaded a few free comics
4225000	4227000	To see what it was like
4227000	4229000	And you kind of have to
4229000	4231000	Scroll funny through the system
4231000	4235000	Whereas when I got the Star Trek movie prequel ones
4235000	4237000	Oh, Countdown
4237000	4239000	That's what it was called
4239000	4241000	Those were well done because they were actually
4241000	4243000	Resized for the screen by panel
4243000	4245000	And done where you could see the action clearly
4245000	4247000	I'm going to our chatroom
4247000	4249000	There's actually a little bit of love going on
4249000	4251000	For Marvel's digital service
4251000	4253000	DDR Dollar Bill says
4253000	4255000	I like Marvel's digital service
4255000	4257000	Game Guru says
4257000	4259000	I started using Marvel's digital service myself
4259000	4261000	Robert M. in our chatroom says
4261000	4263000	Will the PSP app still be available for back issues?
4263000	4265000	That's a good question
4265000	4267000	I don't see why they would close the app
4267000	4269000	And I would imagine their agreements with the publishers
4269000	4271000	Allow it so that if you have purchased a comic
4271000	4273000	You get to keep it
4273000	4275000	There's no reason for them to take it down
4275000	4277000	They said nothing about taking it down
4277000	4279000	They just are going to stop supporting it
4279000	4281000	Right, it'll be like Microsoft Game Room
4281000	4283000	If you really want to go into Game Room
4283000	4285000	And download a lot of the old games you can
4285000	4287000	But a new game hasn't come out in about a year now
4287000	4289000	Yeah, but they're not going to deny people
4289000	4291000	Who have already used the service
4291000	4293000	That would just be really crappy
4293000	4295000	Exactly, that's exactly it
4295000	4297000	And for the record, Marvel's digital comic service
4297000	4299000	Is really nice
4299000	4301000	Very easy to use
4301000	4303000	I'll go on Avengers West Coast
4303000	4305000	Very quickly with that
4305000	4307000	One of these days I'll get me an iPad
4307000	4309000	And I'll check that out
4309000	4311000	But we'll see
4311000	4313000	I'm a ways off from that
4313000	4315000	Alright, let's go travel the world and look at some release dates
4315000	4317000	What is coming to a gaming store near you
4317000	4319000	Logie, start us off with the US
4319000	4321000	Not a whole lot this week
4321000	4323000	Starting off with NCAA football
4323000	4325000	For Xbox 360 and Playstation 3
4325000	4327000	Gods and Heroes
4327000	4329000	Rome Rising collector's edition
4329000	4331000	Out this week on PC
4331000	4333000	Let's see
4333000	4335000	The Elder Scrolls Oblivion 5th anniversary edition
4335000	4337000	With a nice little map in there
4337000	4339000	And some DLC
4339000	4341000	Plus $10 towards Skyrim
4341000	4343000	And that's only 30 bucks
4343000	4345000	On Playstation 3, Xbox 360
4345000	4347000	And the Wii
4347000	4349000	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
4349000	4351000	Part 2 on Playstation 3
4351000	4353000	Xbox 360, Wii, DS
4353000	4355000	And PC
4355000	4357000	UFC Personal Trainer
4357000	4359000	On the Wii
4359000	4361000	And let's see here
4361000	4363000	And that's actually it
4363000	4365000	It's our week
4365000	4367000	Alright, let's look at Japan
4367000	4369000	And what's coming out over there
4369000	4371000	On the
4371000	4373000	I think it would be the 14th
4373000	4375000	It would be the release date
4375000	4377000	There is actually nothing on the Xbox 360
4377000	4379000	Of note
4379000	4381000	So turning around here to look at the Playstation 3
4381000	4383000	Releases
4383000	4385000	Playstation 3 has a couple releases
4385000	4387000	Japan Midnight gets a price reduction
4387000	4389000	On July 14th
4389000	4391000	It moves into the Playstation 3 best
4391000	4393000	As does White Knight Chronicles 2
4393000	4395000	Moves into the best series
4395000	4397000	And I believe the American
4397000	4399000	Or the Europe release of that is not too far away
4399000	4401000	I've been reading some early reviews on it
4401000	4403000	That have not been too kind
4403000	4405000	Also on the Playstation 3 this week in Japan
4405000	4407000	Brink and Tenchou no Igo
4407000	4409000	As well as Jikkyou
4409000	4411000	Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2011
4411000	4413000	Comes out this week
4413000	4415000	This is a baseball game
4415000	4417000	From Konami
4417000	4419000	With chibi little characters
4419000	4421000	Not a series I believe we have over here
4421000	4423000	Looking at some of the other systems
4423000	4425000	Trying to see if there's actually anything on the Wii at all
4425000	4427000	I don't think so
4427000	4429000	But we do have the PSP
4429000	4431000	We have
4431000	4433000	Taiko no Tatujin Portable DX
4433000	4435000	Comes out
4435000	4437000	Music game fans may recognize that as the
4437000	4439000	Taiko drumming game
4439000	4441000	Looks like there's a new version of that
4441000	4443000	This week in Japan
4443000	4445000	Unchained Blades Rex comes out this week
4445000	4447000	And Ys
4447000	4449000	Gets price reductions all over the place
4449000	4451000	As they move into the best series
4451000	4453000	Ys 1 and 2, Ys 7
4453000	4455000	And Ys vs. Sora no Kiseuke
4455000	4457000	Alternative Saga
4457000	4459000	All those are getting price reductions this week
4459000	4461000	So if you're an Ys fan that's late to the party
4461000	4463000	In Japan
4463000	4465000	Good news, you get to get in cheap now
4465000	4467000	Ys 3 is the best
4467000	4469000	One game of note on the Wii
4469000	4471000	16th from level 5
4471000	4473000	Inazuma Eleven Strikers
4473000	4475000	It's a sports game
4475000	4477000	Coming out from level 5
4477000	4479000	It's a soccer game
4479000	4481000	Looks like it incorporates characters from
4481000	4483000	Various other games and anime
4483000	4485000	So it looks like kind of like a
4485000	4487000	Fan wank soccer game
4487000	4489000	Good times
4489000	4491000	Alright, let's move on
4491000	4493000	With the UK dates
4493000	4495000	We have a few
4495000	4497000	Going ahead and pulling up that list
4497000	4499000	On the 11th we have
4499000	4501000	Air Conflict Secret Wars
4501000	4503000	And the 13th we have Boulder Dash XL
4503000	4505000	And Ms. Splosion Man
4505000	4507000	On the 15th we have
4507000	4509000	Captain America Super Soldier
4509000	4511000	Coming out on damn near everything
4511000	4513000	And also on just about everything
4513000	4515000	But maybe not as many things as Captain America
4515000	4517000	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2
4517000	4519000	Done
4519000	4521000	Nice
4521000	4523000	Told ya
4523000	4525000	Alright, let's do a couple more gaming news
4525000	4527000	Stories and then the classic game of the week
4527000	4529000	We will take a stroll down memory lane
4529000	4531000	And remember a classic game
4531000	4533000	In just a moment
4533000	4535000	People weren't really happy with the Resident Evil
4535000	4537000	Mercenaries 3D save controversy
4537000	4539000	The fact that, you know, Capcom was not allowing
4539000	4541000	People to erase their saves
4541000	4543000	Guess
4543000	4545000	Their particular save system
4545000	4547000	You know, they didn't allow people to reset
4547000	4549000	Because they're claiming it's more like an arcade game
4549000	4551000	You know, where you can't reset scores on an arcade machine
4551000	4553000	You know, this isn't the first time
4553000	4555000	Now that I think of it that Capcom has
4555000	4557000	Fucked up a save system
4557000	4559000	You may remember Dead Rising 1
4559000	4561000	They had real issues with that
4561000	4563000	It's like, do you guys not know how to program
4563000	4565000	You know, save games correctly
4565000	4567000	Is that really a problem for you?
4567000	4569000	But they're saying though
4569000	4571000	That their intent was
4571000	4573000	Never quite malicious
4573000	4575000	You know, despite the
4575000	4577000	Conspiracy theories out there
4577000	4579000	That would have you believe
4579000	4581000	And that they said that the
4581000	4583000	Reset saves was a conscious design decision
4583000	4585000	Aimed at maintaining the arcade fighter
4585000	4587000	Feeling of the title
4587000	4589000	That's so much bullshit
4589000	4591000	It's just ridiculous
4591000	4593000	You know, although they did release
4593000	4595000	This statement
4595000	4597000	And now I'm wondering, I don't know if it's bullshit
4597000	4599000	So much as it just was a dumb decision
4599000	4601000	Like, I
4601000	4603000	Wonder if somebody didn't really say
4603000	4605000	We don't need to program in the save
4605000	4607000	Delete thing, it's like an arcade
4607000	4609000	Skip that part, like just a dumb decision
4609000	4611000	There is a device out there though
4611000	4613000	That will actually erase those save games
4613000	4615000	That I saw out there
4615000	4617000	Cause there was an article I saw where you can
4617000	4619000	They're recommending, well one of the two ways
4619000	4621000	You can delete your save games, one through the game to a campfire
4621000	4623000	Two, use this device
4623000	4625000	And the device apparently allows you to back up
4625000	4627000	Game saves on 3DS and DS
4627000	4629000	And also allows you to erase them
4629000	4631000	So
4631000	4633000	They could easily just fix this with a patch
4633000	4635000	You know, 3DS games are
4635000	4637000	You can patch those
4637000	4639000	You can patch Capcom, you can patch them
4639000	4641000	You do this shit on consoles
4641000	4643000	I mean, why don't you just say
4643000	4645000	Hey, you know what, we fucked up
4645000	4647000	You guys want, you know, your save reset stuff
4647000	4649000	I'll tell you what, we're gonna go ahead and patch it in
4649000	4651000	So you can reset your saves
4651000	4653000	But no, they're being dicks, so
4653000	4655000	Fine, that's fine
4655000	4657000	I wasn't gonna buy this game anyways
4657000	4659000	And even less reason to do so now
4659000	4661000	Yeah, it's kinda one of those games that
4661000	4663000	I probably wouldn't have bought anyway
4663000	4665000	But I especially am not gonna buy it now
4665000	4667000	Let's move on to a story that's
4667000	4669000	Actually, I think this is kinda one of those
4669000	4671000	Pretty awesome stories I wanna talk about here
4671000	4673000	And this has to do with Dr. Stephen Hicks
4673000	4675000	Who is a clinical neurologist at the University of Oxford
4675000	4677000	He is working on
4677000	4679000	Some glasses
4679000	4681000	That has technology that's inspired
4681000	4683000	By Xbox 360 connect games
4683000	4685000	iPads
4685000	4687000	And what these glasses are, they're to help
4687000	4689000	Blind folks see shapes and people better
4689000	4691000	And it uses the technology
4691000	4693000	Of the Kinect and the iPads
4693000	4695000	It's mostly for folks that
4695000	4697000	Like, they can detect light
4697000	4699000	But they can't fully see
4699000	4701000	The glasses would use these cameras
4701000	4703000	That would be on corners of the lenses
4703000	4705000	To detect the information
4705000	4707000	And then it would send it to a little computer
4707000	4709000	You know, because everything's so tiny these days
4709000	4711000	I guess it's all in the glasses
4711000	4713000	The computer will then translate the information
4713000	4715000	And transmit it to LEDs
4715000	4717000	Inside the lenses of the glasses
4717000	4719000	And those LEDs would light up
4719000	4721000	In patterns that you would be trained
4721000	4723000	To understand
4723000	4725000	The visor
4725000	4727000	I know, right? And even some blogs
4727000	4729000	Around the internet put this picture of
4729000	4731000	LeVar Burton
4731000	4733000	From the next generation
4733000	4735000	With the freaking headband visor
4735000	4737000	But you know, I think that's
4737000	4739000	That's amazing that video game technology
4739000	4741000	That's one of those good stories
4741000	4743000	You'll never hear on
4743000	4745000	CNN and so forth
4745000	4747000	A doctor was inspired by what he saw with the Kinect
4747000	4749000	And what he saw with the iPads
4749000	4751000	He said, hey, if the Kinect sends out
4751000	4753000	These lasers all around the room
4753000	4755000	To detect what's in the room
4755000	4757000	Why couldn't you like
4757000	4759000	Scrunch the Kinect down into a pair of glasses
4759000	4761000	And have the glasses emit the lasers
4761000	4763000	Around the room and then kind of translate that
4763000	4765000	Into what, you know, somebody who
4765000	4767000	Maybe isn't like totally blind
4767000	4769000	But can see at least light
4769000	4771000	Maybe help kind of translate
4771000	4773000	That into something
4773000	4775000	Also, the story goes on saying
4775000	4777000	There could be an earpiece
4777000	4779000	That could possibly give detailed spoken information
4779000	4781000	Like what time a bus leaves
4781000	4783000	Could you imagine that?
4783000	4785000	Imagine this
4785000	4787000	On the front of the bus
4787000	4789000	And I'm totally making this up
4789000	4791000	It puts this image in my head
4791000	4793000	The front of the bus has one of those
4793000	4795000	QR type of codes
4795000	4797000	And so a person wearing these glasses
4797000	4799000	The laser could scan that QR code
4799000	4801000	From a distance and tell that person in their ear
4801000	4803000	This is the bus that goes to market
4803000	4805000	Or whatever
4805000	4807000	That's amazing
4807000	4809000	That's actually a really good idea
4809000	4811000	Copyright it real quick
4811000	4813000	Patent pending
4813000	4815000	But you know what I mean
4815000	4817000	I gotta hand it to this guy
4817000	4819000	I mean, thinking to put the Kinect in glasses
4819000	4821000	Is a pretty good idea
4821000	4823000	I'm just saying, you know, we have this very
4823000	4825000	Scan society where we scan codes
4825000	4827000	And now it's in the iPhone application
4827000	4829000	Why can't the visor scan those codes?
4829000	4831000	That'd be amazing
4831000	4833000	Kaijuto says
4833000	4835000	Name them Kinect specs
4835000	4837000	I know we have some blind gamers
4837000	4839000	That listen to this show
4839000	4841000	So I would really love to hear like what you think
4841000	4843000	About this
4843000	4845000	Like if this is
4845000	4847000	If you think this is gonna be amazing
4847000	4849000	Or if maybe you have
4849000	4851000	Trouble conceptualizing this
4851000	4853000	Cause you know, I read this
4853000	4855000	And I go, it's gonna help the blind see
4855000	4857000	And I go, oh that's a great thing
4857000	4859000	But you know, I'm not actually blind
4859000	4861000	So I would like to hear from somebody
4861000	4863000	To let me know if like this is actually gonna be a great
4863000	4865000	Thing
4865000	4867000	You know they're actually also working on
4867000	4869000	Retinal patches
4869000	4871000	That are supposed to rework
4871000	4873000	The way the optic nerve
4873000	4875000	Takes in the information
4875000	4877000	For cases of people with nerve damage
4877000	4879000	And it's actually very similar in theory
4879000	4881000	Because these are actually
4881000	4883000	Relaying
4883000	4885000	It's like they've got these implants that relay information
4885000	4887000	Directly into the optic nerve
4887000	4889000	So that people can quote see
4889000	4891000	But it's a lot of the same theory too
4891000	4893000	Instead it's just a matter of
4893000	4895000	Instead of directing
4895000	4897000	Going directly into the nerve, it's a matter of
4897000	4899000	Providing a projection
4899000	4901000	A display that can be
4901000	4903000	Recognizable to people
4903000	4905000	With that level of vision
4905000	4907000	So yeah, that makes sense
4907000	4909000	Kaijuto in the chat room says 800 Microsoft points
4909000	4911000	If you want to keep seeing past three months
4911000	4913000	That's wrong, that's just wrong
4915000	4917000	They do say that the goal is to bring
4917000	4919000	In the glasses at under a thousand
4919000	4921000	Pounds each, because remember this is being
4921000	4923000	Researched at Oxford University
4923000	4925000	But still, I mean, you know
4925000	4927000	That sounds really expensive, but
4927000	4929000	For a piece of technology
4929000	4931000	That you would use
4931000	4933000	Everywhere every day
4933000	4935000	That actually does not seem so bad at all
4935000	4937000	And pretty affordable
4937000	4939000	That's pretty awesome
4939000	4941000	Misty in our chat room at chat.onorsonshadeo.com says
4941000	4943000	Hey, pew pewing QR codes is fun
4943000	4945000	You know, there is
4945000	4947000	Something about those QR codes
4947000	4949000	Like, they're all ads for something
4949000	4951000	But yet, she's right
4951000	4953000	There's something about scanning those codes
4953000	4955000	It's kind of fun
4955000	4957000	But I'm just saying, why not
4957000	4959000	Really give those codes a real practical
4959000	4961000	Purpose that could actually better society
4961000	4963000	Rather than just giving URLs to websites
4963000	4965000	And things like that
4965000	4967000	Actually, put them up for events
4967000	4969000	Yeah
4969000	4971000	With a lot of the stuff that we do now
4971000	4973000	On school for advertising
4973000	4975000	We actually include the QR codes for the charity events
4975000	4977000	For, like, student council
4977000	4979000	Stuff
4979000	4981000	So they use them a lot in terms of
4981000	4983000	Passing along event information
4983000	4985000	And I actually find them a lot of times
4985000	4987000	Oddly enough, on Japanese blogs
4987000	4989000	Interesting
4989000	4991000	They've been having to scan the code
4991000	4993000	Things for forever
4993000	4995000	Mobile phones have always been more advanced
4995000	4997000	Over there. It isn't until we got the iPhone
4997000	4999000	When finally
4999000	5001000	They started looking at our phones
5001000	5003000	Going, hmm, we like that
5003000	5005000	But for the longest time, they were far more fast
5005000	5007000	Remember the after years? Final Fantasy 4, the after years
5007000	5009000	And the Wii? That was originally a mobile phone game in Japan
5009000	5011000	Well, and keep in mind too
5011000	5013000	Is that cellular networks are cheaper
5013000	5015000	Than landlines
5015000	5017000	Overseas
5017000	5019000	So it ended up becoming a much
5019000	5021000	Better market to develop
5021000	5023000	As opposed to people here
5023000	5025000	I still like my rotary phone!
5025000	5027000	I like the noises
5027000	5029000	I do like my rotary phone
5029000	5031000	But it's not as good
5031000	5033000	As having to actually call the operator
5033000	5035000	And ask to be put through
5035000	5037000	To, you know, Mrs. Cleaver
5037000	5039000	Although, you know, if people go to Geek Life
5039000	5041000	And click the link
5041000	5043000	For ThinkGeek
5043000	5045000	You can buy
5045000	5047000	A handset for your iPhone
5047000	5049000	A rotary phone style
5049000	5051000	Handset for your iPhone
5051000	5053000	You can also buy bacon mince on ThinkGeek
5053000	5055000	Yes you can
5055000	5057000	Anyhow
5057000	5059000	But follow the link
5059000	5061000	Anyway, but back to
5061000	5063000	Are we gonna get a kick back
5063000	5065000	For that little plug you just sent?
5065000	5067000	Maybe
5067000	5069000	But back to the point
5069000	5071000	I mean
5071000	5073000	It really has to do also with how far
5073000	5075000	Society itself is willing to advance
5075000	5077000	Keep in mind
5077000	5079000	I'm gonna use an old comparison here
5079000	5081000	Betamax and VHS
5081000	5083000	If you look at the two side by side
5083000	5085000	Betamax was the better format
5085000	5087000	You had a better picture quality
5087000	5089000	But it went
5089000	5091000	To VHS because of funding
5091000	5093000	Because that's what got the push
5093000	5095000	You know, it's that way with any
5095000	5097000	Technology, it depends on what's
5097000	5099000	Got the backing behind it
5099000	5101000	Where you're, say that you live in Japan
5101000	5103000	And it's better to have a cell phone service
5103000	5105000	You know
5105000	5107000	Then, obviously
5107000	5109000	That's where the money is, that's where people are gonna push the technology
5109000	5111000	But here, for the longest time
5111000	5113000	It was all landlines
5113000	5115000	Cell phones were novel, you had that big brick
5115000	5117000	In your car, you know
5117000	5119000	But now it's kind of turning around
5119000	5121000	Like, you know, Dan and I don't have a landline
5121000	5123000	God, I remember my parents' first cell phone
5123000	5125000	Like that fucker mounted in the
5125000	5127000	Middle of the car
5127000	5129000	And it was this giant handset
5129000	5131000	It looked like it was connected to a car battery
5131000	5133000	It looked like it caused cancer
5133000	5135000	No, we went to a trip
5135000	5137000	Coming back from
5137000	5139000	Washington one time when Dan's dad
5139000	5141000	Had his wedding
5141000	5143000	Soon after I moved out here
5143000	5145000	So we're talking about, you know
5145000	5147000	Late 90s
5147000	5149000	And it looked like a phone attached to a car battery
5149000	5151000	You know what I mean?
5151000	5153000	Yeah, it really did
5153000	5155000	Okay, who's seen Kill Bill?
5155000	5157000	And the phone that Sophie pops out
5157000	5159000	In the flashback scene
5159000	5161000	You know, that's what cell phones look like
5161000	5163000	Yeah, yeah
5163000	5165000	So
5165000	5167000	But my point is that it
5167000	5169000	Really depends on
5169000	5171000	The market the money is gonna be in
5171000	5173000	So
5173000	5175000	God, I met a kid the other day
5175000	5177000	Didn't know what a VHS tape was
5179000	5181000	I'm gonna smack him upside the head
5181000	5183000	I don't know what a VHS tape is
5183000	5185000	Well, because by the time
5185000	5187000	This guy would have been 5 or 6
5187000	5189000	DVDs were out
5189000	5191000	So what? I didn't, you know
5191000	5193000	I know what a fucking 8-track tape is
5193000	5195000	And I didn't fucking see those forever
5195000	5197000	I think part of it was just trolling
5197000	5199000	It made me think like
5199000	5201000	Oh god, you are old enough
5201000	5203000	Or maybe you only ever know what it is
5203000	5205000	I don't know what paper is
5205000	5207000	Paper and pen, I've got a Kindle
5207000	5209000	Actually, you know, it's funny
5209000	5211000	Going back to Japan
5211000	5213000	They had a phenomenon going on for a while
5213000	5215000	Where people were actually forgetting how to hand write
5215000	5217000	Certain kanji
5217000	5219000	Because they were so used to
5219000	5221000	Well basically, on my iPhone
5221000	5223000	Whenever I put in anything
5223000	5225000	Using the Japanese typewriter
5225000	5227000	I get a lot of words
5227000	5229000	That are spelled the same way
5229000	5231000	Actually, I could totally see that happening here
5231000	5233000	Like, I don't think that's just limited
5233000	5235000	To the complex written language
5235000	5237000	Of some of the Asian languages
5237000	5239000	Like, I
5239000	5241000	I would think even I am challenged
5241000	5243000	To sit down, like imagine if I had to sit down
5243000	5245000	And write a letter in cursive
5245000	5247000	Like, that would actually take a minute to kind of like
5247000	5249000	Like, some of the capital letters
5249000	5251000	You don't write every day
5251000	5253000	Actually? I take a lot of written notes
5253000	5255000	But I print, you know
5255000	5257000	But like, if I had to write cursive
5257000	5259000	Like, I don't really practice that
5259000	5261000	I actually do practice my cursive
5261000	5263000	Do you? You're a nerd
5263000	5265000	My mother used to
5265000	5267000	My mother used to sit me down
5267000	5269000	My mom has gorgeous
5269000	5271000	Handwriting
5271000	5273000	I always got F's in handwriting
5273000	5275000	Your son has Parkinson's
5275000	5277000	She would make me sit down and practice my handwriting
5277000	5279000	So to this day
5279000	5281000	And then when I went and took typography
5281000	5283000	I had to
5283000	5285000	Basically what he had us do is start off with glyphs
5285000	5287000	And then find out once our glyphs got to be a little bit more
5287000	5289000	You know, just free
5289000	5291000	Free drawing little glyphs
5291000	5293000	And once they got to be more complex
5293000	5295000	Then we said, okay, what letter does that look like
5295000	5297000	And we'd practice full letter forms
5297000	5299000	And then pick that and go from there
5299000	5301000	So it was, it was talking about, you know
5301000	5303000	How written language evolved
5303000	5305000	Just, you know, from
5305000	5307000	Reflex in your hands
5307000	5309000	My printed handwriting
5309000	5311000	Got better when I started my job as a corporate trainer
5311000	5313000	Because I have to write on the whiteboard
5313000	5315000	All the time
5315000	5317000	And it's actually kind of embarrassing that my handwriting sucks
5317000	5319000	Like, and I know, like, I'll be writing stuff on the board
5319000	5321000	And I'm like, oh god, it looks like a seven year old
5321000	5323000	Is teaching this class. Practice
5323000	5325000	But, yeah, well, you know
5325000	5327000	Well, and I've been doing my job long enough now where it's gotten a lot better
5327000	5329000	But, I mean, that's the whole point
5329000	5331000	Is that those handwriting
5331000	5333000	Skills aren't being focused on that much anymore
5333000	5335000	So people are forgetting
5335000	5337000	What should be a basic skill
5337000	5339000	I mean, a lot of people are actually even forgetting
5339000	5341000	The origins of their language
5341000	5343000	Like, I posted something from Crag today about
5343000	5345000	Words showing up in the dictionary, like, girl
5345000	5347000	Like, the G-R-R-R-L
5347000	5349000	And stuff, and
5349000	5351000	I'm like, those aren't real words
5351000	5353000	Those don't need to be there. That's slang
5353000	5355000	The one reason I would want to be an English teacher
5355000	5357000	Is to say, if you use any text speak in a written paper
5357000	5359000	You automatically fail this entire class
5359000	5361000	Well, and
5361000	5363000	My teacher, my second grade teacher
5363000	5365000	Was mean
5365000	5367000	Okay, she was pregnant
5367000	5369000	And then had her baby, so I think part of it might have been
5369000	5371000	Now that I'm an adult, it might have been postpartum
5371000	5373000	Right
5373000	5375000	But the first half of the semester we had the sweetest lady as the substitute
5375000	5377000	And then the rest of the year
5377000	5379000	Ms. Bitch came
5379000	5381000	Her name was Ms. Bitch
5381000	5383000	I'm not gonna say it, I still remember her name
5383000	5385000	But anyway, she used to just walk by
5385000	5387000	And smack our hands every time we started
5387000	5389000	Doing a letter form wrong
5389000	5391000	It's like, no, you're gonna sit and you're gonna start from the beginning
5391000	5393000	And rewrite the whole thing
5393000	5395000	But I think people
5395000	5397000	Are relying too much on their cell phones also
5397000	5399000	To correct their spelling
5399000	5401000	How many more
5401000	5403000	How much more often do you see people doing
5403000	5405000	T-H-E-R-E
5405000	5407000	When they mean a possessive there
5407000	5409000	Oh, right
5409000	5411000	I think people are relying too much on
5411000	5413000	Their autocorrect
5413000	5415000	It goes back to that same thing when I brought up Japan
5415000	5417000	With people forgetting how to write
5417000	5419000	You know, even
5419000	5421000	I was even reading an article the other day about how
5421000	5423000	A lot of the original
5423000	5425000	Kanji is actually now brought out in more simplified forms
5425000	5427000	And people are forgetting how to write the old way
5427000	5429000	But it's
5429000	5431000	I think that
5431000	5433000	Having our computers
5433000	5435000	And everything do this for us
5435000	5437000	Is making us all lazier as people
5437000	5439000	And
5439000	5441000	People are forgetting something that should just be
5441000	5443000	Something that you learn in first grade
5443000	5445000	Alright, OLR listeners
5445000	5447000	Now if you think maybe your handwriting could use some improvement
5447000	5449000	Here's a chance
5449000	5451000	To find a pen and paper
5451000	5453000	Which might be a chore all in itself
5453000	5455000	But find a pen and paper
5455000	5457000	And write down
5457000	5459000	The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
5459000	5461000	Five times every day
5461000	5463000	The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
5463000	5465000	Dark Soccer, you're a design person
5465000	5467000	Why is that sentence important?
5467000	5469000	Because it has every letter in the alphabet
5469000	5471000	Good job
5471000	5473000	That's also why it's used for typeface samples
5473000	5475000	But there's a few other sentences
5475000	5477000	That have everyone
5477000	5479000	Emma Gray
5479000	5481000	Which is one of the type foundries that I follow
5481000	5483000	Has different sample sheets out
5483000	5485000	That whole like lorem ipsum
5485000	5487000	No, not the lorem ipsum, different sentences
5487000	5489000	That have the same letters in them
5489000	5491000	See, I'm trying to
5491000	5493000	Integrate the geeky design stuff into the show for you
5493000	5495000	Thank you, it makes me happy
5495000	5497000	Throwing you a bone
5497000	5499000	I had a squee, which is why I was showing you someone
5499000	5501000	Throwing up rainbows on somebody else
5501000	5503000	I'll find the picture for the chatroom
5503000	5505000	Alright, well speaking of throwing up rainbows
5505000	5507000	Here's some happy music for you
5507000	5511000	They can always tell you that the classic game of the week is on its way
5511000	5513000	Every week Dark Soccer goes to the gaming vault
5513000	5517000	And finds a game that she thinks you ungrateful children should be checking out
5517000	5521000	Especially if you've never had VHS in your life
5521000	5523000	Then you probably have missed a lot of these games
5523000	5525000	I had a Betamax player
5525000	5527000	I had a Betamax player too, sit down
5527000	5529000	I had Clue on Betamax, sit down
5529000	5531000	I had an 8-track player
5531000	5533000	With a record player attached to it
5533000	5535000	And transistor tubes
5535000	5537000	Hold up to the classic game of the week
5537000	5539000	I had the record player
5539000	5541000	That was built into the, well my family had the record player
5541000	5543000	That was built into the shelf
5543000	5545000	Because the shelf was the speaker, it was so big
5545000	5547000	And we had Star Wars soundtrack on vinyl
5547000	5549000	And I wish I still had that today
5549000	5551000	Because that thing's probably worth a shit ton of money
5551000	5553000	You know what else I had on vinyl?
5553000	5555000	Close Encounters of the Third Kind
5555000	5557000	So I could listen to the, the track was called The Conversation
5557000	5559000	And I always knew which one it was
5559000	5561000	Based on how far apart the grooves were
5561000	5563000	But not only that, I had a record player
5563000	5565000	That lit up in different colors
5565000	5567000	When it was turned on
5567000	5569000	And you would play the Sesame Street records on them
5569000	5571000	That would read the book to you
5571000	5573000	And then when you hear the noise
5573000	5575000	Turn the page, bing!
5575000	5577000	Oh yeah?
5577000	5579000	I had a grandma phone, I had to fucking crank that shit
5579000	5581000	If I wanted something to play
5581000	5583000	My husband's laughing in the other room
5583000	5585000	But actually I'll tell you one thing
5585000	5587000	That I did have
5587000	5589000	I had an entire set of Voltron
5589000	5591000	Books on cassette
5591000	5593000	Black Wolf in Chat says I had reel to reel
5593000	5595000	Beotches. Dude, when I studied
5595000	5597000	Communication Design in college, we had to
5597000	5599000	Learn, like this is just
5599000	5601000	This is honestly
5601000	5603000	Should I say this on the radio?
5603000	5605000	Say it!
5605000	5607000	I have learned more from doing Orange Lounge Radio in the past
5607000	5609000	Nine years than I learned in college
5609000	5611000	Paying thousands of dollars
5611000	5613000	To attend this communication design program
5613000	5615000	And that's one of the reasons why I don't think
5615000	5617000	Me dropping out of college was such a bad idea
5617000	5619000	And why I think it's bullshit
5619000	5621000	And employers require BA degrees
5621000	5623000	And all this stuff
5623000	5625000	I know it's a controversial opinion to have
5625000	5627000	But I don't think school's for everyone
5627000	5629000	It's honestly true because I've seen more people
5629000	5631000	I've seen people with more talent in their little finger
5631000	5633000	Than people who've
5633000	5635000	Got masters in design
5635000	5637000	Yet they
5637000	5639000	Because in college
5639000	5641000	In college we had to learn
5641000	5643000	How to record to the reel to reel
5643000	5645000	And we had to learn how to edit
5645000	5647000	The reel to reel
5647000	5649000	With fucking tape and a wax pen
5649000	5651000	Where you listen to the thing and then you have to do
5651000	5653000	The wax pen to cut out the words
5653000	5655000	And all this stuff and guess how much
5655000	5657000	I've used a wax tape
5657000	5659000	In producing nine years
5659000	5661000	That last longer than most radio shows
5661000	5663000	Do on commercial radio
5663000	5665000	Guess how many times I've used a wax pen
5665000	5667000	In the nine years of doing this show
5667000	5669000	Zero
5669000	5671000	Because the state school
5671000	5673000	Is not on the cutting edge of technology
5673000	5677000	But you could get drinks really cheap
5677000	5679000	I can say this though
5679000	5681000	The design program at Sac State
5681000	5683000	Is actually really top notch and some of the people are hiring
5683000	5685000	Directly from Sac State now
5685000	5687000	Well I'm sure things have changed and so forth
5687000	5689000	But I'm just saying
5689000	5691000	Some people learn best from just being thrown in the pool
5691000	5693000	And told you better fucking swim to me
5693000	5695000	Well there's a book I'm reading right now
5695000	5697000	Which by the way the review should be on Geek Life
5697000	5699000	In a few days
5699000	5701000	And I know it's ironic that I'm a teacher now
5701000	5703000	But there's a big difference
5703000	5705000	Well but the book I'm reading
5705000	5707000	Is an autobiography
5707000	5709000	Of a big name in comics
5709000	5711000	And again everyone will find out who it is
5711000	5713000	But it's talking about how he broke into illustration
5713000	5715000	And comics just by
5715000	5717000	Drawing all the time and then being hired
5717000	5719000	Because of his talent because of his skill
5719000	5721000	And learning how to do
5721000	5723000	Newspaper editing
5723000	5725000	And you know
5725000	5727000	Airbrushing you know in the 30's
5727000	5729000	By being said
5729000	5731000	Coach these are your inks
5731000	5733000	So anyway
5733000	5735000	I realize my opinion is a little bit controversial
5735000	5737000	But I just speak from real life experience
5737000	5739000	I agree with you
5739000	5741000	I realize some of the people out there may not
5741000	5743000	And may even possibly be offended but I'm just saying
5743000	5745000	From my experience in my world
5745000	5747000	College did nothing for me
5747000	5749000	But fucked me up emotionally
5749000	5751000	Well like with the classes I've gone to
5751000	5753000	I know how to use the programs already
5753000	5755000	But I listen to my teachers
5755000	5757000	Who have been working in the field
5757000	5759000	I want their experience
5759000	5761000	It's a better thing when you have a teacher that gives you real life experience
5761000	5763000	Because they're in it
5763000	5765000	They're doing it
5765000	5767000	As opposed to oh I got my masters and now I'm gonna teach
5767000	5769000	You know what I mean
5769000	5771000	You can tell the difference
5771000	5773000	But yeah I'm sorry
5773000	5775000	Anyhow
5775000	5777000	Oh you know what else I had?
5777000	5779000	I had all of the Gremlins records that they gave out at McDonald's
5779000	5781000	With the Happy Meal
5781000	5783000	I had the record that came free in the newspaper
5783000	5785000	That sang the song about the
5785000	5787000	Mac McDLT a quarter pounder with some cheese
5787000	5789000	Layover hamburger and cheese
5789000	5791000	How do I remember that song? I remember that fucking song
5791000	5793000	I had the Fruit Loops one
5793000	5795000	Rob I had the Fruit Loops one
5795000	5797000	The one that came in on a square album
5797000	5799000	In a box of Fruit Loops
5799000	5801000	It's like a fucking plastic record
5801000	5803000	I know
5803000	5805000	I love how we went from throwing up rainbows
5805000	5807000	You know
5807000	5809000	You know you're old school when you've had
5809000	5811000	A warped record and you fixed it yourself
5811000	5813000	You know you're old school when you know
5813000	5815000	That the best version of Alice in Wonderland
5815000	5817000	They ever made was that TV movie in the 80's
5817000	5819000	With Carol Channing
5819000	5821000	I know
5821000	5823000	Back to rainbows
5825000	5827000	How about some classic games
5827000	5829000	Well this
5829000	5831000	I'm taking us all the way back
5831000	5833000	To 1996
5833000	5835000	That was before I moved out here
5835000	5837000	And I must thank my husband
5837000	5839000	For turning me on to this series even though
5839000	5841000	I did work for Namco for a little while
5841000	5843000	But I didn't really give it much thought until
5843000	5845000	My husband said
5845000	5847000	This game's awesome we're gonna play it
5847000	5849000	And it is Soul Edge
5849000	5851000	Woo
5851000	5853000	Soul Edge
5853000	5855000	You got soul
5855000	5857000	So
5857000	5859000	This is the intro so we have to play a little bit of the intro
5863000	5865000	Transcending history and the world
5865000	5867000	A tale of soul
5867000	5869000	And swords
5869000	5871000	Eternally told
5883000	5885000	Anyway
5885000	5887000	This game had
5887000	5889000	We've actually got this soundtrack
5889000	5891000	It's really cool but anyway
5891000	5893000	This is from the Playstation version
5893000	5895000	Soul Blade
5895000	5897000	Soul Edge is
5897000	5899000	A 3D fighting game
5899000	5901000	It was the second one that had characters with weapons
5901000	5903000	The first being Toushinden
5903000	5905000	And this
5905000	5907000	Actually had
5907000	5909000	Everyone had their different style
5909000	5911000	Depending on their actual weapon
5911000	5915000	This came out in arcades in 1996
5915000	5917000	And then there was
5917000	5919000	A different version that's called
5919000	5921000	Soul Edge version 2
5921000	5923000	That
5923000	5925000	Was basically a little bit easier because people found
5925000	5927000	The original to be
5927000	5929000	Really hard and that you couldn't beat the last boss
5929000	5931000	Hwang
5931000	5933000	Was put into
5933000	5935000	That version as well
5935000	5937000	He was actually originally a palette swap
5937000	5939000	Of Mitsurugi in the Korean version
5939000	5941000	And you could play as Cervantes
5941000	5943000	Who was the pirate
5943000	5945000	Who had the Soul Edge
5945000	5947000	The sword
5947000	5949000	They also put in air combos
5949000	5951000	And guard impacts
5951000	5953000	And everyone had upgraded moves
5953000	5955000	It came out like I said on the Playstation
5955000	5957000	As Soul Blade
5957000	5959000	And uh
5959000	5961000	It was
5961000	5963000	That's Cervantes music
5963000	5965000	I love that song it's so cool
5965000	5967000	But anyway everyone had their own little
5967000	5969000	Hold on let me let the listeners have a
5969000	5971000	Peek at this music real quick cause
5971000	5973000	I will say one thing I love
5973000	5975000	One thing I love about these games is the
5975000	5977000	Soundtracks I mean they're just
5977000	5981000	Amazing here we go little clip
5997000	5999000	But yes oh that's actually
5999000	6001000	I think my favorite piece in that game
6001000	6003000	That's the arranged version by the way from the
6003000	6005000	Playstation version
6005000	6007000	Cause the Playstation versions had arranged
6007000	6009000	Soundtracks as well as the original
6009000	6011000	Soundtracks so it was really cool
6011000	6013000	Nice
6013000	6015000	At any rate
6015000	6017000	It basically you could move
6017000	6019000	Your character all along
6019000	6021000	Their little
6021000	6023000	Stage area
6023000	6025000	And you had borders around the stage
6025000	6027000	If you fell off of your little stage
6027000	6029000	Then that was you know you'd die
6029000	6031000	It's kind of hard though to jump off the stage
6031000	6033000	Your jump was
6033000	6035000	Actually kind of
6035000	6037000	Not really so much of a jump
6037000	6039000	But some characters had better jumps
6039000	6041000	There was also
6041000	6043000	A weapon gauge
6043000	6045000	And it had your weapons resistance on it
6045000	6047000	And
6047000	6049000	When you would block an attack your bar would
6049000	6051000	Deplete and if it emptied you would lose
6051000	6053000	Your weapon
6053000	6055000	And then you'd have to finish the match unarmed
6055000	6057000	So basically like
6057000	6059000	Oops my sword broke oh crap
6059000	6061000	And
6061000	6063000	There were also
6063000	6065000	Locking moves too so you'd have to
6065000	6067000	Press the button you know at the right time
6067000	6069000	And see who could get out of it
6069000	6071000	Everyone had
6071000	6073000	One or two unblockable attacks
6073000	6075000	Which actually came from the Tekken series
6075000	6077000	And
6077000	6079000	It was really hard to pull them off
6079000	6081000	So that kept it pretty balanced and then
6081000	6083000	You had critical edge attacks
6083000	6085000	That were long
6085000	6087000	Like a long series of different links
6087000	6089000	Kind of like have you ever played in Tekken
6089000	6091000	When you used King's throws it was kind of the same deal
6091000	6093000	But then
6093000	6095000	There were
6095000	6097000	Different combinations of
6097000	6099000	Different attacks that would you know have
6099000	6101000	A special sequence
6101000	6103000	So on top of that it would also
6103000	6105000	Deplete a third of the weapons gauge
6105000	6107000	When you used it it was the ABK attacks
6107000	6109000	It had
6109000	6111000	Aggressive block which was called guard impact
6111000	6113000	That would
6113000	6115000	Give you a free counter attack
6115000	6117000	And then you also had like I said earlier
6117000	6119000	A ring out
6119000	6121000	You can't just jump out of the ring you have to be thrown out of the ring
6121000	6123000	The game
6123000	6125000	Itself according to
6125000	6127000	Namco
6127000	6129000	Took place in 1584
6129000	6131000	And it's warriors searching
6131000	6133000	For the soul edge
6133000	6135000	It had different names but it was pretty
6135000	6137000	Nasty
6137000	6139000	Anytime someone had it bad crap happened
6139000	6141000	So it had all kinds of
6141000	6143000	Different characters you had Siegfried
6143000	6145000	You have Mizurugi
6145000	6147000	You had Tamara
6147000	6149000	You had Taki who was your ninja girl
6149000	6151000	Voldo oh Voldo
6151000	6153000	He was Mr. Bondage boy
6153000	6155000	His weapon was a
6155000	6157000	K-tar
6157000	6159000	The hand mounted blade
6159000	6161000	And he wore lots of
6161000	6163000	Strappy leather
6163000	6165000	I'm sure some of us recall
6165000	6167000	And then there was
6167000	6169000	Like
6169000	6171000	Sungmina
6171000	6173000	And then there was a character added
6173000	6175000	Who was in Soul Blade
6175000	6177000	As a secret character
6177000	6179000	It came out on
6179000	6181000	Playstation on December 20th
6181000	6183000	1996 in Japan and it came out
6183000	6185000	In 97 in the USA and Europe
6185000	6187000	And it kept all
6187000	6189000	The soul edge version 2
6189000	6191000	And 5 unlockable characters
6191000	6193000	Including the soul edge
6193000	6195000	The boss of the game
6195000	6197000	Had arcade mode versus mode, survival, team battle
6197000	6199000	Time attack and training
6199000	6201000	Had an RPG mode called
6201000	6203000	Edge master mode
6203000	6205000	So you could basically
6205000	6207000	Go through a story had it like they were
6207000	6209000	A character in a book so it was kind of neat
6209000	6211000	And you had
6211000	6213000	Extra versions of different weapons
6213000	6215000	That had more power, more strength
6215000	6217000	More durability and like I said
6217000	6219000	Also you had an arranged soundtrack
6219000	6221000	And the arcade soundtrack
6221000	6223000	And then you had the
6223000	6225000	Khan super session
6225000	6227000	Which that's the album that we have
6227000	6229000	Is the Khan super session that
6229000	6231000	This band, their stuff
6231000	6233000	Is really really good stuff
6235000	6237000	So it is
6237000	6239000	Probably one of the best
6239000	6241000	Fighting games ever
6241000	6242000	I think
6242000	6244000	I think a lot of people have a lot of love for this game
6244000	6246000	I gotta admittedly I didn't get into this series
6246000	6248000	Until Soul Calibur 2
6248000	6250000	The arcade version
6250000	6252000	Which still is like one of my favorite
6252000	6254000	Gamecube games they ever made
6254000	6256000	That's actually from I just noticed this intro
6256000	6258000	That we're listening to the music off of
6258000	6260000	The Japanese intro
6260000	6262000	Because they had to put clothes on
6262000	6264000	Sofotia
6264000	6266000	And the scene where she's in the water
6266000	6268000	And Hephaestus is coming out of the water to talk to her
6268000	6270000	She's naked in the Japanese version
6270000	6272000	They had to put clothes on her in the American one
6272000	6274000	Which is
6274000	6276000	Redonkulous
6276000	6278000	And she's got her hands over her boobs so what's the big deal
6278000	6280000	Alright
6280000	6282000	Anyhow there it is your classic game of the week
6282000	6284000	Soul Blade or Soul Edge
6284000	6286000	Whatever you want to refer to it as
6286000	6288000	Alright

6318000	6320000	We are live here
6320000	6322000	On this July 10th
6322000	6324000	2011 with episode
6324000	6326000	Number 419 of our show
6326000	6328000	Which you know means next week is episode
6328000	6330000	420
6330000	6332000	Not that any of us are gonna
6332000	6334000	Do anything outside of the norm for that
6334000	6336000	Week but I just thought it was worth saying
6336000	6338000	That some of our listeners will be
6338000	6340000	But anyhow, just throwing that out there
6340000	6342000	Usually at this part of the show
6342000	6344000	We want to plug a couple of the
6344000	6346000	Side projects and other things that we're working on
6346000	6348000	I do want to go ahead and work in
6348000	6350000	One other plug quickly for the
6350000	6352000	Understation Live 10th anniversary show
6352000	6354000	That is going to be this coming Saturday
6354000	6356000	I know I'm going to be there and
6356000	6358000	Jessica Harper will be there
6358000	6360000	And we're going to be reminiscing about the good old days
6360000	6362000	At Understation Live
6362000	6364000	The show where I started
6364000	6366000	On internet radio
6366000	6368000	Although I guess you could say
6368000	6370000	I did internet radio in college but
6370000	6372000	You know, again, wax tapes
6372000	6374000	So it really started
6374000	6376000	On Understation Live
6376000	6378000	Back in 2001
6378000	6380000	Also, Hoard House is the show I do
6380000	6382000	About the world of Warcraft with my buddy
6382000	6384000	Xtopher, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth
6384000	6386000	If you are a Warcraft fan you really should check it out
6386000	6388000	www.hoardhouse.com
6388000	6390000	I got really angry on this week's show
6390000	6392000	And it has to do with getting booted from a pug
6392000	6394000	And it occurred to me
6394000	6396000	I don't know if you saw my reply to a post
6396000	6398000	On our private guild's forums
6398000	6400000	But that night I was so mad
6400000	6402000	I think you said something to me
6402000	6404000	DarkSakura, and I was like, this game can suck
6404000	6406000	My fucking dick, good night
6406000	6408000	It didn't occur to me until like two days later
6408000	6410000	I was like, oh god, did she think I said that to her?
6410000	6412000	Because I wasn't saying that to her
6412000	6414000	You said some acronym
6414000	6416000	That I didn't understand at the time
6416000	6418000	Oh
6418000	6420000	And then afterwards I was like
6420000	6422000	Oh, that's what it is
6422000	6424000	Because you said VTK'd
6424000	6426000	And I was like
6426000	6428000	Oh, vote kicked, yes
6428000	6430000	They VTK'd me
6430000	6432000	But I was like
6432000	6434000	My reply I remember was
6434000	6436000	What? And they were like, this game can suck my dick
6436000	6438000	I'm going bye
6438000	6440000	And I'm sitting there just staring at my computer
6440000	6442000	Going
6442000	6444000	Who's gonna play with me now?
6444000	6446000	I had a diva moment
6446000	6448000	Where I stormed off the set
6448000	6450000	Seriously, that's exactly what it was like
6450000	6452000	And I'm like, seriously, I sat there for ten minutes
6452000	6454000	I had time for my character to go
6454000	6456000	On away, and sit down, and pout
6456000	6458000	Aww
6458000	6460000	But I mean, I was like, I was trying to figure out what's going on
6460000	6462000	So I started looking it up online
6462000	6464000	I was emotionally raped by a guild
6464000	6466000	On another server with that vote kick
6466000	6468000	Do the troll dungeons link to other servers?
6468000	6470000	Oh yeah, they all do
6470000	6472000	I didn't know about that
6472000	6474000	Oh yeah, they all do
6474000	6476000	So be careful
6476000	6478000	Oh no, I was just gonna say
6478000	6480000	Speaking of voting the kick
6480000	6484000	Prior to the mods being patched on Grand Theft Auto
6484000	6486000	When we were playing just regular
6486000	6488000	Private matches
6488000	6490000	My co-workers usually tried to vote to kick me out of the game
6490000	6492000	Because I'd be kicking the crap out of them
6492000	6494000	I was like, vote him out
6494000	6496000	He's beaten
6496000	6498000	That's ignorant that somebody would vote kick
6498000	6500000	Just because they're good
6500000	6502000	They think it's funny
6502000	6504000	That's what I keep telling myself
6504000	6506000	That I couldn't just handle my beauty
6506000	6508000	So that's why they had to vote kick me
6508000	6510000	More information on that at Hoardhouse.com
6510000	6512000	We told you about the stupid bitch we had
6512000	6514000	In one of your groups?
6514000	6516000	Oh yeah, something like
6516000	6518000	They didn't want to heal the tank
6518000	6520000	We'll tell the story really quickly
6520000	6522000	We were at Grim Butthole
6522000	6524000	Sorry, Grim Butthole
6524000	6526000	But it's Grim Butthole
6526000	6528000	Because it sucks
6528000	6530000	We kind of wanted to skip the harder battles in there
6530000	6532000	Because they're a pain in the ass
6532000	6534000	And it's like
6534000	6536000	I just want to run through this really fast
6536000	6538000	I don't care about anybody else
6538000	6540000	And then she starts getting really foul
6540000	6542000	And then she's like
6542000	6544000	Let's vote to kick the tank
6544000	6546000	And I'm like, bitch no
6546000	6548000	I was like, do you read that all of us
6548000	6550000	Are in the same guild and you're not?
6550000	6552000	See, you should have vote kicked her
6552000	6554000	I started, I did
6554000	6556000	I requested a vote kicker three times
6556000	6558000	And it didn't pass?
6558000	6560000	It did on the third time
6560000	6562000	Because it did that delay
6562000	6564000	I was not a rude cunt
6564000	6566000	So there's a big difference
6566000	6568000	But she was, she was
6568000	6570000	I've got screen capture, she was that bad
6570000	6572000	And, okay
6572000	6574000	I'm going to tell you something everybody
6574000	6576000	And it doesn't matter if you're on World of Warcraft
6576000	6578000	Or whatever MMO that you're on
6578000	6580000	Be nice
6580000	6582000	You don't get anything from being a bitch
6582000	6584000	Or, you know
6584000	6586000	Blaming everything on the tank
6586000	6588000	Or a troll
6588000	6590000	There's so many trolls in WoW
6590000	6592000	And it's really like
6592000	6594000	What do you really get
6594000	6596000	This is masturbation for you
6596000	6598000	I can't think of anything else that
6598000	6600000	Trolling accomplishes other than
6600000	6602000	Jacking yourself off
6602000	6604000	I'm going to give a few pieces of advice
6604000	6606000	Now this is a little more specific
6606000	6608000	To WoW
6608000	6610000	I will repeat these later on for you
6610000	6612000	In a recorded version if you like
6612000	6614000	Rule number one
6614000	6616000	Don't be a dick
6616000	6618000	Rule number one of the OL army
6618000	6620000	Which I know we don't talk about that a lot
6620000	6622000	But you know we do have a steam group
6622000	6624000	We do have several gaming groups available online
6624000	6626000	You know with all the steam sale orgy stuff
6626000	6628000	Going on right now, if you're not in the OLR group
6628000	6630000	I don't know what you're doing
6630000	6632000	Cause the rule number one of the OL army
6632000	6634000	Is don't be a dick
6634000	6636000	And so you know you should come join us on steam
6636000	6638000	And more information is at OrangeLunchRadio.com
6638000	6640000	In that little extend play box on the left side
6640000	6642000	Well number two refers to how you treat your tank
6642000	6644000	It's a three strike rule
6644000	6646000	Number one
6646000	6648000	If your tank doesn't flat out say
6648000	6650000	I've never tanked this before
6650000	6652000	And they're doing a bad job, stop and explain the mechanic
6652000	6654000	To them if you happen to know it
6654000	6656000	If they still act shitty
6656000	6658000	Give them one more try and if they are just
6658000	6660000	Derpy say sorry
6660000	6662000	We need you to leave
6662000	6664000	That really doesn't just apply to tanks
6664000	6666000	I think that can go for anybody
6666000	6668000	In any MMO, it doesn't even have to be WoW
6668000	6670000	And sometimes people make mistakes like
6670000	6672000	I started using, you know when you hit V and the little life bar show up
6672000	6674000	I accidentally targeted
6674000	6676000	A creature in a group over
6676000	6678000	Because the little name tag
6678000	6680000	Was like right next to the one I was targeting
6680000	6682000	And so I made a boo boo
6682000	6684000	But I you know went and reshaped everybody
6684000	6686000	And everyone was happy
6686000	6688000	But it's just like
6688000	6690000	Don't point fingers
6690000	6692000	Don't lay blame
6692000	6694000	If someone is truly bad
6694000	6696000	A good party will hold them through it
6696000	6698000	If they are being bad on purpose
6698000	6700000	Then say sorry you need to practice this one
6700000	6702000	A little bit more, play with your guildies for a bit
6702000	6704000	Because I played with
6704000	6706000	I will not be in a party unless there is one other guildie with me
6706000	6708000	I just won't do it
6708000	6710000	I did it once though on my first troll heroic
6710000	6712000	But anyway
6712000	6714000	My third rule
6714000	6716000	If you are not on your game
6716000	6718000	You need to step back
6718000	6720000	Don't blame somebody else
6720000	6722000	For what you are doing wrong
6722000	6724000	Like for example I will use me from the other day
6724000	6726000	I was getting motion sick after
6726000	6728000	While you were playing with us
6728000	6730000	And we were an all guild group
6730000	6732000	And when we got people from outside
6732000	6734000	The guild after you had to log off
6734000	6736000	Because you weren't feeling well
6736000	6738000	I had to stop playing because I couldn't take breaks
6738000	6740000	Because I was getting motion sick
6740000	6742000	Or if I'm having a bad night
6742000	6744000	I'll say you know what I'm just not into this
6744000	6746000	I'm going to have to back out because I'm holding everyone back
6746000	6748000	You need to be able to say
6748000	6750000	To take enough responsibility on yourself
6750000	6752000	That you're not going to ruin somebody else's good time
6752000	6754000	So those are
6754000	6756000	My three rules for playing with other people
6756000	6758000	Words of sage wisdom
6758000	6760000	From an OMG real life girl
6760000	6762000	Yes
6762000	6764000	Speaking of MMOs
6764000	6766000	I can't remember if I told this story last week
6766000	6768000	So stop me if I'm repeating myself
6768000	6770000	I'm getting old and I forget an old age
6770000	6772000	Salacious Pop did a really big troll on me
6772000	6774000	Because of the Steam sale that's going on
6774000	6776000	I was mentioning just off hand something about
6776000	6778000	I wonder what Final Fantasy 11
6778000	6780000	Is like these days
6780000	6782000	You know gosh I'd be really curious
6782000	6784000	What's going on in 11 these days
6784000	6786000	Steam you have been gifted
6786000	6788000	A copy of Final Fantasy 11
6788000	6790000	The complete Uber edition
6790000	6792000	Including the new Abyssia expansion
6792000	6794000	It's 11 bucks
6794000	6796000	I know I look over at Alan
6796000	6798000	And I go like you're such a fucking troll
6798000	6800000	So
6800000	6802000	That is actually downloading at home right now
6802000	6804000	Not that I'm going to log in and play right away
6804000	6806000	But yeah
6806000	6808000	I do have 30 days of that that I can check out at some point
6808000	6810000	Oh mine finally finished I downloaded
6810000	6812000	Champions
6812000	6814000	Oh you downloaded Champions the free
6814000	6816000	You know what
6816000	6818000	If someone gave me $11
6818000	6820000	So I could get Final Fantasy 11 Rob I would play with you
6820000	6822000	Just to see
6822000	6824000	How lolsy it is now
6824000	6826000	But somebody has to give you
6826000	6828000	$11 good luck on that
6828000	6830000	Or just send it to me on Steam
6830000	6832000	It's so easy now
6832000	6834000	Alright
6834000	6836000	Dan's in the other room saying no more momos
6836000	6838000	No more momos but it's only 30
6838000	6840000	Days Dan
6840000	6842000	That's
6842000	6844000	He's yelling
6844000	6846000	That's how Warcraft started
6846000	6848000	And then he goes fucking Rob
6848000	6850000	Yeah I know I know
6850000	6852000	Alright let's move on
6852000	6854000	We need to do some rapid fire news
6854000	6856000	And talk about some other stuff going on
6856000	6858000	Instagaming world
6858000	6860000	Loki
6860000	6862000	Speaking of Final Fantasy
6862000	6864000	There's a Final Fantasy game coming to the 3DS
6864000	6866000	Although this may not be the Final Fantasy game you're looking for
6866000	6868000	It's Final Fantasy
6868000	6870000	Um
6870000	6872000	Why did I have to make these like really ridiculous
6872000	6874000	Fake names
6874000	6876000	The rhythm I guess
6876000	6878000	The rhythm
6878000	6880000	It's like theater rhythm mixed together
6880000	6882000	Anyways
6882000	6884000	It is a rhythm
6884000	6886000	Game for Final Fantasy
6886000	6888000	So your combat is done
6888000	6890000	The kind of
6890000	6892000	Rhythm stuff
6892000	6894000	Now Cloud can dance like never before
6894000	6896000	Funny that you should mention Cloud
6896000	6898000	Because actually I think I see someone
6898000	6900000	In that picture that looks very similar
6900000	6902000	I'm just imagining Bust A Move songs
6902000	6904000	In my head with the characters replaced
6904000	6906000	With uh
6906000	6908000	Cloud and it's really funny to me I don't know why
6908000	6910000	Um yeah it looks kind of neat
6910000	6912000	I like rhythm games I like Final Fantasy so maybe
6912000	6914000	I check it out but um yeah I mean for
6914000	6916000	People looking for like a Final Fantasy RPG
6916000	6918000	That's brand new and everything
6918000	6920000	Um not quite what you're looking for here
6920000	6922000	So but I check it out
6922000	6924000	Looks kind of neat
6924000	6926000	New fanboy worlds colliding
6926000	6928000	Pretty much yeah
6928000	6930000	And then on top of that Harmonics is of course
6930000	6932000	Working on a new IP called Vithrhythm
6932000	6934000	And that's literally all we know about that
6934000	6936000	Um
6936000	6938000	They've just confirmed yeah there's something that we
6938000	6940000	Can add to it at this time but
6940000	6942000	Yes we are working on that project
6942000	6944000	So maybe a new
6944000	6946000	Res type game or something like that
6946000	6948000	That'd be kind of neat we'll see
6948000	6950000	Um
6950000	6952000	And then finally this is kind of neat
6952000	6954000	Rockstar is um
6954000	6956000	Trademarked uh Rockstar Films
6956000	6958000	And um
6958000	6960000	Apparently you know one of the
6960000	6962000	People are thinking hey you know what uh
6962000	6964000	They did mention one time that if someone was gonna
6964000	6966000	Make Grand Theft Auto into a movie
6966000	6968000	That it would it would be them
6968000	6970000	Um you know
6970000	6972000	They said that they would be the ones that would want to
6972000	6974000	Handle that um
6974000	6976000	So maybe we'll see some movies coming from
6976000	6978000	Actually you know I could see something like
6978000	6980000	Uh you know maybe like LA Noire
6980000	6982000	Or something like that as a movie from them
6982000	6984000	Cause um you know it's a little bit more
6984000	6986000	Of a linear story
6986000	6988000	Grand Theft Auto would be a little bit kind of crazy
6988000	6990000	I don't know if they could do that but um
6990000	6992000	Neat
6992000	6994000	You know they'd be turning some of their games into uh
6994000	6996000	Movies
6996000	6998000	Neat
6998000	7000000	Which would you rather have first a Grand Theft Auto movie
7000000	7002000	Or a Red Dead Redemption movie
7002000	7004000	Cause I would think Red Dead Redemption would make a better movie
7004000	7006000	I agree that's just me
7006000	7008000	Of course
7008000	7010000	Cause usually I beat you here to the show
7010000	7012000	So I don't see your car pull up
7012000	7014000	A whole lot but tonight I was late thanks to an accident
7014000	7016000	So um I pull up behind
7016000	7018000	You and I never realized you had a license plate frame
7018000	7020000	That said I'd rather be playing Grand Theft Auto
7020000	7022000	Yes I got that a few months back
7022000	7024000	It's nice
7024000	7026000	Alright uh some other quick
7026000	7028000	News here uh an interesting spinoff
7028000	7030000	Of the Burnout series that's coming to
7030000	7032000	Xbox Live Arcade, Burnout
7032000	7034000	Crash apparently is coming out
7034000	7036000	By interesting you mean terrible
7036000	7038000	The thing that's interesting about it to me
7038000	7040000	Is it's that whole like top down look
7040000	7042000	It looks like
7042000	7044000	Remember
7044000	7046000	Ivan Ironman Stewart's
7046000	7048000	Super Offroad
7048000	7050000	That every round table pizza
7050000	7052000	I guess that's a west coast thing but every pizza
7052000	7054000	Joint I guess across the nation had
7054000	7056000	In their little arcade that game was
7056000	7058000	Fucking bad ass
7058000	7060000	Yeah this looks like one of those type of
7060000	7062000	Games but it's fucking Burnout so I don't
7062000	7064000	Actually this looks kind of rad
7064000	7066000	I didn't look at the trailer so let me
7066000	7068000	Let me look at the trailer cause maybe it is kind of poopy
7068000	7070000	If I see it in motion
7070000	7072000	Well they have two different trailers
7072000	7074000	What the?
7074000	7076000	No I do not like the look of freshly colored hair
7076000	7078000	Yes see that's the thing about joystick
7078000	7080000	Is they always have commercials for like
7080000	7082000	Hair products for like women
7082000	7084000	That is like the such wrong demographic
7084000	7086000	I can't wait until I see a douche
7086000	7088000	Commercial come up
7088000	7090000	That and like you know hey
7090000	7092000	Your children are visiting the internet
7092000	7094000	They could use AOL's blah blah blah
7094000	7096000	To lock down the internet for them
7096000	7098000	Do you have Rampant Vaginitis?
7098000	7100000	I don't know if
7100000	7102000	This trailer is going to show gameplay cause they had a
7102000	7104000	Teaser one that didn't have any gameplay in it
7104000	7106000	But the gameplay trailer
7106000	7108000	Or a little preview
7108000	7110000	Not good
7110000	7112000	Let me do the YouTube thing instead of like trying to go to a
7112000	7114000	Gaming news website I'll just go direct to YouTube
7114000	7116000	But anyways
7116000	7118000	Crash time it's
7118000	7120000	Basically you know the crash mode
7120000	7122000	That they had in the other games
7122000	7124000	Which hey you know what if they wanted to bring that over
7124000	7126000	Into it's own game and make it look like the regular
7126000	7128000	Burnout games but just be all the crash mode
7128000	7130000	I'd be fine with that
7136000	7138000	This is an Xbox Live Arcade game right?
7138000	7140000	It also supports Kinect
7140000	7142000	Notice the hopping up and down icon
7142000	7144000	Right there yes in order to make cars explode
7144000	7146000	You have to hop up and down
7146000	7148000	I can turn that bullshit off right?
7148000	7150000	Oh fuck it I won't play with that
7150000	7152000	Blow up the pizza truck
7152000	7154000	This looks like Super Sprint mixed with
7154000	7156000	Burnout I think this is actually kind of rad looking
7160000	7162000	Of course there's not a lot going on right now
7162000	7164000	This would be better if they were like actually driving faster
7164000	7166000	Or something It's got fire
7166000	7168000	Instead of just causing like a 20 car pileup
7168000	7170000	Well that's the point see the car pileups
7170000	7172000	Or whatever in the destruction it causes
7172000	7174000	Your little meter to build up
7174000	7176000	And then you can explode your car Oh that's like
7176000	7178000	There was a mode like that in one of the older Burnout games
7178000	7180000	Yeah crash mode that's what this is based off
7180000	7182000	But that's the thing though
7182000	7184000	I really wish it was in that format
7184000	7186000	And not necessarily this because the
7186000	7188000	Kinect functionality they have it where you drive the car
7188000	7190000	Like you make the 10 and 2
7190000	7192000	Steering wheel motions or whatever
7192000	7194000	And then you have the hop up and down to make your car explode
7194000	7196000	Which I hate I played that racing game
7196000	7198000	It's terrible
7198000	7200000	Just don't like it anyhow
7200000	7202000	One game I do like is Torchlight and Runic
7202000	7204000	Games announced that Torchlight surpassed a million
7204000	7206000	Units sold
7206000	7208000	This would be across the PC the Mac and the 360
7208000	7210000	They haven't said how much on what system
7210000	7212000	But considering it has been discounted on Steam several times
7212000	7214000	I'm pretty sure that helped
7214000	7216000	Just like it helped sell Lady Gaga
7216000	7218000	A million albums when Amazon sold it for 99 cents
7218000	7220000	Anyhow
7220000	7222000	Runic is right now
7222000	7224000	Working on Torchlight 2
7224000	7226000	They are still targeting 2011
7226000	7228000	For the launch but they won't allow
7228000	7230000	Announce a release date until Runic
7230000	7232000	Is closer to being done
7232000	7234000	You can tell that the employees were from
7234000	7236000	Blizzard a big chunk of them because
7236000	7238000	Blizzard does that same damn thing where it's like
7238000	7240000	It will come out when it's ready
7240000	7242000	Kojima Hideo Kojima
7242000	7244000	Of course known for the Metal Gear
7244000	7246000	Series but also known for
7246000	7248000	A series that was popular in Japan
7248000	7250000	Snatcher which kind of has a cult following here
7250000	7252000	Announced
7252000	7254000	On the latest edition of his Hideo
7254000	7256000	Radio podcast
7256000	7258000	Apparently he is going back
7258000	7260000	To something he had announced
7260000	7262000	Several years ago but nothing ever came of it
7262000	7264000	He's basically re-announced that
7264000	7266000	A radio drama
7266000	7268000	Inspired by the 1998
7268000	7270000	Cyberpunk game Snatcher
7270000	7272000	That's been scripted by Suda51
7272000	7274000	Called S.D. Atcher
7274000	7276000	It's kind of a spin on
7276000	7278000	Suda51's name
7278000	7280000	This is the team up
7280000	7282000	Project S thing
7282000	7284000	It's a radio drama
7284000	7286000	It will be released to coincide with the 300th
7286000	7288000	Episode of Hideo Radio
7288000	7290000	And Akira Yomoka is going to be doing
7290000	7292000	The music
7292000	7294000	Judging by the fact that they're on episode 296
7294000	7296000	Now you'll be able to find this episode
7296000	7298000	300. They come out bi-weekly
7298000	7300000	So 300 will be in about what
7300000	7302000	2 months?
7302000	7304000	Kind of interesting
7304000	7306000	I'm sure
7306000	7308000	Snatcher fans will be very happy to hear that one
7308000	7310000	Quite
7310000	7312000	Dark Sakura
7312000	7314000	In other news we do have
7314000	7316000	Some costumes for LittleBigPlanet2
7316000	7318000	The Final Fantasy 7 pack
7318000	7320000	There's going to be
7320000	7322000	From what I can see on here we have
7322000	7324000	Aerith, who cares, Tifa
7324000	7326000	We have Vincent, yay, Cloud
7326000	7328000	And Sephiroth
7328000	7330000	Well if you have Aerith you can just jump her off a cliff over and over
7330000	7332000	No, if you've got Aerith you just have to
7332000	7334000	Stab her over and over
7334000	7336000	Or just hold the square and watch her head explode
7336000	7338000	Because remember in LittleBigPlanet2 you can explode
7338000	7340000	Your little guy
7340000	7342000	That, okay, that makes it worth it
7342000	7344000	The Sephiroth one's kind of funny
7344000	7346000	Looking for the record
7346000	7348000	And then, now I actually
7348000	7350000	Saw the trailer for this
7350000	7352000	In the theater
7352000	7354000	For Tekken Blood Vengeance
7354000	7356000	And I was like this looks really cool
7356000	7358000	I'm going to see that
7358000	7360000	It does look awesome
7360000	7362000	It is a one night only US showing
7362000	7364000	That's going to be before the Japanese release
7364000	7366000	By a little over a month
7366000	7368000	And it has 20 minutes of interviews with the Tekken staff
7368000	7370000	Including
7370000	7372000	The screenwriter
7372000	7374000	Dai Sato
7374000	7376000	He also was behind Cowboy Bebop
7376000	7378000	Is this going to be one of those horrible
7378000	7380000	Live events at the theater things
7380000	7382000	That you always see the commercials for
7382000	7384000	Like the whole like, see Coldplay
7384000	7386000	Take the stage at Madison Square Garden
7386000	7388000	At your local theater
7388000	7390000	It is like one of those
7390000	7392000	No, you get to see the movie
7392000	7394000	No, no, I know, I know
7394000	7396000	Don't you ever see the commercials at the movies
7396000	7398000	For these things that are like
7398000	7400000	Well those are Fathom events
7400000	7402000	A night at the Metropolitan
7402000	7404000	And they are going to be doing
7404000	7406000	It is the same thing
7406000	7408000	It's very limited theater
7408000	7410000	They've done other anime
7410000	7412000	Things like they did the Death Note movie
7412000	7414000	And the live action Death Note movie
7414000	7416000	And stuff like that
7416000	7418000	Rob, we went to see Escaflowne
7418000	7420000	I didn't go to that
7420000	7422000	I thought you went with us to see Escaflowne
7422000	7424000	I remember a bunch of people went to that
7424000	7426000	I've never seen it
7426000	7428000	They'll probably do this with the Try Again movie when it comes out
7428000	7430000	I also saw, you know
7430000	7432000	I've seen a bunch of movies
7432000	7434000	Like I saw Perfect Blue in the theater
7434000	7436000	You went to see Perfect Blue with me, that was it
7436000	7438000	No, I didn't have seen that either
7438000	7440000	I don't think, there's not a lot of animes I've seen in the theater
7440000	7442000	I saw Howl's Moving Castle
7442000	7444000	You've seen Requiem for a Dream, haven't you?
7444000	7446000	No
7446000	7448000	But that's like Salacious Pop's favorite movie
7448000	7450000	Yeah, but the guy was a fan of the director of Perfect Blue
7450000	7452000	Oh
7452000	7454000	Yeah, anyway
7454000	7456000	He actually fully ripped a scene from it
7456000	7460000	There's totally a new Studio Ghibli film coming out in a couple weeks in Japan
7460000	7462000	I had no idea
7462000	7464000	There's actually one that just came out already out there
7464000	7466000	But I want it to come out here really desperately
7466000	7468000	It's called Kurigurashi no Arieti
7468000	7470000	Which is the borrower
7470000	7472000	Arieti from the books The Borrowers
7472000	7474000	I think that's, no that's not it
7474000	7476000	A little tiny girl
7476000	7478000	Like the Littles
7478000	7480000	And they live in this old house and this sick boy goes live there
7480000	7482000	And he makes friends with her and everything
7482000	7484000	But the soundtrack is done by
7484000	7486000	A Breton singer
7486000	7488000	Anyway, I'm sorry, I'm digressing
7488000	7490000	But no, this is
7490000	7492000	I'm gonna see the movie
7492000	7494000	I really wanna see the movie
7494000	7496000	Because I am a huge Tekken fangirl
7496000	7498000	But it's all CG
7498000	7500000	So it's gonna be really cool
7500000	7502000	And it's gonna be on July 26th
7502000	7504000	And then it will be six hours
7504000	7506000	Of gorgeous Tekken
7506000	7508000	Gooey mess
7508000	7510000	You know what, for OLR's 10th anniversary show
7510000	7512000	I think we should hook up with Fathom Events
7512000	7514000	And make it a one night
7514000	7516000	In the theater special
7516000	7518000	And Dark Soccer will just have to deal with being on the big screen
7518000	7520000	I don't know how expensive that is
7520000	7522000	But I know that they do that for riff tracks
7522000	7524000	Do they?
7524000	7526000	It's expensive, but I think it's moderately expensive
7526000	7528000	Okay, OLR me
7528000	7530000	Call your local theater and demand the
7530000	7532000	OLR 10th anniversary special
7532000	7534000	To come to Fathom Events
7534000	7536000	I'll have a mask made
7536000	7538000	That would be weird
7538000	7540000	I don't know
7540000	7542000	We're packing theaters alright
7542000	7544000	You hear what person?
7544000	7546000	Now that we've sat you down
7546000	7548000	And you've paid $10 to come see
7548000	7550000	Our big mugs in your local movie theater
7550000	7552000	We thought, what should we do that's special
7552000	7554000	For this 10th anniversary show
7554000	7556000	Ferret Vision 3D
7556000	7558000	So we're gonna have Extrofer bleaches asshole
7558000	7560000	Live right in front of you on the camera
7560000	7562000	Who will have an X rating?
7562000	7564000	It'll be made X for
7564000	7566000	Extrofer's bleached asshole
7566000	7568000	It'll be like the time that Katie Couric got her colonoscopy
7568000	7570000	On the Today show, come on
7570000	7572000	Anyway, in other news
7572000	7574000	Resident Evil
7574000	7576000	HD versions are gonna be coming out
7576000	7578000	On Xbox, on Xbox 360
7578000	7580000	We will have Code Veronica
7580000	7582000	X and Resident Evil 4
7582000	7584000	And they will have a thousand
7584000	7586000	Achievement points, ooh
7586000	7588000	So
7588000	7590000	Yay
7590000	7592000	But it's going to have
7592000	7594000	Here's some of the achievements for Code Veronica
7594000	7596000	There's The Terror Begins, Escape from the
7596000	7598000	Graveyard of Terror, A Change Father
7598000	7600000	Liberate the Change Man
7600000	7602000	There's Once for Encountering Former Stars Captain
7602000	7604000	So basically it's stuff that happens in the game anyway
7604000	7606000	Um
7606000	7608000	And uh
7608000	7610000	Actually, there's a comparison up
7610000	7612000	Of the uh
7612000	7614000	You just have to look around on the internet, but there's a
7614000	7616000	Comparison between Resident Evil 4
7616000	7618000	The original, and uh
7618000	7620000	The HD version
7620000	7622000	Since I don't have my GameCube hooked up anymore
7622000	7624000	Or my, I mean I can always use the Wii, but my friends
7624000	7626000	Borrowed Resident Evil 4
7626000	7628000	Like, I'm actually really interested in this
7628000	7630000	Cause unlike some people in the room, I really liked
7630000	7632000	Resident Evil 4
7632000	7634000	I didn't dislike Resident Evil 4, but I loved Code Veronica
7634000	7636000	And I liked the second one best
7636000	7638000	Ah, alright
7638000	7640000	Because the two that were supposed to look like
7640000	7642000	Leonardo DiCaprio, totally got killed
7642000	7644000	Akuma JP in the chat room
7644000	7646000	Is asking, will I be able to save
7646000	7648000	Yes
7648000	7650000	You just will not be able to erase those saves
7650000	7652000	As long as you have enough typewriter ribbon
7652000	7654000	That's the
7654000	7656000	Perfect answer, DarkSakura
7656000	7658000	Perfect answer
7658000	7660000	I'm actually going to link the articles in the chat room
7660000	7662000	So people can watch the comparison
7662000	7664000	Amazing
7664000	7666000	Tweet time! Twitter.com slash
7666000	7668000	OLR if you want to send us your tweets
7668000	7670000	As our listeners do every week
7670000	7672000	And we will go through some of those tweets right now
7672000	7674000	And uh, let's see
7674000	7676000	First off, I want to do a tweet
7676000	7678000	From Mad Gear Store
7678000	7680000	Who tweeted a bunch of people
7680000	7682000	Who did a nice game selection in California Extreme
7682000	7684000	And tweeted us a picture of some of the
7684000	7686000	Um, Bamani that was going up there
7686000	7688000	And I gotta say, I'm actually kinda sad
7688000	7690000	I'm actually, well I'm not kind of sad
7690000	7692000	I'm really sad that actually I missed California Extreme
7692000	7694000	It just, it was just on a bad
7694000	7696000	Weekend this year, I had a lot going on
7696000	7698000	This weekend you guys
7698000	7700000	And I think the others did too, and it's just hard
7700000	7702000	I could have gone this morning
7702000	7704000	But I couldn't have justified paying
7704000	7706000	30 bucks and only being there about 4 hours
7706000	7708000	Which is what would have happened
7708000	7710000	So I would have wanted to be there yesterday
7710000	7712000	Like all night long
7712000	7714000	So, unfortunately I couldn't make that happen
7714000	7716000	Blue Swim tweeted us earlier in the week
7716000	7718000	Going, I usually listen to podcasts
7718000	7720000	As I'm going to sleep
7720000	7722000	Had several episodes of OLR playing
7722000	7724000	And I ended up dreaming about them
7724000	7726000	Is that creepy that people like dream of us
7726000	7728000	We didn't hear what was in the dream
7728000	7730000	Hopefully it wasn't an erotic dream
7730000	7732000	I dare not
7734000	7736000	I don't think it was
7736000	7738000	Redertainment sent a tweet earlier
7738000	7740000	I actually responded to it, but I wanted to bring it up
7740000	7742000	On the show, and Redertainment asked
7742000	7744000	So when are you going to incorporate
7744000	7746000	Google Plus into the show
7746000	7748000	This is the new social network everyone's talking about
7748000	7750000	We like to be on the cutting edge
7750000	7752000	Of those types of things
7752000	7754000	As soon as we find a way
7754000	7756000	To do it, we will
7756000	7758000	Google has actually asked that small and medium
7758000	7760000	Businesses stop making personal profiles
7760000	7762000	Because they will roll out
7762000	7764000	A business thing, kind of like how
7764000	7766000	Facebook has business pages
7766000	7768000	They're going to roll that out later in the year, I guess
7768000	7770000	So as long as we can do it for free
7770000	7772000	Or like, really cheap
7772000	7774000	We're going to look at doing something like that
7774000	7776000	Where we can keep our fans posted
7776000	7778000	Assuming that Google Plus has something you want
7778000	7780000	And you know, we're gamers like you
7780000	7782000	And if this whole thing ends up being
7782000	7784000	Spam, spamity, spam, spam
7784000	7786000	We wouldn't do that, we're not going to contribute to that
7786000	7788000	But, you know, if it's a place where you can
7788000	7790000	Be in a community and talk about games
7790000	7792000	And, you know, meet other people that don't want to be
7792000	7794000	Jerks on playing online games
7794000	7796000	Then I'm all for that
7796000	7798000	But Google Plus, its biggest
7798000	7800000	Problem right now is that there's not
7800000	7802000	A lot there, like you can see
7802000	7804000	What they're building, and a lot of people
7804000	7806000	Are really liking what they see in the foundation
7806000	7808000	But there's certainly a lot of other people
7808000	7810000	Who look at Google Plus and go
7810000	7812000	There's fucking nothing there right now, it's so vanilla
7812000	7814000	So, I think
7814000	7816000	Google Plus just needs some time to grow
7816000	7818000	And then we can really see what we can do with it
7818000	7822000	Uh, mnziba
7822000	7824000	Are you alright there?
7824000	7826000	Are you alright? Is a bug attacking you?
7826000	7828000	Is a fly attacking you for massive damage?
7828000	7830000	Hit its weak point
7830000	7832000	There you go, she got a Kleenex
7832000	7834000	And hit its weak point
7834000	7836000	Squished it to death
7836000	7838000	I broke one of its wings
7838000	7840000	Yikes, mnziba sends us a tweet
7840000	7842000	Saying, this video made me go back to
7842000	7844000	FFXI or Final Fantasy 11
7844000	7846000	How many of these scenes have you seen in game?
7846000	7848000	So I'm looking at a little
7848000	7850000	A little scenery
7850000	7852000	A little quaint scene
7852000	7854000	Of plants growing
7854000	7856000	I don't know what this is
7856000	7858000	It's supposed to be like a garden, I gotta skip ahead a little bit
7858000	7860000	I think it's just some of the
7860000	7862000	Pretty shit in game
7862000	7864000	Sent to pretty music
7864000	7866000	You know what?
7866000	7868000	I gotta say, it's funny
7868000	7870000	You know, you sent this tweet before I told my story
7870000	7872000	At the top of the break about how I got FFXI
7872000	7874000	Bought for me, but it actually was
7874000	7876000	Thinking about a lot of the great scenery
7876000	7878000	And ambiance in that game
7878000	7880000	Despite the dated graphical technology
7880000	7882000	That had me thinking like
7882000	7884000	I wonder what it looks like now
7884000	7886000	I wonder if they've made some changes
7886000	7888000	And why FFXIV was so fucking disappointing
7888000	7890000	Because it should have been
7890000	7892000	11 improved in high def
7892000	7894000	But instead it was 11
7894000	7896000	Flushed down a toilet in high def
7896000	7898000	And that was what was very disappointing about it
7900000	7902000	Redertainment sent us another tweet saying
7902000	7904000	I'd like to start the rumor that the PlayStation 4
7904000	7906000	Will feature Body Movin', the hit song
7906000	7908000	From the Beastie Boys
7908000	7910000	Get it? Because it rips off the connect
7910000	7912000	Get it?
7912000	7914000	Spazernator tweets us and says
7914000	7916000	No news on free PlayStation Network videos
7916000	7918000	For a while with the fact that my system being
7918000	7920000	Dead and needing to be repaired
7920000	7922000	Yeah, I heard about this, I guess he got the yellow
7922000	7924000	Lie to death on the PlayStation
7924000	7926000	And he does not have good luck with PlayStation
7928000	7930000	Yet he supports someone
7930000	7932000	I know, rude Sony
7932000	7934000	Rude, rude Sony
7934000	7936000	Sj100matt tweets us
7936000	7938000	Has Hollywood really run out of ideas?
7938000	7940000	The Space Invaders movie rights
7940000	7942000	Have been optioned
7942000	7944000	And tweets us to a story
7944000	7946000	I thought this had already happened some time ago
7946000	7948000	But it's making the rounds again
7948000	7950000	The Taito classic arcade game
7950000	7952000	Space Invaders has been optioned
7952000	7954000	By veteran Hollywood producers
7954000	7956000	The film rights were optioned by
7956000	7958000	Lorenzo de Beneventura
7958000	7960000	Who made Transformers, G.I. Joe
7960000	7962000	and Salt and Odd Lot
7962000	7964000	Entertainment who is behind
7964000	7966000	Upcoming movies Drive and Ender's Game
7966000	7968000	I guess they've
7968000	7970000	Also optioned Asteroids
7970000	7972000	Ah, I see
7972000	7974000	Last year Warner Brothers allegedly
7974000	7976000	Was seeking the Space Invaders rights itself
7976000	7978000	But that venture fell through
7978000	7980000	Where would you make a fucking
7980000	7982000	Movie out of Space Invaders?
7982000	7984000	Like, wouldn't it just be Independence
7984000	7986000	Day but called Space Invaders?
7986000	7988000	Yes, they're never gonna make a better alien
7988000	7990000	Film than Independence Day
7990000	7992000	But the soundtrack would be
7992000	7994000	Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
7994000	7996000	No, well, the new Space Invaders game
7996000	7998000	Has had fucking rad soundtracks
7998000	8000000	Like, that would be cool
8000000	8002000	How about techno rave version of Independence Day?
8002000	8004000	There you go
8004000	8006000	Today is our Independence Day
8006000	8008000	Ooh, ooh
8012000	8014000	DJ Rama S sent us a tweet
8014000	8016000	About Pac-Man to become a reality show
8016000	8018000	Didn't this come up on last week's show?
8018000	8020000	I have a little question mark over my head
8020000	8022000	I guess I'll quickly read this
8022000	8024000	But I guess Pac-Man is coming to life with a new
8024000	8026000	Reality series
8026000	8028000	Merv Griffin Entertainment is developing an unscripted show
8028000	8030000	About the pellet eating yellow blob
8030000	8032000	Chased by Inky Binky Pinky and Clyde
8032000	8034000	It's to coincide with the 30th anniversary
8034000	8036000	Of the video game
8036000	8038000	It's a big, crazy, wipe out
8038000	8040000	Type event with a lot of energy
8040000	8042000	The idea we have is to take what Pac-Man
8042000	8044000	Is and bring it to life
8044000	8046000	To bring what is essentially the world's biggest game
8046000	8048000	Of tagged television
8048000	8050000	Sounds like a game show
8050000	8052000	They say a reality show
8052000	8054000	Like a game show
8054000	8056000	I consider Wipeout a game show more than a reality show
8056000	8058000	You know
8058000	8060000	At first when I read the headline
8060000	8062000	Pac-Man to become a reality show
8062000	8064000	Now I hear Pac-Man to become a game show
8064000	8066000	And if it's done right
8066000	8068000	It might actually be kind of cool
8068000	8070000	Isn't there some show coming to NBC
8070000	8072000	Like take the money and run or something
8072000	8074000	That's supposed to be like people have 48 hours
8074000	8076000	To hide $100,000
8076000	8078000	And if they can keep the money
8078000	8080000	Hidden from the feds for 48 hours
8080000	8082000	Or something like that like actual federal agents
8082000	8084000	That try to chase them down and the money
8084000	8086000	For themselves because the fed agents are competing
8086000	8088000	For the money like if they can find it in 48 hours
8088000	8090000	And they get to keep it and I'm like that
8090000	8092000	Sounds kind of awesome like
8092000	8094000	I like shows about like
8094000	8096000	That type of stuff I would do that
8096000	8098000	You would do how would you hide the money
8098000	8100000	How would you win that show
8100000	8102000	You package it up
8102000	8104000	Send it second day air
8104000	8106000	To somewhere
8106000	8108000	To your house or something like that
8108000	8110000	But couldn't the federal agents like trace
8110000	8112000	Everywhere you've been and your steps
8112000	8114000	And the packages you've sent
8114000	8116000	You immediately invest it
8116000	8118000	You immediately invest the money
8118000	8120000	Well I'm sure there's rules
8120000	8122000	You probably have to physically hide the money somewhere
8122000	8124000	I'm guessing
8124000	8126000	I don't know it's just something
8126000	8128000	Like capturing the concept of the show
8128000	8130000	But I don't know it sounds kind of awesome
8130000	8132000	There was another show I don't think it was out here
8132000	8134000	But I think it was in um
8134000	8136000	Britain or something called Jailbreak
8136000	8138000	That was just about like whoever could
8138000	8140000	Escape from jail first won like
8140000	8142000	Obscene amount of money
8142000	8144000	And who's seen too many Steve McQueen movies
8144000	8146000	I'll tell you what I'm
8146000	8148000	Look I'm a game show addict
8148000	8150000	I grew up on like old school match game
8150000	8152000	And USA network game shows like Scrabble
8152000	8154000	And pressure luck and all that shit like
8154000	8156000	That shit was awesome
8156000	8158000	But I'll tell you my favorite reality
8158000	8160000	Game show they ever did
8160000	8162000	Ever ever it's not
8162000	8164000	Survivor it's not Big Brother I think the best
8164000	8166000	Like reality game show they ever did was The Mole
8166000	8168000	When it was hosted by Anderson Cooper
8168000	8170000	Like back in the day it was like a fucking
8170000	8172000	James Bond game yeah it was like
8172000	8174000	Ten players yet one of them
8174000	8176000	Fred Savage would show up with a mole on his face
8176000	8178000	No no not that kind of mole I know
8178000	8180000	But one player was working against the other
8180000	8182000	Players they brought it back for a revival
8182000	8184000	Series a couple years ago but it wasn't as good
8184000	8186000	Well then they had the celebrity mole and then they had another
8186000	8188000	Real mole but it wasn't as good cause Anderson Cooper
8188000	8190000	Like made that show
8190000	8192000	Cause he's just the man but it was like James Bond
8192000	8194000	And I would like
8194000	8196000	I'd kill someone to be on that
8196000	8198000	Show not literally I'd kill a fly like
8198000	8200000	Dark Soccer just did I'd do that I didn't just
8200000	8202000	Kill it Rob I squished it and pinched it
8202000	8204000	You torched it I hate
8204000	8206000	No I hate flies and now keep in mind I usually comfort myself
8206000	8208000	By saying they'll die in two days anyway because
8208000	8210000	They have a really short lifespan but this
8210000	8212000	Fly has been buzzing all over my damn house
8212000	8214000	So I have a feeling of accomplishment
8214000	8216000	And satisfaction and damn it I deserve
8216000	8218000	Twinkie
8218000	8220000	Alright we have a lot of
8220000	8222000	Fucking tweets today but I gotta get through some of these
8222000	8224000	Others okay Sturlock tweets us and now
8224000	8226000	Remember I said I wanted to hear from blind gamers
8226000	8228000	Sturlock I know is a blind gamer and tweets
8228000	8230000	Us about the whole glasses story from part A
8230000	8232000	The glasses thing is actually pretty neat
8232000	8234000	Don't have enough usable vision
8234000	8236000	For that but like the concept so
8236000	8238000	Unfortunately you know it's not
8238000	8240000	Gonna work for everybody but
8240000	8242000	It's still cool that it will help
8242000	8244000	Some people I think that's still really cool
8244000	8246000	And I think Sturlock sees that too
8246000	8248000	Tigerclaw305

8300000	8302000	All these people like little avatars
8302000	8304000	And they're jumping around like
8304000	8306000	It looks like a 2D
8306000	8308000	Platformer game
8310000	8312000	There's something
8312000	8314000	LittleBigPlanet-ish about this
8314000	8316000	To me
8316000	8318000	I'm not saying that's what the game is
8318000	8320000	It's just
8320000	8324000	LittleBigPlanet on mushrooms
8326000	8328000	There was a wheel
8328000	8330000	And I quickly caught the text
8330000	8332000	On that and it said booty prize
8332000	8334000	I said booty
8334000	8336000	Anyway
8336000	8338000	It looks a little silly
8338000	8340000	That's kind of cool
8340000	8342000	I guess if it's free
8342000	8344000	I'll check it out but if it's not
8344000	8346000	I'll have to hear more about it
8346000	8348000	To see if it's worth it
8348000	8350000	Here's a question from Tigerclaw
8350000	8352000	Nintendo researching mobile phone possibilities
8352000	8354000	That's kind of a big deal
8354000	8356000	How did I miss that one?
8356000	8358000	Think about it guys
8358000	8360000	Let's see
8360000	8362000	Satoru Iwata responded to a fantastic question
8362000	8364000	Pitched at a recent shareholder Q&A that began
8364000	8366000	I own some shares but I do not have any Nintendo products
8366000	8368000	Basically I think games are a waste of time
8368000	8370000	And therefore I would like a product that has value
8370000	8372000	Added to it so that even I would buy one
8372000	8374000	Let's see
8374000	8376000	If we had never considered combining a mobile phone
8376000	8378000	We would be negligent
8378000	8380000	But on the other hand mobile phones are subject to monthly fees
8380000	8382000	And we need to consider how well this would fit with game devices
8382000	8384000	Or how we should balance these aspects
8384000	8386000	According to this mobile phone companies
8386000	8388000	Are generally divided by countries
8388000	8390000	And when running a business on a worldwide basis
8390000	8392000	We need to consider in what conditions
8392000	8394000	Can we partner up with mobile phone companies
8394000	8396000	Around the world
8396000	8398000	Please understand that we are still researching these areas
8398000	8400000	I gotta say
8400000	8402000	No disrespect to the tweet
8402000	8404000	Or the story or what have you
8404000	8406000	This sounds like a whole lot of nothing
8406000	8408000	Absolutely nothing
8408000	8410000	This sounds like Iwata just completely dodging this question
8410000	8412000	He didn't want to tell the guy
8412000	8414000	No we're not doing a fucking mobile phone
8414000	8416000	He just wanted to give this big answer about
8416000	8418000	Well if we did that we'd have to do this and this
8418000	8420000	But it's something we're always looking into
8420000	8422000	Just say no
8422000	8424000	So that they'll say oh it's something we may be looking into
8424000	8426000	But when it comes to actually you know
8426000	8428000	Talking about games that they're porting over
8428000	8430000	Oh that no
8430000	8432000	I had my hopes up
8432000	8434000	That this was going to be a story about like
8434000	8436000	I don't know Mario Brothers on my iPhone or something
8436000	8438000	How silly of me
8438000	8440000	How silly of me
8440000	8442000	WatchDragon tweets us saying
8442000	8444000	Going old school just beat Tyrion
8444000	8446000	Does anyone remember Tyrion?
8448000	8450000	Anyone?
8450000	8452000	It was an epic mega games shooter
8452000	8454000	From 94
8454000	8456000	And the minute I saw a screen
8456000	8458000	I admit I cheat and I googled it because I'm like what is this
8458000	8460000	And the minute I saw a screenshot I'm like
8460000	8462000	What a fucking game back when it was shareware
8462000	8464000	I guess the whole thing was released
8464000	8466000	In 2007 as uh
8466000	8468000	Or no Freeware in 04
8468000	8470000	And the graphics are open license
8470000	8472000	As of April of 07
8472000	8474000	That's kind of cool
8474000	8476000	Where can you download this game? I'll give a shout out
8476000	8478000	For the download let's see
8478000	8480000	Uhhhh
8480000	8482000	Official Tyrion repository
8482000	8484000	Freewebs.com
8484000	8486000	Slash world tree games
8486000	8488000	There you go
8488000	8490000	One more tweet last tweet
8490000	8492000	AlphaCananagram tweets us
8492000	8494000	Did y'all talk about Play for Japan coming out today?
8494000	8496000	Sorry many distractions on my end today
8496000	8498000	Actually we didn't it hasn't come up yet
8498000	8500000	So we should say
8500000	8502000	That the Play for Japan album is out today
8502000	8504000	So if you have not checked it out in iTunes
8504000	8506000	To see if it's something you want to get
8506000	8508000	And help out a good cause
8508000	8510000	You probably should do that after the show
8510000	8512000	Play for Japan is out
8512000	8514000	That does it for Twitter tonight
8514000	8516000	Twitter.com slash OLR
8516000	8518000	Future week back to gaming news
8518000	8520000	Loki
8520000	8522000	Sorry distracted by a very very strange
8522000	8524000	Picture of Katy Perry for some reason
8524000	8526000	Why is it that she has like
8526000	8528000	That
8528000	8530000	I don't understand it that doesn't make any sense
8530000	8532000	Why is she famous?
8532000	8534000	She's famous because she's willing
8534000	8536000	To wear a dress that has
8536000	8538000	Whipped cream dispensers
8538000	8540000	On her nipples that is why she is
8540000	8542000	Famous
8542000	8544000	I gotta admit she does have some good songs
8544000	8546000	I feel like she's a better song writer
8546000	8548000	She does have some good nipples
8548000	8550000	That makes sense
8550000	8552000	Nintendo is actually
8552000	8554000	In line again for another lawsuit
8554000	8556000	If it's not motion sensors
8556000	8558000	It's now gonna be 3D
8558000	8560000	So they are facing a lawsuit over
8560000	8562000	The 3DS technology mainly the
8562000	8564000	Screen
8564000	8566000	Of course a company that you probably never heard of
8566000	8568000	Before Tomata Technologies
8568000	8570000	Has a patent suit against Nintendo
8570000	8572000	Because they have the patent for technology
8572000	8574000	Relating to displaying stereoscopic images
8574000	8576000	On screen for viewing with a naked eye
8576000	8578000	I.e. without glasses
8578000	8580000	Or other devices
8580000	8582000	Filed in 2003 grinded in 2008
8582000	8584000	And of course you know
8584000	8586000	They've run up
8586000	8588000	Suits for the Wii Fit
8588000	8590000	GameCube classic controllers
8590000	8592000	Control ports etc.
8592000	8594000	The funny thing about this though is
8594000	8596000	Nintendo doesn't make those screens
8596000	8598000	Sharp does
8598000	8600000	Oops
8600000	8602000	So Nintendo licensed
8602000	8604000	The screen technology from Sharp or whatever
8604000	8606000	Contracted Sharp to put those screens in
8606000	8608000	Yeah
8608000	8610000	And some of the people
8610000	8612000	They were commenting and they were all as expected
8612000	8614000	Googled Tomata Technologies
8614000	8616000	Feels the only notable thing that they've ever done
8616000	8618000	Is sue Nintendo
8618000	8620000	Once again one of those patent
8620000	8622000	Sniping
8622000	8624000	Companies I guess
8624000	8626000	Patent trolls I feel like patent trolls need a theme
8626000	8628000	Song here on the show
8628000	8630000	We'll look into that for the future
8630000	8632000	Anyhow I am glad I waited
8632000	8634000	To buy this game because the new version
8634000	8636000	That's coming out on Playstation Network sounds kinda awesome
8636000	8638000	It's Castlevania Harmony of Despair
8638000	8640000	If you don't remember this game
8640000	8642000	It's the HD Castlevania game that was released
8642000	8644000	Almost a year ago on the Xbox 360
8644000	8646000	It's finally coming out to the
8646000	8648000	Playstation 3
8648000	8650000	But the good news is your wait may pay off
8650000	8652000	Because the PSN version of the game
8652000	8654000	It will come with a new
8654000	8656000	Local 4 player cooperative mode
8656000	8658000	Including the 6 player online mode
8658000	8660000	There's also going to be the beauty
8660000	8662000	Desire situation desire map pack
8662000	8664000	And some extra carriers
8664000	8666000	Carriers, characters that will carry
8666000	8668000	Whips and other weapons
8668000	8670000	Julius Belmont and Yoko Belonades
8670000	8672000	So kinda cool
8672000	8674000	You know I played the demo
8674000	8676000	Of this game and I was kinda like
8676000	8678000	But I have a lot of friends that are really into it
8678000	8680000	And I think I need to give it a second chance
8680000	8682000	So I will definitely check it out on PSN
8682000	8684000	So yeah very cool
8684000	8686000	Dr. Sakura
8686000	8688000	In other news
8688000	8690000	For fans of Nights like me
8690000	8692000	There is an
8692000	8694000	OC Remix album put out
8694000	8696000	It's called Lucid Dreaming
8696000	8698000	It is a free download
8698000	8700000	And it has
8700000	8702000	25 arrangements
8702000	8704000	And 2 bonus tracks
8704000	8706000	From Nights
8706000	8708000	Into Dreams
8708000	8710000	And it's actually put out as an anniversary release
8710000	8712000	Because 15 years ago
8712000	8714000	It came out on Sega Saturn
8714000	8716000	So it is available at
8716000	8718000	lucid.ocremix.org
8718000	8720000	And I am
8720000	8722000	Going to be downloading the crap out of this when I'm done
8722000	8724000	You love Nights right?
8724000	8726000	Oh yeah Nights is fun although it always made me
8726000	8728000	Motion sick
8728000	8730000	But yeah it's an overclocked remix
8730000	8732000	The whole album is overclocked so
8732000	8734000	OC Remix has been getting
8734000	8736000	More and more exposure it seems over the years
8736000	8738000	Didn't they do the remix soundtrack
8738000	8740000	For the Street Fighter 2
8740000	8742000	Remix
8742000	8744000	I think they said this is their 26th album
8744000	8746000	That they've done
8746000	8748000	Well yeah but this is
8748000	8750000	Doesn't this have some type of backing by Sega
8750000	8752000	Or no this is just a fan thing
8752000	8754000	I think this is just a fan thing
8754000	8756000	Oh my bad I thought for some reason it was like an endorsed thing
8756000	8758000	Well still really cool yeah
8758000	8760000	No they've done a few fan albums
8760000	8762000	Like the Final Fantasy 7 one
8762000	8764000	There was probably several more than one
8764000	8766000	I think there was a Mega Man one too so yeah I'm not surprised
8766000	8768000	That's cool
8768000	8770000	It's under about
8770000	8772000	And uh
8772000	8774000	No it doesn't say that
8774000	8776000	It just says the fan project so
8776000	8778000	I'll link the website in the chatroom
8778000	8780000	Alright
8780000	8782000	Loki
8782000	8784000	You know
8784000	8786000	It was a matter of time
8786000	8788000	We even hinted that this is something
8788000	8790000	That may happen and sure enough
8790000	8792000	Sony has announced
8792000	8794000	Or I shouldn't even say they've announced
8794000	8796000	It was mainly found out
8796000	8798000	That they were going to be doing this and then they acknowledged
8798000	8800000	Yeah we're doing it
8800000	8802000	There is now going to be a
8802000	8804000	PlayStation network pass on
8804000	8806000	First party games from Sony
8806000	8808000	Basically this is just like the other online
8808000	8810000	Passes Project 10 dollars
8810000	8812000	What the fuck you want to call it?
8812000	8814000	Ripping off people that are buying used
8814000	8816000	Pass
8816000	8818000	That will be included starting with
8818000	8820000	Resistance 3
8820000	8822000	Basically you have to have this network pass in order to play
8822000	8824000	Online
8824000	8826000	If you're buying it used
8826000	8828000	Since it's a one time use code
8828000	8830000	And the code has been used you have to purchase it
8830000	8832000	For an unset amount of money
8832000	8834000	But I think it's just
8834000	8836000	Could it be 10 dollars?
8836000	8838000	It could be 10 dollars
8838000	8840000	It could be 5 dollars
8840000	8842000	That's what other companies are doing
8842000	8844000	I don't like this trend at all
8844000	8846000	I don't know
8846000	8848000	It looks like you may be out of luck Loki
8848000	8850000	It looks like everybody is jumping on board
8850000	8852000	What makes this notable I'm sure in many ways
8852000	8854000	We're not talking a third party developer
8854000	8856000	We're talking fucking Sony's on board
8856000	8858000	With this
8858000	8860000	Which is interesting because Sony always made a big deal about how
8860000	8862000	PSN is free
8862000	8864000	Yeah it's free if you buy it new
8864000	8866000	But then
8866000	8868000	I don't know it's stupid
8868000	8870000	I'm sorry
8870000	8872000	It's just like if you use it
8872000	8874000	They're using the excuse
8874000	8876000	Well if you buy it used
8876000	8878000	The developer doesn't get any of that money
8878000	8880000	No they already got that money when the game was purchased
8880000	8882000	It's just new
8882000	8884000	I don't understand
8884000	8886000	But you should buy all your games new
8886000	8888000	Oh it's a stupid argument
8888000	8890000	Just like you buy all your CDs new
8890000	8892000	Just like how you buy all your clothes new
8892000	8894000	There's no such thing as a thrift store
8894000	8896000	Macy's doesn't get money
8896000	8898000	When you buy that used clothes
8898000	8900000	At a garage sale
8900000	8902000	Too bad
8902000	8904000	Then you need to make your games better
8904000	8906000	So those people think that it's worth paying
8906000	8908000	60 dollars for
8908000	8910000	To drop your prices down
8910000	8912000	To a reasonable amount
8912000	8914000	Where people feel it's necessary to buy
8914000	8916000	I'm sorry
8916000	8918000	It's just after all the
8918000	8920000	Bullshit that they've done with other things
8920000	8922000	I don't know
8922000	8924000	Why people put up with it
8924000	8926000	Let me put it this way
8926000	8928000	If you're still interested in playing this game online
8928000	8930000	And buying it new is not for you
8930000	8932000	What I recommend doing is waiting a good year
8932000	8934000	Before it drops down in price
8934000	8936000	If that's not good enough for you
8936000	8938000	It's sucker new
8938000	8940000	Or just shop around
8940000	8942000	A lot of people drop the prices of those games
8942000	8944000	At launch
8944000	8946000	That entice people to come buy there
8946000	8948000	And so you may be able to find it
8948000	8950000	Cheaper than that
8950000	8952000	Or if you're in the case of me
8952000	8954000	Which I could give a rat's ass about
8954000	8956000	Resistance
8956000	8958000	It's multiplayer
8958000	8960000	It wouldn't matter to me either way
8960000	8962000	But once again
8962000	8964000	I'm just not gonna buy it
8964000	8966000	I hope Microsoft is smart
8966000	8968000	And decides not to do this
8968000	8970000	I hope that they say
8970000	8972000	Hey you know what
8972000	8974000	We're not gonna jump on this bandwagon
8974000	8976000	Because I have a feeling
8976000	8978000	They're either gonna jump on it
8978000	8980000	Because everybody else is doing it
8980000	8982000	Or they're gonna hold strong and say
8982000	8984000	Hey you know what we don't need to do that
8984000	8986000	Because it's gonna look really bad
8986000	8988000	If they do it
8988000	8990000	Because they're charging for online
8990000	8992000	And then they're charging again
8992000	8994000	For you to get access on
8994000	8996000	Nah I don't know
8996000	8998000	That's where I'm kind of at with Dark Toa Gak
8998000	9000000	Because I'm like you know
9000000	9002000	I understand why you're pissed off at Sony
9002000	9004000	But I'm a little worried that this is just the first
9004000	9006000	Of everybody jumping on board with this
9006000	9008000	Of course I don't buy a lot of games
9008000	9010000	Used
9010000	9012000	But I kind of like having that option
9012000	9014000	Available to me
9014000	9016000	Especially when they go out of print
9016000	9018000	It's also rentals
9018000	9020000	If you're going on Gamefly or something like that
9020000	9022000	And you want to play the online portion of this
9022000	9024000	Well you're fucking out of luck
9024000	9026000	Unless you want to
9026000	9028000	Pay ten dollars or whatever
9028000	9030000	Alright
9030000	9032000	Let's move on
9032000	9034000	I want to talk to you about a Facebook game
9034000	9036000	Yes a Facebook game but this is one that's been
9036000	9038000	Making a lot of heads turned this week
9038000	9040000	Civilization World finally
9040000	9042000	Launched on Facebook
9042000	9044000	How do you like that? Remember how I bitched about how I didn't have an invite?
9044000	9046000	Well I did get one later that night
9046000	9048000	So thank you Dark Tetsuya for hooking me up with that
9048000	9050000	And not even three days later it went public
9050000	9052000	Which is fine
9052000	9054000	At least I got to have a somewhat
9054000	9056000	Early look at it
9056000	9058000	But yes Civilization World is a new Facebook game
9058000	9060000	And it's turning a lot of people's heads
9060000	9062000	Because a lot of people are going
9062000	9064000	This is a really good game
9064000	9066000	And it's a Facebook game
9066000	9068000	I got to be honest
9068000	9070000	At its core I still feel like
9070000	9072000	There's a lot of elements that make it very
9072000	9074000	Facebook-y
9074000	9076000	Like the whole, hey do you want to get more harvests
9076000	9078000	In an hour? Give us your money
9078000	9080000	Do you want to get more culture generation?
9080000	9082000	Give us your money
9082000	9084000	Do you want to get extra bonuses and other perks?
9084000	9086000	Give us your money
9086000	9088000	So there's a lot of that going on in Civ World
9088000	9090000	But otherwise there are a lot of
9090000	9092000	Kind of cool elements to it
9092000	9094000	One of the things I like about it is a Facebook
9094000	9096000	Game because I did spend, obviously I spent
9096000	9098000	Quite a bit of time with it this week
9098000	9100000	I just neglected to mention it during my gaming week
9100000	9102000	Because I was pissed off because I couldn't get in today
9102000	9104000	Because they're having a lot of server issues today
9104000	9106000	Because I think the game is just too damn popular
9106000	9108000	I think they're crushing under the weight of the popularity
9108000	9110000	Of the game
9110000	9112000	But anyhow
9112000	9114000	I was playing some of the game, but one of the things I really like about it
9114000	9116000	Is that you work with a nation
9116000	9118000	You can join a nation
9118000	9120000	To kind of better yourselves
9120000	9122000	And you're supposed to be working with these people
9122000	9124000	So that you can
9124000	9126000	Beat other nations and you can get the technologies
9126000	9128000	You need to advance yourself as a nation
9128000	9130000	But at the same time
9130000	9132000	You're kind of against these same people
9132000	9134000	Because there's also competition
9134000	9136000	Going on amongst you guys for
9136000	9138000	Who is on top of your nation
9138000	9140000	And whoever is on the top of your nation
9140000	9142000	Gets more votes and a bigger say
9142000	9144000	To drive the entire nation
9144000	9146000	So I kind of like that
9146000	9148000	Whole teamwork with a knife
9148000	9150000	To your back type of thing
9150000	9152000	There's something about that kind of gameplay
9152000	9154000	That's actually really rad
9154000	9156000	And I think that's the element that this game has
9156000	9158000	That no other Facebook game has
9158000	9160000	And why the rest of it
9160000	9162000	It really has nothing
9162000	9164000	It's not fucking civilization
9164000	9166000	I'm sorry, when I played it
9166000	9168000	It has similar music
9168000	9170000	And it has the concepts of
9170000	9172000	Trade, science, agriculture
9172000	9174000	And culture
9174000	9176000	Really growing a city
9176000	9178000	But after that
9178000	9180000	I don't know, a lot of the similarities
9180000	9182000	To civilization
9182000	9184000	Kind of end
9184000	9186000	I guess you still have the science tree
9186000	9188000	There's some really weird minigames that have nothing to do with civilization
9188000	9190000	That doesn't mean I don't like it though
9190000	9192000	I like it
9192000	9194000	If I really want to play civilization
9194000	9196000	I'm going to go back and play Civ 5
9196000	9198000	You know what I mean?
9198000	9200000	This isn't going to get me to quit playing piece of civilization
9200000	9202000	Yeah, it's like
9202000	9204000	It's a civilization Facebook game
9204000	9206000	But it's the fact that they've worked so hard on this
9206000	9208000	And that I think Sid Meier
9208000	9210000	Is actually involved
9210000	9212000	I think led to this whole other angle
9212000	9214000	That Zynga would have never come up with
9214000	9216000	I'm sorry
9216000	9218000	Is not capable of
9218000	9220000	Gaming an invention
9220000	9222000	Like this right now
9222000	9224000	Because I think they're just all about
9224000	9226000	Pushing out
9226000	9228000	Clones of what's essentially the same damn game
9228000	9230000	Between the mafia wars
9230000	9232000	And the sorority wars
9232000	9234000	And the farmvilles
9234000	9236000	And the cityvilles
9236000	9238000	And whatevervilles
9238000	9240000	So
9240000	9242000	So yeah, Civ world
9242000	9244000	The story is that yes
9244000	9246000	It launched on Facebook
9246000	9248000	So if you are waiting for an invite
9248000	9250000	Why wait? Go play
9250000	9252000	The game may be down for maintenance or something though
9252000	9254000	But yeah
9254000	9256000	In some of the reviews I'm hearing
9256000	9258000	Is that it has a lot of the just one more turn quantities
9258000	9260000	Of civilization
9260000	9262000	And yeah, that's kind of true
9262000	9264000	But there is a point where there isn't a lot to do
9264000	9266000	But hover your mouse over
9266000	9268000	Waiting for little bonus
9268000	9270000	Science outputs and things like that
9270000	9272000	But I don't know
9272000	9274000	I think it's better than most
9274000	9276000	Facebook games I've ever played
9276000	9278000	You know what's more fun than a Facebook game though?
9278000	9280000	Emails
9280000	9282000	And the emails you send to us every week
9282000	9284000	At mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
9284000	9286000	Darzagra is gonna dive
9286000	9288000	In the mailbag right now and read some emails
9288000	9290000	For us to respond to
9290000	9292000	We actually got something from
9292000	9294000	Holly
9294000	9296000	About the Commercial Felony Streaming Act
9296000	9298000	So thanks for reporting on this
9298000	9300000	I've contacted my senator and my congressman
9300000	9302000	And sent it on to my friends and family
9302000	9304000	Hopefully if everyone tells them no
9304000	9306000	We can get this nonsense blocked
9306000	9308000	Bravo, good job
9308000	9310000	That's what everybody should be doing
9310000	9312000	By the way we have a follow up coming later in the show
9312000	9314000	We'll get to it in a minute
9314000	9316000	This comes from Rubba
9316000	9318000	Rubba, who I think added me on Steam the other day
9318000	9320000	Cool
9320000	9322000	You had a really good caller last week
9322000	9324000	Who discussed the kids that were Crestfallen
9324000	9326000	About the closure of Virtual Magic Kingdom
9326000	9328000	You also discussed the Star Wars Momo closing
9328000	9330000	These things are really good lessons
9330000	9332000	To children and adults alike
9332000	9334000	They should learn 1. Everything ends
9334000	9336000	Your dog will die, the batteries won't last forever
9336000	9338000	And MMOs or businesses will stop supporting it someday
9338000	9340000	I think this is more for the younger crowd
9340000	9342000	2. Virtual goods are not goods
9342000	9344000	They will someday disappear
9344000	9346000	In an instant when the MMO closes
9346000	9348000	This is why I find
9348000	9350000	Placing cash value on gold or items
9350000	9352000	To be an utter waste of time
9352000	9354000	Adults still need to learn this lesson
9354000	9356000	3. You will not always
9356000	9358000	Get what you want
9358000	9360000	It's funny that many of today's Americans don't understand this concept
9360000	9362000	Amen
9362000	9364000	And on the bright side 4
9364000	9366000	Something new and shiny will come along
9366000	9368000	To make you forget about the old MMO
9368000	9370000	So there we have it
9370000	9372000	Dealing with loss, bubble economies, humility and optimism
9372000	9374000	Rubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba
9374000	9376000	Things will end and your dog
9376000	9378000	Will die
9378000	9380000	This is kind of a Debbie Downer email
9380000	9382000	It's true though
9382000	9384000	Your email gets a sad trombone
9384000	9386000	It's true though isn't it?
9386000	9388000	It is but
9388000	9390000	It goes back to my old rant about Americans
9390000	9392000	And this sense of self entitlement
9392000	9394000	Everyone thinks that
9394000	9396000	Everyone owes them something and they don't want to
9396000	9398000	Work for anything and you know what?
9398000	9400000	Bite my ass
9400000	9402000	Oh except that's too much effort for you to come to my house and bite my ass
9402000	9404000	Well what about, well you better be careful
9404000	9406000	Because there's some creepsters out there who might actually try to show up at your door
9406000	9408000	And say I'm here to bite your ass ma'am
9408000	9410000	I'll kick her in the balls
9410000	9412000	What if it's a girl?
9412000	9414000	I'll kick her in the clit
9414000	9416000	Alright
9416000	9418000	That hurts kind of bad
9418000	9420000	I would imagine
9420000	9422000	Anyhow wow I just didn't think you'd say that
9422000	9424000	But what about, okay what about the whole angle of
9424000	9426000	But I paid for stuff in the game
9426000	9428000	And yeah I realize the address is in the email
9428000	9430000	But I don't know like
9430000	9432000	I can see the disappointment if you've actually like put money
9432000	9434000	And time into this and then suddenly it's like
9434000	9436000	Oh I've pulled the plug
9436000	9438000	Well you know what I'll be disappointed and sad when my cat dies
9438000	9440000	I guess you've poured a lot of money into her
9440000	9442000	Visits and I've bought that bed down there
9442000	9444000	And I feed her and I take care of her
9444000	9446000	But one day she's gonna go
9446000	9448000	You know I'm very sad I love my cat
9448000	9450000	But you know
9450000	9452000	I've, my computer here
9452000	9454000	I've got all this shit on it
9454000	9456000	Grandma and grandpa gonna die
9456000	9458000	But you don't need to tell them that
9458000	9460000	Cause they already know
9460000	9462000	I don't know when
9462000	9464000	I don't know how
9464000	9470000	But one day they gonna die
9470000	9474000	But you don't need to tell them that
9474000	9476000	World of Warcraft
9476000	9478000	They know already
9478000	9480000	Yeah but I mean seriously
9480000	9482000	You know
9482000	9484000	Your Playstation's gonna break
9484000	9486000	One day
9486000	9488000	Ask Spassinator
9488000	9490000	I know yeah Spassinator should know all about that
9490000	9492000	Your Xbox is gonna
9492000	9494000	Be a bed ring
9494000	9496000	That little beta that you've got
9496000	9498000	In your pot on your desk at work
9498000	9500000	Is gonna die
9500000	9502000	Well aren't we just a fucking
9502000	9504000	One day your house will burn down
9504000	9506000	And you won't live there anymore
9506000	9508000	No but seriously everything
9508000	9510000	Has an end
9510000	9512000	Face it
9512000	9514000	Just because you liked it and it was fun
9514000	9516000	Including OLR
9516000	9518000	No
9518000	9520000	Just because you liked it and it was fun
9520000	9522000	And you get to have it forever
9522000	9524000	Grow up
9524000	9526000	Okay
9526000	9528000	Last one
9528000	9530000	And it comes from Robert Mmm
9530000	9532000	I recently picked up Atari's
9532000	9534000	Greatest Hits Volume 1 on the DS
9534000	9536000	First major points off for including
9536000	9538000	Atari Video Cube instead of Yars
9538000	9540000	Revenge. The games do
9540000	9542000	Play very well though and although the small screen
9542000	9544000	Hurts arcade games such as Gravatar
9544000	9546000	They control pretty spot on to the originals
9546000	9548000	I noticed on the back of the box
9548000	9550000	The proclamation the most popular
9550000	9552000	Casual games of all time
9552000	9554000	Interesting. Do you consider retro games
9554000	9556000	To be casual you know unless you're
9556000	9558000	Steve Weeby or something
9558000	9560000	Um
9560000	9562000	They were just different back then
9562000	9564000	Interesting. Interesting. I think a lot of retro games
9564000	9566000	Are just very simple in concept
9566000	9568000	Were they casual? I think a lot of people
9568000	9570000	Take a casual approach to it cause I know
9570000	9572000	When you have emulators
9572000	9574000	And you can sample everything at the buffet
9574000	9576000	People will play games for five seconds
9576000	9578000	I remember this. Next game
9578000	9580000	I remember this. It's like
9580000	9582000	It's like you lick the vanilla ice cream
9582000	9584000	This tastes good. You lick the chocolate ice cream
9584000	9586000	This tastes good too
9586000	9588000	But back in the day when you would drop
9588000	9590000	$50 on those games like they
9590000	9592000	Entertained you for a long time
9592000	9594000	Well and I'm gonna
9594000	9596000	I'm actually gonna use a comparison from
9596000	9598000	Design theory actually
9598000	9600000	Okay
9600000	9602000	Back then first of all
9602000	9604000	You didn't have a lot of space to actually
9604000	9606000	Game on so you had to do the most you
9606000	9608000	Could with the most simple of tools by
9608000	9610000	Today's standards right?
9610000	9612000	Also we had a longer attention
9612000	9614000	Span as people back then
9614000	9616000	I really think so because today
9616000	9618000	I mean we're bombarded
9618000	9620000	With everything and I don't know
9620000	9622000	If you've looked in a magazine from say
9622000	9624000	1970
9624000	9626000	1975
9626000	9628000	And looked like at an article
9628000	9630000	For like pantyhose
9630000	9632000	And it has this big long description
9632000	9634000	Of why you want to use legs
9634000	9636000	And all of this stuff
9636000	9638000	And they really a lot of text a lot of
9638000	9640000	Information on there and now
9640000	9642000	An ad is usually just a picture of
9642000	9644000	A face or a leg
9644000	9646000	And legs
9646000	9648000	Buy it
9648000	9650000	Or if it's like a
9650000	9652000	Catalog for Abercrombie and Fitch
9652000	9654000	It's just naked
9654000	9656000	Good looking 20 year olds
9656000	9658000	Butts but it's to sell
9658000	9660000	Clothes and they sell clothes through
9660000	9662000	Nudity
9662000	9664000	Where it's like
9664000	9666000	You pull up a 50's ad for the toasters
9666000	9668000	And it's like this makes some fucking
9668000	9670000	Amazing toast and the toast will brown
9670000	9672000	Just right and Mrs. Cleaver
9672000	9674000	Loves it and she uses this toaster every day
9674000	9676000	This toaster really gets my
9676000	9678000	Toast buttered and I love this toaster
9678000	9680000	And it's economical and it looks great
9680000	9682000	In the kitchen
9682000	9684000	In fact I actually remember recently
9684000	9686000	Seeing an article for like these
9686000	9688000	Ugly ass plaid bell bottom pants
9688000	9690000	In the 70's and it said
9690000	9692000	Like something
9692000	9694000	Stretch fiber pants for today's modern
9694000	9696000	Man these type of pants are for the
9696000	9698000	Man who wants to get up and put on his pants and
9698000	9700000	Go and it was really
9700000	9702000	Describing it you know like you were watching
9702000	9704000	A TV commercial or something
9704000	9706000	Well even television commercials now are pretty
9706000	9708000	Simple to the point you know
9708000	9710000	Because our attention
9710000	9712000	To pants are shorter we are bombarded
9712000	9714000	With so much information
9714000	9716000	And it just gets to be more
9716000	9718000	It's gonna be like our photo albums in the future
9718000	9720000	Are gonna be like from The Last Starfighter
9720000	9722000	When the dude shows the little square
9722000	9724000	And it's like 50 million pictures all at once
9724000	9726000	When dude's got here's my photo
9726000	9728000	There's them and them
9728000	9730000	Well wouldn't that just be like one of those digital picture frames
9730000	9732000	Yeah except it does
9732000	9734000	A photo a second
9734000	9736000	Actually I think it did like a photo every half
9736000	9738000	Second or something but still
9738000	9740000	The point is is that we had longer
9740000	9742000	Attention spans back then and I think a little bit
9742000	9744000	More in the way of determination we were satisfied
9744000	9746000	With less because back then
9746000	9748000	That was our big thing
9748000	9750000	And then it keeps pushing
9750000	9752000	The envelope and pushing the envelope and now we have
9752000	9754000	Such high expectations
9754000	9756000	That
9756000	9758000	Really if it
9758000	9760000	You know doesn't hit that
9760000	9762000	Factor where it's gonna something's gonna change
9762000	9764000	Every five seconds and hold your attention
9764000	9766000	That's exactly what's gonna happen you're gonna lose
9766000	9768000	Interest in it and you're gonna move on
9768000	9770000	Speaking of which let's get to the next email
9770000	9772000	There's no more emails
9772000	9774000	No more
9774000	9776000	We're out of email
9776000	9778000	And just like that the mailbag segment
9778000	9780000	Has died this week
9780000	9782000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
9782000	9784000	If you want to contribute to next week's mailbag
9784000	9806000	In the meantime let's get to some FUs of the week
9806000	9810000	I don't really have an FU actually
9810000	9814000	Ok FU to alcohol for making my face break out
9814000	9816000	Loki?
9816000	9820000	I don't have a lot of FUs because I'm coming off a high
9820000	9822000	Of a really really great weekend
9822000	9826000	But I will say I did have a really bad day this week
9826000	9828000	Where just a lot of stuff was going on
9828000	9830000	Most of it was work related
9830000	9832000	And then of course everything that I talked about on wow
9832000	9834000	Like and it's kind of funny
9834000	9836000	Like I think I took it out on this week's
9836000	9838000	Episode of Horde House because
9838000	9840000	You know a lot of my guildies that um
9840000	9842000	I've been playing with for you know a couple years now
9842000	9844000	Actually a lot of them listen to the show
9844000	9846000	And I actually was getting text messages from people going
9846000	9850000	God you are so cunty on this week's Horde House
9850000	9852000	And I'm like I was having a bad day
9852000	9855000	And I got home at 5.55 and the show had to start at 6
9855000	9857000	What do you want from me?
9857000	9859000	But otherwise things are fucking fantabulous
9859000	9861000	And I had an amazing weekend
9861000	9868000	And I it just it erased the memory of my bad day
9868000	9871000	Except for the fact that I did remember it to rant about it
9871000	9873000	But now it's done I'm done
9873000	9875000	We're not done with the news yet though
9875000	9877000	We have a few more stories for you guys
9877000	9879000	And then the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR
9879000	9881000	Or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio
9881000	9883000	We're not there quite yet
9883000	9886000	By the way I've kept Twitter open in another window
9886000	9888000	And we got another tweet that came in real quick
9888000	9893000	From Zether77 tweeted us saying
9893000	9895000	You can also get Tyrion
9895000	9897000	Cause we mentioned that game earlier on good ol' games
9897000	9899000	GOG
9899000	9901000	I was not aware but now I am
9901000	9903000	I wonder how much I'll have to check that out
9903000	9907000	Let's get to a couple more news stories for you guys
9907000	9910000	We talked about last week said that Bill 978
9910000	9916000	Where it may affect gameplay videos on YouTube and stuff like that
9916000	9920000	So if you uploaded pictures of yourself playing a game or something like that
9920000	9924000	And showing the gameplay that that may be considered copyrighted acts
9924000	9929000	And that you'd be basically slapped with a felony charge
9929000	9931000	And jail time
9931000	9934000	Apparently though the way the bill is worded now
9934000	9937000	They're saying that it's actually may not be the case
9937000	9940000	Basically the statue can only be enforced in instances
9940000	9943000	Where uploaders are willfully infringing on the copyright
9943000	9945000	With the intent to make money
9945000	9949000	And is only punishable if said uploader makes
9949000	9953000	Or the game company loses over $2500
9953000	9957000	And that's probably not gonna be the case for most walkthroughs and stuff like that
9957000	9959000	Doesn't totally change my opinion
9959000	9961000	I still think it's stupid
9961000	9965000	I think this report that you're giving us
9965000	9968000	I mean don't blame you I know you're getting it from a game blog somewhere
9968000	9970000	And what folks are reporting on the web
9970000	9972000	But it's a little bit smoke and mirrors to me
9972000	9974000	Because I don't think it detracts from the real issue
9974000	9977000	That okay well where as a lot of individuals
9977000	9979000	What about the middle man
9979000	9984000	You know review companies from businesses that are not IGN one up etc
9984000	9987000	But you know still need those hits
9987000	9991000	I mean for me this is really bad for small business
9991000	9994000	Yeah cause I mean they say oh well you know
9994000	9996000	Unless the company loses over $2500
9996000	9998000	Yeah but you know these RIA
9998000	10002000	The RIA said that oh these record companies have lost millions of dollars
10002000	10004000	From one MP3 download
10004000	10006000	So you know they can make that shit up
10006000	10008000	Off the top of their heads
10008000	10013000	So you know why not say oh yeah this YouTube video of some of the gameplay streaming
10013000	10015000	That cost us so much money
10015000	10017000	Or what if you had
10017000	10019000	How can you prove that a YouTube lost $2500
10019000	10021000	Exactly
10021000	10024000	Couldn't a game company say because you gave my game a negative review
10024000	10026000	We lost all these sales
10026000	10029000	Everybody that watched your thing was a potential sale
10029000	10032000	I mean that seems so vague and rude this is a shittily written law
10032000	10035000	Just like I said last week and yes I used that word last week and I'm using it again
10035000	10037000	Shittily
10037000	10039000	Shittily's law
10039000	10042000	Yeah it's not
10042000	10044000	Not good
10044000	10051000	Hey let's talk about origin vs steam and some of the follow ups to that
10051000	10054000	I teased this a little bit before and after this story we'll get into your calls
10054000	10059000	A forum post was posted by EA senior vice president of global e-commerce
10059000	10064000	Saying that gamers should be able to buy EA titles on any site they want including steam
10064000	10066000	But here's the thing
10066000	10070000	I guess what happened is that the crisis 2 disappearing from valve service
10070000	10072000	Was the result of a business deal
10072000	10076000	Where certain DLC for the game couldn't appear on steam
10076000	10079000	So valve removed the title completely
10079000	10082000	Basically valve is like you know because
10082000	10086000	Valve wants to facilitate all the downloads and patches within its own system
10086000	10088000	Which for us the consumer I think is really good
10088000	10090000	That's why a lot of us like steam
10090000	10093000	But EA is like no we want control of that
10093000	10095000	So now there's a power struggle going on here
10095000	10100000	Well anyhow the forum post went on to say that the origin platform is a choice for game buyers
10100000	10103000	Not an exclusive outlet for all the publishers content going forwards
10103000	10107000	EA is working to integrate more and more between the game and origin
10107000	10109000	According to the post
10109000	10112000	I'm absolutely not at this point saying hey it's origin versus steam
10112000	10114000	It's never been about that
10114000	10118000	I don't know if I totally believe that but we'll see
10118000	10123000	EA wants to continue offering our games for sale on all major download sites
10123000	10126000	However you say that on one hand and then on the other hand
10126000	10130000	Didn't they announce that star wars the old republic will only be on the new EA store
10130000	10134000	So already there is a contradiction in your post
10134000	10138000	So it makes me a little bit apprehensive to believe anything else you're saying
10138000	10145000	Anyhow EA posted some digital retailers that are going to be carrying battlefield 3
10145000	10147000	And guess who's not on it
10147000	10150000	Yeah it's totally not origin versus steam
10150000	10153000	It has nothing to do with trying to crack things up
10153000	10157000	It's because they're really trying to offer download content on their own
10157000	10160000	And steam is being so bad and not letting them do that
10160000	10164000	I don't know who to root for in this case
10164000	10168000	There is a part of me that's like well you know if EA really wants that
10168000	10170000	Why does steam need that
10170000	10174000	But I guess that's part of what steam kind of sells itself on
10174000	10176000	Is that all the patching and stuff goes through us
10176000	10180000	So if your server goes down EA and the game can't patch
10180000	10184000	We're not dealing on our promise as steam
10184000	10186000	I think that makes sense
10186000	10189000	It does but I am a little bit torn
10189000	10194000	I also see where EA says but I shouldn't have to every time we want to roll out a patch or something
10194000	10196000	Get permission from steam to do it
10196000	10201000	I don't think they need permission but I think that they need to host those files on steam
10201000	10205000	I think they're just throwing a little hissy fit because they can't make
10205000	10210000	I don't think they like the fact that steam is taking some of their money for the download content
10210000	10212000	And they want all of it
10212000	10213000	Really
10213000	10214000	I'm sorry go ahead
10214000	10215000	That's what it sounds like to me
10215000	10220000	Really interesting feedback in the chat room and check which way this is tilting so far
10220000	10226000	Let's see Zether in our chat says they aren't putting Battlefield 3 on steam because of the DLC clause as well
10226000	10228000	Not gonna buy from EA again
10228000	10230000	Act F says screw EA
10230000	10234000	Kaijuto says Valve you guys are better than EA tell EA to fuck off
10234000	10236000	And Randy says agreed fuck EA
10236000	10238000	And DDR dollar bill says fuck EA
10238000	10245000	So there's a pretty I mean looking at the fans most people seem to be on team valve
10245000	10248000	It chatters is anybody team EA?
10248000	10249000	Curious?
10249000	10254000	There's a lot of it says or by or um Rama says buy used
10254000	10258000	Or or I don't think you can buy used PC product really
10258000	10261000	Or you just go out to the store and buy it
10261000	10265000	I mean you don't need that digital copy you can just go buy it at a store
10265000	10269000	There you go or just buy a console version
10269000	10273000	Some other things on the whole origin stuff
10273000	10279000	One other thing I want to mention is about the origin is actually coming to the iPod iPhone and Android
10279000	10283000	There's a cross-platform Scrabble game coming for free to Android
10283000	10284000	Yay
10284000	10287000	So I mean that to be fair that is something that steam doesn't do
10287000	10290000	Steam doesn't deal in the iPad iOS universe right now
10290000	10296000	There's a part of me though that's like well how does that work because I thought Apple had the exclusive stuff on that
10296000	10299000	Like I thought you had to do everything through Apple
10299000	10305000	So how do you launch a new store unless it's like the origin app that has all these mini games that you can buy within it
10305000	10306000	Like that has to be what it is
10306000	10307000	Yeah
10307000	10309000	Right? Interesting
10309000	10314000	EA did demo the mobile offering the origin Apple let you see your friend list
10314000	10318000	Which I'm assuming is across the computer and the phone
10318000	10324000	The accompanying news feed and sharing what everybody is doing on origin no matter what platform that they're on
10324000	10328000	There's a new version of need for speed on iOS and it was launched from origin
10328000	10331000	And origin pushes your friend's leaderboard data into the game
10331000	10336000	And they said at EA that this was not possible before origin
10336000	10337000	Hmm
10337000	10341000	Well they can say whatever they want but I mean I think you know it's possible
10341000	10345000	Look at you know Open Faint
10345000	10352000	Yeah but Open Faint isn't really a app it's a enhancement to existing apps
10352000	10360000	Yeah but they're saying that it's no it wasn't possible to be able to share leaderboard data without EA's you know origin thing
10360000	10362000	But that's bullshit because
10362000	10364000	There's game center
10364000	10369000	There's game center and there's Open Faint and I'm sure that other people can find ways to do stuff like that
10369000	10374000	I mean whatever fine PR spin
10374000	10384000	Gamer girl in chat says only for sims but otherwise EA stands for eat ass as in EA eats ass
10384000	10388000	Rama says I liked EA better when they were known as electronic arts
10388000	10391000	I liked EA better when they were ECA
10391000	10393000	Want to go back in time a little bit
10393000	10401000	Check out some of the loading screens on my favorite Commodore 64 games like pinball construction set was an ECA game
10401000	10404000	Did anybody ever play pinball construction set?
10404000	10406000	That game was fucking rad
10406000	10407000	No
10407000	10410000	Anyhow
10410000	10415000	That's it let's take some calls 1877 game OLR our username on skype is orange lounge radio
10415000	10420000	The skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight on the show
10420000	10423000	Or something else that you think we haven't covered yet
10423000	10425000	Skypline is open
10425000	10428000	While we wait for some calls thanks to the delay Loki have any last minute stories for us
10428000	10436000	Yeah sure one of the things that came out this week was kind of cool is they had a mod for Call of Duty modern warfare
10436000	10442000	That basically turned it into a version of like battlefront so you can actually go check that out
10442000	10448000	It's a thing they're calling it star what was the actual I can't remember the hell they called it now
10448000	10457000	It's like a some Star Wars game I gotta find the damn link now
10457000	10465000	It looked neat though I mean I basically look like battlefront so whenever that actually makes its way out
10465000	10468000	But it's finally done you can actually download it for free
10468000	10470000	This is one of the hosted mods
10470000	10472000	Yay free
10472000	10474000	Exactly
10474000	10479000	I guess they're selling 8-bit glasses now they kind of look stupid if you ask me
10479000	10482000	Yeah I saw him too and I was like meh
10482000	10487000	I see that they have an app remember we were saying that that might happen or something like that but the free to be kicked
10487000	10492000	It was you know for the people they're playing free to play team fortress 2 that they get kicked
10492000	10497000	Yeah that was that and I was saying that's everything that's wrong with gaming culture but yeah
10497000	10500000	Yeah that kind of sucks
10500000	10505000	Let's see here if I can find this here ah there we go Galactic Warfare is what it was
10505000	10521000	And you can find that on the ModDB website
10521000	10530000	Let's see here yeah moddb.com just search for the Star Wars Galactic Warfare mod for Call of Duty 4
10530000	10535000	Looks pretty awesome
10535000	10538000	Let's see what other stuff we could talk about here
10538000	10543000	Again Skyplane is open 1877 game OLR username on skype is orange lounge radio we'll give it another couple minutes
10543000	10547000	Maybe nobody wants to call tonight then it's fine we've had a long show
10547000	10554000	Zether in our chat says apparently Sega may not be releasing the second Phantasy Star PSP game or Valkyria Chronicles 3 here
10554000	10560000	Yeah I was reading about that second Phantasy Star PSP game but I'm more looking forward to this whole Phantasy Star Online 2
10560000	10563000	Remember? That's still coming
10563000	10565000	I want to try it out
10565000	10566000	Me too
10566000	10570000	Zether says that's possibly due to piracy causing poor sales
10570000	10578000	Yeah but there's piracy in other countries as well as just here I think it's just because their games aren't selling well over here versus Japan
10578000	10583000	Could it also be that you know the PSP is kind of on its way out so you really have to evaluate what you're going to put on the PSP
10583000	10588000	Yeah they probably don't want to pay to localize it so it makes sense I guess
10588000	10594000	Xbox Live Indie games creators are expressing their disappointment with the low sales on the service
10594000	10605000	They say that there's not enough exposure for their games and like for example there was sequence which sold around 2000 copies
10605000	10612000	And they say that's kind of a flop and he's looking at the PC and mobile platforms for future projects
10612000	10621000	It's not financially viable to do a large scale project and not expect with any certainty to make some money on the indie marketplace
10621000	10630000	Also they said that Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World both pretty well known games on the marketplaces
10630000	10636000	Sold 50,000 and 16,000 copies each respectively making them relative hits for indie games
10636000	10642000	I think that our games could sell a lot better than they did with a better platform, more visibility
10642000	10648000	And he's testing that by releasing both of them on Steam on July 13th for $3
10648000	10651000	Hey the phone's finally lighting up let's see who's on the other line
10651000	10653000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
10653000	10654000	Legend of Zaku here
10654000	10655000	Hey buddy how you doing?
10655000	10658000	Nothing much just like relaxing
10658000	10659000	I miss New York
10659000	10668000	I miss New York for tomorrow, granted I had like a nasty weekend of just working, yes I had to show up to work on a Saturday
10668000	10673000	Working on the weekend, well life sucks I've had to work on Saturday too
10673000	10676000	Yeah I'm gonna need you to come in on Saturday
10676000	10683000	Yeah I think my boss was jokingly referring to that, he did the Bill Lumbergh voice
10683000	10687000	Oh great, well at least he had a sense of humor about it
10687000	10692000	Yeah but at least it got done yesterday and at least I'm relaxing today
10692000	10693000	Nice
10693000	10705000	So basically, yeah that whole EA Origin thing I kind of like killed any and all motivation for me to actually upgrade my PC
10705000	10712000	It's like I was betting the barn on Battlefield 3 showing up on Steam but because of this shit
10712000	10724000	I don't know it's like on one hand I have like almost 4 year old hardware but on the other I have no games that I'm looking forward to to justify it
10724000	10728000	And I'm not talking about Modern Warfare 3 because that's a non-starter
10728000	10733000	That game is like I'm not gonna jump on that hype bandwagon, I was banking on Battlefield 3
10733000	10739000	But if they pull out some bullshit copy protection stuff that's gonna turn me off
10739000	10745000	It needs to be like Steam where even though there is copy protection it doesn't feel like it
10745000	10749000	It's oblivious to the user and that's how it should be, it should be non-intrusive
10749000	10751000	Agree, agree
10751000	10756000	But we don't know how Origin's gonna play out because it used to be known as download manager
10756000	10762000	And even then they still had plenty of copy protection on the games they sold through that one
10762000	10769000	That's, you know, one reason I truly think crisis was like completely plagued with it, I wanted to buy crisis
10769000	10770000	Hold on Zaku, Zaku
10770000	10772000	You're wrong, basically stop me, I don't want that shit
10772000	10780000	Zaku, I really think that the reason people are all over Steam doesn't even have to necessarily do with its interface and all of that
10780000	10786000	I think it's honestly the crazy fucking deals they have on there, I don't think anybody would have given Steam a second look otherwise
10786000	10788000	I think it would have been about as popular as X-Fire
10788000	10796000	It can be true because they can, like, you know, these past couple of weekends they had their annual summer sale
10796000	10801000	So, I mean, yeah, sure, I took advantage of it by getting Call of Duty 4 for 10 bucks
10801000	10803000	Dude, Zaku, hold on, I want to say something
10803000	10806000	Do you remember X-Fire?
10806000	10812000	Um, I, faintly, I think I've seen him in certain episodes from time to time
10812000	10815000	Here's the thing, no, no, it's not a user, it's an actual program
10815000	10821000	And I think MTV Games bought them, thinking it was going to be the next big thing
10821000	10824000	Steam blew that program out of the fucking water
10824000	10832000	Because what they did is they took a lot of the things that X-Fire brought to the table and built a store around it that had killer deals
10832000	10837000	Okay, yeah, I think I remember, I may have dabbled with this a while ago
10837000	10844000	But you're right, it's like, yeah, Steam pretty much consolidates everything into one app
10844000	10846000	Into one, like, interface
10846000	10852000	Like, obviously the friends list and the browser just, like, overlay on top of the game in the background
10852000	10856000	My point is, Steam didn't really bring anything new to the table
10856000	10858000	It just made it, it's like Apple
10858000	10861000	Yes, it brought it to the table extremely well
10861000	10865000	Kind of like a lot of Microsoft products, like the Xbox
10865000	10872000	Well, it's more like Apple, like, taking something that already exists but marketing it well to the point where they make money
10872000	10876000	And that's what Steam did, they know how to market something like that
10876000	10878000	Something that gamers would want to go after
10878000	10884000	My point is that Origin, we don't really know what it's bringing to the table yet
10884000	10889000	Like, a lot of people, I think, are Team Steam in this, including myself
10889000	10894000	Because we don't really fully understand why EA wants full control of this
10894000	10901000	I mean, the way I see it is that, to them, Origin is something that's completely out of place to their norms
10901000	10905000	Case in point, Steam, it's something that they feel comfortable with
10905000	10910000	If you throw in Origin, it's something that hasn't been proven, it's not tried and true yet
10910000	10913000	And it's something that EA is still working on, it's still in its infancy
10913000	10917000	So it's really, it's the uncertainty that Origin brings to these guys
10917000	10921000	To these people that are very, you know, that are hesitant about it
10921000	10924000	And that's what's causing the rift and backlash
10924000	10926000	You know, in my honest opinion
10926000	10932000	It's like, I know Battlefield 3 will be an awesome game, but the way that the distribution is like
10932000	10936000	That plays an integral role in the fact that it can make or break their sales
10936000	10943000	You don't want somebody downloading a lemon, which is gonna be useless if it's locked down pretty tight
10943000	10946000	You know, to the point where only pirates will have the best experience
10946000	10952000	Well, I agree, the thing about Origin is that the first copy protection or whatever type of mistake they make will kill them
10952000	10960000	And this is the interesting thing about new technologies, is that the first mistake, if they make it early on, will murder them
10960000	10962000	Case in point, Google Buzz
10962000	10966000	Google Buzz was murdered by what they did with the privacy thing
10966000	10972000	If they screw up to the point where it makes Steam look, you know, really
10972000	10976000	It reaffirms that Steam is the only choice, then that's it
10976000	10983000	Then EA basically has like a walking dead man right there in Origin
10983000	10991000	The way that Origin can not only be on par if not maybe outdo Steam
10991000	10996000	Is try to bring something that hasn't been, you know, first of all they have to
10996000	11005000	One, make sure that the copy protection is not oblivious and more importantly, not obstructive to the user
11005000	11012000	The second point is they have to do something unique that differentiates themselves from Steam
11012000	11018000	Aside from what Steam has already done, I'm pretty certain that they're gonna have all the social aspects
11018000	11021000	It needs to show me what is worth leaving Steam for
11021000	11028000	And if they can't produce killer fucking deals that convince me to drop $40 on a bunch of games I'll probably end up only playing once
11028000	11030000	Then I'm not so sure they're gonna come out ahead
11030000	11036000	They need to have a contingency plan if Origin for some reason fails
11036000	11040000	Then they're right back where they were a year ago
11040000	11042000	They'll be fine
11042000	11046000	I understand, I understand, I'm not talking about right now but more long term
11046000	11049000	They need to have some sort of contingency plan in place
11049000	11056000	I'm pretty certain Valve has something in place if, should Steam ever fail and they would have to like, you know, wind down
11056000	11063000	Because they're gonna see a lot of piss off people where their digital content is not worth jack and they can't hold on to it
11063000	11069000	Remember, the content is only as good as the service that's keeping it, that's backing it up
11069000	11072000	That allows you, that enables you to actually play it
11072000	11078000	Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go but before I let you go, I am getting a request from chat
11078000	11081000	No
11081000	11088000	I can counter that with the...
11088000	11091000	Alright, Zaku, thanks for your call
11091000	11093000	Alright
11093000	11096000	Nyan
11096000	11102000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
11102000	11107000	What do you think about EA vs. Steam and all this stuff? Let us know
11107000	11113000	Meanwhile, do we have more last minute stories or did you burn them all?
11113000	11116000	I burned them all
11116000	11117000	Good job, Loki
11117000	11118000	They burned on a fire
11118000	11119000	Good job
11119000	11124000	Alright, so what's this, are we ready to announce what you're working on over there or do you need more time?
11124000	11130000	Because it did come to my attention that, you know, OLR does try to be on the cutting edge of like a bunch of social eds
11130000	11134000	But there was one that we've all been using that we're not using at OLR yet
11134000	11138000	I'll go ahead and tell everybody but I'm still working on the theme
11138000	11141000	We have a Tumblr now, there will be stuff on it
11141000	11143000	We're hipster
11143000	11145000	We'll post it with lots of pictures from Reddit
11145000	11150000	Tumblr is a really easy way to like cross post stuff and a lot of people, it's like it's...
11150000	11151000	It's the ultimate photo blog
11151000	11157000	It's MAME central, like when somebody sees something funny, they just posted their Tumblr, no words, no...
11157000	11161000	Well, you can post words like quotes and things, just pictures and stuff
11161000	11163000	And videos, but you can actually use it as a regular blog
11163000	11165000	Yeah, some people will want to follow that
11165000	11166000	We'll see what happens
11166000	11167000	Alright, let's go to the phone and take another call
11167000	11169000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
11169000	11170000	Hey, hey, it's Ronma
11170000	11171000	Hi, what's up buddy?
11171000	11174000	Not much, well, I have some interesting news to tell
11174000	11175000	Oh boy
11175000	11177000	Oh no, you'll like it
11177000	11178000	Okay
11178000	11181000	I am getting a Playstation 3
11181000	11184000	Yes! Why are you getting a Playstation 3?
11184000	11189000	Because a friend of mine is selling his first gen for 130 bucks
11189000	11190000	That's a good price
11190000	11192000	That is a good deal, especially because it's first gen
11192000	11195000	Wow! That's a low price
11195000	11200000	Yes, do you really think Sony's gonna pull $325 out of my broke ass?
11200000	11201000	I don't think so
11201000	11204000	Yeah, I gotta say, I would buy that too
11204000	11207000	First gens are better anyways because they have full backwards compatibility
11207000	11211000	I use mine to the fullest by not playing any Playstation 2 games
11211000	11213000	God, I wish...
11213000	11215000	You know, I know there's some people that would look at me and go
11215000	11218000	Why don't you just get a PS2 if you wanna play PS2 games?
11218000	11221000	But I can't tell you, having owned all the fucking consoles I do
11221000	11226000	I can't tell you how fucking convenient it is to have multiple in one box
11226000	11232000	Like, I really wish I lived in a world where the Wii, the 360 and the Playstation 3 were just one fucking console
11232000	11236000	Like, why can't I have this in life?
11238000	11239000	So
11239000	11244000	But you know what the funny thing is? You know what the reason why I'm really getting a PS3?
11244000	11253000	Because Joe Dave told me that they released the Goonies 25th anniversary edition on Blu-ray only
11253000	11256000	At that point I was like, yeah, I gotta get a PS3 now
11256000	11257000	That is pretty awesome
11257000	11259000	My husband says that's inaccurate
11259000	11261000	Oh, it is, it's inaccurate
11261000	11262000	Wait, what?
11262000	11265000	Dan? Dan!
11265000	11266000	Explanation!
11266000	11268000	Oh, he says it's coming to DVD too
11268000	11271000	It's also on DVD
11271000	11276000	Well, the fact that I heard that first, I'm like, well, for me that's not a reason to get a PS3
11276000	11280000	I don't know what it is since most of my games are on the 360
11280000	11281000	My question is this
11281000	11283000	Demon's Souls and LittleBigPlanet
11283000	11284000	Oh my god, LittleBigPlanet
11284000	11287000	Yes, Dan is correct, I just double checked on Amazon
11287000	11289000	Both are available
11289000	11291000	You were lied to
11291000	11293000	By a lying liar
11293000	11295000	I'll pistol whip her later
11295000	11297000	Alright
11297000	11298000	With love
11298000	11301000	Alright, any other thoughts, Raman, before I let you go?
11301000	11305000	I want to know what game should I get for my PS3
11305000	11307000	I want to pick from all three of you
11307000	11310000	You absolutely need LittleBigPlanet
11310000	11312000	Absolutely the must-have game on PlayStation 3
11312000	11314000	Dark Soccer?
11314000	11318000	Dance is infamous
11318000	11319000	Loki?
11319000	11321000	I would do Resistance
11321000	11324000	You can probably pick up, they have the Resistance dual pack now
11324000	11328000	With one and two in there, just pick that up and it's a good time
11328000	11329000	There you go
11329000	11330000	Works for me
11330000	11333000	Alright, well have fun with your PS3 and add me, kay?
11333000	11334000	I will, dude
11334000	11335000	Alright
11335000	11336000	Alright
11336000	11337000	Bye
11337000	11340000	1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio
11340000	11344000	I guess we can fit in one more call, one quick little call
11344000	11348000	See, it does suck because I do have to still pick up Infamous, or not Infamous, Resistance
11348000	11354000	I actually have Infamous now, I have the download mark for my PS3 from me, welcome back
11354000	11355000	And I have number two
11355000	11360000	Although I'm probably going to sell number two because I don't know if I'll really get into the series
11360000	11363000	Randy in our chatroom says, quick, back out of the purchase, Raman
11363000	11367000	Yeah, back out so I can buy it
11367000	11371000	Although that would be a waste of money because I really do have a PS2 already and all that good stuff
11371000	11373000	Alright, I guess we have time for one more call, let's take this
11373000	11375000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
11375000	11377000	Hi, this is Spaznator
11377000	11379000	Hey Spaznator, what's up buddy?
11379000	11387000	Well, two things, just in reference to the last call that you just had
11387000	11400000	If I were to recommend any games for the PS3, aside from a little bit playing what you already mentioned
11400000	11410000	I would probably go with the Resistance games, those are pretty good
11410000	11414000	I want to say this though real fast, Rama if you have the money just do LittleBigPlanet 2
11414000	11418000	Because all the old LittleBigPlanet levels you can play in LittleBigPlanet 2
11418000	11422000	Meaning the created levels online, just so you know
11422000	11431000	I hate to say it because you guys know I've been a really big supporter of PlayStation 3 and all that
11431000	11438000	I know, and you're that abused significant other that keeps coming back
11438000	11444000	I'm practically Sony's red-headed stepchild right now
11444000	11453000	Since March of last year I have had three PlayStation 3's get the yellow lighted up
11453000	11461000	Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that I got so much money invested in the system
11461000	11465000	In terms of downloadable games and of course the videos
11465000	11473000	I've got to ask this though Spaznator, is there anything you think there might be about how you use your PlayStation 3
11473000	11478000	I have to ask it, that could be contributing, like do you leave it in a poorly ventilated place
11478000	11484000	Do you use the thing so much that it just can't handle it, is it on all day
11484000	11487000	I don't know, I'm trying to think, just what could be your luck
11487000	11493000	The only thing I could come up with that could possibly factor into it
11493000	11503000	Is that my entire building as a whole is practically hotter than a hemorrhoid on Satan's ass during the summertime
11503000	11509000	I mean, you know, at least in terms of my particular place
11509000	11519000	I store my system, normally try to keep it ventilated at least 10 inches on each side
11519000	11526000	For ventilation and all that, but during the summertime the building just gets hot
11526000	11530000	But that can't totally factor into it
11530000	11538000	Because my system got the yellow lighted up twice last spring
11538000	11543000	And my building doesn't even get hot during the spring
11543000	11546000	In fact it's practically freezing cold during the spring
11546000	11550000	Let me ask this, because this is the question that the chatters are dying to know the answer to
11550000	11558000	Are you breaking up with Sony, is this it, are you saying Sony, I want to see someone else and her name is Microsoft
11558000	11566000	I'm severely tempted to, the only reason I'm intentionally having my system fixed
11566000	11569000	Is what I was starting to see a minute ago
11569000	11576000	Is that I have so much money invested in downloadable games, the DLC and the videos
11576000	11580000	I just hate to see myself lose access to that
11580000	11586000	Stuff that I already bought or got for free up until now
11586000	11591000	At least for a tiny baby until if I do get it fixed
11591000	11600000	I've been playing my 360 lot along with WoW since I just started WoW like a week or two ago
11600000	11606000	But it just killed me that the system just died plus
11606000	11612000	Now what little money I have coming soon was already earmarked for something else
11612000	11617000	And now I have to scrounge up money to get my system fixed
11617000	11624000	And rearrange my plans and stuff like that, so it's a pain in the watch
11624000	11629000	Well, keep us posted on what happens in this ongoing saga
11629000	11634000	And good luck, maybe see if Rama will sell you that PS3
11634000	11638000	I don't know, alright Spaznator, I gotta let you go to wrap up the show, but take care buddy
11638000	11640000	Alright, have a good one
11640000	11641000	Alright, bye bye
11641000	11647000	Man, we had the sad trombone email and now we have the sad trombone phone call
11647000	11650000	Three Playstation 3s get the yellow light of death
11650000	11652000	Some guys have all the luck
11652000	11658000	And yet he didn't say I'm breaking up with Sony, he said you know I just
11658000	11663000	I've spent so much on Sony over the years, I still love Sony
11663000	11666000	Alright, this is the part of the show where we wrap it all up
11666000	11668000	Thank you guys for calling in tonight, we appreciate it

11690000	11692000	All we ask, please help us spread the word
11692000	11695000	Tell a couple people you know about the show
11695000	11698000	We really would appreciate it, you know
11698000	11700000	Word of mouth is all we have
11700000	11703000	We don't even get $2500 from this show
11703000	11707000	So even though that law wouldn't apply to us, it's still stupid
11707000	11711000	So just help us spread the word, that's all we ask
11711000	11714000	And we'll try to keep entertaining you
11714000	11719000	For all the way through 10 years, come next June
11719000	11721000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight

11723000	11725000	We have many themes
11725000	11727000	My final thought is
11727000	11730000	Long Show means no Pinkberry, frown
11730000	11732000	Loki
11732000	11736000	I have a headache and I really need to remember to bring Dan Wangan Midnight for the PS3
