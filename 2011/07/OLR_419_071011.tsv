16278	19221	Is the PlayStation 4 really set to start production soon?
19541	23606	The PSP says goodbye to comics and Nintendo faces a lawsuit over
32045	33826	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers I want cake
55134	55674	DarkSakura.com
76842	91305	and so we had a joint cake that's one of our friends bought and there's one of those snarky you know friends that's you know funny bitchy funny and but got a cake that said happy birthday princesses with the two Mickey and Minnie Mouse on it so but it was cute and I ate some of the sand part
91505	94866	And I was just very happy because we just didn't want chocolate.
94986	99307	Because you might remember on OLR a few weeks ago, I got a chocolate cake, which was great.
99707	100107	I loved it.
100127	100607	Don't get me wrong.
101067	104328	Then I went to work and I had a chocolate cake at work from coworkers.
104368	105828	And I'm like, oh, yay, more chocolate.
105848	107669	But I bet Becky's cake was better.
107929	112530	Becky's cake was better because you could tell the difference between homemade and store-bought.
112930	115631	So, I mean, I appreciated the cake at work.
115651	116371	Don't get me wrong.
116831	117031	But...
117851	123513	I think the Becky cake was a little more from the heart, if you will, rather than from the grocery store.
124474	135178	Anyhow, let's go over to the third co-host on our show, here with us as he's been every single week since episode one, with few minor exceptions like when kids are born.
135998	136378	Loki!
136978	137199	Hi.
137759	138939	Hi, how are you tonight, Loki?
139019	140160	I'm a little sick, but I'm alright.
140180	140700	You're sick?
141000	143321	You better not get me sick, I'm gonna kick your butt.
143621	147042	Hey, I've been doing everything possible not to get anybody else sick.
147062	150043	I've been washing my hands like crazy and that's pretty much it.
150063	150543	That's okay.
150583	152884	I've got a bucket of Lysol I could dump on him.
153324	155425	You might need to do that because I really can't get sick.
155585	157646	Speaking of work, I have a lot going on at work.
157706	158386	It's not bad.
158446	159506	It's just congestion.
159546	160106	That's it.
160346	163688	It's not like I'm throwing up or something.
163748	167409	It's just like it could very well be allergies, but it's not.
168089	168890	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
181977	183118	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
204276	205097	I didn't go that far.
205177	206698	Come on, I'm not Arnold Schwarzenegger.
207118	207378	All right.
208159	218586	Anyhow, let's talk about video games as we get into another week here at OLR, where we talk about the gaming news, invite you guys to call us, and of course, join us in chat at chat.orangelandre.com.
218626	219366	Speaking of the chat.
219527	219827	What's that?
220367	223329	I have to ask Azure Edge, who said, I love bronies.
225451	227012	Is that like brownies for bros?
227952	230513	Is that the My Little Brony thing that we were talking about a couple weeks ago?
230593	230933	Maybe.
231093	234455	I think there's a phantom W in that.
234755	237996	Unless bronies are actually like... That would be brownies.
238296	240337	Brownies with like bacon inside of them.
240417	242298	Like, you know, brownies with bacon.
242318	243899	Those would be bronies.
243999	247300	A couple of my friends, they're actually sisters, they make bacon brownies.
247731	253536	You know, we are very much considering a pork party for Josh's first birthday.
254217	254938	I'm serious.
256059	257840	It's looking like it's probably going to happen.
257881	259342	DarkSakura, you could protest.
259542	261664	You could stand outside with your PETA sign.
263025	291390	fuck PETA no no no no here's some other fun random things real quick one of the other runner up ideas for a party and we're probably thinking about this for maybe second or third year and you're gonna laugh pedo bear themed why would you do that for your child it's funny because our friends would know what it is but our family doesn't know what pedo bear is it's just a teddy bear it would be hilarious
292389	294229	Are you going to get a bounce house and everything?
294969	295410	Maybe.
296330	301231	You should get the Pikachu bounce house where you climb into Pikachu's butt to get inside.
301671	303931	I think DarkSakura should dress up as Pito Bear.
306552	312913	I said internet meme theme party because we were trying to think of something that's not been done before.
312953	315913	Pork party, I think, is pretty... You should do a troll party and make everyone wear troll masks.
315953	319014	I was going to say, if you do an internet meme party, I will come as Nyan Cat.
320043	322185	I will have little rainbow streamers behind me.
322705	323686	I'll wear a Pop-Tart.
325647	327749	I mean, I think that would be funny, but maybe not this year.
327849	345082	This year, and the only reason she was thinking of doing Pork Party, because she mentioned it, I guess, some of her Facebook, like, mommy friends or whatever, one of them makes cakes, and they said, oh, I could make a pig cake with an apple in its mouth, and the apple would be its own personal little cake for Josh.
345262	345382	Yeah.
346443	347544	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
364861	366162	For all those pickled pig's feet.
366362	373664	You know, and it's kind of sick because we used to go there for, you know, like Easter and Christmas and all the holidays when I was younger.
374024	377825	And man, we would just have a feast of like bacon and like all that stuff.
378246	381307	And it didn't really hit me until like much later in life.
381387	382647	Like, oh God.
383347	383808	It was kind of...
385268	388192	I'm going to take some bacon outside for the pigs.
388212	390575	We used to go out to the barn and look at the baby pigs.
390615	391916	It was like, oh, it's cute, the baby pigs.
391956	393498	And we'd come in and just feast on ham.
394019	397703	And now I'm realizing, God, that was kind of messed up.
398084	402790	Okay, even when I did eat pork, ham has always been so disgusting to me.
404091	406532	It just tastes, like, not right.
406612	412475	Okay, I promise we'll get into video games here in a minute, but I have to say, about, like, ham, I gotta say, I am a ham person.
412495	413376	I like the honey-baked hams.
413396	414056	Those are my favorite.
414476	418598	But for Thanksgiving, I really don't like turkey.
419039	422040	I am not a turkey person, so... See, I'd always get my own drumstick.
422220	425702	My mother's very kind in that she always makes a ham for Thanksgiving.
425722	428163	Which is funny, because I have two brothers, and we would always fight over them.
428944	430644	So I'd just say, fine, neither of you can have them.
432025	433366	I'd wrap one up and put it in the fridge.
435185	436545	All right, video games.
436625	443087	Quickly, before we get into gaming weeks, I want to do a quick follow-up to a story from last week because it's not on the show roll anywhere.
443167	455849	And I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf, who, of course, as he has been for many, many, many, many weeks, is on before us as we do tape live every Sunday night at allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby's show.
456149	460010	And one of the things he was talking about on his 300th episode—grats on the ding, by the way—
460390	461431	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
485501	490665	which leads me to believe that you hit the nail on the head last week, Loki, when Reggie's going to come out.
490705	491766	It may not be next E3.
491786	493668	It could be the holiday or the spring.
493768	494228	It'll be next E3.
494528	495669	You think all the way to next E3?
495729	506798	I think it's next E3 because localization doesn't take that long and because they want to have something saying, hey, we haven't forgotten about you, because the whole point is they're going to try to...
507919	510541	Let the hardcore gamers know we haven't forgotten about you.
510821	512402	That's why you need to buy our new system.
513683	517826	So, I mean, granted, those are Wii games, but they still play on the new Wii U system.
518286	519807	But that's kind of the whole theme.
519847	522629	It's like they're going to be trying... Because they need that hardcore crowd.
522649	525351	Because the casual gamer doesn't give a shit about their new system.
525871	529093	I mean, eventually they will because of the touchscreen thing, but...
530254	538839	It's going to be convincing these people that really bought the system for Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort and maybe Mario Kart or something like that why they need to go out and buy another system.
539249	543511	Well, I mean, Nintendo doesn't just have to have one press conference a year, though.
543571	554917	I don't see anything stopping Nintendo from... Thinking again what you said last week about they'll come out and say, except you said it a lot more angry, the fans demanded it, and here it is.
555357	565282	There's no reason they couldn't do this big thing at Nintendo World in New York City where they'll have a big press conference and invite people to play the games in for the first time because it's what you the game...
565282	569830	Gamer Wanted, and we listen because we're the company that loves our fans.
573064	574265	I mean, I don't know.
574585	584489	They could have easily phrased it away without... Because what's the point in saying, you know, why even say no, it's not something that we're working on right now?
584569	588151	Here's an important point from Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at chat.orangeonstrady.com.
588511	591152	C goes back to when they said, not at this time.
591672	600576	Is it possible that the intern that updates Facebook perhaps just, you know, had to say something, but realized they couldn't exactly spoil an upcoming press conference?
600851	606796	No, they don't have to say anything, and if it is E3, why do they even have to say anything?
606836	607997	I mean, let's put it this way.
608437	612620	They went out during E3 and said, hey, we're going to work on a Smash Bros.
612640	612800	game.
613020	615342	I mean, we haven't started working on a Smash Bros.
615382	618224	game yet, but we will eventually work on it.
618264	624029	I mean, if they're going to announce stuff that we will eventually work on versus something that they're maybe...
624409	625309	Thanks for watching!
642876	645357	without looking like complete assholes at the same time.
645537	650959	But no, they decided, hey, we're just going to say, no, we don't have any plans to do that, and everyone gets pissed off at them.
651039	654900	I kind of think the intern just did what they had to do.
655300	656380	Well, then they should come out.
656900	659121	They have an opportunity to update at any time.
659461	660622	Hey, you know what?
660942	662722	Word is, actually, we are going to be bringing these over.
662742	662882	Let's...
665743	666864	Stay tuned for more details.
680652	683294	but are they doing any sort of press conference at PAX?
683894	696344	PAX doesn't usually have press conferences but PAX they will probably have a presence on the show floor usually the Washington because PAX is up in Seattle PAX Prime anyway and they're right in the backyard of Microsoft and Nintendo so there's no reason
697004	698785	I remember the one year we all went to PAX.
698845	703207	I believe that had been the first time that Animal Crossing was shown out on the floor.
703247	705028	I don't think it had made E3 that year.
705588	712031	My memory is a little bit fuzzy, but I seem to remember there was something on the floor that year that actually was new for Nintendo that they had not shown at E3.
712492	722997	And PAX being the whole fan service expo and delivering what the fans want and doing a mighty good job at it would actually seem like the perfect idea.
723017	725558	I think that's a great idea from Bobby.
726765	741657	The only thing that I think might be a little bit maybe not is that it's a little soon, but it could also kind of add up to this bigger equation that maybe Nintendo wanted to make E3 all about these games and then they want to make packs about the other stuff.
741677	752986	It sounds like packs would make more sense because if they're localizing this stuff for Europe already, localizing it for the United States, North America, they've already done all the voice and translation work.
753766	754947	I don't think that they really need to do anything.
754967	757369	I think all they have to worry about is the NTSC versus PAL.
757950	759511	That's the stuff they have to worry about.
759531	760372	Not just rendering.
760412	762714	High def, it doesn't matter anyway.
762995	765117	Or 480p.
765297	766798	It's the Wii.
766878	767479	It doesn't matter.
767539	769000	Let me put it this way.
769460	771863	Your Wii will interpret it any way.
772203	772763	It doesn't matter.
773885	774245	I don't know.
775326	777568	I just think that they could have done it in a more...
778697	780358	and DarkSakura.com.
804959	825612	and the interns know that update Facebook I better stick to the schedule you know I can't or they may not even know themselves but as we as we're going to get in the more information that's not true we know that's not true they've come out and said that that's not true because of certain factors that play into certain things and you can't just stick to a strict schedule anyways because you don't know what's going to happen
826112	827213	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
854941	857642	It was a little more eventful.
858062	861724	I played that game that you sent me, Terrarium.
861764	862584	Terraria, I think.
863124	864025	Terraria.
865825	869507	It's pretty fun so far, but it's still horizontal Minecraft.
871247	876129	I dug a lot of holes and died a lot and popped slimes with pickaxe.
876749	877410	I played some WoW.
878910	881851	One item level away.
882732	883452	Stupid Firelands.
885121	888063	What else did I do?
888083	892226	I played Portal 2 some more today and I played Droplets the other night.
893727	896249	What do you do in Portal 2 on all your replays?
896289	900212	Are you going for achievements or are you just trying to get your speed better?
900972	904855	I've done all of the single player achievements except for one of the speed levels.
905376	907217	But mostly I just go through because it's fun.
907837	908538	I just keep playing it.
908878	910139	I like watching your favorite movie.
910512	915133	Yeah, I played some Doom 2.
917253	918194	That's kind of random.
919294	922015	Yeah, it's not as good as I remember, but it's still fun.
922135	928056	I still remember a lot of my cheats, like, what is it, IDDQD, IDBFG, IDKF.
928156	928716	IDGAF.
930496	932897	IDKFA, you know.
934251	956752	I just remember in Doom when you could make the screen like you could adjust the screen size to get your computer to render it better for older systems and on my like really old it was either my 386 or my 486 100 I don't even remember it so long ago I had to put the window at like the minimum size to get it to run decently it was this little tiny window on my screen it's like trying to play a game boy on my computer screen
957588	958248	NRA was all weaponed.
987069	988850	Are you picking up these games through Steam sale?
988910	989090	Yeah.
989311	989611	Oh, okay.
989911	993193	Well, I already had Hexen, but I picked up the Doom Pack.
993633	994693	I'm so mad I missed that.
994713	995614	The Doom Pack was $8.
995774	999136	I missed the Quake Pack when it was on sale for like $7.
999596	1005038	And I mean, yeah, it's probably still a good deal at $20, but there's just something about the whole you're getting it at a really good deal.
1005379	1007240	Steam sales are so dangerous, I'm telling you.
1007300	1008900	When we get to My Gaming Week, it's the same story.
1008920	1011542	I wish they'd put out all the Sim stuff cheap.
1012782	1013463	Just wait, Rob.
1013503	1015844	I'm sure it'll go on sale again once Rage comes out.
1016284	1016685	Oh, it will.
1016905	1017225	I'm sure.
1017325	1019227	Yeah, I'll wait for this.
1019247	1023632	I have plenty to hold me over until, for months, for months.
1024113	1025754	Anyhow, DarkSakura, anything else?
1025774	1031781	Well, I tried to play DAC again, the Star Trek DAC, and I always keep forgetting that I need a controller to play it.
1032622	1035725	So I'm like, I'll just grab one of the Xbox controllers one day.
1036752	1037072	There you go.
1037092	1037312	I'm done.
1059133	1059914	Thank you for watching!
1076806	1078448	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1094686	1099551	Out of 200,000 plus players, being 85 is not bad.
1100912	1104635	I'm just still working on getting up there.
1105096	1109820	I was at one point trying to beat this player named Chuck Norris just because it'd be funny.
1110140	1111541	You have to defeat Chuck Norris.
1112662	1113463	But now he's gone.
1114724	1116746	Chevy Chase, I'm after you.
1120441	1121481	A little bit of Earth Defense Force.
1122682	1124842	And that was pretty much it this week.
1125122	1125983	Really didn't play a whole lot.
1127483	1127803	All right.
1129584	1130304	My gaming week.
1130544	1131004	Let's see.
1132724	1136645	I found that Steam sale to be very dangerous, that whole thing that they're doing this week.
1136726	1142507	And I have easily dropped $40 to $50 on games, which is exactly what they want people to do.
1142567	1143627	That's the whole trick behind it.
1143807	1145488	Man, I've got to say, I've picked up a lot of good stuff.
1146768	1148108	So here's some of the stuff I've played this week.
1149089	1157430	One of my favorites, and it's one of those things where I've known about this game for the longest time, and I hear good things about it, and I just, for whatever reason, have never played it.
1157490	1162771	I'm just too busy playing WoW or something on the Xbox or what have you, and I always neglect to look at this game.
1162791	1168152	But I finally picked up Beat Hazard, which is a game that's available on Steam, and it's on sale.
1168272	1173153	There's this whole combo pack going on right now where it's Beat Hazard, Ultra, and all this other stuff.
1173633	1196542	um basically in a nutshell imagine if like Geometry Wars kind of met a game where you could put your own music in and then add super seizure robots to the whole thing that's what beat hazard is is it's I I look I usually am not the photo sensitive type and and uh you know I don't usually have reactions to video games but I gotta say in playing beat hazard um
1197342	1200264	I seriously think I felt a little odd playing it.
1200344	1204606	I was like, you know, I'm not usually prone to this type of stuff, but this game is going to do it.
1204646	1208748	If any game is going to set me off and cause me to have a seizure, it's probably going to be this game.
1210829	1213211	If you haven't played the game, you're this little ship.
1213231	1220735	And the way it controls is kind of interesting on the computer because you use your mouse to target things and use the button to shoot on your mouse.
1220995	1223136	But you use WASD to move your ship.
1223456	1224016	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1248892	1272118	and the the ships kind of I guess are generated based on the music but the speed is kind of driven by the music and most importantly kind of the pulse of the bullets and the background and everything is driven by the beats of the game and a lot of your power-ups are based around volume you can the the basically the more powerful you are the louder the song gets which is kind of cool
1272518	1277521	So yeah, I think I paid about $6 for the whole thing.
1277702	1280784	It was a pretty good deal, so very happy with that.
1283205	1284866	Some of the other games I've bought during this sale.
1285727	1286627	Archon.
1287248	1302138	I had no idea that the classic 80s Commodore 64 slash NES game Archon was now on PC until I believe it was Travis from Under Sedation Live.
1302838	1303319	and DarkSakura.com.
1325572	1326373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1346291	1352414	Go to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Kaijudo says, Beat Hazard will blow your eye sockets.
1352635	1354496	I played the demo and it almost killed me.
1354936	1360859	Now, to be fair, you can turn down the intensity of the effects, but who wants to do that?
1362400	1363541	I will say this as well.
1364201	1365602	One thing I love about Beat Hazard...
1368108	1377007	For what is a pretty simple concept, they've poured a lot of replayability factors into the game in the way of power-ups and achievements.
1378690	1386114	The more you level through and the more songs you play, you get power-ups that you can permanently buy for your ship.
1386515	1390197	And then you can pick five of the power-ups for your ship for a song.
1390617	1395940	And a lot of times what the power-ups do is they do things to your ship to increase either survivability or score.
1396440	1405205	So if you're the type that wants to go for the highest score possible amongst your friends, you use the enhancements that you unlock the more you play to get that.
1405625	1413088	I just think that's kind of a neat way to do it and what kind of really enhances the playability of what's otherwise a very simple game.
1414589	1419991	I was gifted Plants vs. Zombies by our listener xlink who was on Horde House a couple weeks ago.
1420391	1426094	It's kind of like a late birthday present and finally I know DarkSakura is a huge fan of Plants vs. Zombies.
1426114	1426614	Yes I am.
1426714	1427775	And I've played the game before.
1427795	1432757	I've played the free one online but now I have the PC version and I was playing that for a little bit and
1433417	1435299	Perfecting my strategy against zombies.
1435359	1442245	I didn't realize there was a whole little mode where you could create your own zombie, and then that zombie will show up in the final wave as you play the game.
1442265	1443126	I thought that was kind of cool.
1443146	1445368	I think if you do more than one, both of them can show up.
1445728	1446048	Oh, really?
1446509	1447229	I only did the one.
1447770	1450332	I thought the point of it at first was just to make a little...
1452754	1477001	Avatar that you could use on instant messenger or on web forums and stuff which is actually a really smart idea to try and get the game exposed and I'm surprised more people haven't kind of hopped on that train where like let people make a custom avatar from your game which okay now I'm sounding kind of stupid because that's what the Xbox 360 avatar stuff is all about but I guess this is the first time I've kind of seen it in a PC fashion and kind of let them spread the word about the game.
1477261	1477501	I don't know.
1477521	1477901	Something like that.
1500109	1501110	So I've bought some games.
1501130	1503732	See, here's the other dangerous thing about the Steam sale.
1503892	1506534	I have bought games I haven't even freaking played yet.
1507035	1515221	And one of the games I bought was Amnesia, which is supposed to be just like a horrifically scary game.
1515301	1517363	Like, I was even scared by the trailer.
1517763	1522547	Like, it's seriously like a scare the pants off of you game, don't play this in the dark type of thing.
1522967	1524789	So I'm excited to check out Amnesia.
1525069	1526309	Do you know much about this game, DarkSakura?
1526329	1527509	Because you like the survival horror stuff.
1527829	1529950	Go look at the trailer on there for Amnesia.
1530370	1532390	You have to tell me if you think it's scary or not.
1532910	1533610	So, all right.
1535251	1536471	That's all I'll say about my gaming week.
1536491	1537571	Otherwise, it's been the other stuff.
1537611	1538691	Final Fantasy XIII.
1540292	1544592	I think I'm up to like 30 hours, 35 hours spent in the game.
1545372	1546873	I think I'm getting closer to the end.
1546913	1550473	I'm still in Chapter 11 because I've been doing a crap ton of side quests.
1550973	1552674	But getting closer to the end.
1552694	1553814	I'm back in the main story now.
1554474	1557176	I'm climbing a big tower, for those of you that know the game.
1557517	1559218	And probably ring a bell to some of you.
1559779	1560819	Are you running up that hill?
1561240	1562181	Yes, I'm running up that hill.
1564042	1565363	To make a deal with a foul sea.
1566444	1567986	And convince them to swap our places.
1569527	1569887	Let's see.
1570548	1572790	And then, you know, Warcraft and all that other fun stuff.
1572970	1574391	Alright, that's it for my game of the week.
1575973	1577854	Let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1577914	1583356	Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR and Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1584297	1585057	Big welcome to you.
1585697	1594041	Whether it be your first time or your 400th time listening to the show, please always feel free to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or join us live.
1594401	1595922	The chatters would love to see some new people.
1595982	1601124	Sunday nights here at All Games Radio is where we tape Orange Lounge Radio, www.
1602865	1604067	I need to give a shout out as well.
1604087	1604768	This is important.
1605208	1608633	We just celebrated a big anniversary a couple weeks ago, our ninth anniversary.
1609053	1619907	But next week on All Games Radio, or this Saturday, depending on when you're listening, July 16th is the 10th anniversary of Under Sedation Live.
1620407	1620827	and DarkSakura.com
1650011	1655860	The show's just missing me, but I'm going to be back on Saturday to say hello for the 10th anniversary.
1656921	1657903	Happy 10th anniversary.
1657963	1662189	And I know it's just going to be Travis dogging me for three hours, but...
1662625	1663085	That's okay.
1663125	1664065	We gave him a little fodder.
1664225	1665806	He's great.
1666306	1670167	After 10 years of hard work, I suppose he's earned it.
1671127	1674988	But not that I'm going to go quietly.
1675048	1676548	That's all I'm going to say about that.
1677209	1679569	I'm a lot bitchier now than I was 10 years ago.
1681050	1682170	No, seriously, though, it'll be fun.
1682210	1682750	So check that out.
1682810	1684590	Saturday night at All Games Radio.
1684610	1685911	More information at understationlive.org.
1687171	1688515	Now we can get into some gaming news.
1688675	1695091	Let's talk about what's going on in the gaming industry this week and get your thoughts live in our chat room at chat.orangelandre.com and on the Skype line later on.
1695412	1696254	Loki, start us off.
1697584	1706890	Yes, Square Enix was a little bit sad after their game Deus Ex Human Revolution has been leaked out to the public.
1707830	1714114	Apparently, preview code for the game, which was hosted on Steam, the account was hacked.
1715175	1723340	It was a game preview code meant for people in the preview review program, kind of for the press.
1723960	1734011	and one of the outlets, I guess, it's a French outlet, their account got hacked and this game was downloaded and then, of course, it spread out there kind of like wildfire.
1735132	1744402	Right now, they're going after 15 unnamed John Does and seeking monetary damage in excess of $5,000 for the preview's distribution.
1744482	1745163	Now, the game wasn't
1745923	1750388	I mean, but it was, you know, kind of a preview build that leaked out there.
1750928	1753651	And obviously this is not the first time that something like this has happened.
1753671	1757955	You know, I remember not too long ago, Crisis 2, same thing happened to that.
1757975	1761879	And God, how many other games preview builds get leaked out for me?
1763280	1763620	A lot.
1764922	1766163	But they are none too happy about that.
1769736	1770377	Interesting.
1773580	1782009	Steam's supposed to be like this super secure thing, and it's interesting that the game kind of leaked off of it when it sounds like this might be more of like an error.
1782697	1783218	or some sort.
1783618	1789382	And my mistake, actually, it was an Italian gaming outlet that leaked that out or that the account got hacked from.
1790343	1791484	Not Steam, then, to clarify.
1791504	1793486	Yeah, they said... Never mind, then.
1793506	1795167	It seems to be kind of confusing where it's come from.
1795187	1797909	It says, it seems that even Square doesn't know yet.
1798409	1807817	Rather than aim its suit at the Italian gaming outlet, the Japanese publisher is instead directing its legal team at the 15 people that stole the game.
1809018	1814401	or I guess that are distributing the game because I know it takes 15 people to download a game.
1814501	1817923	They don't know who they are because it's going to be 15 IP addresses basically.
1818003	1818664	Pretty much, yeah.
1818844	1821446	Interesting.
1821726	1823127	What do you think about a case like this?
1823167	1825248	Do you think Square has a case against these folks?
1825848	1827389	If they can track them down, yeah.
1827590	1829051	Because they hacked into someone's account.
1830792	1834174	So the crime that's committed is impersonating someone else's account to get the game.
1834946	1835266	Well, yeah.
1835647	1835807	Yeah.
1837009	1837449	We'll see.
1837890	1840373	But what if those people come back and say, oh, it wasn't my IP.
1840854	1841575	I wasn't driving.
1842776	1844058	Somebody hacked into my Wi-Fi.
1845203	1848046	That's the problem, because it is the burden of proof.
1848366	1852030	They need to have the proof that they did it, and just seeing that you have your IP.
1852070	1854192	Well, people can spoof IPs easy.
1856595	1867746	Especially if they're smart, if these people are the smart hacker types, obviously they're going to be running their IP through proxies and stuff like that, so it'll be even more difficult to track them down.
1867906	1868107	Mm-hmm.
1869447	1870288	I gotta ask you about this.
1870348	1875931	Not to get too tangenty, but since you brought up the whole IP spoofing, it made me think of this, a big article I read this week.
1876311	1888017	What do you think about this whole agreement that I'm hearing that was passed this week between the major ISPs, including Comcast, AT&T, and a bunch of the other big ones, and copyright holders, essentially?
1890738	1901865	We are going to notify users when IPs are identified, which is kind of what was already being done, but now I think it's more streamlined and consistent between all the companies.
1902805	1908588	And if a user keeps ignoring the alerts, they will get pop-ups that they have to acknowledge.
1909889	1911530	They might even get phone calls at some point.
1911590	1911890	I don't know.
1911910	1914532	I haven't obviously read too far into this.
1915512	1915792	I don't know.
1915812	1916993	What do you think about this whole thing?
1917524	1920527	Um, well, there's a couple things that are weird about it.
1921307	1937419	One, it would have to be, um, the way I understood it was, I believe, it's gonna be like, for example, like, if you were downloading TV episodes or something like that off of BitTorrent or something, and they figured out that you were doing it, or your IP was attached to it, they would notify you.
1938340	1943985	To make sure that it's not, say, someone jumping onto your Wi-Fi or something like that.
1945346	1947468	They would notify you that that's going on.
1947508	1953352	If you ignore that, and then they keep sending you notices, eventually they will start throttling your internet and whatnot.
1953693	1959597	But the problem is, I don't think the actual Comcast or something like that are monitoring traffic.
1959617	1964121	I mean, it would be very difficult for them to figure out what you're downloading online.
1964161	1974066	Well, the copyright holders will kind of... I'm assuming what they do is they seek out the torrent and they download it and they can see all the IPs that are sharing it.
1974167	1978789	And so they send requests to the ISPs of all those IP addresses.
1978809	1980030	But here's the funny thing, though, too.
1980590	1986914	I mean, you can... There's a way that you can get around with them tracking where you're actually browsing.
1986954	1987374	I mean, but...
1988455	1993258	for one, using a DNS that's not provided by your ISP.
1993418	1996761	You can use 4.2.2.1 or whatever is one of those.
1997561	2007048	I think they have ways you can even download BitTorrent via proxy or something like that.
2009210	2025472	and you know what there's other options out there other than BitTorrent I mean not just BitTorrent but there's you know like news groups and there's you know just plain straight up hosting a file on like one of the file sharing sites like Megal Upload or you know RapidShare you know
2026073	2032716	So do you think this is going to be another case of the piracy will just evolve like it did when Napster got shut down?
2032756	2036298	I don't think anything's really changing too much.
2036398	2039300	They're kind of doing it to scare people, I think.
2039320	2043802	To get them saying, oh, we're going to be watching what you're doing.
2043842	2048605	And that's just if you're interested in stealing music or...
2050529	2052210	Music or TV or something like that.
2053471	2058633	I don't think game publishers or PC publishers are really going out there hunting these people down.
2059073	2062055	So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff out there that's still going to get pirated.
2063035	2063596	But you know what?
2063616	2066597	The RIA and the MPA, two people that are backing this.
2067158	2067538	Of course.
2068578	2069759	Of course they're supporting it, yeah.
2069779	2077723	Because all the backers are just all the MPA, the RIA, and then all the film and music studios and stuff like that.
2077783	2078323	You don't see any...
2079904	2091376	Well, the thing that surprised me most about the law was this whole fact that if you want to dispute it, you can, but you have to pay $35 to have that investigated.
2091456	2093818	And something about that kind of struck me as wrong.
2094439	2102166	I don't like the fact that – and granted, I try to have a secure setup in my home and all this stuff, but there's just something about –
2102967	2104328	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2123146	2124146	Bill, yep, you know what?
2124166	2125527	What if you have no other options in your neighborhood?
2125547	2132650	Like, I have to use one particular ISP in my neighborhood and I have no other options unless I want to go to DSL, which I really don't want to do.
2132670	2134230	I don't know, file suit with the Better Business Bureau?
2134291	2135511	I don't really know what you could do.
2135691	2136311	I don't know either.
2136611	2138632	I'm sure you could, you can get around it, I'm sure.
2138652	2139833	That's the sticking point for me.
2139893	2143254	I mean, I don't, I don't really pirate games.
2143674	2145155	I don't pirate games.
2145555	2149837	The last time I would ever pirate a game was back in the PlayStation 1 days.
2150397	2151878	I would do import games.
2153118	2153498	Blink, blink
2172489	2185679	But, you know, I'm not gonna get on a moral soapbox about it or what have you, it's just, you know, it's just the way it is So, um, but, if I'm gonna download, like, last night's episode of The Voice, like, really?
2186840	2189803	I'm gonna get my ISP shut off over that?
2189943	2192585	Like, it just, just kinda stinks, I don't know
2194546	2195247	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2212262	2213363	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2230160	2231401	There's ways around everything.
2231702	2242813	As soon as they figure out what they're doing to find these people or whatever, there will be new programs, there will be new protocols, whatever, that people will develop in order to get around it.
2242993	2251862	They're already renaming torrent files with weird spaces between letters and special characters and things, so...
2254532	2255372	You'd be surprised.
2255412	2258855	They are going after some TV show watchers.
2259575	2263037	And who was it in chat said they got a letter about Game of Thrones?
2263077	2263398	Oh, there it is.
2263458	2267060	Ranma, I got a notice the other week about someone in my house downloading Game of Thrones.
2267680	2270062	Granted, that's an HBO show, and HBO is a paid network.
2270122	2272183	I mean, I sort of see where they are.
2272203	2273244	I mean, that is a huge...
2273544	2274184	I hope it doesn't become that.
2293069	2296691	I'll say right now, I download Supernatural because I hate watching commercials.
2297772	2299793	And so I'll just watch it on my computer.
2300233	2304376	But I also own several of the box sets of the seasons anyway.
2304656	2308958	Because I was going to say, Devil's Advocate, commercials are what make the TV shows free.
2310259	2313601	But I also have the box sets.
2314962	2316443	And a bunch of merchandise.
2317383	2318064	I have the comics.
2318084	2320005	You could probably watch them all on Netflix anyway.
2321050	2330636	probably yeah but I mean but regardless you know there's episodes I believe up on uh WB's website not W why am I saying WB it's uh
2332976	2333376	CW.
2333637	2335198	CW, yeah, on their website.
2335858	2337499	So, I mean, it's not like it's a big deal.
2337559	2338480	I just hate commercials.
2339961	2341362	Now it's all about product placement.
2341382	2342563	That's why we have more product placement.
2342623	2354011	Oh, did you hear about what they're doing with some of the old episodes of How I Met Your Mother and stuff like that where they're digitally altering them now where they're adding TVs and stuff in the background with stuff on them for different movies?
2354031	2354371	Uh-uh.
2354411	2356353	Yeah, there's reruns of some of the 2009 episodes are like that.
2358354	2364435	with the zookeeper in the background or was it Country Strong or something like that?
2365336	2367256	I hadn't heard about that.
2367716	2371177	Nothing in the world would get me to go see the zookeeper.
2371357	2377198	Maybe if someone threatened to kill my family if I wouldn't go watch the movie, then maybe I guess I would have to go see the movie.
2377218	2380159	You'd have to debate how much you love your family.
2380239	2381919	There would be that moment of pause.
2384820	2389043	But, I mean, seriously, that movie looks so awful, I can't even.
2390103	2398228	Anyhow, real quick, before we start jumping back into actual pertinent information, have you seen the trailer for Jack and Jill yet?
2399529	2400009	I don't think so.
2400069	2403632	It's a new Adam Sandler movie where he plays both Jack and Jill.
2403792	2404972	No, I haven't heard that.
2405233	2406513	You think the zookeeper looks bad.
2409456	2411177	I... Does he have sex with himself?
2411197	2412839	Because Divine did that in the 70s.
2412959	2414000	No, no, no, no.
2414340	2414720	Alright.
2416142	2417803	But it looks fucking terrible.
2417943	2419204	Alright, let's get back to game stuff.
2419224	2419485	Sorry.
2419885	2420626	How about the Wii U?
2420666	2421146	Wii U!
2422267	2424249	Talking about why was the Wii U shown?
2424269	2428613	You know, a lot of folks at E3, and I think I had said this too, when the Wii U was shown was said...
2429417	2431618	Nintendo, maybe Nintendo did this too early.
2431998	2438000	Maybe they should have just waited until they actually had a little bit more to show, like, I don't know, some actual games and not just a bunch of concepts.
2438381	2441802	Well, Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo,
2442870	2450292	has said that, you know what, maybe the Nintendo did show the Wii earlier than they had planned due to an increased fear of leaks.
2450312	2452653	What do you mean, fear of leaks?
2452693	2453753	There were already leaks.
2454113	2455313	I know, right?
2455874	2458534	What more could they have possibly leaked out about that system?
2458614	2459355	Here's a quote.
2459595	2467657	In the past, when Nintendo did not receive as much attention as we do now, we did not have to worry about the spread of our confidential information since it did not have any value in society.
2467997	2471158	But since the Nintendo DS and the Wii created a social phenomenon...
2471678	2474080	I like how they kind of just slip that in there.
2474100	2475160	Please.
2475200	2477062	Their whole social phenomenon.
2477482	2479803	But it's actually blowing smoke up their own ass.
2479924	2482485	Like, that's literally what they're doing in that statement.
2482826	2488349	You know, since we decided that, you know, our systems are just revolutionizing the world.
2488389	2492012	In fact, you know, we would go as far as saying they're about to cure cancer.
2492132	2493953	But, you know, hey.
2495100	2497742	That's what the fans are saying about our system.
2498603	2500704	Why doesn't he just say, thanks to the internet?
2501265	2508570	Because back in the day, you would get the word from the Nintendo Fun Club or Nintendo Power, which ironically enough, we're also both Nintendo.
2508590	2514494	You have to understand, because we're so awesome now... Let me show you this graphic behind me here.
2514875	2518838	You see right here, we were awesome, but now we are like ten times as awesome.
2518858	2520139	You do understand, that is...
2520799	2521220	and much more.
2541306	2546588	Anyhow, Nintendo's next move commands great attention and extreme news value.
2547048	2557791	Therefore, although we go to great lengths to ensure that this will not happen, there are cases where, even if a person receives information under a non-disclosure agreement, the information is leaked because there is great temptation.
2558331	2566533	Even for the Wii U, some people may be aware, if they had been checking the internet, that information with true and false rumors mixed together was spread on the internet before the announcement.
2567013	2569274	So they kind of admit that, yeah, some of it was out there.
2569734	2577637	Therefore, as for new hardware, even if we wanted to, it is extremely challenging to realize a situation where a product is announced and then launched the next day.
2579018	2581339	So, let's summarize that quote in our own words.
2582119	2595485	Because we are so fucking awesome that everybody wants to report on our farts and has reported on our farts, we had to, you left us no choice but to get up on the E3 stage and fart.
2596980	2597160	Wee!
2597220	2597341	Wee!
2603186	2604667	Here's the thing, they don't have to do shit.
2604847	2605868	They don't have to do anything.
2607229	2608870	They're succumbing to peer pressure.
2608890	2609810	That's because they're farting.
2630183	2631123	It's called a guillotine.
2631303	2633304	It's called repercussions for people violating your NDA.
2633324	2635344	That's why you have a nondisclosure agreement.
2635364	2636225	Take those fuckers to court.
2661829	2663270	It's in there, I mean, come on.
2663350	2665091	It's like, you know.
2666392	2667793	Oh, you want to learn about the new Pokemon game?
2667853	2670355	Too bad, because you're going to have to wait until after retail.
2670735	2674057	Was Nintendo really worried about disappointing at E3 this year?
2674117	2679721	Because, like, seriously, Reggie could have just got up on stage and just hula-hooped for 30 minutes.
2680201	2684524	And there would be that analysis on X-Play, like Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb.
2684924	2689287	So, the Wii Hoop, wasn't that an interesting display of, you know...
2689967	2693650	A pelvic shaking from someone who doesn't need to shake his pelvis.
2693670	2696272	I give those pelvic thrusts a 4 out of 5.
2696352	2699574	Rob, if they didn't talk about the Wii U, what the fuck would they have talked about?
2699614	2702757	Because seriously, they had nothing to announce this year.
2702957	2703577	They had nothing.
2703818	2705719	It was like, hey, yeah, well we
2706839	2715321	They could have stretched the fuck out of those discussions of the Wii games that they didn't really show, like Rhythm Heaven and all the stuff that Wii Poo Poo.
2715601	2717041	And would they have gotten slammed for that?
2717361	2718122	Probably.
2718462	2723883	But then they could have shown the trailer for The Last Story or Xenoblade, which we all think is happening anyway.
2724143	2729424	I think most of us going into E3 were pretty convinced that Nintendo was going to show The Last Story for an American release.
2729824	2735026	Why is it so difficult if they're planning on working on that anyways, or they're planning on bringing that over, that they could announce that?
2735166	2738948	Even if, you know what, they decide, hey, you know what, we're not going to bring it over here at some point.
2739288	2741109	If they change their minds, they can do that.
2741209	2742169	Games get canceled all the time.
2742370	2744030	Look at True Crime Hong Kong.
2744050	2749593	There's a big old trailer for that during Activision's conference a couple years ago, but that game got canceled.
2750353	2752694	Yeah, it sucks that it got canceled, but you know what?
2752994	2753875	Games get canceled.
2753935	2758837	So if they decide, hey, we can announce this, but there may be a chance that we're not going to bring it over here,
2759716	2760096	So what?
2760857	2761177	So what?
2761317	2762458	At least you'd have something to announce.
2762839	2766021	Instead of saying, hey, I hear you guys like Smash Brothers.
2766282	2766862	Well, guess what?
2767062	2771786	We're going to work on Smash Brothers sometime in the next couple years.
2772427	2775490	It's like, thanks, I think.
2776839	2803693	GameGuru in our chatroom at chat.org.com says they could have focused on the 3DS you know and they kind of did for half their conference their conference this year was the Zelda thing which that did feel like a bunch of hot air like I'm sorry but the whole Zelda thing it's like okay you've been showing this game for like four years and the whole symphony thing and all that was really just dragging it out like we know you're fucking showing the Wii U this is just you know this is literally just pomp and circumstance about how fucking great Nintendo is
2804053	2805574	But here's the great thing about Nintendo.
2805795	2807356	They could have done pomp and circumstance.
2807636	2812261	Like, they could have done, like, symphonic announcements for all those 3DS games.
2812281	2817986	Like, they could have had somebody dressed up as... They could have had Ranma, Black Luigi, come out and go, Hello!
2818006	2819527	And look for the ghost.
2819547	2822009	Where is Miyamoto with the fucking shield and sword?
2822049	2823371	I mean, that's, like, just, like...
2823991	2830012	That's the kind of crazy batshit stuff that they need to be doing again to get people excited about the games.
2830532	2838554	I'm sorry, you know, every time I see them put out a new Mario Kart Animal Crossing game or something like that, I mean, really, what the fuck are they doing?
2838594	2844055	They're adding some more useless garbage on top of these games, and then they're re-releasing them back out into the market.
2844515	2849356	Or, hey, look, I know you guys wanted Star Fox, so we're going to give you Star Fox that we gave you before.
2850655	2851736	Awesome!
2851816	2853578	Hey, I hear you guys like Mario Brothers.
2853598	2855919	We're going to give you Mario Brothers 64 HD.
2856520	2857441	Or in 3D.
2858722	2859462	Thanks?
2859843	2869090	I mean, it's just... It's kind of annoying that they've got... I mean, to me, I understand that there's a whole place where, hey, you know what?
2869110	2869771	These games are good.
2869791	2879839	Let's re-release them for a new generation or some garbage that you want to spew saying that basically, oh, well, we've run out of ideas, so we're just going to take some of these old games and put them back out again.
2880319	2885961	We're going to put as minimal amount of effort into them to make them look new again, but we're going to put them back out there because this is what the fans want.
2887501	2887881	You know what?
2889682	2891923	Fans, let me just talk to you here real quick.
2892883	2893723	Here's something that you can do.
2893783	2894063	Guess what?
2895124	2900065	You know that those consoles, when people are done playing them, they're still out there.
2900606	2901786	They don't just evaporate.
2902766	2903466	They are out there.
2903486	2906207	I thought they were all in a landfill in New Mexico.
2906267	2906828	It's so crazy.
2907308	2907848	Did you know
2908388	2914870	That if you want to play Ocarina of Time, you don't have to spend $299 plus $40 for the game.
2915130	2915371	What?
2915631	2916211	Yes, I know.
2916231	2917071	This is a shocker.
2917151	2918972	That's not what Beyonce told me in the ad.
2919232	2919832	I understand.
2920432	2921413	But Beyonce's full of shit.
2922679	2923420	Here's all you have to do.
2924400	2930485	You can literally go out to your local garage sales or there's this website out there called eBay where people sell things.
2930505	2933247	This is a game that Robin Williams named his daughter after.
2933387	2934107	Like, isn't that worth $300?
2934147	2936629	Yeah, but Robin Williams is kind of crazy.
2936669	2937630	Didn't you see the crazy beard?
2937650	2939832	I mean, it's starting to look like a homeless crazy beard, okay?
2939852	2940372	Yeah, a little bit.
2940392	2940872	It's a little weird.
2940952	2941973	I see where you're going with that.
2941993	2943534	He's like beyond Santa Claus.
2943554	2944415	That's an interesting angle.
2944595	2944955	Yes, I know.
2945376	2950639	Anyways, so you can go on eBay and you can buy a Nintendo 64 and Ocarina of Time.
2950800	2951220	And guess what?
2953726	2955769	Just be careful that it's not coming from China.
2956009	2956730	For a limited amount of time.
2956891	2963880	You can also probably afford within that $299 price range about, I don't know, 40 other games.
2965535	2970677	And you can play it all on your... You could buy everything on the Steam Marketplace right now for $299.
2970977	2972337	And you can play it.
2972477	2974758	And yes, it won't be in 3D, but you know what?
2974938	2976639	Actually, wrong.
2977499	2978220	It doesn't matter.
2978440	2979180	Because you know what?
2979220	2983361	You're playing with it the way it was meant to be played on Nintendo 64.
2985302	3006192	I don't understand why that's the whole thing with the 25th anniversary collection or whatever that $40 could have easily bought you $40 could have bought you a Super Nintendo we need to do a mock commercial for 3DS Ocarina of Time that has the whole like interspersed Robin Williams and his daughter and I'll play the game the way it was meant to be played just $19.99 on eBay
3008404	3009484	It's not even 1999.
3010224	3012565	I don't know.
3013165	3016166	It would have been different if it was something like, hey, you know what?
3016246	3018886	We're going to bring out a Zelda anthology.
3018906	3022427	We're going to have Zelda 1, Zelda 2, all of them on one disc.
3022727	3025028	Like they kind of did for the pre-order thing for Wind Waker.
3025348	3027188	It was a pre-order bonus!
3027568	3028888	Pre-order bonus!
3028968	3033829	Stuff that nowadays is just like a code for a shirt for my character in game.
3034109	3036530	Or armor that's red instead of silver.
3036590	3036830	I mean...
3038254	3042376	Why couldn't they just... They could sell that disc!
3042816	3060384	They could easily just stuff a couple more games on there, put Wind Waker in the box or something like that, because that game hasn't been sold forever, throw Twilight Princess back in there because, hey, you know what, just in case maybe someone doesn't have it, you know, and a little bit of extra content, and holy crap, that's a great deal and actually worth my time.
3061105	3064947	And hell, you don't have to do anything to them because people like the games the way they were.
3066826	3077419	But no, they need an excuse for people to buy the 3DS because the 3DS is kind of a gimmicky system and so what a better way to do that is to take one of their most popular Zelda games and just put it back out there.
3078359	3078739	Reggie Fils-Aimé
3101898	3104060	They're going to welcome arguments?
3128661	3129322	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3145496	3148599	To me, I don't see any publishers having trouble working with Xbox One.
3148739	3157388	This is funny because this does tie into something topical and it's the whole EA versus Steam thing that's going on that, yes, I realize comes up later in the show, but just deal.
3158749	3162473	There's this whole thing going back and forth with EA and Steam right now where Steam doesn't want the...
3163313	3180016	or Steam has forbidden the EA games to come on the marketplace for Steam and a lot of it has to do with the fact that EA wants to have their own servers for their own patches and EA wants it all to themselves and this was a big sticking point early on with Microsoft in the early days of Xbox Live.
3180456	3187417	So Nintendo in a way can kind of point at that and say we're not being lazy we're just doing what EA wants.
3187477	3190738	No they are being lazy because guess what EA who did they bring out on stage?
3191621	3191901	E.A.
3192381	3192822	But guess what?
3193042	3193342	E.A.
3193402	3194723	is still doing that, though.
3195143	3195383	E.A.
3195483	3197865	has their own, like, you have to sign in through the E.A.
3197925	3199946	service or whatever in order to play the E.A.
3199986	3200807	games online.
3201207	3201307	Right.
3201327	3202007	Because, remember, Project $10.
3202868	3204669	That's all part of that fun stuff.
3205770	3207090	And then same with, like...
3208451	3214793	I think there's some other services that Ubisoft has their kind of thing where you have to log into as well.
3214833	3220214	But EA, I know for a fact they have their EA games login that you have to do.
3220294	3222035	So they have their own thing on top of this.
3222435	3228776	The fact that they don't have a unified service or something like that is basically Nintendo's way of saying, we don't know what we're doing.
3229016	3229397	I'm sorry.
3229437	3234718	I think that's kind of what it is because they don't want to invest time into some sort of service like that and have it be inferior to Ubisoft.
3234878	3253504	Well, they sort of brought out the guy from EA, coincidentally enough, at E3, and I got the sense that, like, I don't know how much, I can't remember now how much was said about online, but I remember walking away from that, getting the sense that, like, I was actually asking myself for a minute, like, is EA doing their online stuff?
3253984	3256244	Like, is EA going to be doing the online stuff for Nintendo?
3256264	3256805	It wasn't that at all.
3256845	3261746	No, I know that's not what they ended up, but that was, like, for a moment, that was the impression I was getting about what was being said.
3261826	3263587	Because they didn't really bring up their online stuff.
3263707	3266928	All it really, to me, said is, hey, look, we have EA on board.
3266948	3268548	They believe in our system.
3268808	3271849	And EA is one of the biggest publishers in the world.
3272269	3274130	So you all should believe in our system.
3275850	3277811	Don't you see the math?
3277871	3279992	Because they believe in us, you have to believe in us.
3280672	3292362	When Nintendo would like to ask users to try a specific new game, we should deliver it to their Nintendo 3DS and possibly Wii U with their prior consent and recommend that they just try it, and if they like it, they can pay for it.
3307154	3310458	In this way, we need to introduce users to unknown products.
3311078	3320488	Consumers are likely to be convinced to pay about 5,000 yen for a well-established franchise product, but not all the people are willing to pay a certain amount of money for an innovative but unknown product.
3320928	3322890	Now is the time to prepare for these situations.
3323190	3328275	So what's interesting about that is Nintendo is basically saying, we need to find a way to just put demos on people's systems.
3329076	3329857	Now, he does it.
3329897	3334903	Now, there is a very important quote before you run away with this that says, you know, with their prior consent.
3334923	3335704	They're already doing this.
3335764	3340469	They're already doing this on the 3DS as far as like, because the stupid Pokemon thing downloaded to mine.
3340529	3341811	I'm like, I don't want this fucking shit.
3342131	3343533	No, it didn't download automatically, did it?
3343553	3344514	You had to get it through the store.
3344854	3345695	I had to get mine through the store.
3345715	3347016	No, mine downloaded automatically.
3347036	3347297	Really?
3347677	3351898	I know that OK Go video came in on one of the patches automatically, and then it was taken away.
3351918	3352519	But that's not a big deal.
3352539	3354339	I mean, they have the same type of thing right now.
3354539	3357360	In fact, I think it's still around on Xbox Live Arcade.
3357380	3362742	Remember, you could sign up, basically, and have all the demos for the games that come out downloaded to your system, and you could try them.
3362782	3363682	If you like them, then you buy them.
3364022	3364783	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3388503	3391627	I mean, Nintendo, a company that they've said, hey, you know what?
3392467	3393749	Our games are so awesome.
3393909	3394269	You remember?
3394890	3396311	Chart 10 times awesome as before.
3397393	3398534	That we don't need demos for them.
3398814	3402998	We're just going to, you know, we're putting that stuff out there and you're going to see Nintendo and you're like, oh, I got to buy that.
3404320	3406742	And so now they realize, hey, you know what?
3406942	3410546	People like playing demos to see if your game's crap or not.
3413544	3415226	I like demos and hate crap.
3417007	3418088	Do you like crappy demos?
3419069	3419209	No.
3419810	3420930	Alright, let's move on with more news.
3420950	3422452	Well, I like them because I don't have to pay for them.
3422712	3425014	DarkSakura, while you're at it, why don't you give us some more gaming news?
3425754	3427476	Well, how about some Zuni stuff?
3428464	3434947	There is a rumor that the Zune Marketplace is being revamped on Xbox 360 as a streaming video service.
3435608	3442511	And it already had the ability to stream, but this is specifically for some sort of service they're going to be offering.
3442531	3446953	I believe something along the lines of Netflix, but this of course is under the Zune brand.
3448994	3453056	Microsoft basically saying no comment, blah blah blah.
3453837	3454057	But
3455317	3456278	It could already be happening.
3456498	3465360	I mean, this could be related to what they were announcing at E3 at their press conference or maybe related to Xbox Live Diamond.
3465601	3466001	Who knows?
3467721	3469902	Like, okay, I already have Netflix.
3470396	3472617	Well, you know... I already have Hulu.
3472857	3477758	Xbox has been kind of centralizing a lot of their stuff lately and kind of folding in dated brands.
3477778	3481099	Like we had the story last week about Game for Windows kind of becoming Xbox.com.
3481459	3485301	So the fact, you know, didn't Xbox stop making the Zune like about a year and a half ago?
3485461	3485721	Yeah.
3485761	3489982	So it's no surprise at all that something had to happen to the Zune marketplace, so...
3490242	3494164	Well, and it makes sense to me because I look at even like the PlayStation Network and stuff.
3494184	3497326	They have, I don't even know how many streaming services on there.
3497346	3497987	Sony has one.
3498007	3504691	They have Vudu and Netflix and I'm sure Hulu Plus is on there.
3504771	3506132	And I don't even know.
3506252	3507773	I think there's a few other ones on top of that.
3508073	3512596	So it makes sense that they would have a few different offerings on the Xbox marketplace as well.
3512616	3514117	They got to do something with that Zoom name.
3517340	3519202	I would imagine that they're not going to call it the Zune.
3519362	3523266	They're probably just going to have some Microsoft streaming service or something like that.
3523286	3526009	I don't know.
3526589	3527250	This is kind of funny.
3527790	3530433	Remember how we talked about Gears War 3 leaking out last week?
3532094	3534657	Well, who possibly could have leaked this out?
3535077	3538861	But actually, it's funny because it was leaked out by a...
3540541	3567671	a third party I guess outsource company that was storing the code on their website Codify they're an Australian based hosting company which lists Microsoft as a client and it literally was behind no protection whatsoever all you had to do was go to xbox.codify.com which is now obviously locked up and you can literally find the code right there
3569051	3573054	Just go and download the whole folders and everything.
3573074	3575175	It was just ripe for the picking.
3575235	3576716	That's just straight up embarrassing.
3577377	3579018	That is pretty bad.
3579298	3580839	Not even a login or password.
3581099	3582220	Nothing.
3582280	3583801	The password wasn't password.
3583921	3585442	There's just no password.
3585482	3586683	No login, no password.
3586823	3587584	That's just straight up.
3587604	3588964	There was confidential in the folder.
3589105	3590505	Oh, please.
3590786	3593127	That was a dopey thing to do.
3594208	3596029	Someone's head's rolling for that decision.
3596209	3598591	That was just a lazy, dumb thing to do.
3599731	3600072	It is pretty bad.
3614637	3622043	and clearly this company has no security officer, cyber security person, specialist.
3622343	3626406	Clearly this company has none of that or that person has been on vacation for six months.
3626706	3630329	Dude, I mean, you could seriously host this stuff on...
3632879	3634421	on any of these file sharing sites.
3634681	3642150	Hell, they could have used a site like Mega Upload or something like that, some ridiculously stupid website.
3642711	3644473	And at least that you can put a password on.
3645541	3646802	This site, nothing.
3647242	3650384	Randy in our chatroom says, somewhere an employee is being yelled at.
3650665	3655548	I would say somewhere in a Microsoft meeting, an agreement is being terminated with this company.
3656128	3656749	I'd say that.
3658610	3663113	It's going to be a lot more serious, and then people at that said company are going to lose their jobs.
3663153	3666795	And the sad thing is, it's not going to be anybody involved with this.
3666955	3667456	It'll be the...
3668456	3671397	It's the fault of the executive who didn't hire a privacy person.
3671417	3677960	You know what's funny, too, is not only was the game leaked, but there was some of the tools that they used for the game as well leaked with it.
3678360	3679220	Jeez.
3679380	3680000	It's awesome.
3681001	3682921	It's just sad.
3684002	3684342	All right.
3685582	3692025	These rumors will never go away, but we've got to address them because it's making the way around the game blogs.
3692825	3706820	Let's see, Taiwan-based component makers, according to Digitimes, have said that the PlayStation 4 will feature body movement control, similar to Kinect, and it's going to be released in 2012.
3707721	3711966	This is coming from Foxconn and... I'm sorry, it's not coming from, but the...
3712927	3719450	Report is further saying that Foxconn and Pegatron Technology, who make the PS3, they will also be working on the PlayStation 4.
3720450	3724312	The shipment volume of the PlayStation 4 in 2012 is supposed to be at least 20 million units.
3725372	3726033	So there you go.
3726433	3730075	Supposedly, the PlayStation 4 is coming out as soon as next year.
3731855	3734436	There's a few things that seem a little weird about that.
3734757	3739979	Very well, let's say if it was actually coming out next year, then yes, it would probably have to be starting production right now on that.
3741519	3746401	But a few things that seem kind of off on that is the fact that they're looking to ship 20 million units.
3746461	3751243	I mean, even if it was 20 million units worldwide, no console launch has been that big.
3751784	3752884	Never that big.
3752984	3757826	And that would be a lot of units just sitting there, a lot of wasted resources.
3757866	3762268	They're going to want to have that launch, basically, the numbers as...
3763468	3764009	and so on.
3786508	3788689	I mean, that would be a lot, just like right away.
3788989	3791730	So 20 million, that seems wrong.
3792990	3798452	The other thing that strikes me as odd about this story is the whole it will feature body movement control like Microsoft's Kinect.
3799113	3805635	I'm looking at that a little bit through side-eye because that would show me that Sony has already abandoned the move.
3806315	3807536	I wouldn't doubt that they would, though.
3807576	3808336	That makes sense.
3809377	3830039	I'm a little yes and no on that I mean the move definitely probably is not broken through the way it should have or the way that Kinect has but at the same time I don't I don't know there's a part of me that wants to say Kinect hasn't really proven itself but at the same time yes it is the fastest selling hardware despite the you know I feel like the Kinect is in the rut that the Wii was in at the same time we all should have seen it coming
3830539	3857813	that you know after the initial wave of games there's just kind of a bunch of finger tapping on the desk there's not a lot and not a lot that we got excited about at E3 this year either there will be some stuff coming out but yeah it's not it's not really a lot of stuff that's diverting from what's already out there you know there's gonna be dancing games because obviously those have done well there's gonna be sports games because those have done well there's gonna be you know kind of the same type of fairy that you would see on like the Wii because that's just what's working um
3858954	3869540	Yeah, and the other thing you also have to consider too is that they're still making PS3s, and the PS3 is going to be their push, especially with the fourth quarter that they have right now.
3870001	3877685	They're going to be wanting to have tons of PS3 units, and it's going to be hard to have two systems being manufactured at the same time.
3880287	3882347	I just don't see it happening this soon.
3882587	3884468	I think they're just going to stick to their 10-year plan.
3884788	3886128	Because they kind of did that with the move.
3886188	3889450	And I don't know if they've really tapped out yet with what they can do on the PS3.
3889550	3890310	I hope not.
3890330	3893831	I think that they can do a lot more.
3893891	3903159	And it's still at the end of the day, it's still a cheap Blu-ray player for a lot of people that, you know, are as Blu-ray is getting into more and more homes as HDTV is getting more and more homes.
3903859	3908924	I think, you know, Sony still has that advantage that they're the only ones as a Blu-ray player still at the end of the day.
3909504	3914466	So, you know, and I think that's been helping move a lot more units than they might want to admit.
3915466	3918807	That they would probably chalk up to the quality of the games and so forth.
3918847	3921408	But I think the fact that it's a Blu-ray player has been really moving it.
3921688	3923088	So where the hell does the story come from?
3923148	3924249	Is it just a bunch of bullshit?
3924369	3930091	Or could it maybe be that there's some type of new PlayStation 3 redesign in the works?
3930551	3933692	I could see that before I would believe that a PlayStation 4 is in the works.
3934032	3935733	Like yet another PlayStation 3 Slim.
3937573	3940256	Maybe with Move more integrated into it or something.
3940316	3946022	I don't know if they would do that, but I don't buy this yet.
3946843	3949265	Other than someone saying, oh, well, this is what's going to happen.
3949305	3956393	We haven't seen any... Like with the Foxconn announcements, usually a lot of that will see pictures of the motherboards or something like that for these and
3957213	3959615	Um, you know, some sort of physical evidence for it.
3959635	3965439	Because right now, just one person saying that that works because you work at a... I mean, you don't even know if you work there.
3965679	3971744	To just say that you're a worker for one of these places doesn't necessarily... I don't know.
3971924	3973145	I don't know if I can trust that source.
3974125	3977448	I would just be willing to bet right now that it's probably...
3979683	3983665	I think it's going to be a while still before we see the new console.
3984026	3986047	Unless, of course, the Wii U really takes off.
3986227	3989670	I think they're going to have to speed things along a bit.
3990451	3996455	Honestly, with the Wii U, I don't think it's going to all of a sudden just take over.
3996495	3996715	I mean...
3997976	4003400	The Wii is still the number one selling console right now, but I don't think it's... I don't think it is anymore.
4003620	4003780	Really?
4003800	4011586	If you look at the monthly numbers, I think... I haven't been able to look at the NPD reports that have changed, so I haven't gotten to see a lot of stuff, but, you know...
4013808	4018631	I think it's still cumulatively the top overall, but it's not the month-to-month bestseller.
4018651	4019151	That's what I meant.
4019272	4021853	Overall, it's the largest selling system.
4024154	4030038	I don't think that this Wii U is going to be able to pull Wii numbers again.
4031179	4039283	It's kind of like, well, we've already seen that, and yeah, the tablet thing is a little bit new, but I don't know if it's going to be enough to get people into it.
4039323	4040344	I mean, look at the 3DS.
4040504	4041164	Perfect example.
4042565	4043907	The 3D's new.
4044207	4053638	Granted, if all things were correct, if they had a good launch lineup, I think that thing should have done really well, but they just aren't utilizing it enough.
4053658	4054539	3D looks okay, but...
4057422	4058043	It's just nothing.
4058243	4060525	It's like I kind of seen the tilt controls.
4060625	4061446	I've seen that before.
4062247	4063368	All this stuff, I've seen this before.
4063408	4064509	It's not new.
4066030	4066371	All right.
4067151	4068032	One more story for you guys.
4068052	4072316	Then we're going to travel around the world and look at release dates and what's coming out in a country near you.
4072376	4073377	But first, releases.
4073758	4074058	I'm sorry.
4074118	4075239	First, a story from Dark Sakura.
4075519	4076040	Then releases.
4076340	4078861	I was about to say, what are you doing skipping my story?
4079861	4088223	Well, the PSP had a digital comic service and Sony said, nope, not anymore, cut.
4088883	4090404	Yes, it is going away.
4091524	4103127	It has over 4,000 different comic book issues on it, but the digital comics is going away, for the PSP at least.
4103567	4107610	It may go to other Sony devices, but not to the PSP.
4107770	4112333	I think they're getting ready to transition to VitaLand.
4115461	4116041	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4143499	4143579	Hmm.
4172488	4173249	That's how I see it.
4173309	4180795	And honestly, I really don't care because you have to be really careful when doing comics for a small screen format.
4182196	4184058	And sometimes you lose something.
4184638	4186580	Maybe at the end of the day, they just weren't selling.
4187554	4188835	IOS Digital Distribution Digital Distribution
4205603	4206044	It could be.
4206744	4209928	And honestly, I've had a few different comic book readers on my iPhone.
4210729	4218458	But the ones that I always thought were the best well done were the ones that were standalone releases through the...
4220580	4222141	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4246693	4248794	I'm going to our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com.
4248814	4251616	There's actually a little bit of love going on for Marvel's digital service.
4251676	4254457	DDR Dollar Bill says, I like Marvel's digital service.
4255097	4257879	GameGuru says, I started using Marvel's digital service myself.
4258599	4260180	Robert M in our chatroom says, stinks.
4260520	4262781	Will the PSP app still be available for back issues?
4262821	4263422	That's a good question.
4263882	4265123	I think the app's still going to be there.
4265283	4267244	I don't see why they would close the app.
4267264	4273288	And I would imagine there are agreements with the publishers to allow it so that if you have purchased a comic, you get to keep it.
4273749	4275310	There's no reason for them to take it down.
4275810	4277111	They said nothing about taking it down.
4277191	4278652	They just are going to stop supporting it.
4278892	4279112	Right.
4279733	4281054	It'll be like Microsoft Game Room.
4281394	4286637	If you really want to go into Game Room and download a lot of the old games, you can, but a new game hasn't come out in about a year now.
4287018	4291721	Yeah, but they're not going to deny people who have already used the service because that would just be really crappy.
4291821	4292281	Exactly.
4292321	4293002	That's exactly it.
4294091	4308708	and for the record, Marvel's digital comic service is really nice very easy to use and I've caught up on Avengers West Coast very quickly with that one of these days I'll get me an iPad and I'll check that out but we'll see
4310248	4311089	Moise off from that.
4311209	4313811	All right, let's go travel the world and look at some release dates.
4313871	4316112	What is coming to a gaming store near you?
4316192	4318214	Loki, start us off with the U.S.
4319074	4320035	Not a whole lot this week.
4320555	4324778	Starting off with NCAA football for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4326680	4330663	Gods and Heroes Rome Rising Collector's Edition out this week on PC.
4332044	4332604	Let's see.
4332684	4338068	The Elder Scrolls Oblivion 5th Anniversary Edition with a nice little map in there and some DLC stuff.
4338868	4362422	Plus $10 towards Skyrim And that's only $30 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PC UFC Personal Trainer on the Wii And let's see here
4364133	4365073	And that's actually it.
4384720	4401517	Wangan Midnight gets a price reduction on July 14th it moves into the PlayStation 3 best as does White Knight Chronicles 2 moves into the best series and I believe the American or the Europe release of that is not too far away I've been reading some early reviews on it that have not been too kind
4402758	4412425	Also on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan, Brink and Tencho no Eagle, as well as GQ Powerful Pro Yaku 2011 comes out this week.
4412785	4417809	That is a baseball game from Konami with chibi little characters.
4418449	4420271	Not a series I believe we have over here.
4421191	4422952	Look at some of the other systems.
4423052	4425093	Trying to see if there's actually anything on the Wii at all.
4426294	4427155	I don't think so.
4427215	4428555	But we do have the PSP.
4429236	4433598	We have Taiko no Tatoujin Portable DX comes out.
4434398	4438201	Music game fans may recognize that as the Taiko drumming game.
4438661	4441722	Looks like there's a new version of that on its way to the PSP this week in Japan.
4442143	4445144	As well as Unchained Blades Rex comes out this week.
4445725	4445865	And...
4446845	4471825	Ys gets price reductions all over the place as they move into the best series Ys 1 and 2, Ys 7 and Ys vs Sora no Kisuke Alternative Saga all those are getting price reductions this week so if you're an Ys fan that's late to the party in Japan good news, you get to get in cheap now Ys 3 is the best one game of note on the Wii it's coming out on July 16th from level 5 Inazuma 11 Strikers
4473986	4476327	It's a sports game coming out from level 5.
4476707	4477468	It's a soccer game.
4478108	4482770	Looks like it incorporates characters from various other games and anime.
4483430	4486632	So it looks like kind of like a fan wank soccer game.
4487312	4487972	Good times.
4489353	4492374	All right, let's move on with the UK dates.
4493573	4495875	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2
4522011	4522371	Told ya.
4551944	4556329	You know, this isn't the first time now that I think of it that Capcom has fucked up a save system.
4556349	4558011	You may remember Dead Rising 1.
4559273	4560654	They had real issues with that.
4560674	4564859	It's like, do you guys not know how to program save games correctly?
4564959	4566241	Is that really a problem for you?
4566921	4586133	um but they're saying though um it that their intent was never quite malicious um you know despite the conspiracy theories out there that would have you believe and uh that they said that the inability to reset saves was a conscious design decision aimed at maintaining the arcade fighter feeling of the title
4587314	4588595	That's so much bullshit.
4588635	4591597	It's just ridiculous.
4591897	4599524	Although they did release this statement, and now I'm wondering, I don't know if it's bullshit so much as it just was a dumb decision.
4600325	4605789	I wonder if somebody didn't really say, we don't need to program in the save-delete thing.
4605929	4606569	It's like an arcade.
4606589	4607890	Let's just skip that part.
4607930	4609091	Just a dumb decision.
4609431	4622840	There is a device out there, though, that will actually erase those save games that I saw out there because there was an article I saw where they're recommending, well, one of the two ways you can delete your save games, one, through the game to a campfire, two, use this device.
4623421	4629164	The device apparently allows you to backup game saves on 3DS and DS and also allows you to erase them.
4630145	4630316	Thanks for watching!
4631331	4633092	They could easily just fix this with a patch.
4633832	4636333	You know, 3DS games are... You can patch those.
4636614	4638014	Remember, Capcom, you can patch them.
4638434	4640075	You do this shit on consoles.
4640375	4642857	I mean, why don't you just say, hey, you know what?
4643377	4644017	We fucked up.
4644197	4646618	You guys want your save, reset stuff.
4646698	4647159	I'll tell you what.
4647199	4649540	We're going to go ahead and patch it in so you can reset your saves.
4650100	4652201	But no, they're being dicks, so... Fine.
4652661	4653001	That's fine.
4653342	4657164	I wasn't going to buy this game anyways, and... Even less reason to do so now.
4658184	4659945	Yeah, it's kind of one of those games that...
4660426	4663195	I probably wouldn't have bought it anyway, but I especially am not gonna buy it now.
4664221	4671004	Anyhow, let's move on to a story that's actually, I think this is kind of one of those pretty awesome stories I want to talk about here.
4671024	4675707	And this has to do with Dr. Stephen Hicks, who is a clinical neurologist at the University of Oxford.
4676647	4684391	He is working on some glasses that has technology that's inspired by Xbox 360 Kinect games, iPads.
4684731	4689733	And what these glasses are, they're to help blind folks see shapes and people better.
4690134	4692755	And it uses the technology of the Kinect and the iPads.
4693836	4721872	It's mostly for folks that can detect light But they can't fully see The glasses would use these cameras That would be on corners of the lenses To detect the information And then it would send it to a little computer Because everything is so tiny these days I guess it's all in the glasses The computer will then translate the information And transmit it to LEDs inside the lenses of the glasses And those LEDs would light up in patterns That you would be trained to understand
4722973	4723473	The Visor
4749887	4750567	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4769773	4770834	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4794364	4804153	and so a person wearing these glasses, the laser could scan that QR code from a distance and tell that person in their ear, this is the bus that goes to market, you know, or whatever.
4804473	4805654	I mean, that's amazing.
4807456	4808556	That's actually a really good idea.
4808597	4809337	Copyright it real quick.
4809577	4810098	Patent pending.
4810638	4811219	Patent pending.
4813988	4814528	But you know what I mean.
4814829	4815929	I got to hand it to this guy.
4815969	4819171	I mean thinking to put the Kinect in glasses is a pretty good idea.
4819751	4825955	I'm just saying we have this very scan society where we scan codes and now it's an iPhone application.
4826215	4827936	Why can't the visor scan those codes?
4828677	4829497	That would be amazing.
4832019	4834100	Kaijudo says name them Kinect specs.
4835618	4836218	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4852580	4854982	I read this and I go, it's going to help the blind see.
4855022	4856443	And I go, oh, that's a great thing.
4856943	4859084	But I'm not actually blind.
4859144	4864488	So I would like to hear from somebody to let me know if this is actually going to be a great thing.
4864508	4875874	They're actually also working on retinal patches that are supposed to rework the way the optic nerve takes in the information for cases of people with nerve damage.
4876175	4876355	Okay.
4877075	4905918	and it's actually very similar in theory because these are actually relaying it's like they've got these implants that relay information directly into the optic nerve so that people can quote see but it's a lot of the same theory too instead it's just a matter of instead of directing going directly into the nerve it's a matter of providing a projection a display that can be recognizable to people with that level of vision so yeah that makes sense
4906498	4910860	Kai Judo in the chatroom says, 800 Microsoft points if you want to keep seeing past three months.
4911080	4911780	That's wrong.
4911980	4912801	That's just wrong.
4915522	4920104	They do say that the goal is to bring in the glasses at under 1,000 pounds each.
4920124	4922404	Because remember, this is being researched at Oxford University.
4923465	4926266	But still, I mean, that sounds really expensive.
4926386	4930208	But for a piece of technology that you would use...
4931688	4936530	Everywhere, every day actually does not seem so bad at all and pretty affordable.
4936950	4937690	That's pretty awesome.
4938210	4943172	Misty in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com says, Hey, pew-pewing QR codes is fun.
4943672	4946974	You know, there is something about those QR codes.
4947034	4950495	They're all ads for something, but yet she's right.
4950515	4952455	There's something about scanning those codes.
4952536	4953336	It's kind of fun.
4954016	4964160	but I'm just saying why not like really give those codes like a real practical purpose that could actually better society rather than just giving URLs to websites and things like that.
4965088	4972813	We actually put them up for events with a lot of the stuff that we do now on School for Advertising.
4973233	4977696	We actually include the QR codes for the charity events for student council stuff.
4978776	4982558	So they use them a lot in terms of passing along event information.
4982598	4986961	And I actually find them a lot of times, oddly enough, on Japanese blogs.
4987381	4987741	Interesting.
4987961	4988241	Oh, yeah.
4988281	4989281	Well, yeah.
4989442	4992322	They've been having to scan the code things for forever.
4992622	4995663	You know, mobile phones have always been more advanced over there.
4995703	5002285	It isn't until we got the iPhone when finally even they started looking at our phones going, hmm, we like that.
5002325	5004705	But I mean, for the longest time, they were far more advanced.
5004865	5007286	Remember the After Years, Final Fantasy IV, the After Years on the Wii?
5007306	5008986	That was originally a mobile phone game in Japan.
5009046	5015268	Well, keep in mind, too, is that cellular networks are cheaper than landlines overseas.
5015288	5015568	Yeah.
5016269	5021418	So it ended up becoming a much better market to develop as opposed to people here.
5021538	5023361	I still like my rotary phone.
5025665	5026547	I like the noises.
5027188	5028390	I do like my rotary phone.
5030607	5036911	It's not as good as having to actually call the operator and ask to be put through to Mrs. Cleaver.
5037011	5047057	Although, you know, if people go to Geek Life and click the link for ThinkGeek, you can buy a handset for your iPhone.
5048338	5051379	A rotary phone style handset for your iPhone.
5051419	5053319	You can also buy bacon mints on ThinkGeek.
5053639	5054139	Yes, you can.
5055400	5055700	Anyhow.
5056240	5058480	But follow the link.
5058681	5064262	Anyway, but back to... Are we going to get a kickback for that little plug you just said?
5064562	5064902	Maybe.
5066022	5066302	All right.
5066482	5068963	But back to the point, I mean...
5070555	5098159	it really has to do also with how far society itself is willing to advance because keep in mind I'm going to use an old comparison here Betamax and VHS if you look at the two side by side Betamax was the better format you had a better picture quality but it went to VHS because of funding because that's what got the push it's that way with any technology it depends on what's got the backing behind it
5098839	5120625	where you're say that you live in Japan and it's better to have a cell phone service you know then obviously that's where the money is that's where people are going to push the technology but here for the longest time it was all landlines you know cell phones were novel you had that big brick in your car you know but now it's kind of turning around like you know Dan and I don't have a landline
5120785	5123226	God, I remember my parents' first cell phone.
5123266	5126028	Like that fucker mounted in the middle of the car.
5126328	5128369	It was this giant handset you actually picked up.
5128389	5130049	It looked like it was connected to a car battery.
5130069	5131590	It looked like it caused cancer.
5132711	5140054	No, we went to a trip coming back from Washington one time when Dan's dad had his wedding.
5140614	5141935	Right soon after I moved out here.
5142395	5145397	So we're talking about, you know, late 90s.
5146577	5149279	And it looked like a phone attached to a car battery.
5150319	5150839	You know what I mean?
5151240	5152160	Yeah, I really do.
5152240	5153421	Okay, who's seen Kill Bill?
5154581	5157703	And the phone that Sophie pops out in the flashback scene?
5158563	5160444	You know, that's what cell phones look like.
5160564	5163225	Yeah, yeah.
5164786	5170249	But my point is that it really depends on what market the money is going to be in.
5172150	5176512	God, I met a kid the other day, didn't know what a VHS tape was.
5179924	5182046	I think part of it was just trolling.
5196616	5198037	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5223974	5224955	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5239071	5243716	I would think even I am challenged to sit down, like imagine if I had to sit down and write a letter in cursive.
5244337	5249742	Like that would actually like take a minute to kind of like, okay, it'd be like some of the capital letters you don't write every day.
5250603	5258151	Actually, I take a lot of written notes, but I print, you know, but like if I had to write cursive, I don't really practice that.
5258422	5259664	I actually do practice my cursive.
5273826	5275867	She would make me sit down and practice my handwriting.
5276347	5277147	So to this day.
5277608	5289812	And then when I went and took typography, and we had to, basically what he had us do is start off with glyphs and then find out once our glyphs got to be a little bit more, just free drawing little glyphs.
5290253	5293854	And once they got to be more complex, then we said, okay, what letter does that look like?
5293894	5295655	And we'd practice full letter forms.
5295675	5295875	Mm-hmm.
5296355	5298116	and then pick that and go from there.
5298176	5305279	So it was talking about how written language evolved just from reflex in your hands.
5307160	5317084	My printed handwriting only got better when I started my job as a corporate trainer because I have to write on the whiteboard all the time and it's actually kind of embarrassing that my handwriting sucks.
5317625	5321967	And I know I'll be writing stuff on the board and I'm like, oh God, it looks like a seven-year-old is teaching this class.
5322247	5322567	Practice.
5323587	5327049	Yeah, well, you know, and I've been doing my job long enough now where it's gotten a lot better.
5327789	5333311	But, I mean, that's the whole point is that those handwriting skills aren't being focused on that much anymore.
5333531	5336613	So people are forgetting what should be a basic skill.
5337473	5340194	I mean, a lot of people are actually even forgetting the origins of their language.
5340214	5346357	Like, I posted something from Crack Today about words showing up in the dictionary, like girl, like the G-R-R-R-L.
5347077	5347477	Oh, right.
5347977	5350098	And I'm like, those aren't real words.
5350158	5351219	Those don't need to be there.
5351259	5351779	That's slang.
5352779	5362082	The one reason I would want to be an English teacher is to say if you use any text speak in a written paper, you automatically fail this entire class.
5362162	5364103	My second grade teacher was mean.
5364483	5371026	I'm not talking about... Okay, she was pregnant and then had her baby, so I think part of it might have been... Now that I'm an adult, it might have been postpartum.
5371746	5377388	But the first half of the semester, we had the sweetest lady as the substitute, and then the rest of the year is Miss Bitch Game.
5378248	5380850	Her name was Miss... I'm not going to say it.
5381150	5382891	I still remember her name.
5383571	5388034	But she used to just walk by and smack our hands every time we started doing a letter form wrong.
5388794	5391496	It's like, no, you're going to sit and you're going to start from the beginning and rewrite the whole thing.
5394298	5398160	But I think people are relying too much on their cell phones also to correct their spelling.
5399621	5406165	How much more often do you see people doing T-H-E-R-E when they mean a possessive there?
5408582	5409062	Oh, right.
5409582	5411883	I think people are relying too much on their autocorrect.
5412183	5425446	And it goes back to that same thing when I brought up Japan with people forgetting how to write, you know... I was even reading an article the other day about how a lot of the original kanji is actually now brought out in more simplified forms.
5425886	5427166	And people are forgetting how to write the old way.
5427947	5428367	But it's...
5430468	5436299	I think that having our computers and everything do this for us is making us all lazier as people.
5437621	5443191	And people are forgetting something that should just be something that you learn in first grade.
5443430	5444590	All right, OLR listeners.
5444690	5448252	Now, if you think maybe your handwriting can use some improvement, here's a chance.
5448312	5459035	Get a pen and paper, which might be a chore all in itself, but find a pen and paper and write down, the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog five times every day.
5459335	5461416	The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
5461876	5463116	DarkSakura, you're a design person.
5463136	5464897	You know why that, why is that sentence important?
5464957	5467038	Because it has every word in the alphabet, every letter in the alphabet.
5467238	5467838	Good job.
5468410	5471471	That's also why it's used for typeface samples.
5471491	5475312	But there's a few other sentences that have everyone.
5475332	5475953	I just can't remember.
5476033	5476873	But there's a few other.
5478193	5483035	Emma Gray, which is one of the type foundries that I follow, has different sample sheets out.
5483055	5484475	That whole like lorem ipsum.
5485076	5485976	No, not the lorem ipsum.
5486076	5488957	Different sentences that have the same, have the letters in them.
5490109	5493192	See, I'm trying to integrate the geeky design stuff into the show for you.
5493472	5493913	Thank you.
5493933	5494733	It makes me happy.
5494994	5496295	I'm throwing you a bone.
5496455	5500018	I had a squee, which is why I was showing you someone throwing up rainbows on somebody else.
5500739	5501900	I'll find the picture for the chat room.
5501920	5502160	All right.
5502180	5503681	Well, speaking of throwing up rainbows.
5505990	5507231	Here's some happy music for you.
5507531	5510873	They can always tell you that the classic game of the week is on its way.
5511333	5517516	Every week DarkSakura goes to the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks you ungrateful children should be checking out.
5517536	5520378	Especially if you've never had VHS in your life.
5521458	5523239	You probably have missed a lot of these games.
5523400	5524700	I had a Betamax player.
5524921	5526101	I had a Betamax player, too.
5526121	5527062	Sit down.
5527582	5528923	I had Clue on Betamax.
5528983	5529464	Sit down.
5529484	5535027	I had an 8-track player with a record player attached to it and transistor keys.
5535047	5536248	Hold up to the classic game of the week.
5536488	5544554	I had the record player that was built into the... Well, my family had the record player that was built into the shelf because the shelf was the speaker.
5544594	5545294	It was so big.
5545834	5548356	And we had Star Wars soundtrack on vinyl.
5548416	5550978	And I wish I still had that today because that thing's probably worth a shit ton of money.
5551238	5551738	Turn the page, bleep!
5575589	5577969	Oh yeah, well, I had a gramophone.
5577989	5580630	I had to fucking crank that shit if I wanted something to play.
5582510	5583610	My husband's laughing in the other room.
5584451	5586251	Actually, I'll tell you one thing that I did have.
5586271	5590252	I had an entire set of Voltron books on cassette.
5590792	5593532	BlackWolfInChat says, I had reel-to-reel biatches.
5593832	5597533	Dude, when I studied communication design in college, we had to learn.
5597633	5602634	Like, this is just, this is honestly, should I say this on the radio?
5602654	5602974	Say it.
5604281	5604521	I know.
5604541	5604581	No.
5626621	5627402	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5646633	5662136	with fucking tape and a wax pen where you listen to the thing and then you have to do the wax pen to cut out the words and all this stuff and guess how much I've used a wax tape in producing nine years that lasts longer than most radio shows do on commercial radio.
5662416	5666237	Guess how many times I've used a wax pen in the nine years of doing this show.
5666697	5667377	Zero.
5669917	5672638	Because the state school is not on the cutting edge technology.
5675180	5701592	but you could get drinks really cheap I can say this though the design program at Sac State is actually really top notch and some of the people are hiring directly from Sac State now well I'm sure things have changed and so forth but I'm just saying some people learn best from just being thrown in the pool and told you better fucking swim to me well there's a book I'm reading right now which by the way the review should be on Geek Life in a few days and I know it's ironic that I'm a teacher now but I'm a corporate trainer there's a big difference
5703292	5709855	But the book I'm reading is an autobiography of a big name in comics, and again, everyone will find out who it is.
5710195	5718438	But it's talking about how he broke into illustration and comics just by drawing all the time and then being hired because of his talent, because of his skill.
5719258	5729902	And learning how to do newspaper editing and airbrushing in the 30s by being said, here's your airbrush, these are your inks.
5732229	5736892	Anyway, I realize my opinion is a little bit controversial, but I just speak from real life experience.
5736912	5737753	I agree with you.
5738673	5748519	I realize some people out there may not and may even possibly be offended, but I'm just saying from my experience in my world, college did nothing for me, but fuck me up emotionally.
5749814	5758244	Like with the classes I've gone to, I know how to use the programs already, but I listen to my teachers who have been working in the field because I want their experience.
5758524	5762769	It's a better thing when you have a teacher that gives you real life experience because they're in it.
5762789	5763350	They're doing it.
5764051	5767255	As opposed to, oh, I got my master's and now I'm going to teach.
5768601	5769041	You know what I mean?
5769581	5770342	You can tell the difference.
5771222	5772502	But yeah, I'm sorry.
5772822	5773222	Anyhow.
5773823	5774523	Oh, you know what else I had?
5774543	5779464	I had all of the Gremlins records that they gave out at McDonald's with the Happy Meal.
5779584	5787847	I had the record that came free in the newspaper that sang the song about the big Mac McDLT, a quarter pounder with some cheese.
5787867	5789527	How do I remember that song?
5789728	5791028	I remember that fucking song!
5791408	5792089	I had the Fruit Loops one.
5792109	5793069	I'm a corporate whore.
5793550	5794691	Rob, I had the Fruit Loops one.
5794811	5798153	The one that came in on a Square album in a box of Fruit Loops.
5798373	5799875	It's like a fucking plastic record.
5799995	5800255	I know.
5802977	5803197	Okay.
5803658	5805819	I love how we went from throwing up rainbows.
5806440	5811003	You know you're old school when you've had a warped record and you fixed it yourself.
5813005	5819310	You know you're old school when you know that the best version of Alice in Wonderland they ever made was that TV movie in the 80s with Carol Channing.
5819330	5819350	I
5822168	5823051	Back to rainbows.
5827361	5828661	How about some classic games?
5830042	5834042	Well this, I'm taking us all the way back to 1996.
5835343	5836783	That was before I moved out here.
5837243	5842384	And I must thank my husband for turning me on to this series even though I did work for Namco for a little while.
5843064	5848185	But I didn't really give it much thought until my husband said, this game's awesome, we're gonna play it.
5848765	5850725	And it is Soul Edge.
5851545	5852465	Woo!
5852706	5853846	Soul Edge.
5854506	5855226	You got soul.
5856909	5861114	So, um, this is the intro, so we have to play a little bit of the intro.
5864839	5872348	Transcending history and the world, a tale of soul and swords, eternally retold.
5884889	5889171	Anyway, this game had... We've actually got this soundtrack.
5889251	5889792	It's so cool.
5890112	5894033	But anyway, this is from the PlayStation version, Soul Blade.
5894514	5898475	Anyway, Soul Edge is a 3D fighting game.
5898515	5903277	It was the second one that had characters with weapons, the first being Toshinden.
5904158	5910880	And this actually had... You know, everyone had their different style depending on their actual weapon.
5911741	5911821	Um...
5914045	5915387	Soul Edge Version 2 Soul Edge Version 2
5930705	5934708	Huang was put into that version as well.
5935148	5939031	He was actually originally a palette swap of Mitsurugi in the Korean version.
5939671	5945216	And you could play as Cervantes, who is the pirate who had the soul edge, the sword.
5946276	5952221	And they also put in air combos and guard impacts and everyone had upgraded moves.
5952941	5955643	It came out, like I said, on the PlayStation as Soul Blade.
5956824	5956984	And...
5959927	5961888	It was... Oh, you're playing... That's Cervantes' music.
5961988	5962689	I love that song.
5962749	5963329	It's so cool.
5963790	5967372	But anyway, everyone had their own little... Hold on.
5967412	5969753	Let me let the listeners have a peek at this music real quick.
5969773	5972335	Because I will say one thing I love... Start from the beginning.
5972435	5975157	One thing I love about these games is the soundtracks.
5975217	5977318	I mean, they're just flippin' amazing.
5977358	5977719	Here we go.
5977739	5978159	A little clip.
5996830	6001013	But, yes, that's actually, I think, my favorite piece in that game.
6001033	6004075	That's the arranged version, by the way, from the PlayStation version.
6004855	6009078	Because the PlayStation versions had arranged soundtracks, as well as the original soundtracks.
6010219	6010459	Nice.
6013241	6019865	At any rate, basically, you could move your character all along their little...
6022506	6028052	Stage area, and you had borders around the stage, so if you fell off of your little stage, then that was, you know, you'd die.
6028092	6029654	It's kind of hard, though, to jump off the stage.
6031576	6038483	Your jump was actually kind of, not really so much of a jump, but some characters had better jumps.
6039644	6044986	Um, there was also a weapon gauge, and it had your weapon's resistance on it.
6046006	6049167	And, um, when you would block an attack, your bar would deplete.
6049287	6051808	And if it emptied, you would lose your weapon.
6052729	6054409	And then you'd have to finish the match unarmed.
6055389	6057730	So, uh, basically, like, oops, my sword broke.
6057990	6058430	Oh, crap.
6059491	6059931	And, uh...
6061678	6068703	There were also locking moves too, so you'd have to press the button at the right time and see who could get out of it.
6070044	6075227	Everyone had one or two unblockable attacks, which actually came from the Tekken series.
6076248	6080571	And it was really hard to pull them off, so that kept it pretty balanced.
6080691	6086835	And then you had critical edge attacks that were like a long series of different links.
6086895	6090057	Kind of like, have you ever played in Tekken when you used King's Throws?
6090137	6090938	It's kind of the same deal.
6092038	6100345	Um, but then, um, there were different combinations of different attacks that would, you know, have a special sequence.
6101225	6105468	So, uh, on top of that, it would also deplete a third of the weapons gauge when you use it.
6105508	6106889	It was the ABK attacks.
6107830	6114295	It had an aggressive block, which is called Guard Impact, that would, uh, give you a free counterattack.
6115015	6117617	And then you also had, like I said earlier, a ring out.
6117918	6120279	You can't just jump out of the ring, you have to be thrown out of the ring.
6122500	6132104	The game itself, according to Namco, took place in 1584, and it's warriors searching for the Soul Edge.
6132404	6135425	It had different names, but it was pretty nasty.
6136065	6138286	Anytime someone had it, bad crap happened.
6139146	6141607	So it had all kinds of different characters.
6141627	6145168	You had Siegfried, you had Mitsurugi, who was your samurai.
6145188	6146869	You had Taki, who was your ninja girl.
6147569	6148150	Voldo!
6148530	6149372	Oh, Voldo.
6150092	6151534	He was Mr. Bondage Boy.
6153296	6157882	His weapon was a katar, the hand-mounted blade.
6158843	6163209	And he wore lots of strappy leather, I'm sure some of us recall.
6164991	6165912	And then there was...
6169333	6170475	Song Mina, Seung Ha Myung
6185674	6193602	And it kept all the Soul Edge version 2 and 5 unlockable characters, including the Soul Edge, the boss of the game.
6194522	6199086	And it had Arcade Mode, Versus Mode, Survival, Team Battle, Time Attack, and Training.
6199367	6205172	It had an RPG mode called Edge Master Mode, so you could basically go through a story.
6205192	6208175	It had it like they were a character in a book, so it was kind of neat.
6209155	6233186	and you had extra versions of different weapons that had more power or more strength or durability and like I said also you had an arranged soundtrack and the arcade soundtrack and then you had the con super session which that's the album that we have is the con super session that is this band their stuff is really really good stuff
6235715	6241583	So it is probably one of the best fighting games ever, I think.
6242085	6243926	I think a lot of people have a lot of love for this game.
6244487	6253573	Admittedly, I didn't get into this series until Soul Calibur 2, the arcade version, which still is one of my favorite GameCube games they ever made.
6253813	6257195	That's actually from this intro that we're listening to music off of.
6257215	6258456	It's off the Japanese intro.
6259317	6262959	Because they had to put clothes on Sofatia.
6263719	6267662	In the scene where she's in the water and Hephaestus is coming out of the water to talk to her.
6268062	6269543	She's naked in the Japanese version.
6269563	6271345	They had to put clothes on her in the American one.
6272285	6273525	Thank you for watching!

6309298	6310058	We'll be back after this.
6316411	6318952	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6318992	6328076	We are live here on this July 10th, 2011 with episode number 419 of our show, which you know means next week is episode 420.
6328537	6330918	Not that, you know, any of us are...
6331678	6332958	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6360988	6365275	and Understation Live, the show where I started on internet radio.
6366880	6367380	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6392677	6399963	And it occurred to me, I don't know if you saw my reply to a post on our private guilds forums, but that night I was so mad.
6400463	6405147	I think you said something to me, DarkSakura, and I was like, this game can suck my fucking dick, good night.
6405307	6407849	And I was like, it didn't occur to me until like two days later.
6407869	6410471	I was like, oh God, did she think I said that to her?
6410491	6411752	Because I wasn't saying that to her.
6412132	6416656	You said some acronym that I didn't understand at the time.
6417376	6421119	And then afterwards I was like, oh, that's what it is.
6421239	6423961	Because you said VTK'd.
6424441	6426803	And I was like... Oh, vote kicked.
6426843	6427143	Yes.
6427424	6427904	Vote kicked.
6427924	6429165	They VTK'd me.
6429185	6429865	Yeah, VTK'd me.
6429905	6430166	Whatever.
6430506	6434209	But I was like... My reply I remember was, what?
6434389	6435650	And he's like, this game can suck my dick.
6435690	6436190	I'm going, bye.
6437311	6440033	And I'm sitting there just staring at my computer going...
6442065	6443506	Who's gonna play with me now?
6444647	6447370	I had a diva moment where I stormed off the set.
6447750	6449772	Seriously, that's exactly what it was like.
6450112	6452234	And I like, I seriously, I sat there for 10 minutes.
6452334	6456238	I had time for my character to go on away and sit down and pout.
6457979	6460501	But I mean, I was like, I was trying to figure out what's going on.
6460541	6461662	So I started looking it up online.
6462223	6466727	I was emotionally raped by a guild on another server with that vote.
6466747	6468809	Do the troll dungeons link to other servers?
6469614	6470474	Oh yeah, they all do.
6470574	6471475	I didn't know about that.
6471595	6472995	Oh yeah, they all do.
6473615	6474376	So be careful.
6474676	6475816	Yeah, Loki, you were going to ask a question.
6476036	6491961	Oh no, I was just going to say, speaking of voting the kick up, prior to the mods being patched on the Grand Theft Auto, when we were playing just regular private matches, my coworkers would usually try to vote to kick me out of the game because I'd be kicking the crap out of them.
6492201	6494162	I was like, vote him out, he's being...
6496028	6498930	That's ignorant that somebody would vote kick just because they're good.
6500952	6501753	They think it's funny.
6501793	6506458	That's what I keep telling myself is that this guild couldn't just handle my beauty so that's why they had to vote kick me.
6506738	6511783	Anyway, more information on that at HordeHouse.com We told you about the stupid bitch we had.
6512742	6513182	Thanks for watching!
6534384	6535504	I just want to run through this really fast.
6535524	6536445	I don't care about anybody else.
6536465	6537366	We can only do the last one.
6537446	6539227	And then she starts getting really foul.
6539467	6543430	And then she's like saying, let's vote to kick the tank.
6543470	6544831	And I'm like, bitch, no.
6544851	6549994	I was like, do you read that all of us are in the same guild and you're not?
6551335	6553057	See, you should have vote kicked her.
6553437	6553837	I started.
6553977	6554197	I did.
6554698	6556239	I requested a vote kicker three times.
6557109	6557810	And it didn't pass.
6558371	6559392	It did on the third time.
6560373	6561974	Because it did that delay thing.
6562795	6564056	I was not a rude cunt.
6564537	6566339	No, you're nice.
6567680	6568541	I've got screen capture.
6568561	6569161	She was that bad.
6571564	6573105	Okay, I'm going to tell you something, everybody.
6573145	6576188	And it doesn't matter if you're on World of Warcraft or whatever MMO that you're on.
6577129	6578130	Be nice.
6579091	6585836	You don't get anything from being a bitch or, you know, blaming everything on the tank.
6585916	6586677	Or a troll.
6587037	6593502	I mean, there's so many, so many trolls in WoW, and it's really like, what do you really get?
6593622	6595344	Like, this is masturbation for you.
6595704	6601108	I can't think of anything else that, like, trolling accomplishes other than, like, jacking yourself off.
6601248	6602910	Well, I'm going to give a few pieces of advice.
6602930	6603030	Huh.
6603610	6604271	DarkSakura.com
6614892	6618733	Well, that's rule number one of the OL Army, which I know we don't talk about that a lot.
6618773	6620374	But, you know, we do have a Steam group.
6620714	6623395	We do have several gaming groups available online.
6623455	6629356	You know, with all the Steam sale orgy stuff going on right now, if you're not in the OL Army group, I don't know what you're doing.
6629376	6632577	Because the rule number one of the OL Army is don't be a dick.
6633418	6635258	And so, you know, you should come join us on Steam.
6635298	6638579	And more information is at OrangeLingerie.com in that little extend play box on the left side.
6639079	6641620	Well, number two refers to how you treat your tank.
6643320	6644441	It's a three strike rule.
6645161	6653585	Number one, if your tank doesn't flat out say, I've never tanked this before and they're doing a bad job, stop and explain the mechanic to them if you happen to know it.
6654606	6660749	If they still act shitty, give them one more try and if they are just derpy, say, sorry, we need you to leave.
6661109	6663710	That really doesn't just apply to tanks.
6664070	6666312	I think that can go for anybody in any MMO.
6666352	6667032	It doesn't even have to be WoW.
6667092	6667252	I mean,
6667432	6668493	And sometimes people make mistakes.
6668513	6671735	Like, I've started using, you know, when you hit V and the little life bar show up.
6672315	6680039	I accidentally targeted a creature in a group over because the little name tag was, like, right next to the one I was targeting.
6680460	6684862	And so I made a boo-boo, but I, you know, went and resheaped everybody and everyone was happy.
6685663	6686863	But it's just like...
6688567	6689908	Don't point fingers.
6690388	6691089	Don't lay blame.
6691169	6695051	If someone is truly bad, a good party will hold them through it.
6695172	6700355	If they are being bad on purpose, then say, sorry, you need to practice this one a little bit more.
6700415	6702997	Play with your guildies for a bit.
6704398	6706739	I will not be in a party unless there's one other guildie with me.
6707160	6707660	I just won't do it.
6708600	6713504	I did it once, though, on my first troll heroic.
6713564	6714124	My third rule.
6714745	6718187	If you are not on your game, you need to step back.
6719288	6719888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6740279	6754255	or if I'm having a bad night I'll say you know what I'm just not into this I'm going to have to back out because I'm holding everyone back you need to be able to say to take enough responsibility on yourself that you're not going to ruin somebody else's good time so those are
6755436	6782749	My three rules for playing with other people Words of sage wisdom from an OMG real life girl Yes Alright Speaking of MMOs I can't remember if I told this story last week So stop me if I'm repeating myself I'm getting old and I forget an old age But Salacious Pop did a really big troll on me Because of the Steam sale that's going on I was mentioning just offhand something about I wonder what Final Fantasy XI is like these days And you know, gosh I'd be really curious what's going on in XI these days
6783249	6784331	So I open up Steam.
6785012	6791761	You have been gifted a copy of Final Fantasy XI, the complete Uber edition, including the new Abyssia expansion.
6793003	6794145	It's 11 bucks.
6794325	6797149	I look over at Alan and I go, you're such a fucking troll.
6800160	6802422	So that is actually downloading at home right now.
6802522	6805684	Not that I'm going to log in and play right away, but yeah.
6805844	6808346	I do have 30 days of that that I can check out at some point.
6808366	6809427	Oh, mine finally finished.
6809487	6810868	I downloaded Champions.
6811128	6812529	Oh, I was like, did you download XI?
6812589	6812909	No way.
6812969	6814851	Oh, you downloaded Champions, the free, yeah.
6814871	6815131	You know what?
6816492	6820054	If someone gave me $11 so I could get Final Fantasy XI, Rob, I would play with you.
6821495	6823056	Just to see how lulzy it is now.
6823076	6823637	Mm-hmm.
6825083	6825924	But somebody has to give you $11.
6826704	6827304	Good luck on that.
6827384	6828505	Or just send it to me on Steam.
6829886	6830886	It's so easy now.
6831767	6832067	All right.
6833688	6835629	Dan's in the other room saying, no more momos.
6836390	6837310	No more momos.
6837350	6838971	But it's only 30 days, Dan.
6841277	6844179	That's... He's yelling.
6844199	6845920	That's how Warcraft started.
6846101	6847181	And he goes, fucking Rob.
6847201	6848742	Yeah, I know, I know.
6849103	6850364	All right, let's move on.
6850904	6857109	We need to do some rapid-fire news and talk about some other stuff going on in the gaming world.
6857829	6858109	Loki.
6858610	6865995	Yeah, speaking of Final Fantasy, there's a Final Fantasy game coming to the 3DS, although this may not be the Final Fantasy game you're looking for.
6866355	6867696	It's Final Fantasy...
6870325	6871585	Now Cloud can dance like never before.
6895630	6900574	Funny that you should mention Cloud because actually I think I see someone in that picture that looks very similar to a TV Cloud.
6900594	6907519	I'm just imagining Busta Moves songs in my head with the characters replaced with Cloud and it's really funny to me.
6907539	6908279	I don't know why.
6908760	6909520	It looks kind of neat.
6909841	6910561	I like rhythm games.
6910621	6913723	I like Final Fantasy so maybe I'd check it out.
6913743	6920048	For people looking for a Final Fantasy RPG that's brand new and everything, not quite what you're looking for here.
6921129	6921929	But I'd check it out.
6921949	6922550	It looks kind of neat.
6923570	6925431	It's like two fanboy worlds colliding.
6926172	6926972	Pretty much, yeah.
6927372	6934656	And then, on top of that, Harmonix is, of course, working on a new IP called VidRhythm, and that's literally all we know about that.
6936157	6941600	They've just confirmed, yeah, there's something that we can add to it at this time, but yes, we are working on that project.
6942160	6944982	So maybe a new Rez-type game or something like that.
6945962	6946402	Maybe, Kenny.
6946823	6947043	We'll see.
6948123	6972038	and then finally this is kind of neat Rockstar is trademarked Rockstar Films and apparently people are thinking hey you know what they did mention one time that if someone was going to make Grand Theft Auto into a movie that it would be them they said that they would be the ones that would want to handle that
6973839	6976221	So maybe we'll see some movies coming from them.
6976301	6978942	Actually, I could see something like L.A.
6979243	6984786	Noire or something like that as a movie from them because it's a little bit more of a linear story.
6985246	6987088	Grand Theft Auto would be a little bit kind of crazy.
6987208	6993552	I don't know if they could do that, but neat that they'd be turning some of their games into movies.
6994933	6995113	Neat!
6996880	7000703	Which would you rather have first, a Grand Theft Auto movie or a Red Dead Redemption movie?
7000863	7003085	Because I would think Red Dead Redemption would make a better movie.
7003485	7004146	Maybe that's just me.
7005107	7005507	Of course.
7006568	7014454	You know, I never realized you have a thing, because usually I beat you here to the show, so I don't see your car pull up a whole lot, but tonight I was late thanks to an accident.
7014854	7020158	So I pull up behind you, and I never realized you had a license plate frame that said, I'd rather be playing Grand Theft Auto.
7020479	7022200	Yes, I got that a few months back.
7022220	7023301	That's nice.
7024400	7026621	All right, some other quick news here.
7027101	7031022	An interesting spinoff of the Burnout series that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
7031422	7033843	Burnout Crash, apparently, is coming out.
7033943	7035444	By interesting, you mean terrible.
7036664	7040225	The thing that's interesting about it to me is it's that whole top-down look.
7040605	7042566	It looks like... Remember...
7044213	7046815	Ivan, Iron Man, Stewart, Super Offroad
7063726	7068948	Now granted, I didn't look at the trailer, so let me look at the trailer, because maybe it is kind of poopy if I see it in motion.
7069748	7071688	They have two different trailers.
7073449	7075350	No, I do not like the look of freshly colored hair.
7075390	7076050	You shut your mouth.
7076590	7081512	See, that's the thing about Joystick, is they always have commercials for hair products for women.
7082272	7084352	That is such a wrong demographic.
7084412	7087914	I can't wait until I see a douche commercial come up on one of these trailers.
7087954	7089194	That and like, you know, hey...
7089654	7096640	your children are visiting the internet you should use AOL's blah blah blah to lock down the internet do you have rampant vaginitis?
7098962	7113936	I don't know if this trailer is going to show gameplay because they had a teaser one that didn't have any gameplay in it but the gameplay trailer or little preview not good let me do the YouTube thing instead of trying to go to a gaming news website I'll just go direct to YouTube
7115425	7132872	um but anyways if crash time it's basically you know the crash mode that they had in the other games which hey you know what if they wanted to bring that over into its own game and make it look like the regular burnout games but just be all the crash mode i'd be fine with that so
7135387	7136889	This is an Xbox Live arcade game, right?
7137389	7138190	This is fun!
7138430	7139512	It also supports Kinect.
7139672	7142295	Notice the hopping up and down icon right there.
7142615	7145298	Yes, in order to make cars explode, you have to hop up and down.
7145758	7147740	I can turn that bullshit off, right?
7148021	7148762	Oh, fuck it.
7148782	7149562	I won't play with that on.
7150143	7151144	Blow up the pizza truck.
7151505	7154528	This looks like Super Sprint mixed with Burnout.
7154648	7156170	I think this is actually kind of rad looking.
7160350	7161850	Of course, there's not a lot going on right now.
7161870	7164631	I guess it would be better if they were actually driving faster or something.
7164931	7165611	It's got fire.
7165871	7167771	Instead of just causing a 20-car pileup.
7167791	7168431	Well, that's the point.
7168751	7175073	See, the car pileups or whatever and destruction, it causes your little meter to build up and then you can explode your car.
7175213	7178193	Oh, that's like, there was a mode like that in one of the older Burnout games.
7178213	7179293	Yeah, crash mode.
7179313	7180914	That's what this is based off of.
7181274	7185174	But that's the thing, though, is I really wish it was in that format and not necessarily this.
7185534	7189095	Because the Kinect functionality, they have it where you drive the car, like you make
7189715	7193898	10 and 2, Steering Wheel Motions or whatever, and then you have the hop up and down to make your car slow.
7193918	7194538	Which I hate.
7194618	7195839	I played that racing game.
7196679	7197299	It's terrible.
7197800	7197960	Yeah.
7198260	7198800	I just don't like it.
7199140	7205064	Anyhow, one game I do like is Torchlight, and Runic Games announced that Torchlight surpassed a million units sold.
7205584	7207325	This would be across the PC, the Mac, and the 360.
7207385	7214229	They haven't said how much on what system, but considering it's been discounted on Steam several times, I'm pretty sure that helped.
7214669	7218211	Just like it helped sell Lady Gaga a million albums when Amazon sold it for 99 cents.
7219011	7223852	Anyhow, Runic is right now working on Torchlight 2.
7224172	7231454	They are still targeting 2011 for the launch, but they won't announce a release date until Runic is closer to being done.
7231974	7239716	You can tell that the employees were from Blizzard, a big chunk of them, because Blizzard does that same damn thing where it's like, it will come out when it's ready.
7241069	7262087	Kojima, Hideo Kojima, of course, known for the Metal Gear series, but also known for a series that was popular in Japan, Snatcher, which kind of has a cult following here, announced on the latest edition of his Hideo Radio podcast, apparently he is going back to something he had announced several years ago, but nothing ever came of it.
7262387	7267651	He's basically re-announced that a radio drama inspired by the 1998 cyberpunk game Snatcher
7269833	7273755	that's been scripted by Suda51 called S.D.
7273895	7274255	Atcher.
7274736	7277337	It's kind of a spin on Suda51's name.
7278077	7280899	This is the Team Up Project S thing.
7281459	7282820	It's a radio drama.
7282960	7290423	It will be released to coincide with the 300th episode of Hiday Radio, and Akira Yamaoka is going to be doing the music.
7290904	7296166	So judging by the fact that they're on episode 296 now, you'll be able to find this episode 300.
7296206	7299348	They come out biweekly, so 300 will be in about, what,
7299827	7300187	DarkSakura
7311724	7317548	Well, in other news, we do have some costumes for LittleBigPlanet 2, the Final Fantasy 7 pack.
7318749	7327556	There's going to be, from what I can see on here, we have Aerith, who cares, Tifa, we have Vincent, yay, Cloud, and Sephiroth.
7327636	7330138	Well, if you have Aerith, you can just jump her off a cliff over and over.
7330638	7333360	No, if you've got Aerith, you just have to stab her over and over.
7333561	7335742	Or just hold the square and watch her head explode.
7335762	7339285	Because remember, in LittleBigPlanet 2, you can explode your little guy.
7339305	7339385	Okay.
7339835	7342257	That, okay, that makes it worth it.
7342717	7344719	The Sephiroth one's kind of funny looking for the record.
7345640	7352845	And then, now I actually saw the trailer for this in the theater for Tekken Blood Vengeance.
7354006	7356248	And I was like, this looks really cool, I'm gonna see that.
7358590	7360853	It is a one-night-only U.S.
7360913	7364516	showing that's going to be before the Japanese release by a little over a month.
7365497	7374006	And it has 20 minutes of interviews with the tech and staff, including the screenwriter Dai Sato.
7374046	7375528	He also was behind Cowboy Bebop.
7375848	7381011	Is this going to be one of those horrible live events at the theater things that you always see the commercials for?
7381431	7387295	Like the whole, like, see Coldplay take the stage at Madison Square Garden at your local theater.
7387375	7389156	It is like one of those.
7390097	7390257	No.
7390797	7391758	You get to see the movie.
7392418	7396120	No, no, I know, I know, but don't you ever see the commercials of the movies for these things?
7396140	7396960	Well, yeah.
7396980	7398261	Well, those are Fathom Events things.
7398581	7399582	That, Fathom Events.
7399662	7401843	A night at the Metropolitan.
7401863	7407966	And they are going to be doing, it is the same thing, because they do this, it's very limited theaters that they do it in.
7408666	7415010	Because they've done other anime things, like they did the Death Note movie, and the live action Death Note movie, and stuff like that.
7416330	7417391	Rob, we went to see Escaflowne.
7418621	7443546	I didn't go to that I thought you went with us to see Ascophonians I know, I remember a bunch of people went to that San Francisco Nope, never seen it They'll probably do this with the Trigon movie when it comes out I've seen a bunch of movies I saw Perfect Blue in the theater You went to see Perfect Blue with me, that was it No, I haven't seen that either I don't think, there's not a lot of animes I've seen in the theater I saw Howl's Moving Castle You've seen Requiem for a Dream, haven't you?
7443986	7444066	No
7445164	7446604	That's like Salacious Pop's favorite movie.
7446925	7450505	Yeah, but the guy was a fan of the director of Perfect Blue.
7453346	7454687	He actually fully ripped a scene from it.
7454987	7460568	By the way, there's totally a new Studio Ghibli film coming out in a couple weeks in Japan.
7460588	7461088	I had no idea.
7461728	7465049	There's actually one that just came out already out there, but I want to come out here really desperately.
7465569	7471771	It's called Kurigurashi no Ariete, which is the borrower Ariete from the books The Borrowers.
7472759	7473600	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7489660	7492340	I'm going to see the movie.
7492380	7493501	I really want to see the movie.
7493881	7495661	Because I am a huge Tekken fangirl.
7495681	7496362	But it's all CG.
7497262	7498302	So it's going to be really cool.
7498722	7500363	And it's going to be on July 26th.
7501343	7506965	And then it will be six hours of gorgeous Tekken gooey mess.
7507105	7507505	You know what?
7507545	7514927	For OLR's 10th anniversary show, I think we should hook up with Fathom Events and make it a one night in the theater special.
7515127	7518288	And DarkSakura will just have to deal with being on the big screen for a night.
7518308	7521708	I don't know how expensive that is, but I know that they do that for Riff Trax.
7521788	7523109	Do they?
7524009	7526710	It's expensive, but I think it's moderately expensive.
7526770	7533851	Okay, OLR Army, call your local theater and demand the OLR 10th anniversary special to come to Fathom Events.
7533931	7535072	I'll have a mask made.
7535532	7536532	That would be weird.
7538234	7538714	I don't know.
7539735	7541456	Yeah, we're packing theaters, all right.
7542156	7554382	Well, now that we've sat you down and you've paid $10 to come see our big mugs in your local movie theater, we thought, what should we do that's special for this 10th year anniversary show?
7554402	7555702	Barrett Vision 3D.
7555762	7561145	So we're going to have Extifer bleach his asshole live right in front of you on the camera.
7561165	7562346	We'll have an X rating.
7563246	7565730	It'll be rated X for extifers, bitched asshole.
7565750	7569134	It'll be like the time that Katie Couric got her colonoscopy on the Today Show.
7569194	7569495	Come on.
7570907	7577051	Anyway, in other news, Resident Evil HD versions are going to be coming out on Xbox.
7577351	7578171	On Xbox 360.
7578672	7581913	We will have Code Veronica X and Resident Evil 4.
7582774	7584975	And they will have 1,000 achievement points.
7585796	7587277	Ooh.
7587597	7589538	So, yay.
7590138	7594481	But it's going to have... Here's some of the achievements for Code Veronica.
7594501	7596762	There's The Terror Begins, Escape from the Graveyard of Terror.
7597442	7601627	A Change Father, Liberate the Changed Man, um, there's ones for encountering former S.T.A.R.S.
7601667	7603749	captains, so basically it's stuff that happens in the game anyway.
7605010	7606732	Um, and, uh,
7608340	7618865	Actually, there's a comparison up of the... You just have to look around on the internets, but there's a comparison between Resident Evil 4, the original, and the HD version.
7619205	7625748	Since I don't have my GameCube hooked up anymore, or my... I mean, I can always use the Wii, but my friends borrowed Resident Evil 4.
7625888	7627488	Like, I'm actually really interested in this.
7627989	7630830	Because unlike some people in the room, I really liked Resident Evil 4.
7631530	7634211	I didn't dislike Resident Evil 4, but I loved Code Veronica.
7634432	7635772	And I liked the second one best.
7637093	7637413	All right.
7637955	7645921	Because the two that are supposed to look like Leonardo DiCaprio totally got killed AkumaJP in the chatroom is asking, will I be able to save?
7647882	7661913	Yes, you just will not be able to erase those saves As long as you have enough typewriter ribbon Perfect answer, DarkSakura, perfect answer I'm actually going to link the articles in the chatroom so people can watch the comparison Amazing
7663237	7668782	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us your tweets as our listeners do every week.
7669483	7671324	And we will go through some of those tweets right now.
7672345	7673266	And let's see.
7674827	7685437	First off, I want to do a tweet from Mad Gear Store who tweeted a bunch of people saying that there's a nice game selection in California Extreme and tweeted us a picture of some of the Bomani that was going up there.
7685751	7687832	And I gotta say, I'm actually kind of sad.
7687972	7689333	I'm actually, no, I'm not kind of sad.
7689373	7691754	I'm really sad that actually I missed California Extreme.
7692134	7694875	It just, it was just on a bad weekend this year.
7694895	7696676	I had a lot going on this weekend, you guys.
7697197	7698397	And I think the others did too.
7698437	7699438	And it's just hard.
7700058	7706581	I could have gone this morning, but I couldn't have justified paying 30 bucks and only being there about four hours, which is what would have happened.
7706601	7709302	They all pack up the last day anyway.
7709342	7712504	So I would have wanted to be there yesterday like all night long.
7712975	7715438	So, unfortunately, I couldn't make that happen.
7716338	7720923	Blue Swim tweeted us earlier in the week going, I usually listen to podcasts as I'm going to sleep.
7721283	7724667	Had several episodes of OLR playing and I ended up dreaming about them.
7725548	7727429	Is that creepy that people like dream of us?
7727449	7728631	We didn't hear what was in the dream.
7729231	7730713	Hopefully it wasn't an erotic dream.
7731033	7732234	I don't think it was.
7736624	7737985	Redertainment sent a tweet earlier.
7738025	7740768	I actually responded to it, but I wanted to bring it up on the show.
7740788	7745932	Redertainment asked, so when are you going to incorporate Google Plus into the show?
7745972	7748254	This is the new social network everyone's talking about.
7749135	7751036	We like to be on the cutting edge of those types of things.
7752117	7755158	As soon as we find a way to do it, we will.
7755538	7765120	Google has actually asked that small and medium businesses stop making personal profiles because they will roll out a business thing, kind of like how Facebook has business pages.
7765440	7767101	They're going to roll that out later in the year, I guess.
7767561	7771742	So as long as we can do it for free or really cheap...
7772282	7774944	We're going to look at doing something like that where we can keep our fans posted.
7775325	7778087	Assuming that Google Plus has something you want.
7778808	7780269	And you know, we're gamers like you.
7780309	7784613	And if this whole thing ends up being spam, spamity, spam, spam, we wouldn't do that.
7784633	7785734	We're not going to contribute to that.
7785834	7794541	But, you know, if it's a place where you can be in a community and talk about games and meet other people that don't want to be jerks when playing online games, then I'm all for that.
7795142	7795322	So...
7796463	7823333	but Google Plus, it's biggest problem right now is that there's not a lot there, like you can see what they're building and a lot of people are really liking what they see in the foundation but there's certainly a lot of other people who look at Google Plus and go, there's fucking nothing there right now, it's so vanilla so, I think Google Plus just needs some time to grow and then we can really see what we can do with it MNZiba you alright there?
7824534	7825554	is a bug attacking you?
7827321	7828901	is a fly attacking you for massive damage?
7828941	7829602	Hit its weak point.
7830382	7830822	There you go.
7831262	7832922	She got a Kleenex and hit its weak point.
7833802	7834763	Squished it to death.
7835943	7836983	I broke one of its wings.
7837243	7837523	Yikes.
7837663	7844005	And then Ziba sends us a tweet saying, this video made me go back to FFXI or Final Fantasy XI.
7844045	7846185	How many of these scenes have you seen in game?
7846986	7853327	So I'm looking at a little scenery, a little quaint scene of plants growing.
7855333	7855933	I don't know what this is.
7855953	7857735	It's supposed to be like a... I've got to skip ahead a little bit.
7859396	7863118	I think it's just some of the pretty shit in-game set to pretty music.
7865440	7865960	You know what?
7866040	7867101	I've got to say, it's funny.
7867581	7872645	You know, you sent this tweet before I told my story at the top of the break about how I got Final Fantasy XI bought for me.
7873045	7881451	But it actually was thinking about a lot of the great scenery and ambience in that game, you know, despite the dated graphical technology, that had me thinking like...
7882031	7906984	I wonder what it looks like now like I wonder if they've made some changes and why Final Fantasy 14 was so fucking disappointing because it should have been 11 improved in high def but instead it was 11 flushed down a toilet in high def and that was what was very disappointing about it Red Entertainment sent us another tweet saying I'd like to start the rumor that the PlayStation 4 will feature Body Movin' the hit song from the Beastie Boys
7907642	7907922	Get it?
7907982	7909924	Because it rips off the Kinect.
7910164	7911665	Get it?
7912326	7919791	Spazernator tweets us and says, No news on free PlayStation Network videos for a while with the fact that my system being dead and needing to be repaired.
7920072	7921012	Yeah, I heard about this.
7921193	7923895	I guess he got the yellow light of death on the PlayStation.
7924395	7926557	He does not have good luck with PlayStation.
7927177	7928438	Yet he supports it.
7928458	7929839	They're trying to tell you something.
7930019	7930580	I know.
7931060	7931861	Rude Sony.
7932061	7933062	Rude, rude Sony.
7935407	7938590	SGO100 Matt tweets us, has Hollywood really run out of ideas?
7938730	7941152	The Space Invaders movie rights have been optioned.
7941832	7946236	And tweets us to a story, I guess, I thought this had already happened some time ago.
7946936	7948577	But it's making the rounds again.
7949398	7954122	The title classic arcade game Space Invaders has been optioned by veteran Hollywood producers.
7954742	7959886	The film rights were optioned by Lorenzo de Benaventura, who made Transformers, G.I.
7959926	7960667	Joe, and Salt.
7961187	7966193	and Oddlot Entertainment, who is behind upcoming movies Drive and Ender's Game.
7967094	7970158	I guess they've also optioned Asteroids.
7971773	7972293	Ah, I see.
7972414	7977937	Last year, Warner Brothers allegedly was seeking the Space Invaders rights itself, but that venture fell through.
7979218	7981899	Where would you make a fucking movie out of Space Invaders?
7982239	7985902	Like, wouldn't it just be Independence Day, but called Space Invaders?
7986122	7986402	Yes.
7986522	7989164	They're never going to make a better alien film than Independence Day.
7989204	7993346	But the soundtrack would be bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
7993486	7996908	No, well, the new Space Invaders games have fucking rad soundtracks.
7997008	7998089	Like, that would be cool.
7998389	8000671	How about a techno-rave version of Independence Day?
8001191	8001291	Yeah.
8001571	8002031	There you go.
8003032	8011278	Today is our Independence Day.
8011918	8013459	DJ Ranma S sent us a tweet.
8013799	8016021	Pac-Man to become a reality show.
8016081	8017402	Didn't this come up on last week's show?
8018117	8019477	I have a little question mark over my head.
8019818	8024799	I guess I'll quickly read this, but I guess Pac-Man is coming to life with a new reality series.
8024899	8032342	Merv Griffin Entertainment is developing an unscripted show about the pellet-eating yellow blob chased by Inky, Binky, Pinky, and Clyde.
8032702	8035443	It's to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the video game.
8036043	8039825	It's a big, crazy, wipeout-type event with a lot of energy.
8040205	8043406	The idea we have is to take what Pac-Man is and bring it to life.
8043806	8044126	DarkSakura.com.
8057219	8058140	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8074668	8075189	to hide $100,000.
8075309	8086676	And if they can keep the money hidden from the feds for 48 hours or something like that, like actual federal agents that try to chase them down and the money for themselves, because the fed agents are competing for the money.
8086976	8088978	Like if they can find it in 48 hours and they get to keep it.
8089298	8091119	And I'm like, that sounds kind of awesome.
8091759	8094681	Like I like shows about like that type of stuff.
8094721	8095542	I would do that.
8096783	8098064	You would do, how would you hide the money?
8098664	8099885	It's very, how would you win that show?
8101431	8108034	You package it up, send it second day air to somewhere, to your house or something like that.
8108094	8113216	But couldn't the federal agents trace everywhere you've been and your steps and the packages you've sent?
8113656	8113796	No.
8114656	8115677	You immediately invest it.

8141584	8144046	I'll tell you what, look, I'm a game show addict.
8144126	8149872	I grew up on old school match game and USA Network game shows like Scrabble and Press Your Luck and all that shit.
8150232	8152094	Did you watch Bumper Stumpers?
8152294	8153876	I fucking love Bumper Stumpers.
8153896	8155337	That shit was awesome.
8155698	8159842	But I'll tell you, my favorite reality game show they ever did
8160522	8161003	Outro Music
8177805	8178305	DarkSakura.com
8204086	8204606	I hate flies.
8204686	8209150	Now keep in mind, I usually comfort myself by saying they'll die in two days anyway because they have a really short lifespan.
8209710	8216676	But this fly has been buzzing all over my damn house so I have a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction and damn it, I deserve a Twinkie.
8217882	8226009	Alright, we have a lot of fucking tweets today, but I gotta get through some of these others Okay, Sterlok tweets us, and now remember I said I wanted to hear from blind gamers?
8226450	8245086	Sterlok, I know, is a blind gamer, and tweets us about the whole glasses story from part A The glasses thing is actually pretty neat Don't have enough usable vision for that, but like the concept So, unfortunately, you know, it's not gonna work for everybody But it's still cool that it will help some people I think that's still really cool, and I think Sterlok sees that too
8246227	8252853	TigerClaw305 tweets us saying, Katamari creator working on a different kind of MMO.
8254295	8257718	What kind of MMO would the person behind Katamari Damacy make?
8258699	8259119	Let's see.
8260300	8264464	TinySpec, a small developer founded by former Flickr employees.
8264985	8270250	Wasn't Spec the name of PeeWee Herman's dog in the PeeWee's Big Adventure movie?
8271630	8272111	Speck!
8272511	8272791	Yeah.
8274073	8275934	I thought you were talking about what was in his pants.
8276675	8276995	Shut up.
8278477	8289108	Announced today that Takahashi, who is the guy behind Katamari Damacy, moved from Tokyo to Vancouver to contribute to Glitch, its web-based MMOs.
8289388	8290309	Ooh, there's even a trailer.
8290369	8291470	Let's take a look real quick.
8291850	8294413	He actually got hired to design a playground.
8296437	8306703	Well, yeah, I knew he was doing the playground, but I see all these people, like little avatars, and they're jumping around like it looks like a 2D platformer game.
8311745	8314407	There's something LittleBigPlanet-ish about this to me.
8316128	8321531	I'm not saying that's what the game is, but it's just LittleBigPlanet on mushrooms.
8324918	8326059	and that's what this game is.
8326119	8326879	It looks kind of like Gaia.
8326899	8331721	There was a wheel and I quickly caught the text on that and it said booty prize.
8332281	8332941	I said booty.
8335482	8336983	Anyway, it looks a little silly.
8338444	8339064	That's kind of cool.
8341516	8343037	I guess if it's free, I'll check it out.
8343077	8346539	But if it's not, I'll have to hear more about it to see if it's worth it.
8347480	8348681	One more tweet from Tigerclaw.
8348741	8351283	Nintendo researching mobile phone possibilities.
8351523	8352563	That's kind of a big deal.
8352683	8353564	How did I miss that one?
8354365	8355145	Think about it, guys.
8356886	8357287	Let's see.
8357387	8364912	Saturo Water responded to a fantastic question pitched at a recent shareholder Q&A that began, I own some shares, but I do not have any Nintendo products.
8364972	8371256	Basically, I think games are a waste of time, and therefore I would like a product that has value added to it so that even I would buy one.
8372016	8372357	Let's see.
8398968	8405090	I gotta say, no disrespect to the tweet or the story or what have you, but this sounds like a whole lot of nothing.
8405170	8406711	This sounds like a whole lot of absolutely nothing.
8406731	8408991	This sounds like Iwata just completely dodging this question.
8409532	8412012	He didn't want to tell the guy, no, we're not doing a fucking mobile phone.
8412052	8413713	He just wanted to give this big answer about...
8414153	8418616	Well, if we did that, we'd have to do this and this, but it's something we're always looking into.
8418636	8429363	Oh, so that they'll say, oh, it's something we may be looking into, but when it comes to actually, you know, talking about games that they're porting over, oh, that, no.
8429383	8435647	I had my hopes up that this was going to be a story about, like, I don't know, Mario Brothers on my iPhone or something.
8436287	8437108	How silly of me.
8437528	8438409	How silly of me.
8439915	8444241	WatchDragon tweets us saying, going old school, just beat Tyrion.
8444782	8446264	Does anyone remember Tyrion?
8448738	8449138	anyone?
8449718	8472447	it was an epic epic mega games shooter from 94 and the minute I saw a screen I admit I cheat and I googled it because I'm like what is this and the minute I saw a screenshot I'm like I played that fucking game back when it was shareware I guess the whole thing was released in 2007 as or no freeware in 04 and the graphics are open license as of April of 07 that's kind of cool
8473922	8475003	Where can you download this game?
8475043	8476785	I'll give a shout out for the download.
8476805	8477225	Let's see.
8480689	8485113	Official Tyrian repository, freewebs.com slash worldtreegames.
8486872	8487252	There you go.
8488493	8489134	One more tweet.
8489374	8489854	Last tweet.
8489954	8493798	Alpha Cananagram tweets us, Did y'all talk about Play for Japan coming out today?
8493918	8495759	Sorry, many distractions on my end today.
8496360	8497240	Actually, we didn't.
8497340	8502064	It hasn't come up yet, so we should say that the Play for Japan album is out today.
8502164	8509130	So if you have not checked it out in iTunes to see if it's something you want to get and help out a good cause, you probably should do that after the show.
8510071	8510851	Play for Japan is out.
8512193	8513237	That does it for Twitter tonight.
8513277	8516428	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to get in on a future week.
8516749	8517592	Back to gaming news.
8517652	8517893	Loki.
8519149	8520210	Yes, I'm sorry.
8520310	8523733	Distracted by a very, very strange picture of Katy Perry for some reason.
8524773	8527075	Why is it that she has, like, that?
8527775	8528596	I don't understand it.
8528636	8529577	That doesn't make any sense.
8529597	8530497	Why is she famous?
8531078	8531598	Exactly.
8531858	8538703	She's famous because she's willing to wear a dress that has whipped cream dispensers on her nipples.
8538803	8540384	That is why she is famous.
8541305	8545568	I gotta admit, she does have some good songs, but sometimes I feel like she's a better songwriter than...
8545968	8549530	And she does have some good nipples, so, you know, that makes sense.
8549550	8554833	Nintendo is actually in the line again for another lawsuit.
8554853	8557995	You know, if it's not motion sensors, it's now going to be 3D.
8558115	8562397	So they are facing a lawsuit over the 3DS technology, mainly the screen.
8563538	8576574	Of course, a company that you've probably never heard of before, Tomata Technologies has a patent suit against Nintendo because they have the patent for technology relating to displaying stereoscopic images on screen for viewing with the naked eye, i.e.
8577115	8578937	without glasses or other devices.
8579357	8579978	Filed in 2003, granted in 2008.
8582581	8590764	and of course they've run up suits for the Wii Fit, GameCube, classic controllers, controller ports, etc.
8592745	8596366	The funny thing about this though is Nintendo doesn't make those screens.
8596466	8597106	Sharp does.
8599347	8599627	Oops.
8601087	8605929	So Nintendo licensed the screen technology from Sharp or whatever or contracted Sharp to put those screens in?
8607710	8628889	and some of the people they were commenting as expected googled automata technologies feels the only notable thing they've ever done is sue Nintendo so once again one of those patent sniping companies I guess patent trolls I feel like patent trolls need a theme song here on the show we'll have to look into that for the future
8629429	8636234	Anyhow, I'm glad I waited to buy this game because the new version that's coming out on PlayStation Network sounds kind of awesome.
8636554	8638336	It's Castlevania Harmony of Despair.
8638756	8643960	If you don't remember this game, it's the HD Castlevania game that was released almost a year ago on the Xbox 360.
8644320	8655808	It's finally coming out to the PlayStation 3, but the good news is your wait may pay off because the PSN version of the game, it will come with a new local four-player cooperative mode and
8655988	8657829	including the six player online mode.
8658369	8667033	There's also going to be the beauty, desire, situation, desire map pack and some extra carriers, carriers, characters that will carry whips and other weapons.
8667554	8669555	Julius Belmont and Yoko Belenades.
8670255	8671495	So kind of cool.
8671756	8678979	Yeah, I, you know, I played the demo of this game and I was kind of like, eh, but I have a lot of friends that are really into it and I think I need to give it a second chance.
8679159	8680940	So I will definitely check it out on PSN.
8681280	8683281	So yeah, very cool.
8684362	8684802	DarkSakura.
8686465	8693807	In other news, for fans of Nights Like Me, there is an OC Remix album put out.
8694067	8695487	It's called Lucid Dreaming.
8695627	8696888	It is a free download.
8697648	8706990	And it has 25 arrangements and two bonus tracks from Nights Into Dreams.
8707570	8712992	And it's actually put out as an anniversary release because 15 years ago it came out on Sega Saturn.
8713932	8723739	So it is available at lucid.ocremix.org And I am going to be downloading the crap out of this when I'm done You love Nights, right?
8723879	8731404	Oh yeah, Nights is fun, although it always made me motion sick But yeah, it's an overclocked remix The whole album is overclocked, so That's cool
8731644	8735967	OC Remix has been getting more and more exposure, it seems, over the years.
8736047	8741030	Like, you know, didn't they do the remix soundtrack for the Street Fighter 2 remix?
8741290	8745172	I think they said this is their 26th album that they've done.
8745413	8750336	Well, yeah, but doesn't this have some type of backing by Sega, or no?
8750356	8751436	This is just a fan thing.
8751576	8752597	I think it was just a fan thing.
8752677	8753197	Oh, my bad.
8753437	8755579	I thought for some reason it was like an endorsed thing.
8756099	8757079	Well, still really cool.
8757139	8757339	Yeah.
8757679	8761220	No, they've done a few fan albums, like the Final Fantasy VII one.
8761420	8762841	There was probably several, more than one.
8763401	8765621	I think there was a Mega Man one, too, so yeah, I'm not surprised.
8765641	8766561	That's cool.
8766641	8772943	I'm looking, actually, at the website under About, and no, it doesn't say that.
8774443	8779024	It just says Fan Project, so I'll link the website in the chat room.
8780465	8780785	All right.
8781405	8781585	Loki.
8781605	8781685	Loki.
8783444	8799235	You know, it was a matter of time, and we even hinted that this is something that may happen, and sure enough, Sony has announced, or I shouldn't even say they've announced, it was mainly found out that they were going to be doing this, and then they acknowledged, yeah, we're doing it.
8800015	8805539	There is now going to be a PlayStation Network pass on first-party games from Sony.
8806039	8810923	Basically, this is just like the other online passes, Project $10, whatever the fuck you want to call it,
8811383	8811643	Could it be $10?
8835773	8836355	It could be $10.
8837117	8837659	It could be $5.
8838101	8839827	That's what other companies are doing.
8840328	8841452	I don't like this trend at all.
8841633	8842155	I mean, just...
8844156	8844517	I don't know
8869661	8877428	I'm sorry, it's just like if you use it, they're using the excuse, well, if you buy it used, the developer doesn't get any of that money.
8877668	8880431	No, they already got that money when the game was purchased new.
8882410	8883491	I don't understand.
8883851	8885712	But you should buy all your games new.
8885972	8887593	Oh, it's a stupid argument.
8887653	8894497	Just like you buy all your CDs new and just like how you buy all your clothes new and there's no such thing as a thrift store.
8895598	8899160	You know, Macy's doesn't get money when you buy that used clothes at a garage sale.
8901101	8901481	Too bad.
8902322	8913672	Then you need to make your games better so that those people think that it's worth paying $60 for or you need to drop your prices down to a reasonable amount where people feel it's necessary to buy.
8915467	8923429	I'm sorry, it's just after all the bullshit that they've done with other things, I don't know why people put up with it.
8923829	8933311	Let me put it this way, if you're still interested in playing this game online and buying it new is not for you, what I recommend doing is waiting a good year before it drops down in price.
8933771	8936751	If that's not good enough for you, then you better buy that sucker new.
8938052	8944253	Or, just shop around, because a lot of people drop the prices of those games at launch, the
8945314	8948597	DarkToyGax in our chatroom saying whoop whoop whoop 0% chance of buying PS3 now oops
8970982	8975083	I hope Microsoft is smart and decides not to do this.
8975623	8977044	I hope that they say, hey, you know what?
8977444	8981845	We're not going to jump on this bandwagon because I have a feeling that it's one of either way.
8982045	8986306	They're either going to jump on it because everybody else is doing it or they're going to hold strong and say, hey, you know what?
8986346	8993609	We don't need to do that because it's going to look really bad if they do it because they're charging for online and then they're charging again for you to get access on.
8993629	8994269	No, I don't know.
8995635	9005441	That's where I'm kind of at with Dark Togek because I'm like, you know, okay, I understand why you're pissed off at Sony, but I'm a little worried that this is just the first of everybody jumping on board with this.
9006862	9012865	Of course, I don't buy a lot of games used, but I kind of like having that option available to me.
9012925	9013946	Well, here's the other thing, though.
9013966	9014666	It's not necessarily used.
9014726	9016027	Especially when they go out of print.
9016147	9017168	It's also rentals.
9017288	9022591	If you're going on Gamefly or something like that and you want to play the online portion of this, well, you're fucking out of luck.
9025166	9027166	Unless you want to pay $10 or whatever.
9029507	9030787	Alright, let's move on.
9031607	9033648	I want to talk about a Facebook game.
9033808	9038049	Yes, a Facebook game, but this is one that's been making a lot of heads turn this week.
9038509	9041449	Civilization World finally launched on Facebook.
9041469	9042109	How do you like that?
9042189	9043990	Remember how I bitched about how I didn't have an invite?
9044270	9047470	Well, I did get one later that night, so thank you, DarkTetsuya, for hooking me up with that.
9047750	9050351	But then not even three days later, it went public.
9051472	9067214	and which is fine at least I got to have like a somewhat early look at it but yeah Civilization World is a new Facebook game and it's turning a lot of people's heads because a lot of people are going this is a really good game and it's a Facebook game I gotta be honest
9068223	9069184	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9088143	9089343	Thanks for watching!
9109131	9116578	But anyhow, I was playing some of the game, and one of the things I really like about it is that you work with a nation.
9116698	9127689	You can join a nation to kind of better yourselves, and you're supposed to be working with these people so that you can beat other nations and you can get the technologies you need to advance yourself as a nation.
9128049	9131753	But at the same time, you're kind of against these same people.
9132133	9137598	Because there's also competition going on amongst you guys for who is on top of your nation.
9137958	9143422	And whoever's on the top of your nation gets more votes and a bigger say to drive the entire nation.
9144003	9149808	So I kind of like that whole teamwork with a knife to your back type of thing.
9150308	9152710	There's something about that kind of gameplay that's actually really rad.
9153030	9156613	And I think that's the element that this game has that no other Facebook game has.
9157053	9159776	And why the rest of it being a really...
9160737	9162398	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9176994	9178155	Thanks for watching!
9192288	9193709	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9215106	9238159	Zynga just is not capable of gaming an invention like this right now because I think they're just all about, you know, pushing out clones of what's essentially the same damn game between the Mafia Wars and the Sorority Wars and the Farmvilles and the Cityvilles and whatevervilles, so...
9239986	9242568	So yeah, Civ World.
9242668	9244849	The story is that yes, it is launched on Facebook.
9244909	9247411	So if you are waiting for an invite, why wait?
9247511	9248091	Go play.
9248472	9250653	The game may be down for maintenance or something though.
9251013	9258759	But yeah, in some of the reviews I'm hearing is that it has a lot of the just one more turn quantities of Civilization.
9259139	9269005	And yeah, that's kind of true, but there is a point where there isn't a lot to do but hover your mouse over waiting for little bonus science outputs and things like that.
9269065	9269606	But I don't know.
9270006	9270506	It's kind of fun.
9273349	9275390	I think it's better than most Facebook games I've ever played.
9276391	9278413	You know what's more fun than a Facebook game, though?
9279414	9280054	Emails!
9280374	9289562	And the emails you send to us every week at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura's gonna dive into the Mailbag right now and read some emails for us to respond to.
9290342	9292503	We actually got something from Holly.
9293163	9293843	Hi, Holly!
9294143	9295963	About the Commercial Felony Streaming Act.
9296543	9297704	So thanks for reporting on this.
9297804	9301545	I've contacted my senator and my congressman, and I've sent it on to my friends and family.
9301985	9305065	Hopefully, if everyone tells them no, we can get this nonsense blocked.
9305226	9306246	Bravo!
9306466	9307006	Good job.
9307046	9308246	That's what everybody should be doing.
9308506	9310387	By the way, we have a follow-up coming later in the show.
9310587	9311287	We'll get to it in a minute.
9311827	9312687	This comes from Rubba.
9313067	9314468	Rubba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
9314748	9318589	Rubba-ba-ba, who I think added me on Steam the other day.
9318709	9318889	Cool.
9318970	9325232	You had a really good caller last week who discussed the kids that were crestfallen about the closure of Virtual Magic Kingdom.
9325692	9327753	You also discussed the Star Wars Momo closing.
9328193	9330894	These things are really good lessons to children and adults alike.
9330994	9332754	They should learn, one, everything ends.
9332834	9337136	Your dog will die, the batteries won't last forever, and MMOs are businesses that will stop supporting it someday.
9337776	9340157	I think this is more for the younger crowd.
9341117	9342758	Virtual goods are not goods.
9342898	9346399	They will someday disappear in an instant when the MMO closes.
9347040	9351982	This is why I find placing cash value on gold or items to be an utter waste of time.
9352422	9354263	Adults still need to learn this lesson.
9355483	9357064	You will not always get what you want.
9357284	9360205	It's funny that many of today's Americans don't understand this concept.
9360405	9360826	Amen.
9362026	9363227	and OnTheBrightSides4.
9363547	9367270	Something new and shiny will come along to make you forget about the old MMO.
9367970	9368771	So there we have it.
9369011	9372173	Dealing with loss, bubble economies, humility and optimism.
9374595	9376957	Things will end and your dog will die.
9377017	9378798	This is kind of a Debbie Downer email.
9379379	9381700	That's true though.
9381760	9383842	Your email gets a sad trombone.
9384162	9385402	It's true though, isn't it?
9386403	9391964	It is, but... It goes back to my old rant about Americans and the sense of self-entitlement.
9393124	9397665	Everyone thinks that everyone owes them something and they don't want to work for anything and you know what?
9398326	9399026	Bite my ass.
9399526	9402367	Oh, except that's too much effort for you to come to my house and bite my ass.
9402587	9408008	Well, what about... Oh, you better be careful because there's some creepsters out there who might actually try to show up at your door and say, I'm here to bite your ass, ma'am.
9408468	9409208	I'll kick them in the balls.
9411729	9412269	What if it's a girl?
9413444	9414224	I'll kick her in the clit.
9416466	9417526	That hurts kind of bad.
9417786	9418407	I would imagine.
9418927	9420708	Anyhow, wow, I just didn't think you'd say that.
9421608	9425270	But what about the whole angle of, but I paid for stuff in the game.
9425630	9428132	I realize the address is in the email, but I don't know.
9428372	9433874	I can see the disappointment if you've actually put money and time into this and then suddenly it's like, oh, I pulled the plug.
9433955	9434435	Well, you know what?
9434515	9436456	I'll be disappointed and sad when my cat dies.
9437036	9438537	I guess you poured a lot of money into her.
9439079	9443922	Well, I've paid for her vet visits and I've bought that bed down there and I feed her and I take care of her.
9444322	9445563	But one day she's gonna go.
9445883	9447564	You know, I'm very sad.
9447604	9448385	I love my cat.
9448485	9452887	But, you know, I've... My computer here, I've got all this shit on it.
9452907	9455989	Grandma and Grandpa gonna die.
9457070	9460652	But you don't need to tell them that because they already know.
9460832	9461773	I don't know when.
9463054	9466656	I don't know how, but one day they gonna die.
9473209	9474869	But you don't need to tell them that.
9474969	9476389	World of Warcraft?
9476469	9477610	They know already.
9478710	9484811	Yeah, but I mean, but seriously, you know, your PlayStation's gonna break one day.
9486451	9487232	Ask Spazinator.
9487672	9489752	I know, yeah, Spazinator should know all about that.
9490792	9492433	Your Xbox is gonna red ring.
9494733	9499034	That little beta that you've got in your pot on your desk at work is gonna die.
9501366	9504968	One day your house will burn down and you won't live there anymore.
9505168	9508549	No, but seriously, everything has an end.
9509490	9509990	Face it.
9510690	9512991	Just because you liked it and it was fun.
9513031	9514212	Including OLR.
9514852	9515092	No.
9515593	9521715	Just because you liked it and it was fun doesn't mean you get to have it forever.
9523016	9523436	Grow up.
9525957	9526237	Okay.
9527318	9527898	Last one.
9528058	9529099	And it comes from Robert M.
9531184	9533166	I recently picked up Atari's Greatest Hits Vol.
9533306	9538489	1 on the DS, first major points off for including Atari VideoCube instead of Yars' Revenge.
9539290	9546075	The games do play very well, though, and although the small screen hurts arcade games such as Gravatar, they control pretty spot-on to the originals.
9546595	9551759	I noticed on the back of the box the proclamation, the most popular casual games of all time.
9552019	9552560	Interesting.
9552920	9557183	Do you consider retro games to be casual, you know, unless you're Steve Weeby or something?
9560412	9567198	They were just different back then Interesting, interesting I think a lot of retro games were just very simple in concept Were they casual?
9567458	9585033	I think a lot of people take a casual approach to it Because I know when you have emulators And you can sample everything at the buffet People will play games for five seconds and be all I remember this Next game I remember this It's like you lick the vanilla ice cream This tastes good You lick the chocolate ice cream This tastes good too
9586134	9591318	Back in the day, when you would drop $50 on those games, they entertained you for a long time.
9592720	9597263	I'm actually going to use a comparison from design theory, actually.
9600726	9609312	Back then, first of all, you didn't have a lot of space to actually store the game on, so you had to do the most you could with the most simple of tools by today's standards, right?
9610353	9613596	Also, we had a longer attention span as people back then.
9613856	9614717	I really think so.
9615277	9616319	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9630319	9630980	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9646956	9660463	buy it or if it's like a catalog for Abercrombie and Fitch it's just naked good-looking 20 year olds butts but it's to sell clothes and they sell clothes through nudity
9660973	9662674	Yeah, but okay.
9663275	9674082	Where it's like you pull up a 50s ad for the toasters and it's like, this makes some fucking amazing toast and the toast will brown just right and Mrs. Cleaver loves it and she uses this toaster every day.
9674402	9680306	This toaster really gets my toast buttered and I love this toaster and it's economical and it looks great in the kitchen.
9682568	9688595	I actually remember recently seeing an article for these ugly-ass plaid bell-bottom pants, but it was an ad from the 70s.
9689135	9694561	And it said, like, something stretch-fiber pants for today's modern man.
9694982	9698245	These type of pants are for the man who wants to get up and put on his pants and go.
9698305	9699246	And it was really...
9699987	9703409	Describing it, you know, like you were watching a TV commercial or something.
9703750	9710574	Well, even television commercials now are pretty simple to the point, you know, because our attention spans are shorter.
9711135	9716158	We are bombarded with so much information and it just gets to be more and more.
9716218	9726865	It's going to be like our photo albums in the future are going to be like from the last Starfighter when the dude shows the little square and it's like 50 million pictures all at once when dude's like, here's my photo, there's them and them.
9726885	9729587	Well, wouldn't that just be like one of those digital picture frames?
9731169	9732951	Yeah, except it does a photo a second.
9733852	9736576	Actually, I think it did like a photo every half second or something.
9736596	9740802	But still, the point is, is that we had longer attention spans back then.
9741202	9747110	And I think a little bit more in the way of determination, we were satisfied with less because back then that was our big thing.
9748763	9765379	and then it keeps pushing the envelope and pushing the envelope and now we have such high expectations that really if it doesn't hit that factor where something's going to change every five seconds and hold your attention, that's exactly what's going to happen.
9765399	9767481	You're going to lose interest in it and you're going to move on.
9768642	9770063	Speaking of which, let's get to the next email.
9771104	9772145	There's no more emails.
9773026	9773907	No more.
9774187	9775449	We're out of email.
9776530	9779233	And just like that, the Mailbag segment has died this week.
9779814	9784258	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to contribute to next week's Mailbag.
9784619	9786441	In the meantime, let's get to some FUs of the week.
9806245	9809671	I don't really have an FU, actually.
9810412	9812917	Okay, FU to alcohol for making my face break out.
9812937	9813317	The end.
9814559	9814760	Loki?
9818932	9822615	I don't have a lot of FUs because I'm coming off a high of a really, really great weekend.
9822635	9828178	But I will say I did have a really bad day this week where just a lot of stuff was going on.
9828238	9829719	Most of it was work-related.
9830019	9832641	And then, of course, everything that I had talked about on WoW.
9833221	9833962	And it's kind of funny.
9834062	9842027	I think I took it out on this week's episode of Horde House because a lot of my guildies that I've been playing with for a couple years now
9843148	9848852	A lot of them listened to the show, and I actually was getting text messages from people going, God, you are so cunty on this week's Horde House.
9849852	9854476	And I'm like, I was having a bad day, and I got home at 5.55, and the show had to start at 6.
9855076	9855977	What do you want from me?
9857618	9865984	But otherwise, things are fucking fantabulous, and I had an amazing weekend, and it erased the memory of my bad day.
9868586	9870887	Except for the fact that I did remember to rant about it.
9870907	9871468	But now it's done.
9871568	9871808	I'm done.
9873695	9874916	We're not done with the news yet, though.
9874936	9876277	We have a few more stories for you guys.
9876337	9881520	And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9881560	9882881	We're not there quite yet.
9883662	9897131	By the way, I've kept Twitter open in another window, and we got another tweet that came in real quick from Zether77 tweeted us saying, you can also get Tyrion, because we mentioned that game earlier, on good old games.
9897651	9898091	Gog.
9899232	9901173	I was not aware, but now I am.
9901714	9902294	I wonder how much.
9902354	9903115	I'll have to check that out.
9904335	9906636	Let's get to a couple more news stories for you guys.
9907416	9916139	We talked about last week Senate Bill 978 where it may affect gameplay videos on YouTube and stuff like that.
9916179	9931503	So if you uploaded pictures of yourself playing a game or something like that and showing the gameplay, that may be considered copyrighted acts and that you'd be basically slapped with a felony charge and jail time.
9932143	9937106	Apparently, though, the way the bill is worded now, they're saying that it actually may not be the case.
9937847	9951635	Basically, the statute can only be enforced in instances where uploaders are willfully infringing on copyright with the intent to make money and is only punishable if said uploader makes or the game company loses over $2,500.
9952175	9957338	And, you know, that's probably not going to be the case for most walkthroughs and stuff like that.
9957918	9959539	It doesn't totally change my opinion.
9959759	9960899	Yeah, I still think it's stupid.
9961039	9966421	I think this report that you are giving us, I mean, don't blame you.
9966481	9983608	I know you're getting it from a game blog somewhere and what folks are reporting on the web, but it's a little bit smoke and mirrors to me because I don't think it detracts from the real issue that, okay, well, whereas a lot of individuals, what about the middleman review companies from businesses that are not IGN, 1UP, etc.,
9984889	9990746	But, you know, still need those hits I mean, for me, this is really bad for small business
9991894	9995736	Yeah, because, I mean, they say, oh, well, you know, unless the company loses over $2,500.
9995977	10003722	Yeah, but, you know, the RIA said that, oh, these record companies have lost millions of dollars from one MP3 download.
10003782	10008044	So, you know, they can make that shit up off the top of their heads.
10008124	10014568	So, you know, why not say, oh, yeah, this YouTube video of some of the gameplay streaming, that cost us so much money.
10015729	10018831	How can you prove that a YouTube lost $2,500?
10020612	10025855	Couldn't a game company say, because you gave my game a negative review, we lost all these sales?
10026175	10028756	Everybody that watched your thing was a potential sale?
10029076	10030697	I mean, that seems so vague to prove.
10030717	10033059	This is a shittily written law, just like I said last week.
10033099	10035300	And yes, I used that word last week, and I'm using it again.
10035420	10035880	Shittily.
10037541	10038442	Shittily's law.
10040443	10042864	Yeah, it's not good.
10046127	10050832	Hey, let's talk about Origin vs. Steam and some of the follow-ups to that.
10050872	10054135	I teased this a little bit before and after this story we'll get into your calls.
10055056	10063585	A forum post was posted by EA's Senior Vice President of Global E-Commerce saying that gamers should be able to buy EA titles on any site they want, including Steam.
10064445	10075774	But, here's the thing, I guess what happened is that the Crysis 2 disappearing from Valve's service was the result of a business deal where certain DLC for the game couldn't appear on Steam.
10076234	10078456	So Valve removed the title completely.
10079076	10082079	Basically, Valve is like, you know, because we...
10082739	10088385	Valve wants to facilitate all the downloads and patches within its own system, which for us, the consumer, I think is really good.
10088585	10089986	I think that's why a lot of us like Steam.
10090267	10092990	But EA's like, no, we want control of that.
10093050	10094851	So now there's a power struggle going on here.
10095663	10103273	Well, anyhow, the forum post went on to say that the Origin platform is a choice for game buyers, not an exclusive outlet for all the publisher's content going forwards.
10104014	10107979	EA is working to integrate more and more between the game and Origin, according to the post.
10108901	10111804	Absolutely not at this point saying, hey, it's Origin versus Steam.
10111864	10112926	It's never been about that.
10115547	10117688	I don't know if I totally believe that, but we'll see.
10119349	10122811	EA wants to continue offering our games for sale on all major download sites.
10123611	10130175	However, you say that on one hand, and then on the other hand, didn't they announce that Star Wars The Old Republic will only be on the new EA store?
10130195	10130555	Uh-huh.
10130695	10130875	Yeah.
10131255	10134177	So already there is a contradiction in your post.
10134337	10138139	So it makes me a little bit apprehensive to believe anything else you're saying.
10139522	10146345	Anyhow, EA posted some digital retailers that are going to be carrying Battlefield 3 and guess who's not on it?
10147006	10149887	Yeah, it's totally not Origin vs. Steam.
10149967	10150527	Oh, not at all.
10150547	10160511	It has nothing to do with trying to crack... It's because they're really trying to offer download content on their own and Steam is being so bad and not letting them do that.
10161312	10161612	Wah.
10162990	10164772	I don't know who to root for in this case.
10164832	10170357	There is a part of me that's like, well, you know, if EA really wants that, why does Steam need that?
10170477	10176283	But I guess that's part of what Steam kind of sells itself on is that all the patching and stuff goes through us.
10176663	10183670	So if your server goes down EA and the game can't patch, we're not dealing on our promise as Steam.
10184534	10185275	I think that makes sense.
10186216	10189260	It does, but I am a little bit torn.
10189600	10196088	I also see where EA says, but I shouldn't have to, every time we want to roll out a patch or something, get permission from Steam to do it.
10196989	10200434	I don't think they'd need permission, but I think that they need to host those files on Steam.
10201792	10212502	I think they're just throwing a little hissy fit because they can't make... I don't think they like the fact that Steam is taking some of their money for the download content and they want all of it.
10212802	10213062	Really?
10213483	10214063	I'm sorry, go ahead.
10214243	10215064	That's what it sounds like to me.
10215745	10219988	Really interesting feedback in the chat room and check which way this is tilting so far.
10220989	10226194	Let's see, Zether in our chat says, they aren't putting Battlefield 3 on Steam because of the DLC clause as well.
10226654	10227976	Not going to buy from EA again.
10228636	10248839	Actdeft says, screw EA, Kaijudo says, Valve, you guys are better than EA, tell EA to fuck off, and Randy says, agreed, fuck EA, and DDR Dollar Bill says, fuck EA, so there's a pretty, I mean, looking at the fans, most people seem to be on Team Valve, it chatters, is anybody Team EA, curious?
10250165	10253750	There's a lot of it that says, or Ranma says buy used.
10254611	10258216	Or, I don't think you can buy used PC product, really.
10259217	10261660	Or, you just go out to the store and buy it.
10261740	10263343	I mean, you don't need that digital copy.
10263383	10264985	You can just go buy it at a store.
10267793	10268193	There you go.
10268393	10269314	Or just buy a console version.
10270215	10273357	Some other things on the whole Origin stuff.
10274037	10278960	One other thing I want to mention is about the Origin is actually coming to the iPod, iPhone, and Android.
10278980	10283723	There's a cross-platform Scrabble game coming for free to Android.
10283743	10284824	Yay.
10285264	10287546	To be fair, that is something that Steam doesn't do.
10287686	10290488	Steam doesn't deal in the iPad iOS universe right now.
10290888	10309122	there's a part of me though that's like well how does that work because I thought Apple had the exclusive stuff on that like I thought you had to do everything through Apple so how do you launch a new store unless it's like the origin app that has all these mini games that you can buy within it like that has to be what it is yeah right interesting
10310102	10335267	EA did demo the mobile offering the Origin app will let you see your friend list which I'm assuming is across the computer and the phone the accompanying news feed and sharing what everybody is doing on Origin no matter what platform that they're on there's a new version of Need for Speed on iOS and it was launched from Origin and Origin pushes your friend's leaderboard data into the game and they said at EA that this was not possible before Origin
10337361	10341184	Well, they can say whatever they want, but I mean, I think, you know, it's possible.
10341604	10343525	Look at, you know, OpenFaint.
10345306	10349268	Yeah, but OpenFaint isn't really an app.
10349489	10352710	It's an enhancement to existing apps.
10352730	10363517	Yeah, but they're saying that it wasn't possible to be able to share leaderboard data without EA's origin thing, but that's bullshit because... There's GameCenter.
10364329	10369576	There's Game Center and there's OpenFaint, and I'm sure that other people can find ways to do stuff like that.
10369717	10371459	I mean, whatever.
10371759	10371940	Fine.
10372881	10373582	PR spin.
10374523	10381233	GamerGirl in chat says, only for Sims, but otherwise EA stands for Eat Ass, as in EA eats ass.
10384954	10388016	Ranma says, I liked EA better when they were known as Electronic Arts.
10388756	10391237	I liked EA better when they were ECA.
10391577	10393158	Want to go back in time a little bit?
10393918	10399901	Check out some of the loading screens on my favorite Commodore 64 games like Pinball Construction Set was an ECA game.
10402042	10403962	Did anybody ever play Pinball Construction Set?
10404643	10405803	That game was fucking rad.
10406023	10406263	No.
10407284	10407564	Anyhow.
10410474	10410775	That's it.
10410835	10411536	Let's take some calls.
10411556	10412958	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10413018	10414980	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10415000	10423030	The Skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight on the show or something else that you think we haven't covered yet.
10423410	10424892	Skype line is open.
10425193	10428617	While we wait for some calls, thanks to the delay, Loki, you have any last-minute stories for us?
10428717	10429117	Yeah, sure.
10429698	10431959	One of the things that came out this week was kind of cool.
10431979	10440003	They had a mod for Call of Duty Modern Warfare that basically turned it into a version of Battlefront.
10440323	10442444	So you can actually go check that out.
10442524	10447967	I think they're calling it Star... I can't remember what the hell they called it now.
10448467	10448728	It's like...
10453111	10480443	some Star Wars game I gotta find the damn link now it looked neat though I mean it basically looked like Battlefront so whenever that actually makes its way out but it's finally done you can actually download it for free yay free exactly I guess they're selling 8-bit glasses now they kinda look stupid if you ask me yeah I saw them too and I was like meh
10481766	10482807	Did you see that they have an app?
10482847	10485189	Remember we were saying that it might happen or something like that?
10485309	10493017	But the free-to-be-kicked, it was for the people that are playing free-to-play Team Fortress 2 that they get kicked out.
10493057	10497121	Yeah, and I was saying that's everything that's wrong with gaming culture, but yeah.
10497521	10498422	Yeah, that kind of sucks.
10501165	10503107	Let's see here if I can find this here.
10503227	10503707	Ah, there we go.
10503747	10505189	Galactic Warfare is what it was.
10505909	10506049	And...
10507947	10508387	How'd it go?
10509628	10510149	Let's see.
10510529	10521118	And you can find that on the ModDB website.
10521738	10522319	Let's see here.
10523737	10525118	Yeah, moddb.com.
10525238	10529721	Just search for the Star Wars Galactic Warfare mod for Call of Duty 4.
10531542	10532383	Looks pretty awesome.
10535185	10535705	Let's see.
10535945	10537567	What other stuff we could talk about here?
10537927	10539328	Again, Skyplane is open.
10539348	10540669	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10540749	10542510	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10542550	10543611	We'll give it another couple minutes.
10543631	10544771	Maybe nobody wants to call tonight.
10548054	10554199	Zether in our chat says, apparently Sega may not be releasing the second Phantasy Star PSP game or Valkyria Chronicles 3 here.
10554520	10560045	Yeah, I was reading about that second Phantasy Star PSP game, but I'm more looking forward to this whole Phantasy Star Online 2.
10560405	10561286	Remember?
10561526	10562246	That's still coming.
10563728	10564448	I want to try it out.
10564749	10565109	Me too.
10566210	10568912	Zether says it's possibly due to piracy causing poor sales.
10569994	10570875	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10586673	10601689	I guess Xbox Live Indie games creators are expressing their disappointment with the low sales on the service they say that there's not enough exposure for their games and like for example there was you know
10602069	10605791	Sequence, which sold around 2,000 copies.
10606071	10607432	They said it's kind of a flop.
10607792	10610453	He's looking at PC and mobile platforms for future projects.
10610613	10621358	He says it's not financially viable to do a large-scale project and not expect with any certainty to make some money on the indie marketplace.
10621458	10627681	Also, they said that Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World, both pretty well-known games,
10628401	10647376	on the marketplaces sold 50,000 and 16,000 copies each respectively making them relative hits for indie games and they said I think that our games could sell a lot better than they did with a better platform more visibility and he's testing that by releasing both of them on Steam on July 13th for $3
10649215	10650416	Hey, the phone's finally lighting up.
10650456	10651456	Let's see who's on the other line.
10651496	10652477	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10652517	10652857	Who's this?
10653417	10654297	Legend of Zaku here.
10654378	10654738	Hey, buddy.
10654758	10655198	How you doing?
10655938	10656458	Nothing much.
10656639	10658079	Just like relaxing.
10658900	10659740	I miss New York.
10659760	10660560	For tomorrow.
10661041	10663822	Granted, I had like a nasty weekend of just working.
10665223	10668064	Yes, I had to show up to work on a Saturday.
10668284	10669485	Working on the weekend.
10669565	10671486	Well, life sucks.
10671526	10673086	I've had to work on Saturday, too.
10673827	10675948	Yeah, I'm going to need you to come in on Saturday.
10676400	10680222	Yeah, I think my boss was jokingly referring to that.
10681242	10683203	He did the Bill Lumberg voice.
10683483	10684664	Oh, great, great.
10684924	10686484	Well, at least he had a sense of humor about it.
10687185	10692187	Yeah, but at least it got done yesterday, and at least I'm relaxing today.
10692727	10692927	Nice.
10694048	10698850	So, basically, yeah, that whole EA Origin thing, yeah.
10699642	10705068	I was betting the barn on Battlefield 3 showing up on Steam, but because of this shit, I don't know.
10705128	10708692	On one hand, I have almost four-year-old hardware, but on the other, I have...
10719965	10723728	No games that I'm looking forward to to justify it.
10724328	10727391	And I'm not talking about Modern Warfare 3 because that's a non-starter.
10728211	10731353	That game is like, I'm not going to jump on that hype bandwagon.
10731373	10732634	I was banking on Battlefield 3.
10733935	10738819	But if they pull out some bullshit copy protection stuff, that's going to turn me off.
10740060	10744523	It needs to be like Steam where even though there is copy protection, it doesn't feel like it.
10745299	10746760	It's oblivious to the user.
10747381	10748301	And that's how it should be.
10748361	10749522	It should be non-intrusive.
10749863	10750683	Agree, agree.
10752104	10762152	But we don't know how Origin's going to play out because it used to be known as Download Manager and even then they still had plenty of copy protection on the games they sold through that one.
10762412	10771276	That's, you know, one reason, I truly think... Hold on, Zaku.
10772116	10780120	Zaku, I really think that the reason people are all over Steam doesn't even have to necessarily do with its interface and all of that.
10780540	10783421	I think it's honestly the crazy fucking deals they have on there.
10783481	10786042	I don't think anybody would have given Steam a second look otherwise.
10786403	10787703	I think it would have been about as popular as X-Fire.
10787723	10790484	Sure, that may be true because they can, like, you know, these...
10792205	10792566	Saku, Saku, Saku
10806797	10812102	Um, faintly, I think I've seen him in certain episodes from time to time.
10812422	10815225	Here's the thing, no, no, it's not a user, it's an actual program.
10815485	10821070	And I think MTV Games bought them, thinking it was going to be the next big thing.
10821510	10830758	Steam blew that program out of the fucking water, because what they did is they took a lot of the things that X-Fire brought to the table and built a store around it that had...
10831198	10833199	Killer Deals, and now every-
10852910	10856312	My point is, Steam didn't really bring anything new to the table.
10856712	10857493	It just made it.
10857573	10858814	It's like Apple.
10858874	10861335	Yes, it brought it to the table extremely well.
10861595	10863276	Kind of like a lot of Microsoft products.
10863837	10864697	Like the Xbox.
10865958	10872042	Well, it's more like Apple taking something that already exists but marketing it well to the point where they make money.
10872562	10873703	And that's what Steam did.
10873743	10875704	They know how to market something like this.
10875724	10877846	Something that gamers would want to go after.
10877946	10878526	My point.
10878686	10879667	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10894184	10900987	I mean, the way I see it is that, to them, Origin is something that's completely out of place to their norms.
10901547	10902708	Case in point, Steam.
10902808	10904449	It's something that they feel comfortable with.
10904909	10912012	If you throw in Origin, it's something that hasn't been proven, and it's not tried and true yet, and it's something that EA's still working on.
10912032	10920136	It's still in its infancy, so it's the uncertainty that Origin brings to these guys, to these people that are hesitant about it.
10920936	10925698	And that's what's causing the rift and backlash, you know, in my honest opinion.
10926238	10935702	It's like, I know Battlefield 3 will be an awesome game, but the way that the distribution is like, that plays an integral role in the fact that it can make or break their sales.
10936242	10942425	You don't want somebody downloading a lemon, which is going to be useless if it's locked down pretty tight.
10942565	10942705	Yeah.
10943605	10946168	to the point where only pirates will have the best experience.
10946188	10946688	Well, I agree.
10947088	10951933	The thing about Origin is that the first copy protection or whatever type of mistake they make will kill them.
10952313	10959600	And this is the interesting thing about new technologies is that the first mistake, if they make it early on, will murder them.
10959860	10961301	Case in point, Google Buzz.
10961742	10965545	Google Buzz was murdered by what they did with the privacy thing.
10965565	10967287	They're toast if they screw up
10967967	10975774	If they screw up to the point where it reaffirms that Steam is the only choice, then that's it.
10976374	10982759	EA basically has a walking dead man right there in Origin.
10984461	10993428	The way that Origin can not only be on par, if not maybe outdo Steam, is try to bring something that hasn't been...
10994451	11003202	You know, first of all, they have to, like, one, make sure that the copy protection is, like, not oblivious and more importantly, not obstructive.
11004267	11012112	The second point is they have to do something unique that differentiates themselves from Steam.
11012933	11014674	Aside from what Steam has already done.
11014694	11017236	I'm pretty certain that they're going to have all the social aspects.
11017276	11020398	It needs to show me what is worth leaving Steam for.
11020618	11029404	And if they can't produce killer fucking deals that convince me to drop $40 on a bunch of games I'll probably end up only playing once, then I'm not so sure they're going to come out ahead.
11029644	11033226	They need to have a contingency plan of origin for some reason.
11034587	11037009	fails, what happens to their digital content?
11037049	11039251	Then they're right back where they were a year ago.
11040211	11042053	They'll be fine.
11042113	11042613	I understand.
11042633	11044975	I'm not talking about right now, but more long term.
11045475	11048077	They need to have some sort of contingency plan in place.
11048137	11055162	I'm pretty certain Valve has something in place should Steam ever fail and they would have to wind down.
11056143	11062448	Because they're going to see a lot of pissed off people where their digital content is not worth jack and they can't hold on to it.
11063322	11071708	Remember, the content is only as good as the service that's backing it up, that enables you to actually play it.
11071869	11076852	Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go, but before I let you go, I am getting a request from chat.
11078394	11085879	No!
11088581	11090763	Alright, Zaku, thanks for your call.
11092184	11092524	Alright.
11092785	11093105	Nian,
11096744	11105128	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio What do you think about EA versus Steam and all this stuff?
11105909	11112212	Let us know Meanwhile, do we have more last minute stories or did you burn them all?
11114733	11123478	I burned them all Good job, Loki They burned on a fire Good job Alright, so are we ready to announce what you're working on over there or do you need more time?
11125379	11134290	It did come to my attention that OLR does try to be on the cutting edge of a bunch of social eds, but there was one that we've all been using that we're not using at OLR yet.
11134310	11137073	I'll go ahead and tell everybody, but I'm still working on the theme.
11138174	11139055	We have a Tumblr now.
11139856	11140737	There'll be stuff on it.
11140797	11141398	We're hipster.
11143040	11144701	We'll post it with lots of pictures from Reddit.
11145402	11147884	Tumblr is a really easy way to cross-post stuff.
11148104	11151226	It's the ultimate photo blog.
11151306	11153687	It's MAME central.
11153747	11156129	When somebody sees something funny, they just post it to their Tumblr.
11156209	11156649	No words.
11156809	11158890	Well, you can post words, like quotes and things.
11159131	11160111	Just pictures and stuff.
11160592	11162913	And videos, but you can actually use it as a regular blog.
11163093	11164294	Yeah, some people will want to follow that.
11164914	11165535	We'll see what happens.
11166175	11167556	Alright, let's go to the phones and take another call.
11167576	11168396	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11168416	11168737	Who's this?
11169237	11170157	Hey, hey, it's Ranma.
11170257	11170938	Hi, what's up, buddy?
11171690	11172151	Not much.
11172331	11174473	Well, I have some interesting news to tell.
11174753	11175114	Oh boy.
11176135	11177416	Oh no, you'll like it.
11179038	11180419	I am getting a PlayStation 3.
11182021	11182622	Yes!
11183022	11183923	Why are you getting a PlayStation 3?
11185563	11186224	Thanks for watching!
11203985	11206426	First Ends are better anyways because they have full backwards compatibility.
11207627	11210308	I use mine to the fullest by not playing any PlayStation 2 games.
11210708	11217392	God, I wish... You know, I know there's some people that would look at me and go, why don't you just get a PS2 if you want to play PS2 games?
11217432	11225836	But I can't tell you, having owned all the fucking consoles I do, I can't tell you how fucking convenient it is to have multiple in one box.
11226256	11232179	Like, I really wish I lived in a world where the Wii, the 360, and the PlayStation 3 were just one fucking console.
11232539	11232759	Like...
11234280	11234821	Why can't I
11263476	11264116	Dan!
11265097	11265897	Explanation!
11266177	11267678	Oh, he says it's coming to DVD too.
11268919	11269999	It's also on DVD.
11271480	11280605	Well, the fact that I heard that first, I'm like, well, for me, if that's not a reason to get a PS3, I don't know what is since most of my games are in a 360, but my question is this.
11280645	11282926	You can play Demon's Souls and LittleBigPlanet.
11282986	11283686	Oh my god, LittleBigPlanet.
11283706	11284507	Yes, Dan is correct.
11284647	11286868	I just double-checked on Amazon.
11287668	11288229	Both are available.
11289249	11292091	You were lied to by a lying liar.
11293044	11318452	I will pistol whip her later alright with love any other thoughts Ranma before I let you go I want to know what game should I get for my PS3 I want to pick from all three of you you absolutely need LittleBigPlanet absolutely the must have game on Playstation 3 DarkSakura Dance is Infamous Loki
11319338	11321219	I would do Resistance.
11321259	11325482	You can probably pick up, they have the Resistance dual pack now with 1 and 2 in there.
11325522	11327724	Just pick that up and it's a good time.
11328424	11328845	There you go.
11329665	11330266	Works for me.
11330766	11334789	Alright, well have fun with your PS3 and add me, K. I will, dude.
11334909	11335209	Alright.
11336150	11338371	Bye.
11338572	11340673	1877 GameOLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
11340773	11342154	I guess we can fit in one more call.
11342274	11343415	One quick little call.
11344474	11348557	See, it does suck because I do have to still pick up Infamous, or not Infamous, Resistance.
11348917	11350058	Actually, I have Infamous now.
11350098	11355181	I download, or I have the download mark for my PS3 from Welcome Back, and I have number two.
11355602	11359585	Although, I'm probably going to sell number two because I don't know if I'll really get into the series.
11360885	11363647	Randy in our chatroom says, quick, back out of the purchase, Ranma.
11363727	11365028	Yeah, back out so I can buy it.
11368109	11371410	Although that would be a waste of money because I really do have a PS2 already and all that good stuff.
11371490	11373011	All right, I guess we've got time for one more call.
11373031	11373471	Let's take this.
11373511	11374411	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11374431	11374772	Who's this?
11375992	11377193	Hi, this is Spazinator.
11377233	11377833	Hey, Spazinator.
11377873	11378333	What's up, buddy?
11380474	11382215	Well, two things.
11383435	11394619	Just in reference to the last call that you just had, if I were to recommend any games for the PS3...
11397299	11399781	Siphon LittleBigPlanet, which you already mentioned.
11400482	11405766	I would probably go with the Resistance games.
11407268	11409910	Those would be good.
11410190	11411431	I want to say this, though, real fast.
11411651	11420639	Ranma, if you have the money, just do LittleBigPlanet 2, because all the old LittleBigPlanet levels, you can play in LittleBigPlanet 2, meaning the created levels online, just so you know.
11421755	11422796	What else?
11423897	11430604	I hate to say it, because you guys know I've been a really big supporter of PlayStation 3 and all that.
11430924	11437250	I know, and you're that abused significant other that keeps coming back.
11439613	11443497	I'm practically Sony's red-headed stepchild right now.
11443577	11445138	Yeah, yeah.
11446900	11453225	Since March of last year, I have had three PlayStation 3s get the yellow light of death.
11453385	11464695	I mean, honestly, if it weren't for the fact that I got so much money invested in the system, in terms of downloadable games and, of course, the videos,
11467079	11468400	I've got to ask this though, Spazinator.
11468460	11472584	Is there anything you think there might be about how you use your PlayStation 3?
11473064	11473785	I have to ask it.
11474065	11475046	That could be contributing.
11475506	11477768	Do you leave it in a poorly ventilated place?
11477908	11482732	Do you use the thing so much that it just can't handle it?
11482772	11483733	Is it on all day?
11484313	11484573	I don't know.
11484593	11485174	I'm trying to think.
11485634	11487275	What could be your luck?
11487295	11490338	The only thing I could come up with
11490868	11503433	that could possibly factor into it is that my entire building as a whole is practically hotter than a hemorrhoid on Satan's ass during the summertime.
11504033	11514977	At least in terms of my particular place, I store my system, normally try to keep it
11516050	11521775	You know, ventilated, you know, at least 10 inches on each side, you know, for ventilation and all that.
11521835	11526619	But, you know, during the summertime, the building just gets hot, you know.
11526959	11541832	But, you know, that can't totally factor into it because, you know, because, you know, my system, you know, I got the old wire down twice last spring and my building doesn't even get hot.
11542555	11543536	Hot during the spring.
11543576	11546298	In fact, it's practically freezing cold during the spring.
11546318	11550621	Well, let me ask this because this is the question that the chatters are dying to know the answer to.
11550761	11552102	Are you breaking up with Sony?
11552322	11552902	Is this it?
11553082	11557646	Are you saying, Sony, I want to see someone else and her name is Microsoft?
11559787	11561548	I'm severely tempted to.
11561568	11569434	The only reason I'm even constantly having my system fixed is like I was starting to see like a minute ago is that
11570117	11585046	I have so much money invested in downloadable games, the DLC, and the videos, I just hate to see myself lose access to that stuff that I already bought or got for free up until now.
11587027	11592651	At least for a time being, if I do get it fixed, I've been playing my...
11594306	11600551	You know, 360 lot along with WoW since I just started WoW like a week or two ago.
11600691	11605815	But, you know, it just kills me that the system just died.
11605835	11611759	Plus, now, what little money I have coming soon was already earmarked for something else.
11612640	11619985	And now I'm going to have to scrounge up money to get my system fixed and rearrange my plans and stuff like that.
11620025	11622707	So, it's a pain in the ear to watch.
11622787	11623328	Right, right.
11624474	11628697	Well, keep us posted on what happens in this ongoing saga.
11629018	11630459	And, you know, good luck.
11631800	11633661	Maybe see if Ranma will sell you that PS3.
11634582	11634922	I don't know.
11635463	11635703	All right.
11636103	11636584	All right, Spazinator.
11636604	11637684	I've got to let you go to wrap up the show.
11637704	11638225	But take care, buddy.
11638705	11639306	All right.
11639326	11639886	Have a good one.
11639946	11640386	All right.
11640406	11640707	Bye-bye.
11641487	11645709	Man, we had the sad trombone email, and now we have the sad trombone phone call.
11646849	11649450	Three PlayStation 3s get the yellow light of death.
11650410	11651450	Some guys have all the luck.
11652671	11655012	And yet he didn't say, I'm breaking up with Sony.
11655052	11660313	He said, you know, I just... I've spent so much on Sony over the years.
11660674	11661814	I still love Sony.
11663422	11666166	Alright, this is the part of the show where we wrap it all up.
11666206	11667769	Thank you guys for calling in tonight.

11682562	11685565	But not before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

11696137	11697378	We really would appreciate it.

11699941	11700501	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11725811	11730056	My final thought is long show means no Pinkberry frown.
11730857	11731178	Loki.
11731919	11735423	I have a headache and I really need to remember to bring Dan Wangan Midnight for the PS3.
