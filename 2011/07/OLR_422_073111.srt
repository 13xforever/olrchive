1
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:12,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Sky, and Loki.

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight, July 31st, 2011, Nintendo slashes the price of the 3DS.

3
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,250
[SPEAKER_05]: The average price of an Xbox Live Arcade title is going up.

4
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:25,135
[SPEAKER_05]: And could the PlayStation 3 soon feature a doll?

5
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:32,277
[SPEAKER_06]: PinkBerry

6
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:02,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it's been about a week and a half.

7
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:04,393
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you feel disconnected.

8
00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:07,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then maybe we should end the show early and go get Pinkberry.

9
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm down with that.

10
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:10,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week's show was a marathon.

11
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:11,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the show.

12
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:11,717
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

13
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:12,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night, everybody.

14
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:14,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Blah, blah, blah, Nintendo.

15
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:15,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Blah, blah, blah, Ubisoft.

16
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:15,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

17
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,080
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just kidding.

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,441
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

19
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:20,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

20
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:21,923
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing, Loki?

21
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:23,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing great.

22
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:24,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you feeling connected?

23
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:25,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you on the grid this week?

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm on the grid.

25
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,662
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've never joined us for a live show, it's a totally different experience.

26
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:46,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I really encourage you to.

27
00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:54,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, here at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

28
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:58,535
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do have some folks in our chat room already starting there.

29
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:00,057
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see where we got here.

30
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:04,081
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says, this episode of OLR is brought to you by a higher debt ceiling.

31
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:18,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they got all that crap fixed but I hear it's still stalemate but I don't want to get too political because I'll just get angry because that stuff kind of has a direct impact on my life if that starts affecting the unemployment and all that like they're saying is going to happen.

32
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:24,590
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's try to move on to happier topics like games that keep us entertained when these things go wrong in our country.

33
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with how is your gaming week?

34
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,230
[SPEAKER_10]: It was.

35
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I played WoW all up until the show.

36
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:38,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to get that achievement, the classic dungeon master, whatever.

37
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:40,981
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, achievements weren't around when you first started playing WoW.

38
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:47,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think achievements have kind of, clearly they were just ripped right off Xbox Live, but do you think they've really added something to the WoW experience?

39
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:48,885
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

40
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:05,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I mean, it's kind of fun.

41
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,085
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'll get like a wild hair and say, okay, I'm going to finish this.

42
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:10,306
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it'll give me an excuse.

43
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:14,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Because honestly, my favorite character to play is my 85 mage.

44
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:15,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I love my mage.

45
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:18,768
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it just gives me an excuse to keep playing her.

46
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of, oh, I can't really do anything right now.

47
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:29,170
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll just, I guess, work on this other one instead of making another mage and leveling another mage.

48
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,192
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know somebody, though, who has eight level 85 druids.

49
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:38,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anything in the non-MMO universe that you've been up to?

50
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:39,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Groove Coaster.

51
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:41,258
[SPEAKER_10]: That game is fun.

52
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:42,439
[SPEAKER_10]: And I blame Shane.

53
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,620
[SPEAKER_10]: It's his fault.

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,281
[SPEAKER_06]: And Groove Coaster, of course, on the iOS, right?

55
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:48,343
[SPEAKER_06]: It's iPad and iPhone, right?

56
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:49,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 3GS and Apple.

57
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:52,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming it'll work on the iPod, unlike Google+, apparently.

58
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:55,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Does not work on anything with the iPhone, which is a little silly, but...

59
00:03:55,988 --> 00:04:14,742
[SPEAKER_10]: and the app really is not that great it's more stable than Facebook's app at this point you know I haven't updated Facebook app since they changed the photos oh really so I didn't update to that one because someone warned me so I haven't updated my Facebook app in like months nice

60
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:15,891
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm not going to

61
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:56,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe tomorrow, on a Monday, maybe it got pushed back, who knows It's going to be very interesting when the games roll out Because it's going to make the two go head-to-head even more But right now, I think it's still too early to tell But I think a little valid competition And yeah, clearly everybody wants a piece of the social networking space But, you know, Facebook, or I should say Google Plus Has really succeeded at biting at Facebook's kneecaps In places where MySpace...

62
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Orkut, Buzz, even, you know, and other social networks have failed to do so.

63
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wait until Myspace rolls out their even better game service.

64
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:06,042
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming back, baby.

65
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:07,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you never know.

66
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:08,683
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

67
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:15,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, as things change ownership and things change hands and so forth, you never know.

68
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:17,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ever count out somebody who's been gone for a while.

69
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,428
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at Origin, right?

70
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:24,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Origin was an EA brand that kind of disappeared, unfortunately, because they used to make a lot of great games back in the day.

71
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:26,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the brand faded.

72
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's back as a store.

73
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:29,737
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be interesting.

74
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:31,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Could MySpace come back as a store?

75
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:32,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not.

76
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:37,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, I just want to say the competition, I think, is a little bit healthy for Facebook.

77
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:41,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, they do say that festering piles of crap work as fertilizer.

78
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:41,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

79
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:43,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Oendan, Elite Beat Agents

80
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:31,352
[SPEAKER_10]: but the lines keep moving and they'll sneak up on you and like the track will curve and that has a very vib ribbon type of vibe to it it really just made me think of playing vib ribbon except you know you're just pushing little you know you're tapping along and sometimes it's easy to figure out what the rhythm is but sometimes it's really freaking difficult I'm still kind of getting used to it but it's got the first Arkanoid song which was boop boop you know that was pretty fun and I actually got a little motion sick off of it

81
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:32,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

82
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:33,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know that I'd be able to do it.

83
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:37,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it is very light, seizure-y, you know, fast motions.

84
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,804
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on the parts where it starts spiraling downwards.

85
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Then that's where I get a little motion sick.

86
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:44,769
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very interesting.

87
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:47,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing a lot of Groove Coaster this week, too, because obviously, you know, I love music games.

88
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:48,533
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a dollar.

89
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:49,274
[SPEAKER_06]: No secret.

90
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:49,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's...

91
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:50,615
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a buck.

92
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:10,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

93
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:15,412
[SPEAKER_06]: So, definitely, if you're a music game fan at all, you definitely want to check out Space Invaders.

94
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:19,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can check out Space Invaders, too, but a groove coaster is only a buck.

95
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:24,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I love so much about this game, it's the perfect phone game, in my opinion.

96
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:27,004
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everything you want out of a phone game.

97
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:31,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Except, you cannot sneak into the bathroom at work and play it unless you have your headphones.

98
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:33,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yes, there is that.

99
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I suppose there's that.

100
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,192
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing about Groove Coaster is that you can play it in short little minute and a half, three minute boosts.

101
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,354
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very pretty to watch.

102
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:48,737
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's that kind of like audio stimulation, visual stimulation, little diversion for just a few minutes.

103
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:51,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you could sit there and play every song and be diverted for an hour.

104
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:51,879
[SPEAKER_10]: But no trans vibrator mode.

105
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:53,380
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no trans vibrator mode.

106
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:00,284
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think in some ways it's like just, it was designed very well with the phone audience in mind.

107
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:01,605
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's what's great about it.

108
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:10,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Because half of playing it is kind of just those visuals of going around the spirals and ooh, ah, I'm in a trance for three minutes and wasting my time.

109
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:16,934
[SPEAKER_10]: But coaster is a very good word because it really is like this massive galactic roller coaster.

110
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,575
[SPEAKER_10]: And it even shows you the track when you're done.

111
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:20,436
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's kind of cool.

112
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:22,839
[SPEAKER_10]: See the path you've been on

113
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:35,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

114
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:37,348
[SPEAKER_10]: I really had a good time with it.

115
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:42,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, I've gotten up to the first Arkanoid song, which is like, what, the second stage?

116
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:45,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Or second set of stages or something?

117
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:46,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

118
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:52,843
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's different, you know, I guess musicians that have worked on the tracks for the game, so it's pretty cool.

119
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:54,004
[SPEAKER_10]: And then...

120
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:55,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Workin' it.

121
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:10,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, yeah, I'm doing cross-training now.

122
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:12,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, at some point, I'm going to have to loan you one of my Kinect games.

123
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:13,374
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have Kinect?

124
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:16,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I have a Kinect I haven't opened because I haven't had anything I want to play.

125
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:19,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you'll have to try one of these fitness games that I was trying out.

126
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:21,759
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be into it if you're all about fitness and stuff.

127
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:22,940
[SPEAKER_10]: I really want to try the UFC game.

128
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

129
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:24,881
[SPEAKER_06]: UFC trainer.

130
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard interesting things about that.

131
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:28,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I want to train to be an ultimate fighter.

132
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:30,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just train to be it.

133
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:30,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I don't know.

134
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:33,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes in these arguments, I've got to take Jamie out.

135
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,941
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

136
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:16,489
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had our company game summit thing So some of the publishers brought out things for me to try Oh yeah, you got a little slice of E3 at your door this week, didn't ya?

137
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:19,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Very small slice of E3 Alright, well what'd you check out?

138
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:23,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I played the newest build of K'nex Star Wars

139
00:10:25,195 --> 00:10:27,017
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a couple things about it.

140
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:35,125
[SPEAKER_08]: One, they said that apparently they took development staff off of Dance Central 2 to finish polishing up Connect Star Wars.

141
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:37,468
[SPEAKER_08]: But Harmonix makes Dance Central.

142
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:39,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but it's still Microsoft.

143
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Microsoft doesn't own Harmonix.

144
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:44,853
[SPEAKER_08]: But they still have staff working on that.

145
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:45,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

146
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:52,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little... That seems a little... Well, it's just... Or is it one of those disingenuous things where we move some of the marketing staff?

147
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:52,877
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

148
00:10:52,897 --> 00:10:53,937
[SPEAKER_06]: It has nothing to do with the game.

149
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:54,538
[SPEAKER_06]: It's development staff.

150
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:57,659
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing as... It's LucasArts making the game.

151
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I understand that.

152
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, okay.

153
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's what the rep told me.

154
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,122
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, fair enough.

155
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:03,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Just repeating what I heard.

156
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:04,523
[SPEAKER_06]: A little strange, but all right.

157
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:06,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially... Different coasts, too.

158
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:08,185
[SPEAKER_06]: LucasArts is over in the Bay Area, right?

159
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:08,465
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

160
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:16,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where their video game development house is I'm assuming it's North Bay like the rest of LucasArts but then of course Harmonix is out in Boston

161
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:20,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying I don't know, okay?

162
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:21,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, fair enough.

163
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:27,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd assume it's more than just maybe one development house working on it.

164
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:30,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, played a bit of Kinect Star Wars.

165
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:36,130
[SPEAKER_08]: They had, of course, at Comic-Con, the new build had pod racing in it.

166
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:41,254
[SPEAKER_08]: And also they had the regular little demo thing that you go through.

167
00:11:43,776 --> 00:12:00,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, yeah, you know, it's alright, I guess, but once again, it's just kind of, you can tell how well it's gonna be just by looking at it in the videos and stuff, and it, right, for me, it plays okay, but...

168
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:03,144
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

169
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:30,109
[SPEAKER_08]: You can knock it off either side, but they wanted you to knock it off the left side because it's a lot easier to do it.

170
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:36,711
[SPEAKER_08]: So I ended up not knowing that, obviously, so I moved it to the right, trying to get it to fall off the edge of the thing.

171
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:42,334
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got it to the point where it's literally sitting on the edge, teetering, not quite moving off the edge.

172
00:12:42,614 --> 00:12:46,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm at the point where I'm, why do I have to knock it off the edge?

173
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:49,737
[SPEAKER_08]: There's clearly like 20 feet of space next to it that I could run by.

174
00:12:51,720 --> 00:13:00,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Since I'm a Jedi, I think I can be able to manage to fit my ego through that 20-foot patch of space there to get where I need to go.

175
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:05,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, I don't know, maybe because since my character can force jump anyways, I could have just hopped over the goddamn thing instead of knocking off the edge.

176
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:09,143
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, the game wants you to knock it over the edge before you can move on.

177
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:11,264
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm sitting there, like, pushing at it.

178
00:13:11,344 --> 00:13:13,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, tap, tap, tap, come on, get off the damn edge.

179
00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:16,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally got the tip over, and then I moved on.

180
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:16,885
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um...

181
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:18,814
[SPEAKER_08]: POD Racing POD Racing

182
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:37,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Parties and drunken nights

183
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:09,064
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like... I mean, it's kind of on rails, sort of.

184
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:13,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can dash towards things and you can dodge stuff.

185
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:16,149
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, all the gestures are very basic.

186
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:17,830
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's still very early.

187
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the game right now, it's probably not even in beta.

188
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:25,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, you know, July and the game's coming out in November.

189
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:28,757
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there's still plenty of time, you know, to polish it up.

190
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:29,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's playable.

191
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:31,058
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not terrible.

192
00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:31,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it...

193
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:34,200
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not something I would buy.

194
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,840
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's alright.

195
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,582
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just something that if someone likes The Force Unleashed or something like that, they're not probably going to get a lot out of this.

196
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say Josh was 11.

197
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:45,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you want to buy it then?

198
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:48,045
[SPEAKER_06]: He'd probably dig it.

199
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:49,825
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I'm thinking this is going to.

200
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:54,807
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very much for the same audience that kind of supported The Connect to begin with.

201
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:56,008
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't really the hardcore.

202
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:56,748
[SPEAKER_06]: It was more of the...

203
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,341
[SPEAKER_06]: LightSaber on!

204
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:18,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you still could say lightsaber on.

205
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I wouldn't.

206
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:20,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that would be terrible.

207
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:23,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it was okay.

208
00:15:23,786 --> 00:15:25,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Pod racing, though, I was slamming the walls.

209
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:26,167
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

210
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:29,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I blame that probably a little bit on myself because I didn't know how to control a damn thing.

211
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:40,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, I went through the tutorial for the single-player regular game portion, but the rep just put me straight into the game for the pod racing, and so...

212
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:44,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess there's dual throttles on that thing.

213
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:46,359
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was just like, full speed all the time.

214
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's not the greatest thing.

215
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:55,510
[SPEAKER_08]: But the game itself, the pod racing, it's very much like the movie.

216
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:56,731
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of cool.

217
00:15:56,892 --> 00:16:00,676
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they get the controls correct, it might not be that bad.

218
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:04,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have Greg Proops doing the announcing during the Star Wars sequence?

219
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:10,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'll tell you, a shout out to one of my other favorite podcasts, Smartest Man in the World with Greg Proops.

220
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:12,748
[SPEAKER_06]: He was in Star Wars Episode I narrating the pod races.

221
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:13,949
[SPEAKER_06]: He was one of the two heads on the dude.

222
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:14,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he is.

223
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:15,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Is he really?

224
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,130
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same voices.

225
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

226
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:18,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

227
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, that'll be cool.

228
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:23,393
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was all right.

229
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:29,295
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other game I saw was Skylanders, which is the new Spyro game.

230
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:36,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I was just sitting there with the two Activision reps and one of them I mentioned, I'm like, you know, it's like $70.

231
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, really, you think people are going to buy this, you know.

232
00:16:41,548 --> 00:17:11,217
[SPEAKER_08]: and they think that it's going to sell well I mean it's kind of neat I guess for kids because you can just pop this little toy on there and you know away you go and you can play as that character and they're going to have I guess 30 characters that you can play in the game but the thing is that kind of sucks you need certain characters to go access certain parts of the game like you know if you want to go underwater you can't use a fire monster you have to use something else so they kind of want you to buy the toys which are fucking expensive they're like 8 bucks each

233
00:17:11,537 --> 00:17:15,501
[SPEAKER_08]: and you know eight bucks for an action figure that's not so bad you know G.I.

234
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:31,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe's I used to buy those and that makes sense but these are like they're figurines they don't move they don't articulate at all they're just on you know not it's just mainly for the game it's like physical download content is basically what this is um

235
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:33,918
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's an experiment.

236
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:34,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess you'll be right.

237
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:43,287
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're a fan of Spyro and you really want to play a Spyro game, I would check this out as a demo or something first.

238
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:48,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, I will admit, I kind of got sick of Spyro.

239
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:50,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Spyro just kind of got oversaturated.

240
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:55,518
[SPEAKER_06]: But I haven't played a Spyro game in so long that I think back to the original one on PlayStation 1 very fondly.

241
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:56,458
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not like that.

242
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:56,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

243
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:04,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's like that in the world sense, but it's not... Spyro looks fucking angry in it.

244
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:06,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Spyro got more hardcore.

245
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,501
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, what the fuck did you do to my games?

246
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so fucking pissed!

247
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,942
[SPEAKER_08]: He just has this angry look on his face.

248
00:18:13,022 --> 00:18:14,823
[SPEAKER_08]: They made him emo-ragey.

249
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:16,123
[SPEAKER_06]: They're targeting a new audience.

250
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:17,803
[SPEAKER_06]: They're targeting angry people with money.

251
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:20,024
[SPEAKER_08]: It was alright.

252
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:23,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get to play Just Dance 3 because...

253
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I bet you're just torn up about that one.

254
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:30,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Just Dance 2 was pretty fun.

255
00:18:30,853 --> 00:18:31,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I played it.

256
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:36,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Is Just Dance 3 on all the consoles now, or is that just Wii?

257
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:45,821
[SPEAKER_08]: She was going to bring it on the Wii, bring a Wii dev kit because she had that, but unfortunately they had issues with syncing controllers or something.

258
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Ninja Gaiden 3 Ninja Gaiden 3

259
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:04,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Really violent.

260
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:06,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

261
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:14,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Because every time you slash through somebody and you cut people in half and stuff, it goes in really close.

262
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, they were saying that the theme this year was that they wanted to...

263
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:41,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I just convey the feeling of slicing somebody in half is what they're trying to go for alright I'm bringing up a YouTube here so I can try and see some of this here I'm just randomly finding a YouTube channel hoping there's no narration in the background here I don't want to hear this dude narrating let's see if we can find something else a little more

264
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:47,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't want to hear Adam Sessler narrating over this stuff

265
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:34,483
[SPEAKER_08]: and of course theirs is timing out well this segment's going nowhere live radio boys and girls I'll just have to take Loki's word for it it's a pretty awesome game granted though that the difficulty was ramped way down because it is a demo and they don't want everybody to fail on it but there is going to be like I guess some sort of casual gaming mode or like an easy mode or something you can play so but you know just really over the top fun game though alright was that it?

266
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:39,004
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah oh did Ninja Gaiden 3 make you want to go back and play the other ones?

267
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:41,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, no.

268
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:46,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Ninja Gaiden's not really a game I would think that I need to play the other ones, you know?

269
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:51,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you were to play Ninja Gaiden 3... Yeah, but if you like 3, you might as well go back and see what you missed in 1 and 2.

270
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:52,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, 1's, well...

271
00:20:53,755 --> 00:21:21,547
[SPEAKER_06]: obviously there's obviously there's the old old old what there's the Atari arcade game and then there were the Nintendo NES games by Tecmo and now you know you had this new trilogy that started I believe on Xbox was because Ninja Gaiden was a huge exclusive for the original Xbox you know then what Ninja Gaiden 2 was on I think 360 in that yeah well and they also have the PS3 once the Sigma series right right so you can always check that out

272
00:21:21,943 --> 00:21:36,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean... It's not really something I necessarily need to do, but... Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Doing Laundryman in our chatroom says, Chopping people in half?

273
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:38,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki finally gets to live one of his dreams.

274
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:48,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, speaking... Not really the chopping people in half thing, but I did remember there was a few other things that I didn't get to play, but stuff I learned, which is kind of cool.

275
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:48,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

276
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:49,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

277
00:21:51,164 --> 00:21:52,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row the Third.

278
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:56,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a little peek at, because, you know, I fucking love Saints Row.

279
00:21:56,976 --> 00:21:59,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, you're just eating that stuff up with a spoon.

280
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,663
[SPEAKER_06]: You are so excited.

281
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:01,926
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be there at midnight.

282
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,489
[SPEAKER_08]: No, a couple things about Saints Row the Third.

283
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:12,671
[SPEAKER_08]: One, I was looking at their, they had their kind of lineup of their advertising campaign.

284
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So everything they're doing up from now to launch.

285
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:22,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that's later on, not announced yet, is a new mode that they're going to have.

286
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:26,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, all the other games have their kind of horde mode and stuff like that.

287
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:29,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're going to have horde mode, as in whores.

288
00:22:30,177 --> 00:22:30,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

289
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:42,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically when you turn on horde mode, random prostitutes will attack you on the streets.

290
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:44,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

291
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:46,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just like, yes!

292
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:48,148
[SPEAKER_08]: This game is amazing.

293
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:50,330
[SPEAKER_06]: What game do I want to play today?

294
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I want to get attacked by prostitutes.

295
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:54,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Just armies of prostitutes.

296
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:56,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they yelling things at you?

297
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:56,794
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like...

298
00:22:58,923 --> 00:23:00,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but it's going to be awesome.

299
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:02,487
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's something they're going to be talking about.

300
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:11,556
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to have some sort of invite-only demo thing that my THQ rep says that they're going to try because I'm such a huge fan.

301
00:23:11,577 --> 00:23:12,758
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to try to get me into it.

302
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:14,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh God, if that would happen.

303
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:16,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what I would do.

304
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:20,846
[SPEAKER_06]: It almost sounds like you took that rep in the back alley and did what you had to do to get a sneak peek.

305
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:27,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm probably the biggest Spyro fan here and I'm glad the game is like the original.

306
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:28,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought the Legend series brought it down.

307
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:47,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see, Spazinator in our chatroom says, Agreed, I was just playing Ninja Gaiden 2 the other day.

308
00:23:48,004 --> 00:23:50,025
[SPEAKER_06]: The camera needs improvement, to put it mildly.

309
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:51,605
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

310
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:57,348
[SPEAKER_06]: And Actdeft is hearing you talking about Saints Row the 3rd saying, Best game ever, period.

311
00:23:57,408 --> 00:23:58,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on guys, the game's not out yet.

312
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:03,490
[SPEAKER_06]: What you don't want to do, do not hype the game beyond your expectations because you'll only set yourself up for disappointment.

313
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,491
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm just going to tell you guys now, Saints Row sucks.

314
00:24:06,932 --> 00:24:07,892
[SPEAKER_06]: It fucking blows.

315
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:09,733
[SPEAKER_06]: That way, if it's good, you'll be...

316
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:23,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Sonic Generations sounds like it's going to have a lot of fan service in it including I guess there's different things that you unlock by beating certain challenges in each level including some of the original games.

317
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:26,708
[SPEAKER_08]: You can unlock Sonic 1 in there and some other stuff.

318
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:27,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

319
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:28,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

320
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:28,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

321
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:31,229
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see, Sonic 1.

322
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:35,811
[SPEAKER_06]: How many times has that game been whored out in the past few years?

323
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we had the Sonic Mega Genesis collection.

324
00:24:39,132 --> 00:24:42,012
[SPEAKER_06]: You could pay 400 Microsoft points and get it that way.

325
00:24:42,653 --> 00:24:45,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's going to be an unlockable in another game.

326
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:49,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not counting when we saw it probably back on the GameCube and every other collection known to man.

327
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:53,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how many times are you going to pimp out Sonic?

328
00:24:53,956 --> 00:24:55,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Rising 2, The Way We Meant To Do It

329
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:20,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I love some of the random comments our chatters make sometimes.

330
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:31,387
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt in our chatroom says, I think in the Bizarro world, Bizarro Loki likes playing sports games, MMOs, enjoys eating steamed broccoli, and looking at tasteful porn.

331
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:35,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoyed MMOs and tasteful porn.

332
00:25:38,193 --> 00:25:39,294
[SPEAKER_06]: But fuck steamed broccoli.

333
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:40,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, fuck steamed broccoli.

334
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:41,776
[SPEAKER_08]: That's disgusting.

335
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,632
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, moving on, My Gaming Week.

336
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:46,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a whole lot of new stuff.

337
00:25:46,473 --> 00:25:49,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I've kind of been focusing on many of the games I already have.

338
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:52,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing those, including, of course, WoW.

339
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:53,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Been revisiting some old stuff.

340
00:25:54,017 --> 00:26:01,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I was randomly playing some Super Street Fighter IV this week, as well as Wipeout HD, which I finally looked at the Fury expansion, what, like two years later?

341
00:26:01,782 --> 00:26:02,682
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, well, since...

342
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:06,764
[SPEAKER_06]: In my household, there's two of us and we share a PlayStation 3.

343
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:10,625
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got two of the games and the Salacious Pop got two other games.

344
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So he got the Wipeout with Fury in it.

345
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:13,806
[SPEAKER_06]: So that.

346
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:17,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played the Bomberman game because it's free on PlayStation Plus right now.

347
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:22,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And since I didn't cash in the PlayStation Plus until right at the end, I'm still on it.

348
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:24,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So Bomberman's free right now.

349
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:26,369
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played that and it's...

350
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:33,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Bomberman was great in 95, and now it's something that's better left in my memory.

351
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot I signed up for PlayStation Plus.

352
00:26:35,692 --> 00:26:36,653
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some free games.

353
00:26:36,933 --> 00:26:37,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't miss anything.

354
00:26:37,753 --> 00:26:41,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Go get some trophies or something.

355
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Free until the 3rd or whenever it wears out, I know.

356
00:26:44,976 --> 00:27:02,883
[SPEAKER_06]: you can check that out also as far as other games I've been playing that are a little bit newer I talked about Bastion last week I said I'd only played the demo I did end up upgrading to the full version and I'm glad I did I'm still enjoying Bastion some things that didn't show up in the demo there's another weapon that I really like like a sword weapon that you can throw

357
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:03,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

358
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:20,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

359
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:45,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I also checked out From Dust.

360
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:47,056
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a demo.

361
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:49,319
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, these are impressions based on a demo.

362
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I had heard it was like the old games Populous, which I loved that game back in the day.

363
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:57,808
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was all about ready to try this.

364
00:27:57,908 --> 00:28:00,751
[SPEAKER_06]: And I checked out the demo and it's very...

365
00:28:03,654 --> 00:28:07,075
[SPEAKER_06]: The way it's presented, the presentation of the game is great.

366
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:10,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, everything is very gorgeous.

367
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:12,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is well done in the way it's put together.

368
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,859
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt like a disc-based game, honestly.

369
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:19,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really surprised they packed all this into an arcade release, although I think it was like a gig download.

370
00:28:19,822 --> 00:28:25,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, and some 360 games are like several hundred megs, so this is almost as big as a disc game.

371
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:37,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say where I got frustrated though is that I honestly found the demo, I couldn't really get past one of the stages in the demo and I found it really frustrating because the way I was laying down the sand or something was just not right.

372
00:28:37,588 --> 00:28:44,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean maybe I just need to approach it again with a clear head but it was one of those points of early frustration where I'm like well shit if I can't beat the demo then...

373
00:28:44,614 --> 00:29:09,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't wasting my money on the full game but I liked where it was going so I can't really say it reflects on the game negatively I think it's just one of those try this for yourself because it's something you have to experience but it's not really for everybody so that's the beautiful thing about arcade there's demos of every game so if you like those types of games like Populous I'm trying to think what else maybe Lemmings-esque

374
00:29:10,478 --> 00:29:12,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of reminded of that a little bit.

375
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:13,779
[SPEAKER_06]: You might enjoy this game.

376
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:16,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out.

377
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,441
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really otherwise about it.

378
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:21,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get my classic game on next weekend.

379
00:29:22,082 --> 00:29:29,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking to SalaciousPop about wanting to hook up the Dreamcast to play the NES emulator to go play some old games.

380
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So I might do some of that this weekend.

381
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:32,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot a game I played this week.

382
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:34,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.

383
00:29:34,527 --> 00:29:35,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh.

384
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:36,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

385
00:29:37,184 --> 00:29:37,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Old school.

386
00:29:38,004 --> 00:29:39,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Where the hell did that come from?

387
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:40,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't that on Sega CD?

388
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:42,366
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there was a version on Sega CD.

389
00:29:42,386 --> 00:29:44,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there was a version on Genesis, though.

390
00:29:44,387 --> 00:29:46,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I played it on my arcade cabinet.

391
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:48,849
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fun.

392
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:49,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

393
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:56,032
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to play a beat-em-up game that wasn't Ninja Turtles or something I'd played before.

394
00:29:56,192 --> 00:29:57,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs it was.

395
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,835
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a character in there that looks just like Blanka, except he has a tail and weird eyes.

396
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:04,875
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, Rob.

397
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:05,256
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

398
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:07,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't we give you an S?

399
00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:08,257
[SPEAKER_06]: You did.

400
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:09,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

401
00:30:09,338 --> 00:30:10,499
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't have a lot of carts.

402
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:11,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some.

403
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I can, I was going to say, I'd be more than happy to do some games.

404
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:15,222
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see, we'll see.

405
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:17,723
[SPEAKER_10]: So that you can have the excitement of blowing into the cartridges.

406
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:18,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

407
00:30:18,304 --> 00:30:19,765
[SPEAKER_10]: And then into the machine and then swapping them.

408
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:22,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to our chat room at chat.org.

409
00:30:22,226 --> 00:30:23,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Some comments from our chat.

410
00:30:23,327 --> 00:30:28,210
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf, the man before us Sunday nights at all games, is in chat saying, Sky, take out the narrator.

411
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Bastion still worth it?

412
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:40,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but keep in mind, you know, every gamer's a little different, and I really like these isometric, platformy type of games.

413
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:50,977
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, some of my favorite games going back to the NES and Super NES era are Solstice and Equinox and that series, and this game, to me, really kind of harkens back to those games.

414
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:54,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's the sole motivator, but it just makes a good thing better.

415
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:55,506
[SPEAKER_06]: If that makes sense.

416
00:31:18,534 --> 00:31:21,057
[SPEAKER_08]: If only they had that narrator in Saints Row the Third.

417
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:26,745
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he decided to stand there and flip off the prostitute.

418
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:30,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Derek H in the chat says, From Dust is great.

419
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll admit, I probably didn't give it a fair chance.

420
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:37,504
[SPEAKER_06]: It was late last night and I just kind of got fed up and I was like, I'm just going to go back to Street Fighter.

421
00:31:37,524 --> 00:31:39,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck this.

422
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:50,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to approach it again a little later on because I refuse to believe that I wouldn't really get more out of this game considering I really used to like the SimCity, the Populous, and those types of games back in the day.

423
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:53,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep saying Populous because that's the one I am really reminded of.

424
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:57,438
[SPEAKER_06]: This really does feel like just an all-new version of that game.

425
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:00,859
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, moving on.

426
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,041
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it for our gaming weeks.

427
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:06,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's move on to some housekeeping tonight, of which we don't have a whole lot.

428
00:32:07,703 --> 00:32:10,504
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have every show planned for the month.

429
00:32:10,544 --> 00:32:12,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we have any shows planned off.

430
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:16,627
[SPEAKER_06]: There might be one at the end of August, because I'm going to be gone at the end of August, but that's a ways off.

431
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:22,790
[SPEAKER_06]: You are not going on any trips after all, so we'll be having shows for the foreseeable future, for at least the next four weeks.

432
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be lonely.

433
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:25,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nonsense.

434
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:27,106
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you have MMOs.

435
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:28,067
[SPEAKER_06]: You're never lonely.

436
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:30,248
[SPEAKER_06]: You will not be forever alone.

437
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:33,609
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

438
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:34,229
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

439
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:39,132
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're feeling forever alone, DarkSakura, you should just hop into our chat room during the week and say, Iken has hug.

440
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,772
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's people in there throughout the week.

441
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,653
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll just say, hugs.

442
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:42,793
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

443
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:43,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

444
00:32:43,954 --> 00:32:46,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I challenge you to do that twice this week.

445
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

446
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:48,036
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

447

[SPEAKER_06]: Alright Otherwise visit our website www.orangeloungeradio.com Of course you can always visit us on Twitter Twitter.com slash OLR If you have comments on the show as it's going tonight And you're not in the chat You can always send us a tweet And we'll get to some of your tweets later on in the program So twitter.com slash OLR for that Of course we are on Facebook as well Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio We're on Tumblr now I don't think we've been posting a lot there But it's there OrangeLoungeRadio.tumblr.com Right?

448
00:33:15,163 --> 00:33:15,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?

449
00:33:16,024 --> 00:33:16,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio?

450
00:33:16,564 --> 00:33:17,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah it's there

451
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:17,783
[SPEAKER_06]: It's new.

452
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:19,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know all the stuff now.

453
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:20,264
[SPEAKER_06]: It's new.

454
00:33:20,504 --> 00:33:20,904
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

455
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:23,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we finally delete the MySpace?

456
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:23,745
[SPEAKER_06]: We might have.

457
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:24,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's gone.

458
00:33:24,606 --> 00:33:27,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the MySpace is just rotting.

459
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:30,368
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be just an archive of old, old, old-ass clips from the to-go edition.

460
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:34,049
[SPEAKER_10]: We may as well just leave it there, like some treasure fossil.

461
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:34,550
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

462
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,110
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

463
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,511
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be like something you discover in From Dusk.

464
00:33:38,531 --> 00:33:40,192
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like doing archaeology in WoW.

465
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:55,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's move on to some gaming news and obviously the blogosphere has been blowing up this week with chat on a few topics and I know you're all dying to know what Loki thinks of some of this stuff.

466
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:57,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm dying to know what you guys think of some of this stuff in our chat room.

467
00:33:58,258 --> 00:33:58,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to it.

468
00:33:58,998 --> 00:34:01,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, will you please do the honors of starting us off with the big news this week?

469
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:06,732
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so Nintendo hasn't been doing that great with the 3DS.

470
00:34:07,552 --> 00:34:17,935
[SPEAKER_08]: They cut their profits forecast by 82%, basically dropping their estimated profit from 20 billion yen, or about $257 million, to 110 billion yen, or about 1.41 billion, I guess.

471
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:18,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, I'm sorry...

472
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:36,654
[SPEAKER_08]: They dropped it down to 20 billion yen from 110 billion yen.

473
00:34:37,014 --> 00:34:38,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is quite a drop.

474
00:34:39,436 --> 00:34:55,669
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, basing it on the fact that they're saying that the stronger than expected yen appreciation and sales performance of the 3DS hardware in sales outlook for the holiday season.

475
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:55,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

476
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:08,717
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're going to be dropping the price, of course, of the 3DS on August 12th to $170 from its $250 mark right now.

477
00:35:09,797 --> 00:35:16,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess something similar is going to happen effective August 11th in Japan, dropping the system from 25,000 yen to 15,000 yen.

478
00:35:21,656 --> 00:35:28,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, there's no price yet in Europe, but I'm sure they're going to get some sort of drop.

479
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:36,510
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, if you're having a little bit of buyer's remorse because you bought a launch system and you're like, what the fuck, you know, $80 now.

480
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:38,451
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I going to do?

481
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:41,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Nintendo is actually going to give you some free games.

482
00:35:42,713 --> 00:35:54,597
[SPEAKER_08]: They said basically anybody that signs into Nintendo's eShop before August 12th will be signed up automatically to the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program.

483
00:35:55,397 --> 00:36:22,306
[SPEAKER_08]: and basically you get 10 free NES Virtual Console games on September 1st and I guess it's before the release of the games for everybody else and also some Game Boy Advance games also that's kind of their way of saying hey we're going to have an NES Virtual Console system on the 3DS and also going to offer Game Boy Advance games since this has never been mentioned prior to this um

484
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:27,150
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, in some of the games that they're giving away, I mean, they're not half bad, actually.

485
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,213
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, you know, like The Legend of Zelda, Balloon Fight, Ice Climber.

486
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:32,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, they're seeing some Game Boy Advance games.

487
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:40,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Yoshi's Island, Super Mario Advance 3, Mario Kart, Metroid Fusion, WarioWare, Mario vs. Donkey Kong.

488
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:44,527
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, quite a few things.

489
00:36:45,408 --> 00:36:45,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

490
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:51,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I guess... Let's stop there before we get to some of the other stuff.

491
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:53,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to dissect this a little bit because I've got to admit, when did this all come down?

492
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:56,293
[SPEAKER_06]: It was probably Wednesday or so when this was all announced.

493
00:36:56,874 --> 00:37:04,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got to admit, I was reading the updates through Twitter and so forth and through my Google Reader and I was like...

494
00:37:05,243 --> 00:37:07,023
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is going on today?

495
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:09,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I've stepped into Bizarro World.

496
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:11,964
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened at Nintendo?

497
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:14,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, something huge went down there.

498
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:19,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is just... Does this even feel like the same Nintendo from just a couple months ago?

499
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:21,106
[SPEAKER_06]: This screams of desperation.

500
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:29,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and when I told Salacious Pop about it, and I think he put it best, he said, Wow, Nintendo just totally ate shit.

501
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:32,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And they really did.

502
00:37:33,149 --> 00:37:33,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Like...

503
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:45,036
[SPEAKER_06]: What... I mean, clearly the 3DS not performing up to expectations, and there's been a lot of flack on that, but I honestly didn't see this coming.

504
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's so much about this that's just out of character.

505
00:37:47,817 --> 00:37:50,218
[SPEAKER_06]: A, they didn't announce a price drop today.

506
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:52,899
[SPEAKER_06]: They announced a price drop a few weeks from now.

507
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:58,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's usually not what you want to do, because that's kind of suicide to your sales right away.

508
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:01,442
[SPEAKER_06]: But then B, they turn around and announce this program with...

509
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:04,143
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 free games?

510
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:04,143
20?

511
00:38:06,543 --> 00:38:09,364
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not... Nintendo?

512
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:12,325
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not something I would have ever expected out of Nintendo.

513
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:16,246
[SPEAKER_10]: But it gives people incentive to buy the system at full price to get the freebies.

514
00:38:16,306 --> 00:38:19,206
[SPEAKER_06]: It does, and I see that perspective of it, but I still don't get it.

515
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:24,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't get it being Nintendo, because I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

516
00:38:24,488 --> 00:38:25,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have expected Nintendo to be like,

517
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:38,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, you know, well, we're going to cut the price and, you know, we're going to give you some free Club Nintendo points or we're going to let you have Mario Brothers 2 early or something.

518
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not expecting 20 games.

519
00:38:42,183 --> 00:38:47,328
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a huge, like, in my opinion, is a huge admission of something on Nintendo.

520
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:48,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, we didn't just fuck up.

521
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,611
[SPEAKER_06]: We fucked up big.

522
00:38:51,023 --> 00:38:52,645
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's surprising about it to me.

523
00:38:53,325 --> 00:38:59,970
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, to be fair, I realize that if I buy something early, like a 3DS, it's very likely to get a price cut in the future.

524
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:08,116
[SPEAKER_06]: If they had announced a price drop and they said, oh, you only get a Mario game, I would have been like, okay, well, you know, that's the price you pay for getting shit early.

525
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:12,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki imported a 3DS and paid a premium to have it like a couple weeks early.

526
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,161
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just what we do sometimes because we're sick.

527
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:17,063
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to have the newest gadgets early.

528
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:18,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have been perfectly fine with it.

529
00:39:19,144 --> 00:39:26,911
[SPEAKER_06]: But now to hear there's like 20 free games coming out, now I'm not just like, oh, I'm not unhappy about this price drop.

530
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:29,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm like, fuck, I'm really glad I bought one early.

531
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at the games they're talking about on the Game Boy Advance.

532
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:39,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Metroid, Yoshi's Island, these are like... Metroid Fusion's fucking awesome.

533
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:39,521
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not...

534
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:45,485
[SPEAKER_06]: There might be like half and half, half crap, half triple A titles.

535
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:46,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have a point though to make.

536
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:47,106
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

537
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:48,967
[SPEAKER_10]: We're glad that we didn't get one.

538
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Because first of all, all of those games that are worth having, I already own.

539
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought them on my old system.

540
00:39:57,132 --> 00:39:59,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Second, we're not going to spend as much money.

541
00:40:00,322 --> 00:40:04,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but hold that thought because, Loki, you gotta read this next bit then on this.

542
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:08,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're dying to give your impressions too, Loki, but I'm gonna make the listeners wait a minute.

543
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:13,435
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Loki, read this next story because here's where things get real fucking interesting real quick.

544
00:40:14,256 --> 00:40:18,040
[SPEAKER_08]: 3DS NES games will also include multiplayer following an update.

545
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you'll be able to play those virtual console games.

546
00:40:23,926 --> 00:40:25,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess with other people now.

547
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:29,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if that's over the internet or if that's just locally, but that's kind of interesting.

548
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,172
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's the list of NES games that they've announced.

549
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:38,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong Jr., Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, and The Legend of Zelda.

550
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,837
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, five other unknown games right now.

551
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:51,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they added multiplayer into Virtual Console, and we don't know yet, but this possibly could be over the internet.

552
00:40:53,175 --> 00:40:55,897
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing what they should have done with the Wii five years ago?

553
00:40:56,977 --> 00:40:57,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally?

554
00:40:57,918 --> 00:41:05,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that makes these games a lot more... I mean, because let's face it, Nintendo is kind of sucker-punching us a little bit here.

555
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:12,526
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't early adopt the 3DS and you do want to get these games, and let's say they do end up being multiplayer over the internet, you're going to have to buy them again.

556
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:15,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you bought them for five bucks the first time on the Wii, you're going to have to buy them again.

557
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:21,750
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the early adopters, now you're kind of in this, well, I can't really get mad because I'm still going to get it for free.

558
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,891
[SPEAKER_06]: But DarkSakura, let's say the multiplayer thing pans out.

559
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:27,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say it ends up that you can play it on the internet.

560
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:28,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Now does that change your opinion?

561
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:31,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Or are you still like, no, at the end of the day, I'm saving 80 bucks.

562
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:32,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care about multiplayer.

563
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:34,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I really don't.

564
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:37,456
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's just okay good.

565
00:41:37,736 --> 00:41:38,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad for other people.

566
00:41:39,217 --> 00:41:39,738
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't care.

567
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:41,158
[SPEAKER_10]: That's me.

568
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:42,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

569
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:43,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

570
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind how few times I've done any multiplayer game on Xbox Live.

571
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:56,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Or I think the last multiplayer game I've played that involved a Nintendo system was playing Super Mario Brothers.

572
00:41:57,228 --> 00:42:09,985
[SPEAKER_10]: and then that I didn't really like it with the multiplayer aspect so because I was just like stop being stupid just let me play by myself you know I was just getting annoyed so I do not play well with others

573
00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:17,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I want to emphasize, we don't know for sure yet if multiplayer means multiplayer on the internet.

574
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:30,764
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all forming a prayer circle right now that, for those of us that are into multiplayer, we're all forming a prayer circle that Nintendo's going to do the right thing, and they are going to open up the internet, because if the emulation scene's been able to do it for years, there's no reason Nintendo cannot open these games to play on the internet.

575
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:38,227
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we should only expect that multiplayer means within the same room, which is still interesting...

576
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:40,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

577
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:48,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I would repay $5 for these games for that alone, but if Nintendo's going to hand them to me for free, I'm not exactly going to bash them.

578
00:42:49,185 --> 00:42:49,786
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

579
00:42:51,186 --> 00:42:52,907
[SPEAKER_08]: And then here's another interesting thing.

580
00:42:53,007 --> 00:43:04,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently Satori Iwata, he's gone ahead and taken a 50% reduction in pay as a result of the 3DS's slow sales.

581
00:43:04,773 --> 00:43:05,073
[SPEAKER_06]: What?!

582
00:43:06,154 --> 00:43:07,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Who are you people?!

583
00:43:07,315 --> 00:43:09,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo, I don't even know you anymore!

584
00:43:09,816 --> 00:43:11,397
[SPEAKER_06]: You're taking pay cuts now?!

585
00:43:13,498 --> 00:43:29,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Other representative directors, including senior managing directors Miyamoto and Shinji Hatano are taking a 30% pay cut and other executives will lose 20% off their salaries.

586
00:43:30,588 --> 00:43:33,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you anything that will not happen to Nintendo U.S.,

587
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they said Reggie's one of the affected people, right?

588
00:43:37,568 --> 00:43:38,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no.

589
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:39,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.

590
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:40,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't pick up on that.

591
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:46,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Doing something like that is honestly... It is the corporate equivalent of falling on your sword.

592
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:48,614
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very much a Japanese thing.

593
00:43:49,055 --> 00:43:49,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

594
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:54,598
[SPEAKER_10]: To take responsibility for the sake of the whole company.

595
00:43:55,888 --> 00:43:57,329
[SPEAKER_06]: If only Congress would do that.

596
00:43:57,449 --> 00:43:58,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

597
00:43:59,911 --> 00:44:11,100
[SPEAKER_06]: In the scope of a week, we've gone from kicking Nintendo, fuck you Nintendo, Operation Rainfall for life, fuck you, I hate you too, oh my god, Congress needs to look at what Nintendo's doing.

598
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:13,682
[SPEAKER_10]: This all happened in a week.

599
00:44:14,302 --> 00:44:14,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

600
00:44:16,044 --> 00:44:20,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, every politician needs to take a look at what Nintendo's doing.

601
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

602
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:38,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we start talking about what Congress needs to start emulating from Nintendo, we're still not over the fact that they botched all this stuff up with the Wii and all the online and not bringing games over and whatnot.

603
00:44:39,129 --> 00:44:40,970
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is a very effective diversion.

604
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me put it this way.

605
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:46,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony, they made a multi-million dollar...

606
00:44:48,574 --> 00:44:53,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Error, if you will, in their online security, and I got two games for it.

607
00:44:54,698 --> 00:44:57,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo, to make up for dropping... You got four games.

608
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,862
[SPEAKER_06]: You know you work the system, just like the rest of us did with the multi-accounts.

609
00:45:02,464 --> 00:45:09,788
[SPEAKER_08]: To be fair, you got two PS3 games, two PSP games... I did not actually do it on my other... Alright, well, whatever.

610
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:10,629
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

611
00:45:10,889 --> 00:45:12,030
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

612
00:45:13,331 --> 00:45:15,512
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, we get... Okay, four games.

613
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:15,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

614
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:17,934
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

615
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:33,482
[SPEAKER_08]: or our 20 free games.

616
00:45:34,402 --> 00:45:35,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Now here's the best part.

617
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:37,844
[SPEAKER_08]: If you really want to game the system, here's what you do.

618
00:45:38,624 --> 00:45:45,828
[SPEAKER_08]: You go to a Best Buy or a Walmart or something like that just before August 12th.

619
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:48,529
[SPEAKER_08]: You buy a system for the full price.

620
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:55,073
[SPEAKER_08]: You log it onto Nintendo's network and then when it drops the price two days later, you come in and go, what the hell?

621
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:56,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Why this drop in price?

622
00:45:56,774 --> 00:45:58,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a refund.

623
00:45:58,415 --> 00:46:01,077
[SPEAKER_08]: And they will refund you the difference in price.

624
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:09,283
[SPEAKER_06]: If these companies are smart, which I'm not saying they are, but if they're smart, they're going to put an exemption to their policy like just a couple weeks before.

625
00:46:09,923 --> 00:46:10,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch.

626
00:46:10,964 --> 00:46:12,705
[SPEAKER_06]: At least one of these stores is going to do that.

627
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:16,628
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to say 3DS accepted from the policy from X to Y day.

628
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:23,793
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to wait until right that first day that the refund... If it's like a 21-day window, they'll wait until... Well, I guess we would be in that window, but...

629
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:29,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the windows are depending on what store you shop at, but I bet some of them are going to throw up an exception.

630
00:46:29,802 --> 00:46:34,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not something as huge as Walmart, but I bet you some of these other stores will.

631
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:39,257
[SPEAKER_08]: At the very least, if those games are interesting to you.

632
00:46:39,837 --> 00:46:40,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

633
00:47:03,283 --> 00:47:29,547
[SPEAKER_06]: So Loki, sometimes your thoughts on Nintendo really confuse the hell out of me because you imported a 3DS from Japan just so you could have it before anybody else and you were an early adopter of Nintendo and I know you were an early adopter of Wii as well but then Nintendo does things that really piss you off and you've screamed and you've yelled at them here on the show so surely you must have seen the news this week and gone, what is this?

634
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:30,228
[SPEAKER_06]: What is going on?

635
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:32,848
[SPEAKER_06]: What was your reaction to all the news this week and where are you at now?

636
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:35,958
[SPEAKER_08]: My reaction was like, wow, I'm surprised they're dropping it this early.

637
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:41,123
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I guess that's an admission that it's not selling well, which we all knew.

638
00:47:41,863 --> 00:47:44,946
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I wasn't angry about it.

639
00:47:45,286 --> 00:47:48,909
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing about these 20 free games is that it's kind of cool.

640
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:55,935
[SPEAKER_08]: At least I'll have something that I can put on my memory card that I can play because I'm not fucking buying any of those virtual console games.

641
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:58,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not paying money for that kind of stuff.

642
00:47:58,137 --> 00:47:58,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell no.

643
00:47:59,478 --> 00:47:59,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

644
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:03,281
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's kind of cool that I'll have something to fill up my memory card with.

645
00:48:03,741 --> 00:48:09,984
[SPEAKER_08]: But, at the same time, you know, dropping the price of the system doesn't make any of the good games come out any sooner.

646
00:48:10,644 --> 00:48:15,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because, you know, what, they announced a couple games, you know, out this year.

647
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:18,308
[SPEAKER_08]: A new Mario, a Mario Kart, and stuff like that.

648
00:48:18,368 --> 00:48:23,491
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, I've seen the videos of Mario Kart, and I was just kind of, eh.

649
00:48:23,691 --> 00:48:25,472
[SPEAKER_08]: They added hang gliders in underwater.

650
00:48:25,832 --> 00:48:27,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Big fucking deal.

651
00:48:27,513 --> 00:48:29,354
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's not that exciting.

652
00:48:29,694 --> 00:48:29,894
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

653
00:48:32,498 --> 00:48:39,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have something to download for free but it's definitely not going to get me to buy more things and it's definitely not going to get me to buy crappy games that are out there now.

654
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:45,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I'll have a use to dust off my system.

655
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was looking at it sitting on the coffee table, not being charged or anything, just sitting there.

656
00:48:50,912 --> 00:48:53,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, well, I don't know.

657
00:48:54,233 --> 00:48:56,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.

658
00:48:56,374 --> 00:48:59,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Technus in our chatroom says, right, Nintendo running America.

659
00:48:59,235 --> 00:49:02,377
[SPEAKER_06]: That means they will just rehash the same laws and not make new ones.

660
00:49:02,897 --> 00:49:04,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that kind of what's happening now?

661
00:49:04,238 --> 00:49:05,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Like nobody wants to do something different?

662
00:49:05,978 --> 00:49:07,339
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we're at right now.

663
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:09,680
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to get controversial.

664
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Salacious Pop in our chat says, what I want to know is, will DSi XL get a price drop too now?

665
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:20,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting that that is completely absent, but I would think logically it has to, right?

666
00:49:20,603 --> 00:49:22,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Because isn't the DSi XL right now $179?

667
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

668
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought they've already dropped the price of that stuff.

669
00:49:26,184 --> 00:49:27,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they did the regular DS.

670
00:49:27,824 --> 00:49:38,327
[SPEAKER_06]: But even, I mean, logically, if the 3DS is coming down that low, XL and the rest of them, if they're not fading into obscurity altogether, are going to have to get some type of price cut.

671
00:49:38,427 --> 00:49:41,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, XL ought to come down to $129, if not less.

672
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:44,009
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I don't know.

673
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:51,772
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a part of me that kind of thinks like, well, why wouldn't Nintendo just get rid of all the old DSs altogether and say, buy a 3DS or get GTFO?

674
00:49:52,893 --> 00:49:54,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and could you really blame them for doing that?

675
00:49:55,214 --> 00:49:58,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you would still have the current inventory on shelves now.

676
00:49:58,715 --> 00:50:02,977
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get their prices slashed to get it off the shelves and make room for more 3DSs, but...

677
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:05,555
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

678
00:50:22,071 --> 00:50:22,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo 3DS Launch Lineup

679
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:43,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

680
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:44,492
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I'm coming from.

681
00:50:44,592 --> 00:50:51,039
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm reading things on the internet that are like, oh, Sony was ready to give Nintendo Rumble and stuff.

682
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,925
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not trying to hate on the Vita, but I also don't see where it's in much better of a position right now.

683
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:59,689
[SPEAKER_08]: All the announced titles that they've got coming out right now aren't that exciting.

684
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:01,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Uncharted.

685
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:03,594
[SPEAKER_06]: That's their one big, huge thing they got.

686
00:51:04,366 --> 00:51:22,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the other ones, like, I could give... I couldn't give a crap about whatever the hell that game, the puzzle game is, where they're, like, really showing off the back-touch stuff, or... You know, I don't need another fucking rehash of goddamn, you know, uh... Was it, uh... Well, LittleBigPlanet, for one.

687
00:51:22,154 --> 00:51:23,255
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yeah, great.

688
00:51:23,355 --> 00:51:24,515
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, LittleBigPlanet's coming out.

689
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:25,215
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

690
00:51:27,016 --> 00:51:27,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

691
00:51:27,596 --> 00:51:28,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't care.

692
00:51:46,161 --> 00:52:10,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's I just think, you know, and don't get me wrong I want a Vita, I'm gonna buy a Vita at launch, I will, I mean, I just I'm a techno person, I have to have it all, but and there are a couple games on Vita I do want, there was that one music game that Miklatov was talking about on one of the E3 specials that I want to get, and then there's that dungeon game that probably won't be out at launch but I know down the road I'll want to get that

693
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,004
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

694
00:52:26,258 --> 00:52:28,099
[SPEAKER_06]: What won Christmas five years ago?

695
00:52:28,339 --> 00:52:28,860
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii.

696
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,981
[SPEAKER_06]: What won Christmas last year?

697
00:52:31,061 --> 00:52:31,721
[SPEAKER_06]: The Kinect.

698
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:33,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Who was the target audience of both of those?

699
00:52:34,163 --> 00:52:35,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Oprah Watchers.

700
00:52:36,104 --> 00:52:38,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be the same story this year.

701
00:52:38,925 --> 00:52:49,611
[SPEAKER_06]: The performance from March to now isn't really going to matter when it comes to the holidays and all the kids everywhere want the 3DS to play Mario and watch 3D movies on.

702
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:50,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the 3DS...

703
00:52:51,112 --> 00:52:56,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of has a lot going for it And I gotta think also that some people Well, a lot of people probably thought Hey, you know what?

704
00:52:57,056 --> 00:53:12,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo's probably gonna drop the price of the 3DS Before holiday Because, you know, it's not doing that well Or, I mean, even if it was doing alright They still wanna, you know, incentivize people for, you know, buying the system I mean, I think a lot of people are like Well, you know what?

705
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:17,730
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not a lot of good games out right now I'm just gonna wait And waiting paid off for ya

706
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:22,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, imagine you're a soccer mom.

707
00:53:22,254 --> 00:53:24,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I know, just hear me out here for a minute.

708
00:53:24,275 --> 00:53:27,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine you're a soccer mom and you don't know anything about games.

709
00:53:28,157 --> 00:53:33,239
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know there's this one system that's $250 that I guess does some type of back touch thing.

710
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,481
[SPEAKER_06]: But then there's this other system over here that's $80 less and it does 3D.

711
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:39,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario.

712
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has Mario on it.

713
00:53:42,364 --> 00:53:45,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Which you remember some of your friends liking when you were in junior high school.

714
00:53:46,693 --> 00:53:48,974
[SPEAKER_06]: which is where the soccer moms are at now, right?

715
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:53,957
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, like, I'm not trying to, again, I'm not trying to knock the Vita.

716
00:53:54,057 --> 00:54:00,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be huge with the college crowd and the young 20s and, you know, more adult gamers, if you will.

717
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,901
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll still be huge with them and the fact that it's a, you know, all-in-one in the pocket.

718
00:54:03,921 --> 00:54:12,586
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think when it comes down to the actual sales, I think what shows up under those Christmas trees and Hanukkah menorahs and so forth are going to be 3DSs.

719
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:14,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you put your presents under the menorah?

720
00:54:15,287 --> 00:54:15,767
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

721
00:54:40,908 --> 00:54:43,730
[SPEAKER_10]: I get you guys presents because I know that you celebrate Christmas.

722
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know.

723
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,071
[SPEAKER_10]: And I like presents because I'm greedy.

724
00:54:47,892 --> 00:54:48,532
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

725
00:54:48,792 --> 00:54:49,373
[SPEAKER_10]: And special.

726
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:51,914
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

727
00:54:51,974 --> 00:54:52,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to our chat room.

728
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Laha in the chat room says, I think the parents didn't like the 3D.

729
00:54:57,057 --> 00:54:59,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Something about not wanting to mess up their kids' eyes.

730
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:01,939
[SPEAKER_06]: But what about, okay, look at the movies.

731
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Smurfs 3D is like top of the box office.

732
00:55:05,441 --> 00:55:06,982
[SPEAKER_06]: 3D really bugs my eyes.

733
00:55:07,462 --> 00:55:09,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate looking at the world in 3D.

734
00:55:09,864 --> 00:55:11,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It really hurts my eye.

735
00:55:11,885 --> 00:55:13,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I will tell you something.

736
00:55:13,426 --> 00:55:14,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what Laha's referring to.

737
00:55:14,807 --> 00:55:17,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It's those studies about the kids' eyes and so forth.

738
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:20,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, the 3DS itself is not true 3D.

739
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,571
[SPEAKER_10]: It's lenticular.

740
00:55:22,431 --> 00:55:25,353
[SPEAKER_10]: And that can cause some issues with vision.

741
00:55:25,753 --> 00:55:27,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it gives me a headache.

742
00:55:27,394 --> 00:55:29,935
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't play a 3DS for very long without getting a headache.

743
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:33,818
[SPEAKER_06]: The first day it gave me a headache, but now it's fine.

744
00:55:35,357 --> 00:55:57,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Bridge Racer was unplayable it was just completely unplayable I've actually been using the 3DS a little bit as a Netflix device like it's kind of nice to just have it like you know when you're like lying in bed but you're not really ready to go to sleep like it's kind of nice to just be able to you know have the thing there to watch Netflix funny enough I have an iPhone which I could use but I don't know usually that's on the charger so the 3DS just kind of works

745
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:01,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know, I guess they do have a point with the 3D thing.

746
00:56:01,876 --> 00:56:04,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's really gonna torpedo their sales.

747
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:08,223
[SPEAKER_08]: If only they had the forethought to, you know, put in a slider or something to turn the 3D off.

748
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:10,846
[SPEAKER_08]: If only.

749
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Nintendo, maybe next time.

750
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:14,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

751
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:42,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And TigerClawInChat is correcting me saying Smurfs and Cowboy and Aliens are sharing the number one spot this week But the reason why the Smurfs is even tied in the first place is that it has those extra 3D ticket sales Because let's face it, no one over the age of 11 wanted to see the Smurfs movie I still want to see Cowboys and Aliens I'm very torn about the Smurfs movie because I really like Neil Patrick Harris But I really hate everything else about that movie

752
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:48,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Hank Azaria and he's Gargamel, but I am not fucking sitting through that movie.

753
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:48,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

754
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:50,945
[SPEAKER_10]: He does, however, look just like freaking Gargamel, doesn't he?

755
00:56:51,706 --> 00:56:52,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I will give you that.

756
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:54,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we talking about the Smurfs movie?

757
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck this conversation.

758
00:56:57,662 --> 00:56:58,583
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what, though?

759
00:56:58,603 --> 00:57:02,987
[SPEAKER_08]: The Muppets movie, there's a lot of the cast from How I Met Your Mother.

760
00:57:03,027 --> 00:57:04,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yes to the Muppets movie.

761
00:57:05,049 --> 00:57:05,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait.

762
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:07,492
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be amazing.

763
00:57:07,832 --> 00:57:09,174
[SPEAKER_06]: 100% yes to the Muppets movie.

764
00:57:09,454 --> 00:57:10,715
[SPEAKER_06]: 100% no to the Smurfs movie.

765
00:57:11,176 --> 00:57:12,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Smurfs is terrible.

766
00:57:13,398 --> 00:57:14,118
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is terrible?

767
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:14,379
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

768
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:15,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Since we're on this tangent train.

769
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:16,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

770
00:57:16,981 --> 00:57:17,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Battleship.

771
00:57:17,842 --> 00:57:19,224
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck is that?

772
00:57:19,244 --> 00:57:20,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god!

773
00:57:21,326 --> 00:57:24,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, that movie looks a special kind of terrible.

774
00:57:24,488 --> 00:57:24,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that.

775
00:57:25,049 --> 00:57:29,131
[SPEAKER_06]: You posted the trailer on the Facebook, and I think my comment was, quote, this looks like shit.

776
00:57:30,132 --> 00:57:32,033
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Dan showed it to me, and my reply was, what?

777
00:57:32,754 --> 00:57:33,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm sorry.

778
00:57:34,215 --> 00:57:37,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Last time I played Battleship, I didn't.

779
00:57:37,377 --> 00:57:43,861
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way the trailer looked, like with the configuration of the ships, I was literally expecting Leonison to shout out, I-7-

780
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,402
[SPEAKER_06]: and Rihanna to go, girl, you shunk my battleship.

781
00:57:49,482 --> 00:57:50,482
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they're setting up.

782
00:57:50,642 --> 00:57:53,344
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, well, our radar's out.

783
00:57:53,484 --> 00:57:57,786
[SPEAKER_08]: We have this satellite imagery that we're going to use to plot where we fire stuff.

784
00:57:58,126 --> 00:58:01,968
[SPEAKER_08]: And the enemies, you know, whatever their missiles or whatever, they're the pegs.

785
00:58:02,268 --> 00:58:07,051
[SPEAKER_06]: They spent money, lots and lots of money on that movie.

786
00:58:07,491 --> 00:58:12,374
[SPEAKER_06]: And what really freaks me out is that they bought the rights to all these other board games too.

787
00:58:12,414 --> 00:58:14,015
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to do a new Clue movie.

788
00:58:14,095 --> 00:58:14,515
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like,

789
00:58:15,015 --> 00:58:28,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, no, no, no, no The one in the 80s was perfect It's a cult classic It's Tim Curry at his finest Second finest next to Furter Third finest next to Furter And Pennywise

790
00:58:30,331 --> 00:58:34,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth finest next to Furter, Pennywise, and whatever, and Annie.

791
00:58:34,813 --> 00:58:34,993
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

792
00:58:35,253 --> 00:58:36,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, what about the demon in Labyrinth?

793
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:37,054
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn it.

794
00:58:37,094 --> 00:58:38,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fifth finest.

795
00:58:38,154 --> 00:58:38,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just face it.

796
00:58:38,814 --> 00:58:39,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim Curry is always awesome.

797
00:58:39,935 --> 00:58:40,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Every movie he touches is amazing.

798
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:42,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Even in The Worst Witch, he was awesome.

799
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:47,798
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, don't make Clue like Battleship.

800
00:58:47,998 --> 00:58:48,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I will cry.

801
00:58:49,879 --> 00:58:55,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I just expect this scene of Miss Peacock walking these little squares in the, like, oh my god.

802
00:58:56,622 --> 00:59:00,125
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all of a sudden aliens come from outer space and destroy everything.

803
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:05,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Den doing Laundromat says, you sunk my battleshit.

804
00:59:05,531 --> 00:59:06,652
[SPEAKER_06]: You sunk my battleshit.

805
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:10,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and Ism said, you sunk my box office sales.

806
00:59:10,776 --> 00:59:12,558
[SPEAKER_10]: And Frisbee says, you sunk my PT boat.

807
00:59:14,003 --> 00:59:14,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah.

808
00:59:14,644 --> 00:59:15,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Yahtzee movie.

809
00:59:15,604 --> 00:59:16,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Good idea, Sterlok.

810
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:23,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, TigerClaw on chat says, you know, despite what you see in the trailer, it could be a fun popcorn movie if you ignore the fact it's based on a board game.

811
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:28,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Go watch the trailer again and then come back and tell me that.

812
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:29,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it could be snakes on the plane.

813
00:59:30,593 --> 00:59:33,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe getting high will be fun.

814
00:59:34,456 --> 00:59:36,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the first half of the trailer, don't get me wrong, I was like, okay, this is

815
00:59:37,017 --> 00:59:37,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

816
01:00:04,076 --> 01:00:05,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I just picture this trailer in my mind.

817
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:06,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Monopoly?

818
01:00:06,099 --> 01:00:09,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I just picture Russell Brand sitting in a top hat and a monocle going, I'll get out of jail free called.

819
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Monopoly, Ouija.

820
01:00:24,823 --> 01:00:27,847
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing a new Ouija movie.

821
01:00:29,569 --> 01:00:32,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it going to be like, what was the best Ouija movie ever?

822
01:00:33,233 --> 01:00:34,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe The Exorcist.

823
01:00:36,517 --> 01:00:36,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

824
01:00:37,158 --> 01:00:38,619
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Witch Board?

825
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:40,742
[SPEAKER_10]: That movie was based off of Ouija board.

826
01:00:40,982 --> 01:00:41,663
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Witch Board?

827
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, alright, I don't want to talk about these horrible movies anymore.

828
01:00:46,421 --> 01:00:51,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Although it is related to games, every single one of these movies will have a game tie-in to it, you better believe it.

829
01:00:51,922 --> 01:00:58,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So there will be something on the Wii that you can get for the Battleship movie that'll be, you know, Liam Neeson yelling, I7!

830
01:00:59,545 --> 01:01:02,386
[SPEAKER_10]: I do, by the way, have to quote something from Tumblr.

831
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:09,128
[SPEAKER_10]: If you watch The Exorcist Backwards, it's about a girl who's really sick and then eats some pea soup and gets better.

832
01:01:10,408 --> 01:01:22,909
[SPEAKER_08]: shut up I'll bring it up later but I'm trying to find that list of movies that they have maybe we'll save it for like the afterbirth or something but it's terrible I know

833
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:26,809
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, can we move on?

834
01:01:47,618 --> 01:01:51,219
[SPEAKER_06]: All this other news that just kind of showed up in the press releases.

835
01:01:51,319 --> 01:01:55,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the fact that original NES games were coming to virtual console.

836
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,981
[SPEAKER_06]: That just was kind of, oh yeah, well since we're giving them away, we're just going to throw that out there.

837
01:01:59,001 --> 01:02:00,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to point out something to Laha.

838
01:02:00,622 --> 01:02:00,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

839
01:02:01,102 --> 01:02:02,562
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a Dungeons & Dragons movie.

840
01:02:03,383 --> 01:02:04,383
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty bad.

841
01:02:04,463 --> 01:02:05,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Tom Baker was in it, however.

842
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:09,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the kid from Serial Mom was in it.

843
01:02:09,724 --> 01:02:11,525
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a sequel, by the way.

844
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:37,532
[SPEAKER_10]: and just to let you know, the movie Krull that came out when I was pretty young I saw it in the theater, I'll put it that way was supposed to be the Dungeons & Dragons movie and they lost the license for it so Dungeons & Dragons has been done for the record though, I did kind of like the Dungeons & Dragons movie Dungeons & Dragons, you will believe that a Wayans can be an elf

845
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:39,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Mario 3D Land

846
01:03:01,573 --> 01:03:09,035
[SPEAKER_06]: No further information still on Kid Icarus, which is also supposed to be this holiday, but they haven't exactly said when that is.

847
01:03:09,135 --> 01:03:12,076
[SPEAKER_06]: And now there's a little bit of concern that maybe it's not going to make this year.

848
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:13,477
[SPEAKER_08]: You know the best part about Mario Kart 7?

849
01:03:14,397 --> 01:03:16,818
[SPEAKER_08]: According to Kotaku, it's actually the ninth Mario Kart game.

850
01:03:18,418 --> 01:03:19,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it really?

851
01:03:19,058 --> 01:03:19,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

852
01:03:19,759 --> 01:03:21,039
[SPEAKER_06]: What games did they forget?

853
01:03:21,319 --> 01:03:21,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcade ones.

854
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:26,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo didn't really develop the arcade ones.

855
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't Namco do those?

856
01:03:27,901 --> 01:03:29,581
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still Mario Kart.

857
01:03:29,961 --> 01:03:32,342
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a Pac-Man movie, by the way, but it was animated.

858
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,982
[SPEAKER_06]: They would not be considered canon.

859
01:03:34,542 --> 01:03:38,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I would support calling it Mario Kart 7 because the arcade ones are not canon.

860
01:03:38,723 --> 01:03:39,944
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not as good, either.

861
01:03:40,824 --> 01:03:41,544
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really not.

862
01:03:42,064 --> 01:03:43,985
[SPEAKER_06]: They're okay for arcade games, I guess, but...

863
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:47,006
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not the same quality as the home ones.

864
01:03:47,306 --> 01:03:51,828
[SPEAKER_06]: And unlike Loki, I love me some Mario Kart and I am looking forward to this new one.

865
01:03:51,868 --> 01:03:55,769
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as it's not Double Dash bad, then I am looking forward to the new one.

866
01:03:57,010 --> 01:04:01,272
[SPEAKER_10]: I did actually have to point out that just about everything that Lahaz suggested, there actually have been movies.

867
01:04:02,332 --> 01:04:03,232
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a Pac-Man movie.

868
01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:03,913
[SPEAKER_10]: It was animated.

869
01:04:05,153 --> 01:04:06,814
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a Pac-Man TV show back in the day.

870
01:04:06,834 --> 01:04:07,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there was.

871
01:04:07,454 --> 01:04:08,314
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the same series.

872
01:04:08,354 --> 01:04:09,455
[SPEAKER_10]: The movie was in the same series.

873
01:04:09,475 --> 01:04:11,796
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also Pac-Man Save Santa Claus.

874
01:04:13,427 --> 01:04:15,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I watched it.

875
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:17,510
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what my two shows were when I was a kid?

876
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:18,651
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Pac-Man and Q-Bert.

877
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:20,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched the Q-Bert cartoon too.

878
01:04:21,893 --> 01:04:23,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on.

879
01:04:24,195 --> 01:04:27,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Candyland was also one of the other licenses that they had.

880
01:04:29,418 --> 01:04:31,720
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Monopoly Battleship, Candyland, and Ouija.

881
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, I hope Patrick Stewart stars in Candyland.

882
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:44,811
[SPEAKER_06]: set course for yellow square engage Spock is not impressed

883
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:49,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh... Did they get Chutes and Ladders, too?

884
01:04:49,513 --> 01:04:50,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

885
01:04:51,173 --> 01:04:52,334
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

886
01:04:52,394 --> 01:04:53,354
[SPEAKER_10]: How about HiHoCherryO?

887
01:04:54,235 --> 01:04:54,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

888
01:04:54,495 --> 01:04:55,155
[SPEAKER_06]: How about a story?

889
01:04:55,455 --> 01:04:56,215
[SPEAKER_10]: This is stupid.

890
01:04:56,696 --> 01:04:58,556
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm gonna say why it's stupid after I read it.

891
01:04:58,596 --> 01:05:06,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, the ESA wants $1.1 million reimbursement from the state of California for the law that failed.

892
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, it's for Brown v. EMA.

893
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:08,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

894
01:05:10,061 --> 01:05:33,903
[SPEAKER_10]: and basically the whole point is that and this is a quote California persisted in defending a law that plaintiffs warned of the legislature was unconstitutional before it passed that was previously found to be unconstitutional by the district court and a unanimous panel of the Ninth Circuit and that is similar to at least eight other laws invalidated as unconstitutional prior to the time California sought seriatory in this case

895
01:05:35,024 --> 01:05:40,186
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, you knew, but you pursued it anyway because you're stupid?

896
01:05:40,266 --> 01:05:40,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Pay us.

897
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:43,067
[SPEAKER_10]: We spent a lot of money beating your ass.

898
01:05:43,347 --> 01:05:43,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Pay us.

899
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:51,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, California did send a check for $282,794 for reimbursement for legal fees.

900
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:52,490
[SPEAKER_10]: However, we're broke in California.

901
01:06:02,298 --> 01:06:03,619
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of where I'm at.

902
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:13,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, ESA kind of deserves it, but at the same time, we don't have the money right now, so you just need to... I'm going to tell you what's going to happen, ESA.

903
01:06:13,648 --> 01:06:15,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen to me, representatives of the ESA.

904
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:17,312
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what's going to happen if you get your money.

905
01:06:18,213 --> 01:06:27,161
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to find another tax to raise or increase our tuition again or do something else, and it's going to hurt the people that pretty much fund your operation.

906
01:06:29,516 --> 01:06:31,417
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so hard because I can see it from both sides.

907
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:37,200
[SPEAKER_06]: The ESA spent a lot of money defending something that should have never been a law in the first place.

908
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,940
[SPEAKER_06]: They were defending our rights.

909
01:06:39,641 --> 01:06:42,562
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's kind of like they should be entitled to that money.

910
01:06:42,662 --> 01:06:44,063
[SPEAKER_06]: But I am with you.

911
01:06:44,523 --> 01:06:47,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I know damn well that money is not going to come out of thin air.

912
01:06:47,965 --> 01:06:48,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's so much...

913
01:06:48,985 --> 01:06:50,025
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't need to come out of thin air.

914
01:06:50,045 --> 01:06:54,947
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to come out of fucking Leland Yee's ass is where it needs to fucking come from.

915
01:06:55,207 --> 01:06:56,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's where the money should come from.

916
01:06:56,908 --> 01:06:57,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

917
01:06:57,668 --> 01:06:59,329
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to take it right from the source.

918
01:07:00,289 --> 01:07:01,630
[SPEAKER_10]: I would support that.

919
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:11,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly think that any of these politicians that have basically brought up anything like this that have failed that spent our taxpayer dollars because you know he didn't pay anything out of pocket for any of this shit.

920
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:19,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything that comes out of our pockets as taxpayers, the ones responsible for the failed law need to pay it themselves.

921
01:07:37,004 --> 01:07:37,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what?

922
01:07:37,585 --> 01:07:45,730
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually something, because here in California, basically, we are pretty much a direct democracy here.

923
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,751
[SPEAKER_10]: We can vote on what we want.

924
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:52,394
[SPEAKER_10]: All you have to do is have enough signatures to put it on the ballot, and it can be voted on.

925
01:07:53,294 --> 01:08:16,674
[SPEAKER_10]: and this is something that I would seriously sit back and pen and I've got friends that will review the legal side of it for me for free this is something that I would sit back and pen myself that a politician needs to be responsible for anything they do that fails if they cost the taxpayer money on a failed venture then it needs to come out of their personal pocket or they need to have a cut and pay

926
01:08:16,994 --> 01:08:25,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to get too political, but you wouldn't want to scare off a politician from doing something that maybe they really should be doing.

927
01:08:25,961 --> 01:08:29,243
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a middle ground somewhere.

928
01:08:29,644 --> 01:08:33,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're right, but you have to be very careful in how you word something like that.

929
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:39,113
[SPEAKER_06]: is that the court should be able to find the person liable when gross negligence is shown.

930
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:42,557
[SPEAKER_06]: There needs to be something that the judge could do it.

931
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:51,609
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't want all politicians to have to suffer because of people constantly going after rights and things like that.

932
01:08:52,009 --> 01:08:52,689
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

933
01:09:10,675 --> 01:09:13,356
[SPEAKER_10]: They're still out there.

934
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,377
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, we're broke in California.

935
01:09:17,037 --> 01:09:25,480
[SPEAKER_10]: We have no money, even though we have some of the highest grossing income people in the country that live in our state.

936
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:30,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they being taxed relatively any more than we are?

937
01:09:31,162 --> 01:09:34,287
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because of Republicans.

938
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:44,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, but I'm saying that when you come to the point that we don't have any more money to pay on any of this, and they're still going and pursuing stuff that they know is going to cost us money.

939
01:09:46,924 --> 01:09:47,445
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the point?

940
01:09:49,517 --> 01:09:50,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, when is that going to stop?

941
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:52,138
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to keep doing stupid shit.

942
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Just look at all the dumb laws they have in San Francisco.

943
01:09:56,661 --> 01:09:57,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

944
01:09:57,822 --> 01:09:58,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

945
01:09:58,802 --> 01:10:00,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were going to try to ban circumcision.

946
01:10:00,043 --> 01:10:03,044
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole circumcision thing that went on the ballot and had to be thrown out.

947
01:10:03,064 --> 01:10:09,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was thrown out by a judge that it's not going to be on the ballot because it was just too ridiculous or whatever legal thing they decided.

948
01:10:09,828 --> 01:10:12,590
[SPEAKER_10]: And besides that, it would infringe on religious rights.

949
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:13,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

950
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:14,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

951
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:17,593
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, it's just so... But it's like, who paid for that?

952
01:10:18,153 --> 01:10:19,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Who paid for that whole process?

953
01:10:19,755 --> 01:10:26,420
[SPEAKER_10]: They pay... The reason why I think it's so expensive to live in San Francisco is because they have a bunch of ridiculous laws that aren't necessary.

954
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,782
[SPEAKER_10]: None of us elsewhere have to deal with it.

955
01:10:28,862 --> 01:10:30,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Just in San Francisco, they have this shit.

956
01:10:31,524 --> 01:10:37,328
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, I don't want to get too political here, but some could look and say, hmm, in San Francisco, everyone has health care.

957
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:38,489
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

958
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:39,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's one I agree with.

959
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:41,532
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm saying there's other...

960
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:43,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

961
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:44,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

962
01:10:45,271 --> 01:10:49,093
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta not... I think Jamie needs a spin-off show that's political.

963
01:10:50,373 --> 01:10:52,294
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because then I would be hoarse and have a headache.

964
01:10:52,354 --> 01:10:53,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Called Stitchin' Bitch.

965
01:10:53,294 --> 01:10:53,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

966
01:10:54,095 --> 01:10:54,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

967
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:57,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what do you have for us?

968
01:10:57,997 --> 01:10:58,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to gaming.

969
01:10:59,197 --> 01:11:10,142
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop is now prepared to offer downloadable PC purchases at retail, much like they do right now with digital purchases for DLC and stuff like that.

970
01:11:10,682 --> 01:11:10,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh,

971
01:11:12,483 --> 01:11:15,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, great if you want to do that.

972
01:11:15,424 --> 01:11:19,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you're trading used items for download content or something like that.

973
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:29,908
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, much like I don't see the point in download content being purchased at retail, I don't really see the point of buying a digital PC title at retail.

974
01:11:29,988 --> 01:11:37,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, shit, if you're going to go to retail to buy a digital title, like, say, any game that's out there now that's...

975
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:41,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I think GameCroc's just trying to do what they have to do to stay relevant, but it ain't gonna work.

976
01:11:57,674 --> 01:11:58,675
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

977
01:12:21,061 --> 01:12:24,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess that's cool if you want all those extras.

978
01:12:25,523 --> 01:12:28,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know Steam does a lot of extras like that as well.

979
01:12:29,205 --> 01:12:35,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's just really... If that's important to you, then I'd go that route.

980
01:12:35,148 --> 01:12:43,552
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're just looking to buy digital stuff... I mean, it's kind of like the whole point of buying digital in the first place is so you don't have to go to the store.

981
01:12:44,153 --> 01:12:48,935
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess if you're young enough and you don't have a credit card or something like that, then that may be the only way to go.

982
01:12:49,695 --> 01:12:49,916
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

983
01:12:50,976 --> 01:12:51,438
[SPEAKER_08]: But whatever, you know

984
01:12:54,616 --> 01:12:55,476
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they want to do.

985
01:12:56,196 --> 01:12:58,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Power to the players, as they say.

986
01:12:59,177 --> 01:13:03,439
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be really neat if I could get into the used game market with this stuff.

987
01:13:03,499 --> 01:13:11,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I should be able to Steam revoke my access to a game and I get a credit to use on the store and then somebody else can buy the game at a reduced price or something.

988
01:13:12,381 --> 01:13:20,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that will never happen, but if you think about it, they could do something where the publisher would get a cut of that, and that doesn't happen right now in the retail stores.

989
01:13:21,548 --> 01:13:26,970
[SPEAKER_06]: There could be a way, if publishers were smarter about the used game market, where they could get a cut of it.

990
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:31,051
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not just talking these $10 online passes.

991
01:13:31,831 --> 01:13:33,692
[SPEAKER_06]: But, whatever.

992
01:13:35,152 --> 01:13:36,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, moving on.

993
01:13:36,713 --> 01:13:40,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of prices, Xbox Live Arcade.

994
01:13:40,094 --> 01:13:42,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you noticed something about the games on Xbox Live Arcade?

995
01:13:42,915 --> 01:13:46,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the points have been slowly rising.

996
01:13:46,256 --> 01:13:49,457
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, the cost of the games have been rising on Xbox Live Arcade.

997
01:13:50,038 --> 01:14:06,695
[SPEAKER_06]: so far in 2011 there have been 20 1200 plus games last year 27 of the 85 games released for the service cost 1200 points or more so we're already at 20 for this year so that was an 8% increase in itself over 2009 when 21 titles hit that price point

998
01:14:09,377 --> 01:14:16,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, they are saying that, you know, well, we have to blame the fact that the quality of games we're basically making is a lot higher too.

999
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:20,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Limbo and Castle Crashers, they're as good as anything else that's out on the market.

1000
01:14:21,203 --> 01:14:22,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what do you guys think?

1001
01:14:22,904 --> 01:14:27,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that Xbox Live Arcade games are getting better and therefore they're worth the extra money?

1002
01:14:28,347 --> 01:14:31,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think this is just inflation when we're not paying attention?

1003
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:34,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's inflation.

1004
01:14:36,646 --> 01:15:05,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a little bit of a mix of both I think yes it's inflation going on but at the same time you really don't see any more like just crappy lazy arcade ports ever since Xbox or Microsoft kind of banned those from the service like you don't see any more of this just re-release of an old ass game that's you know 400 Microsoft points most of the stuff that's coming out now definitely had a lot of development dollars put into it with mixed success some of it's really good some of it's not so good it just depends on what kind of games you're into

1005
01:15:06,621 --> 01:15:07,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a little bit of both.

1006
01:15:07,941 --> 01:15:08,562
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

1007
01:15:08,582 --> 01:15:09,442
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

1008
01:15:09,542 --> 01:15:10,722
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to put out $20 games.

1009
01:15:13,143 --> 01:15:14,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you don't have to buy them.

1010
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,724
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's forcing you to buy them.

1011
01:15:16,904 --> 01:15:17,384
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

1012
01:15:17,424 --> 01:15:18,625
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're smart, you wait.

1013
01:15:19,065 --> 01:15:23,526
[SPEAKER_08]: And then sometimes when that game pops up onto the deal of the week, then you buy it for a cheaper price.

1014
01:15:23,846 --> 01:15:24,527
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still do.

1015
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:27,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say one thing I do love is that you still get the demos.

1016
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:31,149
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something you can't always get at a retail store.

1017
01:15:31,689 --> 01:15:33,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is one thing I really like.

1018
01:15:33,869 --> 01:15:35,730
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can really, really try a game before I buy it.

1019
01:15:37,546 --> 01:15:42,270
[SPEAKER_06]: So Xbox Live Arcade, even though the prices are creeping up, as long as the quality stays good.

1020
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:44,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's been a lot of good arcade games I've played lately.

1021
01:15:44,932 --> 01:15:45,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's okay.

1022
01:15:46,314 --> 01:15:46,914
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

1023
01:15:47,274 --> 01:15:47,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Sakura.

1024
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in other news, this actually is for our UK listeners.

1025
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:55,812
[SPEAKER_10]: The shop game restarted its Play Now, Trade Later deal.

1026
01:15:56,452 --> 01:16:01,674
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, you can buy a game and trade it in at a guaranteed amount.

1027
01:16:02,074 --> 01:16:06,216
[SPEAKER_10]: So you essentially end up paying five pounds for your game.

1028
01:16:07,036 --> 01:16:09,457
[SPEAKER_10]: And the games that are included on this list is...

1029
01:16:11,598 --> 01:16:19,921
[SPEAKER_10]: UFC Trainer for Wii, Cars 2 on DS, Art Academy, Call of Juarez the Cartel, Hunted, The Demon's Forge, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2 for Wii.

1030
01:16:20,601 --> 01:16:24,463
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a number of games you'd have to check with your local game store to find out.

1031
01:16:24,903 --> 01:16:31,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, if you trade in any of those games for credit before August 12th, they'll effectively cost £5.

1032
01:16:33,026 --> 01:16:35,548
[SPEAKER_10]: You can use the credit on any future purchase.

1033
01:16:35,968 --> 01:16:38,890
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty good.

1034
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:43,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a good way to save money, especially if these are games that you got and you're kind of like, eh, meh.

1035
01:16:43,774 --> 01:16:48,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like a really weird way of doing like a demo or like a rental service.

1036
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:55,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in February, they also had one where it guaranteed a 35-pound trade-in for shooters like Killzone 3 and Bulletstorm.

1037
01:16:56,462 --> 01:16:59,665
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a good way to basically refill stock.

1038
01:17:00,565 --> 01:17:00,725
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

1039
01:17:01,586 --> 01:17:01,706
Hmm.

1040
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:04,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see how successful this is.

1041
01:17:04,331 --> 01:17:04,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1042
01:17:04,752 --> 01:17:06,974
[SPEAKER_06]: None of those games are making me go, ooh, gotta get it.

1043
01:17:07,474 --> 01:17:10,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, I live in the wrong country anyway, but we'll see.

1044
01:17:11,378 --> 01:17:12,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good luck.

1045
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:21,367
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, let's travel the world and talk about release dates and what upcoming games you could maybe get a five-pound deal or five-dollar deal on later.

1046
01:17:23,816 --> 01:17:25,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not a whole lot this week.

1047
01:17:25,757 --> 01:17:29,759
[SPEAKER_08]: At least there's some games coming out this week.

1048
01:17:29,779 --> 01:17:32,640
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a few weeks coming up here where there's nothing.

1049
01:17:33,721 --> 01:17:36,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting off, Phineas and Ferb Across the Second Dimension.

1050
01:17:36,822 --> 01:17:37,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Phineas and Ferb.

1051
01:17:38,643 --> 01:17:41,044
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out on PlayStation 3 with Move support.

1052
01:17:41,064 --> 01:17:42,544
[SPEAKER_08]: How much is it?

1053
01:17:43,845 --> 01:17:44,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe $40.

1054
01:17:45,466 --> 01:17:47,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you love Phineas and Ferb $40 much?

1055
01:17:49,363 --> 01:17:50,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just keep watching episodes off the internet.

1056
01:18:12,106 --> 01:18:15,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Sesame Street, Ready, Set, Grover coming out on the DS and the Wii.

1057
01:18:16,009 --> 01:18:19,171
[SPEAKER_08]: DS version has a funny little Grover stylus.

1058
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:21,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it might be that Kinect game that they were showing at E3.

1059
01:18:21,973 --> 01:18:23,654
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, that got delayed.

1060
01:18:25,195 --> 01:18:30,119
[SPEAKER_08]: On the Wii version you get a Grover fuzzy Wii remote cover.

1061
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, you said that really quick.

1062
01:18:33,301 --> 01:18:34,081
[SPEAKER_06]: That got delayed?

1063
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:34,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Delayed to when?

1064
01:18:34,962 --> 01:18:35,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Next year?

1065
01:18:37,023 --> 01:18:37,904
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just in the fall.

1066
01:18:38,804 --> 01:18:39,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Like October.

1067
01:18:40,951 --> 01:18:43,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess I thought that was when it was always set to come out.

1068
01:18:44,093 --> 01:18:48,335
[SPEAKER_08]: It was August at one point.

1069
01:18:49,436 --> 01:18:51,077
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, let's see here.

1070
01:18:55,441 --> 01:18:56,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1071
01:19:13,026 --> 01:19:15,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Bleach Soul Resurrection for the PlayStation 3.

1072
01:19:15,427 --> 01:19:19,890
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be kind of like a Dice Warriors type of game.

1073
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:25,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, you get three free episodes or the anime episodes on PlayStation Network.

1074
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,074
[SPEAKER_08]: You get a voucher for that.

1075
01:19:27,094 --> 01:19:27,574
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of cool.

1076
01:19:29,175 --> 01:19:31,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Sniper Ghost Warrior Extended Edition.

1077
01:19:31,816 --> 01:19:32,337
[SPEAKER_08]: That's coming out on 360.

1078
01:19:32,457 --> 01:19:33,017
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.

1079
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:44,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the enthusiasm in the chat room shown by Sterlok at chat.orangelunchradio.com Sterlok says, Yay Grover!

1080
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,389
[SPEAKER_06]: He was my favorite when I was a kid.

1081
01:19:46,489 --> 01:19:47,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Him and Cookie Monster.

1082
01:19:49,913 --> 01:19:55,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in my day, Elmo didn't exist on the old school Sesame Street back when I was a kid.

1083
01:19:56,521 --> 01:19:58,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Which we like to refer to as the good old days.

1084
01:19:58,884 --> 01:19:59,344
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1085
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:02,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Breakman says, I preferred the Muppets.

1086
01:20:02,408 --> 01:20:05,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked Muppet Babies, but it was always about Fraggle Rock.

1087
01:20:05,211 --> 01:20:07,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about you guys, but anyhow.

1088
01:20:07,073 --> 01:20:08,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Fraggle Rock is awesome.

1089
01:20:08,723 --> 01:20:10,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, going to Japanese release dates.

1090
01:20:10,885 --> 01:20:18,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a slow week over there as well, but on the Xbox 360 this week, you get a couple of price reductions, including Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Special Edition and Tropico 3.

1091
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:20,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Both move into the Platinum Collection.

1092
01:20:20,432 --> 01:20:22,713
[SPEAKER_06]: That's on the 4th of August on the Xbox 360.

1093
01:20:23,254 --> 01:20:30,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Going over to the PlayStation 3, we have Assassin's Creed Brotherhood there as well, and then another game getting a price reduction.

1094
01:20:30,679 --> 01:20:31,920
[SPEAKER_06]: This has a whopper of a name.

1095
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:32,160
[SPEAKER_06]: It's

1096
01:20:33,201 --> 01:20:41,345
[SPEAKER_06]: R Tonelico 3 Sekai Shuin no Hikigane wa Shujou no Uta ga Hajuku gets a price reduction this week.

1097
01:20:41,445 --> 01:20:42,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea what game this is.

1098
01:20:42,845 --> 01:20:43,746
[SPEAKER_06]: It's R Tonelico.

1099
01:20:45,026 --> 01:20:54,070
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a role-playing game and of course it looks like you can dress the little girls up as bunnies in the game and I can see a little item shop in some of these pictures.

1100
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:56,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, the game looks kind of cool but I don't think we have this here.

1101
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:58,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we do.

1102
01:20:58,092 --> 01:20:59,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Not number three, I don't think.

1103
01:20:59,253 --> 01:20:59,993
[SPEAKER_08]: We have number two at least.

1104
01:21:00,013 --> 01:21:00,553
[SPEAKER_06]: What game is this?

1105
01:21:00,633 --> 01:21:01,934
[SPEAKER_08]: It's R Tonelico.

1106
01:21:02,814 --> 01:21:04,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I didn't know that was out here.

1107
01:21:04,774 --> 01:21:05,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's out here.

1108
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:06,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go.

1109
01:21:06,435 --> 01:21:07,155
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks interesting.

1110
01:21:07,215 --> 01:21:07,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll check it out.

1111
01:21:08,235 --> 01:21:09,455
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's see.

1112
01:21:09,475 --> 01:21:10,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to other consoles.

1113
01:21:10,655 --> 01:21:15,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if Nintendo has anything on their lineup, but I will check.

1114
01:21:16,837 --> 01:21:17,997
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can do the PSP.

1115
01:21:18,097 --> 01:21:19,277
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a couple games there.

1116
01:21:19,317 --> 01:21:24,878
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Storm Lover, Summer Love from D3, Toriyoko, Gourmet Survival.

1117
01:21:26,058 --> 01:21:27,659
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that, like Iron Chef or Dai?

1118
01:21:28,599 --> 01:21:29,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Gourmet Survival!

1119
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:30,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Gourmet Survival!

1120
01:21:30,579 --> 01:21:31,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Man vs. Beast

1121
01:21:49,631 --> 01:21:50,352
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what that is.

1122
01:21:51,513 --> 01:21:57,361
[SPEAKER_06]: That's on the BSP this week as well as Yusha 32nd from Marvelous comes out this week as well.

1123
01:21:57,381 --> 01:22:00,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if that's a version of 32nd Hero or Half Minute Hero.

1124
01:22:00,324 --> 01:22:00,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes, it is.

1125
01:22:00,845 --> 01:22:03,628
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Half Minute Hero Part 2 comes out this week in Japan.

1126
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:04,369
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be a lot of fun.

1127
01:22:05,931 --> 01:22:07,212
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's on the PSP this week.

1128
01:22:07,613 --> 01:22:13,799
[SPEAKER_06]: And going to the Nintendo Wii, Epic Mickey gets a release in Japan this week, finally.

1129
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,381
[SPEAKER_06]: So they must have localized it for Japan.

1130
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:19,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Disney's pretty big over there, so they probably took a little while for them to localize it all.

1131
01:22:19,085 --> 01:22:20,306
[SPEAKER_10]: They had to add Duffy to it.

1132
01:22:21,468 --> 01:22:21,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1133
01:22:22,048 --> 01:22:23,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Duffy is bigger than Mickey in Japan.

1134
01:22:24,191 --> 01:22:24,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it really?

1135
01:22:25,071 --> 01:22:26,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, Duffy is pretty big.

1136
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:36,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Family Fishing as well on the Wii and lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Nazo Waku Yakata Oton no Aida ni Ade ni comes out.

1137
01:22:36,712 --> 01:22:38,936
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks like, is this a Professor Layton game?

1138
01:22:40,925 --> 01:22:41,646
[SPEAKER_08]: It would appear so.

1139
01:22:42,366 --> 01:22:46,389
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's Professor Layton's Haunted Mansion or something like that on the 3DS.

1140
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:47,810
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1141
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:49,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Your Japanese release dates.

1142
01:22:49,951 --> 01:22:51,713
[SPEAKER_06]: As I horribly butcher the names as I always do.

1143
01:22:51,973 --> 01:22:53,174
[SPEAKER_10]: In Europe, two things.

1144
01:22:54,074 --> 01:22:58,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Limbo for PC and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet on Xbox 360.

1145
01:22:59,018 --> 01:23:00,038
[SPEAKER_08]: That is an awesome game.

1146
01:23:00,138 --> 01:23:00,459
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1147
01:23:01,019 --> 01:23:01,540
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks monochrome.

1148
01:23:25,962 --> 01:23:29,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's got a unique art style to it.

1149
01:23:30,615 --> 01:23:31,859
[SPEAKER_08]: It's insanely twisted.

1150
01:23:35,156 --> 01:23:40,259
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk a little bit more about earnings and lack thereof.

1151
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:50,467
[SPEAKER_08]: THQ is disappointed in their earnings for Fiscal Quarter 2, including Red Faction and the performance of that.

1152
01:23:51,127 --> 01:23:54,810
[SPEAKER_08]: They're thinking, of course, Quarter 3 could be its best.

1153
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:58,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry, it was Quarter 1 instead they were pissed off about.

1154
01:23:59,894 --> 01:24:01,335
[SPEAKER_08]: These Fiscal Quarters get confusing.

1155
01:24:03,016 --> 01:24:09,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, they were saying sales of Red Faction Armageddon and our licensed kid titles were below expectations.

1156
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:14,063
[SPEAKER_08]: The late release of UFC Personal Trainer also adversely impacted the quarter.

1157
01:24:15,284 --> 01:24:15,504
[SPEAKER_08]: You know...

1158
01:24:17,265 --> 01:24:23,949
[SPEAKER_08]: THQ, I mean, you had a Kung Fu Panda game come out and you decided to make it U-Draw only.

1159
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:27,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a good choice, I gotta say.

1160
01:24:30,152 --> 01:24:36,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, they're saying that the net loss of $38.4 million and most of the losses are from deferred revenue.

1161
01:24:37,336 --> 01:24:44,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, revenue that the company's not counting yet because it's going towards their online services for its games.

1162
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:55,823
[SPEAKER_08]: and of course Q3 for them is going to be Saints Row the 3rd, WWE 12 and the UDraw tablet for the 360 and PS3 among other things.

1163
01:24:57,483 --> 01:25:02,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Faction did so poorly that it will not be continuing on in any meaningful way.

1164
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:03,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Ouch.

1165
01:25:03,605 --> 01:25:05,826
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is done, fortunately.

1166
01:25:06,646 --> 01:25:09,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Breakman is crying in our chat room over the death of Red Faction.

1167
01:25:09,987 --> 01:25:10,907
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel about it, Loki?

1168
01:25:10,927 --> 01:25:11,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Weren't you a fan of that series?

1169
01:25:12,047 --> 01:25:12,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1170
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:13,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1171
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:15,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't play it.

1172
01:25:15,429 --> 01:25:16,810
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that I don't like it or anything.

1173
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:17,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it looked cool.

1174
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:19,271
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Volition.

1175
01:25:19,351 --> 01:25:19,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Volition.

1176
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:22,293
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's part your fault that the series died, basically.

1177
01:25:22,313 --> 01:25:23,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's because I didn't buy it.

1178
01:25:23,433 --> 01:25:23,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1179
01:25:24,234 --> 01:25:29,277
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you are mad about the death of Red Faction, just send those cards and letters to Loki.

1180
01:25:32,563 --> 01:25:36,069
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it just didn't do that well.

1181
01:25:36,349 --> 01:25:41,738
[SPEAKER_08]: And you would have thought, you know, a game with a unicorn that shoots rainbows out of its ass, that it would have been awesome.

1182
01:25:42,099 --> 01:25:47,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, I hope to God that they bring that weapon over to Saints Row III, because that would be amazing.

1183
01:25:48,657 --> 01:26:05,338
[SPEAKER_08]: and then of course one of the things that they were experimenting with starting with MX vs. ATV is releasing a game for a lower price point and then hoping to make that money up back with download content so they did try that with MX vs. ATV Alive

1184
01:26:05,678 --> 01:26:20,889
[SPEAKER_08]: They put it out at $39.99 and their idea was of course to come out with a robust product at $39.99 price point, build a large install base more quickly, and then monetize that install base to wrap it in a large number of DLC drops.

1185
01:26:22,091 --> 01:26:24,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, it didn't work.

1186
01:26:24,572 --> 01:26:32,256
[SPEAKER_08]: The only problem is the game didn't move enough units to turn, or in turn, move enough download content to make the experiment a success.

1187
01:26:32,936 --> 01:26:39,939
[SPEAKER_08]: So the key to learning was that it was not a successful experiment.

1188
01:26:39,959 --> 01:26:47,002
[SPEAKER_08]: The $39.99 price point, while good, gave us good acceleration of sales, but that wasn't enough to drive the install base where we wanted it to be, obviously.

1189
01:26:49,143 --> 01:26:53,267
[SPEAKER_08]: It just wasn't working out.

1190
01:26:54,367 --> 01:26:56,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Breakman in chat is calling you Darth Loki.

1191
01:26:59,151 --> 01:27:01,413
[SPEAKER_06]: He's very upset about this whole Red Faction thing, just so you know.

1192
01:27:01,772 --> 01:27:03,233
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who you need to blame?

1193
01:27:04,373 --> 01:27:07,055
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who put their logo onto that game?

1194
01:27:08,295 --> 01:27:09,356
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be SyFy.

1195
01:27:10,477 --> 01:27:13,018
[SPEAKER_08]: SyFy Channel had a fucking movie.

1196
01:27:13,438 --> 01:27:15,039
[SPEAKER_08]: It was SyFy Games.

1197
01:27:15,879 --> 01:27:19,962
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to talk about someone putting out a poor product, that would be SyFy.

1198
01:27:22,843 --> 01:27:24,504
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's who you need to blame.

1199
01:27:27,504 --> 01:27:29,385
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, that kind of sucks.

1200
01:27:29,425 --> 01:27:30,305
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least, you know what?

1201
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:35,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I can guarantee that quarter three is going to be amazing because fucking Saints Row the Third, that shit is going to sell like crazy.

1202
01:27:36,107 --> 01:27:36,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1203
01:27:37,308 --> 01:27:44,550
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, I got to... There's part of me didn't want to talk about this next story, but this next story just really makes me angry.

1204
01:27:44,951 --> 01:27:50,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, there's so much to hate in this next story, and I apologize for bringing it up, but you know what?

1205
01:27:50,593 --> 01:27:53,854
[SPEAKER_06]: This should piss you off too because you have the power to change things.

1206
01:27:54,794 --> 01:28:16,750
[SPEAKER_06]: and as you guys know if you ever watch a television you know that there was a horrible horrible tragedy in Norway this past week and you know you had this just crazy asshole that and I'm not even gonna say his name I'm not gonna show you his picture because he doesn't deserve to have it shown he's a crazy asshole and he blew up a building and he shot a bunch of kids at a camp

1207
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:18,311
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1208
01:28:42,465 --> 01:28:46,486
[SPEAKER_06]: and what happens when a horrific situation happens?

1209
01:28:46,886 --> 01:28:47,866
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to blame something.

1210
01:28:47,946 --> 01:28:49,647
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to blame someone, you want to blame something.

1211
01:28:49,707 --> 01:28:51,487
[SPEAKER_06]: So why am I bringing it up here on Orange Lounge Radio?

1212
01:28:51,747 --> 01:28:52,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what got blamed?

1213
01:28:52,968 --> 01:28:53,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Video games.

1214
01:28:53,548 --> 01:28:54,048
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1215
01:28:54,328 --> 01:29:00,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Norwegian retailers have pulled World of Warcraft and Call of Duty after the shooting.

1216
01:29:00,109 --> 01:29:06,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the big retailers because I guess this asshole wrote some manifesto that either talked about the games.

1217
01:29:06,511 --> 01:29:10,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he had actually said he learned how to shoot or whatever in Call of Duty.

1218
01:29:11,132 --> 01:29:33,706
[SPEAKER_06]: which I don't know why you would take what a crazy asshole says at face value but whatever I mean this just infuriates me because it's like don't pay attention to this stupid asshole by banning these games I feel like you're validating what he says and that's the last thing you should do in a situation like this it's so irritating

1219
01:29:35,107 --> 01:29:41,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Warcraft provided a useful cover story for the time he spent in seclusion plotting his terrorist attacks.

1220
01:29:48,666 --> 01:29:52,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And then playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was a way to keep his skills honed.

1221
01:29:53,010 --> 01:30:00,538
[SPEAKER_06]: So the retailers Co-op Norway and Plate Companyet, I can't say these Norwegian names, but something like that, they pulled the games.

1222
01:30:00,798 --> 01:30:06,424
[SPEAKER_06]: They are saying it's a temporary removal, but as far as I'm concerned, you know what?

1223
01:30:06,924 --> 01:30:08,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't validate this guy.

1224
01:30:09,807 --> 01:30:10,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Irritating.

1225
01:30:10,928 --> 01:30:12,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we will say this.

1226
01:30:12,309 --> 01:30:14,091
[SPEAKER_06]: SpaceWorld is another retailer.

1227
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:19,836
[SPEAKER_06]: They refused to pull the games, saying it saw no connection between the games and the tragedy.

1228
01:30:19,936 --> 01:30:24,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote, we have never seen any research that games alone have led to such incidents.

1229
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:30,324
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you live in Norway, that would be A plus SpaceWorld, F minus these other guys.

1230
01:30:30,865 --> 01:30:32,366
[SPEAKER_06]: So, shame on that.

1231
01:30:33,667 --> 01:30:35,548
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, of course, it doesn't end there.

1232
01:30:38,331 --> 01:30:38,831
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1233
01:30:59,005 --> 01:31:04,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's the word I would choose to use, but I guess that's what this article is saying here.

1234
01:31:05,046 --> 01:31:17,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Clinical psychologist Christopher Ferguson, a leading expert on video game violence and mass killings at Texas A&M International University, said video games aren't to blame for the tragedy, nor is Doom, nor is Quake, and so on.

1235
01:31:17,128 --> 01:31:26,450
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, he believes that placing the blame on video games whenever a white male is guilty of a killing spree is racist.

1236
01:31:29,799 --> 01:31:34,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird, but I can't say he's totally... I don't know.

1237
01:31:35,963 --> 01:31:39,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind, keep in mind, and this is something that needs to be defined for the entirety of America.

1238
01:31:40,466 --> 01:31:45,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Racism does not mean white against black, white against this.

1239
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:49,552
[SPEAKER_10]: It means one race against another.

1240
01:31:50,192 --> 01:31:53,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it's making a judgment... Based on racial factors only.

1241
01:31:54,415 --> 01:31:54,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1242
01:31:55,456 --> 01:31:57,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And this time he's saying because...

1243
01:31:57,818 --> 01:32:02,676
[SPEAKER_06]: White males commit heinous acts Instantly blaming video games is racist

1244
01:32:05,074 --> 01:32:05,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say bigoted.

1245
01:32:06,995 --> 01:32:07,595
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a better word.

1246
01:32:07,615 --> 01:32:10,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Racist just isn't the right word for me.

1247
01:32:10,136 --> 01:32:11,436
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is sort of profiling.

1248
01:32:12,657 --> 01:32:13,337
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good word.

1249
01:32:13,717 --> 01:32:14,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Profiling.

1250
01:32:15,357 --> 01:32:16,158
[SPEAKER_10]: But racist?

1251
01:32:17,118 --> 01:32:23,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that had to be used for lack of a better, or maybe just for shock value.

1252
01:32:24,541 --> 01:32:27,902
[SPEAKER_10]: But it really is profiling and a bit of bigotry.

1253
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:29,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1254
01:32:30,102 --> 01:32:30,703
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it is.

1255
01:32:32,023 --> 01:32:36,730
[SPEAKER_06]: and the doctor goes on to say mass killings are going to happen and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

1256
01:32:38,081 --> 01:33:01,960
[SPEAKER_06]: fortunately they're not going to happen very often but they're like lightning strikes let's see quote I know it's a little controversial to say but there's a certain type of racism in place of these killings when shootings happen in an inner city in minority populated schools video games are never brought up when these things happen in white majority schools and in the suburbs people start to freak out and video games are inevitably blamed I think that there's a certain element of racism or ignorance here

1257
01:33:03,086 --> 01:33:17,394
[SPEAKER_06]: people really want to know what kind of boogeyman we can hang this on and video games are still the top choice when it comes to any type of tragedy if you want to read more on this you can go to blog.forbes.com and read the full article there let me read another quote from this

1258
01:33:18,254 --> 01:33:34,105
[SPEAKER_06]: really interesting for lack of a better word there are groups out there who are going to blame video games on everything they're like ambulance chasers really I think it's irresponsible and thoughtless to try to make political gain off of someone else's tragedy but they're going to do it

1259
01:33:34,625 --> 01:34:02,123
[SPEAKER_06]: that's what they do but even those groups have been much quieter with the Oslo tragedy and you know we had another follow up story in our show role that I neglected to copy the link for but in a nutshell some crazy religious group is trying to get the games banned here in the US because of the Norway shooting and that quote I agree with these guys are like ambulance chasers to push their own agenda and they are exploiting a disgusting scenario to promote their own agenda and that is sick

1260
01:34:03,661 --> 01:34:05,062
[SPEAKER_06]: In that part, I agree with.

1261
01:34:05,642 --> 01:34:08,864
[SPEAKER_06]: So, really fascinating study.

1262
01:34:09,064 --> 01:34:09,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1263
01:34:09,424 --> 01:34:10,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Draw your own opinions.

1264
01:34:10,525 --> 01:34:11,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Choose your own words.

1265
01:34:11,785 --> 01:34:12,886
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know.

1266
01:34:13,466 --> 01:34:15,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what the whole thing is?

1267
01:34:15,947 --> 01:34:19,669
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is my little commentary on the whole situation.

1268
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:24,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop looking for something to blame other than the people themselves.

1269
01:34:24,352 --> 01:34:25,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1270
01:34:25,732 --> 01:34:30,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Kaishudo in the chatroom says, Rob, don't jump on the side of one nutcase that goes against another nutcase's view.

1271
01:34:31,335 --> 01:34:33,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not totally with this guy.

1272
01:34:33,456 --> 01:34:37,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I get what he's saying, but I don't know if racism would be the word I'd use.

1273
01:34:37,977 --> 01:34:40,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Profiling, like Jamie said, I think is maybe a better word to use.

1274
01:34:40,998 --> 01:34:51,082
[SPEAKER_06]: But when he does talk about the ambulance chaser and how people will use these situations to promote their own agendas, I will say, yes, I agree with him on that.

1275
01:34:51,942 --> 01:34:56,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Weren't we just talking about politicians and the whole Supreme Court thing earlier?

1276
01:34:56,965 --> 01:35:03,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, wasn't that all kind of promoting Leland Yee's own political agenda and continuing to promote his own?

1277
01:35:04,555 --> 01:35:07,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that part, I am with him.

1278
01:35:08,141 --> 01:35:11,706
[SPEAKER_08]: And a certain Lord Voldemort wouldn't have done this in the past at all.

1279
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:18,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and that's really, again, I think a failing of society in general.

1280
01:35:19,641 --> 01:35:27,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I think that if you look at things maybe a hundred years ago or look into another culture.

1281
01:35:28,582 --> 01:35:33,705
[SPEAKER_10]: People were more likely to own up to what was their mistake.

1282
01:35:34,226 --> 01:35:52,278
[SPEAKER_10]: It was considered the mature thing, the honorable thing to do, to own up to your own mistake, to put the blame where it was, to not make those who were circumstantially a part of it pay for it, but those who were specifically responsible for it.

1283
01:35:53,298 --> 01:35:54,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1284
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:17,232
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care what they did.

1285
01:36:17,712 --> 01:36:27,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care if they played My Little Pony while wearing mantis and doing ballet in a little pink frilly tutu.

1286
01:36:27,139 --> 01:36:27,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

1287
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:29,101
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not care.

1288
01:36:29,581 --> 01:36:32,043
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care that J. Edgar Hoover was a transvestite.

1289
01:36:32,123 --> 01:36:32,863
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a bastard.

1290
01:36:33,384 --> 01:36:35,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Him being a transvestite had nothing to do with being a bastard.

1291
01:36:35,785 --> 01:36:40,589
[SPEAKER_08]: All those things, by the way, that she mentioned before are able to be done in Dead Rising 2 off the record.

1292
01:36:40,729 --> 01:36:41,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1293
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:43,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that is true.

1294
01:36:43,555 --> 01:36:49,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Capcom has your weird, sick, twisted fantasies.

1295
01:36:49,341 --> 01:36:53,726
[SPEAKER_06]: The word Capcom is still... I have a bad Pavlov's response to that word this week.

1296
01:36:54,007 --> 01:37:02,696
[SPEAKER_10]: But my point being is that whatever they did in their private life, whatever they do on the side, has nothing to do...

1297
01:37:04,237 --> 01:37:06,218
[SPEAKER_10]: with their final action.

1298
01:37:06,838 --> 01:37:12,740
[SPEAKER_10]: It may have been, okay, well, I've done all this and it's led up to this point, but really, it's what goes on in the head.

1299
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:18,482
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're not right in the head, they're not going to do something right to begin with.

1300
01:37:19,202 --> 01:37:28,546
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're crazy, okay, yeah, maybe they'll get some pleasure out of playing a video game for a little while, but they're going to need something else a little bit later.

1301
01:37:28,706 --> 01:37:29,166
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just...

1302
01:37:30,306 --> 01:37:33,850
[SPEAKER_10]: A bump on, you know, a ripple in the ocean, if that makes sense.

1303
01:37:34,751 --> 01:37:39,436
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little pebble in the pond on the way to the big boulder falling in and damming the whole thing.

1304
01:37:40,437 --> 01:37:41,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

1305
01:37:42,039 --> 01:37:46,924
[SPEAKER_06]: It does, but I'm just, this whole thing is just, it just irritates me.

1306
01:37:48,352 --> 01:37:49,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just sick of the blame game.

1307
01:37:50,794 --> 01:37:52,594
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a big problem with society.

1308
01:37:53,595 --> 01:38:02,759
[SPEAKER_10]: People need to freaking grow up and also have the maturity to put the blame on who it needs to be put on, which is the person who did it.

1309
01:38:02,879 --> 01:38:05,620
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter what else they're into.

1310
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:10,602
[SPEAKER_10]: They could be into latex fetish porn.

1311
01:38:10,642 --> 01:38:13,383
[SPEAKER_06]: He could have been a concert-trained piano player.

1312
01:38:14,404 --> 01:38:16,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the guy in Japan who was the cannibal?

1313
01:38:18,078 --> 01:38:18,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1314
01:38:18,619 --> 01:38:20,040
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm using him as an example.

1315
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:24,285
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a cultured, respected person.

1316
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:31,152
[SPEAKER_10]: He was smart, lived a very good life, but he ate some chick that he went out on dinner with.

1317
01:38:31,332 --> 01:38:33,214
[SPEAKER_08]: He just gave in to the temptation of flesh.

1318
01:38:33,755 --> 01:38:36,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, by the way, now he's actually a paid lecturer, just letting you know.

1319
01:38:37,639 --> 01:38:39,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hear he's eating up all the attention.

1320
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:43,284
[SPEAKER_10]: But my point is... Fired!

1321
01:38:43,725 --> 01:38:44,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1322
01:38:44,765 --> 01:38:46,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, here's another example.

1323
01:38:47,068 --> 01:38:48,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not just saying this because I'm Jewish.

1324
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:49,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Hitler.

1325
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:50,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1326
01:38:51,372 --> 01:38:52,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Failed painter.

1327
01:38:53,894 --> 01:38:57,858
[SPEAKER_10]: He failed his entrance into a prestigious art school.

1328
01:38:58,678 --> 01:38:59,579
[SPEAKER_10]: So he joined the military.

1329
01:39:01,161 --> 01:39:02,061
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a vegetarian!

1330
01:39:03,174 --> 01:39:08,238
[SPEAKER_10]: You would not assume vegetarian and painter would lead to mass murderer.

1331
01:39:09,418 --> 01:39:09,959
[SPEAKER_10]: But it did.

1332
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:15,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to blame all vegetarians and painters now for being potential mass murdering fuckheads?

1333
01:39:16,043 --> 01:39:17,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, vegetarians maybe.

1334
01:39:17,324 --> 01:39:18,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1335
01:39:18,465 --> 01:39:20,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, vegetarians and pita maybe.

1336
01:39:20,727 --> 01:39:22,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, pita is just psycho anyway.

1337
01:39:22,948 --> 01:39:25,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, Jamie, you really murdered that onion in your salad.

1338
01:39:26,671 --> 01:39:28,192
[SPEAKER_10]: But my point is, you know...

1339
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:33,744
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter what their hobbies are.

1340
01:39:33,844 --> 01:39:35,984
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter the walk of life they come from.

1341
01:39:36,444 --> 01:39:37,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy is fucking crazy.

1342
01:39:37,885 --> 01:39:38,965
[SPEAKER_10]: And you blame the person.

1343
01:39:39,385 --> 01:39:43,766
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't see anybody blaming vegetarians for, you know, 100,000 people being killed.

1344
01:39:43,807 --> 01:39:44,747
[SPEAKER_10]: You see them blaming Hitler.

1345
01:39:46,187 --> 01:39:52,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zaku in our chatroom says, Jamie, you have to accept that playing the blame game ever since the Salem witch trials.

1346
01:39:53,067 --> 01:39:54,088
[SPEAKER_10]: And you see what happened then.

1347
01:39:54,509 --> 01:39:55,930
[SPEAKER_10]: A bunch of innocent people died.

1348
01:39:56,311 --> 01:39:57,452
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd think we'd learn from history.

1349
01:39:58,033 --> 01:39:59,514
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because people are stupid.

1350
01:39:59,554 --> 01:40:00,916
[SPEAKER_08]: There may have been some witches in there.

1351
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:01,797
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know.

1352
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:05,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, enough.

1353
01:40:06,182 --> 01:40:06,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough.

1354
01:40:07,063 --> 01:40:09,345
[SPEAKER_06]: On that note, Loki has effectively killed the conversation.

1355
01:40:09,746 --> 01:40:11,247
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's change things up a bit.

1356
01:40:11,788 --> 01:40:13,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I need some happy, goddammit.

1357
01:40:14,355 --> 01:40:14,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, much better.

1358
01:40:16,857 --> 01:40:22,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week here on the show, DarkSakura takes a trip down memory lane and visits a classic video game that she says, Hey!

1359
01:40:23,501 --> 01:40:24,782
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to be playing this game.

1360
01:40:25,062 --> 01:40:25,403
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing.

1361
01:40:26,003 --> 01:40:26,183
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1362
01:40:26,323 --> 01:40:27,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have to repeat what William Murderface said.

1363
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:28,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1364
01:40:29,085 --> 01:40:31,107
[SPEAKER_10]: The fallacy of correlation equals causation.

1365
01:40:33,168 --> 01:40:34,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, can we do the classic game of the week?

1366
01:40:35,349 --> 01:40:35,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1367
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:36,730
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1368
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:37,911
[SPEAKER_10]: StarTropics.

1369
01:40:40,013 --> 01:40:41,774
[SPEAKER_06]: At least you picked a really good classic game of the week.

1370
01:40:42,586 --> 01:40:44,769
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I actually didn't really play that game all that much.

1371
01:40:45,009 --> 01:40:45,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1372
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:52,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it's been such a cool... But I remember playing it and enjoying it when I did... I just never... I just got lazy.

1373
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:55,782
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's... My best friend in fourth grade and I stayed up all night playing this game.

1374
01:40:55,802 --> 01:40:57,183
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a lot of people's favorite games.

1375
01:40:57,263 --> 01:41:00,027
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like, why shouldn't I bring up Star Topics, right?

1376
01:41:00,307 --> 01:41:00,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1377
01:41:01,528 --> 01:41:03,610
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was an action-adventure RPG.

1378
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:10,454
[SPEAKER_10]: It came out by Nintendo in 1990 for the NES, and it was never released or intended to be released in Japan.

1379
01:41:10,494 --> 01:41:12,576
[SPEAKER_10]: It only came out in North America and Europe.

1380
01:41:12,996 --> 01:41:22,902
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was designed by Japanese designers who lived in the U.S., written and directed by Genyo Takeda of Nintendo Integrated Research and Development, who also gave us Punch-Out!!

1381
01:41:23,723 --> 01:41:30,287
[SPEAKER_10]: And it came out on the North American Virtual Console on January 7, 2008, and on the PAL region on January 11.

1382
01:41:31,588 --> 01:41:35,390
[SPEAKER_10]: and, of course, I had a sequel, which was Zoda's Revenge, StarTropics 2, in 1994.

1383
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:38,411
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the year I'm not telling people what I did.

1384
01:41:39,152 --> 01:41:41,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So you start off as, I graduated high school.

1385
01:41:42,173 --> 01:41:42,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1386
01:41:42,953 --> 01:41:48,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike Jones is visiting his uncle, who is named Dr. J, and he lives on Sea Island.

1387
01:41:49,176 --> 01:41:56,160
[SPEAKER_10]: And he finds that Dr. J has gone missing, and Babu, his assistant, who also sounds a lot like Baloo from The Jungle Book,

1388
01:41:57,981 --> 01:42:04,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's Mike use the submarine to basically go look for Dr. J. So it starts off all of his adventures.

1389
01:42:04,704 --> 01:42:06,424
[SPEAKER_10]: He thinks aliens are involved.

1390
01:42:07,345 --> 01:42:13,768
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically he finds Dr. J by the wreckage of an alien escape pod.

1391
01:42:14,548 --> 01:42:18,410
[SPEAKER_10]: So they think it's the Argonians.

1392
01:42:18,790 --> 01:42:20,871
[SPEAKER_10]: So he has to go to the mothership and do open stuff.

1393
01:42:21,391 --> 01:42:22,352
[SPEAKER_10]: and then Zoda comes.

1394
01:42:23,553 --> 01:42:26,875
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not going to say anymore because there's more stuff to the game than just what I'm saying.

1395
01:42:27,676 --> 01:42:29,397
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's also children adoption involved too.

1396
01:42:30,718 --> 01:42:31,619
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought I'd mention that.

1397
01:42:31,699 --> 01:42:33,000
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't adopt the children.

1398
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:33,640
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1399
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,501
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't adopt children.

1400
01:42:35,502 --> 01:42:39,865
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically it's a 2D top-down perspective kind of like Zelda in the dungeon areas.

1401
01:42:41,626 --> 01:42:50,553
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is linear, consistent storyline and the story progresses basically with talking to NPCs and doing certain actions.

1402
01:42:51,193 --> 01:42:54,917
[SPEAKER_10]: and then you have to go to your little dungeon-y areas.

1403
01:42:55,057 --> 01:43:02,143
[SPEAKER_10]: So it switches mechanics there where it has a zoomed in type of perspective.

1404
01:43:04,566 --> 01:43:15,796
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically you get weapons and items, baseball themed in many cases, and you basically, well you also get baseballs but they're called wonder horse hides.

1405
01:43:16,997 --> 01:43:24,764
[SPEAKER_10]: and Clates known as Spikes and Bolas and Shuriken and Slingshots and Mirrors and different types of stuff.

1406
01:43:25,104 --> 01:43:31,209
[SPEAKER_10]: But basically you get all kinds of things to help you progress through the game and fight all of the various baddies.

1407
01:43:33,531 --> 01:43:41,198
[SPEAKER_10]: So you get a life meter of 22 hearts, kind of like Link, in fact it looks a lot like the Legend of Zelda life bar.

1408
01:43:42,445 --> 01:43:55,630
[SPEAKER_10]: and you can find big hearts that are, again, like the heart containers in Zelda and you can get vitamin X that fills up all of your hearts even though, um, you know, you will lose, of course, health when you take damage.

1409
01:43:56,450 --> 01:44:11,496
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, you can also get try your luck signs that, um, are, you know, basically can give you extra lives in the game you only start off with three and if you lose all of your lives at the beginning of a dungeon I mean, in a dungeon then you'll have to go back to the beginning

1410
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:16,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so basically you've got, you know, your boss characters, it's RPG stuff.

1411
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:26,446
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it, you know, like I said, I didn't get to play a whole bunch of it, but I know a lot of people liked it.

1412
01:44:28,328 --> 01:44:30,089
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta talk about the letter that came with the game.

1413
01:44:30,129 --> 01:44:31,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes, there was a letter.

1414
01:44:32,451 --> 01:44:37,494
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend and I, we had no idea that this was, oh my god, it was the coolest fucking thing when you were like nine or ten.

1415
01:44:38,535 --> 01:44:40,416
[SPEAKER_10]: You get a parchment letter.

1416
01:44:41,717 --> 01:44:45,219
[SPEAKER_06]: and... It actually came with the box.

1417
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:48,320
[SPEAKER_06]: She's not talking about something you get in the game.

1418
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:50,141
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a tangible thing that came in the box.

1419
01:44:50,161 --> 01:44:51,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Made of parchment.

1420
01:44:52,543 --> 01:44:56,024
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically it has a letter from Dr. Jones addressed to Mike.

1421
01:44:56,685 --> 01:45:05,209
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, I actually did have a copy of the letter because when I rented StarTropics back in the day, they included the letter with the rental.

1422
01:45:09,697 --> 01:45:17,720
[SPEAKER_10]: But basically, it's like you intercepted the letter and were being invited to play the game on Mike's behalf.

1423
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:25,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you get a message from your uncle, Evil Aliens from a distant planet, tell Mike to dip my letter in water.

1424
01:45:26,142 --> 01:45:36,365
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have the letter, the original letter, then you could put... What was that thing with the water?

1425
01:45:36,525 --> 01:45:37,385
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a secret message?

1426
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:40,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the letter, the visible ink or whatever.

1427
01:45:40,262 --> 01:45:41,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a subcode in it.

1428
01:45:41,763 --> 01:45:44,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I think it was supposed to be able to do it without damaging the letter.

1429
01:45:45,006 --> 01:45:46,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, oh yeah, you could do it without damaging the letter.

1430
01:45:46,688 --> 01:45:49,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but you had a secret message in there.

1431
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:55,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it had like, if I remember right, there was a spot, a very specific spot where you would drip the water.

1432
01:45:56,216 --> 01:45:56,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't.

1433
01:45:57,057 --> 01:45:57,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally recall.

1434
01:45:58,117 --> 01:46:00,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I'm going to see if I can find a picture of the letter.

1435
01:46:00,378 --> 01:46:01,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the code was 747.

1436
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:02,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's actually on here.

1437
01:46:03,739 --> 01:46:06,460
[SPEAKER_10]: And they actually... Like an airplane.

1438
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:15,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo Power was asked the question enough because people that rented the game or sometimes their letter would be damaged or missing in the package.

1439
01:46:16,182 --> 01:46:18,763
[SPEAKER_10]: So Nintendo Power actually printed it after a while.

1440
01:46:19,483 --> 01:46:22,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I had to call into the hotline because I bought it used.

1441
01:46:22,901 --> 01:46:26,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's kind of one of those things that like in retrospect, it probably wasn't a very good idea.

1442
01:46:27,144 --> 01:46:30,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Ubisoft, don't pay attention to the letter thing.

1443
01:46:31,767 --> 01:46:36,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine that coming back as rights, copyright protection?

1444
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:48,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember back in the day on the, sorry, Jamie, but on the PC games, like the old school PC games, we'd have to like thumb to page 26 of the manual and read the symbol that's on there or get the plastic card that came with the game and

1445
01:46:48,797 --> 01:46:51,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, all this insane copy protection back in the day.

1446
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:52,440
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what this sounds like.

1447
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:52,800
[SPEAKER_06]: The wheels.

1448
01:46:53,901 --> 01:46:54,761
[SPEAKER_06]: But this one was cool.

1449
01:46:55,682 --> 01:47:01,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now, for Virtual Console, the letter is included in the digital manual.

1450
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:05,529
[SPEAKER_10]: And it has an image of the letter and a bucket of water at the bottom.

1451
01:47:06,049 --> 01:47:10,032
[SPEAKER_10]: So you click on the image and the letter dips into the bucket and the code shows up.

1452
01:47:10,973 --> 01:47:15,556
[SPEAKER_10]: On the European release, though, it just has a click here link at the bottom and the thing will pop up.

1453
01:47:16,801 --> 01:47:19,322
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's kind of neat that, you know, you dunk the virtual letter.

1454
01:47:19,382 --> 01:47:20,262
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cute, it's cute, yeah.

1455
01:47:20,823 --> 01:47:21,943
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna see if I can find a copy of it.

1456
01:47:21,983 --> 01:47:22,723
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll link it in the chat room.

1457
01:47:23,024 --> 01:47:23,324
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah.

1458
01:47:24,284 --> 01:47:26,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised they haven't remade that series yet.

1459
01:47:28,406 --> 01:47:29,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of surprised, too.

1460
01:47:29,926 --> 01:47:31,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they did have a sequel to StarTropics, I know.

1461
01:47:32,047 --> 01:47:33,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it was like... Zoda's Revenge.

1462
01:47:33,288 --> 01:47:35,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't Zoda's Revenge, like, the last NES game they made?

1463
01:47:36,009 --> 01:47:37,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Or no, that was Wario's Woods.

1464
01:47:37,089 --> 01:47:37,309
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them.

1465
01:47:37,689 --> 01:47:39,090
[SPEAKER_06]: It was right at the end, though.

1466
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:45,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Wario's Woods was technically the last NES game they ever made, but Zoda's Revenge was right at the end.

1467
01:47:45,713 --> 01:47:46,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we've got the letter.

1468
01:47:47,651 --> 01:47:47,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1469
01:47:48,672 --> 01:47:49,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's a bad image.

1470
01:47:51,673 --> 01:47:52,033
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

1471
01:47:53,294 --> 01:47:56,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And I am going to put a link to that in the chat room.

1472
01:47:56,775 --> 01:47:57,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it would be fun.

1473
01:47:58,456 --> 01:48:05,519
[SPEAKER_10]: If anyone wants to see, it's actually, and I love the name of the website, SocksMakePeopleSexy.net Why don't you just put it on Tumblr?

1474
01:48:05,539 --> 01:48:06,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Put it on the Tumblr.

1475
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:08,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, but I'm just going to say it to you.

1476
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:08,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1477
01:48:08,341 --> 01:48:09,061
[SPEAKER_10]: SocksMakePeopleSexy.net

1478
01:48:12,382 --> 01:48:12,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Go check it out.

1479
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:16,165
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy looks like a Rob the Robot, by the way.

1480
01:48:16,205 --> 01:48:20,348
[SPEAKER_06]: This Navcom guy in the little ship that you navigate.

1481
01:48:20,428 --> 01:48:20,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so you know.

1482
01:48:21,088 --> 01:48:22,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks just like a Rob the Robot.

1483
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:23,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow.

1484
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:24,271
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.

1485
01:48:24,311 --> 01:48:25,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Your classic game of the week.

1486
01:48:25,191 --> 01:48:26,212
[SPEAKER_06]: StarTropics.

1487
01:48:26,692 --> 01:48:27,993
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorites, too.

1488
01:48:28,073 --> 01:48:29,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Good call, DarkSakura.

1489
01:48:29,734 --> 01:48:31,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though that wasn't one that maybe you remember as fondly.

1490
01:48:32,903 --> 01:48:34,365
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a classic game for the rest of us.

1491
01:48:34,385 --> 01:48:40,930
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a few games I haven't played or haven't played a whole lot of, but that doesn't mean that other people haven't played them.

1492
01:48:41,511 --> 01:48:42,251
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1493
01:48:43,172 --> 01:48:59,726
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're going to take a quick break, guys, but when we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come, including some rapid-fire news, the FUs of the Week, the Mailbag, of course, your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR, and, of course, more phone calls when we get back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1494
01:49:05,615 --> 01:49:08,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1495
01:49:08,218 --> 01:49:14,565
[SPEAKER_06]: We are live, of course, with our 422nd episode on this July 31st of 2011.

1496
01:49:14,945 --> 01:49:17,749
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're into Part B of the show.

1497
01:49:17,769 --> 01:49:21,473
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start off Part B, as we always do, with some rapid-fire news.

1498
01:49:21,533 --> 01:49:23,415
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Loki, start us off with some rapid-fire news.

1499
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:27,063
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1500
01:49:41,717 --> 01:49:54,262
[SPEAKER_08]: To celebrate this, Harmonix is actually hooking up 30 people in America with 100 songs of their choosing, either on Xbox or PS3.

1501
01:49:55,383 --> 01:49:57,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, that's 3,000 songs.

1502
01:49:57,844 --> 01:50:04,467
[SPEAKER_08]: There's different ways to enter via Twitter, Facebook, or the Rock Band forums.

1503
01:50:06,167 --> 01:50:09,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, someone out there is going to enjoy those 100 songs if you win.

1504
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:16,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, of course, as of us recording this, it ended about a few days ago.

1505
01:50:16,418 --> 01:50:18,602
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, so much for that.

1506
01:50:18,762 --> 01:50:20,985
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you didn't enter, then it's news you lose.

1507
01:50:21,205 --> 01:50:22,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to enter too.

1508
01:50:23,084 --> 01:50:28,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, if you don't win the 100 songs, there are some other things coming out this week.

1509
01:50:29,348 --> 01:50:33,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Including, and these are all individual songs, they don't have any packs this week.

[SPEAKER_08]: Make Some Noise by the Beastie Boys.

1511
01:50:35,791 --> 01:50:36,231
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be $2.

1512
01:50:37,392 --> 01:50:39,673
[SPEAKER_08]: No Sleep to Brooklyn, also $2.

1513
01:50:40,233 --> 01:50:41,534
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's also from the Beastie Boys.

1514
01:50:43,215 --> 01:50:44,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Barracuda by Heart.

1515
01:50:45,796 --> 01:50:45,977
[SPEAKER_08]: That's $2.

1516
01:50:46,017 --> 01:50:47,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1517
01:50:47,237 --> 01:50:47,978
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty awesome.

01:50:48,778 --> 01:50:51,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Superbad Parts 1 and 2 by James Brown.

1519

01:50:59,863 --> 01:51:06,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can get some pro bass and pro guitar expansions for Barracuda and Superbad Parts 1 and 2.

1523
01:51:08,166 --> 01:51:09,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Not time for that yet, sorry.

1524
01:51:12,132 --> 01:51:24,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's funny because Duke Nukem still thinks it's popular, but Duke Nukem Forever is going to be getting some new download content, new multiplayer modes and maps this fall.

1525
01:51:24,957 --> 01:51:38,663
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to have a Hail to the Icons parody pack and it's going to have several parodies of different games, including they've got a parody of...

1526
01:51:40,464 --> 01:51:43,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Team Fortress 2, that's going to be in there.

1527
01:51:44,407 --> 01:51:47,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Two Forts, One Bridge, that's going to include hats.

1528
01:51:49,351 --> 01:51:52,393
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it says, Duke doesn't need no stinking hats.

1529
01:51:52,473 --> 01:51:55,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Give him a minigun and he'll beat off all corners.

1530
01:52:01,618 --> 01:52:08,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Inferno, Time Machine, Engage, Duke does combat in a hellish landscape of lava and teleporters.

1531
01:52:08,905 --> 01:52:11,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Who turned on the 16-bit graphics?

1532
01:52:11,628 --> 01:52:14,491
[SPEAKER_08]: More importantly, where did this DFG come from?

1533
01:52:15,311 --> 01:52:19,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha ha, you're parodying Doom, a game that's how old?

1534
01:52:20,334 --> 01:52:24,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, as old as your last game, because that's how long it took to get it out.

1535
01:52:24,616 --> 01:52:25,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha ha.

1536
01:52:26,537 --> 01:52:32,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Sandpit, player's take role of mini-Duke in a giant sandbox with two bases on either end made of child's toys.

1537
01:52:33,301 --> 01:52:36,222
[SPEAKER_08]: This map features sticky grenades and Call of Duke.

1538
01:52:36,562 --> 01:52:38,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Gee, I wonder what game that is parodying.

1539
01:52:39,964 --> 01:52:48,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Duke engages in modern combat in a war-torn city foes don't stand a chance against Duke when he spams him back with the noob tube

1540
01:52:49,901 --> 01:53:00,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and they're also going to have freeze tag, which I guess is going to be, players will be able to freeze and shatter their opponents in huge succession for points and combos.

1541
01:53:00,566 --> 01:53:01,426
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be the new mode.

1542
01:53:01,446 --> 01:53:04,808
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what the funny part about it, about all this?

1543
01:53:05,168 --> 01:53:08,309
[SPEAKER_08]: All those games that you're parodying, way better than your own game.

1544
01:53:08,429 --> 01:53:10,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha ha, joke's on you, dumbass.

1545
01:53:12,151 --> 01:53:15,374
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be coming if you bought Duke Nukem.

1546
01:53:15,734 --> 01:53:16,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you know what?

1547
01:53:16,295 --> 01:53:26,404
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time all this download content comes out, I bet you the download content will be priced higher than the actual game because it already got price dropped, by the way.

1548
01:53:26,884 --> 01:53:28,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Did it really?

1549
01:53:28,386 --> 01:53:29,146
[SPEAKER_08]: $3,999 happened this week.

1550
01:53:29,266 --> 01:53:29,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1551
01:53:30,007 --> 01:53:30,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1552
01:53:31,268 --> 01:53:32,109
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good sign.

1553
01:53:32,149 --> 01:53:35,052
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when you drop something really quick, that means it's selling well, right?

1554
01:53:35,492 --> 01:53:35,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

1555
01:53:36,353 --> 01:53:36,493
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

1556
01:53:38,232 --> 01:53:48,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and yeah, uh, Operation, uh, Rainfall, uh, apparently still not working out too well.

1557
01:53:49,483 --> 01:53:53,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Xenoblade Chronicles is not coming out over here.

1558
01:53:53,907 --> 01:53:59,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, of course, you know, this week, Nintendo released their upcoming software list, and Xenoblade Chronicles, mm,

1559
01:54:00,573 --> 01:54:01,734
[SPEAKER_08]: No way near to be found.

1560
01:54:02,055 --> 01:54:05,098
[SPEAKER_08]: It is still scheduled for release in Europe, however, on August 19th.

1561
01:54:05,678 --> 01:54:12,004
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, you know, the game has been subject of ongoing campaigns by disgruntled American RPG fans.

1562
01:54:13,005 --> 01:54:16,349
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're kind of pissed off that it's still not coming out over here.

1563
01:54:16,389 --> 01:54:20,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing as it's being localized into languages that, you know, us Americans speak.

1564
01:54:20,172 --> 01:54:23,075
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'd think it'd be easy to publish it.

1565
01:54:23,756 --> 01:54:24,877
[SPEAKER_08]: But Nintendo doesn't care.

1566
01:54:25,157 --> 01:54:27,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't they just put it on their downloadable service?

1567
01:54:28,001 --> 01:54:28,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

1568
01:54:28,782 --> 01:54:30,264
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't really have anything like that.

1569
01:54:31,486 --> 01:54:34,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have the Wii store, but... I don't know if you saw it.

1570
01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:35,451
[SPEAKER_08]: They announced this week that, guess what?

1571
01:54:35,471 --> 01:54:38,476
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to now start offering download content on the 3DS.

1572
01:54:38,836 --> 01:54:39,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard about that, yeah.

1573
01:54:39,858 --> 01:54:40,458
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like...

1574
01:54:41,079 --> 01:54:43,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, way late to the party.

1575
01:54:43,721 --> 01:54:45,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, didn't the Wii do that too?

1576
01:54:45,763 --> 01:54:54,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the Wii had Rock Band, and you could download some stuff on there, so I don't think it's exactly earth-shattering to hear that Nintendo's supporting DLC.

1577
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:55,611
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really just a matter of when.

1578
01:54:55,671 --> 01:54:56,972
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just not coming out yet.

1579
01:54:57,072 --> 01:54:59,895
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's like they haven't built the infrastructure into the 3DS.

1580
01:54:59,915 --> 01:55:01,756
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no games worth it yet.

1581
01:55:02,837 --> 01:55:08,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, now what would be interesting is Nintendo saying, we are getting on board with that.

1582
01:55:08,621 --> 01:55:10,102
[SPEAKER_06]: That would truly be something new.

1583
01:55:10,122 --> 01:55:12,003
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be like Bizarro World.

1584
01:55:12,123 --> 01:55:13,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that is something.

1585
01:55:13,424 --> 01:55:15,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario Kart with new downloadable tracks.

1586
01:55:15,505 --> 01:55:16,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1587
01:55:16,405 --> 01:55:17,966
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the story to wait for.

1588
01:55:18,046 --> 01:55:19,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what Nintendo's talking about?

1589
01:55:19,547 --> 01:55:20,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Because then that's news.

1590
01:55:22,634 --> 01:55:24,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, moving on to some other news.

1591
01:55:25,495 --> 01:55:29,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Street Fighter X Tekken is obviously on everybody's radar, especially if you're into fighting games.

1592
01:55:30,017 --> 01:55:35,279
[SPEAKER_06]: But fans of the characters Dan, that might be DarkSakura, she's a fan of Dan.

1593
01:55:35,919 --> 01:55:39,421
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a fan of Dan or a fan of Anna from Tekken, you might be disappointed.

1594
01:55:40,101 --> 01:55:43,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of them have been announced as not in the roster.

1595
01:55:43,062 --> 01:55:45,223
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, they were booted out of the game.

1596
01:55:46,164 --> 01:55:57,054
[SPEAKER_06]: The series producer Yoshinori Ono has said that those characters won't be in Street Fighter X Tekken because he was killed by a Tekken character at Comic Con last year.

1597
01:55:57,434 --> 01:56:02,219
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the real reason is, quote, as much as I personally wanted to have... Oh, I'm sorry, this is about Anna and Nina.

1598
01:56:02,999 --> 01:56:09,926
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I personally wanted to have a cool Nina and Anna tag battle, the director was against putting Anna because we already had Nina in.

1599
01:56:10,847 --> 01:56:13,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, of course, Dan probably isn't gone for real real.

1600
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:19,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I would, at this point, knowing Capcom, wait for Street Fighter X Tekken Super or whatever.

1601
01:56:19,156 --> 01:56:22,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I think Anna's going to be a palette swap for Nina.

1602
01:56:23,109 --> 01:56:25,251
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1603
01:56:50,349 --> 01:56:52,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Some soundtrack related news, quite a bit of it actually.

1604
01:56:52,891 --> 01:56:56,212
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Raiden music collection that's due out on September 28th.

1605
01:56:56,613 --> 01:57:03,276
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Team Entertainment is the record label, a four-disc compilation of music from the Raiden series called The Lightning Strikes Back.

1606
01:57:03,697 --> 01:57:10,741
[SPEAKER_06]: It will have music from Raiden the Arcade from the 90s, Raiden 2, Raiden DX, Raiden DX PlayStation, Raiden 3, and Raiden 4.

1607
01:57:11,601 --> 01:57:14,424
[SPEAKER_06]: for coming out September 28th in Japan.

1608
01:57:15,025 --> 01:57:17,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Also in soundtrack news, The King of Fighters 13.

1609
01:57:19,530 --> 01:57:25,697
[SPEAKER_06]: The pre-orders will come with 15 years of musical history, a four CD soundtrack compilation.

1610
01:57:25,717 --> 01:57:27,359
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what Atlas is putting out there.

1611
01:57:27,699 --> 01:57:29,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Try and get folks to pre-order The King of Fighters 13.

1612
01:57:29,921 --> 01:57:31,924
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool, actually.

1613
01:57:33,524 --> 01:57:36,966
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also supposed to be some exclusive game modes in the console version of the game.

1614
01:57:37,286 --> 01:57:46,169
[SPEAKER_06]: A story mode that will have new visuals and animations, a practice mode, a tutorial mode, and other stuff that wasn't in the arcade but you would expect to see in a console release of a fighter.

1615
01:57:46,649 --> 01:57:52,491
[SPEAKER_06]: One other soundtrack news, Rhythm Heaven on the Wii is getting a four-disc soundtrack.

1616
01:57:53,592 --> 01:57:58,553
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already out in Japan, Rhythm Heaven Wii, but it's coming out here as well.

1617
01:57:58,974 --> 01:57:59,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1618
01:58:01,395 --> 01:58:06,139
[SPEAKER_06]: A 4-disc CD soundtrack coming out in Japan August 24th for 4,800 yen.

1619
01:58:06,679 --> 01:58:08,360
[SPEAKER_06]: 150 songs.

1620
01:58:09,221 --> 01:58:11,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect and extended tracks included.

1621
01:58:11,883 --> 01:58:17,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly on the plate tonight, not in soundtrack news, but in sequel rumor news, TimeSplitters 4.

1622
01:58:17,447 --> 01:58:19,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Rumored that there is a version of that coming.

1623
01:58:20,169 --> 01:58:24,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess this is because of the official PlayStation Magazine UK's rumor machine section.

1624
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:28,691
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a rumor that says, quote, Gun-wielding monkeys are finally making a comeback.

1625
01:58:28,991 --> 01:58:31,691
[SPEAKER_06]: A fourth TimeSplitters title is to be announced soon.

1626
01:58:32,171 --> 01:58:37,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, it is coming from the rumors, but when you consider it's the official PlayStation Magazine.

1627
01:58:37,112 --> 01:58:38,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I love me some TimeSplitters.

1628
01:58:38,272 --> 01:58:41,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I bet you're excited about that, so we will see.

1629
01:58:42,913 --> 01:58:44,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Not until they actually announce something.

1630
01:58:45,474 --> 01:58:48,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they've been talking to TimeSplitters for a long time now.

1631
01:58:49,683 --> 01:58:50,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to DarkSakura.

1632
01:58:52,503 --> 01:58:54,663
[SPEAKER_10]: In other news, we have the Endermen.

1633
01:58:54,763 --> 01:58:55,864
[SPEAKER_10]: They're coming for you.

1634
01:58:56,484 --> 01:58:57,544
[SPEAKER_10]: They're actually a new Minecraft mob.

1635
01:58:58,204 --> 01:59:03,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're just little black stick figures with... Like everything in Minecraft.

1636
01:59:04,845 --> 01:59:05,445
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're all black.

1637
01:59:06,085 --> 01:59:17,468
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually remind me of... Do you ever remember in Mario Galaxy where there were the little black guys that were standing on top of the world but you couldn't get to them and they would just watch you?

1638
01:59:18,128 --> 01:59:19,148
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they look like to me.

1639
01:59:19,688 --> 01:59:19,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.

1640
01:59:21,089 --> 01:59:48,791
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're just there to be scary like they're there to terrify you so that's all they're there for and they're going to be in the next Minecraft update it's based off of I guess a character that was made on the something awful forums Slenderman which I watched they have this ARG it's called like Marvel something I forget what it's called and really creepy really really creepy

1641
01:59:50,003 --> 01:59:54,566
[SPEAKER_10]: The Slender Man's also been thrown in a number of other video games too, just in background stuff.

1642
01:59:56,087 --> 01:59:57,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Very creepy.

1643
01:59:57,268 --> 02:00:06,953
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll basically stand still moving blocks around stuff, but if you move your reticle over them, they'll stare at you and then they'll charge at you.

1644
02:00:08,054 --> 02:00:10,035
[SPEAKER_08]: And they can teleport and kill you.

1645
02:00:12,957 --> 02:00:16,219
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually going to link a picture in the chat room so they can see what it looks like.

1646
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,980
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1647
02:00:18,642 --> 02:00:22,705
[SPEAKER_10]: So, moving forward, we also have something from Disney.

1648
02:00:23,106 --> 02:00:28,670
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to buy UTV Ignition for $454 million.

1649
02:00:32,153 --> 02:00:40,879
[SPEAKER_10]: This actually news comes from Develop, and it says that Disney already owns 50.4% of UTV, and they're wanting to acquire the whole thing for its Bollywood films and TV shows.

1650
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:42,980
[SPEAKER_10]: So, who knows?

1651
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:45,781
[SPEAKER_10]: But they own Ignition, so that means there might be some issues.

1652
02:00:46,901 --> 02:00:53,983
[SPEAKER_10]: And last but never least, and related to Disney a bit, Toy Story download content is coming for LittleBigPlanet 2.

1653
02:00:54,583 --> 02:00:59,604
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be, and actually it's going to be on August 3rd in the UK.

1654
02:00:59,664 --> 02:01:00,604
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be £4.79 or €5.99.

1655
02:01:05,465 --> 02:01:12,231
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's nine Toy Story themed levels with two cut scenes, five levels and two mini levels.

1656
02:01:13,272 --> 02:01:20,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Two new music tracks, one new interactive music track, one new level background, five materials, ten decorations, six objects, and 149 stickers.

1657
02:01:22,219 --> 02:01:22,799
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty rad.

1658
02:01:22,839 --> 02:01:30,361
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the costume pack, which is going to cost the same, has Buzz Lightyear gloves, helmet, legs, teeth, and body.

1659
02:01:30,421 --> 02:01:37,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there's Slinky Dog set that has the feet, ears, hands, nose, skin, body, and tail.

1660
02:01:37,723 --> 02:01:40,344
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Ham, which is a head, skin, and body.

1661
02:01:41,024 --> 02:01:44,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And Rex, which is the claws, head, skin, and body.

1662
02:01:44,865 --> 02:01:49,566
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you can also, though, download each set individually for £1.59 or for €1.99 euro.

1663
02:01:53,168 --> 02:01:54,849
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1664
02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:17,321
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, do check out another show that we produce here.

1665
02:02:17,601 --> 02:02:21,063
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth at www.hordehouse.com.

1666
02:02:21,323 --> 02:02:22,883
[SPEAKER_06]: It's myself and my buddy, Extifer.

1667
02:02:23,324 --> 02:02:29,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And this week we had special guest, Ferare, one of the guild leaders for Extifer's guild on Talking Smack About WoW.

1668
02:02:30,026 --> 02:02:32,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Some really good Firelands and raiding discussion this week.

1669
02:02:32,147 --> 02:02:35,149
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're a fan of WoW, check that out again, hordehouse.com.

1670
02:02:35,229 --> 02:02:35,669
[SPEAKER_06]: One more day.

1671
02:02:36,209 --> 02:02:36,929
[SPEAKER_06]: What's one more day?

1672
02:02:37,289 --> 02:02:39,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you get your last Firelands vendor, right?

1673
02:02:39,090 --> 02:02:39,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1674
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:40,351
[SPEAKER_06]: You know you get a new mount from that.

1675
02:02:40,631 --> 02:02:41,111
[SPEAKER_09]: I know!

1676
02:02:41,191 --> 02:02:42,652
[SPEAKER_06]: You get like a little firebird thing.

1677
02:02:42,672 --> 02:02:42,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I know!

1678
02:02:43,092 --> 02:02:44,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Salacious Pop got that the other day.

1679
02:02:44,472 --> 02:02:45,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know, I know, I know.

1680
02:02:45,833 --> 02:02:47,533
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be getting to ride a flaming bird.

1681
02:02:48,414 --> 02:02:48,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1682
02:02:49,094 --> 02:02:49,374
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1683
02:02:50,374 --> 02:03:01,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the third podcast is probably delayed a little bit considering there's some personal stuff going on and so forth, but we are still eyeing that at least by Labor Day, no later than that.

1684
02:03:02,499 --> 02:03:04,700
[SPEAKER_10]: We've already got things definitely in motion.

1685
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:04,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1686
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:06,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So, more hints coming.

1687
02:03:07,121 --> 02:03:09,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of you have been begging me on Twitter for more information about that.

1688
02:03:09,801 --> 02:03:17,663
[SPEAKER_06]: So, all I will say is that, you know, certain components of this show, if you like it, you're going to really like the new show.

1689
02:03:18,544 --> 02:03:21,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, oh well, you still got this show.

1690
02:03:21,424 --> 02:03:22,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's all free, so don't complain.

1691
02:03:22,925 --> 02:03:26,306
[SPEAKER_06]: And they might learn a thing or two.

1692
02:03:26,626 --> 02:03:27,366
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, you might.

1693
02:03:28,714 --> 02:03:30,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I want to say this.

1694
02:03:31,135 --> 02:03:33,935
[SPEAKER_06]: A new segment coming to OLR, actually.

1695
02:03:33,955 --> 02:03:36,155
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how we have some segments we like to do on the show?

1696
02:03:36,695 --> 02:03:38,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, a lot of things you're very used to.

1697
02:03:38,756 --> 02:03:43,157
[SPEAKER_06]: The Twitter topics, the Skype line we do at the end of the show, Classic Game of the Week and so forth.

1698
02:03:43,937 --> 02:03:45,297
[SPEAKER_06]: We've kind of talked amongst ourselves.

1699
02:03:45,697 --> 02:03:48,418
[SPEAKER_06]: We like to mix it up once in a while at OLR.

1700
02:03:48,478 --> 02:03:52,398
[SPEAKER_06]: While we have a formula that works for us, once in a while we want to mix it up.

1701
02:03:52,558 --> 02:03:56,739
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing we want to feature more on the program is indie games.

1702
02:03:57,279 --> 02:03:59,501
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to have a new segment starting soon.

1703
02:03:59,561 --> 02:04:00,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say exactly when.

1704
02:04:00,641 --> 02:04:02,463
[SPEAKER_06]: It just depends when I can get some folks on the show.

1705
02:04:02,803 --> 02:04:04,604
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're actually going to spotlight indie games.

1706
02:04:04,984 --> 02:04:16,893
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a name for the segment yet, but we are going to have – or I guess I should say invite developers onto the show to talk about their passion, their game, and share our space with the indie developers.

1707
02:04:16,973 --> 02:04:20,355
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had some on in the past in more full interview capacity.

1708
02:04:20,655 --> 02:04:21,676
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1709
02:04:48,789 --> 02:04:49,129
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1710
02:05:10,623 --> 02:05:40,329
[SPEAKER_06]: so if you are a developer that wants to have your indie game featured on the show I would like to keep it to relatively new releases but in the beginning I won't be too picky but something that's been out in the past few months or so do drop me an email you can email me personally rob at orange lounge radio dot com or you can always drop the general email bag as well mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com we'll get you in touch with who you need to get in touch with so that is coming to the show soon whenever we get enough stuff in the pipeline where we have some things to feature we're going to spotlight that here in the show

1711
02:05:40,549 --> 02:05:41,089
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited.

1712
02:05:41,469 --> 02:05:45,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Just think about it like the classic game of the week, but now it's going to be the indie game of the week.

1713
02:05:45,810 --> 02:05:46,511
[SPEAKER_06]: The new classics.

1714
02:05:46,771 --> 02:05:48,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess you could think about it that way.

1715
02:05:48,591 --> 02:05:51,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And it won't just be DarkSakura telling you about it.

1716
02:05:51,152 --> 02:05:53,192
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to have a discussion with the developer.

1717
02:05:53,833 --> 02:05:58,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Although if a week goes by where maybe we're having a hard time getting somebody, we'll talk about something that caught our eye.

1718
02:05:59,654 --> 02:06:01,336
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1719
02:06:20,976 --> 02:06:29,060
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's so adorable and all the characters are little 8-bit characters and they look so cute and they have their little bit books that they update and you know what I really love?

1720
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:30,620
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one called Tiny Zoo.

1721
02:06:30,941 --> 02:06:32,261
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I love about Tiny Tower?

1722
02:06:32,781 --> 02:06:34,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you this about Tiny Tower.

1723
02:06:35,062 --> 02:06:46,768
[SPEAKER_06]: What I love about it is that yes, it's free to play and they have these whole tower bucks things and if you want to buy the tower bucks you can do that and move the game a lot faster but

1724
02:06:47,268 --> 02:07:02,740
[SPEAKER_06]: but you don't have to because once in a while and more so than in most free-to-play games you'll get tipped a tower buck or you'll get tower bucks as little incentive rewards and so it helps to move the game along a little bit and what I also love about it is that if you forget to check your tower for three weeks

1725
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:06,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well, the lights were dark for three weeks and you didn't make any money.

1726
02:07:06,582 --> 02:07:08,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Your citizens don't move out.

1727
02:07:08,483 --> 02:07:10,444
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't burn the building down in protest.

1728
02:07:10,904 --> 02:07:14,606
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, it doesn't require your tender, loving care all the time.

1729
02:07:14,906 --> 02:07:16,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to play it every day, you can.

1730
02:07:16,667 --> 02:07:17,767
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to play it once a week, you can.

1731
02:07:18,127 --> 02:07:22,570
[SPEAKER_06]: That is good design, in my opinion, and where the freemium model should go.

1732
02:07:23,290 --> 02:07:25,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do know people that have spent money on Tiny Tower.

1733
02:07:26,332 --> 02:07:29,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't, but I think if people want to, they can.

1734
02:07:30,113 --> 02:07:30,554
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1735
02:07:31,514 --> 02:07:38,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so I'm looking at our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and it does look like some folks in chat are excited about the whole indie games.

1736
02:07:40,522 --> 02:07:41,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Talking about that segment coming up.

1737
02:07:42,063 --> 02:07:44,365
[SPEAKER_06]: And Actdeft there says, Woo!

1738
02:07:44,485 --> 02:07:45,626
[SPEAKER_06]: New OLR segment.

1739
02:07:46,927 --> 02:07:51,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Breakman in chat says, How will any of you ever have the time to actually play games?

1740
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:52,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Talking about the third podcast.

1741
02:07:53,232 --> 02:07:53,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say this much.

1742
02:07:53,933 --> 02:07:54,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I'm not working.

1743
02:07:54,593 --> 02:07:55,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1744
02:07:56,615 --> 02:07:56,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I am.

1745
02:07:57,755 --> 02:07:59,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Adding a third podcast to the plate is going to be something.

1746
02:07:59,937 --> 02:08:07,742
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be a long show and it's going to be something where we can record several of them in a day and produce it regularly.

1747
02:08:07,802 --> 02:08:08,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to lie.

1748
02:08:08,462 --> 02:08:09,503
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way it's going to be done.

1749
02:08:10,043 --> 02:08:11,684
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think you guys will get a kick out of it.

1750
02:08:11,924 --> 02:08:14,746
[SPEAKER_06]: It is going to be myself, DarkSakura, and Dan.

1751
02:08:15,171 --> 02:08:19,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki is, of course, always welcome whenever he wants to come on, but he's got other stuff he's got to do, too.

1752
02:08:19,753 --> 02:08:23,514
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dan, of course, is going to add a whole new element, especially when we tell you more about what it's about.

1753
02:08:24,535 --> 02:08:26,235
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be great.

1754
02:08:29,376 --> 02:08:29,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1755
02:08:31,337 --> 02:08:31,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1756
02:08:31,777 --> 02:08:34,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Breakman in the chat says, Xbox Live Indie Games.

1757
02:08:34,158 --> 02:08:35,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Those devs need to call OLR.

1758
02:08:36,279 --> 02:08:36,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

1759
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:38,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So please, again, get in touch with me.

1760
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:40,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

1761
02:08:40,140 --> 02:08:40,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Who wants to be first?

1762
02:08:43,082 --> 02:09:01,153
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's see Misty about Tiny Tower in chat says hey protest burning might be funny once anyway at least I do agree it would be nice to see them do like a little more with some of the events and so forth but the game is still early in its life and I'm sure there'll be update patches and so forth now that's iOS gaming done well I'm gonna tell you what iOS game blows

1763
02:09:01,957 --> 02:09:02,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely blows.

1764
02:09:03,518 --> 02:09:04,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom Arcade.

1765
02:09:05,339 --> 02:09:06,059
[SPEAKER_06]: You check this out?

1766
02:09:06,419 --> 02:09:18,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom Arcade, you can play classic Capcom Arcade games like 1942 and, I don't know, what else is in the... Ghosts and Goblins and Street Fighter and all that.

1767
02:09:18,845 --> 02:09:19,605
[SPEAKER_06]: You can play those.

1768
02:09:20,086 --> 02:09:22,487
[SPEAKER_06]: The deal is you can play like three games...

1769
02:09:23,187 --> 02:09:24,468
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1770
02:09:46,584 --> 02:09:47,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1771
02:10:03,477 --> 02:10:24,948
[SPEAKER_06]: and I was like the music kept going so I knew that the emulation was still running but the game itself just froze and I was like did anybody fucking test this or did they just decide to just put this shit out and see who'd buy it because it seemed to me like option B so yet another strike from Capcom this week that Capcom Arcade needs to be tested better it sucks

1772
02:10:26,795 --> 02:10:28,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, so there you go.

1773
02:10:28,776 --> 02:10:30,417
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my iOS talk.

1774
02:10:30,978 --> 02:10:32,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get back into some other news.

1775
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:35,941
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll do some long news with Loki.

1776
02:10:36,755 --> 02:10:37,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1777
02:10:39,336 --> 02:10:50,660
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and since we were talking a little bit about Capcom, and they made an errant judgment, if you will, back with Resident Evil Mercenaries, where they said, hey, you know what?

1778
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:54,541
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to make it impossible for you to erase your game to save.

1779
02:10:54,801 --> 02:11:00,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody was pissed, and hopefully we figured that maybe people learned by that lesson.

1780
02:11:01,503 --> 02:11:02,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no.

1781
02:11:03,324 --> 02:11:12,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions from Namco also features a problem where your save files are permanent and unable to be reset or erased.

1782
02:11:14,608 --> 02:11:21,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, they put this out, and according to Wired's Game Life blog,

1783
02:11:23,339 --> 02:11:26,702
[SPEAKER_08]: There's simply no way to erase a save once it's been written to the cartridge.

1784
02:11:26,722 --> 02:11:32,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I've looked all over, even going as far as to ask a Namco Bandai representative, and it doesn't seem like there's a way to erase a save game.

1785
02:11:33,587 --> 02:11:46,078
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, you know, basically saying that the design doesn't just affect earned in-game awards, which can't be deleted, but also high scores, meaning that the most recent high score is the only one that the game records.

1786
02:11:47,319 --> 02:11:47,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1787
02:11:48,820 --> 02:11:58,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, though, Namco, they have come to an explanation for it, and they're saying that... Here's how it works.

1788
02:12:01,144 --> 02:12:02,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Pac-Man Tilt.

1789
02:12:02,144 --> 02:12:06,566
[SPEAKER_08]: It says the plus high score from the EX Level 1.

1790
02:12:06,826 --> 02:12:09,847
[SPEAKER_08]: It says it needs to open 10 medals.

1791
02:12:10,447 --> 02:12:13,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't really see what the high scores are here.

1792
02:12:14,288 --> 02:12:20,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Score ranking keeps one of each of the top scores mentioned above to submit to online ranking boards.

1793
02:12:20,510 --> 02:12:24,132
[SPEAKER_08]: It keeps the gamer's name in which the player can input via on-screen keyboard.

1794
02:12:27,017 --> 02:12:30,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it doesn't really say why they did that.

1795
02:12:30,058 --> 02:12:32,419
[SPEAKER_08]: It just shows how it's affected.

1796
02:12:33,039 --> 02:12:41,022
[SPEAKER_08]: They said they confirmed that players have the option to share high scores online, but using the same cartridge in different DS main posts to score twice.

1797
02:12:42,162 --> 02:12:42,402
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1798
02:12:42,842 --> 02:12:46,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Namco Bandai didn't comment on the decision-making process behind it.

1799
02:12:48,344 --> 02:12:49,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like no decision was made.

1800
02:12:50,005 --> 02:12:52,986
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like just bad design again.

1801
02:12:55,259 --> 02:13:07,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, other than, you know, it says, but they were the copy, Capcom's response would say that it was an attempt to preserve the game's arcade-style feel and it would never do it again.

1802
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:10,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, you know, here's my thing.

1803
02:13:11,663 --> 02:13:19,006
[SPEAKER_08]: The 3DS, okay, you've got very little penetration for the 3DS out there right now.

1804
02:13:19,646 --> 02:13:24,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you really need to hinder sales of any game on that system?

1805
02:13:24,787 --> 02:13:30,729
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions, I don't know about you, but that's not really at the top of my list of games.

1806
02:13:31,089 --> 02:13:35,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're great on Xbox Live Arcade, and it sounds like that's where they're going to remain great.

1807
02:13:36,501 --> 02:13:38,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but it's just like, really?

1808
02:13:39,603 --> 02:13:40,624
[SPEAKER_08]: You thought that was a good idea?

1809
02:13:40,644 --> 02:13:51,310
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that concerns me here, I mean, and I would say, I might have been interested in these games if the price was right, but again, this whole save file thing, I can't support this.

1810
02:13:51,771 --> 02:13:55,613
[SPEAKER_06]: The excuse they're giving just fucking doesn't make sense.

1811
02:13:56,253 --> 02:13:57,814
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really talking us in circles.

1812
02:13:57,834 --> 02:13:59,195
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they didn't really have an excuse.

1813
02:13:59,695 --> 02:14:00,656
[SPEAKER_08]: They gave no excuse.

1814
02:14:00,876 --> 02:14:08,672
[SPEAKER_06]: This concerns me because we have two companies that have made the same mistake that's very fishy.

1815
02:14:10,177 --> 02:14:12,219
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's the whole used game market, right?

1816
02:14:12,639 --> 02:14:17,444
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really fishy to me that we have two companies that have now done this.

1817
02:14:17,744 --> 02:14:18,785
[SPEAKER_08]: You do understand people.

1818
02:14:18,925 --> 02:14:20,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this a trend?

1819
02:14:20,367 --> 02:14:22,569
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't going to stop you.

1820
02:14:22,709 --> 02:14:26,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yeah, it will stop used game sales.

1821
02:14:26,252 --> 02:14:28,755
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how it's going to stop used game sales or at least hinder it?

1822
02:14:28,975 --> 02:14:30,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop new game sales?

1823
02:14:30,196 --> 02:14:32,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, because people aren't going to buy the new game.

1824
02:14:32,558 --> 02:14:35,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you're going to buy a game, which, you know,

1825
02:14:36,684 --> 02:14:40,607
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop may decide, hey, you know what, we're not going to take it back because you can't erase a save game.

1826
02:14:40,867 --> 02:14:43,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, they haven't made the decision permanently so far.

1827
02:14:43,790 --> 02:14:47,933
[SPEAKER_08]: They did at one time with Resident Evil where they said, oh, we're not going to take it back, and then they changed that.

1828
02:14:48,373 --> 02:15:00,924
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, if they do this, then, you know, a consumer that realizes, you know what, I'm going to play this game for a while, then I'm probably going to get sick of it, and I'm going to sell it and get some money for something else...

1829
02:15:01,704 --> 02:15:04,385
[SPEAKER_08]: If they can't sell it back, they may not buy it.

1830
02:15:04,865 --> 02:15:05,365
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1831
02:15:05,465 --> 02:15:07,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just skip buying that.

1832
02:15:07,386 --> 02:15:08,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll wait until another game comes out.

1833
02:15:10,087 --> 02:15:12,808
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just... It's dumb.

1834
02:15:13,148 --> 02:15:14,188
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really a dumb idea.

1835
02:15:14,948 --> 02:15:22,551
[SPEAKER_08]: And why you should be limited... Why even at all games should be saved to the carts that they're on instead of your system?

1836
02:15:22,751 --> 02:15:26,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Your 3DS, which has a goddamn SD card in it,

1837
02:15:26,992 --> 02:15:55,275
[SPEAKER_08]: everyone comes with one not even something you have to buy separately like on most PSPs and you can save to that I don't understand why you can't do that that's stupid you know with the DS it made sense because there was no saving whatsoever to the system there was no storage of any sort whatsoever but this is the 3DS come on jump into the century where you know what we can store data to these cards

1838
02:15:57,001 --> 02:16:01,683
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like Namco could have heard what Capcom did and then made the decision.

1839
02:16:01,803 --> 02:16:07,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of these companies made this conscious decision to design the saves this way months ago.

1840
02:16:07,345 --> 02:16:08,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is weird to me.

1841
02:16:09,486 --> 02:16:11,347
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like somebody put them up to it.

1842
02:16:12,667 --> 02:16:15,148
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what strikes me as just really weird.

1843
02:16:15,448 --> 02:16:17,048
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I hope this trend stops.

1844
02:16:17,728 --> 02:16:18,989
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet again, another game.

1845
02:16:19,569 --> 02:16:25,610
[SPEAKER_06]: But this one, unlike the Capcom game, this was one I was legitimately like, oh, I really do love Pac-Man Championship Edition.

1846
02:16:25,670 --> 02:16:29,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't mind a portable version of it, you know, if it was like 1999 maybe.

1847
02:16:29,591 --> 02:16:33,952
[SPEAKER_06]: But now, nope, not going to do it because I'm not going to support this type of game design.

1848
02:16:35,824 --> 02:16:40,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I do tend to buy most of my games new, and I don't sell a lot of them back.

1849
02:16:40,186 --> 02:16:41,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Very rarely do I sell games back.

1850
02:16:41,827 --> 02:16:44,808
[SPEAKER_06]: The last game I remember distinctly selling back was Top Spin 3.

1851
02:16:46,649 --> 02:16:50,950
[SPEAKER_06]: And just a handful of GameCube and old first generation Xbox 360 games.

1852
02:16:53,709 --> 02:16:58,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, more news about the Xbox 360 anyway, since I brought it up there.

1853
02:16:58,794 --> 02:17:04,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Free-to-play games apparently are inevitable on the Xbox 360, at least according to one publisher.

1854
02:17:05,421 --> 02:17:09,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Todd Harris of Hi-Rez Studios, who makes the game Tribes Ascend.

1855
02:17:10,026 --> 02:17:13,970
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a multiplayer first-person shooter coming to the PC and hopefully someday the 360.

1856
02:17:15,671 --> 02:17:31,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Todd Harris says quote at least from our conversations both Sony and Microsoft are moving there strategically but there are still some things to be worked out on both the business side and the technical side of the certification side that's a tongue twister regarding frequency of patches

1857
02:17:31,958 --> 02:17:37,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Those issues just need further advancement before we would be comfortable putting a release timeframe on the console version.

1858
02:17:37,541 --> 02:17:42,823
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the case of never, but we know all those things we can handle on the PC, so that's why PC is first.

1859
02:17:43,344 --> 02:17:43,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1860
02:17:43,824 --> 02:17:45,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I remember hearing something about this.

1861
02:17:45,565 --> 02:17:49,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't Microsoft limit you to the number of patches you're able to do within the release?

1862
02:17:49,546 --> 02:17:50,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.

1863
02:17:50,027 --> 02:17:51,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you have to pay for that or something.

1864
02:17:51,807 --> 02:17:54,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's why, because free-to-play games...

1865
02:17:56,149 --> 02:17:57,190
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1866
02:18:18,703 --> 02:18:19,464
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1867
02:18:36,588 --> 02:18:37,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, that's the sad part.

1868
02:18:38,669 --> 02:18:44,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and Breakman comments in our chatroom at chat.org.com Xbox has already had free-to-play games.

1869
02:18:44,510 --> 02:18:45,091
[SPEAKER_06]: One versus 100.

1870
02:18:45,751 --> 02:18:46,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad it didn't last.

1871
02:18:46,731 --> 02:18:47,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

1872
02:18:47,791 --> 02:18:51,993
[SPEAKER_06]: One versus 100 wasn't an MMO per se, but it was a free-to-play game, sure.

1873
02:18:52,153 --> 02:18:57,894
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Microsoft-backed, for one, but everybody, well, at least a lot of people I know miss it dearly.

1874
02:18:57,954 --> 02:18:59,455
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a freemium game, though.

1875
02:18:59,475 --> 02:19:03,116
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know, though, that Marvel's MMO is going to be free-to-play.

1876
02:19:04,296 --> 02:19:05,157
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, I remember hearing that.

1877
02:19:05,177 --> 02:19:05,477
[SPEAKER_06]: With Deadpool.

1878
02:19:05,577 --> 02:19:06,137
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not going to be on 360.

1879
02:19:06,177 --> 02:19:06,337
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1880
02:19:06,437 --> 02:19:07,978
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a PC game.

1881
02:19:07,998 --> 02:19:08,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but still.

1882
02:19:08,878 --> 02:19:09,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1883
02:19:10,599 --> 02:19:13,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

1884
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:18,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read your emails.

1885
02:19:19,103 --> 02:19:19,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Live here on air.

1886
02:19:21,846 --> 02:19:23,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I gotta say this live.

1887
02:19:23,087 --> 02:19:24,167
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really funny, just live.

1888
02:19:24,467 --> 02:19:26,208
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a little net split live.

1889
02:19:26,228 --> 02:19:28,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you've ever been in IRC, you know what a net split is.

1890
02:19:28,950 --> 02:19:33,472
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess Loki's on one side of the net split and I'm on another.

1891
02:19:33,492 --> 02:19:36,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I could see that Loki just left the room.

1892
02:19:37,014 --> 02:19:39,956
[SPEAKER_08]: It's me on an island with Black Wolf and Dark Tetsuya.

1893
02:19:40,336 --> 02:19:41,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and everybody's back.

1894
02:19:41,657 --> 02:19:42,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just reconnected.

1895
02:19:42,517 --> 02:19:42,857
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1896
02:19:44,238 --> 02:19:44,939
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of funny.

1897
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:45,841
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1898
02:19:47,063 --> 02:19:47,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, internets.

1899
02:19:48,085 --> 02:19:49,828
[SPEAKER_06]: You never cease to amaze me.

1900
02:19:49,848 --> 02:19:50,810
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on.

1901
02:19:50,990 --> 02:19:51,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag.

1902
02:19:51,471 --> 02:19:55,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, mailbag that thing.

1903
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:56,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we got two.

1904
02:19:58,001 --> 02:20:00,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to double check and see if we got any more real quick.

1905
02:20:00,443 --> 02:20:01,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, just two.

1906
02:20:01,503 --> 02:20:02,144
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the first one.

1907
02:20:02,464 --> 02:20:03,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, guys.

1908
02:20:03,425 --> 02:20:03,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.

1909
02:20:04,105 --> 02:20:06,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wondering, do you know of any smaller Xbox controllers?

1910
02:20:07,327 --> 02:20:15,333
[SPEAKER_10]: The current ones are so big, and the way the buttons are situated, I can only play for about 10 minutes because I also have arthritis.

1911
02:20:15,893 --> 02:20:21,817
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really irritating as I bought Dragon Age 2, but haven't been able to really progress because I can't really do the attacks.

1912
02:20:22,177 --> 02:20:23,898
[SPEAKER_10]: And the ones I can do really bother my hands.

1913
02:20:24,078 --> 02:20:27,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Holly D. Well, they all come with a smaller...

1914
02:20:28,281 --> 02:20:28,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of the bag, broken.

1915
02:20:50,619 --> 02:20:54,420
[SPEAKER_06]: What about like, I mean, I know she might be thinking smaller, but what about thinking bigger?

1916
02:20:54,981 --> 02:20:56,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what about an arcade stick?

1917
02:20:56,481 --> 02:20:57,602
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what my suggestion was.

1918
02:20:57,622 --> 02:21:00,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I have, I've had hand surgery twice on my right hand.

1919
02:21:01,363 --> 02:21:06,766
[SPEAKER_10]: So it gets really stiff really easily and my fingers will lock up because I still need to have one of the finger worked on.

1920
02:21:07,786 --> 02:21:16,331
[SPEAKER_10]: But, like, for example, I can play Dragon Age 2 just fine because I use my thumb and forefinger for a lot of stuff and neither of those are ones that have problems.

1921
02:21:16,711 --> 02:21:22,274
[SPEAKER_10]: But I cannot play fighting games very well because I'm moving so fast and my hand will start cramping up.

1922
02:21:22,814 --> 02:21:33,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I found is that using the joystick, you know, like we have the tournament stick and we've got the Xbox joystick, which you can probably find at a used game store somewhere for cheap.

1923
02:21:36,462 --> 02:22:00,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem so something like that will work a situation like that is tough too because you really need to get your no pun intended you need to get your hands on a controller to actually try it before you buy it so I would really suggest you head out to something where they tend to have those things out for you to try like maybe Best Buy I know Fry's but they're more west coast Fry's always seems to have that kind of stuff out at least the arcade sticks but I know they don't have those everywhere

1924
02:22:01,516 --> 02:22:02,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully there's a store near you.

1925
02:22:02,819 --> 02:22:08,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe even an independent store might be a way to go where they would have some of that stuff out for you to try it and see how your hand takes to that.

1926
02:22:09,144 --> 02:22:21,873
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, speaking of the controllers they have out at Fry's, they have a six-button PlayStation controller that's third-party but supported by Sony that's super comfortable.

1927
02:22:22,714 --> 02:22:31,920
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, maybe see how that likes and then see if the same distributor makes another pad like it because I found that to be really comfortable and it was just a six-button fighting stick.

1928
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:36,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I was playing Super Street Fighter 4 with it at Fry's.

1929
02:22:37,764 --> 02:22:38,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1930
02:22:38,164 --> 02:22:38,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1931
02:22:39,145 --> 02:22:40,185
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was that email.

1932
02:22:40,305 --> 02:22:41,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the last one.

1933
02:22:42,146 --> 02:22:43,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Just two quick unrelated questions.

1934
02:22:45,287 --> 02:22:53,529
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, is there an online multiplayer game that varies the audio of voice chat or availability of text chat based on proximity?

1935
02:22:54,409 --> 02:22:59,331
[SPEAKER_10]: A character closer to you would sound louder, while players across the map couldn't be heard at all.

1936
02:22:59,871 --> 02:23:03,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't gotten my feet wet with it, but I suggest World of Warcraft would do something like this.

1937
02:23:03,712 --> 02:23:04,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it does.

1938
02:23:04,676 --> 02:23:05,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not.

1939
02:23:05,217 --> 02:23:08,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And the voice chat that's built into WoW kind of has a reputation for sucking.

1940
02:23:09,001 --> 02:23:14,067
[SPEAKER_06]: They tried to build it so that people wouldn't have to get what's called Ventrilo servers or TeamSpeak some people use.

1941
02:23:15,068 --> 02:23:17,330
[SPEAKER_06]: But folks tend to rely on the Ventrilo servers.

1942
02:23:17,631 --> 02:23:18,472
[SPEAKER_10]: With characters though?

1943
02:23:19,453 --> 02:23:21,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, your proximity does change with NPCs.

1944
02:23:24,250 --> 02:23:27,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but... If your sound drivers will support it.

1945
02:23:27,471 --> 02:23:28,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but not other people.

1946
02:23:28,731 --> 02:23:30,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's thinking like a person-to-person game.

1947
02:23:30,712 --> 02:23:33,473
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what game comes to mind to me for some reason is Halo.

1948
02:23:33,553 --> 02:23:34,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't Halo do that?

1949
02:23:34,453 --> 02:23:36,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Or specifically Halo 2 and Halo 3?

1950
02:23:36,814 --> 02:23:37,614
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but he says a character.

1951
02:23:37,634 --> 02:23:40,255
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not saying... Oh, he said a character.

1952
02:23:40,335 --> 02:23:41,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, WoW does that.

1953
02:23:41,855 --> 02:23:42,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, WoW does that.

1954
02:23:43,676 --> 02:23:48,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... WoW will also pan left to right, depending on your sound card.

1955
02:23:49,117 --> 02:23:49,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1956
02:23:50,658 --> 02:23:50,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1957
02:23:52,975 --> 02:24:06,831
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that area noises in Portal 2, and also the loudspeaker in Portal 2, based on where you are, the loudspeaker will project a different way depending on the texture of the walls and where you are.

1958
02:24:07,352 --> 02:24:07,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you remember that?

1959
02:24:09,174 --> 02:24:10,455
[SPEAKER_10]: So the echo will be different.

1960
02:24:13,530 --> 02:24:17,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and when you're talking to, I don't care, spoilers, it's been out already.

1961
02:24:17,712 --> 02:24:24,155
[SPEAKER_10]: When you're talking to Potatoes through the glass wall, she's a little quieter than when you're actually right in front of her.

1962
02:24:25,115 --> 02:24:32,299
[SPEAKER_10]: So, a lot more games are doing that, but really a lot of it also has to do with your sound card and playing stereo versus mono.

1963
02:24:33,199 --> 02:24:34,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the second question.

1964
02:24:34,220 --> 02:24:37,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick, Tiger Call on our chatroom says, they still use Ventrilo?

1965
02:24:37,181 --> 02:24:38,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Ventrilo harassment comes to mind.

1966
02:24:38,922 --> 02:24:39,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've seen those YouTubes.

1967
02:24:40,883 --> 02:24:41,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1968
02:24:41,363 --> 02:24:48,090
[SPEAKER_10]: For the record, on Star Trek Online, which by the way also does the distance based, I use TeamSpeak.

1969
02:24:49,012 --> 02:24:49,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't do any of that.

1970
02:24:50,253 --> 02:24:51,034
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like Ventrilo.

1971
02:24:51,505 --> 02:24:54,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Ventrilo for Ragnarok For the record, I do prefer Ventrilo versus TeamSpeak

1972
02:25:14,096 --> 02:25:17,039
[SPEAKER_10]: What tense is used in phrases such as will have happened?

1973
02:25:17,059 --> 02:25:17,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Future Perfect

1974
02:25:35,319 --> 02:25:35,920
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have happened.

1975
02:25:37,001 --> 02:25:46,991
[SPEAKER_10]: When you're referring to anything that is a future event happening, but in that future point where it has already happened, it's future perfect.

1976
02:25:47,351 --> 02:25:47,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1977
02:25:47,772 --> 02:25:49,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought we were a video game show.

1978
02:25:49,314 --> 02:25:49,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, he asked.

1979
02:25:50,375 --> 02:25:51,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I know this shit.

1980
02:25:51,175 --> 02:25:51,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

1981
02:25:52,076 --> 02:25:54,559
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's from Robert M. What?

1982
02:25:56,124 --> 02:25:56,966
[SPEAKER_06]: add it for the emails then?

1983
02:25:57,427 --> 02:26:07,044
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah if you want to get in on the email bag mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com but now's the part of the show where we could rant about lack of emails if we would like CFU's of the week

1984
02:26:21,764 --> 02:26:30,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, I did have one at the beginning of the show, and now for the life of me, I can't remember what it is, so... Fuck you to not remembering.

1985
02:26:32,229 --> 02:26:33,830
[SPEAKER_06]: You know the memory's the first thing you go.

1986
02:26:34,350 --> 02:26:34,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Rob?

1987
02:26:35,611 --> 02:26:35,851
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1988
02:26:39,153 --> 02:26:39,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

1989
02:26:41,374 --> 02:26:46,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Um... Fuck you to Whole Foods for being too damn expensive.

1990
02:26:47,157 --> 02:26:48,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to Sunflower instead.

1991
02:26:48,197 --> 02:26:49,338
[SPEAKER_09]: All the same stuff, and it's cheaper.

1992
02:26:49,878 --> 02:26:52,539
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some big cheese wheels that I really wanted to buy.

1993
02:26:53,239 --> 02:26:54,520
[SPEAKER_08]: They're probably like $300.

1994
02:26:55,660 --> 02:26:56,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I like me my parm.

1995
02:26:59,102 --> 02:27:00,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have a whole lot of FUs.

1996
02:27:00,503 --> 02:27:02,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Things are pretty good otherwise.

1997
02:27:02,864 --> 02:27:05,105
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to weekends not being three days long.

1998
02:27:05,125 --> 02:27:06,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do something a little silly like that.

1999
02:27:07,986 --> 02:27:09,006
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for the FUs of the week.

2000
02:27:10,747 --> 02:27:11,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get back into some news.

2001
02:27:12,128 --> 02:27:12,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

2002
02:27:12,708 --> 02:27:14,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Haha, I'm not able to say that FU.

2003
02:27:16,775 --> 02:27:17,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a 3D weekend this weekend.

2004
02:27:18,256 --> 02:27:26,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, let's talk about some more retarded DRM.

2005
02:27:27,061 --> 02:27:29,602
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm saying that because it's Ubisoft.

2006
02:27:29,682 --> 02:27:37,167
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ubisoft learned their lesson with the always-on DRM that they had with Assassin's Creed and stuff.

2007
02:27:38,067 --> 02:27:43,393
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, they're back with the always-on Assassin's Creed-type DRM for Driver San Francisco.

2008
02:27:44,975 --> 02:27:48,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the PC version will require a permanent internet connection.

2009
02:27:51,802 --> 02:27:55,466
[SPEAKER_08]: No word if that's going to be loosened or not, like it was with Assassin's Creed.

2010
02:27:56,627 --> 02:27:59,029
[SPEAKER_08]: or I believe Prince of Persia was the other game that used that.

2011
02:28:00,670 --> 02:28:06,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the console version has the stupid Uplay Passport now, the one-time use code that will unlock multiplayer access.

2012
02:28:07,275 --> 02:28:08,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ubisoft.

2013
02:28:08,777 --> 02:28:09,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I get to play some multiplayer.

2014
02:28:12,594 --> 02:28:13,534
[SPEAKER_08]: How generous of you.

2015
02:28:13,874 --> 02:28:16,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, FromDust is getting the Ubisoft DRM as well.

2016
02:28:17,075 --> 02:28:18,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Ubisoft.

2017
02:28:19,395 --> 02:28:21,996
[SPEAKER_08]: And that kind of sucks.

2018
02:28:22,996 --> 02:28:34,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Then, to kind of add a little bit of the icing on top of their stupid cake, they have come out and said that, guess what?

2019
02:28:35,039 --> 02:28:37,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Always On DRM is a success!

2020
02:28:37,599 --> 02:28:41,120
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a success in pissing everyone off!

2021
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:41,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

2022
02:28:42,521 --> 02:28:49,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, it says, Ubisoft has seen the clear reduction in piracy of our titles, which required a persistent online connection.

2023
02:28:50,487 --> 02:28:54,531
[SPEAKER_08]: And from that point of view, the requirement is success.

2024
02:28:54,751 --> 02:28:58,233
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because everyone went further underground to get around your DRM.

2025
02:28:58,514 --> 02:29:01,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they really think that people aren't going to find a way around it again?

2026
02:29:01,916 --> 02:29:02,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing.

2027
02:29:02,957 --> 02:29:07,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what exactly is considered success because...

2028
02:29:08,141 --> 02:29:10,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, less people are pirating your game.

2029
02:29:11,084 --> 02:29:11,845
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

2030
02:29:12,726 --> 02:29:22,095
[SPEAKER_08]: The number of people pirating your game before versus the number of people pirating your game now that you say it's reduced, does that actually equal out to more sales?

2031
02:29:22,595 --> 02:29:25,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Because those two numbers are independent of each other.

2032
02:29:26,199 --> 02:29:27,340
[SPEAKER_08]: They have nothing to do with it.

2033
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:31,023
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, whether people are interested in downloading your game or not, you know...

2034
02:29:33,006 --> 02:29:38,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone may not have been interested in downloading Assassin's Creed 2 on PC or Splinter Cell Conviction on PC.

2035
02:29:39,253 --> 02:29:41,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they just didn't want to pirate the game.

2036
02:29:42,237 --> 02:29:44,219
[SPEAKER_08]: You ever think of that?

2037
02:29:45,641 --> 02:29:49,686
[SPEAKER_08]: And not to mention, though, that the previous games, you know...

2038
02:29:51,169 --> 02:29:54,131
[SPEAKER_08]: The DRM was hacked within a few weeks anyways.

2039
02:29:54,731 --> 02:30:03,756
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wouldn't exactly go out and shout at the top of your lungs that it's a great success.

2040
02:30:04,096 --> 02:30:10,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Because all you're really doing is affecting the people that legitimately buy the game and now they want to play it offline or something like that.

2041
02:30:10,839 --> 02:30:14,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Say you take your laptop with you and you want to play it at...

2042
02:30:15,982 --> 02:30:33,985
[SPEAKER_06]: A friend's house or something and you don't have open wifi Or say you're a serviceman overseas serving our country and you want to play a game to relax on your break Can't do it Thanks Ubisoft So Yeah, it's stupid How is that a success?

2043
02:30:34,045 --> 02:30:43,927
[SPEAKER_06]: That's offensive The only people that this hurts is the people who bought the game legitimately That's who this hurts Pirates will still get their game and you're an idiot if you don't think they won't

2044
02:30:45,839 --> 02:30:46,540
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2045
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:09,641
[SPEAKER_08]: So, who's going to win in that?

2046
02:31:10,522 --> 02:31:13,783
[SPEAKER_08]: The pirates, because they don't have your crappy DRM anymore.

2047
02:31:13,943 --> 02:31:14,423
[SPEAKER_06]: What's this about?

2048
02:31:14,443 --> 02:31:15,864
[SPEAKER_06]: They denied the rumored cracks?

2049
02:31:16,084 --> 02:31:18,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this was back in March.

2050
02:31:19,645 --> 02:31:25,068
[SPEAKER_08]: They had, of course, their new DRM, and I want to say it was for... I'm trying to remember which game it was.

2051
02:31:25,108 --> 02:31:30,730
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't... Maybe it was Assassin's Creed 2, but there was another game that they had coming out as well.

2052
02:31:32,010 --> 02:31:32,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they...

2053
02:31:35,327 --> 02:31:43,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Pirated copies of various PC games from Ubisoft are apparently making the rounds online, sparking allegations that the DRM has already been defeated.

2054
02:31:43,470 --> 02:31:56,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Ubisoft spokesman reported to Edge stating, "...this rumor is false, and while the pirated version may seem to be complete at startup, any gamer who downloads and plays the cracked version will find that the version is not complete."

2055
02:31:57,396 --> 02:32:04,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, not completing the fact that you don't get, I don't know what it was that they didn't get access to, but it was something really stupid.

2056
02:32:04,287 --> 02:32:07,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh, you don't get access to our wonderful customer service.

2057
02:32:07,812 --> 02:32:09,295
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get the Uplay features.

2058
02:32:10,717 --> 02:32:11,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray.

2059
02:32:12,281 --> 02:32:12,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

2060
02:32:30,325 --> 02:32:30,725
Woosh!

2061
02:32:31,126 --> 02:32:33,447
[SPEAKER_08]: You've just thrown gasoline on the fire, you dumbass!

2062
02:32:35,008 --> 02:32:35,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2063
02:32:35,928 --> 02:32:42,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of adding fuel to the fire, there's obviously a lot of pissed off people that Mega Man Legends 3 got cancelled.

2064
02:32:42,653 --> 02:32:43,673
[SPEAKER_06]: What does the internet love?

2065
02:32:43,793 --> 02:32:44,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Petitions!

2066
02:32:45,534 --> 02:32:50,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So, an activist group has called themselves 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3.

2067
02:32:52,318 --> 02:33:19,726
[SPEAKER_08]: they're trying to get 100,000 members and they are trying to get them all on their Facebook page so you can go over there and like them if you are so inclined not exactly they are doing that but there's an actual official petition which you have to do is sign up for the dev room stuff for the Mega Man Legends 3 project and you sign up there and then you go to the forums and you make a comment and a thread well it also wouldn't surprise me if people are just trying to reach out however they can

2068
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:23,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's basically that's how they're doing it right now.

2069
02:33:23,683 --> 02:33:33,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I signed up for it and did all that stuff just because, you know, I'd like to play Mega Man Legends 3 and, you know, I'm not going to beg them to release it, but I'll support the movement, I guess.

2070
02:33:34,614 --> 02:33:40,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, right now they're up to 36,428, so they're about a third of the way there, so we'll see what happens.

2071
02:33:41,178 --> 02:33:44,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, no word on what happens when they hit 100,000.

2072
02:33:44,841 --> 02:33:46,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Capcom hasn't said.

2073
02:33:46,082 --> 02:33:49,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Capcom will go, thanks for your support.

2074
02:33:49,565 --> 02:33:54,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom will say, wow, that's 100,000 people that are getting this game still.

2075
02:33:55,748 --> 02:33:56,268
[SPEAKER_06]: DeadRising2 DeadRising2

2076
02:34:20,626 --> 02:34:37,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Tronbon's in there so we love the Mega Man Legends series but there's no Mega Man characters at all so they put in there you know oh there's alternate DLC because Legends never die and neither does like fashion or something like that it's like I know that's literally Capcom giving the finger to that group

2077
02:34:39,858 --> 02:34:43,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I really need to find that quote because it was hilarious.

2078
02:35:02,626 --> 02:35:04,630
[SPEAKER_06]: While you find that, let's go to DarkSakura.

2079
02:35:04,650 --> 02:35:06,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he has some more hilarious stuff for us.

2080
02:35:06,655 --> 02:35:10,222
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, the Skype line is coming up as well as your Twitter topics in just a little bit.

2081
02:35:12,030 --> 02:35:13,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, oh, oh.

2082
02:35:13,431 --> 02:35:21,713
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, it's kind of, I'm, you know how people are always finding little Easter eggs in games much later after the games have been out?

2083
02:35:22,093 --> 02:35:31,956
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, sort of like the blowing on the Famicom speaker to make the pulse voice disappear and all that?

2084
02:35:32,776 --> 02:35:36,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently Bomberman will eat your dust and lick your crack.

2085
02:35:37,595 --> 02:35:40,616
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll break your fucking head with a ratchet!

2086
02:35:41,056 --> 02:35:43,037
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll break your fucking head with a ratchet!

2087
02:35:43,657 --> 02:35:46,038
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll break your fucking head with a ratchet!

2088
02:35:46,619 --> 02:35:48,639
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll break your fucking head with a ratchet!

2089
02:36:01,244 --> 02:36:27,540
[SPEAKER_10]: but it has I'm so fucking proud of you I could just shit you should play that one, that one's great if I can find it I am so fucking proud of you I could just shit eat my dust and lick my crack there's like oh my ass and there's one that says I'll slap you down and shit that's right there tits

2090
02:36:29,390 --> 02:36:31,091
[SPEAKER_10]: The one after that is a little funnier.

2091
02:36:32,351 --> 02:36:33,252
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucked.

2092
02:36:33,692 --> 02:36:35,813
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I mean, there's like multiple sounds.

2093
02:36:36,053 --> 02:36:37,434
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right there, sweet tits.

2094
02:36:37,934 --> 02:36:39,074
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right there, tits.

2095
02:36:39,555 --> 02:36:41,996
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right there, tits.

2096
02:36:42,096 --> 02:36:43,296
[SPEAKER_10]: You talking to me, shitheel?

2097
02:36:45,557 --> 02:36:47,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, this would be a great soundboard for OLR.

2098
02:36:47,818 --> 02:36:50,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Talk to the fist because the face is pissed.

2099
02:36:51,740 --> 02:36:57,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time Loki and I get in an argument about Nintendo, DarkSakura could just say, Would you guys cut out this macho shit and hurry up?

2100
02:36:58,857 --> 02:36:59,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2101
02:37:00,258 --> 02:37:02,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't make me come out there and stomp both of your asses.

2102
02:37:05,240 --> 02:37:07,521
[SPEAKER_10]: I also like my ass is killing me, I need help.

2103
02:37:08,301 --> 02:37:10,122
[SPEAKER_04]: My ass is killing me, I need help.

2104
02:37:10,142 --> 02:37:13,704
[SPEAKER_04]: The one after that's funny too.

2105
02:37:15,505 --> 02:37:17,525
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really funny in like a second grade way.

2106
02:37:17,545 --> 02:37:18,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my ass.

2107
02:37:20,527 --> 02:37:22,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, don't fuck me.

2108
02:37:22,450 --> 02:37:24,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, don't fuck me.

2109
02:37:33,171 --> 02:37:35,513
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna put out Mega Man Legends 3 after all?

2110
02:37:35,813 --> 02:37:37,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no!

2111
02:37:37,154 --> 02:37:37,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck me.

2112
02:37:39,035 --> 02:37:40,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I will tell you something about this, though.

2113
02:37:41,016 --> 02:37:45,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that you could actually go into the sound files in the game and make your own vocal macros for the game.

2114
02:37:45,999 --> 02:37:46,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

2115
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:52,924
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think, I mean, I don't see why this is reported on now, except that, you know, I think it's freaking funny.

2116
02:37:53,684 --> 02:37:55,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop a fucking dirt nap.

2117
02:37:56,766 --> 02:37:58,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds kind of like Bugs Bunny saying that.

2118
02:38:00,007 --> 02:38:03,848
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of funny that they made all these really sick things and they were just never found, you know?

2119
02:38:03,908 --> 02:38:04,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the last one.

2120
02:38:04,748 --> 02:38:05,929
[SPEAKER_10]: You talking to me, shitheel?

2121
02:38:07,249 --> 02:38:08,589
[SPEAKER_00]: You talking to me, shitheel?

2122
02:38:10,930 --> 02:38:12,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no!

2123
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:12,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck me.

2124
02:38:13,070 --> 02:38:15,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll break your fucking head with a ratchet.

2125
02:38:17,332 --> 02:38:18,252
[SPEAKER_10]: That one's great, too.

2126
02:38:21,513 --> 02:38:24,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenicorn chat says, sounds like the Jerky Boys did the audio.

2127
02:38:24,594 --> 02:38:25,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, kind of.

2128
02:38:25,214 --> 02:38:26,294
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what it sounds like.

2129
02:38:27,365 --> 02:38:30,627
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the... Well, you know, another game had unused voice clips.

2130
02:38:30,667 --> 02:38:32,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, I was reading a little bit more about this.

2131
02:38:32,929 --> 02:38:35,351
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a story that kind of has something, you know.

2132
02:38:35,911 --> 02:38:39,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you know in Portal 2, what's his name that did Cave Johnson?

2133
02:38:40,634 --> 02:38:41,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I can never remember his name.

2134
02:38:41,675 --> 02:38:42,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I know who he is, but I can never remember his name.

2135
02:38:43,396 --> 02:38:44,297
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy from Spider-Man.

2136
02:38:44,317 --> 02:38:46,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2137
02:38:46,178 --> 02:38:50,221
[SPEAKER_10]: He refused to do certain lines because it sounded too much like a rape scene.

2138
02:38:50,949 --> 02:38:51,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I read that this week.

2139
02:38:52,291 --> 02:39:02,240
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had posted something about it on my Tumblr, but you can find Ellen's lines, who was the voice of GLaDOS and Carolyn, saying, no, I don't want this.

2140
02:39:03,341 --> 02:39:04,162
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, basically.

2141
02:39:04,662 --> 02:39:08,105
[SPEAKER_10]: But there was one line that I wish they would have recorded because I would have loved to hear it.

2142
02:39:09,146 --> 02:39:13,931
[SPEAKER_10]: It's after she gets put in GLaDOS, says, I'm awake and I'm going to kill you all.

2143
02:39:15,172 --> 02:39:15,312
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

2144
02:39:16,383 --> 02:39:22,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I found that actual, that quote, and it was from the DLC for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition.

2145
02:39:22,888 --> 02:39:30,153
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, all alternate costumes for Guile, Blanka, Dhalsim, Gen, and Feilong are included in this pack.

2146
02:39:30,553 --> 02:39:33,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Show everyone that legends never die and never go out of fashion.

2147
02:39:34,857 --> 02:39:39,480
[SPEAKER_08]: And to which, you know, the 100,000 strongs for bringing back Maybelline Legends 3 go, seriously?

2148
02:39:39,940 --> 02:39:40,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously?

2149
02:39:41,241 --> 02:39:41,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously?

2150
02:39:43,180 --> 02:39:46,562
[SPEAKER_06]: And the chat room is lighting up a minute and a half later because of the buffer.

2151
02:39:46,602 --> 02:39:46,982
[SPEAKER_06]: J.K.

2152
02:39:47,022 --> 02:39:48,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Simmons is who you're trying to think of.

2153
02:39:49,104 --> 02:39:49,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2154
02:39:51,465 --> 02:39:51,725
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2155
02:39:52,246 --> 02:39:53,726
[SPEAKER_06]: And Salacious Pop says he's fucking hot.

2156
02:39:56,748 --> 02:39:57,068
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2157
02:39:58,169 --> 02:39:58,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

2158
02:39:59,050 --> 02:40:05,093
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2159
02:40:05,754 --> 02:40:05,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2160
02:40:06,923 --> 02:40:11,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony soon enough will be saying, show me on the doll where they touched you.

2161
02:40:12,566 --> 02:40:17,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they actually have patented some creepy looking doll thing.

2162
02:40:18,349 --> 02:40:22,771
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if this was the crying baby out of the PlayStation 3 commercials or what.

2163
02:40:23,351 --> 02:40:25,852
[SPEAKER_08]: But apparently the patent was filed back in 2008.

2164
02:40:25,972 --> 02:40:29,994
[SPEAKER_08]: It has only recently been publicized.

2165
02:40:31,335 --> 02:40:35,758
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a plush toy that's packing, I guess, like a wireless receiver.

2166
02:40:36,258 --> 02:40:41,642
[SPEAKER_08]: It means for reading storage medium and even a processor along with both USB and Ethernet ports.

2167
02:40:42,482 --> 02:40:57,052
[SPEAKER_08]: It would act as some sort of buddy for kids who can pop a disc into their PS3 and have the console communicate with it telling it to act surprised, throw its arms up, or at a certain point, you know, at a certain point during gameplay or viewing or whatever.

2168
02:40:58,033 --> 02:40:58,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

2169
02:41:00,541 --> 02:41:03,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Weird and creepy looking.

2170
02:41:04,044 --> 02:41:10,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there a controller like on the Wii for some type of game that was a doll and you put the Wii mode up its butt?

2171
02:41:10,510 --> 02:41:11,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's two games.

2172
02:41:11,811 --> 02:41:12,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

2173
02:41:12,552 --> 02:41:12,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2174
02:41:12,892 --> 02:41:14,213
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what this sounds like, kind of.

2175
02:41:14,233 --> 02:41:15,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Not one game, two games.

2176
02:41:15,674 --> 02:41:15,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my.

2177
02:41:16,435 --> 02:41:19,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, it was funny because I think one evolved into the other.

2178
02:41:19,438 --> 02:41:21,960
[SPEAKER_08]: There was My Baby and Me.

2179
02:41:22,040 --> 02:41:24,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was from 505 Games.

2180
02:41:25,983 --> 02:41:27,124
[SPEAKER_08]: and that came out in Europe.

2181
02:41:27,244 --> 02:41:34,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that came out over here, but we got Babysitting Mama also developed by the same studio that put out My Baby and Me.

2182
02:41:34,988 --> 02:41:37,750
[SPEAKER_10]: But the baby was actually cute and not disturbing looking like that picture.

2183
02:41:38,050 --> 02:41:38,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2184
02:41:38,630 --> 02:41:47,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, to be fair though, it was a holster that you could put on your baby so you could holster the remote that way instead of shoving it up its ass.

2185
02:41:49,356 --> 02:41:50,457
[SPEAKER_08]: This thing is kind of creepy.

2186
02:41:50,597 --> 02:41:53,398
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can see some interesting implementations to that.

2187
02:41:53,738 --> 02:41:55,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Say you jailbreak your PS3.

2188
02:41:55,839 --> 02:41:58,800
[SPEAKER_08]: The PS3 can send a kill signal to the doll.

2189
02:41:59,140 --> 02:41:59,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop.

2190
02:42:00,540 --> 02:42:02,001
[SPEAKER_08]: And they can attack you in your sleep.

2191
02:42:03,161 --> 02:42:04,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Play fun pranks on all your family.

2192
02:42:07,983 --> 02:42:13,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reminded of that one Halloween episode of The Simpsons where it was like, I'm Christy the Clown and I'm going to kill you.

2193
02:42:14,966 --> 02:42:15,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Little dolly.

2194
02:42:19,521 --> 02:42:20,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It is creepy though.

2195
02:42:21,242 --> 02:42:23,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you play a game that involved a doll as a peripheral Loki?

2196
02:42:25,685 --> 02:42:27,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Would it have to be murder dolls or something like that?

2197
02:42:28,106 --> 02:42:28,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2198
02:42:28,666 --> 02:42:29,527
[SPEAKER_06]: It would have to be fun.

2199
02:42:30,802 --> 02:42:33,624
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, one more story for you guys, and then we'll get to the Skype line.

2200
02:42:33,664 --> 02:42:35,165
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about Connectimals.

2201
02:42:36,145 --> 02:42:37,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what was announced?

2202
02:42:37,486 --> 02:42:39,387
[SPEAKER_06]: A sequel of sorts to Connectimals.

2203
02:42:39,407 --> 02:42:45,091
[SPEAKER_06]: You can think of it as Connectimals Plus, or more formally, Connectimals Now With Bears.

2204
02:42:45,491 --> 02:42:46,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that is exactly the name of it.

2205
02:42:46,692 --> 02:42:48,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Connectimals Now With Bears.

2206
02:42:50,194 --> 02:42:50,714
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2207
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:13,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have to throw them onto a trampoline?

2208
02:43:42,133 --> 02:43:42,793
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2209
02:44:12,361 --> 02:44:17,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, you can download the download content for $15 or there will be a new retail release called Connectables.

2210
02:44:17,885 --> 02:44:18,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Now with bears!

2211
02:44:19,807 --> 02:44:20,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Grr.

2212
02:44:21,248 --> 02:44:21,688
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

2213
02:44:21,788 --> 02:44:23,329
[SPEAKER_06]: That does it for the news tonight.

2214
02:44:23,389 --> 02:44:24,550
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go to the Skype line.

2217
02:44:33,557 --> 02:44:35,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Any news stories tonight or what have you.

2218
02:44:35,738 --> 02:44:42,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, let's go to the Twitter and get some tweets to read here in between waiting for some phone calls.

2219
02:44:42,663 --> 02:44:43,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I've got another screen capture.

2220
02:44:43,724 --> 02:44:44,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to put it in the chat room.

2221
02:44:45,105 --> 02:44:46,025
[SPEAKER_06]: God, what'd you find?

2222
02:44:47,607 --> 02:44:48,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I want to know?

2223
02:44:48,307 --> 02:44:50,709
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a couple of bears.

2224
02:44:51,069 --> 02:44:52,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, probably gay bears, right?

2225
02:44:52,870 --> 02:44:53,971
[SPEAKER_10]: They have ears.

2226
02:44:54,872 --> 02:44:56,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Wearing assless chaps.

2227
02:44:57,533 --> 02:44:57,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

2228
02:44:58,594 --> 02:44:59,575
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have cute little ears.

2229
02:45:00,233 --> 02:45:01,074
[SPEAKER_06]: CD Thunder CD Thunder

2230
02:45:29,220 --> 02:45:29,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much.

2231
02:45:29,741 --> 02:45:31,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a couple things I want to discuss.

2232
02:45:31,662 --> 02:45:32,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what?

2233
02:45:34,324 --> 02:45:37,526
[SPEAKER_07]: The two newest games that are out, Duke Nukem Forever and L.A.

2234
02:45:37,546 --> 02:45:37,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Noire.

2235
02:45:38,247 --> 02:45:39,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, what about them?

2236
02:45:40,528 --> 02:45:42,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'd like to start with the Duke Nukem Forever.

2237
02:45:42,810 --> 02:45:43,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Please do.

2238
02:45:45,292 --> 02:45:51,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first off, yeah, I agree with what you're saying, that the graphics aren't really that great.

2239
02:45:53,798 --> 02:45:55,299
[SPEAKER_07]: But Duke still has its...

2240
02:45:58,411 --> 02:46:27,986
[SPEAKER_07]: um sarcasm that's made it that's made the games great over the years and and only in this could and only in this game could you kick a monster's eyeball and consider it a field goal so you kind of like the potty humor in it I mean there's no shame in that potty humor's funny once in a while I do like the wall boobs there you go I mean I but what about what's up with the girls giving him a blowjob in the very beginning because he's Duke and

2241
02:46:29,423 --> 02:46:35,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and they're acting, in the game, they're acting like he's actually playing it, and he's got the controller and everything.

2242
02:46:36,208 --> 02:46:39,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what they're trying to do is, like, imagine this is you.

2243
02:46:40,271 --> 02:46:43,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Hot Chick's giving you a BJ while you're playing this game.

2244
02:46:44,354 --> 02:46:45,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

2245
02:46:45,174 --> 02:46:46,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that awesome?

2246
02:46:46,936 --> 02:46:48,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I actually wouldn't mind that.

2247
02:46:49,297 --> 02:46:49,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

2248
02:46:49,958 --> 02:46:50,438
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

2249
02:46:50,758 --> 02:46:51,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Point made.

2250
02:46:51,319 --> 02:46:52,800
[SPEAKER_06]: That's some pre-order bonus right there.

2251
02:46:57,438 --> 02:46:57,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually like it.

2252
02:46:57,978 --> 02:46:58,059
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

2253
02:47:21,272 --> 02:47:28,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how it's set in the 40s and everything with all the classic cars and everything, but it's not really set.

2254
02:47:29,421 --> 02:47:36,029
[SPEAKER_07]: You can tell it's not a complete 40s game because they usually don't use that language, all the F words and stuff.

2255
02:47:37,530 --> 02:47:40,274
[SPEAKER_07]: But besides that, it looks really fun.

2256
02:47:41,505 --> 02:47:43,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So the F is for fun in this game.

2257
02:47:45,267 --> 02:47:45,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

2258
02:47:45,327 --> 02:47:46,548
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, forget it.

2259
02:47:46,988 --> 02:47:56,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, this game's... The thing is... If you like the toilet humor in Duke Nukem Forever, my understanding is that you get full-on beaver in L.A.

2260
02:47:56,212 --> 02:47:56,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Noire.

2261
02:47:56,693 --> 02:47:59,174
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it might be a dead chick, but still...

2262
02:48:02,029 --> 02:48:15,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how it integrates where you have to interview the person and you have to figure out on your own if they're lying or if they're acting doubtful or if they're flat out telling a lie.

2263
02:48:16,502 --> 02:48:23,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and from what I understand in the game, when you guess correct, or like, you know, you have to guess if they're telling the truth or lying, and then a little chime sounds, right?

2264
02:48:23,706 --> 02:48:24,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's right.

2265
02:48:24,346 --> 02:48:25,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2266
02:48:25,166 --> 02:48:31,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what they should do is they should, instead of, like, just a dumb little chime that should sound, you should get rewarded with more pussy shots.

2267
02:48:32,010 --> 02:48:32,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you think?

2268
02:48:33,451 --> 02:48:34,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2269
02:48:35,091 --> 02:48:39,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you get it wrong, you have to look at that bear picture that DarkSakura just posted.

2270
02:48:39,313 --> 02:48:44,976
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're not, they should just, like, edit it, like, have a little blur there or something, maybe.

2271
02:48:45,336 --> 02:48:45,717
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

2272
02:48:46,477 --> 02:48:55,776
[SPEAKER_06]: there you go alright well anything else on your mind tonight CD Thunder oh let's see what other games are on your radar to play soon

[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go to another call since our phone's ringing off the hook.

2288
02:49:41,014 --> 02:49:41,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2289
02:49:41,914 --> 02:49:42,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2290
02:49:42,975 --> 02:49:44,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, let me turn down my computer.

2291
02:49:44,395 --> 02:49:45,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this is Kai Judo.

2292
02:49:45,256 --> 02:49:46,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Kai Judo, what's on your mind?

2293
02:49:46,820 --> 02:49:48,001
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2294
02:50:06,400 --> 02:50:07,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I remember that.

2295
02:50:07,921 --> 02:50:13,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they had to like fix those dolls because yes, like some girl got their hair caught in it or something, right?

2296
02:50:13,766 --> 02:50:14,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a lot of girls.

2297
02:50:14,907 --> 02:50:22,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the news report had me cracking up because like if you're a fan of horror movies, you know, there's always like some type of instruction on how to kill the monster.

2298
02:50:24,014 --> 02:50:24,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Hilarious.

2299
02:50:25,135 --> 02:50:26,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know what I'm talking about?

2300
02:50:27,077 --> 02:50:32,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so on the news, they actually had instructions on what you would have to do if you caught the Cabbage Patch Doll.

2301
02:50:33,883 --> 02:50:34,464
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

2302
02:50:59,195 --> 02:51:00,116
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the game you want to talk about?

2303
02:51:00,136 --> 02:51:00,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's our turn, huh?

2304
02:51:00,656 --> 02:51:03,338
[SPEAKER_04]: We're the last show of the week, so it's our turn, right?

2305
02:51:03,358 --> 02:51:05,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Yogi, like the bear, or the brand of tea.

2306
02:51:27,119 --> 02:51:30,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it comes from some type of Japanese saying.

2307
02:51:30,664 --> 02:51:33,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It means to read, like it's supposed to read your opponent's mind or something.

2308
02:51:34,549 --> 02:51:35,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It has some kind of mystical...

2309
02:51:36,570 --> 02:51:37,570
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to Google this game.

2310
02:51:37,610 --> 02:51:38,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Google Yomi and the website is Serling Games.

2311
02:52:01,189 --> 02:52:01,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Yomi?

2312
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:17,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Yomi, what?

2313
02:52:17,701 --> 02:52:18,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, not Yogi.

2314
02:52:18,762 --> 02:52:20,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking Yogi Bear.

2315
02:52:20,383 --> 02:52:20,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

2316
02:52:21,004 --> 02:52:21,224
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2317
02:52:21,364 --> 02:52:21,945
[SPEAKER_06]: So Yomi.

2318
02:52:22,065 --> 02:52:22,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2319
02:52:22,925 --> 02:52:24,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

2320
02:52:24,247 --> 02:52:29,411
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy who invented it, he's some type of high-ranking street fighter player.

2321
02:52:29,591 --> 02:52:32,314
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a few of those, whatever the hell you call them.

2322
02:52:32,794 --> 02:52:33,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this looks kind of interesting.

2323
02:52:34,215 --> 02:52:35,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at all the cards.

2324
02:52:35,696 --> 02:52:36,837
[SPEAKER_06]: The artwork looks very nice.

2325
02:52:38,158 --> 02:52:43,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It's surlingames.com apparently sells this.

2326
02:52:43,162 --> 02:52:46,105
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Japanese word for reading and reading the mind of your opponent.

2327
02:52:46,405 --> 02:52:49,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a competitive card game that simulates a battle between two characters.

2328
02:52:49,647 --> 02:52:51,329
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a fighting game, but a card game.

2329
02:52:51,769 --> 02:52:52,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2330
02:52:52,810 --> 02:52:53,651
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great, man.

2331
02:52:53,711 --> 02:52:58,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I like about it best is it's not technically a trading card game.

2332
02:52:58,534 --> 02:53:01,257
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a set amount of cards that you get

2333
02:53:02,157 --> 02:53:02,697
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's it.

2334
02:53:02,818 --> 02:53:04,839
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you don't have to collect any more cards.

2335
02:53:04,899 --> 02:53:09,541
[SPEAKER_04]: There aren't any like rare cards that you have to go out looking for and spending tons of money on.

2336
02:53:10,042 --> 02:53:11,462
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a complete card game.

2337
02:53:11,562 --> 02:53:16,385
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what else is interesting about this is that I noticed every card has traditional card stamps on it.

2338
02:53:16,445 --> 02:53:22,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the dodge card can substitute as a three of hearts and the flame arrow is a jack of spades.

2339
02:53:22,308 --> 02:53:23,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's, that's...

2340
02:53:24,091 --> 02:53:30,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, every character is a deck you can actually use as a deck of playing cards.

2341
02:53:31,219 --> 02:53:34,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes with a complete, I guess, what is it, 52 playing cards in the deck?

2342
02:53:34,983 --> 02:53:35,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2343
02:53:35,884 --> 02:53:38,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's pretty much the game in a nutshell.

2344
02:53:38,307 --> 02:53:38,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2345
02:53:41,930 --> 02:53:45,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a download version that you can, I think it's like $14.95.

2346
02:53:46,053 --> 02:53:50,837
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get that, it's called Print and Play, where I guess you just print it out from your printer.

2347
02:53:51,297 --> 02:53:52,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

2348
02:53:52,658 --> 02:53:59,263
[SPEAKER_04]: You get little card sleeves and you can play it that way, or you can go the super expensive route and get it for like $100 to complete the game.

2349
02:54:00,396 --> 02:54:01,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll take the cheap route.

2350
02:54:02,257 --> 02:54:04,538
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I did the math on this.

2351
02:54:04,558 --> 02:54:07,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to take up all your time, but I did the math on it because it looked pretty expensive.

2352
02:54:08,219 --> 02:54:13,921
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you do the math on it, like if you buy the deck separately, each deck comes with two characters.

2353
02:54:14,081 --> 02:54:18,663
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting like two decks of playing cards, and that's like $24 in change.

2354
02:54:18,703 --> 02:54:22,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you bought them loosely, you'll actually be paying a little bit more than what you would for the full game.

2355
02:54:22,964 --> 02:54:24,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not entirely...

2356
02:54:25,066 --> 02:54:53,116
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what though, 100 bucks doesn't seem so bad when you consider how much I spent on magic back in the day and the website to play it online free, I'll put it in the chat room but you need to try that that I can do, free, I like that word you should have started with that alright, Kaishudo, thanks so much for the call and for the heads up on a new game alright, later I want to do tweets but we keep getting calls and I definitely want to hear what the callers have to say hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio, who's this?

2357
02:54:54,076 --> 02:54:54,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what's on your mind?

2358
02:54:54,857 --> 02:54:55,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Happier thoughts?

2359
02:54:55,437 --> 02:54:55,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games?

2360
02:54:55,758 --> 02:54:56,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Take our mind off of that.

2361
02:55:17,588 --> 02:55:18,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Good lord, video games.

2362
02:55:19,890 --> 02:55:26,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried getting back into some games that I passed over because I wasn't sure how far their reach would be.

2363
02:55:26,697 --> 02:55:39,731
[SPEAKER_03]: But since I've been on YouTube for the past two months almost non-stop, I finally decided to try out both of the Defense of the Ancient Clones, League of Legends, and Heroes of New Earth.

2364
02:55:40,586 --> 02:55:42,408
[SPEAKER_06]: League of Legends, yep, I know those games.

2365
02:55:42,688 --> 02:55:43,268
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think?

2366
02:55:45,390 --> 02:55:47,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it depends on the time of day you're there.

2367
02:55:48,392 --> 02:55:52,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, it seems like these games took off more in Europe than they did here.

2368
02:55:53,376 --> 02:55:56,659
[SPEAKER_03]: So while you're still getting European players, everything's calm.

2369
02:55:56,719 --> 02:56:04,425
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in a newbie room and there are actually newbies playing and if there's more experienced players actually trying to help the people learn.

2370
02:56:04,905 --> 02:56:07,848
[SPEAKER_03]: But the moment the afternoon comes up and all the US comes up

2371
02:56:08,868 --> 02:56:11,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much like, get the hell out you noob left and right.

2372
02:56:11,670 --> 02:56:12,271
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

2373
02:56:12,311 --> 02:56:14,152
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I hate that shit.

2374
02:56:14,192 --> 02:56:16,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish games had a better structure for noobs how to play.

2375
02:56:16,913 --> 02:56:21,776
[SPEAKER_06]: You know one game I randomly played this week I forgot to mention in my top of the week was StarCraft 2.

2376
02:56:22,437 --> 02:56:25,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I just randomly was like, I want to play Star Jeweled again because I love the Star Jeweled add-on.

2377
02:56:25,539 --> 02:56:26,940
[SPEAKER_06]: That made that game ten times better.

2378
02:56:27,480 --> 02:56:31,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of me was like, I should learn how to play real StarCraft and then go online and play.

2379
02:56:31,863 --> 02:56:32,263
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I'm like...

2380
02:56:32,623 --> 02:56:36,605
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm too scared, because there's nobody like me.

2381
02:56:36,725 --> 02:56:39,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody that plays StarCraft Online is already really good.

2382
02:56:39,366 --> 02:56:42,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty much the truth.

2383
02:56:42,987 --> 02:56:50,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried getting back into a game here, and of course I'm still in the Bronze League, but now Bronze League is quite seasoned, so you really have no hope.

2384
02:56:51,210 --> 02:56:52,591
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta play your buddies, and that's it.

2385
02:56:53,496 --> 02:56:54,697
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about the only way to do it.

2386
02:56:55,038 --> 02:56:57,120
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about some of the upcoming Defense of the Ancients?

2387
02:56:57,140 --> 02:57:04,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's a Blizzard DOTA coming to StarCraft 2, speaking of which, and then we have actual DOTA 2 from Valve soon.

2388
02:57:05,226 --> 02:57:06,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not holding my breath.

2389
02:57:06,467 --> 02:57:07,948
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is not going to change at all.

2390
02:57:08,248 --> 02:57:11,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's going to play almost exactly the same.

2391
02:57:12,330 --> 02:57:18,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Even like with Heroes of New Earth and League of Legends, the only thing they really change is the functionality of the game.

2392
02:57:19,014 --> 02:57:21,655
[SPEAKER_03]: And switching from one to the other is painful.

2393
02:57:21,695 --> 02:57:24,777
[SPEAKER_03]: You get set up for the way one game works and it messes you up for the other.

2394
02:57:25,437 --> 02:57:27,319
[SPEAKER_03]: You pretty much got to pick your flavor and stick with it.

2395
02:57:27,619 --> 02:57:29,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So who do you think will walk away victorious at the end of the day?

2396
02:57:29,820 --> 02:57:31,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard, Valve, or one of these other games?

2397
02:57:31,912 --> 02:57:33,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they all drop, to tell you the truth.

2398
02:57:33,661 --> 02:57:34,988
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to work on something more original.

2399
02:57:37,780 --> 02:57:38,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Touche.

2400
02:57:38,381 --> 02:57:42,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I told that to a Blizzard headhunter while I was in school.

2401
02:57:43,325 --> 02:57:44,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I called him out on it.

2402
02:57:44,126 --> 02:57:48,269
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, why does Warcraft 3 play like Warcraft 2 and Starcraft?

2403
02:57:50,171 --> 02:57:52,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, everybody was in there like, ooh.

2404
02:57:52,172 --> 02:57:54,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they sell gazillions.

2405
02:57:54,734 --> 02:57:56,055
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they all play the same.

2406
02:57:56,556 --> 02:57:57,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

2407
02:57:57,697 --> 02:57:58,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's the same damn game.

2408
02:57:59,839 --> 02:58:01,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And I heard he actually wanted to talk to me after the...

2409
02:58:04,142 --> 02:58:11,224
[SPEAKER_03]: after the headhunter briefing he was doing at the school, but I think I already left in disgust, so I didn't get a chance to give it to him directly.

2410
02:58:11,924 --> 02:58:13,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows, I might have missed that on the job.

2411
02:58:15,164 --> 02:58:15,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

2412
02:58:15,845 --> 02:58:16,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, good luck.

2413
02:58:17,125 --> 02:58:20,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope maybe you'll get a second shot with Blizzard at some point.

2414
02:58:20,806 --> 02:58:22,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't mention that all the games are the same.

2415
02:58:24,286 --> 02:58:25,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I got one final thing for you.

2416
02:58:25,827 --> 02:58:32,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anybody seen the Comic-Con coverage for the Star Wars MMO?

2417
02:58:33,721 --> 02:58:35,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Not extensively.

2418
02:58:35,102 --> 02:58:38,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been really watching this carefully.

2419
02:58:38,604 --> 02:58:42,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of just waiting for when the game gets really closer to release.

2420
02:58:42,125 --> 02:58:44,326
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know a lot did come out of Comic-Con.

2421
02:58:45,307 --> 02:58:51,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Based off what I saw, because they showed the first part of an instance adventure.

2422
02:58:52,391 --> 02:58:56,673
[SPEAKER_03]: And any WoWhead that played this game, I don't think you're really going to see any difference.

2423
02:58:57,473 --> 02:59:00,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Based off what I saw in the video, I mean, it's up on YouTube now.

2424
02:59:01,315 --> 02:59:05,597
[SPEAKER_03]: But based off that footage, you still have the same tropes.

2425
02:59:06,238 --> 02:59:10,240
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have the same player classes, the same structure.

2426
02:59:10,400 --> 02:59:11,100
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I heard.

2427
02:59:11,140 --> 02:59:13,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about what Star Wars laid over it.

2428
02:59:13,901 --> 02:59:15,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was really hoping for a little bit more.

2429
02:59:15,562 --> 02:59:16,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Where can I find that video?

2430
02:59:18,164 --> 02:59:19,264
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube.

2431
02:59:19,505 --> 02:59:22,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see if I can dig up the link for you and put it in chat.

2432
02:59:23,167 --> 02:59:24,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Do that for me and I'll check it out here in a minute.

2433
02:59:25,129 --> 02:59:25,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.

2434
02:59:25,489 --> 02:59:26,910
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much all I had.

2435
02:59:27,511 --> 02:59:33,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say wait until you see more footage on the game before you make a decision to do the initial investment.

2436
02:59:33,655 --> 02:59:35,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see how much it is.

2437
02:59:36,077 --> 02:59:38,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely won't get that collector's edition, but you never know.

2438
02:59:38,559 --> 02:59:41,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if they cut the price as fast as they did on Rift.

2439
02:59:41,682 --> 02:59:43,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely have no excuse not to check it out.

2440
02:59:44,192 --> 02:59:47,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but this LucasArts stuff, they're not cutting that price anytime soon.

2441
02:59:47,381 --> 02:59:47,843
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

2442
02:59:48,264 --> 02:59:50,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Xenocore, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can get more calls.

2443
02:59:50,571 --> 02:59:50,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

2444
02:59:51,448 --> 02:59:52,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll dig into that link for you.

2445
02:59:52,509 --> 02:59:52,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

2446
02:59:52,969 --> 02:59:53,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, bye.

2447
03:00:20,867 --> 03:00:25,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Addict 20 killed by deep vein thrombosis.

2448
03:00:25,832 --> 03:00:32,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently a 20-year-old died from a blood clot because he played his Xbox for up to 12 hours at a time.

2449
03:00:32,897 --> 03:00:41,605
[SPEAKER_06]: And his parents, of course, were stunned by it, saying, quote, As a parent, you think playing computer games can't do them any harm because you know what they are doing.

2450
03:00:42,125 --> 03:00:44,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Kids all over the country are playing these games for long periods.

2451
03:00:44,867 --> 03:00:46,529
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't realize it could kill them.

2452
03:00:47,625 --> 03:00:49,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, 12 hours at a time though?

2453
03:00:50,809 --> 03:00:52,871
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just excessive.

2454
03:00:53,552 --> 03:00:55,193
[SPEAKER_06]: That was not a good way to do it.

2455
03:00:55,554 --> 03:00:59,138
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the parents not interfering and saying, hey, you need to slack off.

2456
03:01:00,559 --> 03:01:00,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2457
03:01:01,701 --> 03:01:05,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe your kid was obsessive and you should have put a stop to it.

2458
03:01:06,246 --> 03:01:06,586
[SPEAKER_10]: That too.

2459
03:01:07,727 --> 03:01:08,188
[SPEAKER_06]: There is that.

2460
03:01:09,488 --> 03:01:11,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's see, going on to more tweets.

2461
03:01:11,889 --> 03:01:17,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Ramaditya Knight tweets us saying, Hi OLR, have any of you played Action 52 for the NES?

2462
03:01:17,632 --> 03:01:19,733
[SPEAKER_06]: This is another one of those multi-cart games, isn't it?

2463
03:01:20,273 --> 03:01:21,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I have.

2464
03:01:21,333 --> 03:01:22,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me look it up real quick.

2465
03:01:22,374 --> 03:01:23,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see what this is.

2466
03:01:23,715 --> 03:01:25,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that sound familiar, DarkSakura?

2467
03:01:25,876 --> 03:01:27,356
[SPEAKER_06]: You know a lot of the old school stuff.

2468
03:01:27,916 --> 03:01:29,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I never played multi-carts.

2469
03:01:30,358 --> 03:01:35,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I recognize a lot of the names just from ROM sets, but I haven't really played it.

2470
03:01:35,960 --> 03:01:37,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Why bother playing a multi-cart when you can play the actual game?

2471
03:01:38,135 --> 03:01:39,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I am actually looking at the multi-card.

2472
03:01:39,637 --> 03:01:44,581
[SPEAKER_06]: It did come out in 91 and then it was also out in 93 for Genesis consoles.

2473
03:01:44,641 --> 03:01:47,424
[SPEAKER_06]: They say a lot of the titles had major glitches in it.

2474
03:01:47,824 --> 03:01:50,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get to the next call and we'll talk more about this in a minute.

2475
03:01:50,466 --> 03:01:51,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2476
03:01:51,487 --> 03:01:51,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2477
03:01:53,083 --> 03:01:53,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's Sterlok.

2478
03:01:53,964 --> 03:01:55,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Sterlok, what's up, buddy?

2479
03:01:56,425 --> 03:01:56,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

2480
03:01:57,806 --> 03:02:01,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say well-played Nintendo, well-played.

2481
03:02:02,249 --> 03:02:04,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, I was hoping somebody would call in on this.

2482
03:02:04,450 --> 03:02:06,712
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think about all this Nintendo news this week?

2483
03:02:09,593 --> 03:02:18,079
[SPEAKER_01]: It's both, you can tell, you know, they were desperate because the 3DS hasn't really been selling well because they really should have waited like another year.

2484
03:02:19,321 --> 03:02:20,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least tell the holidays.

2485
03:02:21,021 --> 03:02:21,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2486
03:02:22,582 --> 03:02:30,663
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, the way they did it was just fucking genius because everybody wins.

2487
03:02:31,964 --> 03:02:44,266
[SPEAKER_01]: People who have waited, which is probably a lot of people because people are waiting for your actual games to come out and for a price drop.

2488
03:02:45,986 --> 03:02:48,367
[SPEAKER_01]: And people who have already bought the system

2489
03:02:49,046 --> 03:02:53,207
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting 20 free games and some exclusive stuff.

2490
03:02:54,788 --> 03:02:55,648
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for everybody.

2491
03:02:57,308 --> 03:03:16,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's really good for Nintendo because they've really made sure by doing this that the 3DS is probably going to end up being the number one Christmas gift this year with the price drop.

2492
03:03:17,352 --> 03:03:29,015
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I could see, though, to be fair, as much as I pretty much agree with you on all these points, to be fair, I could see where somebody could still be pissed off at Nintendo because maybe these 20 games, maybe Virtual Console just isn't really interesting to them.

2493
03:03:29,175 --> 03:03:33,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, they already bought them all on the Wii, so they don't really want them on the 3DS.

2494
03:03:33,916 --> 03:03:35,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like, $80?

2495
03:03:36,396 --> 03:03:37,717
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's still a steep cut.

2496
03:03:38,257 --> 03:03:39,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe getting free stuff.

2497
03:03:39,357 --> 03:03:44,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they could have just gone, eh, yeah, we're not going to

2498
03:03:45,210 --> 03:03:46,471
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to throw you a bone.

2499
03:03:46,652 --> 03:03:47,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at Apple.

2500
03:03:48,473 --> 03:03:48,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2501
03:03:49,254 --> 03:03:50,875
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the price of being an early adopter.

2502
03:03:50,915 --> 03:03:54,338
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not even just with the 3DS.

2503
03:03:54,358 --> 03:03:55,639
[SPEAKER_06]: That's with games in general.

2504
03:03:55,739 --> 03:03:59,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Loki just mentioned the price of Duke Nukem Forever dropped already.

2505
03:03:59,522 --> 03:04:01,844
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is maybe two months old.

2506
03:04:02,044 --> 03:04:03,105
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty sad.

2507
03:04:03,125 --> 03:04:04,186
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't get nothing for free.

2508
03:04:04,226 --> 03:04:07,089
[SPEAKER_06]: No free hats for being an early adopter.

2509
03:04:07,229 --> 03:04:08,970
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, this is just the nature of the beast.

2510
03:04:09,331 --> 03:04:09,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2511
03:04:10,452 --> 03:04:11,673
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's...

2512
03:04:14,351 --> 03:04:34,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was brilliant that they put the spin on it that they did because yeah it was a desperate act but it's going to I think it's really going to save them in the long run because you know like eventually like well the like the DS launch was kind of shitty too

2513
03:04:35,148 --> 03:04:37,310
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't have very many good games for a while.

2514
03:04:37,650 --> 03:04:38,231
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

2515
03:04:38,271 --> 03:04:39,251
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at it now.

2516
03:04:39,451 --> 03:04:45,576
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing it had going for most of all was the Mario 64 port that was on it.

2517
03:04:46,277 --> 03:04:49,700
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's the best-selling handheld, like, pretty much ever.

2518
03:04:50,741 --> 03:04:51,781
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very true.

2519
03:04:51,801 --> 03:04:55,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the original Game Boy, but it's doing well.

2520
03:04:56,125 --> 03:04:56,385
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

2521
03:04:56,405 --> 03:04:59,328
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, any other thoughts on your mind tonight before we let you go?

2522
03:05:01,709 --> 03:05:02,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2523
03:05:02,710 --> 03:05:04,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll crack your head with a fucking ratchet.

2524
03:05:05,529 --> 03:05:06,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Gee, thanks.

2525
03:05:07,551 --> 03:05:08,092
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, buddy.

2526
03:05:08,132 --> 03:05:08,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the call.

2527
03:05:09,493 --> 03:05:10,054
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, later.

2528
03:05:10,615 --> 03:05:11,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I still had that soundboard up.

2529
03:05:11,956 --> 03:05:13,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have played something in response to that.

2530
03:05:13,458 --> 03:05:14,759
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on our Tumblr.

2531
03:05:15,640 --> 03:05:17,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I don't have the Tumblr up.

2532
03:05:18,080 --> 03:05:19,420
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's going to do it for the calls tonight.

2533
03:05:19,440 --> 03:05:20,721
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to get through the rest of these tweets.

2534
03:05:20,981 --> 03:05:22,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for calling tonight.

2535
03:05:22,801 --> 03:05:29,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry if you didn't get through, but you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, or you might be able to get a last-minute tweet in real quick.

2536
03:05:29,883 --> 03:05:33,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the suggested retail of Action 52, $200.

2537
03:05:34,584 --> 03:05:38,465
[SPEAKER_06]: But it really was, I guess, like 52 different games that were in it.

2538
03:05:38,505 --> 03:05:40,765
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all different games.

2539
03:05:40,825 --> 03:05:41,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they were all shitty.

2540
03:05:42,946 --> 03:05:45,406
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, one of them, I guess, crashes right when you start it up.

2541
03:05:46,747 --> 03:05:47,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

2542
03:05:48,367 --> 03:05:49,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's see.

2543
03:05:49,668 --> 03:05:52,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Going on to more tweets here at Twitter.com slash OLR.

2544
03:05:53,009 --> 03:05:57,250
[SPEAKER_06]: MNZiba tweets us about, you know, we were talking earlier in the show about WTF Battleship.

2545
03:05:57,671 --> 03:06:01,192
[SPEAKER_06]: She tweeted us the Monopoly parody movie trailer.

2546
03:06:01,212 --> 03:06:03,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I want to play this whole thing, but we can start in the beginning here.

2547
03:06:05,253 --> 03:06:05,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2548
03:06:06,674 --> 03:06:15,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Richie Benjamin never followed in his father's footsteps until one day when all that changed.

2549
03:06:15,817 --> 03:06:17,018
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where your father left you.

2550
03:06:20,856 --> 03:06:21,496
[SPEAKER_08]: A board game?

2551
03:06:29,278 --> 03:06:30,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks a lot, Dad.

2552
03:06:39,160 --> 03:06:41,760
[SPEAKER_06]: He threw all the houses on the ground and then of course the house shook.

2553
03:06:44,581 --> 03:06:46,161
[SPEAKER_00]: In a world where money matters...

2554
03:06:50,677 --> 03:06:51,778
[SPEAKER_08]: You lost, kid?

2555
03:06:51,978 --> 03:06:52,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you?

2556
03:06:57,200 --> 03:07:00,582
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time in his life, Richie is taking a chance.

2557
03:07:02,183 --> 03:07:09,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to teach you all about the game.

2558
03:07:09,367 --> 03:07:10,767
[SPEAKER_00]: And rolling the dice.

2559
03:07:11,408 --> 03:07:12,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's got strippers.

2560
03:07:13,269 --> 03:07:15,230
[SPEAKER_06]: This is already better than the Battleship trailer.

2561
03:07:16,090 --> 03:07:17,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Never fall in love.

2562
03:07:20,089 --> 03:07:21,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's with money.

2563
03:07:21,389 --> 03:07:25,931
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a community chest.

2564
03:07:25,991 --> 03:07:28,972
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love her.

2565
03:07:29,032 --> 03:07:29,732
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.

2566
03:07:30,372 --> 03:07:32,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Love her more than money?

2567
03:07:32,693 --> 03:07:33,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what you think.

2568
03:07:34,493 --> 03:07:36,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now I have the monopoly.

2569
03:07:36,454 --> 03:07:37,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, son, don't you know?

2570
03:07:38,054 --> 03:07:40,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Only I can win this game.

2571
03:07:43,212 --> 03:07:44,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not pass out.

2572
03:07:44,993 --> 03:07:46,814
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't pay the luxury tax.

2573
03:07:47,054 --> 03:07:48,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to jail.

2574
03:07:48,154 --> 03:07:49,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not collect $200.

2575
03:07:49,595 --> 03:07:50,335
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great.

2576
03:07:50,355 --> 03:07:51,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I would see that.

2577
03:08:11,343 --> 03:08:14,925
[SPEAKER_06]: They should screen that at midnight at the shadiest looking theater in town.

2578
03:08:17,047 --> 03:08:18,107
[SPEAKER_06]: After Rocky Horror, of course.

2579
03:08:19,729 --> 03:08:20,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

2580
03:08:22,310 --> 03:08:25,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft tweets us something that somehow we missed in our news feed tonight.

2581
03:08:25,352 --> 03:08:28,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Age got removed from Steam because of DLC issues.

2582
03:08:28,874 --> 03:08:32,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically EA has a lot of sand in their vagina and it basically has to do with Origin.

2583
03:08:33,277 --> 03:08:35,459
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess what they're saying is it has to do with the whole...

2584
03:08:36,299 --> 03:08:41,624
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that whole thing where Steam wants to control the download stuff, but EA really wants that in their own house.

2585
03:08:42,304 --> 03:08:42,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Herpaderp.

2586
03:08:42,945 --> 03:08:43,966
[SPEAKER_06]: EA says, Whatever.

2587
03:08:43,986 --> 03:08:44,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

2588
03:09:04,758 --> 03:09:05,259
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a bummer.

2589
03:09:05,659 --> 03:09:06,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Age is a pretty cool game.

2590
03:09:08,943 --> 03:09:17,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Dartituya is tweeting us saying, WonderCon 2012 moved from San Francisco to Anaheim just for the next year.

2591
03:09:18,293 --> 03:09:19,715
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of a big deal.

2592
03:09:20,316 --> 03:09:21,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that's...

2593
03:09:22,438 --> 03:09:23,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Wondercon New York Comic Con

2594
03:09:43,553 --> 03:09:49,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but they're saying now, there are some updates saying nothing has actually been confirmed about this.

2595
03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:52,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Anaheim is in discussion right now.

2596
03:09:52,824 --> 03:09:53,925
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's don't freak out yet.

2597
03:09:53,945 --> 03:09:55,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe it's don't freak out yet.

2598
03:09:57,729 --> 03:09:58,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2599
03:09:58,470 --> 03:10:02,675
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya is saying, wonder what the holdup was for the worldwide release of La Mulana?

2600
03:10:03,196 --> 03:10:03,957
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Germany!

2601
03:10:05,546 --> 03:10:08,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess La Mulana has been held up for release in Germany.

2602
03:10:08,668 --> 03:10:09,169
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?

2603
03:10:10,310 --> 03:10:10,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to read here.

2604
03:10:12,031 --> 03:10:24,681
[SPEAKER_06]: The ratings board of Germany, the USK, Nigoro, who developed the game, submitted the game for review to the ESRB, the OFLC, and the USK two months ago.

2605
03:10:25,722 --> 03:10:29,945
[SPEAKER_06]: The other two boards have the game ready to go, but the USK has not finished yet.

2606
03:10:30,865 --> 03:10:31,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2607
03:10:32,207 --> 03:10:34,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they can't release it until it gets reviewed.

2608
03:10:34,889 --> 03:10:35,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Joe.

2609
03:10:35,529 --> 03:10:37,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're a big fan of La Mulana.

2610
03:10:37,911 --> 03:10:38,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe soon.

2611
03:10:39,112 --> 03:10:42,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Spazinator giving us an update on the PS3 saga.

2612
03:10:42,555 --> 03:10:45,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent my PS3 in for repairs this past Friday.

2613
03:10:45,637 --> 03:10:47,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I figure that I'm likely to get it back early next week.

2614
03:10:48,419 --> 03:10:48,980
[SPEAKER_06]: We will see.

2615
03:10:50,021 --> 03:10:54,704
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt tweets us saying, The only way to defeat China is to attack their productivity.

2616
03:10:55,085 --> 03:10:56,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming soon to China.

2617
03:10:56,526 --> 03:10:57,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Angry birds.

2618
03:10:59,408 --> 03:10:59,868
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

2619
03:10:59,988 --> 03:11:02,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Angry Birds is coming to China.

2620
03:11:03,350 --> 03:11:06,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess in order to prevent knockoffs and so forth.

2621
03:11:06,312 --> 03:11:06,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2622
03:11:06,973 --> 03:11:11,656
[SPEAKER_06]: It was officially launched in May through a partnership with Chinese mobile games network Downjoy.

2623
03:11:12,576 --> 03:11:17,519
[SPEAKER_06]: But so far there's been all these knockoffs and pirated versions on jailbroken iPhones.

2624
03:11:17,940 --> 03:11:24,124
[SPEAKER_06]: But now Rovio has teamed up with the ad network Madhouse to try and expand the game's presence.

2625
03:11:25,546 --> 03:11:31,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I still say Angry Birds isn't really all that and I don't understand why so many people are so losing their shit over it.

2626
03:11:32,242 --> 03:11:32,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.

2627
03:11:36,913 --> 03:11:38,754
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw sends us a tweet here.

2628
03:11:39,215 --> 03:11:43,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Samsung is going to be manufacturing the PlayStation Vita CPU.

2629
03:11:43,838 --> 03:11:51,843
[SPEAKER_06]: The core processing unit or central processing unit of Samsung's upcoming portable will be, excuse me, by Sony's upcoming portable will be done by Samsung.

2630
03:11:51,863 --> 03:11:53,124
[SPEAKER_06]: These are from Samsung.

2631
03:11:53,184 --> 03:11:55,606
[SPEAKER_06]: These are from online reports out of Japan.

2632
03:11:56,427 --> 03:12:01,670
[SPEAKER_06]: This was on the website of Japanese industry paper, the Semiconductor Industry News.

2633
03:12:02,851 --> 03:12:06,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot of further context besides just that.

2634
03:12:06,134 --> 03:12:06,714
[SPEAKER_06]: But there you go.

2635
03:12:06,754 --> 03:12:11,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Samsung will play a role in the actual development of the Vita.

2636
03:12:12,739 --> 03:12:13,219
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.

2637
03:12:13,960 --> 03:12:14,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Your Twitter topics.

2638
03:12:14,920 --> 03:12:18,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to get in your tweets in the future.

2639
03:12:19,484 --> 03:12:24,908
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, did you hear about the last sales reports on smartphones?

2640
03:12:25,628 --> 03:12:28,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Motorola's dipped way down.

2641
03:12:28,210 --> 03:12:28,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah.

2642
03:12:29,171 --> 03:12:30,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Blackberry's going out.

2643
03:12:30,572 --> 03:12:33,074
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all Androids and iPhones now.

2644
03:12:33,634 --> 03:12:36,376
[SPEAKER_10]: The top three is Apple, Samsung, and Nokia.

2645
03:12:37,216 --> 03:12:37,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2646
03:12:37,577 --> 03:12:39,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think BlackBerrys are still big in the corporate world.

2647
03:12:40,559 --> 03:12:41,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2648
03:12:41,399 --> 03:12:42,320
[SPEAKER_10]: They've gone way down.

2649
03:12:42,780 --> 03:12:44,081
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not in the top three.

2650
03:12:44,841 --> 03:12:45,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2651
03:12:46,232 --> 03:12:46,492
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2652
03:12:47,273 --> 03:12:52,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, before we close out the show tonight, I've got to go to Loki and ask if there's any last-minute stories he wants to tear through.

2653
03:12:54,158 --> 03:12:54,358
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2654
03:12:55,059 --> 03:12:55,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2655
03:12:56,080 --> 03:12:57,681
[SPEAKER_08]: We covered quite a bit of everything.

2656
03:12:57,701 --> 03:12:58,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess so.

2657
03:12:59,582 --> 03:13:00,063
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

2658
03:13:00,903 --> 03:13:01,224
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2659
03:13:01,264 --> 03:13:06,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll work on more last-minute stories for next week, but I guess we've covered everything so far tonight.

2660
03:13:06,608 --> 03:13:11,952
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think we missed a topic, you can always email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and we'll bring it up on next week's show.

2661
03:13:13,033 --> 03:13:16,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys, of course, as always, for downloading our show and supporting Orange Launch Radio.

2662
03:13:16,495 --> 03:13:17,396
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.

2663
03:13:17,756 --> 03:13:19,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, we do the show for free.

2664
03:13:19,718 --> 03:13:20,759
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't play commercials.

2665
03:13:20,939 --> 03:13:23,581
[SPEAKER_06]: All we really ask, help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

2666
03:13:23,641 --> 03:13:25,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Get more butts in our chat room on Sunday night.

2667
03:13:25,943 --> 03:13:27,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell a friend about the show.

2668
03:13:27,784 --> 03:13:30,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you're like, I don't really know who I could tell about Orange Launch Radio.

2669
03:13:30,727 --> 03:13:32,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Help spread the word on websites.

2670
03:13:32,568 --> 03:13:34,450
[SPEAKER_06]: There's people that put signatures on forums.

2671
03:13:35,151 --> 03:13:42,899
[SPEAKER_06]: or just as simple as leaving a five-star review in iTunes really goes a long way because that drives the popularity rankings and helps us get exposure to more people.

2672
03:13:43,620 --> 03:13:51,408
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been some reports on the internet this week that I've seen come up on Google Plus and all that of people linking stories saying, podcasting is dying.

2673
03:13:51,829 --> 03:13:52,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, to that I say...

2674
03:13:54,451 --> 03:14:21,558
[SPEAKER_06]: because maybe corporate podcasting is dying but people like us were never really in it for the money anyways and we were doing this since before podcasting we're not going away anytime soon we're awesome sauce but we can still use every piece of word of mouth we can get and we'll continue to provide this show for your work day and whatever else so there you go but we can't have call it a show until we get around and get everybody's final thoughts so Dark Sakura what's your final thought tonight

2675
03:14:22,650 --> 03:14:23,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're going to miss Pinkberry.

2676
03:14:24,872 --> 03:14:27,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this makes me sad, but we'll do it another time.

2677
03:14:28,234 --> 03:14:28,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe on Tuesday.

2678
03:14:28,855 --> 03:14:30,796
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would like to do a tiny little plug.

2679
03:14:31,756 --> 03:14:31,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.

2680
03:14:32,177 --> 03:14:38,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Look on Geek Life tomorrow, geek-life.com for a special Geeks in History that has to do with Nintendo.

2681
03:14:39,355 --> 03:14:39,615
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2682
03:14:39,895 --> 03:14:41,156
[SPEAKER_06]: A Nintendo geek in history.

2683
03:14:41,417 --> 03:14:41,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2684
03:14:41,857 --> 03:14:42,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

2685
03:14:43,158 --> 03:14:44,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your last minute story tonight.

2686
03:14:44,379 --> 03:14:46,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any last minute stories.

2687
03:14:46,821 --> 03:14:48,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, your final thought tonight.

2688
03:14:49,823 --> 03:14:56,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Fortunately, today is both very sad and kind of happy tomorrow, though.

2689
03:14:57,288 --> 03:15:01,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Sad because it is the two-year anniversary of the twins' death, unfortunately.

2690
03:15:02,572 --> 03:15:04,814
[SPEAKER_08]: We lost two babies two years ago.

2691
03:15:04,834 --> 03:15:05,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2692
03:15:06,255 --> 03:15:09,337
[SPEAKER_08]: However happy news though, Josh's first birthday is tomorrow.

2693
03:15:09,457 --> 03:15:11,238
[SPEAKER_08]: So happy birthday to Josh.

2694
03:15:11,318 --> 03:15:14,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I never realized it was in such close proximity to each other.

2695
03:15:14,099 --> 03:15:16,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, everything is on the 31st of the 1st.

2696
03:15:17,321 --> 03:15:17,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2697
03:15:18,101 --> 03:15:23,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, looking forward to Josh's first birthday.

2698
03:15:23,364 --> 03:15:26,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking forward to seeing pictures of the mess he's going to make.

2699
03:15:26,869 --> 03:15:29,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we've already fed him that kind of stuff.

2700
03:15:29,571 --> 03:15:32,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything like Extifer's nephew in that party?

2701
03:15:32,433 --> 03:15:39,398
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually had professional pictures taken of him and he's eating a cupcake and that was funny.

2702
03:15:39,438 --> 03:15:39,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cute.

2703
03:15:40,138 --> 03:15:47,684
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a picture of my brother Matthew when he was, one, sitting in his high chair with a cake in front of him and half the cake demolished by...

2704
03:15:48,084 --> 03:15:50,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Smash, smash, smash, smash!

2705
03:15:50,446 --> 03:15:52,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a picture like that of me out there somewhere, too.

2706
03:15:52,827 --> 03:15:53,848
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll never see it.

2707
03:15:53,888 --> 03:15:56,950
[SPEAKER_08]: He's having his birthday party next Saturday.

2708
03:15:57,210 --> 03:15:58,951
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a pork-themed party.

2709
03:16:00,692 --> 03:16:00,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

2710
03:16:02,013 --> 03:16:03,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So we all have a little piggy cake then.

2711
03:16:03,634 --> 03:16:05,635
[SPEAKER_06]: We do want the leftovers.

2712
03:16:06,316 --> 03:16:10,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Tomorrow we're taking him to... At least I do, maybe not DarkSakura.

2713
03:16:10,298 --> 03:16:13,240
[SPEAKER_08]: We're taking him to the Galleria to go on the merry-go-round.

2714
03:16:13,660 --> 03:16:14,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fun.

2715
03:16:15,061 --> 03:16:15,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Good time.

2716
03:16:15,361 --> 03:16:16,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe have some ice cream.

2717
03:16:17,530 --> 03:16:33,824
