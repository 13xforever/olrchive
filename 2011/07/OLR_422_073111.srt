00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,200
Tonight, July 31st, 2011, Nintendo slashes the price of the 3DS.

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
The average price of an Xbox Live Arcade title is going up, and could the PlayStation 3 soon

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:32,000
feature a doll?

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,920
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,840
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,680
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,000
first off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hi.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How are you, Miss Summers?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Um, okay.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I feel a little disconnected.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,240
Exterminate, why is that?

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,760
Just a little.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,920
Because you've been playing WoW all week, and you feel disconnected from society?

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
No.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,800
When was the last time you had a Pinkberry?

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
Actually, it's been about a week and a half.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,600
That's why you feel disconnected.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,080
Well, then maybe we should end the show early and go get Pinkberry.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
I'm down with that.

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Last week's show was a fair-a-thon.

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
And that's the show.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
There you go.

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Goodnight everybody!

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
Bye!

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Blah, blah, blah, Nintendo, blah, blah, blah.

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
Ubisoft, goodnight.

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,520
No, just kidding.

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,600
All right, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Hello.

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
How are you doing, Loki?

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
I'm doing great.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,680
Are you feeling connected?

34
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,320
Are you on the grid this week?

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,400
Yeah, I'm on the grid.

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
I am so looking forward to hearing your thoughts on some of tonight's stories, as I know some

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,600
of our listeners are, because we are the show, of course, where every gamer has a voice.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,720
We don't always get to report the news, but we're here to talk about it with you guys

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,600
live in our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and of course, if you've never joined us for

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,160
a live show, it's a totally different experience, I really encourage you to.

41
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:53,240
Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, here at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

42
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,800
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and we do have some folks in our chatroom already

43
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,360
starting there, and let's see, what do we got here?

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,840
SSJ100Matt says, this episode of OLR is brought to you by a higher debt ceiling.

45
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,720
I hope they got all that crap fixed, but I hear it's still a stalemate, but I don't want

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,360
to get too political, because I'll just get angry, because that stuff kind of has a direct

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,120
impact on my life, if that starts affecting the unemployment and all that, like they're

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,480
saying is going to happen.

49
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,360
So let's try to move on to happier topics, like games, that keep us entertained when

50
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,980
these things go wrong in our country.

51
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,920
So DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with, how was your gaming week?

52
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,440
Um, it was, I played WoW all up until the show, I was trying to get that achievement,

53
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,680
the classic dungeon master, whatever.

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,280
You know, achievements weren't around when you first started playing WoW, do you think

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,200
achievements have kind of, clearly they were just ripped right off Xbox Live, but do you

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,000
think they've really added something to the WoW experience?

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well yeah, I think it's, you know, I mean, they don't really give you any, well yeah,

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,400
some of them give you stuff, like you'll get titles for some of them, or you'll get pets

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,400
from some, or mounts from some, those are the ones with incentive.

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,800
Nothing that gives you a distinct advantage, but all the cosmetic stuff, Barbie doll things.

61
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,120
Yeah, but I mean, it's kind of fun, you know, I'll get like a wild hair and say, okay I'm

62
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,440
gonna finish this, and then it'll give me an excuse, because honestly, my favorite character

63
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,800
to play is my 85 mage.

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,080
I love my mage, and so it just gives me an excuse to keep playing her, instead of, oh,

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,400
I can't really do anything right now, so I'll just, I guess, work on this other one instead

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
of making another mage and leveling another mage.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,640
I don't know somebody though who has 8 level 85 druids.

68
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,440
Well anything in the non-MMO universe that you've been up to?

69
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Groovecoaster!

70
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,120
That game is fun, and I blame Shane.

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,240
It's his fault.

72
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,360
And Groovecoaster of course on the iOS, right?

73
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,440
It's iPad and iPhone, right?

74
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Yes, 3GS and iPad.

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm assuming it'll work on the iPod, unlike Google+, apparently.

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,040
Does not work on anything with the iPhone, which is a little silly, but.

77
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,080
And the app really is not that great.

78
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,080
It's more stable than Facebook's app at this point.

79
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,600
But you know I haven't updated Facebook apps since they changed the photos, so I didn't

80
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,400
update to that one because someone warned me.

81
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,520
So I haven't updated my Facebook app in, like, months.

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Nice.

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
And I'm not going to.

84
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,640
I don't know what's going to come of all this little Google+, versus Facebook, especially

85
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,360
when the inevitable games start rolling out, which I believe the early rumors said today,

86
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,380
July 31st was the day they were going to start rolling out, but we haven't seen them yet,

87
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,760
so maybe tomorrow on a Monday.

88
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
Maybe it got pushed back.

89
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Who knows?

90
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,120
It's going to be very interesting when the games roll out, because it's going to make

91
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,440
the two go head-to-head even more.

92
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,480
But right now, I think it's still too early to tell, but I think a little valid competition.

93
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,000
And yeah, clearly everybody wants a piece of the social networking space.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,120
But you know, Facebook, or I should say Google+, has really succeeded at biting at Facebook's

95
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,200
kneecaps in places where MySpace, Orkut, Buzz, even, and other social networks have failed

96
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
to do so.

97
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,720
Just wait until MySpace rolls out their even better game service.

98
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,560
They're coming back, baby.

99
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, you never know.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You never know.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,520
I mean, as things change ownership and things change hands and so forth, you never know.

102
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,960
Don't ever count out somebody who's been gone for a while.

103
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,680
I mean, look at Origin, right?

104
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,840
Origin was an EA brand that kind of disappeared, unfortunately, because they used to make a

105
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,480
lot of great games back in the day.

106
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,800
And then the brand faded.

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,080
Now it's back as a store.

108
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,440
It could be interesting.

109
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,040
Could MySpace come back as a store?

110
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Probably not.

111
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,240
Anyhow, I just want to say, the competition, I think, is a little bit healthy for Facebook.

112
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,920
Well, you know, they do say that festering piles of crap work as fertilizer.

113
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,040
So maybe some weeds might grow out of that.

114
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,160
But no, I've been playing Groove Coaster, which is basically across.

115
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:56,600
It's like, it's kind of like Frequency, where you have the track, but you tap it and hold

116
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:05,260
it, you know, the lines a lot like Oendon or Elite Beat Agents, but the lines keep moving

117
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,960
and they'll sneak up on you and like the track will curve.

118
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,600
And that has a very Vib ribbon type of vibe to it.

119
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,560
It really just made me think of playing Vib ribbon, except, you know, you're just pushing

120
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,800
little, you know, you're tapping along.

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,640
And sometimes it's easy to figure out what the rhythm is, but sometimes it's really freaking

122
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
difficult.

123
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,880
I'm still kind of getting used to it, but it's got the first Arkanoid song, which is

124
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,560
boop, boop, you know, that was pretty fun.

125
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,680
And I actually got a little motion sick off of it.

126
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Wow.

127
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
So I don't know that it'd be able to play it on.

128
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,800
Well, it is very light, seizure-y, you know, fast emotions.

129
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,440
It's on the parts where it starts spiraling downwards, then that's where I get a little

130
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,140
motion sick.

131
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
It's very interesting.

132
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,320
I've been playing a lot of Groove Coaster this week, too, because obviously, you know,

133
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
I love music games.

134
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
It's a dollar.

135
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
No secret.

136
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Yeah.

137
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,360
I think the price might go up soon to three bucks if it hasn't already, but it's been

138
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,320
a dollar that during launch weekend, it's been like an iTunes featured game by Taito,

139
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,520
of course, seeing people that do Space Invaders, clearly the same team that did the last Space

140
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,200
Invaders, not Space Invaders Extreme, but the other one that was on iPhone or iOS, Infinity

141
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Gene.

142
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Thank you.

143
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
It's still a buck.

144
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Nice.

145
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,860
So I definitely, if you're a music game fan at all, you definitely want to check out Space

146
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,720
Invaders, or excuse me, not Space Invaders.

147
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,760
Well, you can check out Space Invaders, too, but a Groove Coaster is only a buck.

148
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,760
And what I love so much about this game, it's the perfect phone game, in my opinion.

149
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,000
It's everything you want out of a phone game, because...

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,240
Except, you cannot sneak into the bathroom at work and play it unless you have your headphones.

151
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,520
Well, yes, there is that.

152
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,600
I suppose there is that.

153
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,120
But the thing about Groove Coaster is that you can play it in short little minute and

154
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,860
a half, three minute boosts.

155
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,760
It's very pretty to watch.

156
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,080
So it's that kind of like audio stimulation, visual stimulation, little diversion for just

157
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
a few minutes.

158
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,880
Or you could sit there and play every song and be diverted for an hour.

159
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
But no trans vibrator mode.

160
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
No, no trans vibrator mode.

161
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,800
But I think in some ways, it's like just, it was designed very well with the phone audience

162
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
in mind.

163
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,920
And I think that's what's great about it.

164
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,840
Because half of playing it is kind of just those visuals of going around the spirals

165
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,080
and, ooh, ah, I'm in a trance for three minutes, wasting my time.

166
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,680
Groove Coaster is a very good word because it really is like this massive galactic roller

167
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
coaster.

168
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,440
And it even shows you the track when you're done.

169
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
So I think that's kind of cool.

170
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Yeah, that's cool.

171
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
See the path you've been on.

172
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,520
Yes, because there's a level later, I won't spoil it, but one of the levels when you see

173
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,040
the path, you're like, it kind of fits the song and you're like, oh, now that's clever.

174
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,560
I didn't realize that was, that's clever.

175
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Yeah.

176
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,920
I really, I really had a good time with it.

177
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,260
Like I said, I've gotten up to the first Arkanoid song, which is like, what, the second stage

178
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,680
or second set of stages or something.

179
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,200
And there's different, you know, I guess musicians that have worked on the tracks for the game.

180
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,760
So it's pretty cool.

181
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,000
And then that's really been about it.

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,920
I mean, I've, I've had a lot of art projects to do this week, so I haven't had too much

183
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,960
of the way of free time.

184
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,600
I've done a lot of going to the gym.

185
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Working it?

186
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Yeah, actually.

187
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Yeah.

188
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
I'm doing cross training now.

189
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,520
Now at some point I'm going to have to loan you one of my connect games.

190
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
Oh, you guys have connect or no?

191
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
I have a connect.

192
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,720
I haven't opened because I haven't had anything I want to play.

193
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,320
Well, you'll have to try one of these fitness games that I was trying out.

194
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
You might be into it.

195
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,720
If you're all about fitness and stuff.

196
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
I really want to try the UFC game.

197
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Oh yeah.

198
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,760
I've heard interesting things about that.

199
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,920
I don't know if I want to train to be an ultimate fighter, but, uh, I don't know.

200
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,440
I mean, sometimes in these arguments, I got to take Jamie out.

201
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,920
You know, I need to smite all those who oppose me with my mighty fist are all right.

202
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,440
Uh, well then if that's it for dark soccer's gaming week, how was your gaming week?

203
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Logie?

204
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Uh, it was actually pretty good.

205
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,920
I played lots of things.

206
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,760
Um, so let's start off with the usual stuff.

207
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,040
Of course played grand theft auto.

208
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,480
Not much more I can say there.

209
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,080
Uh, lots of versus defense force, which has been pretty fun.

210
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,640
Been playing some co-op with my coworker.

211
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,280
And then, um, then we had our company game summit thing.

212
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,280
So some of the publishers brought out things for me to try.

213
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Oh yeah.

214
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,360
You got, you got a little, little, little slice of E3 at your door this week, didn't

215
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
you?

216
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Very small slice of E3.

217
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
All right.

218
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Well, what'd you check out?

219
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Okay.

220
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,920
So I played the newest build of, uh, connect star Wars and there's a couple of things about

221
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
it.

222
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,240
Um, they said that apparently they took, um, development staff off of dance central two

223
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,680
to finish polishing up connect star Wars.

224
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,480
But harmonics makes dance central.

225
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,680
Yeah, but it's still Microsoft.

226
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,220
Oh, Microsoft doesn't own harmonics.

227
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,400
But they still have staff working on that.

228
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Okay.

229
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm a little, that seems a little, it's just, it's, or is it one of those disingenuous things

230
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,960
where we moved some of the marketing staff?

231
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
No, no, no, no.

232
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,760
It has nothing to do with the development staff.

233
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,880
It's the same thing as it's Lucas arts making the game.

234
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Yes.

235
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
I understand that.

236
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Yeah.

237
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Okay.

238
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Okay.

239
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
That's what the rep told me.

240
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
I'm just repeating what I heard.

241
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
A little strange, but all right.

242
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Especially different coasts to Lucas arts is over in the Bay area.

243
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Right.

244
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,720
And then I don't know where their video game development houses, I'm assuming it's North

245
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,640
Bay like the rest of Lucas arts.

246
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,700
But uh, then of course a harmonics is out in Boston.

247
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,440
So I'm saying I don't know.

248
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Okay.

249
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
All right.

250
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Whatever.

251
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
Fair enough.

252
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,920
Um, you know, I'd have assumed it's more than just maybe one development house working on

253
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
it.

254
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Whatever.

255
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Okay.

256
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
So.

257
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Played a bit of connect Star Wars.

258
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,720
They had, of course, you know, at comic con, uh, the new build had pod racing in it.

259
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,560
And um, also they had, you know, the regular, just a little demo thing that you go through.

260
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,840
Uh, yeah.

261
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,840
You know, it's all right, I guess.

262
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,840
But once again, it's just kind of, you could tell how well it's going to be just by looking

263
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,800
at it and the videos and stuff.

264
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,640
And it right for me, it plays okay.

265
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,520
But like the stuff that they want me to do, like for example, in, in the E3 demo, you

266
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:12,920
may remember the guy trying to, um, knock the ship off the side of the whatever and

267
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,320
the walkway and he dropped it and then he, you know, brought it back.

268
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,700
Yes, there's that problem.

269
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,440
But I had a bigger problem because apparently they want you to knock it off the other side.

270
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,480
You can knock it off either side, but they wanted you to knock it off the left side cause

271
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,520
it's a lot easier to do it.

272
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,120
So I ended up not knowing that obviously.

273
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,420
So I moved it to the right trying to get it to fall off the edge of the thing.

274
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,840
So I got it to the point where it's literally sitting on the edge teetering, not quite moving

275
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
off the edge.

276
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,320
And I'm at the point where I'm, why do I have to knock it off the edge?

277
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,880
There's clearly like 20 feet of space next to it that I could run by, you know, since

278
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,840
I'm a Jedi, I think I can be able to manage to, you know, fit my ego through that 20 foot

279
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,320
patch of space there to, um, you know, get where I need to go.

280
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,760
Or I don't know, maybe because since my character can force jump anyways, I could have just

281
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,460
hopped over the goddamn thing instead of knocking off the edge.

282
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,240
But no, the game wants you to knock it over the edge and before you can move on.

283
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,140
So I'm sitting there like pushing at it, like tap, tap, tap, come on, get off the damn edge.

284
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,660
Finally got the tip over and then I moved on.

285
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,180
But um, yeah, the controls are a little bit wonky still.

286
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,240
They're still working it out.

287
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,180
And then pod racing, well, it works about as well as any Kinect based racing game.

288
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,520
And you know, pod, pod racing would be something that I would imagine that would require a

289
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,920
lot of precision, which the Kinect unfortunately just does not deliver.

290
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,940
Let me read this comment from our chat room at chat.orangeonstrader.com.

291
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,680
We have Doing Laundry Man is in chat saying, is Kinect Star Wars gonna be fun after a night

292
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
of binge drinking?

293
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,200
And that's kind of a similar question I have is that, you know, Loki, obviously you're

294
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,040
what we would call a hardcore gamer, you play a lot of Grand Theft Auto IV and, you know,

295
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,700
a lot of these other games that you take very seriously.

296
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,200
Or you may be approaching Kinect Star Wars with too much of the hardcore angles.

297
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,860
It's more something that kids are gonna really eat up and this is gonna be fun at parties

298
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,420
and drunken nights.

299
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,160
It's not like, I mean, it's kind of on rails, sort of.

300
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,880
I mean, you can dash towards things and you can dodge stuff.

301
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,860
But you know, all the gestures are very basic and you know, it's still very early.

302
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,500
I mean, the game right now, it's probably not even in beta and it's, you know, July

303
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,400
and the game's coming out in November.

304
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,280
So there's still plenty of time, you know, to polish it up and it's playable.

305
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
It's not terrible.

306
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,760
I mean, it's just not something I would buy.

307
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,260
But it's all right.

308
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,640
It's just something that like if someone likes The Force Unleashed or something like that,

309
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,100
they're not probably gonna get a lot out of this.

310
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,260
Let's say Josh was 11.

311
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,480
Would you want to buy it then?

312
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,040
He'd probably dig it.

313
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Yeah.

314
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,720
That's where I'm thinking this is going to, is that this is very much for the same audience

315
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,800
that kind of supported the connect to begin with.

316
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
It wasn't really the hardcore.

317
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,840
It was more of the, I don't want to say soccer mom even, but just the family crowd.

318
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,960
And thank God.

319
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,880
One thing that they did get rid of, because it was really stupid in the demo, was the

320
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
lightsaber on!

321
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,040
You know, that was just retarded.

322
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,480
Now you just put your hand out and the lightsaber comes out and that's it.

323
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,320
Maybe you still could say lightsaber on.

324
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Yeah, I wouldn't.

325
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,800
Okay, that would be terrible.

326
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,920
So it was okay.

327
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,720
Pod racing though, I was slamming the walls.

328
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
But you know what?

329
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,640
I blame that probably a little bit on myself because I didn't know how to control a damn

330
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
thing.

331
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:37,760
I went through the tutorial for the single player regular game portion, but the rep just

332
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,400
put me straight into the game for the pod racing and so I guess there's dual throttles

333
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
on that thing.

334
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:51,280
So I was just like, full speed all the time, maybe that's not the greatest thing.

335
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,200
But the game itself though, the pod racing, it's very much like the movie.

336
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
It's kind of cool.

337
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,600
So if they get the controls correct, it might not be that bad.

338
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Do they have Greg Proops doing the announcing during the Star Wars sequence?

339
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,440
Because I'll tell you, a shout out to one of my other favorite podcasts, Smartest Man

340
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,400
in the World with Greg Proops.

341
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,680
He was in Star Wars Episode I narrating the pod races, he was one of the two heads on

342
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
the team.

343
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
I think he is.

344
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Is he really?

345
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
It's the same voices.

346
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
Awesome.

347
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Yes.

348
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,760
So yeah, that'll be cool.

349
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
So it was alright.

350
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:30,200
And then the other game I saw was Skylanders, which is the new Spyro game.

351
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,640
And you know, I was just sitting there with the two Activision reps and one of them, I

352
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,560
mentioned them like, you know, it was like $70.

353
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,640
I mean really, you think people are gonna buy this, you know.

354
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,160
And they think that it's gonna sell well.

355
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,120
I mean it's kind of neat, I guess, for kids because you can just pop this little toy on

356
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,680
there and you know, away you go and you can play as that character.

357
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,120
And they're gonna have, I guess, 30 characters that you can play in the game.

358
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,960
But the thing is that kind of sucks.

359
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,480
You need certain characters to go access certain parts of the game, like you know, if you want

360
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,780
to go underwater you can't use a fire monster, you have to use something else.

361
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,400
So they kind of want you to buy the toys, which are fucking expensive.

362
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,640
They're like $8 each.

363
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,120
And you know, $8 for an action figure, that's not so bad.

364
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
You know, G.I.

365
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,380
Joe's, I used to buy those and that makes sense.

366
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,800
But these are like, they're figurines.

367
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
They don't move.

368
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,120
They don't articulate at all.

369
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,960
They're just not, you know, not, it's just mainly for the game.

370
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,860
It's like physical download content is basically what this is.

371
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,940
So it's an experiment.

372
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,940
I guess it'll be alright.

373
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,640
But I mean, if you're a fan of Spyro and you really want to play a Spyro game, I would

374
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,840
check this out as a demo or something first, because it's...

375
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,000
I was gonna say, I will admit, I kind of got sick of Spyro.

376
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,320
Like Spyro just kind of got oversaturated, but I haven't played a Spyro game in so long

377
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,880
that I think back to like the original one on PlayStation 1, like very fondly.

378
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
This is not like that.

379
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Oh, that's too bad.

380
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,160
I mean, it's like that in the world sense, but it's not, like Spyro looks fucking angry

381
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
in it.

382
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
It's just like he's...

383
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Spyro got more hardcore.

384
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,520
He's like, what the fuck did you do to my games?

385
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
I was so fucking pissed!

386
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,040
You know, he just has this angry look on his face.

387
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,000
They made him like emo-ragey.

388
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,200
They're targeting a new audience.

389
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,400
They're targeting angry people with money.

390
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,320
So it was alright, you know.

391
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,480
I didn't get to play Just Dance 3, because...

392
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh, I bet you're just, you're just torn up about that one.

393
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,720
It was, Just Dance 2 was pretty fun.

394
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,160
I played it, you know.

395
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,600
Just Dance 3 on all the consoles now, or is that just Wii?

396
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,800
She was gonna bring in all the Wii, bring a Wii dev kit, because she had that, but unfortunately

397
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,080
they had issues with syncing controllers or something.

398
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,400
I did get to play Ninja Gaiden 3, and that's fucking amazing.

399
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,320
It's just such a great game.

400
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Really?

401
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,360
Now, you didn't really play the other ones, right?

402
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
No.

403
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,800
So you weren't really ever into this series, right?

404
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
No, not really.

405
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,720
Okay, so you just randomly said, hey, here's a new game, I'll try it, and you're like,

406
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
whoa.

407
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Hell yeah.

408
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
It's just really, really violent.

409
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
Of course.

410
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Of course.

411
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,600
Because every time you, like, slash through somebody and you cut people, like, in half

412
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,040
and stuff, it, like, goes in really close.

413
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,160
Basically, they were saying, you know, that the theme this year was that they wanted to,

414
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,600
uh, I guess, convey the feeling of slicing somebody in half, you know?

415
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Is what they're...

416
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Well!

417
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
What they're trying to go for.

418
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,920
Alright, now I'm bringing up a YouTube here so I can try and see some of this here.

419
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,640
I'm just randomly finding a YouTube channel, hoping there's no narration in the background

420
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
here.

421
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,760
Ah, I don't want to hear this dude narrating.

422
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,080
Let's see if we can find something else a little more.

423
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,200
I don't remember there being alligators.

424
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,480
This could be just some...

425
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,480
This is just a YouTube spam.

426
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,320
YouTube really needs to clean up their crap.

427
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,560
Ninja Gaiden with 100% more alligators.

428
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Clearly.

429
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Clearly.

430
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,480
I don't know if I'm gonna find it.

431
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,240
Uh, okay, well, this one says G4 TV.

432
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,920
We'll see how well this goes.

433
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,840
I really don't want to hear Adam Sessler narrating over this stuff.

434
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,280
And of course there's his timing out.

435
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,800
Well, this segment's going nowhere.

436
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,080
Live Radio Boys and Girls.

437
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
It's awesome.

438
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
I'll just have to take Loki's word for it.

439
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
It's a pretty awesome game.

440
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,920
Granted, though, that the difficulty was ramped way down because it is a demo and they don't

441
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,360
want everybody to fail on it, but there is gonna be, like, I guess, some sort of casual

442
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,000
gaming mode or, like, an easy mode or something you can play, so, um, but, you know, just

443
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
really over the top.

444
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Fun game, though.

445
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So.

446
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Alright.

447
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Was that it?

448
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Uh, yeah.

449
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,640
Oh, did Ninja Gaiden 3 make you want to go back and play the other ones?

450
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,520
Uh, no.

451
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,360
Because Ninja Gaiden's not really a game I would think that I need to play the other

452
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
ones, you know?

453
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,880
Like, if you were to go play Ninja Gaiden 3.

454
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,040
Well, yeah, but if you liked 3, you might as well go back and see what you missed in

455
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
1 and 2.

456
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,500
I mean, 1's, well, obviously there's, obviously there's the old, old, old what?

457
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,360
There's the Atari arcade game and then there were the Nintendo NES games by Tecmo and now,

458
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,560
you know, you had this new trilogy that started, I believe, on Xbox, was, because Ninja Gaiden

459
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,280
was a huge exclusive for the original Xbox, uh, you know, and then, what, Ninja Gaiden

460
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,400
2 was on, I think, 360 and that?

461
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Yeah.

462
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,800
Well, and they also have the PS3 ones, the Sigma series.

463
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Right.

464
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Right.

465
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
So, you could always check that out.

466
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:29,440
Yeah, I mean, it's not, you know, not really something I necessarily need to do, but, uh.

467
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,480
Uh, going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, uh, DoingLaundryMan in our chatroom says,

468
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,680
chopping people in half?

469
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,760
Loki finally gets to live one of his dreams.

470
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Oh!

471
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,240
Oh, speaking, uh, just my, not really the chopping people in half thing, but I, I did

472
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,960
remember there was a few other things, I didn't get to play, but stuff I learned, which is

473
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
kinda cool.

474
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Okay.

475
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,560
Um, Saints Row the Third, I got a little peek at, uh, cause, you know, I fucking love Saints.

476
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,800
I know, you're just, you're just eating that stuff up with a spoon, you are so excited,

477
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,640
you're gonna be there at midnight.

478
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,000
No, a couple things about Saints Row the Third.

479
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,880
One, I, I was looking at their, they had their kinda lineup of, um, their advertising campaign,

480
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,720
so everything they're doing up from now to launch.

481
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,680
And one of the things that's later on, not announced yet, um, is a new mode that they're

482
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,880
gonna have, like, you know, all the other games have, you know, their kind of, uh, horde

483
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,840
mode and stuff like that, well they're gonna have horde mode, as in whores, and basically

484
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,040
when you turn in, you turn on horde mode, random prosti-

485
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Like, w-h-o-r-e-d mode.

486
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Yes.

487
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Horde mode, okay.

488
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,160
Random prostitutes will attack you on the streets.

489
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
It's awesome.

490
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,080
I'm just like, yes!

491
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,320
This game is amazing.

492
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,360
Uh, what game do I wanna play today?

493
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,080
I know, I wanna get attacked by prostitutes, just armies of prostitutes.

494
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,360
Are they yelling things at you?

495
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
You know, like-

496
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't know, but it's gonna be awesome.

497
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,820
So that, that's something they're gonna be talking about.

498
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:09,440
They're gonna have some sort of invite-only, uh, demo thing that my, uh, THQ rep says that

499
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,360
they're gonna try, cause I'm such a huge fan, they're gonna try to get me into, and oh god

500
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,480
if that would happen, I don't know what I would do.

501
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,680
It almost sounds like you took that rep in the back alley and did what you had to do

502
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
to get a sneak peek.

503
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,160
Alright, he'll keep us posted.

504
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,920
Uh, also go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com, uh, let's see, Spyro is in chat right now.

505
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,840
At least somebody named Spyro is in chat saying, I'm probably the biggest Spyro fan here and

506
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,640
I'm glad the game is like the original.

507
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,160
I thought the Legend series brought it down.

508
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:46,580
Uh, and let's see, uh, uh, Spazinator in our chatroom says, agreed, I was just playing

509
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,960
Ninja Gaiden 2 the other day.

510
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,800
The camera needs improvement to put it mildly.

511
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,000
So, there you go.

512
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,240
And Act Defta is hearing you talking about, uh, Saints Row the Third saying, best game

513
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
ever, period.

514
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,920
Hold on guys, the game's not out yet.

515
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,320
What you don't wanna do, do not hype the game beyond your expectations because you'll only

516
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
set yourself up for disappointment.

517
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,880
Um, so, I'm just gonna tell you guys now, Saints Row sucks.

518
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,280
It fucking blows.

519
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,520
That way if it's good, you'll be- Sonic Generations sounds like it's gonna have a lot of fan service

520
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
in it.

521
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,880
Including, I guess, there's, um, different things that you unlock by beating, uh, certain,

522
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,880
uh, challenges in each level, including some of the original games.

523
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,200
You can unlock Sonic 1 in there and some other stuff.

524
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Interesting.

525
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Yeah.

526
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Okay.

527
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,360
Uh, so, let's see, Sonic 1.

528
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,960
How many times has that game been hoarded out in the past, uh, few years?

529
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,160
Let's see, we had the Sonic Mega Genesis Collection.

530
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,320
You could pay 400 Microsoft points and get it that way.

531
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,880
Uh, now it's gonna be an unlockable in another game and that's not counting when we saw it

532
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,400
probably back on the GameCube and every other collection known to man.

533
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,040
I mean, how many times are you gonna pimp out Sonic?

534
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:59,120
And I saw a new trailer for Dead Rising 2, uh, off the record or whatever.

535
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,840
Looks fucking amazing.

536
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,120
So in other words, Dead Rising 2, the way we meant to do it.

537
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,240
It looks hilarious because the last few trailers that I've seen for it, it's just been kind

538
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
of a teaser.

539
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,360
This is just, you know, him wearing, you know, little children's clothing and just doing

540
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,300
all sorts of weird shit.

541
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,880
It's awesome.

542
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,560
I love some of the random comments our chatters make sometimes.

543
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,440
SSG100Matt in our chat room says, I think in the Bizarro world, Bizarro Loki likes playing

544
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:33,440
sports games, MMOs, enjoys eating steamed broccoli, and looking at tasteful porn.

545
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,240
I enjoyed MMOs and tasteful porn.

546
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,240
So fuck steamed broccoli.

547
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,160
Yeah, fuck steamed broccoli, that's disgusting.

548
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,120
Alright, moving on, my gaming week.

549
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,480
Not a whole lot of new stuff.

550
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,760
Again, I've kind of been focusing on many of the games I already have.

551
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,640
I've been playing those, including, of course, WoW.

552
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,960
Been revisiting some old stuff.

553
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,120
I was randomly playing some Super Street Fighter IV this week as well as Wipeout HD, which

554
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,800
I finally looked at the Fury expansion, what, like two years later?

555
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:07,520
You know, well, since in my household there's two of us and we share a Playstation 3, so

556
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,640
I got two of the games, and then Salacious Pop got two other games, so he got the Wipeout

557
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,200
with Fury in it.

558
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
So that.

559
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,360
And I played the Bomberman game because it's free on Playstation Plus right now, and since

560
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,960
I didn't cash in the Playstation Plus until right at the end, I'm still on it.

561
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,400
So Bomberman's free right now, and I played that, and it's...

562
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,800
Bomberman was great, like, in 95, and now it's just, it's something that's better left

563
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
to my memory.

564
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,440
I forgot I signed up for Playstation Plus, ehh.

565
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,840
Yeah, there's some free games.

566
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
I didn't miss anything.

567
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Go get some trophies or something.

568
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,440
Yeah, well it's free game, free until...

569
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,000
Free until the third or whenever it wears out, I know.

570
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,440
So you can check that out.

571
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,320
Also, as far as other games I've been playing that are a little bit newer, I talked about

572
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,880
Bastion last week, I said I'd only played the demo.

573
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,600
I did end up upgrading to the full version, and I'm glad I did, I'm still enjoying Bastion.

574
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,360
Some things that didn't show up in the demo, there's another weapon that I really like,

575
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,680
like a sword weapon that you can throw, that's pretty cool, and you know, I've just been

576
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,080
playing through a few stages of that, and you get some like training levels where you

577
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,680
get upgrades if you can use your weapons effectively, like there's one that is shoot all these little

578
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,740
pods with the least number of arrows possible, and it's just kind of interesting, it's like

579
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,520
half puzzle, half action, kind of neat, and then there was like another one I unlocked

580
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,000
later that was, you know, how fast can you slice everything up with your sword, which

581
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,200
is kind of cool, a little bit of a button mash, but in a fun way.

582
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,280
So yeah, I'm enjoying Bastion, so if you haven't checked that out, and especially if you like

583
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,320
kind of the old school platformers, I love that it's kind of like an old school platformer

584
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,600
with a very new school twist of the way the story is told, so I think it's pretty awesome.

585
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,720
I also checked out From Dust, this is just a demo, so again, these are impressions based

586
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,960
on a demo, I had heard it was like the old game's populace, which I loved that game back

587
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,040
in the day, so I was all about ready to try this, and I checked out the demo and it's

588
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:08,720
very, the way it's presented, the presentation of the game is great, I mean, everything is

589
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,240
very gorgeous, everything is well done, and the way it's put together, it felt like a

590
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,600
disc based game, honestly, I'm really surprised they packed all this into an arcade release,

591
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,840
although I think it was like a gig download, so I mean, and some 360 games are like several

592
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,720
hundred megs, so this is almost as big as a disc game.

593
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,720
I will say where I got frustrated though is that I honestly found the demo, I couldn't

594
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,520
really get past one of the stages in the demo, and I found it really frustrating because

595
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,240
the way I was laying down the sand or something was just not right, I mean, maybe I just need

596
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,760
to approach it again with a clear head, but it was one of those points of early frustration

597
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,480
where I'm like, well shit, if I can't beat the demo, then I ain't wasting my money on

598
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,600
the full game, but I liked where it was going, so I can't really say it reflects on the game

599
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,380
negatively, I think it's just one of those, try this for yourself, because it's something

600
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,080
you have to experience, but it's not really for everybody.

601
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,480
So that's the beautiful thing about Arcade, there's demos of every game, so if you like

602
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,360
those types of games like Populous, I'm trying to think what else, maybe Lemmings-esque,

603
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:16,760
I kind of reminded of that a little bit, you might enjoy this game, so check that out.

604
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,640
That's really otherwise about it, I want to get my classic game on next weekend, I was

605
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,680
talking to Salacious Pop about wanting to hook up the Dreamcast to play the NES emulator

606
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,440
to go play some old games, so I might do some of that this weekend.

607
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,520
I forgot a game I played this week, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.

608
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Oh my gosh.

609
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,200
Wow, old school, where the hell did that come from?

610
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Wasn't that on Sega CD?

611
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
I think there was a version on Sega CD.

612
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,960
I think there was a version on Genesis though.

613
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,520
I played it on my arcade cabinet, it was fun, I don't know, I just wanted to play a beat

614
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:57,320
em up game that wasn't Ninja Turtles or something I'd played before, so Cadillacs and Dinosaurs

615
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,320
it was.

616
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,000
And there's a character in there that looks just like Blanca, except he has a tail and

617
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
weird eyes.

618
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,040
By the way, Rob, didn't we give you a NES?

619
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
You did.

620
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Okay.

621
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
But I don't have a lot of carts.

622
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
I have some.

623
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,560
I was going to say, I'd be more than happy to do some games.

624
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
We'll see, we'll see.

625
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,960
So that you can have the excitement of blowing into the cartridges and then into the machine

626
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
and then swabbing them.

627
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,120
Going to our chatroom at chat.org.com, some comments from our chat, Black Wolf, the man

628
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,280
before us, Sunday nights at all games is in chat saying, Sky, take out the narrator.

629
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,680
Is Bastion still worth it?

630
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,080
Yes.

631
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,000
But keep in mind, you know, every gamer is a little different.

632
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,720
And I really like these isometric platformy type of games.

633
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,600
You know, some of my favorite games going back to the NES, the Super NES era are Solstice

634
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,320
and Equinox and that series.

635
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,160
And this game to me really kind of harkens back to those games.

636
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,840
Certainly the narrator adds a lot of ambience to it and, you know, just makes the storytelling,

637
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,040
I guess it makes it less just pictures on a screen.

638
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,800
And it really does add to the ambience of the game and the story that you're trying

639
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
to get immersed in.

640
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,440
But if you were to take it out, I would still be interested in this game.

641
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Yeah.

642
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,280
I don't think it's the sole motivator, but it just makes a good thing better.

643
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,760
If that makes sense.

644
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,480
If only they had that narrator in Saints Row the Third.

645
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
You never know.

646
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,120
And then he decided to stand there and flip off the prostitute.

647
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,640
Derek H. in the chat says, From Dust is great.

648
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,680
And yeah, I'll admit, I probably didn't give it a fair chance.

649
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,600
You know, it was late last night and I just kind of got fed up and I was like, I'm just

650
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
gonna go back to Street Fighter.

651
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Fuck this.

652
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,080
So I'm going to approach it again a little later on because I refuse to believe that

653
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,720
I wouldn't really get more out of this game considering I really used to like the Sim

654
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,240
City, the Populous, and those types of games back in the day.

655
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,580
And I keep saying Populous because that's the one I am really reminded of.

656
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,240
This really does feel like just an all new version of that game.

657
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,680
So all right, moving on.

658
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,260
That's pretty much it for our gaming weeks.

659
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,700
So let's move on to some housekeeping tonight of which we don't have a whole lot.

660
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,480
We still have every show planned for the month.

661
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,580
I don't think we have any shows planned off.

662
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,540
There might be one at the end of August because I'm going to be gone at the end of August,

663
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,080
but that's that's a ways off.

664
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,720
You are not going on any trips after all.

665
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,560
So we'll be having shows for the foreseeable future for at least the next four weeks.

666
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,760
Oh, nonsense.

667
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,400
That's why that's why you have MMOs.

668
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,880
You're never lonely.

669
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,200
You will not be forever alone.

670
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,540
All right.

671
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,880
If you know what, if you're feeling forever alone, Dark Soccer, you should just hop into

672
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,200
our chat room during the week and say, I can has hug and there's there's people in there

673
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
throughout the week.

674
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
They'll just say hugs.

675
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
There you go.

676
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
OK.

677
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,840
I challenge you to do that twice this week.

678
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,200
OK, we'll see.

679
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,800
All right.

680
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,320
Otherwise, visit our Web site, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

685
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,800
Of course, we are on Facebook as well.

687
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,040
We're on Tumblr now.

688
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,280
I don't think we've been posting a lot there, but it's there.

689
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,800
Orange Lounge Radio dot Tumblr dot com.

690
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Right.

691
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
Is that right?

692
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Orange Lounge Radio?

693
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Yes.

694
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
It's new.

695
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
I don't know.

696
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
I don't know all the stuff now.

697
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
And it's new.

698
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
There you go.

699
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Do we finally delete the Myspace?

700
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
We might have.

701
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,320
I think that's maybe the Myspace is just might be just an archive of old, old, old ass clips

702
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,600
in the to go edition, because that's how long it's been there, you know, like some treasure

703
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
fossil.

704
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
There you go.

705
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
There you go.

706
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,740
It's like a it'll be like something you discover like in from dust, like doing archaeology

707
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,740
and wow.

708
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,740
All right.

709
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,040
Anyhow, let's move on to some gaming news.

710
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:51,160
And I obviously the blogosphere has been blowing up this week with chat on a few topics.

711
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,000
And I know you're all dying to know what Loki thinks of some of this stuff.

712
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,360
I'm dying to know what you guys think of some of this stuff in our chat room.

713
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
Let's get to it.

714
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,160
Loki, we please do the honors of starting us off with the big news this week.

715
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
All right.

716
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,560
So Nintendo hasn't been doing that great with the 3DS.

717
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:13,720
They cut their profits forecast by 82 percent, basically dropping their estimated profit

718
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:21,080
from 20 billion yen or about two hundred and fifty seven million dollars to one hundred

719
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:27,680
and ten billion yen or about one point for one billion, I guess.

720
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,360
Or I'm sorry, I got that all backwards.

721
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:38,600
They dropped it down to two or 20 billion yen from 110 billion yen, which is quite a

722
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
drop.

723
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:45,400
And of course, you know, basing it on the fact that, you know, they they're saying that

724
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:53,680
the stronger than expected yen appreciation and sales performance of the 3DS hardware

725
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,200
and sales outlook for the holiday season.

726
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:04,400
They're going to be dropping the price, of course, of the 3DS on August 12th to one hundred

727
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,960
and seventy dollars from its two hundred and fifty dollar mark right now.

728
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,080
And I guess something similar is going to happen effective August 11th in Japan, dropping

729
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:21,740
the system from twenty five thousand yen to fifteen thousand yen.

730
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:26,560
And of course, there's no price yet in Europe, but I'm sure they're going to get some sort

731
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,760
of drop.

732
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,640
And then, of course, if you're having a little bit of buyers remorse because you bought a

733
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,360
launch system and you're like, what the fuck, you know, eighty dollars now, what am I going

734
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
to do?

735
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,660
Well, Nintendo is actually going to give you some free games.

736
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:49,960
And they said basically anybody that signs into Nintendo's eShop before August 12th will

737
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,500
be signed up automatically to the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador program.

738
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:03,480
And basically you get ten free NES virtual console games on September 1st.

739
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,660
And I guess it's before the release of the games for everybody else and also some Game

740
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,920
Boy Advance games.

741
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,540
Also that's kind of their way of saying, hey, we're going to have an NES virtual console

742
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:19,820
system on the 3DS and also going to offer Game Boy Advance games since this has never

743
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,880
been mentioned prior to this.

744
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,800
And, you know, some of the games that they're giving away, I mean, they're not half bad

745
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
actually.

746
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,060
It's, you know, like The Legend of Zelda, Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, of course they're

747
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,960
seeing some Game Boy Advance games, Yoshi's Island, Super Mario Advance 3, Mario Kart,

748
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:45,520
Metroid Fusion, WarioWare, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, so, you know, quite a few things.

749
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,240
And also, I guess, let's stop there before we get to some of the other stuff because

750
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,620
I want to dissect this a little bit because I've got to admit, when did this all come

751
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,620
down?

752
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,960
Like it was probably Wednesday or so when this was all announced.

753
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,480
And I've got to admit, I was reading, you know, the updates through Twitter and so forth

754
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,760
and through my Google Reader and I was like, what the hell is going on today?

755
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,160
I feel like I've stepped into Bizarro World.

756
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,100
What happened at Nintendo?

757
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:17,180
Like something huge went down there because this is just, does this even feel like the

758
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,480
same Nintendo from just a couple months ago?

759
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,440
It's the screams of desperation.

760
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,240
I mean, and when I told Salacious Pop about it, and I think he put it best, he said, wow,

761
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,800
Nintendo just totally ate shit.

762
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:40,040
And they really did, like, what, I mean, clearly the 3DS not performing up to expectations

763
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,000
and there's been a lot of flack on that, but I honestly didn't see this coming.

764
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,560
I mean, there's so much about this that's just out of character.

765
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,560
A, they didn't announce a price drop today.

766
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,760
They announced a price drop a few weeks from now.

767
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,920
And that's usually not what you want to do because that's kind of suicide to your sales

768
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
right away.

769
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:06,620
But then B, they turn around and announce this program with 20 free games, 20 Nintendo,

770
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:12,440
that is not, Nintuantido, that is not something I would have ever expected out of Nintendo.

771
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,280
But it gives people incentive to buy the game, the system at full price to get the freebies.

772
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
It does.

773
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,000
I don't get that perspective of it, but I still don't get it, like, I still don't get

774
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,280
it being Nintendo because I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

775
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,240
Like I would have expected Nintendo to be like, oh, well, you know, well, we're going

776
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,600
to cut the price and, you know, we're going to give you some free club Nintendo points

777
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,520
or we're going to let you have Mario Brothers 2 early or something.

778
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,240
I was not expecting 20 games.

779
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,640
That is a huge, like, in my opinion is a huge admission of something on Nintendo.

780
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,680
Like we didn't just fuck up.

781
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,160
We fucked up big.

782
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,160
That's what's surprising about it to me is that to be honest, to be fair, I realize that

783
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,300
if I buy something early, like a 3DS, it's very likely to get a price cut in the future.

784
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,440
If they had announced a price drop and they said, oh, you only get a Mario game, I would

785
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,560
have been like, okay, well, you know, that's the price you pay for getting shit early.

786
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,080
Loki imported a 3DS and paid a premium to have it like a couple weeks early.

787
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,420
That's just what we do sometimes because we're sick.

788
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,320
We want to have the newest gadgets early.

789
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,280
I would have been perfectly fine with it, but now to hear there's like 20 free games

790
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,280
coming out.

791
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,960
Now I'm not just like, oh, I'm not unhappy about this price drop.

792
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,320
Now I'm like, fuck, I'm really glad I bought one early.

793
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,840
I mean, look at the games they're talking about on the Game Boy Advance, Metroid, Yoshi's

794
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Island.

795
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,000
Metroid Fusion's fucking awesome.

796
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,520
They're not, there might be like half and half, half crap, half, but no, half triple

797
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,520
A titles.

798
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,080
I do have a point though to make.

799
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
What?

800
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,880
We're glad that we didn't get one because first of all, all of those games that are

801
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,520
worth having, I already own.

802
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,520
I bought them on my old system.

803
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,960
Second, we're not going to spend as much money.

804
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Okay.

805
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,840
But hold that thought because Loki, you got to read this next bit then on this.

806
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,520
I know you're dying to give your impressions to, Loki, but I'm going to make the listeners

807
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
wait a minute.

808
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,720
So Loki, read this next story because here's, here's where things get real fucking interesting

809
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
real quick.

810
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,040
Uh, 3DS NES games will also include multiplayer following an update.

811
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:25,000
Yes, you'll be able to play those, um, virtual console games, um, I guess with other people

812
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
now.

813
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,200
I'm not sure if that's over the internet or if that's just locally, but that's kind

814
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
of interesting.

815
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,800
Um, and here's the list of NES games that they've announced.

816
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,880
Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong Jr, Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, and The Legend of Zelda,

817
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,320
and then of course five other unknown games right now.

818
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:50,120
So, they added multiplayer into virtual console and we don't know yet, but this possibly could

819
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,200
be over the internet.

820
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,320
They're doing what they should have done with the Wii five years ago?

821
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,320
Finally?

822
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:03,500
I mean, that makes these games a lot more, I mean, because let's face it, Nintendo is

823
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,280
kind of sucker punching us a little bit here.

824
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,640
If you didn't early adopt the 3DS and you do want to get these games and let's say they

825
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,000
do end up being multiplayer over the internet, you're going to have to buy them again.

826
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,080
Even if you bought them for five bucks the first time on the Wii, you're going to have

827
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,580
to buy them again.

828
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,560
But for the early adopters, now you're kind of in this, well, I can't really get mad cause

829
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,040
I'm still going to get it for free.

830
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,080
But Dark Sakura, let's say the multiplayer thing pans out.

831
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,720
Let's say it ends up that you can play it on the internet.

832
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,000
Now does that change your opinion or are you still like, no, at the end of the day I say

833
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm saving 80 bucks.

834
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,060
I don't care about multiplayer.

835
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,640
I really don't.

836
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,640
So that's just, okay, good.

837
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,960
I'm glad for other people, but I don't care.

838
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
That's me.

839
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
Fair enough.

840
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,960
Fair enough.

841
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,960
Keep in mind how few times I've done any multiplayer game on Xbox live or I think the last multiplayer

842
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:57,400
game I've played that involved a Nintendo system was playing Super Mario Brothers.

843
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,760
And then that I didn't really like it with the multiplayer aspect.

844
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,200
So cause I was just like, stop being stupid.

845
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Just let me play by myself.

846
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,880
You know, I was just getting annoyed.

847
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,140
So I do not play well with others.

848
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:16,680
Now I want to emphasize, we don't know for sure yet if multiplayer means multiplayer

849
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,200
on the internet.

850
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,080
We're all forming a prayer circle right now that for those of us that are in a multiplayer,

851
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,780
we're all forming a prayer circle that Nintendo is going to do the right thing and they are

852
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,440
going to open up the internet because if the emulation scene's been able to do it for years,

853
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,160
there's no reason Nintendo cannot open these games to play on the internet.

854
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:36,200
However, we should only expect that multiplayer means within the same room, which is still

855
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,160
interesting, I guess.

856
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,880
I don't know if I would repay $5 for these games for that alone, but if Nintendo is going

857
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,280
to hand them to me for free, I'm not exactly going to bash them.

858
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
You know what I mean?

859
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,040
And then here's another interesting thing.

860
00:42:53,040 --> 00:43:02,560
Apparently, Satori Iwata, he's gone ahead and taken a 50% reduction in pay as a result

861
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,920
of the 3DS's slow sales.

862
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
What?

863
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,320
Who are you people?

864
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,920
Nintendo, I don't even know you anymore.

865
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,640
You're taking pay cuts now?

866
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:22,600
Other representative directors, including senior managing directors Miyamoto and Shinji

867
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:30,520
Hatano, are taking a 30% pay cut and other executives will lose 20% off their salaries.

868
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,200
I bet you anything that will not happen to Nintendo US.

869
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,320
I think they said Reggie's one of the affected people, right?

870
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
Uh, no.

871
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,320
Oh, interesting.

872
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,120
I didn't pick up on that.

873
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,800
Doing something like that is, honestly, it's...

874
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,380
It is the corporate equivalent of falling on your sword.

875
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,000
It's very much a Japanese thing.

876
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,140
Oh yeah.

877
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:55,880
To take responsibility, you know, for the sake of the whole company.

878
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,320
If only Congress would do that.

879
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,320
I know, right?

880
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,320
But I mean...

881
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:05,360
So now, in the scope of a week, we've gone from kicking Nintendo, fuck you Nintendo,

882
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,920
Operation Rainfall for life, fuck you, I hate you, to, oh my god, Congress needs to look

883
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,800
at what Nintendo's doing.

884
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,440
This all happened in a week!

885
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,680
I know.

886
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,400
Honestly, every politician needs to take a look at what Nintendo's doing.

887
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,240
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

888
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:30,200
Before we start talking about what Congress needs to start emulating from Nintendo, we're

889
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:36,040
still not over the fact that they botched all this stuff up with the Wii and all the

890
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,240
online and not bringing games over and whatnot.

891
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,880
But this is a very effective diversion.

892
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,920
Let me put it this way, okay?

893
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:52,480
Sony, they made a multi-million dollar error, if you will, in their online security, and

894
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,720
I got two games for it.

895
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,760
Nintendo, to make up for dropping- You got four games, you know you work the system,

896
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,480
just like the rest of us did with the multi-accounts.

897
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,800
To be fair, you got two PS3 games, two PSP games-

898
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,840
I did not actually do it on my other- Alright, well, whatever, it doesn't matter.

899
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:17,120
Um, and then, you know, we get- Okay, four games, fine.

900
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,560
Whereas Nintendo, oh, we're making up for dropping the console price.

901
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,620
Something that, you know, we knew was gonna happen, granted, it's a little bit earlier

902
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:25,620
than expected.

903
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,620
Who cares?

904
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,120
You know, if you've already bought it, whatever.

905
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,400
Um, so, you know, they're gonna give me twenty dollars, or twenty free games.

906
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,660
Now here's the best part, if you really want to game the system, here's what you do.

907
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:45,520
You go to, you know, a Best Buy, or a Walmart, or something like that, just before August

908
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,520
12th.

909
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,440
You buy a system for the full price, you log it onto Nintendo's network, and then when

910
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,480
it drops the price two days later, you come in and go, what the hell?

911
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,560
Why this drop in price?

912
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,480
I want a, you know, refund.

913
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,260
And they will refund you the difference in price.

914
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,240
If these companies are smart, which I'm not saying they are, but if they're smart, they're

915
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,920
gonna put an exemption to their policy, like just a couple weeks before.

916
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,920
Watch.

917
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,800
At least one of these stores is gonna do that.

918
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,680
They're gonna say, 3DS accepted from the policy from X to Y day.

919
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,760
They're gonna wait till right that first day that the refund, you know, if it's like a

920
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,320
twenty one day window, they'll wait till, well I guess we would be in that window, but,

921
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,320
you know, I don't know what the windows are, depending on what store you shop at, but I

922
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,960
bet some of them are gonna throw up an exception.

923
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,680
Maybe not something as huge as Walmart, but I bet you some of these other stores will.

924
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,160
You'll probably get, well at the very least, you know, if those games are interesting to

925
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,200
you, I mean, you can give it a shot.

926
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,160
I mean, I think that most of the time, if you're gonna, you know, you just play ignorant,

927
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,000
I guess, and, you know, cause not everybody's up reading gaming news and stuff like that.

928
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,040
You know, the moms and stuff like that, they aren't reading that, but then they hear about

929
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,800
an eighty dollar price drop, and they're like, what the hell?

930
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,440
I just spent the money.

931
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,000
Of course, you know.

932
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,320
Of course, we know that, but.

933
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:08,880
So Loki, you, okay, Loki, sometimes your thoughts on Nintendo really confuse the hell out of

934
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:15,600
me because you imported a 3DS from Japan just so you could have it before anybody else,

935
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,200
and you know, you were an early adopter of Nintendo, and I know you were an early adopter

936
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,440
of Wii as well, but then Nintendo does things that really piss you off, and you've screamed

937
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,000
and you've yelled at them here on the show, so surely you must have seen the news this

938
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,720
week and gone, what is this?

939
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,720
What is going on?

940
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,440
What is your reaction to all the news this week, and where are you at now?

941
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,080
My reaction is like, wow, I'm surprised they're dropping it this early.

942
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,680
I'm like, I guess that's an admission that, you know, it's not selling well, which we

943
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,760
all knew, and then, you know, wasn't angry about it.

944
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,680
You know, the only thing about these twenty free games is that, you know, it's kind of

945
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,680
cool.

946
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,480
At least I'll have something that I can put on my memory card that I can play, cause I'm

947
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,360
not, I'm not fucking buying any of those virtual console games.

948
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,500
I'm not paying money for that kind of stuff, hell no.

949
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,720
So that's kind of cool that I'll have something to fill up my memory card with, but at the

950
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,000
same time, you know, dropping the price of the system doesn't make any of the good games

951
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,200
come out any sooner, I mean, cause, you know, what, they announced a couple games, you know,

952
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,520
out this year, a new Mario, a Mario Kart, and stuff like that, but, I mean, I've seen

953
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,880
the videos of Mario Kart, and I was just kind of, eh, they added hang gliders and underwater,

954
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,560
big fucking deal.

955
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,280
You know, it's not that exciting, so, you know, I, it, I'll have something to download

956
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,040
for free, but it's not gonna definitely, not gonna get me to buy more things, and it's

957
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,680
definitely not gonna get me to buy crappy games that are out there now.

958
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:46,640
So, I mean, I would just have, I'm glad I'll have it used to dust off my system, cause

959
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,240
I was looking at it as sitting on the coffee table, not being charged or anything, just

960
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,360
sitting there, I'm like, eh, well, I don't know.

961
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,280
Uh, go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrady.com, technist in our chatroom says, right, Nintendo

962
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,640
running America, that means they will just rehash the same laws and not make new ones.

963
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,600
Isn't that kind of what's happening now, like, nobody wants to do something different, that's,

964
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,240
that's where we're at right now, but anyway, sorry, didn't mean to, uh, get controversial.

965
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,560
So this is Pop in our chat, says, what I want to know is, will DSi XL get a price drop too

966
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,560
now?

967
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:20,320
Very interesting that that is completely absent, but I would think logically it has to, right,

968
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,560
cause isn't the DSi XL right now, $179?

969
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,560
I don't remember.

970
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,880
I thought they already dropped the price of that stuff, I know they did the regular DS.

971
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:33,940
But even, I mean, logically, if the 3DS is coming down that low, XL and the rest of them,

972
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,000
if they're not fading into obscurity altogether, are going to have to get some type of price

973
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,640
cut, like XL ought to come down to 129, if not less, but I don't know, there's also a

974
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,720
part of me that kind of thinks like, well, why wouldn't Nintendo just get rid of all

975
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,760
the old DSs altogether and say, buy a 3DS or get GTFO?

976
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,040
I mean, and could you really blame them for doing that?

977
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,040
I mean, you would still have the current inventory on shelves now, we'll get their prices slashed

978
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,220
to get it off the shelves and make room for more 3DSs, but, well, let's talk about the

979
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:11,160
other topic that kind of comes up with this story and that is how does the Vita play into

980
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,160
all of this?

981
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,480
Because obviously a lot of folks, when they heard that the price point of the Vita was

982
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,080
going to be $250 for the lowest model was like, uh oh, Nintendo's in trouble.

983
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:27,600
So a lot of people see what's going on right now as a direct response, not just to Nintendo's

984
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,120
not doing so hot right now with the 3DS, but the Vita is going to be the same price and

985
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,160
Nintendo foresees trouble if they don't do this now.

986
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,760
I think it's a good idea that they did it because of the Vita and also because right

987
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,720
now the Vita's launch lineup is looking about as good as Nintendo's 3DS launch lineup.

988
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,640
Thank you, that's where I'm coming from.

989
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,400
There's these, you know, and I'm reading things on the internet that are like, oh, Sony was

990
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,000
just, Sony was ready to give Nintendo rumble and stuff, and like, I'm not trying to hate

991
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,960
on the Vita, but I also don't see where it's in much better of a position right now.

992
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,240
All the announced titles that they've got coming out right now aren't that exciting.

993
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,240
Uncharted.

994
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,960
That's their one big, huge thing they got.

995
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,480
Yeah, the other ones, like, I couldn't give a crap about whatever the hell that game,

996
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,080
the puzzle game is where they're like really showing off the back touch stuff or, you know,

997
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:21,200
I don't need another fucking rehash of goddamn, you know, uh, was it, uh, well, Little Big

998
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,200
Planet for one.

999
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:27,840
I mean, yeah, great, you know, Little Big Planet's coming out, but it's just like, okay,

1000
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,840
it's gonna do a few different things.

1001
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,280
I just don't care.

1002
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,560
Or their kart racing game, which for the life of me I can't remember the fuck it's called

1003
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,680
right now, but I don't care.

1004
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,640
Ooh, I can make mountains by putting my fingers in their, I don't care.

1005
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,440
I just don't care.

1006
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:50,280
So I don't know, it's, I just think, you know, and don't get me wrong.

1007
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,280
I want a Vita.

1008
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,680
I'm going to buy a Vita at launch.

1009
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
I will.

1010
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,800
I mean, I just, I, I'm a techno, techno person.

1011
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,120
I have to have it all, but, uh, and there, there are a couple of games on Vita.

1012
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,720
I do want, there was that one music game that Miklotov was talking about on one of the E3

1013
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,720
specials that I want to get.

1014
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,600
And then there's that dungeon game that there, that probably won't be out at launch, but

1015
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,520
I know down the road, I'll want to get that.

1016
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:15,120
Um, so there are things on Vita that I want, but I look at the holidays and I go, I still

1017
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,640
think Nintendo is going to win.

1018
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,520
I don't think the Vita is going to win the holidays.

1019
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,920
I got Mario.

1020
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,100
I know 3DS has the Mario games coming out.

1021
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,360
Do not underestimate the power of the soccer mom.

1022
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,380
What won Christmas five years ago?

1023
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,400
The Wii.

1024
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,080
What won Christmas last year?

1025
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,080
The Kinect.

1026
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,200
Who is the target audience of both of those?

1027
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,580
Oprah watchers.

1028
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,920
You know, it's, I think it's going to be the same story this year.

1029
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,960
The performance from March to now isn't really going to matter when it comes to the holidays

1030
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,640
and all the kids everywhere want the 3DS to play Mario and watch 3D movies on.

1031
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,320
I mean, the 3DS kind of has a lot going for it.

1032
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,320
And I got to think also that some people, well, a lot of people probably thought, Hey,

1033
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,320
you know what?

1034
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:02,480
Nintendo is probably going to drop the price of the 3DS before holiday because you know,

1035
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,280
it's not doing that well.

1036
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,440
Or I mean, even if it was doing all right, they still want to, you know, incentivize

1037
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,000
people for, you know, buying the system.

1038
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,680
I mean, I think a lot of people are like, well, you know what?

1039
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,280
There's not a lot of good games out right now.

1040
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,000
I'm just going to wait.

1041
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And waiting paid off for you.

1042
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,320
I'm just saying, imagine you're a soccer mom.

1043
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,440
Now, I know, I know.

1044
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
Just hear me out here for a minute.

1045
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,760
Imagine you're a soccer mom and you don't know anything about games, but you know, there's

1046
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,760
this one system that's $250 that I guess does some type of back touch thing.

1047
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:40,400
But then there's this other system over here that's $80 less and it does 3D Mario and it

1048
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,400
has Mario on it.

1049
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
Yeah.

1050
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,760
Would you remember some of your friends liking when you were in junior high school?

1051
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,720
Which is where the soccer moms are at now.

1052
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,720
Right?

1053
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,720
Yeah.

1054
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,000
So I mean, like, when I'm not trying to, again, I'm not trying to knock the Vita.

1055
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,360
I think it's going to be huge with the college crowd and the young twenties and you know,

1056
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,320
more adult gamers, if you will, it'll still be huge with them.

1057
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,960
And the fact that it's a, you know, all in one in the pocket.

1058
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,960
But I think when it comes down to the actual sales, I think what shows up under those Christmas

1059
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,480
trees and Hanukkah menorahs and so forth are going to be 3DSs.

1060
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,440
Do you put your presence under the menorah?

1061
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,800
We don't really do presence for Hanukkah.

1062
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,000
I thought you were supposed to have eight crazy nights.

1063
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,720
The whole presence thing started because of Christmas actually.

1064
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,640
Cause little kids that my friends, my Gentile friends get presents.

1065
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,840
I want presents too.

1066
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,200
Usually it's like the back to school holiday.

1067
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,600
You get pencils and paper.

1068
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,520
So I don't have to get you a present heathen.

1069
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,520
You can get me a present.

1070
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,840
I get you a present.

1071
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,160
I get you guys presents because I know that you celebrate Christmas.

1072
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,980
Well, you know, I like presents because I'm greedy.

1073
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,980
There you go.

1074
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:49,980
And special.

1075
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,980
There you go.

1076
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:55,920
Uh, going to our chat room, uh, laha in the chat room says, I think the parents didn't

1077
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,280
like the 3D.

1078
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,000
Something about not wanting to mess up their kids' eyes.

1079
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,440
Uh, but what about, okay, look at movies, dude, Smurfs 3D is like a top as a box office.

1080
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,280
3D really bugs my eyes.

1081
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,880
You know, I hate looking at the world in 3D.

1082
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,080
It really hurts my eyes.

1083
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,080
Actually I will tell you something.

1084
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,920
I know what laha is referring to.

1085
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,200
It's those studies about the kids' eyes and so forth, but honestly the 3DS itself is not

1086
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,200
true 3D.

1087
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,680
It's lenticular and that can cause some issues with, with vision.

1088
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,280
I mean, it gives me a headache.

1089
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,680
I can't play a 3DS for very long without getting a headache.

1090
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,400
So the first day it gave me a headache, but now it's fine.

1091
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,520
Ridge Racer was unplayable.

1092
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,660
It was just completely unplayable.

1093
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:41,800
I've actually been using the 3DS a little bit as a Netflix device.

1094
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,800
Like it's kind of nice to just have it like, you know, when you're like lying in bed, but

1095
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,260
you're not really ready to go to sleep.

1096
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,000
Like it's kind of nice to just be able to, you know, have the thing there to watch Netflix.

1097
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Yeah.

1098
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,400
And funny enough, I have an iPhone, which I could use, but I don't know, usually that's

1099
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,400
on the charger.

1100
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,280
But the 3DS just kind of works.

1101
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,280
Yeah.

1102
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,720
You know, I guess they do have a point with the 3D thing.

1103
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,360
I mean, that's really gonna torpedo their sales.

1104
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,960
If only they had the forethought to, you know, put in a slider or something to turn the 3D

1105
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,960
off.

1106
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,960
If only.

1107
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,200
Sorry Nintendo, maybe next time.

1108
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,320
All right.

1109
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,680
And Tigerclaw and Chad is correcting me saying Smurfs and Cowboy and Aliens are sharing the

1110
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,600
number one spot this week.

1111
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,040
But the reason why the Smurfs is even tied in the first place is that it's, it's has

1112
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,560
those extra 3D ticket sales because let's face it, no one over the age of 11 wanted

1113
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,080
to see the Smurfs movie.

1114
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,020
I still want to see Cowboys and Aliens.

1115
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:40,520
I'm very torn about the Smurfs movie because I really like Neil Patrick Harris, but I really

1116
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,520
hate everything else about that movie.

1117
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:48,360
I love Hank Azaria and he's Gargamel, but I am not fucking sitting through that movie.

1118
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,360
I'm sorry.

1119
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,620
He does, however, look just like freaking Gargamel, doesn't he?

1120
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,620
I will give you that.

1121
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,560
Why are we talking about the Smurfs movie?

1122
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,800
Because we're talking about sales and 3D and shit.

1123
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
But you know what though?

1124
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,160
The Muppets movie, there's a lot of the cast from, uh, you know, How I Met Your Mother.

1125
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,160
Fuck yes to the Muppets movie.

1126
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,640
And I can't wait.

1127
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,640
That's going to be me.

1128
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,880
A hundred percent yes to the Muppets movie.

1129
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,280
A hundred percent no to the Smurfs movie.

1130
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,280
Smurfs is terrible.

1131
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,280
All right.

1132
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,280
You know what else is terrible?

1133
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,280
What?

1134
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
Since we're on this tangent train.

1135
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,280
Okay.

1136
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,280
Battleship.

1137
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,280
What the fuck is that?

1138
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,280
Oh my God.

1139
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,280
Oh my God.

1140
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,400
That movie looks a special kind of terrible.

1141
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,520
I saw that you posted the trailer on the Facebook and I think my comment was quote, this looks

1142
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,520
like shit.

1143
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,480
No, Dan showed it to me and my reply was what?

1144
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,360
I'm like, I'm sorry.

1145
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,860
Last time I played Battleship, I didn't, I mean, and the way the trailer looked like

1146
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:43,240
with the configuration of the ships, I was literally expecting Leah Neeson to shout out

1147
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:49,640
I seven and Rhianna to go, girl, you shot my battleship.

1148
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,760
That's what they're setting up.

1149
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,520
It's just like, well, our radar's out.

1150
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:58,200
We have this satellite imagery that we're going to use to plot where we fire stuff and

1151
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:03,320
the enemies, you know, the whatever their missiles or whatever, but the pegs, they spent

1152
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,520
money, lots and lots of money on that movie.

1153
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,780
And what really freaks me out is that they bought the rights to all these other board

1154
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:12,780
games too.

1155
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:18,000
They want to do a new clue movie and I'm like, oh my God, no, no, no, no.

1156
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,680
The one in the eighties was perfect.

1157
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,520
It's a cult classic.

1158
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:28,000
It's Tim Curry at his finest, second finest next to Ferder, third finest next to Ferder

1159
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,440
and Pennywise and fourth finest next to Ferder, Pennywise and whatever in Annie.

1160
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,440
What?

1161
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,440
Oh, what about the demon in Labyrinth?

1162
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,440
God damn it.

1163
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,440
Okay.

1164
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,440
Fifth finest.

1165
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,440
Let's just face it.

1166
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,440
Tim Curry is always awesome.

1167
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,440
Every movie he touches is amazing.

1168
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,440
Even in the worst witch, he was awesome.

1169
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,920
So like, don't make clue like battleship.

1170
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,000
I will cry.

1171
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,160
Like I just expect this scene of Ms. Peacock walking these little squares in the, like,

1172
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,160
oh my God.

1173
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,160
Okay.

1174
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,580
And then all of a sudden aliens come from outer space and you know, says you suck my

1175
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:06,840
battleship and uh, you sunk my battleship.

1176
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,840
Yeah.

1177
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:13,680
Ism said you sunk my box office sales and Frisbee says you sunk my PT boat.

1178
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,680
Uh, yeah.

1179
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,680
Oh, Yahtzee movie.

1180
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,680
Good idea.

1181
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,680
Strelok.

1182
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,680
Okay.

1183
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,720
Tiger Claw and chat says, you know, despite what you see in the trailer, it could be a

1184
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,560
fun popcorn movie if you ignore the fact it's based on a board game.

1185
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:32,080
Go watch the trailer again and then come back and tell me that because maybe getting high

1186
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,760
will be fun, but not like the first half of that trailer.

1187
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,760
Don't get me wrong.

1188
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,440
This is like a really cheesy, you know, this guy's like, you know, he's a loose cannon,

1189
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,920
but he's going to, you know, this battleship thing and then they're like, Hey, what's that

1190
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,920
out there?

1191
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,920
You know, what is that?

1192
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,920
You know, I thought, Oh, okay.

1193
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,560
Maybe it's another boat that they're doing that, you know, it's kinda like Top Gun where

1194
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,640
they're doing exercises and then, you know, Oh, they have to, you know, combat, you know,

1195
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,640
the enemy and stuff like that.

1196
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:04,040
But then it was an alien and I'm like, okay, I can't follow this at all anymore.

1197
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:08,920
I just didn't really have the right, uh, stir lock and chat says monopoly movie.

1198
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,920
God damn.

1199
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
Do they have the rights to monopoly?

1200
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,920
Oh my God.

1201
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,800
Why do I just, I just picture this trailer in my mind and I don't know monopoly.

1202
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,880
I just picture Russell Brand is sitting in a top hat and a monocle going, Oh God, get

1203
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,880
out of jail.

1204
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:28,240
Free called, uh, monopoly, uh, Ouija, they're doing a new Ouija, uh, movie.

1205
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,460
Uh, is it going to be like, Oh, what was the best Ouija movie ever?

1206
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:39,960
The, The Exorcist, seriously, that, that how about which board was based off of a week

1207
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,960
off a Ouija board.

1208
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,960
How about which board?

1209
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,960
Anyhow.

1210
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,960
All right.

1211
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:47,600
I don't want to talk about these horrible movies anymore, although it is, it is related

1212
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,600
to games.

1213
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,840
Every single one of these movies will have a game tie into it.

1214
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,920
You better believe it.

1215
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,640
So there will be something on the Wii that you can get for the battleship movie.

1216
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:01,600
That'll be, you know, Liam Neeson yelling, I seven, I do, by the way, have to quote something

1217
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:07,280
from Tumblr if you watch, um, The Exorcist backwards, it's about a girl who's really

1218
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,560
sick and then eat some pea soup and gets better.

1219
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,560
Shut up.

1220
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:17,760
I, uh, uh, I'll bring it up later, but I'm trying to find that list of movies that they

1221
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,760
have.

1222
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,560
Maybe we'll save it for like the afterbirth or something, but it's terrible.

1223
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,560
I know.

1224
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,560
All right.

1225
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,920
Can we move on?

1226
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,880
Let's talk about other three DS related news real quick.

1227
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,320
I think you already know about this, but I've got to just jump in here and say this.

1228
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:39,360
Uh, there are new three DS games coming this holiday season, namely Mario Kart, three DS

1229
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,600
and super Mario three DS.

1230
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:44,680
It's apparently has a name now, the Mario game, which was just kind of snuck in there.

1231
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:48,240
That was the other weird thing about this week and the Nintendo, like all this other

1232
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,440
news that just kind of showed up in the press releases.

1233
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,000
Like the fact that original NES games were coming to virtual console, that just was kind

1234
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
of, Oh yeah.

1235
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,040
Well, since we're giving them away, we're just going to throw that out there.

1236
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,160
I have to point out something to LAHA.

1237
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,380
There was a dungeon and dragons movie.

1238
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,480
It was pretty bad.

1239
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,760
Tom Baker was in it.

1240
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,800
However, yeah, the kid from cereal mom was in it.

1241
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,480
There was a sequel by the way.

1242
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:21,240
And just to, um, let you know the movie crawl that came out when I was pretty young, I saw

1243
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,240
it in the theater.

1244
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:26,080
I'll put it that way was supposed to be the dungeon and dragons movie and they lost the

1245
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,640
license for it.

1246
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:32,640
So dungeons and dragons has been done for the record though.

1247
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,480
I did kind of like the dungeon and dragons and dragons and dragons.

1248
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,720
You will believe that a Wayans can be an elf.

1249
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,720
He wasn't enough.

1250
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,720
What was he?

1251
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,720
He played a human.

1252
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,040
I thought he was a human thief.

1253
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,040
Really?

1254
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,040
Tom Baker played an elf.

1255
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:49,640
Oh, he played the king of the elves and Tom Baker is awesome because he was the fourth

1256
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,640
doctor.

1257
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,640
So shut up everybody.

1258
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:57,520
Anyway, Mario Kart seven as it's being called right now, it will be out in December and

1259
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,560
Super Mario 3D land will be out in November.

1260
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:07,080
No further information still on Kid Icarus, which is also supposed to be this holiday,

1261
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,160
but they haven't exactly said when that is.

1262
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,080
And now there's a little bit of concern that maybe it's not going to make this year.

1263
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,040
You know the best part about Mario Kart seven according to Kotaku, it's actually the ninth

1264
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,440
Mario Kart game.

1265
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,440
Is it really?

1266
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,440
Yes it is.

1267
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,560
What games did they forget?

1268
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,560
Arcade ones.

1269
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,680
Uh, well I think it's Nintendo didn't really develop the arcade ones.

1270
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:30,040
Didn't Namco do those because that's why it's still Mario Kart.

1271
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,560
There was a Pac-Man movie by the way, but it was animated.

1272
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,400
They would not be considered canon.

1273
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,800
I would support calling it Mario Kart seven because the arcade ones are not canon.

1274
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,880
They're not as good either.

1275
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,000
They're really not like they're okay for arcade games I guess, but they're not the same quality

1276
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,360
as the home ones.

1277
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,840
And unlike Loki, I love me some Mario Kart and I am looking forward to this new one.

1278
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:56,920
As long as it's not double dash bad, then I am looking forward to the new one.

1279
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,200
I did actually have to point out that just about everything that Laha suggested, there

1280
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,380
actually have been movies.

1281
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,380
There was a Pac-Man movie.

1282
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,380
It was animated.

1283
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,800
There was a Pac-Man TV show back in the day.

1284
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,800
Yes there was.

1285
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,800
It was the same series.

1286
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,800
The movie was in the same series.

1287
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,440
There's also Pac-Man save Santa Claus.

1288
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,960
Hey I watched it.

1289
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,480
You know what my two shows were when I was a kid?

1290
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,060
It was Pac-Man and Qbert.

1291
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,920
I watched the Qbert cartoon too.

1292
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,920
Alright let's move on.

1293
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,440
Half the Line gagged me with a rocket ship.

1294
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:29,420
Candyland was also one of the other licenses that they had.

1295
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,800
It was Monopoly Battleship Candyland and Ouija.

1296
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,800
Great.

1297
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:39,720
I hope Patrick Stewart stars in Candyland.

1298
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,960
Set course for Yellow Square.

1299
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:42,960
Engage.

1300
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,680
Spock is not impressed.

1301
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,040
So did they get Chutes and Ladders too?

1302
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,040
Alright.

1303
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,440
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?

1304
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,440
How about Hi Ho Cheerio?

1305
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,440
Okay.

1306
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,560
How about a story?

1307
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,760
This is stupid.

1308
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,000
And I'm gonna say why it's stupid after I read it.

1309
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,640
Basically the ESA wants 1.1 million dollars of reimbursement from the state of California

1310
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,360
for the law that failed.

1311
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,200
Basically it's for Brown versus EMA.

1312
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:16,420
And basically the whole point is that, and this is a quote, California persisted in defending

1313
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:21,060
a law that plaintiffs warned of the legislature was unconstitutional before it passed.

1314
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:25,240
That was previously found to be unconstitutional by the district court and a unanimous panel

1315
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:30,400
of the 9th circuit and that is similar to at least 8 other laws invalidated as unconstitutional

1316
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,080
prior to the time California sought seriatory in this case.

1317
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:40,320
So basically, like, you knew, but you pursued it anyway because you're stupid?

1318
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,320
Pay us.

1319
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,400
We spent a lot of money beating your ass.

1320
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,640
Pay us.

1321
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:55,480
Now California did send, um, a check for $282,794 for reimbursement for legal fees.

1322
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:02,440
However, um, we're broke in California.

1323
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,640
That's kind of where I'm at.

1324
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:09,320
I'm like, I'm like, yeah, ESA kind of deserves it, but at the same time we don't have the

1325
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,500
money right now.

1326
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,720
So you just need to...

1327
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,680
I'm going to tell you what's going to happen, ESA.

1328
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,600
Listen to me, representatives of the ESA.

1329
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,320
This is what's going to happen if you get your money.

1330
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:22,280
They're going to find another tax to raise or increase our tuition again or do something

1331
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:29,600
else and it's going to hurt the people you're trying to, that pretty much fund your operation.

1332
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,920
This is so hard because I can see it from both sides, but from the ESA, the ESA spent

1333
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,720
a lot of money defending something that should have never been sent a law in the first place.

1334
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,680
They were defending our rights.

1335
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,720
And so it's kind of like they, they should be entitled to that money.

1336
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,240
But I, I am with you.

1337
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,000
I know damn well that money is not going to come out of thin air and there's so much...

1338
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It doesn't need to come out of thin air.

1339
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,960
It needs to come out of fucking Lila Nee's ass is where it needs to fucking come from.

1340
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,040
That's I think that's where the money should come from.

1341
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,040
Absolutely.

1342
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,120
They need to take it right from the source.

1343
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:06,080
I honestly think that any of these politicians that have basically brought up anything like

1344
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,080
this that have failed, that spent our taxpayer dollars, cause you know, he didn't pay anything

1345
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,840
out of pocket for any of this shit.

1346
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,380
Anything that comes out of our pockets as taxpayers, the ones responsible for the failed

1347
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:20,320
law need to pay and pay it themselves.

1348
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,520
He want to put his name on it for all the fucking fame.

1349
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,760
Well, you know what?

1350
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,680
You put your name on that shit and now you need to pay for it because you know, what

1351
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:31,840
kind of reprimand is he going to get for coming up with this law?

1352
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,040
Obviously he didn't fucking learn anything.

1353
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,160
He's like, well, I'm going to just try it again.

1354
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,660
You know, it's like, you know, Well, you know what?

1355
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:42,880
This is actually some something, cause you know, here in California, basically we are

1356
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,800
pretty much a direct democracy here.

1357
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,440
We can vote on what we want.

1358
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,200
All you have to do is have enough signatures to put it on the ballot and it can be voted

1359
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,360
on.

1360
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:59,140
And this is something that I would seriously sit back and pen a potential, and I've got

1361
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:03,320
friends that will, you know, will review the legal side of it for me for free.

1362
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:08,280
This is something that I would sit back and pen myself that a politician needs to be responsible

1363
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,320
for anything they do that fails.

1364
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,520
You know, if they cost the taxpayer money on a failed venture, then it needs to come

1365
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,840
out of their personal pocket or they need to have them cut and pay.

1366
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:22,320
I don't want to get too political, but I could see, but you wouldn't want to scare off a

1367
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,560
politician from doing something that maybe they really should be doing.

1368
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,400
You know, there's got, there's, there's a middle ground somewhere.

1369
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,420
I know, but there, and you're right, but we got, you have to be very careful in how you

1370
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:37,680
word something like that is that the court should be able to find the person liable when

1371
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,320
gross negligence is shown.

1372
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:44,760
There needs to be something that the judge could do it, but not like you wouldn't want

1373
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:50,980
all politicians to have to suffer because of people constantly going after rights and

1374
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:51,980
things like that.

1375
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:55,520
But I mean, but I mean, it would have to be on a case by case basis, but I'm saying in

1376
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:02,640
particular or something like this, and this is why I honestly don't, don't get me started.

1377
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,960
I have a big problem with politicians in general, except for, you know, the ones that are pretty

1378
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,260
much putting out their own money for stuff that needs to be done because they're still

1379
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,560
out there.

1380
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,060
But this, and again, we're broke in California.

1381
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:22,600
We have no money, even though we have some of the highest grossing, you know, income

1382
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:29,540
people in the country that live in our state, are they being taxed any more, you know, relatively

1383
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,360
any more than we are?

1384
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,320
No, because of Republicans.

1385
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:39,280
Anyway, but I'm saying that when you come to the point that we don't have any more money

1386
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:43,840
to pay on any of this and they're still going and pursuing stuff that they know is going

1387
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:49,640
to cost us money, what's the point?

1388
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,060
And when is that going to stop?

1389
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,240
They're going to keep doing stupid shit.

1390
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,880
Just look at all the, look at all the dumb laws they have in San Francisco.

1391
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:56,880
Seriously.

1392
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,880
Yeah.

1393
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,920
And they were going to try to ban circumcision.

1394
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,000
The whole circumcision thing that went on the ballot and had to be thrown out.

1395
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,440
I think it was thrown out by a judge that it's not going to be on the ballot because,

1396
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,440
you know, it was just too ridiculous or whatever legal thing they decided.

1397
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,800
And besides that, it is, it would infringe on religious rights, so.

1398
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,800
Right.

1399
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,160
But I mean, it's just so- But it's like, who paid for that?

1400
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,800
Who paid for that whole process?

1401
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,520
They pay, the reason why I think it's so expensive to live in San Francisco is because they have

1402
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,080
a bunch of ridiculous laws that aren't necessary.

1403
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,960
None of us elsewhere have to deal with it.

1404
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,000
Just in San Francisco, they have this shit.

1405
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,080
But I mean, I don't want to get too political here, but some could look and say, in San

1406
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,720
Francisco, everyone has health care.

1407
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,720
We'll see.

1408
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,720
Okay.

1409
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,720
That's one I agree with.

1410
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:45,320
But I'm saying there's other- Anyhow, all right.

1411
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,880
We got to, we got to not.

1412
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,400
I think Jamie needs a spinoff show that's political.

1413
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,480
No cause then I would be harsh and have a headache.

1414
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,480
Called Stitchin' Bitch.

1415
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,480
All right.

1416
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,480
Let's move on.

1417
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:58,040
Uh, Loki, what do you have for us?

1418
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,040
Back to gaming.

1419
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:04,480
Uh, GameStop is now prepared to offer downloadable PC purchases at retail, much like they do

1420
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:12,360
right now with digital purchases for DLC and stuff like that.

1421
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:15,320
I mean, great if you want to do that.

1422
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:19,640
I mean, if you're trading used items for, like, download content or something like that.

1423
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:25,920
But I mean, much like I don't see the point in download content being purchased at retail,

1424
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,960
I don't really see the point of buying a digital PC title at retail.

1425
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:36,000
I mean, shit, if you're going to go to retail to buy a digital title, like, say, you know,

1426
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,840
any game that's out there now that, you know, it's like a major game, like, say like a Deus

1427
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,720
Ex, Human Revolution, or something like that, just buy the boxed copy.

1428
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,840
I mean, if you're going to fucking pay money for it at retail anyways, why are you going

1429
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,640
to pay money for a code to go download it for digitally?

1430
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,640
I mean, it's just...

1431
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,920
I think GameCroc's just trying to do what they have to do to stay relevant, but it ain't

1432
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,920
going to work.

1433
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:57,920
Period.

1434
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,160
Yeah, I mean, they're saying that, like, for example, uh, the first game, yeah, actually,

1435
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,680
Deus Ex is the first game that'll be an in-store digital purchase, says those who purchase

1436
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:10,920
the digital versions will also receive downloads for the original Deus Ex Game of the Year

1437
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,040
edition and Deus Ex Invisible War.

1438
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,800
So that's kind of how you get a little bit of extra stuff.

1439
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:20,920
Customers will also receive explosive mission DLC and double power-up rewards points.

1440
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,320
I mean, I guess that's cool if you want all those extras.

1441
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:29,040
I mean, I know Steam does a lot of, like, extras like that as well.

1442
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:35,240
I guess it's just really, you know, if that's important to you, then I'd go that route.

1443
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:40,960
But if you're just looking to buy, you know, digital stuff, I mean, it's kind of like the

1444
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,160
whole point of buying digital in the first place is so you don't have to go to the store.

1445
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,800
But I guess if you're young enough and you don't have a credit card or something like

1446
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,840
that, then that may be the only way to go.

1447
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,640
But I still think it's ridiculous.

1448
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,640
But whatever, you know.

1449
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,280
It's what they want to do.

1450
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,560
Power to the players, as they say.

1451
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,320
It'd be really neat if I could, like, get into the used game market with this stuff.

1452
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:07,960
Like, I should be able to, like, Steam, revoke my access to a game and I get, like, a credit

1453
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:12,240
to use on the store and then somebody else can buy the game at a reduced price or something.

1454
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:16,960
I know that'll never happen, but if you think about it, they could do something where the

1455
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,440
publisher would get a cut of that.

1456
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,580
And that doesn't happen right now in the retail stores.

1457
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:26,260
There could be a way, if publishers are smarter about the used game market, where they could

1458
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:29,000
get a cut of it.

1459
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,080
And I'm not just talking these $10 online passes, but whatever.

1460
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:40,080
Anyhow, moving on, speaking of prices, Xbox Live Arcade.

1461
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,800
Have you noticed something about the games on Xbox Live Arcade?

1462
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,840
Yeah, the points have been slowly rising.

1463
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,040
That's right, the cost of the games have been rising on Xbox Live.

1464
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:54,840
So far, in 2011, there have been 20 1200-plus games.

1465
01:13:54,840 --> 01:14:00,060
Last year, 27 of the 85 games released for the service cost 1200 points or more.

1466
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,640
So we're already at 20 for this year.

1467
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:09,360
So that was an 8% increase in itself over 2009, when 21 titles hit that price point.

1468
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:14,520
Now they are saying that, well, we have to blame the fact that the quality of games we're

1469
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,160
basically making is a lot higher too.

1470
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:22,040
Limbo and Castle Crashers, they're as good as anything else that's out on the market.

1471
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,040
What do you guys think?

1472
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,880
Do you think that Xbox Live Arcade games are getting better and therefore they're worth

1473
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:33,520
the extra money, or do you think this is just inflation when we're not paying attention?

1474
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,240
I think it's inflation.

1475
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,080
I think it's a little bit of a mix of both.

1476
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:42,520
I think, yes, it's inflation going on, but at the same time, you really don't see anymore

1477
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,220
like just crappy, lazy arcade ports.

1478
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:51,120
Ever since Microsoft banned those from the service, you don't see any more of this just

1479
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,760
re-release of an old-ass game that's 400 Microsoft points.

1480
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,760
Most of the stuff that's coming out now definitely had a lot of development dollars put into

1481
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,000
it with mixed success.

1482
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Some of it's really good.

1483
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Some of it's not so good.

1484
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,520
It just depends on what kind of games you're into.

1485
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,000
I think it's a little bit of both.

1486
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
And you know what?

1487
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
That's fine.

1488
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,120
They want to put out $20 games because you don't have to buy them, and no one's forcing

1489
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,120
you to buy them.

1490
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,120
And you know what?

1491
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:22,040
If you're smart, you wait, and then sometimes when that game pops up onto the deal of the

1492
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,840
week, then you buy it for a cheaper price.

1493
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,840
And I still do.

1494
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:28,600
I will say one thing I do love is that you still get the demos, and that's something

1495
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,720
you can't always get at a retail store.

1496
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,840
So that is one thing I really like.

1497
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,560
And I can really, really try a game before I buy it.

1498
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:41,960
So Xbox Live Arcade, even though the prices are creeping up, as long as the quality stays

1499
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:46,340
good, I mean, there's been a lot of good arcade games I've played lately, I guess it's okay.

1500
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,340
So we'll see.

1501
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,340
Dar Sakura.

1502
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:51,840
Well, in other news, this actually is for our UK listeners.

1503
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,480
The shop game restarted its Play Now, Trade Later deal.

1504
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:02,920
So basically, you can buy a game and trade it in at a guaranteed amount, so you essentially

1505
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:07,120
end up paying 5 pounds for your game.

1506
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:14,280
And the games that are included on this list is UFC Trainer for Wii, Cars 2 on DS, Art

1507
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:18,800
Academy, Calaveras the Cartel, Hunted, The Demon's Forge, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows

1508
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,640
Part 2 for Wii.

1509
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,880
So it's a number of games, you'd have to check with your local game store to find out.

1510
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:29,640
But this is going, basically if you trade in any of those games for credit before August

1511
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,040
12th, they'll effectively cost 5 pounds.

1512
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,000
You can use the credit on any future purchase.

1513
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,200
So that's pretty good, I mean, it's a good way to save money, especially if these are

1514
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,600
games that you got and you're kind of like, eh, meh.

1515
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:48,360
Sounds like a really weird way of doing like a demo or like a rental service.

1516
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:53,640
Well, in February, they also had one where it guaranteed a 35 pound trade in for shooters

1517
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,440
like Killzone 3 and Bulletstorm.

1518
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,960
So it's a good way to basically revolt stock.

1519
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:00,960
So.

1520
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,960
Hmm.

1521
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,200
Well, we'll see how successful this is.

1522
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,080
I don't know, none of those games are making me go, ooh, gotta get it.

1523
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,800
I mean, granted, I live in the wrong country anyway, but we'll see.

1524
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,400
Well, good luck.

1525
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:16,920
Alright, well, let's travel the world and talk about release dates and what upcoming

1526
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:22,640
games you could maybe get a 5 pound deal or a 5 dollar deal on later.

1527
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:29,680
Well, not a whole lot this week, and at least there's some games coming up this week, because

1528
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:33,840
there's a few weeks coming up here where there's nothing.

1529
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,680
Starting off, Phineas and Ferb, Across the Second Dimension.

1530
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,680
I love Phineas and Ferb.

1531
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:41,320
It's coming out on PlayStation 3 with move support.

1532
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,040
How much is it?

1533
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,000
We, I believe, 40 dollars.

1534
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,560
Do you love Phineas and Ferb, 40 dollars much?

1535
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,960
No, I'll just keep watching episodes off the internet.

1536
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:51,960
There you go.

1537
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,040
Well, it's not a bad game, actually.

1538
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:58,040
It's done by the people who did Ratchet and Clank, so, you know, if you like Ratchet and

1539
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,240
Clank, then it might be worth picking up.

1540
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:06,520
So yeah, Phineas and Ferb, yeah, 40 dollars retail on PlayStation 3, Wii, and the DS.

1541
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:12,120
Well, DS, of course, is 30, not 40, that'd be ridiculous.

1542
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:17,400
Sesame Street, Ready Set Grover coming out on the DS and the Wii, DS version has a funny

1543
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,400
little Grover stylus.

1544
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:22,240
Aw, bummer, I thought it might be that Kinect game that they were showing at E3.

1545
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,280
No, no, that got delayed.

1546
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:30,480
Sesame, on the Wii version, you get a Grover fuzzy Wii remote cover.

1547
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:34,480
Wait, wait, you said that really quick, that got delayed?

1548
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,960
Delayed to when, next year?

1549
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,840
No, just in the fall.

1550
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:39,840
Like October.

1551
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,560
Oh, I guess, I thought that was when it was always set to come out.

1552
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,720
Mmm, it was August at one point.

1553
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:56,160
But anyways, um, and then of course, let's see here, is that really it?

1554
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:02,160
Oh yeah, I forgot, Saints Row Special Edition 2-pack, they're basically re-releasing the

1555
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,480
Saints Row double pack that they had a while ago where you can get one and two, but this

1556
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:10,920
also gives you early access to the Initiation Station demo that they're gonna be having

1557
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,040
coming out later on.

1558
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:19,240
Bleach Soul Resurrection for the Playstation 3, this is gonna be kind of like a Dice Warrior

1559
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:26,000
type of game, also you get three free episodes, or the anime episodes on Playstation Network

1560
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,240
with that, you get a voucher for that, it's kinda cool.

1561
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:38,160
Sniper Ghost Warrior Extended Edition, that's coming out on 360, and that's it.

1562
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:43,360
I love the enthusiasm in the chatroom shown by Sturlok at chat.hornslaunchradio.com.

1563
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:50,040
Sturlok says, yay Grover, he was my favorite when I was a kid, him and Cookie Monster.

1564
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:56,600
Back in my day, Elmo didn't exist on the old school Sesame Street back when I was a kid.

1565
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,000
Which we like to refer to as the good old days.

1566
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,160
That's right.

1567
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:04,360
Brakeman says, I preferred the Muppets, I liked Muppet Babies, but it was always about

1568
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,360
Fraggle Rock.

1569
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,120
I don't know about you guys, but anyhow.

1570
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,320
Fraggle Rock is awesome.

1571
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:12,440
Alright, going to Japanese release dates, it's kind of a slow week over there as well,

1572
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,800
but on the Xbox 360 this week you get a couple of price reductions, including Assassin's

1573
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:20,560
Creed Brotherhood Special Edition and Tropico 3 both move into the Platinum Collection,

1574
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,400
that's on the 4th of August on the Xbox 360.

1575
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:28,600
Going over to the Playstation 3, we have Assassin's Creed Brotherhood there as well, and then

1576
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:34,080
another game getting a price reduction, this has a whopper of a name, it's R. Tonelico

1577
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:41,360
3, Sekai Shun no Hikigane wa Shujo no Utagahajuku gets a price reduction this week.

1578
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,860
I have no idea what game this is.

1579
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:43,860
This looks like...

1580
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:45,520
It's R. Tonelico.

1581
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,720
It's a role playing game, and of course it looks like you can dress the little girls

1582
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:54,840
up as bunnies in the game, and I can see a little item shop in some of these pictures.

1583
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,920
The game looks kind of cool, but I don't think we have this here.

1584
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:57,920
Yeah we do.

1585
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,040
Not number 3 I don't think, we have number 2 at least.

1586
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,040
What game is this?

1587
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,040
It's R. Tonelico.

1588
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,040
Oh.

1589
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,040
I didn't know that was out here.

1590
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,040
Yeah, it's out here.

1591
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,040
Oh, there you go.

1592
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,040
It looks interesting, maybe I'll check it out.

1593
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:13,120
Alright, let's see, moving on to other consoles, I don't know if Nintendo has anything on their

1594
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:19,320
lineup that I will check, but I can't do the PSP, we do have a couple games there.

1595
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:26,560
We have Storm Lover, Summer Love from D3, Toriyoko, Gourmet Survival, what is that, like

1596
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,560
Iron Chef or Die?

1597
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,560
Gourmet Survival!

1598
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:33,320
No, it doesn't look like it has anything to do with cooking.

1599
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:37,080
It does look like some type of like you're fighting dinosaurs and gorillas, like you

1600
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,920
take on primates.

1601
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:45,480
Like look at that, this dude's fighting like the guy at the top of the Matterhorn at Disneyland.

1602
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,200
That's what it looks like.

1603
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:51,640
Man vs Beast, that's what that is.

1604
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:57,040
That's on the PSP this week, as well as Yuusha 32nd from Marvelous comes out this week as

1605
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,040
well.

1606
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:01,000
I wonder if that's a version of 30 Second Hero, or Half Minute, oh yes it is, it's Half

1607
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,960
Minute Hero Part 2 comes out this week in Japan, that could be a lot of fun.

1608
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:12,560
So that's on the PSP this week, and going to the Nintendo Wii, Epic Mickey gets a release

1609
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,040
in Japan this week finally, so they must have localized it for Japan, I know Disney's pretty

1610
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,200
big over there, so they probably took a little while for them to localize it all.

1611
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,440
They had to add Duffy to it.

1612
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,440
Maybe.

1613
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,160
Because Duffy is bigger than Mickey in Japan.

1614
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,160
Is it really?

1615
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,600
Actually Duffy is pretty big.

1616
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:33,040
Family fishing as well on the Wii, and lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Nazo Waku Yakata

1617
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,760
Otono Aida Ni Ade Ni comes out.

1618
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:40,920
This looks like, is this a Professor Layton game?

1619
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,400
It would appear so.

1620
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,560
So it's Professor Layton's Haunted Mansion or something like that on the 3DS.

1621
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,960
There you go, your Japanese release dates.

1622
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,920
As I horribly butcher the names as I always do.

1623
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,080
In Europe, two things.

1624
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,040
Limbo for PC and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.

1625
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,040
On Xbox 360.

1626
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,240
That is an awesome game.

1627
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,240
That's it.

1628
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:02,240
That is an incredibly awesome game.

1629
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:06,600
I heard it was not leaked early, but there was some URL where you could get the game

1630
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,000
early through the store or something.

1631
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
How is it?

1632
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Haven't played it yet.

1633
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
But I want to.

1634
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I haven't got a chance to play it.

1635
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I got it downloaded.

1636
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,800
So how do you know it's amazing?

1637
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,800
Based on the videos.

1638
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:17,800
Oh I see.

1639
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,080
I'm making an assumption based on trailers.

1640
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,080
It looks amazing.

1641
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,680
I'm just giving you crap.

1642
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,400
It looks monochrome.

1643
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:30,920
Well, it's got a unique art style to it.

1644
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:35,220
Insanely Twisted.

1645
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:40,680
So let's talk a little bit more about earnings and lack thereof.

1646
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:49,280
THQ is disappointed in their earnings for fiscal quarter 2, including Red Faction and

1647
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,080
the performance of that.

1648
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,600
And they are thinking, of course, quarter 3 could be its best.

1649
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:59,880
Oh I'm sorry, it was quarter 1 that they were pissed off about.

1650
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:03,000
These fiscal quarters get confusing.

1651
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,560
Of course they are saying, sales of Red Faction Armageddon and our licensed kid titles were

1652
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,740
below expectations.

1653
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:15,320
The late release of UFC Personal Trainer also adversely impacted the quarter.

1654
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:23,120
You know, THQ, I mean, you had a Kung Fu Panda game come out and you decided to make it You

1655
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,120
Draw Only.

1656
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:30,140
Not a good choice, I gotta say.

1657
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:35,200
Of course they are saying that the net loss of $38.4 million, and most of the losses are

1658
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,320
from deferred revenue.

1659
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:43,960
Of course the company is not counting yet, because it's going towards their online services

1660
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:44,960
for its games.

1661
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:52,480
And of course Q3 for them is going to be Saints of the Third, WWE 12, and the You Draw tablet

1662
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,560
for the 360 and PS3, among other things.

1663
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:03,680
Red Faction did so poorly that it will not be continuing on in any meaningful way.

1664
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:06,760
So it is done, fortunately.

1665
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,000
Your break man is crying in our chat room over the death of Red Faction.

1666
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
How do you feel about it, Loki?

1667
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Weren't you a fan of that series?

1668
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Nope.

1669
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Never really.

1670
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Why not?

1671
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I just didn't play it.

1672
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
It's not that I don't like it or anything.

1673
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I mean, it looked cool.

1674
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
It's volition.

1675
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I love volition.

1676
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,200
So it's part your fault that the series died, basically.

1677
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,760
Yeah, it's because I didn't buy it.

1678
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:24,760
Exactly.

1679
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:32,600
So if you are mad about the death of Red Faction, just send those cards and letters to Loki.

1680
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,600
So yeah.

1681
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,400
It just didn't do that well.

1682
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,160
And you would have thought, you know, a game with a unicorn that shoots rainbows out of

1683
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,160
its ass.

1684
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,160
It would have been awesome.

1685
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:45,920
Which, by the way, I hope to God that they bring that weapon over to Saints Row the Third,

1686
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,720
because that would be amazing.

1687
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:53,120
And then of course, one of the things that they were experimenting with, starting with

1688
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:58,800
MX vs ATV, is releasing a game for a lower price point and then hoping to make that money

1689
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,880
up back with download content.

1690
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,720
So they did try that with MX vs ATV Alive.

1691
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:12,500
They put it out at $39.99, and their idea was of course to come out with a robust product

1692
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:17,360
at $39.99 price point, build a large install base more quickly, and then monetize that

1693
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:22,080
install base through rapid and large number of DLC drops.

1694
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,600
Unfortunately it didn't work.

1695
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:29,040
It says, the only problem is the game didn't move enough units to turn, or in turn, move

1696
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,960
enough download content to make the experiment a success.

1697
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:39,840
So the key to learning was that it was not a successful experiment.

1698
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,960
The $39.99 price point, while good, gave us good acceleration of sales, but that wasn't

1699
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:49,520
enough to drive the install base where we wanted it to be, obviously.

1700
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:54,480
It just wasn't working out.

1701
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:59,200
Break Man in chat is calling you Darth Loki.

1702
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,640
He's very upset about this whole Red Faction thing, just so you know.

1703
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,440
You know who you need to blame, okay?

1704
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:08,360
You know who put their logo onto that game?

1705
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,360
That would be Syfy.

1706
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,800
Syfy Channel had a fucking movie.

1707
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,880
That was Syfy Games.

1708
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:22,880
If you want to talk about someone putting out a poor product, that would be Syfy.

1709
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,560
So that's who you need to blame.

1710
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:30,440
So yeah, that kind of sucks for them, but at least you know what?

1711
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:33,600
I can guarantee that Quarter 3 is going to be amazing, because fucking Saints for the

1712
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,600
Third.

1713
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,080
That shit is going to sell like crazy.

1714
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,080
Nice.

1715
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:43,480
Alright, well, part of me didn't want to talk about this next story, but this next story

1716
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:44,720
just really makes me angry.

1717
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:50,120
There's so much to hate in this next story, and I apologize for bringing it up, but you

1718
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,120
know what?

1719
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:55,840
This should piss you off too, because you have the power to change things.

1720
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:01,560
As you guys know, if you ever watch a television, you know that there was a horrible, horrible

1721
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:08,240
tragedy in Norway this past week, and you had this just crazy asshole, and I'm not even

1722
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,240
going to say his name.

1723
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,440
I'm not going to show you his picture, because he doesn't deserve to have it shown.

1724
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:17,500
He's a crazy asshole, and he blew up a building, and he shot a bunch of kids at a camp, because

1725
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,800
I guess he was afraid of what they were going to grow up into or something like that.

1726
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:25,820
Just bullshit excuse for doing a crazy, batshit, stupid thing that killed like 77 people, including

1727
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:28,200
a bunch of teenagers, which is beyond fucked.

1728
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:33,040
I mean, this guy is worse than Satan.

1729
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,960
He's worse than Satan's farts.

1730
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:35,960
He's just terrible.

1731
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:38,760
He's a terrible human being, but yeah.

1732
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:45,480
So anyway, obviously, this horrific thing happened, and what happens when a horrific

1733
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,880
situation happens?

1734
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,940
You want to blame something.

1735
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:48,940
You want to blame someone?

1736
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:49,940
You want to blame something.

1737
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:51,800
So why am I bringing it up here on Orange Lawns Radio?

1738
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:52,800
Guess who got blamed?

1739
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,800
Video game.

1740
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,800
That's right.

1741
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:00,120
Video game retailers have pulled World of Warcraft and Call of Duty after the shooting,

1742
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:05,240
some of the big retailers, because I guess this asshole wrote some manifesto that either

1743
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,320
talked about the games.

1744
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:12,120
I think he had actually said he learned how to shoot or whatever in Call of Duty, which

1745
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:17,320
I don't know why you would take what a crazy asshole says at face value, but whatever.

1746
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:24,360
I mean, this just infuriates me, because it's like, don't pay attention to this stupid asshole.

1747
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:29,960
By banning these games, I feel like you're validating what he says, and that's the last

1748
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,800
thing you should do in a situation like this.

1749
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,400
It's so irritating.

1750
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:39,820
He said that Warcraft provided a useful cover story for the time he spent in seclusion plotting

1751
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:41,440
his terrorist attacks.

1752
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:46,000
So it wasn't even that he was playing WoW, it's just saying he was playing WoW made it

1753
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,680
for a good excuse.

1754
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:53,000
And then playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was a way to keep his skills honed.

1755
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,860
So the retailers Co-Op Norway and Plate Companyit, I can't say these Norwegian names, but something

1756
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,760
like that, they pulled the games.

1757
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:07,080
They are saying it's a temporary removal, but as far as I'm concerned, you know what,

1758
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,360
don't validate this guy.

1759
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,360
Irritating.

1760
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:16,320
Now, we will say this, Spaceworld is another retailer, they refused to pull the games,

1761
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,920
saying it saw no connection between the games and the tragedy.

1762
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:25,320
Quote, we have never seen any research that games alone have led to such incidents.

1763
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:30,920
So if you live in Norway, that would be A plus Spaceworld, F minus these other guys.

1764
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:33,760
So shame on that.

1765
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:38,440
But then of course, it doesn't end there.

1766
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,600
There was a very interesting opinion piece that showed up on a Forbes blog.

1767
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,420
Of course, Forbes magazine, hugely financial, right?

1768
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:49,000
And so this guy, now granted, this is an opinion piece, but he talks about an expert saying

1769
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
that if you blame video games for the tragic massacres, like what happened in Norway, what

1770
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,320
happened in Columbine, it's racist.

1771
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:03,400
I don't know if that's the word I would choose to use, but I guess that's what this

1772
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,120
article is saying here.

1773
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:09,600
Clinical psychologist Christopher Ferguson, a leading expert on video game violence and

1774
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,520
mass killings at Texas A&M International University said, video games aren't to blame for the

1775
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:17,160
tragedy, nor is Doom, nor is Quake, and so on.

1776
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:23,920
In fact, he believes that placing the blame on video games whenever a white male is guilty

1777
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:28,360
of a killing spree is racist.

1778
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:34,920
Weird, but I can't say he's told, I don't know.

1779
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:39,040
Keep in mind, keep in mind, and this is something that needs to be defined for the entirety

1780
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,960
of America.

1781
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,920
Racism does not mean white against black, white against this.

1782
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:50,200
It means one race against another.

1783
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:54,560
Or it's making a judgment based on racial factors only.

1784
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,560
Correct.

1785
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:01,340
And this time he's saying because white males commit heinous acts, instantly blaming

1786
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:04,960
video games is racist.

1787
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:05,960
I would say bigoted.

1788
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:06,960
Yeah, I know.

1789
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:07,960
That's a better word.

1790
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:10,200
Racist just isn't the right word for me.

1791
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,840
But it is sort of profiling.

1792
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:13,840
That's a good word.

1793
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:14,840
Profiling.

1794
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:19,920
But racist, I think that word cuts really deep.

1795
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:25,880
For lack of the better, or maybe just for, you know, shock value, but it really is profiling

1796
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,320
and a bit of bigotry.

1797
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:30,320
Yeah.

1798
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,120
That's what it is.

1799
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:36,040
And the doctor goes on to say, mass killings are going to happen and there's nothing anyone

1800
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,440
can do about it.

1801
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:41,560
Fortunately, they're not going to happen very often, but they're like lightning strikes.

1802
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:46,240
Let's see, quote, I know it's a little controversial to say, but there's a certain type of racism

1803
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,800
in place of these killings.

1804
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:51,880
When shootings happen in an inner city in minority populated schools, video games are

1805
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:52,880
never brought up.

1806
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:56,640
But when these things happen in white majority schools and in the suburbs, people start to

1807
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,920
freak out and video games are inevitably blamed.

1808
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:03,320
I think that there's a certain element of racism or ignorance here.

1809
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:07,640
People really want to know what kind of boogeyman we can hang this on and video games are still

1810
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:11,280
the top choice when it comes to any type of tragedy.

1811
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:15,800
If you want to read more on this, you can go to blog.forbes.com and read the full article

1812
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,800
there.

1813
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,800
Let me read another quote from this.

1814
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:22,160
It's just really interesting, for lack of a better word.

1815
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:25,760
There are groups out there who are going to blame video games on everything.

1816
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,040
They're like ambulance chasers, really.

1817
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:32,000
I think it's irresponsible and thoughtless to try to make political gain off of someone

1818
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,760
else's tragedy, but they're going to do it.

1819
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:35,760
That's what they do.

1820
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,800
But even those groups have been much quieter with the Oslo tragedy.

1821
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:42,720
And you know, we had another follow up story in our show role that I neglected to copy

1822
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:47,400
the link for, but in a nutshell, some crazy religious group is trying to get the games

1823
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,680
banned here in the U.S. because of the Norway shooting.

1824
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,360
And that quote I agree with.

1825
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:58,540
These guys are like ambulance chasers to push their own agenda and they are exploiting a

1826
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:02,800
disgusting scenario to promote their own agenda and that is sick.

1827
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,640
And that part I agree with.

1828
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,000
So really fascinating study.

1829
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I don't know.

1830
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Draw your own opinions.

1831
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Choose your own words.

1832
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
But, you know.

1833
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,040
Well, you know, you know what the whole thing is?

1834
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:21,440
And this is my little commentary on the whole situation.

1835
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,400
Stop looking for something to blame other than the people themselves.

1836
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,400
Yeah.

1837
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:29,120
Kaishudo in the chat room says, Rob, don't jump on the side of one nut case that goes

1838
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,240
against another nut case's view.

1839
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,540
I'm not totally with this guy.

1840
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:37,720
Like I said, I get what he's saying, but I don't know if racism would be the word I'd

1841
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:38,720
use.

1842
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,200
Like profiling, like Jamie said, I think is maybe a better word to use.

1843
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:47,000
But, you know, when he does talk about the ambulance chaser and how people will use these

1844
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,560
situations to promote their own agendas, I will say, yes, I agree with him on that.

1845
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:56,920
Weren't we just talking about politicians and the whole Supreme Court thing earlier?

1846
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:02,420
I mean, wasn't that all kind of promoting Leland Yee's own political agenda and continuing

1847
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,520
to promote his own?

1848
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:10,860
I mean, that part, I am with him and a certain Lord Voldemort wouldn't have done this in

1849
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:12,160
the past at all.

1850
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:20,960
Well, and that's really, again, I think a failing of society in general that and OK,

1851
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:28,940
I think that if you look at things maybe a hundred years ago or look into another culture,

1852
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:34,220
people will were more likely to own up to what was their mistake.

1853
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:39,440
It was considered the mature thing, the honorable thing to do, to own up to your own mistake,

1854
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:47,880
to put the blame where it was to not make those who were circumstantially a part of

1855
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:50,120
it, pay for it.

1856
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:56,280
But those who are specifically responsible for it instead, now we have this, oh, well,

1857
01:35:56,280 --> 01:36:01,240
you're so outraged and yeah, OK, the person who did it is in jail, but we want to blame

1858
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,300
it on something else because we want more punishment.

1859
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,760
We want a little bit more drama out of this.

1860
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,540
It's drama whoring is what it is.

1861
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:09,600
People want more drama.

1862
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,960
And really, it should be.

1863
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:15,800
X person was criminally insane.

1864
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,600
I don't care what they did.

1865
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:25,240
I don't care if they played My Little Pony, you know, while wearing mantis and and doing

1866
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,000
ballet in a little pink, really, too, too.

1867
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,280
I don't care.

1868
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,280
I do not care.

1869
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,080
I don't care that J. Edgar Hoover was a transvestite.

1870
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,080
He was a bastard.

1871
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:35,800
Him being a transvestite had nothing to do with being a bastard.

1872
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,760
All those things, by the way, that she mentioned before are able to be done in Dead Rising

1873
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,760
2 off the record.

1874
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:43,760
Yes, that is true.

1875
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:50,960
Capcom has your your weird, sick, twisted, I'm sorry, but the word Capcom is still a

1876
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:54,080
I have a bad Pavlov's response to that word this week.

1877
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:59,320
But my my point being is that whatever they did in their private life, whatever they do

1878
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:06,840
on the side has nothing to do with their final action.

1879
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:10,640
It may have been, OK, well, I've done all this and it's led up to this point.

1880
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:13,520
But really, it's what goes on in the head.

1881
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:19,200
If they're not right in the head, they're not going to do something right to begin with.

1882
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:24,660
If they're crazy, OK, yeah, maybe they'll get some pleasure out of playing a video game

1883
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:28,760
for a little while, but they're going to need something else a little bit later.

1884
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:34,800
It's just a bump on, you know, a ripple in the ocean, if that makes sense.

1885
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,880
It's a little pebble in the pond on the way to the big boulder falling in and damming

1886
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:39,880
the whole thing.

1887
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,020
Does that make sense?

1888
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:48,240
It does, but I'm just this whole thing is just I just irritates me.

1889
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,940
I'm just sick of the blame game.

1890
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:53,800
That's a big problem with society.

1891
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:59,880
People need to freakin grow up and also have the maturity to put the blame on who it needs

1892
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:02,880
to be put on, which is the person who did it.

1893
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,320
It doesn't matter what else they're into.

1894
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:10,640
You know, they could be into like latex fetish porn.

1895
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:13,880
He could have been a concert trained piano player.

1896
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:17,720
OK, like, OK, the guy in Japan who was the cannibal.

1897
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:20,680
Oh, I'm using him as example.

1898
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:24,560
He was a cultured, respected person.

1899
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:31,040
He was smart, lived a very good life, but he ate some chick that he went out on dinner

1900
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,040
with.

1901
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:35,320
He just gave into the temptation of flesh, which, by the way, now he's actually a paid

1902
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:36,320
lecturer.

1903
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,320
Just letting you know.

1904
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:43,320
Ah, and I hear he's eating it up all the attention, but my point is fired.

1905
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:44,320
OK.

1906
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,320
All right.

1907
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:49,160
So here's another here's another example, and I'm not just saying this because I'm Jewish.

1908
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,160
Hitler.

1909
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:53,880
Oh, God, failed painter.

1910
01:38:53,880 --> 01:39:01,160
He failed his entrance into a prestigious art school, so he joined the military.

1911
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,200
He was a vegetarian.

1912
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:10,680
You would not assume vegetarian and painter would lead to mass murderer, but it did.

1913
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:15,160
Are you going to blame all vegetarians and painters now for being potential mass murdering

1914
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:16,160
fuckheads?

1915
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:17,160
Well, vegetarians, maybe.

1916
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,160
I'm kidding.

1917
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,160
I'm kidding.

1918
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,160
I'm kidding.

1919
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:24,920
A little pita is just psycho anyway, but no, Jamie, you really murdered that onion in your

1920
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:25,920
salad.

1921
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:33,640
But but my point is, but my point is, you know, it doesn't matter what their hobbies

1922
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:34,640
are.

1923
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:36,800
It doesn't matter the walk of life they come from.

1924
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:37,800
Crazy is fucking crazy.

1925
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,440
And you blame the person.

1926
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,160
You don't see anybody blaming vegetarians for, you know, one hundred thousand people

1927
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:44,160
being killed.

1928
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:46,200
You don't see anyone blaming Hitler.

1929
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:49,760
Legend of Zaku in our chat room says, Jamie, you have to accept that playing the blame

1930
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:54,320
game ever since the Salem witch trials and you see what happened then.

1931
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,320
A bunch of innocent people died.

1932
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,000
You think we'd learn from history?

1933
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,580
No, because people are stupid.

1934
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:01,040
There may have been some witches in there.

1935
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,040
We don't know.

1936
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,480
All right.

1937
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,480
Enough.

1938
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,480
Enough.

1939
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,740
On that note, Loki has effectively killed the conversation.

1940
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:11,580
So let's change things up a bit.

1941
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:16,920
I need some happy goddammit.

1942
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:21,080
Every week here on the show, Dark Soccer takes a trip down memory lane and visits a classic

1943
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,080
video game.

1944
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,920
She says, hey, you need to be playing this game.

1945
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:25,920
What?

1946
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,080
I do have to repeat what William said.

1947
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,080
All right.

1948
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:31,160
The fallacy of correlation equals causation.

1949
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:34,680
Now, can we do the classic game?

1950
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:35,680
Yes.

1951
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:37,360
Dark Soccer wins the classic game of the week.

1952
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,360
StarTropics.

1953
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:42,600
At least you picked a really good classic game of the week.

1954
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:45,120
You know, I actually didn't really play that game all that much.

1955
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,120
Really?

1956
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:47,120
Yeah.

1957
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:52,440
But it's such a cool, but I remember playing it and enjoying it when I did, I just got

1958
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:53,440
lazy.

1959
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,600
My best friend in fourth grade and I stayed up all night playing this game.

1960
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,280
But it's a lot of people's favorite games.

1961
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:00,600
So it's like, why shouldn't I bring up StarTropics, right?

1962
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:01,600
Right.

1963
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,480
So it was an action adventure RPG.

1964
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:09,520
It came out by Nintendo in 1990 for the NES, and it was never released or intended to be

1965
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,520
released in Japan.

1966
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:14,840
It only came out in North America and Europe, but it was designed by Japanese designers

1967
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:20,860
who lived in the U.S., written and directed by Genyo Takeda of Nintendo Integrated Research

1968
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:23,740
and Development, who also gave us Punch-Out!

1969
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:29,320
And it came out on the North American Virtual Console on January 7th, 2008, and on the PAL

1970
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:31,640
region on January 11th.

1971
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:35,280
And of course I had a sequel, which was Zoda's Revenge, StarTropics 2, in 1994.

1972
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,840
That was the year I, not telling people what I did.

1973
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:43,040
So you start off as, I graduated high school.

1974
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:49,280
Mike Jones is visiting his uncle, who is named Dr. J and he lives on Sea Island.

1975
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:53,960
And he finds that Dr. J has gone missing and Babu, his assistant, who also sounds a lot

1976
01:41:53,960 --> 01:42:01,520
like Baloo from the Jungle Book, lets Mike use the submarine to basically go look for

1977
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:08,680
Dr. J. So it starts off all of his adventures, he thinks aliens are involved, and basically

1978
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:14,560
he finds Dr. J by the wreckage of an alien escape pod.

1979
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:21,400
So they think it's the Argonians, so he has to go to another ship and do all this stuff.

1980
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,400
And then Zoda comes!

1981
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:26,440
And I'm not going to say any more, because there's more stuff to the game than just what

1982
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:27,440
I'm saying.

1983
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,440
And there's also children adoption involved too.

1984
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:31,800
I just thought I'd mention that.

1985
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:33,800
But you don't adopt the children.

1986
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,560
No, you don't adopt children.

1987
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:40,600
So basically it's a 2D top down perspective, kind of like Zelda in the dungeon areas.

1988
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:48,760
But it is linear, consistent storyline, and the story progresses basically with talking

1989
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:51,360
to NPCs and doing certain actions.

1990
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:55,120
And then you have to, you know, go to your little dungeon-y areas.

1991
01:42:55,120 --> 01:43:04,640
So it switches mechanics there where it has a zoomed in type of perspective.

1992
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:11,520
So basically you get weapons and items, baseball themed in many cases.

1993
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:17,080
And you basically, well you also get baseballs but they're called wonder horse hides.

1994
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:25,200
And cleats known as spikes and bullas and shuriken and slingshots and mirrors and different

1995
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,200
types of stuff.

1996
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,600
But basically you get all kinds of things that help you progress through the game and

1997
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,560
fight all of the various baddies.

1998
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:38,000
So you get a life meter of 22 hearts, kind of like Link.

1999
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,600
In fact it looks a lot like, you know, the Legend of Zelda life bar.

2000
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:46,520
And you can find big hearts that are again like the heart containers in Zelda.

2001
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:50,440
And you can get vitamin X that fills up all of your hearts.

2002
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:56,480
Even though, you know, you will lose of course help when you take damage.

2003
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:03,640
So you can also get try your luck signs that are, you know, basically can give you extra

2004
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:04,640
lives in the game.

2005
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,840
You only start off with three.

2006
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:10,600
And if you lose all of your lives at the beginning of a dungeon, I mean in a dungeon then you'll

2007
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:13,600
have to go back to the beginning.

2008
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,640
So basically you've got, you know, your boss characters.

2009
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:18,200
It's RPG stuff.

2010
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:25,640
So it's, you know, like I said, I didn't get to play a whole bunch of it, but I know a

2011
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:26,640
lot of people liked it.

2012
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:30,360
We got to talk about the letter that came with the game.

2013
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:31,360
Yes, yes.

2014
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,440
There was a letter.

2015
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:36,560
My friend, we had no idea that this was, Oh my God, it was the coolest fucking thing when

2016
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,520
you were like nine or 10.

2017
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:44,840
You get a parchment letter and actually not, not, not any, like it actually came with the

2018
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:47,960
box, like just, you know, it's not, she's not talking about like something you get in

2019
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:48,960
the game.

2020
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,320
It was a tangible thing that came in the box.

2021
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,320
Made of parchment.

2022
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:53,320
Yes.

2023
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:56,760
And basically it has a letter from Dr. Jones addressed to Mike.

2024
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:02,740
And I, by the way, I actually did have a copy of the letter because when I rented Star Tropics

2025
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:08,360
back in the day, they included the letter with the rental and I kept it.

2026
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:15,400
Um, but basically, um, it's like you intercepted the letter and we're being, uh, invited to

2027
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:18,720
play the game on Mike's behalf.

2028
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:23,800
And then, um, you get a message from your uncle, evil aliens from a distant planet tell

2029
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:26,160
Mike to dip my letter in water.

2030
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:35,600
So if you have the letter, the original letter, then you could, um, put, um, what was that

2031
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,600
thing with the water?

2032
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,600
That had the secret message?

2033
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:38,600
Yeah.

2034
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:39,600
The letter you, whatever.

2035
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:40,600
Yeah.

2036
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,600
Subcode in it.

2037
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,600
Yeah.

2038
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,600
And I think it was supposed to be able to do it without damaging the letter.

2039
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:45,600
Yeah.

2040
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:46,600
Oh yeah.

2041
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:47,600
You could do it without damaging the letter.

2042
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:48,600
Yeah.

2043
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:49,600
But, um, but you had a secret message in there.

2044
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:54,320
I think it had like, I, if I remember right, there was a spot, a very specific spot where

2045
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,680
you would drip the water.

2046
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:57,680
I can't totally recall.

2047
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:58,680
Actually.

2048
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:00,280
I'm going to see if I can find a picture of the letter.

2049
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:07,280
I remember the code was seven 47 and is they actually like an airplane, Nintendo power

2050
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:13,360
or was asked the question enough because people that rented the game or sometimes their letter

2051
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,220
would be damaged or missing in the package.

2052
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:19,040
So Nintendo power actually printed it after a while.

2053
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,040
Yeah.

2054
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,320
I had the call into the hotline because I bought it used.

2055
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:23,320
Yeah.

2056
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:26,440
It's kind of one of those things that like in retrospect, it probably wasn't a very good

2057
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:27,440
idea.

2058
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:31,840
Like Ubisoft don't pay attention to the letter thing.

2059
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:36,880
Can you imagine that coming back as did as rights, uh, copyright protection.

2060
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:41,000
Remember back in the day on the, uh, sorry, Jamie, but on the PC games, like the old school

2061
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,820
PC games, we'd have to like thumb to page 26 of the manual and read the symbol that's

2062
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:48,400
on there or get the plastic card that came with the game.

2063
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,240
And I'm going to go all this insane copy protection back in the day.

2064
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:55,200
That's kind of what this sounds like, but that one was cool.

2065
01:46:55,200 --> 01:47:02,760
Well now, um, for virtual console, the letter is included in the digital manual and it has

2066
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,080
an image of the letter and a bucket of water at the bottom.

2067
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:10,200
So you click on the image and the letter dips into the bucket and the code shows up.

2068
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:14,720
Um, on the European release though, it just has a click here, link at the bottom and the

2069
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,720
thing will pop up.

2070
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:19,280
But I think it's kind of neat that, you know, you dunk the virtual letter.

2071
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,280
It's cute.

2072
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:21,280
It's cute.

2073
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:22,280
Yeah.

2074
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:23,280
I'm going to see if I can find a copy of it.

2075
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:24,280
I'll link it in the chat room.

2076
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:25,280
But yeah.

2077
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,800
I was surprised they haven't remade that series yet.

2078
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:30,000
I'm kind of surprised too.

2079
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,620
Like they did have a sequel to star tropics.

2080
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:33,320
I know like it was like soda's revenge.

2081
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:34,320
Wasn't soda's revenge.

2082
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:39,560
Wasn't the last NES game they made or no, that was, it was right at the end though.

2083
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:45,040
I think Wario's woods was technically the last NES game they ever made, but Zoda's revenge

2084
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,040
was right at the end.

2085
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:47,040
All right.

2086
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:48,040
We've got the letter.

2087
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:49,040
Nice.

2088
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,040
Oh, that's a bad image.

2089
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:53,400
Um, there we go.

2090
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:56,920
And I am going to, um, put a link to that in the chat room.

2091
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:57,920
Yeah.

2092
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:58,920
It'd be fun.

2093
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:02,480
If anyone wants to see, it's actually, and I love the name of the website, socks make

2094
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,440
people sexy.net slash put on tumbler.

2095
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:06,440
Put on the tumbler.

2096
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:07,440
Okay.

2097
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,440
But I'm just gonna say it to you.

2098
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:09,440
Okay.

2099
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,160
images slash star tropics underscore letter dot JPEG.

2100
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:12,160
Good.

2101
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,160
Check it out.

2102
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:19,600
This guy looks like a Rob, the robot, by the way, this navcom guy in the, uh, little ship

2103
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:22,640
that you navigate just so you know, it's just like a Rob the robot.

2104
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:23,640
All right.

2105
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:24,640
Anyhow, there it is.

2106
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:26,720
Your classic game of the week star tropics.

2107
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:27,720
One of my favorites too.

2108
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:29,840
Good, good, good call dark Sakura.

2109
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:33,600
Even though that wasn't one that maybe you remember as fondly, that was, that was a classic

2110
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:34,600
game for the rest of us.

2111
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:38,160
There are a few games I haven't played or haven't played a whole lot of, but that doesn't

2112
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:41,160
mean that other people haven't, you know, played them.

2113
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,160
There you go.

2114
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:45,720
So, all right, we're going to take a quick break guys, but when we come back, there is

2115
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:49,520
plenty more of orange launch radio to come, including some rapid fire news.

2116
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,240
Uh, the FUs of the week in the mail back, of course, your Twitter topics is twitter.com

2117
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,240
slash O L R.

2118
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:56,040
And of course more phone calls.

2119
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:05,680
When we get back with more of orange lounge radio.

2120
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:08,240
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.

2121
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:15,120
We are live of course, with our 422nd episode on this July the 31st of 2011.

2122
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:17,840
All right, we're into part B of the show.

2123
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:21,560
We're going to start off part B as we always do with some rapid fire news.

2124
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:23,760
So Loki, start us off with some rapid fire news.

2125
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:24,760
Ah, yes.

2126
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:26,600
Um, lots of fun stuff.

2127
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:31,480
Let's talk a little bit about rock band and of course, um, they hit a major milestone

2128
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:32,480
this week.

2129
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:37,920
3000 tracks now on their service, both combined in the regular rock band store and of course

2130
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,280
the rock band network stuff.

2131
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:49,640
Um, and to celebrate this, harmonix is actually hooking up, uh, 30 people, um, in America,

2132
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:55,280
um, with a hundred songs of their choosing either on Xbox or PS3.

2133
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:58,000
And of course then, you know, it's 3000 songs.

2134
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:04,440
There's different ways to enter, um, via Twitter, Facebook or the rock band forums.

2135
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:09,720
And um, yeah, hopefully someone out there is going to enjoy those hundred songs if you

2136
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:10,720
win.

2137
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:18,320
Um, of course, as of us recording this, it ended about a few days ago, so, uh, so much

2138
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,320
for that.

2139
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,120
And then snooze, you lose.

2140
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:27,280
I forgot to enter to, uh, of course, uh, you know, you don't win the hundred songs.

2141
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:31,640
There are some other things coming out this week including, um, and these are all individual

2142
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:32,640
songs.

2143
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:33,640
They don't have any packs this week.

2144
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,960
Uh, make some noise by the beastie boys.

2145
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:37,440
That's going to be two bucks.

2146
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:38,680
No sleep to Brooklyn.

2147
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:44,840
Um, also two bucks and that's also from the beastie boys, um, brought a barracuda by heart.

2148
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:47,400
Uh, that's two bucks.

2149
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:48,980
That's pretty awesome.

2150
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:52,360
Super bad parts one and two by James Brown.

2151
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:54,140
That's also two bucks.

2152
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:58,420
And tell me something good by Rufus featuring Chaka Khan.

2153
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:00,040
That's also two bucks.

2154
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:06,440
And you can get some pro bass and pro guitar expansions for a barracuda and super bad parts

2155
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:08,280
one and two.

2156
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:09,280
Not time for that yet.

2157
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,280
Sorry.

2158
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:13,360
Uh, yes.

2159
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:18,480
It's funny because Duke Nukem still thinks it's popular, but Duke Nukem Forever is going

2160
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:23,500
to be getting some new, uh, download content, new multiplayer modes and maps.

2161
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:30,440
This fall, um, they're going to have a Hail to the Icons parody pack and it's going to

2162
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:40,680
have several parodies of, um, different games including, um, they've got a parody of Team

2163
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:43,920
Fortress 2, um, that's going to be in there.

2164
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:51,360
Uh, two forts one bridge that's going to include hats and, you know, it says Duke doesn't need

2165
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,360
no stinking hats.

2166
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:56,520
Give him a minigun and he'll beat off all, um, corners.

2167
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:57,720
He'll beat off?

2168
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:58,720
Or all comers.

2169
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,720
Okay.

2170
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:00,720
Um, okay.

2171
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,800
Um, inferno time machine engage.

2172
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:10,560
Uh, Duke does combat in a hellish landscape of lava and teleporters who turn on the 16

2173
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:11,680
bit graphics.

2174
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:14,800
More importantly, where did this DFG come from?

2175
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:19,960
Ha ha ha, you're parodying Doom, a game that's how old?

2176
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:24,920
Oh, as old as your last game, because that's how long it took to get it out.

2177
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:25,920
Ha ha ha.

2178
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:31,160
Uh, sand pit, player's sake, roll of mini Duke in a giant sandbox with two bases on

2179
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:33,360
either end made of child's toys.

2180
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:36,360
This map features sticky grenades and Call of Duke.

2181
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:40,080
Gee, I wonder what game that is parodying.

2182
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:43,520
Duke engages in modern combat in a war-torn city.

2183
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,160
Foes don't stand a chance against Duke when he spams them back with the noob tube.

2184
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:55,920
Okay, and they're also gonna have freeze tag, which I guess is gonna be, um, players will

2185
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,720
be able to freeze and shatter their opponents in huge succession for points and combos.

2186
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:01,720
That's gonna be the new mode.

2187
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:05,240
You know what the funny part about it, about all this?

2188
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:08,480
All those games that you're parodying, way better than your own game.

2189
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:12,200
Ha ha ha, joke's on you, dumbass.

2190
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:15,480
So that'll be coming, if you bought Duke Nukem.

2191
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:20,080
Hey, you know what, by the time that all this download content comes out, I bet you the

2192
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:25,840
download content will be priced higher than the actual game, because it already got price

2193
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:26,840
dropped, by the way.

2194
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:27,840
Did it really?

2195
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,560
$3,999 happened this week.

2196
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:30,560
Wow.

2197
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,560
Yeah.

2198
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:32,560
That's a good sign.

2199
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:36,480
You know, when you drop something really quick, that means it's selling well, right?

2200
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:37,480
Right?

2201
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:38,480
Yeah.

2202
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:50,280
Um, and, yeah, ha ha ha, Operation Rainfall apparently is still not working out too well.

2203
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:54,160
Xenoblade Chronicles is not coming out over here.

2204
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:59,400
Of course, you know, this week, Nintendo released their upcoming software list, and Xenoblade

2205
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:02,080
Chronicles, nowhere near to be found.

2206
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:06,440
It is still scheduled for release in Europe, however, on August 19th, and of course, you

2207
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:13,200
know, the game has been subject to ongoing campaigns by disgruntled American RPG fans,

2208
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:16,560
and um, they're kinda pissed off that it's still not coming out over here.

2209
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:20,640
Seen as it's being localized into languages that, you know, us Americans speak, so you

2210
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:23,800
would think it'd be easy to publish it.

2211
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:24,800
But Nintendo doesn't care.

2212
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:29,360
Why don't they just put it on their downloadable serv- ohhhh, that's right, they don't really

2213
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:31,400
have anything like that, yeah.

2214
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:34,800
I mean, they have the Wii store, but- I don't know if you saw it, they announced this week

2215
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:38,680
that guess what, they're gonna now start offering download content on the 3DS.

2216
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:40,080
I heard about that, yeah.

2217
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:43,640
That's like, wow, way to the party.

2218
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:45,720
Well, I mean, didn't the Wii do that too?

2219
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:49,960
I mean, the Wii had Rock Band, and you could download some stuff on there, so I don't think

2220
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:54,960
it's exactly earth-shattering to hear that Nintendo's supporting DLC, it's really just

2221
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:55,960
a matter of when.

2222
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:58,840
But it's just not coming out yet, I mean, it's like they haven't built the infrastructure

2223
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:00,080
into the 3DS.

2224
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,640
There's no games worth it yet.

2225
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:03,680
Wait.

2226
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:08,880
Now what would be interesting is Nintendo saying, we are getting on board with that.

2227
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,240
That would truly be something new.

2228
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:12,200
That would be like Bizarro World.

2229
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:15,920
Now that is something- Mario Kart with new downloadable tracks?

2230
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:16,920
Exactly.

2231
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,080
That is the story to wait for.

2232
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:19,720
Is that what Nintendo's talking about?

2233
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:22,040
Because then that's news.

2234
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:24,080
Anyhow.

2235
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:25,680
Moving on to some other news.

2236
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:29,600
Street Fighter X Tekken is obviously on everybody's radar, especially if you're into fighting

2237
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:30,600
games.

2238
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:35,920
Fans of the characters, Dan, that might be Dark Sakura, she's a fan of Dan.

2239
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:40,040
If you're a fan of Dan or a fan of Anna from Tekken, you might be disappointed.

2240
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:44,720
Both of them have been announced as not in the roster, in fact they were booted out of

2241
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:45,720
the game.

2242
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:50,880
The series producer Yoshinori Ono has said that those characters won't be in Street Fighter

2243
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:57,480
X Tekken because he was killed by a Tekken character at Comic-Con last year.

2244
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:04,480
But I think the real reason is, quote, as much as I personally wanted to have a cool

2245
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:09,120
Nina and Anna tag battle, the director was against putting Anna because we already had

2246
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:10,120
Nina in.

2247
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:13,760
Now, of course, Dan probably isn't gone for real real.

2248
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:19,160
I would, at this point, knowing Capcom, wait for Street Fighter X Tekken Super or whatever.

2249
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:24,600
Honestly, I think Anna's gonna be a palette swap for Nina.

2250
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:26,360
Which is what she's been in other games.

2251
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:29,840
Anna kind of played differently though, I loved Anna because she had her big heels and

2252
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,160
everything, it was kind of fun.

2253
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:33,200
Nina had the heels going on too, she had the big boots.

2254
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:34,720
I know, it was just different with Anna.

2255
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:35,720
It's hard to explain.

2256
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:39,480
Well, Anna had the dress and was super girly with the short hair.

2257
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:42,160
Yes, fun to play.

2258
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,760
My old boss kind of looked like Anna.

2259
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:44,760
Oh well, anyway.

2260
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:50,440
There you go, so those characters will not be in Street Fighter X Tekken, sadly.

2261
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:54,480
Some soundtrack related news, quite a bit of it actually, there's a write in music collection

2262
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,700
that's due out on September 28th.

2263
01:56:56,700 --> 01:57:00,480
It's Team Entertainment is the record label, a four-disc compilation of music from the

2264
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:03,680
write in series called The Lightning Strikes Back.

2265
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:08,760
It will have music from write in the arcade from the 90s, write in 2, write in DX, write

2266
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:12,960
in DX PlayStation, write in 3, and write in 4.

2267
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:15,180
Coming out September 28th in Japan.

2268
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:21,840
Also in soundtrack news, The King of Fighters XIII, the pre-orders will come with 15 years

2269
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:25,840
of musical history, a four CD soundtrack compilation.

2270
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:27,760
That's what Atlas is putting out there.

2271
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:30,880
Try and get folks to pre-order The King of Fighters XIII.

2272
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,640
That's pretty cool, actually.

2273
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:37,200
There's also supposed to be some exclusive game modes in the console version of the game.

2274
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:42,280
A story mode that will have new visuals and animations, a practice mode, a tutorial mode,

2275
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:45,500
and other stuff that wasn't in the arcade but you would expect to see in a console release

2276
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:46,680
of a fighter.

2277
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:53,680
One other soundtrack news, Rhythm Heaven on the Wii is getting a four-disc soundtrack.

2278
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:59,000
It's already out in Japan, Rhythm Heaven Wii, but it's coming out here as well.

2279
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,160
So there you go.

2280
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:09,200
A four-disc CD soundtrack coming out in Japan, August 24th for 4,800 yen, 150 songs.

2281
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:11,520
Perfect in extended tracks included.

2282
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:16,580
Lastly, on the plate tonight, not in soundtrack news but in sequel rumor news, TimeSplitters

2283
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:19,880
4 rumored that there is a version of that coming.

2284
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:24,840
I guess this is because of the official PlayStation Magazine UK's rumor machine section.

2285
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:28,880
There's a rumor that says, quote, Gun-wielding monkeys are finally making a comeback.

2286
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:31,680
A fourth TimeSplitters title is to be announced soon.

2287
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:36,560
Of course, it is coming from the rumors, but when you consider it's the official PlayStation

2288
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:37,560
Magazine.

2289
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:38,560
I love me some TimeSplitters.

2290
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:39,560
I know.

2291
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:40,560
I bet you're excited about that.

2292
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:41,560
So, we will see.

2293
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:42,560
Are you giddy?

2294
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:47,160
Uh, not until they actually announce something, because they've been talking new TimeSplitters

2295
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:48,640
for a long time now.

2296
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:52,520
All right, let's go to Dark Sakura.

2297
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,860
In other news, we have the Endermen.

2298
01:58:54,860 --> 01:58:55,860
They're coming for you.

2299
01:58:55,860 --> 01:59:01,240
They're actually a new Minecraft mob, and they're just little black stick figures with

2300
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:02,240
white eyes.

2301
01:59:02,240 --> 01:59:03,240
Like everything in Minecraft.

2302
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:06,120
You know, but they're all black.

2303
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:11,320
They actually remind me of, okay, do you ever remember in Mario Galaxy where there were

2304
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:16,280
the little black guys that were standing on top of the world but you couldn't get to them

2305
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:18,280
and they would just watch you?

2306
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:21,200
That's what they look like to me.

2307
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:23,760
And they're just there to be scary.

2308
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:25,480
They're there to terrify you.

2309
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:29,700
So that's all they're there for, and they're going to be in the next Minecraft update.

2310
01:59:29,700 --> 01:59:36,840
It's based off of, I guess, a character that was made on the Something Awful forums, Slenderman.

2311
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:43,840
I watched, they have this ARG, it's called Marvel something, I forget what it's called.

2312
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:46,880
And really creepy.

2313
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:50,000
Really, really creepy.

2314
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,200
The Slenderman's also been thrown in a number of other video games too, just in background

2315
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:56,200
stuff.

2316
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,200
Very creepy.

2317
01:59:57,200 --> 02:00:01,960
They'll basically stand still moving blocks around stuff, but if you move your reticle

2318
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:08,160
over them, they'll stare at you and then they'll charge at you.

2319
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:12,880
They can teleport and kill you.

2320
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:17,160
I'm actually going to get a picture in the chatroom so they can see what it looks like.

2321
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:18,720
There you go.

2322
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:23,160
So moving forward, we also have something from Disney.

2323
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:31,380
They want to buy UTV Ignition for $454 million.

2324
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:37,080
Their base, this actually comes from develop, and it says Disney already owns 50.4% of UTV

2325
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:42,040
and they're wanting to acquire the whole thing for its Bollywood films and TV shows.

2326
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:47,000
So who knows, but they own Ignition, so that means there might be some issues.

2327
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:52,880
And last but never least, and related to Disney a bit, Toy Story download content is coming

2328
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,740
for LittleBigPlanet 2.

2329
02:00:54,740 --> 02:01:03,360
There will be, actually it's going to be on August 3rd in the UK, that's going to be £4.79

2330
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:11,440
or €5.99, and that's nine Toy Story themed levels with two cut scenes, five levels and

2331
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:17,880
two mini levels, two new music tracks, one new interactive music track, one new level

2332
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:22,320
background, five materials, ten decorations, six objects, and 149 stickers.

2333
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,320
That's pretty rad.

2334
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:28,920
The costume pack, which is going to cost the same, has Buzz Lightyear gloves, helmet, legs,

2335
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,520
teeth, and body.

2336
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:37,880
Then there's Slinky Dog set, which has the feet, ears, hands, nose, skin, body, and tail.

2337
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:43,720
There's Ham, which is a head, skin, and body, and Rex, which is the claws, head, skin, and

2338
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:44,960
body.

2339
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:53,240
And then you can also, though, download each set individually for £1.59 or €1.99.

2340
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:56,600
Alright, I still got to get LittleBigPlanet 2.

2341
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:58,120
I don't know why I keep missing the boat on that one.

2342
02:01:58,120 --> 02:02:01,680
I guess I keep waiting for a price cut that doesn't seem to be coming, but hopefully there'll

2343
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:05,520
be like a Game of the Year edition or something this holiday like there was the first time.

2344
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,520
So we'll see.

2345
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:10,720
Anyhow, before I get back into some more news, I want to mention a couple things real quick,

2346
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:13,360
kind of a second wave of housekeeping, if you will.

2347
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:17,240
First off, if you enjoy Orange Lawns Radio, do check out another show that we produce

2348
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:18,240
here.

2349
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:21,360
It's called The Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth at www.hoardhouse.com.

2350
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:25,800
It's myself and my buddy Xtfer, and this week we had special guest Ferrari, one of the guild

2351
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:30,960
leaders for Xtfer's Guild, on Talking Smack About WoW, some really good Firelands and

2352
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,160
raiding discussion this week.

2353
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:35,240
So if you're a fan of WoW, check that out again, hoardhouse.com.

2354
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:36,320
One more day.

2355
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:37,320
What's one more day?

2356
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:39,040
Oh, you get your last Firelands vendor, right?

2357
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:40,040
I know.

2358
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:41,040
You know you get a new mount from that.

2359
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:42,040
I know!

2360
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:43,040
You get like a little firebird thing.

2361
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,040
I know!

2362
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:45,040
SlaciousPop got that the other day.

2363
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:46,040
I know, I know, I know, I know.

2364
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:47,040
It's cute.

2365
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:48,280
You'll be getting to ride a flaming bird.

2366
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:49,280
I know.

2367
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,280
Alright.

2368
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:56,080
Also, the third podcast is probably delayed a little bit considering there's some personal

2369
02:02:56,080 --> 02:03:01,240
stuff going on and so forth, but we are still eyeing that at least by Labor Day, no later

2370
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:02,240
than that.

2371
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:04,960
We've already got things definitely in motion.

2372
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:07,200
Yeah, so more hints coming.

2373
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:10,660
Some of you have been begging me on Twitter for more information about that, so all I

2374
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:15,800
will say is that, you know, certain components of this show, if you like it, you're gonna

2375
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:18,120
really like the new show.

2376
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:21,560
Otherwise, oh well, you still got this show.

2377
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:23,560
It's all free, so don't complain.

2378
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:24,560
Alright.

2379
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:25,560
The other thing...

2380
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:26,560
And they might learn a thing or two.

2381
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:27,560
That's right.

2382
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:28,560
You might.

2383
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:34,000
Also, I want to say this, a new segment coming to OLR, actually.

2384
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,320
You know how we have like some segments we like to do on the show?

2385
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,760
Obviously, a lot of things you're very used to.

2386
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:42,640
The Twitter topics, the Skype line we do at the end of the show, Classic Game of the Week

2387
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:44,000
and so forth.

2388
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,960
We've kind of talked amongst ourselves, you know, we like to mix it up once in a while

2389
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:48,960
at OLR.

2390
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:52,360
While we have a formula that works for us, once in a while we want to mix it up.

2391
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:57,320
And one thing we want to feature more on the program is Indie Games.

2392
02:03:57,320 --> 02:03:59,520
So we're gonna have a new segment starting soon.

2393
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:00,640
I can't say exactly when.

2394
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:03,980
It just depends when I can get some folks on the show, but we're actually gonna spotlight

2395
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:04,980
Indie Games.

2396
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:09,000
We don't have a name for the segment yet, but we are gonna have, or I guess I should

2397
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,760
say, invite developers onto the show to talk about their passion, their game and, you know,

2398
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:17,040
share our space with the indie developers.

2399
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:21,660
We've had some on in the past in more full interview capacity, but we decided we wanted

2400
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:25,080
to have it be something that's a little more regular here on the show.

2401
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:29,040
After all, we are an independent podcast, so we should do more supportive Indie Games.

2402
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:32,280
You know, I like to think we give them a fair share and a fair shout out here on the show,

2403
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:36,080
but I like to regularly feature something on the show, especially with so much that

2404
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:40,660
you can drown in on Xbox Live, Indie Arcade and the fact that they don't really do anything

2405
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:42,760
to call any of the notable releases to the top.

2406
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:47,640
I think it'd be really nice to have something to at least call out one game you should be

2407
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:48,760
checking out a week.

2408
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:51,760
I want to point out, it won't just be limited to Xbox.

2409
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:57,720
We're considering PC, Homebrew, as well as the iOS and iPhone and really Android and

2410
02:04:57,720 --> 02:04:59,200
indie type of phone games.

2411
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:03,080
Pretty much any system that's easily accessible will cover it.

2412
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:07,340
Hell, if somebody who's developing a new Dreamcast game wants to come on the show, I am all for

2413
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:10,640
that, and I'm sure Dark Sakura's all over that too, because the fangirl she is.

2414
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:15,400
So if you are a developer that wants to have your Indie Game featured on the show, I would

2415
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:19,720
like to keep it to relatively new releases, but in the beginning I won't be too picky.

2416
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:23,680
But something that's been out in the past few months or so, do drop me an email.

2417
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:29,240
You can email me personally, rob at orangeloungeradio.com, or you can always drop the general email bag

2418
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:30,240
as well.

2419
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:33,080
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com will get you in touch with who you need to get in touch

2420
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:34,080
with.

2421
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,480
So that is coming to the show soon.

2422
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:38,640
Whenever we get enough stuff in the pipeline where we have some things to feature, we're

2423
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:40,400
going to spotlight that here in the show.

2424
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:41,600
I'm excited.

2425
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:44,880
Just think about it like the classic game of the week, but now it's going to be the

2426
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:45,880
Indie game of the week.

2427
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:46,880
The new classics.

2428
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:51,080
I guess you can think about it that way, and it won't just be Dark Sakura telling you about

2429
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:53,840
it, we want to have a discussion with the developer.

2430
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:57,140
Although if a week goes by where maybe we're having a hard time getting somebody, we'll

2431
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:59,080
talk about something that caught our eye.

2432
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:03,440
Speaking of iOS, I want to talk about that real quick, and some of the iPhone games.

2433
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:06,680
Because there's some really good stuff going on on the iPhone right now, like Groove Coaster.

2434
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:07,680
Right?

2435
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:08,680
Amazing.

2436
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:09,680
We all agree.

2437
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:10,680
We all agree.

2438
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:11,680
I love Tiny Tower.

2439
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:12,680
Okay, look.

2440
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:13,680
Do you see this, Rob?

2441
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:14,680
What?

2442
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:15,680
You're downloading it now?

2443
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:16,680
I will download Tiny Tower.

2444
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:17,680
Here's the thing.

2445
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:18,680
Tiny Tower.

2446
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:19,680
Oh my God.

2447
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:20,680
I should hate it.

2448
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:23,760
It's no better than a Facebook game, but it's so adorable, and all the characters are little

2449
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,520
8-bit characters, and they look so cute, and they have their little bit books that they

2450
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:28,520
update.

2451
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:29,520
And you know what I really love about-

2452
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:30,520
There's one called Tiny Zoo.

2453
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:32,800
You know what I love about Tiny Tower?

2454
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:35,120
Let me tell you this about Tiny Tower.

2455
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:42,080
What I love about it is that, yes, it's free-to-play, and they have these whole tower bucks things,

2456
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:46,800
and if you want to buy the tower bucks, you can do that and move the game a lot faster.

2457
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,880
But you don't have to, because once in a while, and more so than in most free-to-play games,

2458
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:55,960
you'll get tipped a tower buck, or you'll get tower bucks as little incentive rewards.

2459
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:58,800
And so it helps to move the game along a little bit.

2460
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:02,960
And what I also love about it is that if you forget to check your tower for three weeks,

2461
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:06,680
oh well, the lights were dark for three weeks, and you didn't make any money.

2462
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:08,520
Your citizens don't move out.

2463
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,960
They don't burn the building down in protest.

2464
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:14,960
It's just, it doesn't require your tender love and care all the time.

2465
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:16,360
So if you want to play it every day, you can.

2466
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:18,360
If you want to play it once a week, you can.

2467
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:23,320
That is good design, in my opinion, and where the freemium model should go.

2468
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:26,040
And I do know people that have spent money on Tiny Tower.

2469
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:30,140
I wouldn't, but I think if people want to, they can.

2470
02:07:30,140 --> 02:07:31,140
So there you go.

2471
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:35,320
So, all right, so I'm looking at our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchy.com, and it does look

2472
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:41,060
like some folks in chat are excited about the whole indie games, talking about that

2473
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:42,160
segment coming up.

2474
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:46,960
And Act Deaf there says, woo, new OLR segment.

2475
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:51,280
Break Man in chat says, how will any of you ever have the time to actually play games

2476
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:53,040
talking about the third podcast?

2477
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:54,040
I will say this much.

2478
02:07:54,040 --> 02:07:55,040
Hey, I'm not working.

2479
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:56,040
I am.

2480
02:07:56,040 --> 02:08:00,000
And yeah, adding a third podcast to the plate is going to be something.

2481
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,960
It's not going to be a long show, and it's going to be something where we can record

2482
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:07,720
several of them in a day, and produce it regularly.

2483
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:08,720
I'm not going to lie.

2484
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:10,080
That's the way it's going to be done.

2485
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:12,080
But I think you guys will get a kick out of it.

2486
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:15,160
It is going to be myself, DarkSakura, and Dan.

2487
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:18,680
Loki is, of course, always welcome whenever he wants to come on, but he's got other stuff

2488
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:19,800
he's got to do, too.

2489
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:22,560
And Dan, of course, is going to add a whole new element, especially when we tell you more

2490
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:24,360
about what it's about.

2491
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:29,480
It'll be great.

2492
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:30,480
Let's see.

2493
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:31,480
Let's see.

2494
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:34,240
Breakman in the chat says, Xbox Live Indie Games.

2495
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:36,040
Those devs need to call OLR.

2496
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:37,040
I agree.

2497
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:40,120
So, please, again, get in touch with me, Rob at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

2498
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:43,160
Who wants to be first?

2499
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:44,160
And let's see.

2500
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:47,280
Misty about Tiny Tower in chat says, hey, protest burning might be funny.

2501
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,280
Once anyway, at least.

2502
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:51,840
I do agree it would be nice to see them do a little more with some of the events and

2503
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:55,840
so forth, but the game is still early in its life, and I'm sure there'll be update patches

2504
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:56,840
and so forth.

2505
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:58,560
Now, that's iOS gaming done well.

2506
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:03,560
I'm going to tell you what iOS game blows, absolutely blows.

2507
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:05,360
Capcom Arcade.

2508
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:06,440
You check this out?

2509
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:14,120
Capcom Arcade, you can play classic Capcom Arcade games like 1942 and, I don't know,

2510
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:18,860
what else is in the, Ghosts and Goblins and Street Fighter and all that.

2511
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:24,080
You can play those, and the deal is you can play like three games once for free.

2512
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:28,320
You get like three tokens every day for free, but if you want more tokens, you have to pay

2513
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:32,280
more, or you can buy a machine permanently for like three bucks, but it controls like

2514
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:33,280
shit.

2515
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:37,320
And I'll tell you what, Magic Sword came out this week, and I love Magic Sword.

2516
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:41,160
That's like the best, like, Capcom 90s game for me.

2517
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:42,600
I loved Magic Sword.

2518
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:46,760
Yes, I love the one on Xbox and PlayStation Network, by the way, the whole remake, but

2519
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:50,960
I love me some Magic Sword, and I was so excited when it came out to the phone that I played

2520
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:51,960
it.

2521
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:53,360
It controls like shit.

2522
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:59,480
I cannot use, like, I hate the emulation of a thumb stick with the, it just doesn't work,

2523
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:03,480
and then the game froze up on me halfway through the first stage, completely froze up on me,

2524
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:07,160
and I was like, the music kept going, so I knew that the emulation was still running,

2525
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:12,440
but the game itself just froze, and I was like, did anybody fucking test this, or did

2526
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:15,880
they just decide to just put this shit out and see who'd buy it, because it seemed to

2527
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:21,240
me like option B. So, yet another strike from Capcom this week.

2528
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:24,280
That Capcom arcade needs to be tested better.

2529
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:26,280
It sucks.

2530
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:28,280
Anyhow.

2531
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:31,000
So there you go, that's my iOS talk.

2532
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,280
Let's get back into some other news.

2533
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:36,600
So we'll do some long news with Loki.

2534
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:37,600
Yes.

2535
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:44,720
You know, and since we were, we were talking a little bit about Capcom, and they made an

2536
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:50,200
errant judgment, if you will, back with Resident Evil Mercenaries, where they said, hey, you

2537
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:55,280
know what, we're gonna make it impossible for you to erase your game's save, and everybody

2538
02:10:55,280 --> 02:11:00,040
was pissed, and hopefully we figured that maybe people learned by that, you know, that

2539
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:01,040
lesson.

2540
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:03,320
Well, no.

2541
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:09,360
Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions from Namco also features a problem where your save files are

2542
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:12,800
permanent and unable to be reset or erased.

2543
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:20,640
Of course, they put this out, and you know, there's, you know, according to Game Life

2544
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:26,080
blog, Wired's Game Life blog, there's simply no way to erase a save once it's been written

2545
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:27,080
to the cartridge.

2546
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:30,640
I've looked all over, even going as far as to ask a Namco Bandai representative, and

2547
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:33,720
it doesn't seem like there's a way to erase a save game.

2548
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:39,280
And you know, basically saying that the design doesn't just affect earned in-game awards,

2549
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:43,800
which can't be deleted, but also high scores, meaning that the most recent high score is

2550
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:48,840
the only one that the game records.

2551
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:55,080
Apparently though, Namco, they have come to an explanation for it, and they're saying

2552
02:11:55,080 --> 02:12:01,200
that, here's how it works.

2553
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:08,720
Pac-Man Tilt, it says the plus high score from the EX level one, it says it needs to

2554
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:14,440
open 10 mils, let me really see what the high scores are here.

2555
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:19,400
Score ranking, keeps one of each of the top scores mentioned above to submit to online

2556
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:25,040
ranking boards, keeps the gamer's name in which the player can input via on-screen keyboard.

2557
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:33,040
Yeah, it doesn't really say why they did that, it just shows how it's affected.

2558
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:38,080
It says they confirmed that players have the option to share high scores online, but using

2559
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:44,300
the same cartridge in different DS main posts to score twice, Namco Bandai didn't comment

2560
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:48,520
on the decision-making process behind it.

2561
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:53,920
Sounds like no decision was made, it sounds like just bad design again.

2562
02:12:53,920 --> 02:13:02,040
Yeah, other than, but if they were to copy Capcom's response, it would say that it was

2563
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:10,280
an attempt to preserve the game's arcade style feel, and it would never do it again.

2564
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:16,880
Here's my thing, the 3DS, okay, you've got very little penetration for the 3DS out there

2565
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:26,000
right now, do you really need to hinder sales of any game on that system, and Pac-Man and

2566
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,280
Galaga Dimensions, I don't know about you, but that's not really at the top of my list

2567
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:32,120
of games I would want for the 3DS.

2568
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:34,840
Well, they're great on Xbox Live Arcade, and it sounds like that's where they're going

2569
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:37,080
to remain great, you know?

2570
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:41,480
Yeah, but it's just like, really, you thought that was a good idea.

2571
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:47,220
The thing that concerns me here, I mean, another, and I would say, I might have been interested

2572
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:50,640
in these games if the price was right, but again, this whole save file thing, I can't

2573
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:55,760
support this, and I don't, like, the excuse they're giving just fucking doesn't make sense.

2574
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:57,840
They didn't really talk in us in circles.

2575
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,320
No, they didn't really have an excuse.

2576
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:01,000
There is, they gave no excuse.

2577
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:08,080
This concerns me, because we have two companies that have made the same mistake that's very

2578
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:12,680
fishy, and that's the whole used game market, right?

2579
02:14:12,680 --> 02:14:17,800
So it's, it's really fishy to me that we have two companies that have now done this.

2580
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:19,800
You do understand people, like, I, I don't...

2581
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:20,800
Is this a trend?

2582
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:26,280
This isn't, this isn't gonna stop you, I mean, yeah, it will stop used game sales.

2583
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:29,080
You know how it's gonna stop used game sales, or at least hinder it?

2584
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:33,040
Because people, exactly, because people aren't gonna buy the new game, because if you're

2585
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:38,440
gonna buy a game, which, you know, games stop me, decide, hey, you know what, we're not

2586
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:41,680
gonna take it back because you can't erase this save game, granted, they haven't made

2587
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:46,120
the decision permanently so far, they did at one time with Resident Evil, where they

2588
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:50,180
said, oh, we're not gonna take it back, and then they changed that, but, you know, if,

2589
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:55,480
if they do this, then, you know, a consumer that realizes, you know what, I'm gonna play

2590
02:14:55,480 --> 02:14:59,320
this game for a while, then I'm probably gonna get sick of it, and I'm gonna sell it, and

2591
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:04,520
get some money for something else, if they can't sell it back, they may not buy it.

2592
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:08,200
They're, you know what, I'll just, I'll just skip buying, and I'll, I'll wait until another

2593
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:10,160
game comes out.

2594
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:17,560
It's just, it's dumb, it's really a dumb idea, and it's, and why you should be limited, why

2595
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:22,840
even at all games should be saved to the carts that they're on instead of your system.

2596
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:28,480
Your 3DS, which has a goddamn SD card in it, every one comes with one.

2597
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:31,880
Yeah, it's not even something you have to buy separately, like on most DSPs.

2598
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:38,040
And you can save to that, I don't understand why you can't do that, and that's stupid.

2599
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:43,220
You know, with the DS it made sense, because there was, there was no saving whatsoever

2600
02:15:43,220 --> 02:15:50,100
to the system, there was no storage of any sort whatsoever, but this is the 3DS.

2601
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:56,520
Come on, jump into the century where, you know what, we can store data to these carts.

2602
02:15:56,520 --> 02:16:01,960
I mean, it's not like Namco could have heard what Capcom did and then made the decision.

2603
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:06,640
Both of these companies made this conscious decision to design the saves this way months

2604
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:09,520
ago, and that is weird to me.

2605
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:12,880
It's almost like somebody put them up to it.

2606
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:15,480
That's what strikes me as, like, just really weird.

2607
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:17,800
But anyway, I hope this trend stops.

2608
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:22,360
And yet again, another game, but this one, unlike the Capcom game, this was one I was

2609
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:26,720
legitimately like, oh, I really do love Pac-Man Championship Edition, I wouldn't mind a portable

2610
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:29,680
version of it, you know, if it was like 1999 maybe.

2611
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:34,720
But now, nope, not gonna do it, because I'm not gonna support this type of game design.

2612
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:40,040
So, even though I do tend to buy most of my games new, and I don't sell a lot of them

2613
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:41,800
back, very rarely do I sell games back.

2614
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:46,760
The last game I remember distinctly selling back was Top Spin 3.

2615
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:52,800
And just a handful of, like, GameCube and old first generation Xbox 360 games.

2616
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:53,800
So.

2617
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:58,920
Anyhow, more news about the Xbox 360 anyway, since I brought it up there.

2618
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:04,440
Free-to-play games apparently are inevitable on the Xbox 360, at least according to one

2619
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:05,440
publisher.

2620
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:11,080
Todd Harris of Hi-Rez Studios, who makes the game Tribes Ascend, it's a multiplayer first

2621
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:15,680
person shooter coming to the PC, and hopefully someday the 360.

2622
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:19,640
Todd Harris says, quote, at least from our conversations, both Sony and Microsoft are

2623
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:23,320
moving there strategically, but there are still some things to be worked out on both

2624
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:29,400
the business side and the technical side of the certification side, that's a tongue twister,

2625
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:31,880
regarding frequency of patches.

2626
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:35,680
And those issues just need further advancement before we would be comfortable putting a release

2627
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:37,580
timeframe on the console version.

2628
02:17:37,580 --> 02:17:41,560
It's not the case of never, but we know all those things we can handle on the PC, so that's

2629
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:43,120
why PC is first.

2630
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:44,120
Interesting.

2631
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:47,280
I remember hearing something about this, doesn't Microsoft limit you to the number of patches

2632
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:49,440
you're able to do within the release?

2633
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:51,680
I think so, I think you have to pay for that or something.

2634
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:59,040
And maybe that's why the free-to-play games, well hell, any MMO tends to do a lot of frequent

2635
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:03,160
updates, maybe that's the reservation they're having, which makes a lot of sense now.

2636
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:08,040
To me, it's nice to kind of hear what the holdup is, and that makes sense now.

2637
02:18:08,040 --> 02:18:13,000
Although, shit, Final Fantasy XI, man, that game ended up being the exception to every

2638
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:18,600
damn rule, because that game can patch whenever they want, because it runs through play online.

2639
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:20,480
I found a copy at the thrift store today.

2640
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:21,480
Did you really?

2641
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:24,600
Like, the three release one.

2642
02:18:24,600 --> 02:18:27,120
Well, that's kind of dumb, because the code isn't going to work.

2643
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:29,120
I know, but I thought it was funny.

2644
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:30,400
Yeah, it is kind of funny.

2645
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:31,400
And Half-Life 2.

2646
02:18:31,400 --> 02:18:33,480
That poor thrift store didn't know any better.

2647
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:34,480
Yeah.

2648
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:36,360
If someone's going to buy it and not know any better.

2649
02:18:36,360 --> 02:18:38,280
I know, that's the sad part.

2650
02:18:38,280 --> 02:18:42,880
Alright, and Brakeman comments in our chatroom at chat.orns.com, Xbox has already had

2651
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:45,760
free-to-play games, 1 versus 100.

2652
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:46,760
Too bad it didn't last.

2653
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:47,760
Good point.

2654
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:52,760
1 versus 100 wasn't an MMO, per se, but it was a free-to-play game, sure, it was Microsoft

2655
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:57,580
backed, for one, but everybody, well, at least a lot of people I know miss it dearly.

2656
02:18:57,580 --> 02:18:59,280
It's not a freemium game, though.

2657
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:00,280
True.

2658
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:04,400
But you know, though, that Marvel's MMO is going to be free-to-play.

2659
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:05,400
That's right, I remember hearing that.

2660
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:06,400
With Deadpool.

2661
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:07,400
But it's not going to be on 360.

2662
02:19:07,400 --> 02:19:08,400
No.

2663
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:09,400
It's going to be a PC game.

2664
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:10,400
Yeah, but still.

2665
02:19:10,400 --> 02:19:11,400
Yeah.

2666
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:13,880
So, let's go to the mailbag.

2667
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:19,200
Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read your emails.

2668
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:20,200
Live here on air.

2669
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:24,920
Actually, I've got to say this, live, this is really funny, just live, we had a little

2670
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:30,640
net split live, and if you've ever been on IRC, you know what a net split is, and I guess

2671
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:35,380
Loki's on one side of the net split and I'm on another, because I could see that Loki

2672
02:19:35,380 --> 02:19:37,720
just left the room.

2673
02:19:37,720 --> 02:19:39,960
It's me on an island with Black Wolf and Dark Tetsuya.

2674
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:41,520
Oh, and everybody's back.

2675
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:42,520
Oh, just reconnected.

2676
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:43,520
There you go.

2677
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:44,520
That's kind of funny.

2678
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:45,520
All right.

2679
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:46,520
Oh, internets.

2680
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:47,520
You never cease to amaze me.

2681
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:48,520
All right, let's move on.

2682
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:49,520
Mailbag.

2683
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:50,520
Open shop time.

2684
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:51,520
Oh.

2685
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:52,520
Oh yeah, mailbag that thing.

2686
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:53,520
Well, we got two.

2687
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:54,520
I'm going to double check and see if we got any more, real quick.

2688
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:55,520
Nope, just two.

2689
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:56,520
So, the first one.

2690
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:57,520
Hey, guys.

2691
02:19:57,520 --> 02:19:58,520
Hey.

2692
02:19:58,520 --> 02:19:59,520
Just wondering, do you know of any smaller Xbox controllers?

2693
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:00,520
The current ones are so big, and the way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons

2694
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:01,520
are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way the

2695
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:23,200
buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the

2696
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:31,260
way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way

2697
02:20:31,260 --> 02:20:35,820
have to probably get a third-party controller and I think most of those are pretty soon.

2698
02:20:35,820 --> 02:20:40,700
Or a joystick. You could try one of those game pads like they put some out for Street Fighter 4,

2699
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:45,340
the little game pads that came out, but I know Salacious Pop had a lot of problems with those.

2700
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:51,660
Like he got one, he ordered it brand new out of the bag, broken. What about like, I mean,

2701
02:20:51,660 --> 02:20:55,740
I know she might be thinking smaller, but what about thinking bigger? Like what about an arcade

2702
02:20:55,740 --> 02:21:01,660
stick? That's what my suggestion was. I have, I've had hand surgery twice on my right hand, so it

2703
02:21:01,660 --> 02:21:05,900
gets really stiff really easily and my fingers will lock up because I still need to have one

2704
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:13,180
other finger worked on. But, um, like for example, I can play Dragon Age 2 just fine because I use

2705
02:21:13,180 --> 02:21:16,540
my thumb and forefinger for a lot of stuff and neither of those are ones that have problems,

2706
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:21,500
but I cannot play fighting games very well because I'm moving so fast and my hand will

2707
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:27,340
start cramping up. So what I found is that using the joystick, you know, like we have the tournament

2708
02:21:27,340 --> 02:21:33,260
stick and we've got the Xbox joystick, which you can probably find at a used game store somewhere

2709
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:41,340
for cheap. Um, I have no problem. So something like that will work. A situation like that is

2710
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:45,180
tough too, because you really need to get your, no pun intended, you need to get your hands on

2711
02:21:45,180 --> 02:21:49,420
a controller to actually try it before you buy it. So I would really suggest you head out to

2712
02:21:49,420 --> 02:21:54,140
something where they tend to have those things out for you to try, like maybe Best Buy. Uh, I know

2713
02:21:54,140 --> 02:21:58,220
Fry's, but they're more west coast. Fry's always seems to have that kind of stuff out, at least the

2714
02:21:58,220 --> 02:22:02,460
arcade sticks, but I know they don't have those everywhere. Um, hopefully there's a store near

2715
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:06,300
you. Maybe even an independent store might be a way to go where they would have some of that stuff

2716
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:11,500
out for you to try it and see how your hand takes to that. By the way, speaking of the controllers

2717
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:16,700
they have out at Fry's, they have a six button PlayStation controller that's not, it's, it's

2718
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:23,900
third party but supported by PlayStation, by Sony that's super comfortable. So I mean, maybe see how

2719
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:29,500
that likes it and see if the same distributor makes another pad like it, because I found that

2720
02:22:29,500 --> 02:22:34,140
to be really comfortable and it was just a six button fighting stick. I was playing, um, Super

2721
02:22:34,140 --> 02:22:40,860
Street Fighter IV with it at Fry's. Interesting. Yeah. So that was that email. And then the last

2722
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:48,060
one, just two quick unrelated questions. Um, first off, is there an online multiplayer game that

2723
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:55,180
varies the audio of voice chat or availability of text chat based on proximity? A character closer

2724
02:22:55,180 --> 02:23:00,620
to you would sound louder while players across the map couldn't be heard at all. I haven't gotten my

2725
02:23:00,620 --> 02:23:04,460
feet wet with it, but I suggest World of Warcraft would do something like this. Actually it does.

2726
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:08,860
It does not, and the voice chat that's built into WoW kind of has a reputation for sucking.

2727
02:23:08,860 --> 02:23:12,780
They tried to build it so that people wouldn't have to get what's called ventrilo servers or

2728
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:18,220
TeamSpeak some people use. Um, but folks tend to rely on the ventrilo servers. With characters

2729
02:23:18,220 --> 02:23:25,980
though? Actually your proximity does change with in-game, with NPCs. Yeah. But if your sound

2730
02:23:25,980 --> 02:23:29,980
drivers will support it. Right. But not other people. I think he's thinking like a person to

2731
02:23:29,980 --> 02:23:33,660
person game. You know what game comes to mind for me, to me for some reason is Halo. Didn't

2732
02:23:33,660 --> 02:23:39,740
Halo do that? Or specifically Halo 2 and 3 character. He's not saying, Oh, he said a

2733
02:23:39,740 --> 02:23:47,740
character. Yeah. Wow. Does that then? Yeah. Wow. Does that, um, wow. We'll also pan left to right,

2734
02:23:47,740 --> 02:23:58,860
depending on your sound card. Yeah. Um, I know that area noises in portal two and also the

2735
02:23:58,860 --> 02:24:04,140
loudspeaker in portal two based on where you are. The, um, the loudspeaker will project a

2736
02:24:04,140 --> 02:24:07,820
different way depending on the texture of the walls and where you are. Do you remember that?

2737
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:16,300
So the echo will be different. Um, yeah. And when you're talking to, I don't care spoilers,

2738
02:24:16,300 --> 02:24:22,060
it's been out already. When you're talking to potatoes through the glass wall, um, she's a

2739
02:24:22,060 --> 02:24:26,780
little quieter than when you're actually right in front of her. So a lot more games are doing that,

2740
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:30,620
but really a lot of it also has to do with your, with your sound card and, you know,

2741
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:35,260
playing stereo versus mono. So, and then the second question real quick tiger call on our

2742
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:39,420
chairman says they still use ventrilo ventrilo harassment comes to mind. Yeah. I've seen those

2743
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:45,100
YouTube's interesting for the record on Star Trek online, which by the way also does the distance

2744
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:52,300
based. Um, I use team speak and do any of that. It's just like ventrilo. Yeah. They're just

2745
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:56,620
competing clients, but yeah. Oh yeah. Ventrilo is used by a lot of wow people. A lot of guilds

2746
02:24:56,620 --> 02:25:03,740
use ventrilo. It's really common. Any MMO with a big guild that does any type of group events,

2747
02:25:03,740 --> 02:25:08,540
you're going to find something like ventrilo team speak. One of those clients. I actually host a

2748
02:25:08,540 --> 02:25:12,700
ventrilo server for my private guild of friends for the record. I do prefer ventrilo versus team

2749
02:25:12,700 --> 02:25:19,820
speak. Me too. After having used them both. And I used team speak since February when I was playing,

2750
02:25:19,820 --> 02:25:24,620
um, February last year when I was playing Star Trek online. Okay. The second question, secondly,

2751
02:25:24,620 --> 02:25:31,340
assuming Jamie is on tonight's show, what tense is used in phrases such as will have happened?

2752
02:25:31,340 --> 02:25:37,980
And I do believe that is future perfect. Will have happened. When you're referring to anything

2753
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:46,140
that will, that is a future event happening, but in that future point where it has already happened,

2754
02:25:46,140 --> 02:25:51,980
it's future perfect. Really? I thought we were a video game show. He asked. Fair enough. Um,

2755
02:25:51,980 --> 02:25:58,780
and that's from Robert M. Add it for the emails then. Yeah. If you want to get in on the email

2756
02:25:58,780 --> 02:26:04,140
bag, mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com. But now's the part of the show where we could rant

2757
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:14,700
about lack of emails. If we would like. See you at the week.

2758
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:26,380
Um, you know, I did have one at the beginning of the show and now for the life of me,

2759
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:33,340
I can't remember what it is. So fuck you do not remember. You know, the memory is the first thing

2760
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:46,300
you know. Hey Rob, what Loki, um, fuck you. The whole foods being too damn expensive.

2761
02:26:47,020 --> 02:26:51,500
Go to sunflower instead, all the same stuff and it's cheaper. There's some big cheese wheels that

2762
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:59,500
I really wanted to buy. They're probably like $300. I like me my parm. Um, I don't really have

2763
02:26:59,500 --> 02:27:04,300
a whole lot of FUs. Things are, these are pretty good. Otherwise, um, FU to weekends not being

2764
02:27:04,300 --> 02:27:08,940
three days long. I'll do something a little silly like that. That's it for the FUs of the week.

2765
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:14,380
Let's get back into some news. Loki. I'm not able to say that FU.

2766
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:22,140
I get a three day weekend this weekend. Anyways, uh, let's talk. Let's talk about some more,

2767
02:27:22,140 --> 02:27:30,140
more, more, uh, retarded DRM. And you know, I'm saying that because it's Ubisoft and Ubisoft,

2768
02:27:30,140 --> 02:27:35,740
you would have thought, learned their lesson with, uh, the always on, uh, DRM that they had

2769
02:27:35,740 --> 02:27:41,820
with Assassin's Creed and stuff, but no, they're back with the always on Assassin's Creed type DRM

2770
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:49,580
for Driver San Francisco. Um, yes, the PC version will require a permanent internet connection and,

2771
02:27:49,580 --> 02:27:56,700
um, no word if that's going to be loosened or not like it was with Assassin's Creed. Um, or I

2772
02:27:56,700 --> 02:28:01,900
believe Prince of Persia was the other game that used that. Um, of course the console version has

2773
02:28:01,900 --> 02:28:07,500
the stupid Uplay Passport now, the one time use code that will unlock multiplayer access. Thank

2774
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:14,140
you Ubisoft. I get to play unlock or I get to play some multiplayer. How generous of you. Also

2775
02:28:14,140 --> 02:28:21,900
from dust is getting the Ubisoft DRM as well. Thanks Ubisoft. And, um, that kind of sucks.

2776
02:28:22,860 --> 02:28:29,900
Then, um, to kind of add a little bit of the icing on top of their stupid cake. Um,

2777
02:28:30,620 --> 02:28:37,420
they have come out, they have come out and said that, guess what? Our always on DRM is a success.

2778
02:28:37,420 --> 02:28:45,180
And it's a success and pissing everyone off. Yay. Basically it says, uh, Ubisoft has seen the clear

2779
02:28:45,180 --> 02:28:51,180
reduction in piracy of our titles, which required a persistent online connection. And, uh, from that

2780
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:56,780
point of view, uh, the requirement is a success. That's because everyone went further underground

2781
02:28:56,780 --> 02:29:01,260
to get around your DRM. I mean, they really think that people aren't going to find a way around it

2782
02:29:01,260 --> 02:29:08,700
again. Here's the thing is, I don't know what exactly is considered a success because, yes,

2783
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:14,620
less people are pirating your game, but you know what? The number of people pirating your game

2784
02:29:15,580 --> 02:29:19,900
before versus the number of people pirating your game now that you say it's reduced,

2785
02:29:19,900 --> 02:29:25,180
does that actually equal out to more sales? Because that those two numbers are independent

2786
02:29:25,180 --> 02:29:29,580
of each other. They have nothing to do with it. You know, whether people are interested in

2787
02:29:29,580 --> 02:29:34,780
downloading your game or not, you know, um, someone may not have been interested in downloading

2788
02:29:34,780 --> 02:29:40,460
Assassin's Creed 2 on PC or Splinter Cell Conviction on PC. Maybe they just didn't want

2789
02:29:40,460 --> 02:29:48,540
to pirate the game. You ever think of that? Um, and not to mention though that, uh, the previous

2790
02:29:48,540 --> 02:29:58,140
games, you know, the DRM was hacked within a few weeks anyways. So I wouldn't exactly go out and

2791
02:29:58,140 --> 02:30:04,540
shout at the top, you know, your lungs that it's a, you know, great success because all you're

2792
02:30:04,540 --> 02:30:08,700
really doing is affecting the people that legitimately buy the game and now they want to

2793
02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:13,180
play it offline or something like that, you know, play it in an area. Say you take your laptop with

2794
02:30:13,180 --> 02:30:17,660
you and you want to play it at, you know, a friend's house or something and you don't have open

2795
02:30:17,660 --> 02:30:22,940
wi-fi. Or say you're a serviceman overseas serving our country and you want to play a game to relax

2796
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:32,700
on your break, you know. Can't do it. Can't do it. Thanks Ubisoft. So, yeah, it's stupid and...

2797
02:30:32,700 --> 02:30:37,020
How is that a success? That's offensive. The only people that this hurts is the people who

2798
02:30:37,020 --> 02:30:41,900
bought the game legitimately. That's who this hurts. Pirates will still get their game and

2799
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:48,140
you're an idiot if you don't think they won't. I mean, because the PSP is unhackable, right?

2800
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:55,580
Yeah. And, you know, I remember when they... It did get, you know, cracked almost, you know,

2801
02:30:55,580 --> 02:31:02,540
pretty quickly. So, here's the thing. If you're using, and I'm gonna assume it's the same scheme

2802
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:10,380
as before, it's gonna be cracked even faster. So, all that's... Who's gonna win in that? The pirates.

2803
02:31:10,380 --> 02:31:15,100
Because they don't have your crappy DRM anymore. What's this about? They denied the rumored cracks?

2804
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:21,820
Oh, this was back in March. They had, of course, their new DRM and I want to say it was for...

2805
02:31:21,820 --> 02:31:27,020
I'm trying to remember which game it was. It wasn't... Maybe it was Assassin's Creed 2, but there was

2806
02:31:27,020 --> 02:31:35,820
another game that they had coming out as well. I guess they... It says, pirated copies of various PC

2807
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:40,220
games from Ubisoft are apparently making the rounds online, sparking allegations that the DRM

2808
02:31:40,220 --> 02:31:45,900
has already been defeated. And, of course, Ubisoft spokesman reported to Edge, saying this rumor is

2809
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:52,620
false and while pirated version may seem to be complete at startup, any gamer who downloads and

2810
02:31:52,620 --> 02:31:57,820
plays the cracked version will find that the version is not complete. Yeah, not complete in the

2811
02:31:57,820 --> 02:32:02,060
fact that you don't get... I don't know what it was that they didn't get access to, but it was

2812
02:32:02,060 --> 02:32:06,700
something really stupid. Like, oh, you don't get... You don't get access to our wonderful customer

2813
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:13,100
service. You don't get the Uplay features. Hooray. Yeah, something like download content or something

2814
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:17,900
like that. Yeah, oh no, I can't download download content through your service. I guess I'll have to

2815
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:26,140
pirate that too. It'll be cracked. You watch. Because people love, especially now that they've

2816
02:32:26,140 --> 02:32:32,860
come out and said, oh, it was a success. Whoosh! You just thrown gasoline on the fire, you dumbass.

2817
02:32:32,860 --> 02:32:40,220
Alright, well, speaking of adding fuel to the fire, there's obviously a lot of pissed off people

2818
02:32:40,220 --> 02:32:47,020
that Mega Man Legends 3 got cancelled. What does the internet love? Petitions! So, an activist group

2819
02:32:47,020 --> 02:32:52,780
has called themselves 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3. They're trying to get

2820
02:32:52,780 --> 02:32:58,940
100,000 members and they are trying to get them all on their Facebook page. So, you can go over

2821
02:32:58,940 --> 02:33:04,220
there and like them if you are so inclined. Not exactly. They are doing that, but there's

2822
02:33:05,180 --> 02:33:10,460
an actual official petition which you have to do is sign up for the Dev Room stuff for the Mega Man

2823
02:33:10,460 --> 02:33:15,740
Legends 3 project and you sign up there and then you go to the forums and you make a comment and

2824
02:33:15,740 --> 02:33:19,420
a thread. Well, it also wouldn't surprise me if people are just trying to reach out however they

2825
02:33:19,420 --> 02:33:25,020
can. Yeah, it's basically that's how they're doing it right now. I signed up for it and did all that

2826
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:30,140
stuff just because, you know, I'd like to play Mega Man Legends 3 and, you know, I'm not going to

2827
02:33:31,180 --> 02:33:35,420
beg them to release it, but I'll support the movement, I guess. Well, right now they're up

2828
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:42,380
to 36,428. So, they're about a third of the way there. So, we'll see what happens. So, I mean,

2829
02:33:42,380 --> 02:33:47,340
no word on what happens when they hit 100,000. I mean, Capcom hasn't said. Capcom will go,

2830
02:33:47,340 --> 02:33:53,580
thanks for your support. Capcom will say, wow, that's 100,000 people that aren't getting this

2831
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:59,500
game still. That's 100,000 people that we should market another upcoming game to. You know you

2832
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:04,140
want to play Dead Rising 2. One of the things that, you know, was on there for their little

2833
02:34:04,140 --> 02:34:09,980
catchphrase was Legends Never Die or something like that. And so, Capcom, they had some DLC or

2834
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:14,940
whatever for costumes for like Marvel versus Capcom 3, which, by the way, doesn't have any

2835
02:34:14,940 --> 02:34:21,180
Mega Man in it at all. I mean, Tron Bon, right? Well, but that's not Mega Man. Tron Bon's in

2836
02:34:21,180 --> 02:34:26,460
there. So, we love the Mega Man Legends series, but there's no Mega Man characters at all. So,

2837
02:34:26,460 --> 02:34:30,140
they put in there, you know, oh, there's alternate DLC because Legends Never Die,

2838
02:34:30,140 --> 02:34:32,220
and neither does like fashion or something like that. It's like...

2839
02:34:34,380 --> 02:34:37,660
I know that's literally Capcom giving the finger to that group.

2840
02:34:40,380 --> 02:34:46,300
Oh, God. It was like, oh, I gotta find the Facebook thing now. You know it was some intern

2841
02:34:46,300 --> 02:34:51,740
that wrote the little text there, and they were trying to get around the man that's holding them

2842
02:34:51,740 --> 02:34:56,780
down there, the management, and try to throw him a support, but it just comes off the wrong way.

2843
02:34:56,780 --> 02:35:01,420
Oh, I really need to find that quote because it was high-larious.

2844
02:35:01,420 --> 02:35:05,180
High-larious. Well, while you find that, let's go to Dark Sakura. I think he has some more

2845
02:35:05,180 --> 02:35:09,500
high-larious stuff for us. By the way, the Skype line is coming up as well as your Twitter topics

2846
02:35:09,500 --> 02:35:17,740
in just a little bit. Oh, oh, oh. This is... It's kind of... You know how people are always

2847
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:22,620
finding little Easter eggs in games much later after the games have been out? You know, sort of

2848
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:33,020
like the blowing on the Famicon speaker to make the Pulse voice disappear and all that? Apparently,

2849
02:35:33,020 --> 02:35:49,900
Bomberman will eat your dust and lick your crack. These were sound files... These were

2850
02:35:50,940 --> 02:35:56,540
sound files hidden in the 1997 game Atomic Bomberman, which was the first Bomberman

2851
02:35:56,540 --> 02:36:02,380
game made for Windows and the second Bomberman that came out on a home computer. But it has,

2852
02:36:02,380 --> 02:36:06,620
I'm so fucking proud of you, I could just shit. You should play that one. That one's great.

2853
02:36:08,460 --> 02:36:13,020
If I can find it. I am so fucking proud of you, I could just shit.

2854
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:23,340
And then there's like... Eat my dust and lick my crack. There's like, oh, my ass. And there's

2855
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:30,220
one that says, I'll slap you down and shit. That's right there, tits. The one after that

2856
02:36:30,220 --> 02:36:36,700
is a little funnier. You're fucked. No, I mean, there's like multiple sounds. That's right there,

2857
02:36:36,700 --> 02:36:43,180
sweet tits. That's right there, tits. That's right there, tits. You're talking to me, shit heel.

2858
02:36:45,580 --> 02:36:49,900
This would be a great soundboard for L.R. Talk to the fist because the face is pissed.

2859
02:36:51,500 --> 02:36:54,940
Next time Loki and I get in an argument about Nintendo, Dark Soccer could just say,

2860
02:36:54,940 --> 02:37:01,100
would you guys cut out this macho shit and hurry up? Yeah, don't make me come out there

2861
02:37:01,100 --> 02:37:09,420
and stomp both of your asses. I also like my ass is killing me, I need help. My ass is killing me,

2862
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:17,340
I need help. The one after that's funny too. That's really funny in like a second grade way.

2863
02:37:17,340 --> 02:37:22,300
Oh, fuck me.

2864
02:37:27,900 --> 02:37:29,980
Oh, fuck me.

2865
02:37:33,020 --> 02:37:35,340
They're going to put out Mega Man Legends 3 after all.

2866
02:37:38,780 --> 02:37:43,100
I will tell you something about this, though, is that you could actually go into the sound files

2867
02:37:43,100 --> 02:37:49,100
in the game and make your own vocal macros for the game. Nice. So I think, I mean, I don't see

2868
02:37:49,100 --> 02:37:54,140
why this is reported on now, except that, you know, I think it's fucking funny. Time for a

2869
02:37:54,140 --> 02:38:01,180
fucking dirt nap. Sounds kind of like Bugs Bunny saying that. That's kind of funny that they made

2870
02:38:01,180 --> 02:38:05,020
all these really sick things they were just never found, you know. I like the last one. You talking

2871
02:38:05,020 --> 02:38:14,540
to me, shit heel? You talking to me, shit heel? Oh, fuck me. I like, I'll break your fucking head

2872
02:38:14,540 --> 02:38:23,980
with a ratchet. That one's great too. Xenocorn chat says, sounds like the jerky boys did the

2873
02:38:23,980 --> 02:38:29,340
audio. Yeah, kind of. It's kind of what it sounds like. These are the, well, you know, another game

2874
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:33,420
had unused voice clips and I actually, I was reading a little bit more about this. It's not

2875
02:38:33,420 --> 02:38:39,020
a story that kind of has something, you know. Did you know in Portal 2, what's his name that did

2876
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:43,180
Cave Johnson? I can never remember his name. I know who he is, but I can never remember his name.

2877
02:38:43,180 --> 02:38:47,980
The guy from Spider-Man. Yeah. He would, he refused to do certain lines because it sounded

2878
02:38:47,980 --> 02:38:53,740
too much like a rape scene. Yeah, I read that this week. And I had posted something about it on my

2879
02:38:53,740 --> 02:39:01,420
Tumblr, but you can find Ellen's lines, who was the voice of GLaDOS and Carolyn saying, no, I

2880
02:39:01,420 --> 02:39:06,860
don't want this. You know, basically, but there was one line that I wish they would have recorded

2881
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:13,020
because I would love to hear it. It's after she gets put in GLaDOS says, I'm awake and I'm going

2882
02:39:13,020 --> 02:39:21,180
to kill you all. So. Okay. I found that actual, that quote, and it was from the DLC for Super

2883
02:39:21,180 --> 02:39:27,660
Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. It says, all alternate costumes for Guile, Blanca, Dalsim,

2884
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:32,940
Genn, and Feilong are included in this pack. Show everyone that legends never die and never go out

2885
02:39:32,940 --> 02:39:38,700
of fashion. And to which, you know, the hundred thousand strongs, uh, for bringing back, maybe

2886
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:45,740
a legendary ego. Seriously? Seriously? And the chat room is lighting up a minute and a half later

2887
02:39:45,740 --> 02:39:52,540
because of the buffer. JK Simmons is who you're trying to think of. Yes. All right. Insolacious

2888
02:39:52,540 --> 02:40:00,380
Pop says he's fucking hot. All right. Uh, moving on a couple more stories for you guys. And then

2889
02:40:00,380 --> 02:40:07,980
the Skype line at 1 877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. Yes. Sony soon

2890
02:40:07,980 --> 02:40:13,980
enough will be saying, show me on the doll where they touched you. Uh, cause they actually have

2891
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:20,780
patented some creepy looking doll thing. And I don't know if this was the crying baby out of the

2892
02:40:20,780 --> 02:40:27,420
PlayStation 3 commercials or what, but apparently the patent was filed back in 2008. Uh, it's only

2893
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:34,700
been, uh, recently been publicized. Um, it's a plush toy that's, um, packing, I guess like a

2894
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:40,540
wireless receiver, uh, means for reading storage medium and even a processor along with both USB

2895
02:40:40,540 --> 02:40:47,020
and ethernet ports. It would be act as some sort of buddy for kids who can pop a disc into their

2896
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:52,780
PS3 and have the console communicate with it, telling it to act surprised or its arms up or a

2897
02:40:52,780 --> 02:41:02,460
certain point, you know, certain points during gameplay or viewing or whatever. Um, weird and

2898
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:08,700
creepy looking. Wasn't there a controller like on the Wii for some type of game that was a doll and

2899
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:14,220
you put the Wii mode up its butt and yeah, there's two games. Yeah. Yes. That sounds like kind of

2900
02:41:14,220 --> 02:41:19,100
two games. Oh my. There's my baby. Well actually it was funny cause I think one evolved into the

2901
02:41:19,100 --> 02:41:26,700
other. There was, um, My Baby and Me. I think it was, uh, from 505 Games and that came out in

2902
02:41:26,700 --> 02:41:32,540
Europe. I don't know if that came out over here, but we got Babysitting Mama also developed by the

2903
02:41:32,540 --> 02:41:37,020
same studio that put out My Baby and Me. But the baby was actually cute, not disturbing looking

2904
02:41:37,020 --> 02:41:42,300
like that picture. Yeah. Well the, to be fair though, they did have a, it was a holster that

2905
02:41:42,300 --> 02:41:47,580
you could put on your baby so you could holster the remote that way instead of shoving it up its

2906
02:41:47,580 --> 02:41:53,020
ass. Um, this thing is kind of creepy, but I could see, you know, some interesting implementations

2907
02:41:53,020 --> 02:41:59,420
to that. Say you jailbreak your PS3. The PS3 can send a kill signal to the doll and stop

2908
02:42:00,300 --> 02:42:04,780
and they can attack you in your sleep. Play fun pranks on all your family.

2909
02:42:04,780 --> 02:42:11,740
I'm reminded that one Halloween episode of, uh, the Simpsons where it was like,

2910
02:42:11,740 --> 02:42:15,420
I'm Christie the clown and I'm going to kill you. It's a little dolly.

2911
02:42:18,060 --> 02:42:23,820
Uh, it is creepy though. Would you play a game that involved a doll as a peripheral Loki?

2912
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:29,500
Would it have to be murder dolls or something like that? I don't know. It would have to be fun.

2913
02:42:30,620 --> 02:42:34,140
All right, one more story for you guys and then we'll get to the Skype line. This is about

2914
02:42:34,140 --> 02:42:39,580
connectimals. Uh, guess what was announced? A sequel of sorts to connectimals. You can think

2915
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:45,900
of it as connectimals plus or more formally connectimals now with bears. Yes, that is

2916
02:42:45,900 --> 02:42:50,860
exactly the name of a connectimals now with bears. Uh, it's, I guess there's going to be

2917
02:42:50,860 --> 02:42:57,580
download content called bear Island and you'll be able to download this for $15. And, uh, well, no,

2918
02:42:57,580 --> 02:43:01,820
it's not those types of bears. Not like the kind that were at Folsom street fair, but I like those

2919
02:43:01,820 --> 02:43:06,220
bears. Well, these, well, I like Panda bears and that's the types of bears you're going to see in

2920
02:43:06,220 --> 02:43:12,620
this. Yeah. So there you go. Uh, I don't know. They say five different types of bears that are

2921
02:43:12,620 --> 02:43:17,420
going to be in it. Um, they do have some pictures. I don't, I saw a polar bear. I don't think,

2922
02:43:17,420 --> 02:43:23,820
is that a koala? Kinda. Let me see. Let me see. My favorite is the box art. Cause it just looks

2923
02:43:23,820 --> 02:43:29,340
like they totally just photoshopped in the little Panda there. Um, let's see. I'm trying to see if

2924
02:43:29,340 --> 02:43:34,380
we have any koalas. That's definitely a polar bear polar bear polar bears are in there. There's

2925
02:43:34,380 --> 02:43:39,820
a black bear and a Brown bear and I think a Brown bear climbing a tree. So I don't think they have

2926
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:46,460
koalas. No, you're thinking of the wrong game. I'd like to mention though, Jamie, I made that joke

2927
02:43:46,460 --> 02:43:53,980
about a month ago on my Twitter. What? Oh really? Oh, you, Oh, you made that joke a month ago and

2928
02:43:53,980 --> 02:43:58,780
now they just announced it officially. Interesting. How funny. Cause I put Microsoft is releasing

2929
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:02,220
connectables plus bears. So if I followed you on Twitter, I would have known about the bears.

2930
02:44:02,220 --> 02:44:08,460
I sure hope that the animal type of bear, not the big hairy gay kind, but you know what? I would

2931
02:44:08,460 --> 02:44:15,580
play that game too. Anyhow, you can download the download content for 15 bucks or there'll be a

2932
02:44:15,580 --> 02:44:22,540
new retail release called connectables now with bears. Grr. There you go. That does it for the

2933
02:44:22,540 --> 02:44:26,860
news tonight. We're going to go to the Skype line. It is open now at one eight seven seven

2934
02:44:26,860 --> 02:44:31,660
game O L R or our username on Skype is orange launch radio. You can call us right now and we

2935
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:35,580
will talk about whatever you want to talk about. Any news stories tonight or what have you.

2936
02:44:35,580 --> 02:44:40,940
Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, let's go to the Twitter and get some tweets to read here in

2937
02:44:40,940 --> 02:44:44,540
between the waiting for some phone calls. Another screen capture. I'm going to put it in the chat

2938
02:44:44,540 --> 02:44:51,260
room. God, what'd you find? Do I want to know? It's just, it's just a couple of bears. Oh yeah,

2939
02:44:51,260 --> 02:45:00,060
probably gay bears, right? Wearing assless chaps. Nice, but they have cute little ears.

2940
02:45:00,060 --> 02:45:03,900
Can I go to the Twitter while we wait for some calls again? One eight seven seven game O L R

2941
02:45:03,900 --> 02:45:08,380
your username on Skype is orange launch radio. 13 X forever tweets us. So what do you guys think

2942
02:45:08,380 --> 02:45:14,220
about the group coaster by Taito for iOS? Well, I guess we said at the top of the show, but a plus

2943
02:45:14,220 --> 02:45:20,060
well done, right? Dark Sakura. And hopefully you'll give it a try this week. I meant to

2944
02:45:20,060 --> 02:45:22,940
download it. I just haven't gotten a chance to. All right. We got a call coming in. Hi,

2945
02:45:22,940 --> 02:45:27,580
you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's CD thunder. Hey, what's up CD thunder.

2946
02:45:29,020 --> 02:45:32,060
Not much. I have a couple of things I want to discuss. All right. What?

2947
02:45:34,140 --> 02:45:38,940
The two newest games that are out Duke Nukem forever and LA noir. Yes. What about them?

2948
02:45:40,300 --> 02:45:43,100
Well, I like to start with the Duke Nukem forever. Please do.

2949
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:51,580
Well, first off, yeah, I agree with what you're saying that graphics aren't really that great.

2950
02:45:52,540 --> 02:46:01,900
And, um, but it's still, Duke still has his, um, sarcasm that's made it, that's made the games

2951
02:46:01,900 --> 02:46:08,060
great over the years. And, and only in this could, and only in this game could you kick a

2952
02:46:08,060 --> 02:46:13,260
monster's eyeball and consider it a field goal. So you kind of like the potty humor in it. I mean,

2953
02:46:13,260 --> 02:46:17,820
there's no shame in that potty humor is funny once in a while. There you go.

2954
02:46:19,580 --> 02:46:25,500
I mean, but what about, uh, what's up with the girls giving him a blowjob in the very beginning?

2955
02:46:26,860 --> 02:46:33,180
Because he's Duke. Yeah. And they're acting in the game and they're acting like he's actually

2956
02:46:33,180 --> 02:46:37,500
playing it and he's got the controller and everything. Because what they're trying to do is

2957
02:46:37,500 --> 02:46:44,140
like, imagine this is you. Yeah. Hot chicks giving you a BJ while you're playing this game.

2958
02:46:44,140 --> 02:46:48,140
Awesome. Isn't that awesome? Yeah, I actually wouldn't mind that.

2959
02:46:49,180 --> 02:46:52,700
Exactly. There you go. Point made. That's some pre-order bonus right there.

2960
02:46:57,340 --> 02:47:00,620
Maybe more people would have bought the game if they gave that away as a pre-order.

2961
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:09,420
To pre-order the game and we'll suck your dick. Yeah. Hey. All right. Anyhow, what was the other

2962
02:47:09,420 --> 02:47:15,420
game you wanted to say about not Duke Nukem? Uh, you said, um, LA noir. LA noir. Ah, yes.

2963
02:47:15,420 --> 02:47:22,620
What do you think of LA noir? I actually like it. It's, um, I like how it's set in the 40,

2964
02:47:22,620 --> 02:47:26,700
in the forties and everything with all the classic cars and everything. But I,

2965
02:47:26,700 --> 02:47:32,380
I, it's not really set. You could tell it's not a complete forties game because they

2966
02:47:32,380 --> 02:47:39,260
usually don't use that language, all the F words and stuff. But besides that, it's really,

2967
02:47:39,260 --> 02:47:43,340
it looks really fun. So the F is for fun in this game.

2968
02:47:44,380 --> 02:47:50,700
Uh. All right. Forget it. Well, I, well, I mean, you know, this game's, the thing is,

2969
02:47:50,700 --> 02:47:54,940
if you like the toilet humor in Duke Nukem Forever, my understanding is that you get

2970
02:47:54,940 --> 02:48:02,540
full on beaver in LA noir. So I mean, it might be a dead chick, but still she's still warm.

2971
02:48:02,540 --> 02:48:08,540
Yeah. I mean, I like how it integrates where you have to interview the person and you have

2972
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:14,460
to figure out on your own if they're lying or if they're acting doubtful or if they're

2973
02:48:14,460 --> 02:48:19,260
flat out telling a lie. Yeah. And from what I understand in the game, when you

2974
02:48:19,260 --> 02:48:22,060
guess correct, or like, you know, you have to guess if they're telling the truth or lying

2975
02:48:22,060 --> 02:48:25,020
and then a little chime sounds, right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2976
02:48:25,020 --> 02:48:28,540
Well, what they should do is they should, instead of like just a dumb little chime that

2977
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:32,460
should sound, you should get rewarded with more pussy shots. Don't you think?

2978
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:38,220
Yeah. And if you get it wrong, you have to look at that bear picture of the Dark

2979
02:48:38,220 --> 02:48:41,340
Soccer just posted in chat. If you're not, they should just like, uh,

2980
02:48:41,340 --> 02:48:45,180
edit it, like have a little, uh, blur there or something, maybe.

2981
02:48:45,180 --> 02:48:49,340
There you go. There you go. All right. Well, anything else on your mind tonight, CD Thunder?

2982
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:55,740
Oh, let's see. What other games are on your radar to play soon?

2983
02:48:57,660 --> 02:49:03,100
Um, I haven't actually played those two. I just mentioned, I was just looking at play through

2984
02:49:03,100 --> 02:49:09,500
something, but, um, I haven't been able to listen to you guys lately because I've been working,

2985
02:49:09,500 --> 02:49:14,860
but I'm glad I've been able to tonight. You guys have made my evening and rock on.

2986
02:49:14,860 --> 02:49:19,740
Don't forget. There is always the podcast. You can take us with you in your pocket every week.

2987
02:49:20,860 --> 02:49:23,900
All right. Did you say something? I couldn't hear you.

2988
02:49:23,900 --> 02:49:27,980
Yeah. Just plug in the podcast. That's all right. OrangeLunchRadio.com. More information.

2989
02:49:27,980 --> 02:49:32,220
You can take us in your pocket with you and listen to us whenever you want. Not just Sunday nights.

2990
02:49:32,220 --> 02:49:35,420
All right. CD Thunder, thanks so much for the call and enjoy the potty humor.

2991
02:49:35,420 --> 02:49:37,180
Hee hee poop poop. All right. Thanks. Bye.

2992
02:49:37,180 --> 02:49:41,020
Bye. All right. Uh, let's go to another call since our phone's ringing off the hook. Hi,

2993
02:49:41,020 --> 02:49:44,380
you're on Orange Lunch Radio. Who's this? Let me turn down my computer. Hey,

2994
02:49:44,380 --> 02:49:46,620
this is Sky Judo. Hey, Sky Judo. What's on your mind?

2995
02:49:46,620 --> 02:49:50,860
And I just have, uh, one thing I want to mention and then I want to go into a game.

2996
02:49:50,860 --> 02:49:55,020
All right. Um, when you guys are talking about the killer dolls, do you remember, um,

2997
02:49:55,020 --> 02:50:00,060
a couple of years ago, the news report where the, um, they had like these cabbage patch dolls that

2998
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:03,820
if you, I guess you hold like a spoon up to their mouth or something and they would chew

2999
02:50:03,820 --> 02:50:06,300
and they were actually like eating little girls' hairs at night.

3000
02:50:06,300 --> 02:50:10,860
Yes. I remember that. Yes. They had to like fix those dolls because yes,

3001
02:50:10,860 --> 02:50:13,660
like some girl got their hair caught in it or something, right?

3002
02:50:13,660 --> 02:50:18,060
Yeah. A lot of girls. I mean the, um, the news report had me cracking up because like if you're

3003
02:50:18,060 --> 02:50:22,460
a fan of horror movies, you know, there's always like some type of instruction on how to kill the

3004
02:50:22,460 --> 02:50:25,020
monster. Hilarious.

3005
02:50:25,020 --> 02:50:28,860
Yeah. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. So on the news, they actually had

3006
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:33,100
instructions on what you would have to do if you caught the cabbage, the cabbage patch doll

3007
02:50:33,660 --> 02:50:37,740
eating your kid late at night. Like you had to twist the head off and there was like this whole

3008
02:50:37,740 --> 02:50:42,540
ritual that you had to do. It was great. That sounds awesome.

3009
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:46,540
I would have just gotten a pair of scissors. There was actually like four main things they

3010
02:50:46,540 --> 02:50:51,260
tell you to do to like dismantle the doll before I ate your kid. It's great.

3011
02:50:51,260 --> 02:50:56,620
Oh my God. That's awesome. And yeah, don't feed the dolls after midnight and not leave them in

3012
02:50:56,620 --> 02:51:01,100
direct sunlight. Yeah. You gotta leave that story and read it.

3013
02:51:01,100 --> 02:51:03,820
Yeah. I'll leave that story. What's the game you want to talk about?

3014
02:51:04,700 --> 02:51:09,340
It's a card game actually. I know everyone on all games is, uh, you know, they're like

3015
02:51:09,340 --> 02:51:13,660
ready to rip their hair out because I've been calling every show talking about it.

3016
02:51:13,660 --> 02:51:17,740
Now it's our turn now. We're the last show of the week. So it's our turn, right?

3017
02:51:17,740 --> 02:51:23,900
You, you guys have to try Yogi. Look at this game up, man. It's, it's a fucking awesome game.

3018
02:51:23,900 --> 02:51:29,740
Yogi like the bear or the brand of tea. Well, um, it comes from some type of a

3019
02:51:29,740 --> 02:51:33,500
Japanese saying it means to read. Like it's supposed to read your opponent's mind or

3020
02:51:33,500 --> 02:51:37,260
something, you know, some, it has some kind of mystical kind of crap.

3021
02:51:37,260 --> 02:51:40,860
So you're not, you're not talking about like a card based video game. You're talking about

3022
02:51:40,860 --> 02:51:45,740
like actual table and cards. I'm down with that. Like one of my favorite games ever is

3023
02:51:45,740 --> 02:51:50,460
Millborn. It's a French game. That's cards. And it's like cars racing. It's a lot of fun.

3024
02:51:50,460 --> 02:51:53,100
And I know that tons of people are going to magic. Those are all cards.

3025
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:58,380
Yeah. Uh, you need to Google this game, uh, Google Yomi, uh, Yomi. And, uh, the website

3026
02:51:58,380 --> 02:52:03,980
is, uh, Serlin games. That's like what you can get the info on the game. And then, uh,

3027
02:52:03,980 --> 02:52:08,780
there's also a, um, a website that allows you to play the game for free against either

3028
02:52:08,780 --> 02:52:13,260
computer or other places so you can get a hang of it. But I re I recommend it. It's

3029
02:52:13,260 --> 02:52:19,820
like, um, the guy with the Yomi Yomi. What? Oh, not Yogi. I was thinking Yogi bear.

3030
02:52:20,860 --> 02:52:25,740
All right. So Yomi. Okay. Got it. The guy who, uh, the guy who invented it, he, uh,

3031
02:52:25,740 --> 02:52:30,700
he's some type of, um, high ranking, like street fighter player. Like he's done a few of those,

3032
02:52:30,700 --> 02:52:35,180
whatever the hell you call them. Oh, this is kind of interesting. This looks like I'm looking at all

3033
02:52:35,180 --> 02:52:42,380
the cards. The artwork looks very nice. Uh, yeah, I'm on this. It's Serlin games.com apparently

3034
02:52:42,380 --> 02:52:46,860
sells this. It's the Japanese word for reading and reading the mind of your opponent. It's competitive

3035
02:52:46,860 --> 02:52:50,380
card game that simulates a battle between two characters. It was like a fighting game,

3036
02:52:50,380 --> 02:52:56,860
but a card game. Interesting. It's great. And what I like about it best is, um, it's not technically

3037
02:52:56,860 --> 02:53:02,460
a trading card game. Like as once you, there's like a set amount of cards that you get and that's

3038
02:53:02,460 --> 02:53:06,380
it. It's like, you don't have to collect any more cards. There aren't any like rare cards that you

3039
02:53:06,380 --> 02:53:11,420
have to go out looking for and spending tons of money on. It's just a complete card game.

3040
02:53:11,420 --> 02:53:15,340
You know, what else is interesting about this is that I noticed every card has traditional

3041
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:20,860
card stamps on it. Like the Dodge card can substitute as a three of hearts and the flame

3042
02:53:20,860 --> 02:53:26,940
arrow is a Jack of spades. Like that's, that's interesting to me that they, yeah, every character

3043
02:53:26,940 --> 02:53:31,820
is a, uh, is a deck you could actually use as a deck of playing cards. Huh? It comes with a

3044
02:53:31,820 --> 02:53:37,420
complete, I guess, what is it? 52 playing cards deck. Yeah. Yeah. So that's pretty much the game

3045
02:53:37,420 --> 02:53:41,820
in a nutshell. All right. Where can I buy this at Walmart or do I have to get it online? Uh,

3046
02:53:41,820 --> 02:53:47,660
well there's a, um, there's a download version that you can, um, I think it's like 1495. Uh,

3047
02:53:47,660 --> 02:53:51,100
you can add, it's called an employee where I guess you just print it out from your printer.

3048
02:53:51,100 --> 02:53:55,420
Oh wow. Uh, you get little card sleeves and you can play it that way. Or you can go

3049
02:53:56,060 --> 02:53:59,740
the super expensive route and get it for like a hundred bucks to complete game.

3050
02:54:00,300 --> 02:54:04,460
Yeah, I'll take the cheap route. No, but I, I, I did the battle and it's,

3051
02:54:04,460 --> 02:54:08,060
I'm not going to take up all your time, but I did the math on it because it looked pretty expensive.

3052
02:54:08,060 --> 02:54:13,420
But when you do the math on it, like if you buy the deck separately, um, each deck comes with two

3053
02:54:13,420 --> 02:54:19,020
characters. You're getting like decks of playing cards and that's like $24 in change. So if you've

3054
02:54:19,020 --> 02:54:22,780
bought them loosely, you actually be paying a little bit more than what you put a full game.

3055
02:54:22,780 --> 02:54:26,060
So it's not, it's not entirely. You know what though? A hundred bucks

3056
02:54:26,060 --> 02:54:29,180
doesn't seem so bad when you consider how much I spent on magic back in the day.

3057
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:35,580
So the website to play it online free, I'll put it in the chat room, but you need to try that.

3058
02:54:35,580 --> 02:54:39,340
All right. Oh, that I can do free. I like that word. You should have started with that. All

3059
02:54:39,340 --> 02:54:46,780
right. All right. Thanks so much for the call and for the heads up on a new game later. All right.

3060
02:54:47,500 --> 02:54:50,620
I want to do tweets, but we keep getting calls and, and I definitely want to hear

3061
02:54:50,620 --> 02:54:53,100
what the callers have to say. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

3062
02:54:53,900 --> 02:54:57,340
No guys. It's Zina Corp. Hey Casey, how you doing? Hey Zina Corp. How you doing?

3063
02:54:58,060 --> 02:55:01,660
You know, just keeping it real. How are you keeping it real?

3064
02:55:02,780 --> 02:55:06,300
But by going to court, you know, long story. Wow. I'll talk about that.

3065
02:55:06,300 --> 02:55:09,740
Good luck with that. I hope it's not Judge Judy presiding. She can be kind of mean.

3066
02:55:10,300 --> 02:55:14,460
Yeah, that's true. It's kind of a rough. Well, good luck. Well, what's on your mind?

3067
02:55:14,460 --> 02:55:16,860
Happier thoughts. Video games. Take our mind off of that.

3068
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:24,700
Good Lord. Video games. I tried getting back into some games that I passed over because I wasn't

3069
02:55:24,700 --> 02:55:30,460
sure how far their reach would be, but since I've been on YouTube for the past two months,

3070
02:55:30,460 --> 02:55:35,420
almost nonstop, I finally decided to try out both of the, uh, defense of the agent clones,

3071
02:55:35,420 --> 02:55:39,660
legends of, uh, what league of legends and the heroes of new earth.

3072
02:55:40,460 --> 02:55:42,940
League of legends. Yep. I know those games. What'd you think?

3073
02:55:45,180 --> 02:55:50,700
I guess it depends on the time of the day you're there. Like, especially it seems that these games

3074
02:55:50,700 --> 02:55:55,580
took off more in Europe than they did here. So while you're still getting European players,

3075
02:55:55,580 --> 02:56:00,540
everything's calm, you know, when you're in a newbie room and they're actually newbies playing

3076
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:04,140
and if there's some more experienced players actually trying to help the people learn,

3077
02:56:04,140 --> 02:56:09,020
but the moment the afternoon comes up and all the US comes up, uh, it's pretty much like,

3078
02:56:09,020 --> 02:56:11,660
get the hell out you noob left and right. It's ridiculous.

3079
02:56:11,660 --> 02:56:16,140
See, I hate that shit. Like, I wish games had a better structure for noobs how to play.

3080
02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:20,540
You know, one game I randomly played this week, I forgot to mention in my top of the week was

3081
02:56:20,540 --> 02:56:24,060
Starcraft 2. I just randomly was like, I want to play Star Jeweled again because I love the

3082
02:56:24,060 --> 02:56:27,980
Star Jeweled add-on. That like made that game 10 times better. And you know, part of me was like,

3083
02:56:27,980 --> 02:56:31,820
I should learn how to play like real Starcraft and then go online and play. But then I'm like,

3084
02:56:31,820 --> 02:56:36,700
no, I'm too scared because there's no, like, there's nobody like me. Everybody that plays

3085
02:56:36,700 --> 02:56:39,260
Starcraft online is already really good and wah.

3086
02:56:40,380 --> 02:56:45,340
Yes, that's the truth. I tried getting back into a game here and of course I'm still in the Bronze

3087
02:56:45,340 --> 02:56:51,100
League, but now Bronze League is quite seasoned. So you really have no hope. You got to play your

3088
02:56:51,100 --> 02:56:55,260
buddies and that's it. That's about the only way to do it. What do you think about some of the

3089
02:56:55,260 --> 02:56:59,580
upcoming Defense of the Angels? Like there's a Blizzard Dota is coming to Starcraft 2 speaking

3090
02:56:59,580 --> 02:57:04,220
of which, and then we have actual Dota 2 from Valve soon.

3091
02:57:04,940 --> 02:57:09,660
I'm not holding my breath. The game is not going to change at all. I mean, it's good. It's going

3092
02:57:09,660 --> 02:57:15,100
to play almost exactly the same. Even like with Heroes of Newerth and League of Legends, the only

3093
02:57:15,100 --> 02:57:20,780
thing they really change is how the functionality of the game and it's switching from one to the

3094
02:57:20,780 --> 02:57:25,260
other is painful. You get set up for the way one game works and it messes you up for the other. So

3095
02:57:25,260 --> 02:57:27,420
you pretty much got to pick your flavor and stick with it.

3096
02:57:27,420 --> 02:57:30,460
So who do you think will walk away victorious at the end of the day, Blizzard, Valve,

3097
02:57:30,460 --> 02:57:33,500
or one of these other games? I hope they all drop to tell you the truth.

3098
02:57:33,500 --> 02:57:38,540
They need to work on something more original. Touché.

3099
02:57:38,540 --> 02:57:43,980
Hey, I told that to a Blizzard headhunter while I was in school. It's like I called them out on

3100
02:57:43,980 --> 02:57:50,700
it. It's like, why does Warcraft 3 play like Warcraft 2 and Starcraft? And he did it. Yeah,

3101
02:57:50,700 --> 02:57:56,380
everybody was there like, because they sell gazillions. That's why they all play the same.

3102
02:57:56,380 --> 02:58:01,260
Yeah, exactly. Because it's the same damn game. And I heard he actually wanted to talk to me

3103
02:58:03,900 --> 02:58:08,940
after the headhunter briefing he was doing at the school, but I think I already left in disgust. So

3104
02:58:08,940 --> 02:58:13,420
I didn't get a chance to give it to him directly. Who knows? I might've missed out on a job.

3105
02:58:15,020 --> 02:58:21,340
Nice. Well, good luck. I hope maybe you'll get a second shot with Blizzard at some point. Don't

3106
02:58:21,340 --> 02:58:25,900
mention that all the games are the same. Also, I got one final thing for you. Has

3107
02:58:25,900 --> 02:58:32,140
anybody seen the Comic-Con coverage for the Star Wars MMO?

3108
02:58:33,580 --> 02:58:40,300
Not extensively. I haven't been really watching this carefully. I'm kind of just waiting for when

3109
02:58:40,300 --> 02:58:44,700
the game gets really closer to release, but I know a lot did come out of Comic-Con.

3110
02:58:44,700 --> 02:58:48,940
Yeah. Based off what I saw, because they had actually, they showed the first part of an

3111
02:58:48,940 --> 02:58:55,820
instance adventure. And any wild head that played this game, I don't think you're really going to

3112
02:58:55,820 --> 02:59:00,540
see any difference. I see based off what I saw in the video, I mean, it's up on YouTube now,

3113
02:59:01,180 --> 02:59:07,420
but based off that footage, you still have the same tropes. You still have the same

3114
02:59:08,380 --> 02:59:12,540
player classes, the same structure. That's what I heard is that it's so well with

3115
02:59:12,540 --> 02:59:16,860
Star Wars laid over it. And I was really hoping for a little bit more. Where can I find that video?

3116
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:22,220
Uh, it's on YouTube. Let me, I'll see if I can dig up the link for you and put it in chat.

3117
02:59:22,220 --> 02:59:24,940
Okay Ed, do that for me and I'll check it out here in a minute.

3118
02:59:24,940 --> 02:59:30,300
Yeah man. That's pretty much all I had. I'd say wait until you see more footage

3119
02:59:30,300 --> 02:59:33,500
on the game before you make an adjustment to do the initial investment.

3120
02:59:33,500 --> 02:59:37,420
Well, you know, we'll see how much it is and I definitely won't get that collector's edition,

3121
02:59:37,420 --> 02:59:41,420
but you never know. Especially if they cut the price as fast as they did on Rift,

3122
02:59:41,420 --> 02:59:43,980
I definitely have no excuse not to check it out.

3123
02:59:43,980 --> 02:59:47,260
Yeah, but this LucasArts stuff, they're not cutting that price anytime soon.

3124
02:59:47,260 --> 02:59:51,260
That's true. All right Xenocore, we're going to let you go buddy so we get more calls. Take care.

3125
02:59:51,260 --> 02:59:52,860
All right. I'll take that link for you. Take care.

3126
02:59:52,860 --> 02:59:58,620
Thanks. Bye. 1877 game OLR or username on Skype is orange launch radio if you'd like to get through.

3127
02:59:58,620 --> 03:00:01,660
Let's do some more tweets while we wait for at least one more call to come through here.

3128
03:00:02,220 --> 03:00:07,820
Kibben project tweets us sensationalism go. Sad as it is, if he felt pains in his chest,

3129
03:00:07,820 --> 03:00:11,660
he should have called an ambulance then and there. You might know what story is coming.

3130
03:00:11,660 --> 03:00:17,260
It's a link to a story about death by Xbox. That's the headline from The Sun.

3131
03:00:17,260 --> 03:00:20,060
Gotta love it. I wonder whose phone they hacked to get that headline.

3132
03:00:20,780 --> 03:00:28,700
Game addict 20 killed by deep vein thrombosis. Apparently a 20-year-old died from a blood clot

3133
03:00:28,700 --> 03:00:34,700
because he played his Xbox for up to 12 hours at a time. And his parents, of course, were stunned

3134
03:00:34,700 --> 03:00:39,980
by it saying, quote, as a parent, you think playing computer games can't do them any harm

3135
03:00:39,980 --> 03:00:43,980
because you know what they are doing. Kids all over the country are playing these games for

3136
03:00:43,980 --> 03:00:49,660
long periods. They don't realize it could kill them. I mean, 12 hours at a time, though,

3137
03:00:50,620 --> 03:00:56,620
shouldn't you? It's a parent sessive. That was not a good way to do it. That's the parents

3138
03:00:56,620 --> 03:01:04,540
not interfering and saying, hey, you need to slack off. Yeah. So maybe, um, your kid was obsessive

3139
03:01:04,540 --> 03:01:10,380
and you should have put a stop to it. That too. There is that. All right. Uh, let's see,

3140
03:01:10,380 --> 03:01:15,740
going on to more tweets. Uh, Roboditya Knight tweets us saying, hi, OLR. Have any of you played

3141
03:01:15,740 --> 03:01:20,620
Action 52 for the NES? This is another one of those multi-cart games, isn't it? I don't think

3142
03:01:20,620 --> 03:01:24,460
I have. Let me look it up real quick. I want to see what this is. Does that sound familiar,

3143
03:01:24,460 --> 03:01:29,180
Dark Soccer? You, you've, you know, a lot of the old school stuff. Yeah, but I never played

3144
03:01:29,180 --> 03:01:35,740
multi-carts. I'm assuming it is. Just from like ROM sets, but I haven't really played it because

3145
03:01:35,740 --> 03:01:39,020
why bother playing a multi-cart when you can play the actual game? I am actually looking at the

3146
03:01:39,020 --> 03:01:44,940
multi-cart. It did come out in 91 and then it was also out in 93 for Genesis consoles. They say a

3147
03:01:44,940 --> 03:01:49,580
lot of the titles had major glitches in it. Let me get to the next call. We'll talk more about this

3148
03:01:49,580 --> 03:01:54,460
in a minute. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hey, it's Strelok. Hey, Strelok,

3149
03:01:54,460 --> 03:02:01,820
what's up, buddy? Uh, not much. Uh, just wanted to, uh, say well played Nintendo. Well played.

3150
03:02:01,820 --> 03:02:06,220
Ah, I was hoping somebody would call in on this. What did you think about all this Nintendo news

3151
03:02:06,220 --> 03:02:14,780
this week? Um, it's both. You can tell it, you know, they were desperate because the 3DS hasn't

3152
03:02:14,780 --> 03:02:19,340
really been selling well because they really should have waited like another year. Or at

3153
03:02:19,340 --> 03:02:27,100
least until the holidays. Yeah, um, but at the same time, the way they did it was just fucking

3154
03:02:27,100 --> 03:02:35,820
genius because everybody wins. People who are, have waited, which is probably a lot of people

3155
03:02:35,820 --> 03:02:42,860
because, you know, people are waiting for your actual games to come out and, uh, you know,

3156
03:02:42,860 --> 03:02:48,620
and for like a price drop. And, you know, people who have already bought the system,

3157
03:02:48,620 --> 03:02:54,620
you know, they're getting 20 free games and some exclusive stuff. So, you know,

3158
03:02:54,620 --> 03:03:02,860
it's good for everybody. And also it's really good for Nintendo because, um,

3159
03:03:05,420 --> 03:03:13,180
they've really made sure by doing this that the 3DS is probably going to be, end up being the,

3160
03:03:13,180 --> 03:03:17,500
uh, number one Christmas gift this year with the price drop. You know,

3161
03:03:17,500 --> 03:03:21,340
I could see though, to be fair, as much as I, I pretty much agree with you on all these points,

3162
03:03:21,340 --> 03:03:25,500
I, I, to be fair, I could see where somebody could still be pissed off at Nintendo because

3163
03:03:25,500 --> 03:03:29,340
maybe these 20 years, maybe Virtual Console just isn't really interesting to them. Or,

3164
03:03:29,340 --> 03:03:32,860
you know, they already bought them all on the Wii, so they don't really want them on the,

3165
03:03:32,860 --> 03:03:37,580
uh, 3DS. It's kind of like $80, you know, that's still a steep cut.

3166
03:03:38,220 --> 03:03:40,860
You're getting free stuff. I mean, they, they could have just gone,

3167
03:03:40,860 --> 03:03:47,660
uh, yeah, we're not going to, you know, we're not going to throw you a bone and look at Apple.

3168
03:03:48,380 --> 03:03:52,620
Yeah. It's just the price of being an early adopter. And that's not even like,

3169
03:03:52,620 --> 03:03:56,060
that's not even just with the 3DS. That's with like games in general. Dude,

3170
03:03:56,060 --> 03:04:00,380
Loki just mentioned the price of Duke Nukem Forever dropped already. That game is maybe

3171
03:04:00,380 --> 03:04:06,220
two months old, you know, and you didn't get nothing for free, no free hats for being an

3172
03:04:06,220 --> 03:04:11,900
early adopter. So, I mean, this is just the nature of the beast. Yeah. But I, I think it's, uh,

3173
03:04:14,140 --> 03:04:19,020
I thought it was brilliant that they put the spin on it that they did because,

3174
03:04:20,780 --> 03:04:26,700
yeah, it was a desperate act, but it's going to, I think it's really going to save them in the

3175
03:04:26,700 --> 03:04:33,660
long run because, you know, like eventually, like, well, the, like the DS launch was kind

3176
03:04:33,660 --> 03:04:38,860
of shitty too. That didn't have very many good games for a while. That's true. But look at it

3177
03:04:38,860 --> 03:04:46,220
now. The thing it had going for it most of all was the Mario 64 port that was on it. Yeah. But

3178
03:04:46,220 --> 03:04:52,700
now it's the best selling handheld, like pretty much ever. I mean, like the original Game Boy,

3179
03:04:52,700 --> 03:04:58,380
but it's, it's, it's doing well. It is. All right. Well, any other thoughts on your mind

3180
03:04:58,380 --> 03:05:04,220
tonight before we let you go? Um, yeah, I'll crack your head with a fucking ratchet.

3181
03:05:05,420 --> 03:05:11,260
Gee, thanks. All right, buddy. Thanks for the call. All right. Later. I wish I still had that

3182
03:05:11,260 --> 03:05:16,460
soundboard up. I would have played something in response to that. It's on our Tumblr. I just,

3183
03:05:16,460 --> 03:05:19,500
I don't have the Tumblr up. All right. That's going to do it for the calls tonight. We got

3184
03:05:19,500 --> 03:05:22,860
to get through the rest of these tweets. Thank you guys for calling tonight. Sorry,

3185
03:05:22,860 --> 03:05:26,460
if you didn't get through, but you can always send us an email mailbag at orangelaungerated.com

3186
03:05:26,460 --> 03:05:31,100
or you might be able to get a last minute tweet in real quick. Look at it. The suggested retail

3187
03:05:31,100 --> 03:05:38,140
of action 52, $200, but it really was, I guess like 52 different like games that were in it.

3188
03:05:38,140 --> 03:05:43,100
Like they actually have, they were all different games. I'm sure they were all shitty. In fact,

3189
03:05:43,100 --> 03:05:49,500
one of them, I guess, crashes right when you started up. Awesome. All right. Uh, let's see,

3190
03:05:49,500 --> 03:05:54,540
going on to more tweets here at twitter.com slash O L R M and Ziba tweets us about, you know,

3191
03:05:54,540 --> 03:05:59,660
we were talking earlier in the show about WTF battleship. She tweeted us the monopoly

3192
03:05:59,660 --> 03:06:03,260
parody movie trailer. I don't know if I want to play this whole thing. We can start in the

3193
03:06:03,260 --> 03:06:09,900
beginning here. Let's see. Richie Benjamin never followed in his father's footsteps

3194
03:06:12,300 --> 03:06:16,940
until one day when all that changed, this is where your father left you

3195
03:06:16,940 --> 03:06:21,420
a board game.

3196
03:06:29,180 --> 03:06:30,140
Thanks a lot, dad.

3197
03:06:38,140 --> 03:06:41,660
He threw all the, he threw all the houses on the ground and then of course the house shook

3198
03:06:41,660 --> 03:06:46,140
go in a world where money matters.

3199
03:06:50,460 --> 03:06:52,460
You lost kid. Who are you?

3200
03:06:57,020 --> 03:07:00,380
For the first time in his life, Richie is taking a chance.

3201
03:07:02,780 --> 03:07:05,340
I want to teach you all about the game.

3202
03:07:05,340 --> 03:07:15,180
Rolling the dice. Yeah, it's got strippers. This is already better than the battleship trailer.

3203
03:07:15,980 --> 03:07:23,980
Never fall in love. Unless it's with money. The community chest.

3204
03:07:23,980 --> 03:07:34,620
Oh, this is great. Love her more than money. I don't care what you think because now I have

3205
03:07:34,620 --> 03:07:44,380
the monopoly. Oh son, don't you know only I can win this game this summer. Do not pass go.

3206
03:07:44,380 --> 03:07:54,380
You didn't pay the luxury tax. Go to jail. Do not collect $200.

3207
03:08:06,780 --> 03:08:08,700
That was great. I would see that.

3208
03:08:08,700 --> 03:08:14,780
They should screen that at midnight at the shadiest looking theater in town.

3209
03:08:16,780 --> 03:08:19,900
After Rocky Horror, of course. Of course.

3210
03:08:22,060 --> 03:08:25,820
Act Def tweets is something that somehow we missed in our news feed tonight. Dragon Age

3211
03:08:25,820 --> 03:08:30,700
got removed from Steam because of DLC issues. Basically EA has a lot of sand in their vagina

3212
03:08:30,700 --> 03:08:34,860
and it basically has to do with origin. But I guess what they're saying is it has to do with

3213
03:08:34,860 --> 03:08:39,740
the whole, you know, it's that whole thing where Steam wants to control the download stuff but EA

3214
03:08:39,740 --> 03:08:45,420
really wants that in their own house and herpa derp. EA says at EA we offer our games and content

3215
03:08:45,420 --> 03:08:51,180
to all major download services. Unfortunately Steam has adopted a set of restricted terms

3216
03:08:51,180 --> 03:08:55,820
of service which limit how developers interact with customers to sell downloadable content.

3217
03:08:55,820 --> 03:09:00,620
No other download services adopted this practice. Consequently some of our games have been removed

3218
03:09:00,620 --> 03:09:09,420
by Steam. Whatever. That's a bummer. Dragon Age is a pretty cool game. Uh, apparently,

3219
03:09:09,420 --> 03:09:15,820
uh, Darth Tetsuya is tweeting and saying WonderCon 2012 moved from San Francisco to Anaheim

3220
03:09:16,460 --> 03:09:24,380
just for the next year. That's kind of a big deal. Like, that's far. That's a six hour drive between

3221
03:09:24,380 --> 03:09:30,060
the two if not more. WonderCon, which is probably the second or third largest comic convention next

3222
03:09:30,060 --> 03:09:38,060
to actual Comic-Con and maybe what, New York Comic-Con, uh, is moving. But I guess it's just

3223
03:09:38,060 --> 03:09:45,980
this year. Yeah. Interesting. Oh, but they're saying now there are some updates saying nothing

3224
03:09:45,980 --> 03:09:51,900
has actually been confirmed about this. I guess Anaheim is in discussion right now.

3225
03:09:52,620 --> 03:09:55,420
So it's don't freak out yet. Yeah, maybe it's don't freak out yet.

3226
03:09:55,420 --> 03:09:59,900
Uh, let's see. Uh, Darth Tetsuya is saying Wonder what the holdup was for the worldwide release of

3227
03:09:59,900 --> 03:10:07,420
La Mulana. It's Germany! I guess La Mulana has been held up for release in Germany. What is it?

3228
03:10:07,420 --> 03:10:14,300
Uh, I'm trying to read here. The ratings board of Germany, excuse me, the USK,

3229
03:10:16,300 --> 03:10:21,100
uh, Nigoro, who developed the game, submitted the game for review to the ESRB, the OFLC,

3230
03:10:21,100 --> 03:10:26,140
and the USK two months ago. Uh, those, the other two boards have the game ready to go,

3231
03:10:26,140 --> 03:10:32,060
but the USK has not finished yet. Interesting. I guess they can't release it until it gets reviewed.

3232
03:10:32,860 --> 03:10:38,860
Sorry, Joe. I know you're a big fan of La Mulana. Maybe soon. Spazinator giving us an update on the

3233
03:10:38,860 --> 03:10:45,100
PS3 saga. I sent my PS3 in for repairs this past Friday. I figure that I'm likely to get it back

3234
03:10:45,100 --> 03:10:51,820
early next week. We will see. SSJ100Matt tweets us saying the only way to defeat China is to attack

3235
03:10:51,820 --> 03:10:59,740
their productivity. Coming soon to China. Angry Birds. That's right. Angry Birds is coming to

3236
03:10:59,740 --> 03:11:05,180
China. Uh, I guess, uh, in order to prevent knockoffs and so forth. I don't know. It was

3237
03:11:05,180 --> 03:11:09,740
officially launched in May through a partnership with Chinese mobile games network Downjoy.

3238
03:11:09,740 --> 03:11:15,340
Uh, but so far, there's been all these knockoffs and pirated versions on jailbroken iPhones,

3239
03:11:15,340 --> 03:11:21,580
but now Rovio has teamed up with the ad network Madhouse to try and expand the game's presence.

3240
03:11:22,940 --> 03:11:27,820
I still say, uh, Angry Birds isn't really all that, and I don't understand why so many people

3241
03:11:27,820 --> 03:11:36,540
are so like losing their shit over it. Amen. All right. Uh, Tigerclaw sends us a tweet here.

3242
03:11:36,540 --> 03:11:41,740
Samsung is going to be manufacturing the PlayStation Vita CPU. Uh, the core processing

3243
03:11:41,740 --> 03:11:46,780
unit or central processing unit of Samsung's upcoming portable will be, excuse me, by Sony's

3244
03:11:46,780 --> 03:11:52,140
upcoming portable will be done by Samsung. These are from Samsung. These are from online reports

3245
03:11:52,140 --> 03:11:58,060
out of Japan. Uh, this was on the website of Japanese industry paper, the semiconductor

3246
03:11:58,060 --> 03:12:04,220
industry news. Not a lot of further con, uh, text besides just that, but there you go.

3247
03:12:04,220 --> 03:12:12,300
Samsung will play a role in the actual development of the Vita. There it is. Your Twitter topics,

3248
03:12:12,300 --> 03:12:17,420
twitter.com slash O L R. If you want to get in your tweets in the future. By the way,

3249
03:12:17,420 --> 03:12:24,620
huh? Did you hear about the, um, last sales reports on, um, smartphones? Motor roll is dipped

3250
03:12:24,620 --> 03:12:30,460
way down. Well, yeah, cause libraries going out, it's all Androids and, uh, iPhones. Now

3251
03:12:30,460 --> 03:12:35,500
the top three is Apple, Samsung and Nokia. Interesting. I would think blackberries are

3252
03:12:35,500 --> 03:12:39,900
still big in the corporate world. They're interesting. They've gone way down. They're

3253
03:12:39,900 --> 03:12:46,060
not, they're not in the top three. So interesting. All right. Well, uh, before we close out the

3254
03:12:46,060 --> 03:12:49,020
show tonight, I got to go to Loki and ask if there's any last minute stories he wants

3255
03:12:49,020 --> 03:12:57,100
to tear through. Um, no. Wow. We, we covered quite a bit of everything. So there you go.

3256
03:12:57,100 --> 03:13:04,700
All right. Well, uh, we'll work on more last minute stories for next week, but I guess

3257
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:08,220
we've covered everything so far tonight. If you think we missed a topic, you can always

3258
03:13:08,220 --> 03:13:12,300
email us mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and we'll bring it up on next week's show.

3259
03:13:12,300 --> 03:13:15,820
Um, thank you guys of course, as always for downloading our show and supporting orange

3260
03:13:15,820 --> 03:13:20,700
lounge radio. We really appreciate it. Remember we do the show for free. We don't play commercials.

3261
03:13:20,700 --> 03:13:24,380
All we really ask help spread the word about orange launch radio. Get more butts in our

3262
03:13:24,380 --> 03:13:28,860
chat room on Sunday night. Tell a friend about the show. Even if you're like, I don't really

3263
03:13:28,860 --> 03:13:32,620
know who I could tell about orange on video, help spread the word on websites. Uh, there's

3264
03:13:32,620 --> 03:13:37,260
people that put signatures on forums, uh, or just as simple as leaving a five star review

3265
03:13:37,260 --> 03:13:41,500
in iTunes really goes a long way because that drives the popularity rankings and helps us

3266
03:13:41,500 --> 03:13:45,820
get exposure to more people. Uh, there's been some reports on the internet this week that

3267
03:13:45,820 --> 03:13:50,540
I've seen come up on Google plus and all that, uh, people linking stories saying podcasting

3268
03:13:50,540 --> 03:13:57,580
is dying. Well to that I say because maybe corporate podcasting is dying, but people

3269
03:13:57,580 --> 03:14:00,940
like us were never really in it for the money anyways. And we were doing this since before

3270
03:14:00,940 --> 03:14:06,620
podcasting. We're not going away anytime soon. We're awesome sauce, but we can still use

3271

3272
03:14:11,100 --> 03:14:17,580

3273
03:14:17,580 --> 03:14:22,060
and get everybody's final thoughts. So dark soccer, what's your final thought tonight?

3274
03:14:22,060 --> 03:14:27,340
Um, I think we're going to miss pinkberry. Yes, this makes me sad, but, uh, we'll, we'll do it

3275
03:14:27,340 --> 03:14:33,260
another time. Maybe on Tuesday. I would like to do a tiny little plug. Look on geek life tomorrow,

3276
03:14:33,260 --> 03:14:40,300
geek-life.com for a special geeks in history that has to do with Nintendo. All right. A Nintendo

3277
03:14:40,300 --> 03:14:45,740
geek in history. Yes. Very cool. Uh, Loki, your last minute story tonight. Oh, I don't have any

3278
03:14:45,740 --> 03:14:51,500
last minute stories, but excuse me, your final thought tonight. Uh, fortunately today is both,

3279
03:14:51,500 --> 03:14:59,500
uh, very sad and, uh, but kind of happy tomorrow though. Sad because it is the two year anniversary

3280
03:14:59,500 --> 03:15:07,180
of the twins death. Unfortunately, uh, we lost two babies two years ago. Um, however happy news,

3281
03:15:07,180 --> 03:15:11,900
though. Josh's first birthday is tomorrow. So, uh, happy birthday to Josh. I never realized it

3282
03:15:11,900 --> 03:15:16,380
was in such class, close proximity to each other. Everything is on the 31st of the first.

3283
03:15:17,180 --> 03:15:23,340
Interesting. Well, you know, um, looking forward, uh, I look forward to Josh's first birthday. I'm

3284
03:15:23,340 --> 03:15:27,500
sure it'll be looking forward to seeing pictures of the mess he's going to make. Oh, we've already

3285
03:15:27,500 --> 03:15:33,180
fed him, um, that kind of stuff. Like extra for his nephew and that party we actually had,

3286
03:15:33,180 --> 03:15:39,260
we had a professional, uh, pictures taken of him and he's eating a cupcake and that was funny.

3287
03:15:39,260 --> 03:15:45,020
Oh, that's cute. We had a picture of my brother Matthew when he was one sitting in his high chair

3288
03:15:45,020 --> 03:15:50,540
with a cake in front of him and half the cake demolished by smash, smash, smash. I think

3289
03:15:50,540 --> 03:15:54,300
there's a picture like that of me out there somewhere too. You'll never see it. He's having

3290
03:15:54,300 --> 03:16:02,140
his, uh, birthday party next Saturday. It is a pork theme party. Um, awesome. And, uh, so we

3291
03:16:02,140 --> 03:16:07,260
all have a little piggy cake then, but no tomorrow we want the leftovers. Uh, tomorrow we're taking

3292
03:16:07,260 --> 03:16:12,540
him to, uh, at least I do. Maybe not dark, sorry. We're taking him to, um, the gallery to go on the

3293
03:16:12,540 --> 03:16:18,540
merry-go-round. Oh, fun. Good time. And maybe have some ice cream. Uh, my final thought tonight is

3294
03:16:18,540 --> 03:16:25,260
there may not be time for pink berry, but there's always time for tacos. Yes. That's going to do it
