Dark Sakura

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Sky and Lowkey

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, July 24th, 2011

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Games appear to be incoming to Google Plus

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Sony experiments with Virtual Reality

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
And you know we've got to talk about Capcom

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
to talk about video games and gaming culture

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
and all of that with my co-host

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
the one and only Dark Sakura

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Jamie Summers

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
How are you doing?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Wasn't there a video game like that in Japan

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
that was all about putting your thumbs up

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
people's butts and things like that?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm not even lying, that was actually the premise

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah, it was like a boonga boonga or something

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Who wants to be a proctologist?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
But it was like spanking people stressfully

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
for something, you could either use your finger

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
or spank them

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I know and I'm stressed out

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Dark Sakura, you've been very very naughty

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Thank you sir, may I have another?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
No

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Alright, say hello as well to the one and only

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Rob Foster, Loki!

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
You're actually muted, there you go

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
How are you doing now, Loki?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I'm doing better

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
We're having mic fail tonight in studio

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
If I sound different by the way, don't adjust your speakers

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
It's on our end, I'm on backup mic tonight

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
He's on helium

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Yes, maybe a little bit

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
No, I think I'm just on the overly sensitive mic

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
which for my voice is really not good

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
but that's all we got tonight

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Let's switch mics

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I have a rant or two in you tonight

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
and I'm not letting you do that on this mic

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
You will blow up speakers across America

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
and beyond

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Well what's new in your world, Loki?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Nothing

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
So Josh is turning one very soon, right?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah, a week from Monday

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Your baby is turning one

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
and the other week you were talking about

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
your possible party plans you were doing

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
and I was talking to the wife today

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
and it sounds like you guys have settled on a theme, correct?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Well yeah, it was always going to be

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
like the pork party

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Oh, I thought at one point you were talking about

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
the pedo bear party or the...

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
No, those were just funny ideas we were throwing around

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
I see, I see

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
So you are going to do the pork party?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Teach the child at a young age about the wonders of bacon, right?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Of course

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Well have fun with that, that'll be a lot of fun

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Alright, we're going to have fun with you guys here

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
live at All Games Radio

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
www.allgames.com

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
as we do every week, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
9 o'clock Eastern

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
at the Bobby Black Wolf Show

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
If you want to join us and chat, we are ready to go

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
in our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
and we do read comments

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
from chat throughout the show

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
For instance, some folks commenting

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
on Booga Booga, the game we were talking about

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
a minute ago, Act Def says

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
that game didn't make it outside of Japan

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I wonder why, y'all

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
But no, like Google it

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
it was a real game

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
so it's something else

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I had the money and it was cheap enough

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I'd import it, it's really expensive

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Give that to Josh for his birthday

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
It'd just be fun to have

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
just put it in my garage

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
What the hell's that?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Hey guys, want to come over?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
You guys would come over if I said, hey guys

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I got Booga Booga in my garage

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'd be like, hell yeah, I'm coming over

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I'd be like, I'll be there in 15

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
It'd just be weird

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Hide your cameras

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
We always like to start off the show

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
with a little bit of how is your gaming week

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
So let's go around and talk about the video games

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
we've been playing this week

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
DarkSakura, what have you been doing?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I played well

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I finally hit my next item level

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Congrats, addict, dealer

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I played some other games

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I played Kid Dracula

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
again, because I love that game

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Going back, kicking it Game Boy

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Kid Dracula is an old ass game

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
We actually watched a playthrough

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
of the NES version

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I was playing the Game Boy version

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
and I have been fighting and fighting with Planet Harriers

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
to get it to work on MAME

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
to no avail

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It's because it's not done yet

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I know, but there's Hikaru, Bios

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
and all this other stuff I was playing with

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
and it's not working

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
So

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
So some classic gaming in your week

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah, lots of classic gaming

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
and Peggle

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Which is destined to become a classic in the future

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I think

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
It's too new

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Hopefully EA won't ruin the franchise

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I did find out, however, that someone did

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
bejeweled for the Cliccovision

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Oh really? Like a homebrew?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Yeah, bejeweled for the Cliccovision

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Does it actually exist on an actual cartridge

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
or is it, you can't really do that

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
it's only through emulators

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
I'm sure, anything that's a ROM

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
you can put on a cartridge

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
as long as you have the right, you know

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
thing to write to it

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Dan also found something

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
this Cliccovision that they were going to be working on

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
that they

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
halted production, but someone finished it

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
and has like a full arcade version

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
of Donkey Kong

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
So Dan was playing that day and then he played the homebrew

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Donkey Kong 2 on his computer today

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
So we've been all about the homebrew

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I saw an

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
interesting little cabinet the other day

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I was at this pizza joint in town

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
that had, it wasn't an old

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I'll tell you that right off the bat

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
It was some other type of machine that had a lot

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
of classic games in it, but the interesting thing about it

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
is it was Pac-Man

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
and Donkey Kong and Galaga

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
and it was kind of like, you don't usually

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
see Nintendo games participating

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
in the collections

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
because Nintendo keeps that

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
stuff to Nintendo, so it was kind of weird

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
like where did this, like the Play Choice

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah, where did, no it wasn't Play Choice though

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
it was like actual arcade Pac-Man and Galaga

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
and stuff, so

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Let's talk about the Nintendo ones, oh yeah I remember those

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
The Nintendo were the Play Choice games, or like the Wii

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
and stuff now, you don't see a lot of like the retro

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
It had to have been the homebrew type of

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I don't know, it was interesting

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
though, because I remember

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
SalaciousPop commenting on it like, those are

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
games you wouldn't usually see together in a collection

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Yeah, but I don't think it's a homebrew

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
thing, they have

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
other machines that are very similar to

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
you know

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
the

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
multi-game machines, they have like

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
packs that you can buy

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
so it's like okay, here's Atari games, here's

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Nintendo, here's

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Capcom or whatever

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
So they've got those out there

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
It's just I didn't know Nintendo to usually participate

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
in those, usually it's kind of like they

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
keep it for their own systems and so forth

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Eh, maybe

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Alright well let's move on, Loki how was your gaming week?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Same old

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
stuff, didn't really play a whole ton

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
of stuff other than basically

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Grand Theft Auto and

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I think I did play a little

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
bit of Earth Defense Force in there this

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
week, mainly Grand Theft

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Auto

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Just, you know

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
What do you expect when I play at lunch all the time?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It's basically

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
what we've been doing

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I thought that was going to get replaced with Earth Defense Force

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
in South Armageddon now that that was out

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
It does, but here's the thing

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
My boss usually wants to play during lunch

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
and you know, it's only so many

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
players for Earth Defense Force

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
You don't have a third copy

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You know, he just really

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
puts the peer pressure on

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
about wanting to get kicked

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
get his ass kicked

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
in Grand Theft Auto and so I have to

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
oblige, you know

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Are you going to tell your

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
boss, no I'm not going to come speak to your ass

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
at Grand Theft Auto? Thank you for reminding me

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Has he ever threatened to fire you over how good

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
you are at Grand Theft Auto? Yes, lots of times

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Almost

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
every week

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I'm always like, you know we have reviews

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
coming up soon

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I'm like, I don't care

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
No, it was funny

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
We have these nice

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Sony headsets

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Like, headphones, I should say, not headsets

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Headphones that we use

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
for the gameplay

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
We have it hooked up through the stereo connectors

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
on all the VGA cables

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
But, you know

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
As you know, you can't really

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
talk over a headset

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
because the headset goes on your head

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
and it's usually meant for people that have TVs

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Really? A headset goes on your head? Yeah, I know

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
A headset goes on your head

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I've been doing it wrong!

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
You'd have to wear a second pair, like a second set of

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
headphones on top of it, so it's just

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
not practical

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
So what did I do? I thought, hey, you know what?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I got a few of these wired headsets

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
from Microsoft, I'm going to break them apart

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
and make them work

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And so that's what I did, I snapped the

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
headpiece off

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
broke the thing apart, I took out the

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
actual speaker from the

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
headphone, and then of course

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
the only way I could attach it to it is with

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
plain old

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
tape

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Scotch tape

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Not even duct tape

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Here's the reason why I did Scotch tape

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
because these are nice headphones

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't want to ruin them

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I just want it to stay

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
And it works great, because now we have the nice headphones

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
and we can talk

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
you know, for the occasional

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
person that's from

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Mexico, or

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Usually it's the UK

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
We've got people that complain in the UK

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
and every now and then it's like

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
gee, I really wish I had a headset so I could

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
tell them to shut the hell up, because

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
you know, they'll be like, oh, you have

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
to use the stickies to kill me, what?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
You suck, you just can't, you know

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
kill me with anything else, so then I proceed to kill

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
them with every weapon in the game, and then they still

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
complain, so

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
So you've gotten in lately

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
long story short, you've fixed headphones

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
so that you could smack talk people on

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Xbox Live this week. Yes. And what types of things

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
do you tell them off with? Do you want some

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
tea and crumpets with your wine? I haven't really

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
been using it to talk. I originally

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
gave it to my coworker, Jason

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
unfortunately we had to take it away from him because

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
all he kept doing throughout

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
the first game was going, hello

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
hello

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
and we're like, listen

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
okay, you're not going to talk like a rapist

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
over the god damn

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
you know, headset, or taking that damn

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
thing away from you. No, I gave it to

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
my other coworker, Rob now, and he

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
uh, he'll usually do a Julia

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
child impersonation on the

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
which is pretty fun. First we're going to get

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
the cake and kill you with it. It's all

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Hello, boobies!

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Wait, that sounds like Dame Edna

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
actually. Hello, my

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
puppets!

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Well unto your death!

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I didn't say that his, you know,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
impersonations were good, but he'll do like

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
you know, the French Knight

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
from, you know... Shall I kill you

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
with my sticky whip?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
But there's some pretty funny ones

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
like, I love playing with the people in the

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
UK because I love their

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
accent, and the kids that we play with on there

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
you know, I'm going to get

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
the orange, fella! You know, just like

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
really proper English is hilarious

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
to me.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
By the way, I didn't think

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
any British impersonation could be

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
worse than mine, but yours is really

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
bad. Well, I was doing an

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
impersonation when he does. I

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
can't vouch for his impersonation

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
of anything, but no,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
it's just fun.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Really, this is just a temporary thing

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
until I get my Saints Row

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
headset. Now, we do know that

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
the Saints Row Collector's Edition headset is not

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
compatible through Live

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
without some adapters

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
that I can easily find.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
So I will have my auto-tuned

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
voice. They're selling headsets for Saints Row

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
that you can't use for Live? Yes, it comes

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
with the Collector's Edition. It's only meant for

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
PCs and phones.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Okay. It's because it's got a

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
3.5 millimeter

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
connection, whereas most of those things are

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
2.5. They were too cheap to make a deal with Microsoft?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Yes, they were too cheap, so basically

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
there's a thing that you can get

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
that splits

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
a headset

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
into the, you know,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
both the speaker and the microphone

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
port, and then there's something in the reverse

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
that goes to 2.5 millimeters, so

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I can get

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
that stuff, and I can make it

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
work. I've already figured it out.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I've already bookmarked this stuff on Amazon.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
It's all a matter of waiting now.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I'm surprised you don't own one

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
of those little trash talker things

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
for Xbox. I know SSG100 Matt's been on

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
the show before talking about those.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
They were using, well, we all were playing

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Perfect Dark one night with some of the understation

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Live people. He was using one of those frickin'

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
trash talk devices.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I was gonna do one better on that,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
as I was actually going to, and I can do this

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
once I get that actual

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
device to connect my auto-tune

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
headset, is

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
you hook up a splitter to it, and then you hook it up to your

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
iPod or iPhone or whatever,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
and just pull up a soundboard

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
and tap away.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
But yes, the trash talk's pretty awesome.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
It's only four. I mean, sometimes you want

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Duke Nukem to see a few other things

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
other than the four preset stuff.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
That's right. Four insults

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
is very limiting. Exactly.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Repeat yourself a little much. Alright.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And pushing buttons on the headset

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
and stuff to make Duke Nukem

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
say things. It's funny, but see, the problem is

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
because I cut the speaker

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
off, so I can't hear what it's

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
actually saying, I can't hear myself talk

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
over everything.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I can only

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
hear my coworkers saying,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
oh yeah, I heard you.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
That's the only way.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
So, good luck in your trash talking with

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
the Brits adventure.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Whatever comes of that.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Let's see, my gaming week.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Actually, not a whole lot of new stuff.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I had a very Jamie week. All I really played

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
was wow, this week.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I did play a few other things

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
though. There was a few other things I played.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Like, I went back to the fitness game,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
and I gave that another go. Remember I razzed that game

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
on the show last week, the Urself Fitness,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
because it didn't have me stretch beforehand.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Well, this time I stretched,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
and what do you know? I made it a lot further

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
in the opening act. I actually made it

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
through the entire calibration this time,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
and didn't feel like

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
dying the next day. My legs were a little

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
sore that night, but it wasn't nearly the

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
pain and suffering I went through the week before.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Like, I'm actually walking today.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
It's a miracle. If you really want to see it.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Why don't you come over to my place? Why do I always have to come over here?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
You should come pet the kiddies.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I do want to go to your place, but you've never

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
given me your address, silly Rob.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Well, my address is...

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Oh, wait. I can't say it here.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Alright.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
One, two, three, any street.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Anytown, USA.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
That's right. Anytown, USA.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Actually, true story, I will give you

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
I will give you a hint

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
to where I live. I live not far

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
from a place called Safetyville, USA.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
No shit. There's this little

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
place, and everybody

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
you see a sign for it on the freeway, and everybody

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
drives by going, what the fuck is Safetyville, USA?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
It's a place where they

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
take kids in elementary school

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
and it's one of those tiny

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
towns where all the buildings are built

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
at a kid's height or whatever

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
so that when they're walking through the town, they're little

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Godzillas in the town, but it's where they learn about

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
safety and look both ways

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
before you cross the street, or the little plastic cars

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
will get you, you know, things like that.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
But it's adorable to drive by and look at

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
because it's all these tiny, chibi little buildings.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
So I don't know why, but Loki talking about

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Anytown, USA, maybe think of Safetyville, USA.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
It's like that town in hot fuzz.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I guess.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I haven't seen hot fuzz, so I guess.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
There's like a miniature of the main village.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Who's there? Yeah.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I don't see like any movies. I was just talking about this the other day.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I didn't see Captain America.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I didn't see Green Lantern.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I didn't see Green Hornet.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Green Lantern was shit anyway.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Well, but you are clearly a Marvel fan girl.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
No. DC fans

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
have said that Green Lantern

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
I heard it was terrible. I don't know.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Look. Look.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I know some of y'all don't want to hear it,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
but I would gladly pay money to look at

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Ryan Reynolds for two hours, okay?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
But it's actually not him. It's a CG fake body.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Now when Deadpool comes out...

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Imagination's all the same. Alright.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Look. That's not what we're here to talk about.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Other games I played this week. I did check out

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
the demo for one new title. I don't like

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
doing game reviews based on

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
a demo, but I will say it was

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
a great demo, and it did kind of sell me

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
on the game, and that was Bastion on Xbox

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Live, which is a new game that's out

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
for their Summer of Arcade.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
And I did spend a night the other night

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
just playing through that. It wasn't too

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
long. It was probably about 30 minutes to maybe

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
an hour tops. But kind of

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
the premise of it is it's very much like an

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
isometric sort of game.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Made me think of... I don't know why when I first

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
started playing it, my mind went back

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
to like Solstice

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
and Equinox, which is not a

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
bad thing, okay? I don't know if you know these games.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Solstice was on the Nintendo, and Equinox

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
was a Sony ImagineSoft game.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Sony logo on the

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Super Nintendo. And Equinox

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
is one of my favorite Super Nintendo

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
games they ever made. And a lot of that has to do

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
with the music. But anyway, it's that very isometric

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
kind of dungeon exploring thing.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
And I used to love those games.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
And so when I played Bastion

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
it kind of was that same thing. I was like, oh, this is kind of cool.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
But the art style is very different.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
The art style reminds me a little more of something like

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I don't know, Braid or something. But what I thought was really

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
neat about it is that the levels kind of appear

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
as you're walking. Very

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
interesting. And then of course most of all

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
the way the story is told is that

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
there's a narrator in the game

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
who sounds a lot like this.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
He's kind of a little bit of Isaac

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Hayes in his voice.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
And he's narrating the game.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
And he's talking about that the hero

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
just got up. And so then your character gets

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
up. And like you're walking down and you

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
fall, like let's say you're just clumsy and you fall off the

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
ledge. The hero falls to his

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
death and it's game over. And then

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
he'll fall back from the ceiling. Just

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
kidding. Just like

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
crazy things like that.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I'm sure that's the first

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
thing everybody's going to do when they play Bastion

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
is kind of like, oh my god, that

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
narrator has got to stop even though they

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
really enjoy it. So it's

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
cool. Yes,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I played through the whole demo and I liked

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
you have different kinds of weapons.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
You have a hammer and a crossbow.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Or you have a bow that you charge

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
like a singular bow.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Or I think there was a magic type

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
weapon as well. But you can only really carry

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
three of the four. So you do have to kind of make some

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
decisions. And I just, I don't know, I thought that was

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
kind of neat. Just the whole

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
way it was designed. So I definitely think I will pick up

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
the full version of that. It does seem to

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
be like there's, like I noticed right

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
when I got to the end of the demo in the main

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
world,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
well not the main world, but like I guess

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
the Bastion square or whatever the central

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
square is that's supposed to be like the hub

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
that I guess the rest of the game takes place through.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I noticed that there was a place where I

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
could put a shop

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
of one of two types. I could pick

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
one or the other. So it's kind of

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
like the choice on what you put there will

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
affect your game a little later. Unfortunately

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
the demo doesn't let you kind of fully

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
realize that out. But

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I'll have to tell you more about that when I pick up

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
the full game. So yeah,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I thought that was kind of rad.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
So going to chat.orangelauntrader.com

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
to see if there's any feedback on the game

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
here. Zether says Bastion

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
needs to be on Steam. I think

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
it was an Ubisoft game. No,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Warner Brothers. It's a Warner Brothers game. It might show up on

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Steam. You never know.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Dark Tetsuya is asking, can you do the rest of the

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
show like that? No I can't.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
But maybe I'll do one of the

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
same. Maybe I'll read an email tonight in that

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
voice. Dark Soccer can pick an email and I'll do it.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Okay. Alright. I'm just

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
kidding. I'm not going to do it.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Let's see. Stop trying to

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
get out of reading emails.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I think that's really it. Otherwise

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I've just been playing a lot of the other same stuff

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I've been playing. Like Beat Hazard. I tried

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
to play Survival Mode one night.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I didn't get very far. I got through like a song and a half.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
And just playing some other

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
stuff on Steam. Bit.Trip and some of the other games

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I've talked about in previous weeks. Bastion's probably the

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
only new thing I've played. I have two games

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
at home sitting for my game rental service

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
waiting to play.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
And I just haven't gotten around to playing them.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
And that's Test Drive

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
2 and

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
one of the Need for Speed games. I don't even remember

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
which one. But hopefully

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I will have a racing-a-thon in the next few

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
days and I can talk about those games on next

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
week's show or something.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I'll tell you what else too

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
is something I did this week is I went

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
to the mall because I was just wanting

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
to get out of the house going to the mall. And

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
we realized that we had a gift card that we wanted

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
to spend at GameStop. And

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I kind of felt a little dirty going to GameStop

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
because I have to tell you guys, I am currently

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
boycotting GameStop. And

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
you know, I'm not going to tell

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
anybody else what to do. And I realized

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
that there are people that might

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
be employees of GameStop and so forth

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
that listen to this show and I want you to know the boycott

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
does not have to do with any

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
type of like store employee.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
But the management of

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
GameStop is like doing things

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
to a friend of mine right now that

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I really don't agree with. And we're talking

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
like things of a legal nature

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
that just like disgust me.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Like the way this person who worked for this

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
company with so much loyalty for so

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
many years really I think demonstrated

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
and somebody who I think

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
almost in some ways

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
gave up opportunities elsewhere to go

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
work for this company.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
And just to see the way that they're being

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
treated now by this company

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
because of

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
other situations that happened just

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
it just disgusts me.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Like I am disgusted by the actions

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
of GameStop and I can't say too much about

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
what's going on because there's a whole

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
legal element to it. Yeah I know

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I know but it's just

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
it's just infuriating and I refused

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
to give my dollars to a company

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
that's going to do that to people.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Like it's it's gross

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
and it's

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I don't know I'm not going to support it.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Like I'm not going to support

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
this company

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I don't I don't I don't even know

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
how far I want to go with this. I got to be careful

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
what I say but I'm just I'm just I'm boycotting

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
GameStop. If there are

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I would encourage you

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
but I'm not going to tell you what to do. And I

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
realize we may have employees that listen to

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
the show and this is no fault

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
of like a store employee or anything like that.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Like I realize people have to do

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
what they have to do especially in this economy to make a living

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
but I'm just going to say

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I hope

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
sometimes I really hope these rumors

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
are true that digital distribution may kill GameStop

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
and that's again no offense

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
to those of you that work in the retail front.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I hope you all find other jobs somewhere else

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
very soon. It won't because they bought

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
a digital distribution company. Well

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
that will hopefully fail miserably. That's

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
that's what I hope because the management

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
and the uppers at GameStop clearly

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
are just assholes.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
I don't have and I have freedom of speech

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
freedom of press granted to me in the

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
U.S. Constitution. I can say in my humble

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
opinion GameStop management is

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
assholes and I am not going to support

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
a company run by assholes.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
It's as simple as that.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I will now step off my soapbox

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
la la la la la. But that was something that came

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
to mind this week. That's actually something that I

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
wanted to address like two weeks ago. But

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
I think it was the same week as our ninth anniversary

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
show so I kind of never got into it. And now

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I'm not as ranty pants

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
as I probably would have been that week.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
So but I

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I'm feeling like I

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
needed to touch on that at some point. If you don't ever

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
hear me talk about that store again now you know why.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Let's see. Unless it's bad news about

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
them. Well I

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I will continue to do my job of

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
reporting on them in

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
the most impartial way I possibly

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
can here on the show.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
You know whether the news is good or bad

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
we'll continue to report on it so you guys can

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
talk about it. But just don't expect me to be their

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
cheerleader. You know Dan's been like the recipient

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
of like three payouts from

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
class action lawsuits. Really.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Yeah. Really. Well

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I hope...

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Like a hundred bucks

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
you know nothing major but

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
there's been a number of them

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
and a number still going on.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Act Deft in Chat says was it the

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
planking thing? I read about

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
that where the GameStop employees got fired

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
for doing the planking. Believe it

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
or not. Now I can't believe

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
I'm going to say this after my rant. Planking?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Have you heard of this? Is that like that Pilates

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
move? Do you remember like in the 50's when people

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
used to sit on flag poles and that's what

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
was cool? Yeah. Ok what's cool now is to

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
put pictures on Twitter of yourself

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
lying dead in the most

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
strange places like in the middle of traffic

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
or what these GameStop employees

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
did. Do a

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
news.google search on

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
GameStop planking and a guy is lying

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
dead between two GameStop

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
displays like a plank. He was laying on

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
top of the displays. Yeah he's lying

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
on top of the displays and I got to

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
admit like even though I just chewed GameStop

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
out there that was

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
a real dumb thing to do is to be in

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
your GameStop uniform and take

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
a picture like that. I mean actually

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
in that case I kind of

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
think I know why GameStop fired. They do have a corporate image

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I think they're allowed to do that

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I gotta say. Otherwise

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
they're assholes. It's like the stewardess

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
that put pictures of herself you know on

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
the airplane you know and showing some

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
cleavage. Or the Disney employees at

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Euro Disney that were all in the costumes and

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
they were doing nasty things backstage

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
like don't put that shit

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
on the internet. Like

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
if you're gonna do it keep it on your phone and

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
laugh at a party or something. Don't put it on the

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
internet. That was the dumb thing they did. Keep in mind

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
my experience with planking has to do with

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
bodies.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Oh here we go. Act F. See this is why

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
I love having a live chat because chat will actually

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
link us to these things live.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
So there you go. I'm gonna bring

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
this up so you can see the picture here

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Dark Sakura. This is what

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
I can't believe. Oh Spaznator

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
in chat tells me that flagpole sitting was in

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
the 1920s.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Actually that was

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
um. I thought it was the 50s.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
No. Okay then

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
swallowing goldfish or

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
this is actually kind of cool.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Why you like that?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I think that's ridiculous.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Well I mean it is ridiculous but it's kind of

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
neat you know. That's some good

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
abdominal control. And as

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I've complained about. You are the most

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
unpredictable woman I've ever met. Okay.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
And that is saying a lot because most women are

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
unpredictable. This is

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
retarded. I'm sorry

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
stupid. I've been

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
told not to say retarded by my wife.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
You might have been retarded people.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Well you should cut back on that

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
quite frankly.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
It is incredibly

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
stupid. I mean this

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
coning which is the new thing where you

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
You're offending stupid people. Where you go through

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
the drive-thru order an ice cream cone and then

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
you grab the ice cream off the cone.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Who cares? I would just think you're

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
stupid. Good job

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
man. Ah you're smart.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Wait tell me that. What is coning?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
You get an ice cream cone

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
and then someone else runs by and takes the ice cream off the cone.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
No no no no no. Okay.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Coning is where you go through the drive-thru

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
of a fast food place

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
you order an ice cream.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
An ice cream cone that comes on a cone.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Instead of like a normal person

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
grabbing it by the cone and enjoying your ice cream

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
you're a dumbass and you

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
grab it by the ice cream.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
And you shove it in your face.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
And that is coning. Or

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
yes. This is

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
what. These are the people

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
that will be voters someday.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
They're not already. Thank you for

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
ruining the world. I thought

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I thought that was called fire in the hole.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
That's what people did. And that

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
like actually was not cool because like

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
somebody got burned over that whole thing. But like

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
the fire in the hole is where you go through the drive-thru and you

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
order like the combo meal and then you yell

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
fire in the hole and throw the soda

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
out through the window.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
But some some asshole

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
did it with coffee and like burned

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
some guy. That is actually not funny.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Well of course it always takes stupider

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
people to you know ruin everything.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And then there's a new thing called owling.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I would demonstrate owling if

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
except I don't know if this chair would hold me.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
But owling is basically where you

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
kind of squat down on top

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
of something like you're a stupid owl.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
And you take a picture of it because you know

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
planking wasn't dumb enough.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
So the people have to

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
come up with even dumber things.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I don't know.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
It's just stupid.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
The internet makes people

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
stupid.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
We have proof.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
So anyway

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
I didn't mean to get

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
you're not supposed to

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
after I do a rant like that on GameStop

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
you're not supposed to give me a news article where I agree

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
with one of their crappy management decisions.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
They also fired

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
the person that took the picture.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I think it's justified.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I hate to say it but like you know

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
you're there to work not to do

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
fucking planking photos. Well I can't make my

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
fellow employee do his job if he wants

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
to go lay down on something.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I'm taking the picture to expedite

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
this whole retarded

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
stupid thing that he is doing.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Well okay but let me

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
put it this way. Let me put it this way.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Let's say those employees

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
leave their position

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
at GameStop and go

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
plank somewhere else.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And GameStop threatens to do things to them

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
because they've done things after the fact.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
That's kind of what's going

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
on in another situation right now and

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
that's why I think it's just

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
icky.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
So that's all I'm going to say.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I feel better.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Alright let's move on. Let's talk

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
about well we've done our gaming weeks.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
How about some housekeeping? You can always find us on

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Let's move on

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
and talk about some news

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
and what's going on in the gaming industry this week.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Let's see what else Pizzas' offer makes us happy.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Oh I can't wait to see where we're going to

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
start tonight. What is

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
the internet talking about tonight?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Let's talk about a wonderful

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
wonderful game that was

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
highly anticipated. Made by

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Capcom.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Long awaited sequel to

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Mega Man Legends. Mega Man Legends 3

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
this project that they were also kind of

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
getting input from the fans

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
themselves to help them

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
create this game.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
They said you know what?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
We're not going to put it up.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Originally they were

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
going to have

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
this prototype version that was going to

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
hit the eShop

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
and you're going to be able to download it.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Then they started doing this crap like

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
well not a lot of people download

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
this game. We're not going to make it.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Now they're like well there's not

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
enough systems that sold so

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
we're not going to make it.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Basically the actual

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
quote

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
unfortunately it was

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
not felt that the Mega Man

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Legends 3 project met the

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
required criteria to go into

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
full productions and thus it was

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
pulled.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Apparently they're saying there's

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
a fan campaign going on

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
now to get people to

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
put this game out. I have a few

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
problems with this. One, not to

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
be rude but that fan campaign will be about as

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
effective as the mother fan campaign.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Sorry. Number

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
one, who told

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Capcom to fucking put it on 3DS

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
anyways? I mean that's risky.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
You're kind of assuming well it's a Nintendo

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
system. It's going to sell incredibly well.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
What happens if it doesn't?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
They're like what do you mean what happens if it doesn't?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
It's a Nintendo system. It's going to sell incredibly well.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I mean that's kind of

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
their logic there. Then when it didn't they're like

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
crap.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Um

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
but I don't understand

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
why they just don't put it out on

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
our system. I mean god it can't be that

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
hard to port a Playstation

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
1 looking game onto

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
another

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
system like Xbox Live Arcade,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Playstation Network, WiiWare. Now you've

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
always been quite the fan of Mega Man Legends

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
haven't you? Because I remember

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
earlier episodes of this show and I mean like

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
early in the first few years of the show where you were talking about

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
how much you love those games and you always wish they

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
make a third one. So now here it is

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Capcom's going to make a third one and then oh well

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
you know what actually. And it was one of the reasons

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
I got a 3DS.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Granted not one of the top reasons I got

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
a 3DS.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
But at this point it'll take any reason to get

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
you know to justify

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
getting a 3DS because there's not many reasons

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
out there. But it's one of the things

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
it's seriously stupid because

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
this is one of the games oh yeah we're

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
the fans wanted this and we're going to

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
take all this fan support. Then they're like well

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
we didn't get a lot of support on this so

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
uh you know

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
So they're going to give they're going to abort

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
they're going to have a live abortion of Mega

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Man and make all their fans watch. Yeah I love it.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
We didn't get enough support on the forums

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
for this you know

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
voting processing.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I'm sorry but

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
you're the fucking game

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
developer why do you need people to

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
input on the game? Well we didn't get

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
enough input on the game so we don't know

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
what to do. Well what do you do in the situation

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
where you don't ask the fans what they

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
want you just I don't know

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
create the develop if you

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
will the game. The

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
crowdsourcing was not up to our expectation

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
so we fired all the employees

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
you. It was stupid

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
it's it's just Capcom

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
being Capcom now I'm sorry

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
but Capcom's kind of

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I don't know what they're doing. I

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
think some people higher up are making

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
really dumb decisions.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Okay so let's go to comments from our chat

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
chat.org.com. Breakman says

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I think Legends 3 was cancelled because they wanted

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
to shove it in Inafune's face.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Well the

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
creator of Mega Man left some time ago. Well that's

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
that's awesome yeah let's shove it in his

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
face that's

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
yeah that'll show the fans.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
I

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I don't see the point.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Do you think there could be legit you know to play

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Devil's Advocate here a little bit could there be legitimate

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
concern on Capcom's part

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
that there just wouldn't be money to be made off

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
of this game. That maybe they're going to go through

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
all the trouble of developing it and the fact

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
that the 3DS has not quite

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
sold millions and millions right now

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
and the fact that you know

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Mega Man's Legends is a title

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
that's many years old maybe it really

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
wasn't destined to sell that many copies.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
So therefore it's not worth doing.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
They've done more retarded

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
things like they put out

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
was it the Mega Man powered up Mega Man game

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
on the PSP and

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
the Mega Man I think there's a Mega Man

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
X kind of remake thing

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
on the PSP as well

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
that I mean the PSP it

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
didn't have that many people that bought it

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
and in a game like that especially

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
where it's just a remake of the first Mega Man

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
game not a lot of people really cared

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
about that even though it was kind of cool they had a level

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
editor and stuff like that it just didn't

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
really strike me as

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
something big like

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
a sequel to

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
a really cool franchise

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
that people have been clamoring to get

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
more of and obviously you know people

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
love the characters because I mean you have

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Tron Bon and

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Marvel vs. Capcom 3

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
and 2 and you know

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
there's cameos from the

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Servbot characters are everywhere

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
like you know and Dead Rising

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
and all that stuff and people love

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and Tatsunoko

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
vs. Capcom I mean

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
they're definitely around there it's just

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I don't know

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
it's just kind of stupid

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
there's some games you just put out to make

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
the fans happy and granted you're not going to make

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
a lot of money on it but

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
I'm sorry but when you're

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
not really marketing this game

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
you're not really

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
needing the talent

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
to come up with all this stuff since you're

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
having fans kind of create everything

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
for you I don't

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
understand why

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
why you would even have

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
a big budget for this let me go to the

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
chatroom and read some comments there's an

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
interesting perspective here we have GameGuru in our

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com says

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
the problem with porting a game like

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Mega Man Legends 3 to Xbox Live and PSN

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
vs. the 3DS is because

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Capcom could sell it for $40 on a

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
physical medium vs. $15

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
on a digital only medium

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
TheRobD in our chatroom says reasons

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
why Capcom probably cancelled Mega Man Legends

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
3 not many people like

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Mega Man Legends 1 and 2

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Inafune left 3DS didn't sell

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
well lack of fan demand

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
pick any of those reasons all of them are valid

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
that said with the fan support they were

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
asking for they should have released the game

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
who said that they couldn't put it on a physical medium

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I mean they could have easily done that

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
and put it out as a disc sell it for $40

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I mean people would have eaten it up

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
oh yeah especially if they'd released it like

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
as a budget title quote unquote where it was like

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
$29.99 or it would have sold like crazy

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
I think and you could do

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
download content later on because everyone's

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
about download content but

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Capcom just doesn't get it and I

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
mean I know we're going to be talking about

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
some other stuff from Capcom but

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
let's look at what they're doing I mean

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
here's their good ideas that they

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
have coming out there's some

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
new IPs from them so I'm

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
not really commenting on those but

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
the stuff that's existing

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
like there's a Dead Rising 2

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
off the record it was basically

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Dead Rising 2 the way we should have done it in the first place

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
because the last one didn't sell very well

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
I mean that's kind of dumb

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
and then you have

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Ultimate Marvel

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
versus Capcom 3

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
it's like well

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
we were going to offer

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
download content for the first game

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
and we charged a buttload for a couple of them

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
and then we said

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
fuck you you buy a disc now

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
so

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
and then

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
all the stuff that they're doing on the

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
IOS marketplace their crappy

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
DRM I mean there's just a lot

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
of really bad decisions

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
and we see this similar

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
type of trend with other companies I mean

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Activision for example

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
um

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
they just kind of have to have a reality

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
check for a little bit oh and let's not

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
forget to mention Devil May Cry

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
how they're rebooting that franchise

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
and just I don't

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
even know what they're doing to Dante it's just ridiculous

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
could it maybe be that

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
it's not so much the news that they've

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
cancelled the project but it was kind of the way

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
they delivered the news like

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
part of me thinks especially seeing in our chat

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
room that there are some people that are kind of sympathetic

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
to why Capcom cancelled Mega Man Universe

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Mega Man Legends 3

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
actually there's another comment on Mega Man Universe

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
don't forget that project was cancelled too

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I'll come back to that in a minute

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
but see that's the point could it be

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
the way they handled it like you know

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Netflix took a lot of crap a couple weeks ago

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
for the way they handled the news

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
about the price increase to Netflix service

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
could maybe Capcom have handled this

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
a little better

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
well I mean

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
they could have done a few

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
other things like saying well you know what

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
we're going to explore

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
other options with putting this game out

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
the only thing that kind of

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
rubs me the wrong way about this

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
news was the whole remember they were supposed

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
to release a prototype version

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
that was going to be like a downloadable

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
demo and gauging the reaction of

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
that would be if they would release the full game or not

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
but we never even got the prototype

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
that strikes me as odd

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
like that they talked about this whole

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
well you better buy the prototype if you want the game

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
essentially is what they're saying without saying it

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
and now they've just canned the whole

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
thing they're not even going to let the prototype come out

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
that strikes me as very

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
like just

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I don't know like at least get the

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
prototype version out and see what happens

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
it was probably I'm guessing

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
some sort of licensing thing maybe with

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Inafune maybe it's just

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
maybe that's why

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Mega Man's not in Marvel vs. Capcom

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
you know 3 or the new Marvel vs. Capcom

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
3 update

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
or whatever or

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
I don't know

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I really

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
when I heard it was cancelled I was like ehhhh

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
whatever

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I wasn't that

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I thought it was cool but I wasn't

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
super psyched I mean it would have been nice to have a

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
game that I was kind of looking forward to on

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
the 3DS but I've just kind of come to

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
accept that the stuff on the 3DS

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
there's just a lot of the stuff I was looking

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
forward to and

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
trust me there's been already 3 games

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
cancelled on the 3DS including

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Mega Man Legends 3 that I was

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
looking forward to for the 3DS

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Saints Row on the 3DS and

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
DJ Hero on the 3DS all of those

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
well DJ Hero is not surprising though considering what

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
went on over there I understand that but these were all

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
games you know that kind of sold me

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
on a 3DS other than you know

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Kid Icarus looks pretty awesome

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I think Nintendo is going to recover a little bit

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
come Christmas time though and I think some of these

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
companies might regret it you know

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I don't know but we'll see I want to read some other comments

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
in chat because some of these are really good here

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Sj100 Matt in our chat room says

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
it's all a front since Kiji Inafune

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
creator of Mega Man left Capcom

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
they started cancelling Mega Man projects

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
first Mega Man Universe which was a lot of fun

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
when I played it at New York Comic Con

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Mega Man Legends 3 and the lack of Mega Man

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
and Marvel vs. Capcom 3

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Capcom obviously doesn't want Inafune's image

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
as a part of them anymore

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
well you can't say Mega Man

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Universe was

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
or the Mega Man Universe was completely omitted

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
because Tronbon's a character and Servbots

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
show up there but I also

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I do I will admit I had a similar train of thought

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
is that this whole stuff had me thinking

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
as I thought about well gee they cancelled Mega Man

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Universe 2 and now they cancel this and I thought

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
how come we never got a Mega Man

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
11 like didn't Mega Man

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
9 obviously did crazy good

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Mega Man 10 I think did alright but I think

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
a lot of people were just like okay

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
you know jokes jokes getting old now but like

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
I'm a little worried like does this mean Mega Man

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
at all is

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
done for now I mean I realize the creators left

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Capcom so that's a very distinct possibility

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
but it's a big deal we had Katamari games with other creators

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
being there I mean it's

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
none of them really were as good as the original

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
well that's because they didn't try

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
but you know the whole point is

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
is it that they can't make any of these games

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
or they're just not I mean cause

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
if they're not I don't understand

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
I mean get over your guy themselves

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
you know if you're just like well we don't want his

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
character you know he left us

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
we left us

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
so sad I mean get over

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
yourself Mega Man's an iconic

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
character I would think I would be challenged to make

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
the best Mega Man game we've ever made

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
if you really if you really

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
want to get at him make

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
the best Mega Man game that anyone's ever seen

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
we don't need you anymore

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I mean but

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
but they did they do need him

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
that's essentially what they're admitting

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
right?

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I guess

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
alright

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
let's move on with some more gaming news

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I suppose of course you can always join our chat room

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
where a lot of folks

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
kind of going back and forth on this talking a little bit about

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
the Twitter and how the announcement

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
was handled there on Twitter I did not see this

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
but I guess it was pretty harsh on the Europe

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Twitter anyway

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
yikes

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
so more gaming news here this is a rumor

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
that's been confirmed to be true

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
and it has to do with

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Goldeneye Reloaded remember this

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
we saw a listing for this on Amazon.com

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
a couple weeks ago and it turns out

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
it is true the Goldeneye remake

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
is coming out on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
3 some screenshots were released

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
earlier this week

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
it is interesting because

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
the game press release

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
didn't even mention the Nintendo 64

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
original or last year's

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Wii game interesting

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
but nevertheless the game is coming out

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Daniel Craig is still playing

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Bond not Pierce Brosnan

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Activision says that the game will

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
run at 60 frames a second it will

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
support the PlayStation Move sharp shooter

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
gun controller interesting

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
so

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
there you go it's also going to support 16

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
players online the Wii version only

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
supported 8 they're saying more maps

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
weapons characters and game modes

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
interesting

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
so what do you guys think is this a game that interests you guys

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
I passed on the Wii version

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
but I did play it at E3 and I thought it was okay

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
it's just my Wii kind of collects dust now

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
if they release this at the right price

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
I think I'd be interested

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
but I just have a bad feeling it's

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
going to be a $60 title and I just think there'll be

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
too much other stuff this holiday I'm more

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
interested in I concur that's

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
really I think what our issue with that would be

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
yeah it's going to be really be the price that this

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
comes out and I'm not

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
seeing your price here on the list so I guess

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
we just have to assume it's probably going to be full price

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
most likely

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
just hopefully they're smart enough

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
not to release it like a week before

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Modern Warfare 3 comes out

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
like the last

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Bond game release dates

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
are really crucial in gaming I think

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
that's something we're kind of coming to learn over the past

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
couple years I mean come on

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Activision get your shit together

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
you know that you have Modern Warfare 3

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
coming out the week after you may

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
think huh you know if we put this game

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
out a week before we're only going to get

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
maybe one week of sales because everyone's

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
going to go oh my god you know

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Modern Warfare 3 who gives a shit about

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
buying this

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
honestly this is a game this Goldeneye

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Reloaded is a game that should be out now

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
like it should have come out now because

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
what do we have right now nothing

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
right now nothing I mean

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
yes I realize they want to you know get

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
a lot of the Christmas sales and so forth

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
but at the same time you got to be real

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
you either look at why the one on the Wii didn't do

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
you can't put that out this holiday

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
because you've got you know let's

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
let's start with the September

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
you've got Gears 3 and Resistance 3 coming

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
out you've got the

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
following month Battlefield 3 coming out

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
and then you have Modern Warfare 3

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
it's just going to get lost

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
you need to

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
you know you need to really put that out either in August

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
or you're going to have to wait until

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
winter don't worry about

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
getting it out for holiday because

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
or put it out in December

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
because there's nothing in December

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
nothing

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
DungeonBuster in our chatroom

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
at chat.orangehonestgrady.com says

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I already played the Wii version no need to play it again

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
but 16 players

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
online and new characters and new maps

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
and HD OMG

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
sign me up

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
it would be really hard to ask somebody to pay

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
60 bucks twice though because you know the Wii version

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
or excuse me the Wii was probably only about 50 bucks

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
but at this one's full price it'll be 60 bucks

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
it's going to be hard to ask somebody to pay

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
that twice especially for what

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
was essentially a remake of an old game

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I'd rather see an HD remake of

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
TimeSplitters 2

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
and why that game?

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
that game is awesome

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
even TimeSplitters Future Perfect would be awesome

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
it was such a great shooter

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
alright

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
well let's move on with some more news

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Dark Soccer what do you have for us tonight?

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
well we have some news about

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Google Plus actually

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
they have

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
they're going to be getting some gaming features

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
soon it's actually on the help page

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
according to

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
a few sources they say

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
that they're going to do something called

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
game stream where you can check

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
for updates on the games that you're playing

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
and

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
actually when it was on there

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
the link to it now is a 404

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
oh

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
so

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
but it said that there are

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
something is in the source code

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
that are games get game friends

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
games get activities and games post

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
to stream so

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
hmm

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
well I mean this isn't

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
I mean this is kind of a duh

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
especially if you think about that we had

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
news before that Google had invested

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
in Zynga a couple months ago

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
actually maybe more like six months ago

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
they'd invested what like a hundred million dollars

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
in Zynga so

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
I mean the fact that games are going to

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
come to Google is a bit of a duh

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
but you know a it's about how

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
soon and I think the question that really has

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
everyone wondering is how

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
are they going to implement it because this could

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
really make or break Google plus

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
a lot of the a lot of folks are really

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
excited about Google plus right now why

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
because it's not Facebook and

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
what Google plus is doing right is that

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
they're giving people a lot of what

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Facebook has been very slow

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
or very stubborn to give and that is

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
a decent mobile

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
app for starters

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
once

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Apple finally approved it

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
let's see they have given folks the

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
control total control over well I shouldn't

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
say total because there's some things about

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
the privacy they even frustrate me too in the pictures

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
department but like you have to have

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
a public profile to keep your account

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
as of the end of the month

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
oh really yes actually as of the

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
27th interesting I posted that on

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Google plus oh I missed it but

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
yeah they said if you're you're in a circle

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
with people I don't read their stuff I'm kidding

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
I just missed it it can be

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
as little as just your name yeah

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
but you have to have a public profile

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I think I well I thought you

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
just kind of had one by default it's kind of like

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Facebook you

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
have a profile but as long

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
as you know

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
you lock everything down nobody sees

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
anything but your name and your default picture

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
which doesn't have to be you yeah I think

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
that's it but I mean but they're saying that for people

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
who have them fully private then

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
their Google plus accounts are getting wiped

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
no they wouldn't

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
wipe that's what it says well wouldn't you just

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
change it from private or something that seems

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
a little ridiculous hold a second I will get it

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
for you alright yeah share the story because I'm curious about

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
that so then Google might damn

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
themselves on all these you know hey we're gonna

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
do privacy right and then oh

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
well we're not that seems a little

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
bit ridiculous to me I don't know here it is

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
it says

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
and this is

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
under the Google plus project

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
area

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
public profiles the purpose of Google

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
profiles is to enable you to manage

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
your online identity today nearly all

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Google profiles are public we believe

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
that using Google profiles to help people

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
find and connect with you online is how the product

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
is best used private profiles

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
don't allow for this we have decided to require

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
our what require all profiles to be

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
public keep in mind that your

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
full name is the only required information

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
that will just be displayed in your profile

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
you'll be able to edit or remove any other information

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
you don't want to share if you currently

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
have a private profile but you do not wish to

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
make your profile public you can delete

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
your profile or you can simply do nothing all

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
private profiles will be deleted after July 31st

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
2011 that doesn't seem any

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
worse than what Facebook does I mean

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
because yeah okay so you can have

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
your name and a picture of your cat

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I mean that's that doesn't seem

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
so terrible to me

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
but there are people that are getting

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
kinda well

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
because it's a step

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
backwards for Google I think a little

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
bit in the privacy area where everybody's

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
been really I think I think it

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
kinda feels a little bit like a slap

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
or a step back when everybody's been very

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
rah rah rah circles are the right thing

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
to do circles are amazing it's

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
the whole reason why Google Plus works

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
circles are this year's squares

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
yes circles are this year's squares

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
exactly so as far as

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
going back to the games implementation though

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
I think a lot of people are nervous about how are they gonna

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
implement games because one reason that people

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
hate Facebook is that they hate

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
the so and so is growing

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
bullshit on their farm why don't you come

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
farm with them and all the

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
invites one thing and also on

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Facebook they have at least didn't do hide

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
all posts by yeah and Facebook

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I will say a lot of that got better

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
but it took a long time for that to happen

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
and so the question is how's Google gonna

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
implement it especially if they have a stake in Zynga

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
now based off of the stuff that's leaked

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
out it sounds like a

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
game play stream will be

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
a totally separate thing that

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
you would have to click on to view

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
just the game post and I think that's

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
a great way to do it that way

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
it keeps it out of my main feed where people are

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
posting cute pictures of their cat and

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
status updates and it just puts it in

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
a place where if I feel like playing a game

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
then I'll click on that stream and see what's

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
going on but I don't always

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
believe it or not I don't always feel like playing a game

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
when I go online

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
and believe it or not I don't always care what other people are playing

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
yeah exactly especially

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
my mother in Farmville

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
believe it or not everybody that sends me an invite for a game

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
I deny it

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
oh and all those people, I wish that

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
this is one thing I wish Facebook had

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
to have an option where

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
send everyone who sends you an

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
invite a message saying knock it off

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
and

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
another interesting comment from BlackWolf

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
in our chatroom and this is something I have thought

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
about before so I guess I'll address it now

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
BlackWolf says Skye one other thing to realize

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
is that they insist on you using your real

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
name if you use a pseudonym

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
i.e. you and me we are at risk of

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
being suspended from Google Plus

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
and to get unsuspended you would need to send them a photocopy

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
of your government issued ID

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
well here's the thing I think most of the reason

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
why they're doing that is they're trying to keep the

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
businesses out of profiles right now

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
and that you know my name on there isn't

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
fuck you you know like if my name

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
was Rob fuck you I think they might have

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
a problem with that I think the way

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
I'm doing it on there and the way you're doing it on there

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
we're kind of okay because we're just

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
you know we're people that are just trying to protect our

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
privacy because I think you know

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
podcasters can be in a very unique situation

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
sometimes and I've talked about

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
violations that have happened to my privacy before

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
and how alarming that can be I don't

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
want to get into that whole spiel before but it's scary

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
until you've been there so here's my thing

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
if Google Plus cancels my account fine I'll

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
stop using it I'm not going to sign

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
up under my real name period but my life

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
will go on without a Google Plus

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I won't talk about it on this show

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
I'll make my friends go to another website

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
if they want to see my pictures and give another company

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
the ad dollars or what have you

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
like I am not required

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
to use this website I think

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
it's pretty cool and I'd like to keep

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
using it but there's just

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
some things I'm not going to bend on

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
you know and if they're and what

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
would infuriate me is if

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Lady Gaga gets a profile on Google Plus

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
that will infuriate me if

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Lady Gaga gets to have a profile

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
and I would get mine removed

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
because I have to use a fake last name to

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
protect myself from stalkers

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
then that would piss me off

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
because that's a double standard

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
how come Lady Gaga gets to have a Google Plus

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
profile and not Stephanie Germanotta

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
that would piss me off

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
absolutely it would piss me off or any other

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
celebrity that doesn't go by their real name which is

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
most of them

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Cher's name isn't Cher you guys

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Madonna's name actually I think

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Katy Perry isn't even Katy Perry

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Katy Perry is not Katy Perry look at actors

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
like David Tennant couldn't register

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
under his real name because

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
there was another actor with that name registered with

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
the Actors Guild in the

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
UK the greatest

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
rock star singer of all fucking

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
time no

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Freddie Mercury was not his real

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
name either well Ringo Starr wasn't his name

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
but he had illegally changed so

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
there you go

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I like how someone in chat changed their name

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
to Rob Fuck You

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Dungeon Buster in our chatroom

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
at chat.org.com says

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Rob Fuck You from fucking Austria

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
you know what I would

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
like is if you

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
have to register under your real name but you

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
can choose a pseudonym

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
but it has to track that that would be great

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
that would be great

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
and Rama in chat says Skye but what if she

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
legally changes her name to Lady Gaga

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
she hasn't

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
she hasn't and you know if you watch interviews

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
with her which I wouldn't expect that all the listeners

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
of this show have watched Gaga

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
interviews but me being a little screaming fanboy

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
of Gaga I have watched interviews and she

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
she claims and I believe it

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
I don't see why not that there really is no difference

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
between her and Stephanie it's just kind of

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
who she that's the name that people

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
know her by which funny enough is kind of

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
what Rob Roberts has become for me

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
most people I meet don't realize

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I have a different last name but I have

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
to use a different last name on the radio

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
to protect the things I do from 8 to 5

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Monday through Friday I'm sorry but

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I'm not sharing the details of my job

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
and my life and how I pay my

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
rent and eat because guess

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
what this show doesn't do that

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
nor any podcast that you listen to

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
unless it's maybe Adam Carolla

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
podcast will not feed somebody

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
if someone gives me a job in exchange for

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
me having to blog about it then I would do

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
that yeah if you want to pay me

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
six digits a year to do this

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
show or you want us to start charging a

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
subscription fees that we start making six digits

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
a year off this show which I still wouldn't think would happen

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
then I'll happily use my

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
real last name

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
but that's you know

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
that's where it's at

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
alright anyhow I didn't mean this to turn into

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
like a stalker privacy conversation

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
but yeah games on Google Plus will you

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
play games on Google Plus let me

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
ask that I would I would think if

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Google has a hundred million dollars stake

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
in Zynga I think Zynga has

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
a hot new game that they're going to have

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
exclusive on Google Plus and I'm talking like

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Farmville 2 will be

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
like a big land for Google Plus

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
which is going to make a lot of people eye roll

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
but if they launch it the right

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
way it won't piss everybody off

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
if they if they

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
make it so that it's not in your face

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
people will be fine but this could make or

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
break Google Plus if it's if it's all

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
over and it's Facebook all over again

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
people will just go right back to Facebook

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
because they have their network built up there

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
because you know with Apple

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
going with big integration with

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Twitter and I'm

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
assuming at some point maybe like Facebook or something

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
like that you know the Android

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
iOS or Android

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
OS I guess is going

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
with Google Plus

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
since it's a Google based

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
operating system it makes sense

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
yeah

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
it has the phrase on here

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
if you're looking for updates shared from games

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
check out your game stream

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
so let's hope it's all

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
hidden in there that would be great

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
because I wouldn't mind playing Who Wants to be a Millionaire on Google

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
that would be kind of fun actually

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
well the whole reason I stopped playing

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
a lot of those stuffs and that's actually why I haven't signed up for

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Turntable yet is because

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Turntable requires you to link through

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
your Facebook and I don't like

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
all those apps associated with my Facebook

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
but the good news is I don't use my real

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
name on Facebook either I'm like

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
hey it's alright well see I

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
use my real name but I also use it as a

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
networking tool right right and

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
actually I have it to where the only people

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
who can find me are people I've invited

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
so

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I don't want to I've seen a lot of people who

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
signed up for things that I might have been interested in

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
later on it uses it'll

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
tag them as a way

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
to advertise their stuff because the tag will show

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
up on your friends feed right

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
and I don't want to be used for something that

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
they're not paying me for right

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I gotta say though I

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
chose to go ahead and go into Turntable

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
FM and I gotta say that is a

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
rad it's way better than Spotify

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Turntable FM is awesome

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
well I also read something about the

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
legalities that how they're getting away with it

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
yeah yeah somebody post that to my wall

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
if you haven't seen Turntable FM

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
how can I explain Turntable FM real quick

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
it's basically like you and your friends get to

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
play DJ and you

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
can't go in a room by yourself that's an

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
important thing to know you can but you can't do

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
anything once a friend signs up and it's you

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
and a friend you can set a queue of songs

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
to play and it'll basically go down

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
the line of up to five DJ's

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
and play the next song on your playlist

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
and it sounds so simple

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
but the great thing about it

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
this is me signing up for it are you really doing it?

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
sure why not after that whole thing

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
you just said? well yeah

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
liar no I'm not a liar but

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
that's why I'm not doing the games

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
no I know you can always and you can always go

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
revoke its permissions at any time that's the other thing

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
which I spent like an hour doing

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
because the stupid quizzes count as apps

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
oh yeah oh yeah so no one's in

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
right now so you would be going into random rooms

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
but like if any of your friends were DJ'ing their little

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
pictures would show up on the right hand side

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
and you go into rooms and it just goes down the line

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
and up to five people just it goes

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
in their playlist and it sounds so simple

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
ooh they're playing Fuel I'm going to the 90's

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
mix it's an awesome way to discover new music

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
it is an awesome way to discover new music

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
like me and a couple of my wow guildies

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
were in there the other night just playing

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
random music that we like and it was

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
it was cool I just hey have you guys

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
heard this song? and it comes up next

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
and yeah the legalities highly questionable

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
this website probably won't be around in a year

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
but I'm going to enjoy it while I can

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
there you go

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
alright uh let's

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
move on god we keep bringing up stories

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
and then it like just turns into something else completely

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
there it's on there and everyone has to

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
put up with my music

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
orange tangent radio you know what

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
after the show everyone in my room

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
you should name your room

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
pillow fight dark soccer is pillow fight

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
well but the thing is dark soccer you'd have to

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
you can't the way

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
that's set up and the way they do that legality

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
you can't

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
be the sole DJ

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
you have to be DJing with at least one

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
other person well I did make a room called dark soccer

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
is pillow fight alright so go on turntable

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
FM right now and look for it I'm not going to post any music

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
yet oh yeah I was going to say don't play music right now

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
we're trying to do a show but I've got the room made

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
alright

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
um okay so let's talk

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Sony here I guess the next

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
uh what is going to be

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
the next big thing from Sony obviously right now their

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
big push is 3D and

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
maybe it's going to be the next evolution of 3D

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
right now apparently according to

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
um an interview with develop

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
uh magazine

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
uh Sony London Studios chief

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Mick Hawking is

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
talking about some head mounted

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
3D displays that they've been showing off

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
at CES and

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
uh they're saying that we're working with a couple games at

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Sony that are experimenting with

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
virtual reality type experiences

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
and uh

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
basically saying that VR could make

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
a comeback and definitely

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
you know I think

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
yeah maybe a little bit

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
it could because

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
you know remember back in the day

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
graphics on PC's not

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
that great I mean if anyone's seen

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
lawnmower man ewwww

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
that's pretty basic stuff I saw it in the theater

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
some of those virtual reality demos

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
back in like 95 and stuff were

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
hilarious I distinctly remember

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
one to this day where you could

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
either be a dude walking down the street

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
or like in the car and it was

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
like virtual reality you could walk

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
up to these homes that were just giant blocks

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
like but it was awesome the whole

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
thing looked like um hard driving

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
yeah it seriously

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
was that basic and nowadays

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I mean you know and who knows when this

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
kind of technology will be coming out

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
just technology keeps getting way

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
better and better each year just exponentially

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
and I mean very well

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
in 10 years we could be seeing some sort of

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
3D virtual

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
reality technology being the kind of

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
standard for gaming and stuff

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
it's definitely within the realm

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
of possibility I suppose

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
and I could definitely see Sony kind of

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
this could definitely certainly maybe

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
happen it's definitely

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
possible it is a

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
distinct absolute

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
possibility

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
there is a chance

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
out there that something like this may

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
or may not happen

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
ah

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
nice

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
alright

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
so

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
moving on I guess I don't know

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
what Sony virtual reality stuff could they

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
really make that would be that awesome

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
well they could

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
really

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
enhance home

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
okay with some virtual reality technology

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
too I don't know allow more members in your

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
clubs

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
alright

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I'm trying to

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I'm thinking back to there was a peripheral

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
back in the Super Nintendo

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
days that were just basically goggles

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
you could put on your face that were just

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
televisions literally right in front of your face

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and they called it a virtual reality headset

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
for games like on the Super Nintendo

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
you know Faceball 2000

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I played at one time

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
a virtual we played a couple of virtual

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
reality games well it wasn't even

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
really virtual reality it was basically yes

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
monitor on my eyes type

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
thing but

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
it was at Santa Cruz on the

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
beach boardwalk they had a thing

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
that you could do and you could either play Quake

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
or Duke Nukem 3D

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
man

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
awesome it was pretty awesome

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
alright moving

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
there's go ahead

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I hate getting on all these tangents there's

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
something that they have at the boardwalk it's called being on

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Orange Long's Radio I know I know there's something that they

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
have on the boardwalk now it's called

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
like Safe Crackers not

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
not Safe Cracker it's like

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
some sort of like heist game

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
where you have to you go in a room

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
and you have to dodge lasers kind of like

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
you know so you're Catherine Zeta Jones

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
yes exactly basically

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
you're doing that and

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
it's a game or you're that scene out of

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Resident Evil

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
yeah it's very similar to that

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
but it's a game that you play

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
at the Santa Cruz I thought that was kind of cool

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
because I hadn't seen that before

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
my friend posted it on her Facebook

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
that's at the beach boardwalk

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
we need to do an OLR from the Santa Cruz

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
boardwalk I think that would be fun

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
we need to go Dark Sakura

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
don't you want to be like Catherine Zeta Jones and be in the

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
the laser like making sure

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
that the lasers don't hit your boobies

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I'll go look at it

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
real quick and figure out what that was called

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I'm sorry the moment you said her name I started thinking of

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Dawn French impersonating her

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
really I think of T-Mobile commercials

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
have you ever seen

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
the French Insolence Show?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
yes because you've played it for me like a million times

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
yes

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Catherine Zeta Spartacus Douglas Jones

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
anyhow

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
no he's not my grandfather he's my husband

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
anyhow yes we need to do a Santa Cruz

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
boardwalk show that would be a lot of fun

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
anyhow moving on

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
talking about the Wii U

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
yes it seems like there's new Wii U news every week

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
and it's somebody reacting to it

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
this week it's Ubisoft is reacting to the Wii U

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
they must like it because it's

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
the whole console has a capital U just like their company

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
well they said

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Yves Guillemot

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
who is the Ubisoft CEO says

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
we feel this

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
console is coming with very innovative features

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
that will change the video game industry

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
and we want to be a part of that

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I love that you have a screen very close to you

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
you can get information and send it as well

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
but you don't have to learn

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
too many things

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I think it's sending the message that the new transition

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
is going to happen and we're going to have new machines

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
coming soon

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
that almost seems like a bad

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
translation to me

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
you get information and send it but you don't have to learn

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
too many things

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
well anyhow

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
speaking of Ubisoft there's been some

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
clarification if you will on Assassin's Creed

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
it is not a port

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
of Revelations

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
the game that is coming to the Wii U is an all new

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Assassin's Creed title

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
it was part of the little Nintendo announcement

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
they showed a clip of Assassin's Creed

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
but it's actually going to be an all

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
new title

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
that was clarified in the interview

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
so it's something new

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
who knows

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
could be Assassin's Creed 3

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
we'll see

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
but you'll have that

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
screen and you might be able to

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
keep some information secret

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
ok

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
sorry to go back to what I was

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
talking about before

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
it's a game called The Vault

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
and they have

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
a little bit of gameplay

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
that they're showing that's on TV

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
in the lobby or whatever but you have to

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
have these lights shining through and you have to dodge them

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
and they get to where the vault is in the back

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
it looks like fun

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
and they play, you can't hear it

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
but they have the Mission Impossible music playing

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
that actually looks kind of rad

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I'm not even going to lie, I kind of want to play that

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
but my fat ass would hit so many lasers

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
your gigantic

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
ass just set off five lasers

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
congratulations

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
moving on, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
before we get to release dates after this

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
well how about the

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
roster for Marvel vs. Capcom

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
how's that sound?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
it got leaked and Capcom's not denying it

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
so for Capcom we have Strider Here You

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Firebrand, Vergil

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Frank West, Phoenix Wright and Nemesis

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
OBJECTION

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
STARS

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
actually that is going to be reason alone

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Firebrand, to get the game and that's pretty awesome

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
that Strider is coming back

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Firebrand, that's awesome

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
that was also a bad guy in Ghost of the Goblins

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
but he had his own two series of games

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
that's right, what about Marvel

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Marvel we have Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Nova, Rocket Raccoon

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Hawkeye, yes

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
and Iron Fist, yes

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
two of my favorite characters on the Marvel side

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I'm happy and my favorite character

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
on the Capcom side, I'm happy

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
cause

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
well you know back in the day, Dan had

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
a website

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
called Neo Strider Strider Zone

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
he had

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
like old style like

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Geo Cities type old web page

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
and I did all the graphics for it back in the day

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
oh wow, when we first got together

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
and

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
so

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
we actually

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
he totally got me into the Strider games

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
but now I'm a big fan

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
of the

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
mostly A list but not quite A list

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
the pushing B plus list

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
of Marvel heroes

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
so like my favorite character of all time is Jessica Jones

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
which I know she's not gonna end up in a game but

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I can dream, but now I finally

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
get Hawkeye in a game

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
that isn't Captain America and the Avengers

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
and Iron Fist

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
who, Iron Fist in a fighting game just makes

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
sense, awesome

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
what do you think though about

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
the whole fact that they're putting out this ultimate

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Marvel vs Capcom 3 like not even

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
a year after the first game came out I mean

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
isn't that kinda

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
the game needed tweaking, it needed tweaking

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
it needed free tweaking

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
you know what I mean?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
like it just, I mean

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
you have to admit, this is why

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
people are pissed at Capcom right now about the whole

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Mega Man Legends 3 thing is that you know you get

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
this slap in the face and then you get this slap

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
in the face, I don't care I don't think it's a slap in the face

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I'm excited, it's a slap in the face if

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
you bought the original, I did buy the original and I

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
don't care I want this one too, really?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
yeah, I mean I don't know, Hawkeye

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I will say this, I bought Street Fighter 4

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
on Xbox 360 and then Super Street Fighter 4

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
is announced I'm like

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
alright well I'll get it on Playstation 3 cause at least

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I know it'll have a better controller

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and then, yeah and then the

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
arcade edition comes out so like another 15 bucks

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
but at least that wasn't like a

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
like a full, I mean I know it was a

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
full retail release but at least

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
it was compatible with Super Street Fighter

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
well they had, they had a DLC that

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
you could get that basically made it

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
to where, tournament stick, yeah

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
it was, worth the money

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
they should have done that type of stuff with

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Marvel vs Capcom 3 except

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
they decided hey you know we're gonna be assholes

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
and we're gonna put out each character for $5 each

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
um

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
no, well they only had two of them

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
this is actually, none of the

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
other characters are gonna be available as DLC

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
they've got Shumagrath and Jill included with

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
this one and then all of the rest of the characters

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
that I named

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I think I saw something come out of

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Comic Con about other

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
downloadable characters for the game though

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
they have costumes

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
alternate costumes

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I thought there were other characters that showed up at the

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Comic Con that were like download

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
content or something like that, could be wrong

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
well they've also added a spectator mode

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
and other new playable content

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
so basically they said

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
and this is a quote here from

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Nitsuma said that

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
there's about half and half between the original

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
download content, the planned download content

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
and the new content

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
so basically it's like you're getting

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
well

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I would look at it as

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
almost a new game

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
like half a new game

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
with everything else that's going

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
into it and honestly that's how I'm looking at it

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I mean you're getting as many new characters

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
as a new fighting game

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
so I guess that's true

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
at least it's down to 40 bucks too

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
so those of us who didn't buy the game the first time

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
like me, now have a reason to

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I look at it like a sort of Rock Band 3

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
you know

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
your old characters carry over

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
and you get some new ones, and new content

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
new modes

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
with Rock Band 3, all your

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
songs carry over, and you get

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
symbols, and new modes, and

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
harmony, and most importantly the keyboards

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
and keyboard, you get keyboard cap

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
yeah but I wouldn't exactly say it's

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
very similar to that because

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
why not it's exactly the same

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
why not because the original game is broken

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
they have issues that they need to fix

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
for the online multiplayer, and they're just like

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
eh, we don't want to do that, we're just going to release a new game

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Rock Band's got issues online

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
ok, but nothing to the point

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
that it's game breaking

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I mean, it's just

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I don't play online so I don't give a shit

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
they refuse to fix it, so they're just like

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
oh hey, but by the way, you should buy our new game

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
which very well can have problems of its own

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
fix it because they're going to release ultimate

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I don't play online, so I honestly personally

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I don't give a shit about the online play

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
well you may not give a shit, but there's a lot of people who do play online

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
and that's a big thing for them, and they do give a shit

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
then it's their problem

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I have no problem with it

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I believe it's gaffcom's problem

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
just a quick note for the live listeners only

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I don't know what happened, but Winamp crashed

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
so unfortunately you missed that little argument

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
so you'll have to tune into the podcast to hear that

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Loki and Dark Soccer just got in a little heated

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
discussion about that

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Loki was having an uncharacteristic

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
caring for other people

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
and I didn't give a shit

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
it's not uncharacteristic for me

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I care about other people

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
me, myself, and I

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
no, I'm just saying

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
the whole reason I understand

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
expanding and adding new features

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I think the last game I played online was Fable 2

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
on Xbox Live

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
ok, well then this stuff doesn't bother you

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
that's fine

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
but for people that do play online

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
and I guess I don't play this game online

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
but I empathize with those that do

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
they may be a little bit pissed at the fact that

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
instead of patching the game

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
to make it work like it's supposed to

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I'm sure there's going to be a patch

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
no, there will not be a patch

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
if they're going to announce a new game

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
why would they fix the old game

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I agree, the old game is done

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
now that they've announced this

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
there's nothing going to come of the old game

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
and back to this, it's not Capcom's fucking problem

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
people are going to pay for the game

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
they're going to sell it

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
because people love Marvel vs. Capcom 3

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
and I love Hawkeye

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
so I'm getting the game

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I have to say your Rock Band comparison

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
makes a lot of sense

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I still don't know

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
if I would really be happy that it's all happening

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
in the same year

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
but that was probably the best

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
argument I've heard for Capcom

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I can get why people are

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
messed up over it

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
but at the same time

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
they're going to make their money

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
it's not Capcom's problem

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
it's the consumer's problem

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and the only way it's going to be made

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
is if the consumer does not follow through

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
you're right, this isn't Capcom's problem

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
it wasn't Activision's problem

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
that DJ Hero 1 didn't have any download content

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
because they decided

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
instead of supporting it with download content

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
like we said we were

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
we're just going to, I don't know, put out a new game

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
so Loki, there were like 9 songs

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
you could download for DJ Hero 1

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
so, I mean, that was

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
9 pieces of download content

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
that you could get

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
or Konami and Dance Dance Revolution

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
you know, oh yeah

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
we're going to support this game

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I know we said we're going to support the last game

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
with download content, but I promise you

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
we're going to support this game with download content

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
and here's your

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
one piece of download content

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
you know, it's just like that

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and you may remember what happened

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
to Guitar Hero where there wasn't as much

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
download content, but hey, you know what, we released

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
these song packs, because that's what the fans

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
want, they want all their characters

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
and all this cool spectator mode

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
and alternate stuff, because you know what

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I really need an Elvis costume

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
for my fucking characters

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
that's really canon for

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Marvel, that's going to be really awesome

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
so

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
looking forward to it

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
oh, and by the way

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
not to nitpick here a little bit

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Capcom, but

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
your game, Street Fighter

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
versus Tekken, or Street Fighter

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
across Tekken, I know that you've added

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
other Capcom characters, they're not

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
part of Street Fighter, you need to change the fucking title

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
hey hey hey, I'm not to that story yet, you need to wait

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
you just sit and hold that rant

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
alright, we gotta go to some release dates

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
travel around the world

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
and talk about what's coming out to a store near you

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Loki, start here in the US

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
there's not much of anything coming out this week

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
it's pretty much

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Catherine

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
that's on PlayStation 3 and

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Xbox 360, and of course

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
they have the Love Is

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Something

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
some collector's edition that

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Love Is Something

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
how about Love Is Over?

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
yeah, Love Is Over

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
you can get that collector's edition that comes with

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
boxers and a t-shirt

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
that's pretty awesome

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
and then of course Pac-Man and Galaga

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
legions

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
how would they know what size boxers to put in there

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
there's only large

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
some Catherine fans are skinny, some are not so skinny

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
well, it's just large

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
the one size fits all

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
well better, you know, some people are larger

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
than large, so

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
you just have to

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
you just have to hang them on the wall

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
if you can't fit into them

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
fair enough

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
make your cat wear them

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
yes, Pac-Man and Galaga dimensions

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
so that's for the 3DS

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
uh

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
and the Sims 3 Town Life

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
stuff expansion is going to be coming out on

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
PC

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
that's literally

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
it, I mean, it's

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
that dead

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
well then let's go to the

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Xbox 360 in Japan and talk about what's coming

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
out there, on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Operation Flashpoint

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Red River comes out this week as well as Dungeon

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Siege 3 gets its Japanese

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
release this week, that's it on the 360

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
uh, those two games of course

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
on the 28th, going to the Playstation 3

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Dungeon Siege 3 there as well

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Operation Flashpoint there as well

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
and a game called Fit in 6

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Karada o Kichiro

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
6u no Yosu

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
comes out this week, which I believe is just

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
some type of like, like, Playstation

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Move XR Fitness game, that I guess

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
is a little more tailored

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I don't know if this is a game we have here, it's by

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Ubisoft, so I would

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Fit in 6, yeah, I came out back in March

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
oh, we have this here?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
shows how much attention I've been paying

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
to the PlayStation, which I still don't own

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I only know because I set

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
these items up, so

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
alright, then there you go

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
going to, I wanna see if there's anything on the handhelds

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
real quick, or maybe anything in Nintendo's world

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
the Sony PSP

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
has

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Queensgate Spiral Chaos

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
comes out this week in regular and limited

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
or I guess like a special edition

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Queensgate is a RPG

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
become the queen of a dimension

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
harness the power of the queens gate

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
the door that connects to all game worlds

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
is taken over by someone evil and

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
ambitious, this game includes

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Mai from King of Fighters

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
and the ladies from Queensblade

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
so this is kinda like a world's

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
collide type of game, where there's

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
other chicks from other series

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
and it looks like a farting maid

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
that's what that looks like to me in that picture

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
doesn't look like she's going poot

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
and it says hip, look at that

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
who farts with the sound hip

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
hip!

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
cause she's swinging her hip, she's going poot

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
with her hip, could be one of those loud

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
wine poops, you know

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
okay, that's plenty enough

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
hey, I just made it with my mouth

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Fit and Six also coming out on the Wii in Japan

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
if you care, on the 3DS

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Super Pokemon Scramble, I remember

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
mentioning that last week, finally a Pokemon game

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
on the 3DS, even though it's not, you know,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
the Pokemon game, it's

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Pokemon Dynasty Warriors

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and lastly

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
on the Nintendo DS, Devil Survivor 2

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
from Atlus this week

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
on the regular DS, non-3D flavor

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
alright, how about the UK?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
we have a few things

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
we have on the 26th, Call of Juarez

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
the Cartel for PC

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
and Dragon Age 2 Legacy

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
for PS3, PC

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Xbox 360

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
and on the 27th, Project Dust

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
from Ubisoft on Xbox 360

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
that's about it

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
a couple more news stories for you guys

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
and then the classic game of the week, but first

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
but first, uh

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
there was a person that had

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
the domain for modernwarfare3.com

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
um

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
they were

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
somewhat anonymous via

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
GoDaddy's domains by proxy

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
hiding surface

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
we use that by the way

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
for our own website

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
apparently a domain dispute

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
from Modern Warfare 3's publisher

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Activision

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
has dissolved that shield

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
it is now apparently

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
known that it is owned by

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
a guy from Florida named Anthony

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Abram and

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
he is now

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
doing a bunch of random things with the website

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
including, he was at one

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
time redirecting it to Battlefield 3's

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
main site and also

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
spoofing

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Modern Warfare 3's official

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
site and um

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
you know, making videos

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
that are saying that Modern Warfare 3 is

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
crap and blah blah blah

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
the publisher of course Activision believes

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
that Abram has

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
no right or legitimate

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
interest in the domain name and

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
argues that it's entitled to control

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
given its history with the Modern Warfare

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
IP. Yeah I love how that's

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
granted that this guy, yeah he is

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
a troll and he is

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
the domain name because he knows that

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Activision is going to have a Modern Warfare 3

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
game at some point. That being

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
said, I still think he should have the website

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
and just because

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Activision has a game

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
for example if I

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
register a website that's like

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I don't know

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
awesomesauce.com

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
or something like that and let's just assume

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
that there's no such thing as awesomesauce

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
some person out there decides

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
hey you know what,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Heinz57 is going to come out with

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
awesomesauce and we want

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
that domain. You give it to

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
us because we want it.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I don't think that because you want something

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
in your company that you should get that.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I mean

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I think that you should have registered

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
that domain a long time ago then.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Because you know, Activision

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I don't know what to tell you but

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
back when you were doing Modern Warfare 2

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I could have told you that there was going to be a Modern Warfare 3

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
and I mean

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
that's just dumb.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
He should have done the

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
smarter thing and he should have had

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
some type of club or something

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
that was like the name Modern Warfare

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
or something if he wanted to be smarter about it.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Like for instance, I remember this

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
reading about this, the guy who owns

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
or at least did own, I don't know if he still

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
does, I haven't checked it in years but

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
sting.com, the musician

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Sting tried to sue the guy who owns it

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
because he wanted the domain because he is

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
the celebrity Sting. He is

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
you know, he knows that name.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
But the guy who owned the domain

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
wasn't trying to troll Sting. He wasn't

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
holding the domain for Sting asking for

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
hundreds of dollars. He was some type of

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
he was either a gamer or something

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
where like that was his handle. And that's what he was

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
known as in the online community. He was Sting

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
for whatever reason. Like he just had

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
nothing to do with the musician. What if he had been the wrestler

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Sting? Perhaps he was, I don't know.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Well the internet foundation

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
or whatever actually found in favor of the guy

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
that he had every right to the

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
name that if Sting wanted it he should have got it first.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And you know, and I think to

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
the argument of this guy, Modern Warfare 3

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
that's not the title

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
of the game. That's the subtitle of the game.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
It's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
You know, it's not like Hello Kitty

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Modern Warfare 3. It's

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Call of Duty. That is, you know

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
if he had his website was

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
yeah I think there's a problem there because

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
now you're infringing on, you know, the intellectual

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
properties of Activision.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
But this is just trolling. It's just like

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
whitehouse.com. It's a porn site.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Or it was a porn site.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
You know, too fucking bad.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
If the White House

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
can't get a god damn URL

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
then Activision should

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
not get a god damn URL.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
But if the guy was just

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
trolling and has no legitimate purpose

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
to have that title.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Just like these people, like

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
some person sat on JuliaRoberts.com

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
and tried to basically

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
sell it back to her for like

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
$10,000. That's just

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
that's just embezzlement. But he's not doing that.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
He's just being an asshole. Or not embezzlement.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And you know what? He has the right to be an asshole

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
on the internet. And you know what?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
I don't think he does.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I think in this case. If he has no

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
legitimate purpose for holding that website

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I don't think he

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I'm just saying he wasn't smart about how he

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
used it. He should have used it. If he wanted

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
to he could have had a dissertation about

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
how Modern Warfare 3 is going to be a

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
terrible game or how to be a review on

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Modern Warfare 3 and I think he would have had more

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
of a say. I don't know.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
It just, you know, I think

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
if you're not going to use it for anything

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
worthwhile, there's that

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
committee that'll say, you bring nothing good

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
to the internet. We're shutting you down.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
SSJ100Matt fuck you in the chat. Yes

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
he changed his name to that. Says, I'm

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
going to register OrangelaungeRadio2.com.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Well, okay.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Here's what

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Modern Warfare 2's official website

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
ModernWarfare2.InfinityWar.com

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Oh, well I guess

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I can't use that anymore.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Oh, damn.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
But I mean, they have a CallOfDuty.com

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
They can easily do a CallOfDuty

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
slash ModernWarfare3 or

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
they can do Mw3 since that's how

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
it's displayed on the box. I mean

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
there's plenty of

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
things out there. What if

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
What's on that website right now if you try to

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
go to it? What if he went to Modern

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
if he did ModernWarfare3.net

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
or something like that? Is that going to still

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
be an issue? I'm going to the website right now. If this

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
auto plays anything. Oh no, it's just

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
a totally blank page.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
No source code or nothing.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
There you go.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Thank you. Sturlock

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
rescue me. Extorting. Why couldn't I think of

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
that word? Extorting money out of her.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
That's what they were trying to do to Julia Roberts. Thank you.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Minute and a half later. Thank you buffer.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
If your Activision just

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
like seriously, who cares?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I mean look at like the ModernWarfare2.com

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
was a website

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
and you know it's a ModernWarfare2

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
fan site or something.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I mean if like if I came out

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
what if I go and register

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
ModernWarfare4.com

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
What are they going to do?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
But

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
I'm going to put some stupid articles about Modern

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Warfare like you know hey there's guns.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
You should go register

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
MegaManLegends3.com right now since you

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
know no one else is going to use it now.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Do they

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
is there a MegaManLegends3.com

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
hold on.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Sorry for the dead air but I have to check.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Oh no somebody's

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
holding it. It's a troll holding

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
it saying this website's for sale by

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
owner and it's just a bunch of links.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
That's been going on though since

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
the early dot com

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
business days too. Oh yeah.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
There's nothing new. Those guys

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
need to be tossed out immediately.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Like if I show that I have a legitimate business

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
purpose for those guys

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
need to get tossed. And here's ModernWarfare4.com

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
with a clown on it.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
It says welcome to ModernWarfare4.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
website. It would appear that Infinity Ward

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
forgot to purchase this domain. No worries

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
we have good

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
of course they have no spelling.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
We have good care of it.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Is this an extortion plot too?

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Are we breaking the

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
story here that there is

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
this whole time there's been a ModernWarfare4.com

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
You've all been

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
focused on ModernWarfare3 all

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
week? Well there's a ModernWarfare4

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
out there. There's not a five

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I'm gonna register five.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
ModernWarfare5 that's mine.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Go get it quick.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Use a GoDaddy

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
registration code to do that. Oh wait

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
we're not sponsored by GoDaddy.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
That would be hilarious.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Go ahead.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Take the domain.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Could

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
someone register would somebody be willing to spend

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
the twenty bucks to register ModernWarfare5.com

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
It's not even twenty bucks it's ten. Ten dollars.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Really? Ten dollars. What would we point

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
it to if we bought ModernWarfare5.com

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
right now? What would we point it to? The

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Ooga Booga site. No.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
We can make some really

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
fake looking box art or something.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Nerf fan site.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Modern Warfare with Nerf.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
It's Nerf and Nerf.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Would you be willing to post for pictures

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
modeling with the Nerf bats and so forth?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
No. You haven't seen Dan's bucket

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
of Nerf. And that could be our

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
little, see we shouldn't say this on the

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
podcast though cause now somebody's registering it right

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
now as we speak. But what it could be

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
I'm cool with you doing that as long as you

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
give it to us cause what we need to do

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
we need to have our Nerf club called the

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Modern Warfare club and it's just us clubbing

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
each other with Nerf bats and stuff.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Well I've actually got not just

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
the Nerf sword, the broadsword

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I have the axe and the mace.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
And we have a bunch of Nerf guns.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
A lot of Nerf guns.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
And the orange bat.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Nice.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
What about StreetFighter5.com?

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
No.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
No because Capcom won't have that out for another ten years.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Ah see ActDeft I love

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
that thought. ActDeft says redirect

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
it to President Cat.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
A plus.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Send it to the Renowee Twitter.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Why not?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I like that.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
That's actually a really good idea. I like that.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Easm said it should go to the

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
NRA. Let's put it this way.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
If Professor Genki is so popular

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
in Saints Row 3 President Cat should

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
easily be able to come out over here.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Alright but just

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
a footnote and word of warning.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
If you register Modern Warfare 5 and give it to us

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
to put our pictures of Nerf fights on

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
if you get sued that's on you.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Like I disavow every knowledge

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
that this conversation ever happened.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
SSJ100MattFuckYou says

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Rob we really should register a Dance Dance Revolution

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
site and see if Konami gives a shit.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Wouldn't mind trolling them.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Here's a better one. What if you did it as

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
COD Modern Warfare 5

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
and you're fighting with CODs

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
like fish.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Like actual trout

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
snapping IRL.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Like M-I-R-C.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
It could just be pictures. Sky slaps

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Dark Sakura with a trout and it would

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
be actually me slapping her with a trout.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
That would be hilarious.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
That would not be hilarious.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
That would be smelly.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Alright moving on. Speaking of smelly

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
no I got nothing. We got

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
actually this might be kind of smelly. You know the character

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Poison from Fatal

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
or excuse me Final Fight. You mean the

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
transgender? Is she

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
really? Yes.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Is this transgender? Yes it actually

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
is officially said on

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
like way back in an old

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
interview with one of the game designers.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
It was supposed to be because

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
they couldn't make her a woman in the game

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
because it wasn't right to hit a woman

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
so that's why they made her

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
a man.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And then they changed the character sprite

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
in the US. And I think in other

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
places they gave her a longer skirt and covered

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
up her boob. But yeah

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
officially Poison is

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
supposed to be transgendered.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Well guess what? You're going to kick some tranny ass

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
in Street Fighter versus

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Tekken or you can kick ass as

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
a tranny. It's equal opportunity.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
It is available there.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
It's going to be Poison is one

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
of the characters there as well as

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
what else was announced here?

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Dalsim and then from Tekken

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Steve Fox and Yoshimitsu.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Dude Steve Fox was kind of fun. All announced as

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
characters. I wonder if Poison would whip out her dick

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000
and smack people.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Special attack surprise!

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I'm all for a diverse character line up in the game

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
but here's the thing.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Is that if it's Street Fighter cross Tekken

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
she's a Final Fight character

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
and okay I get it like Guy

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Cody they kind of crossed over too

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
but does that mean everybody

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
from Final Fight is now part of the Street Fighter

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
canon? Then why can't Poison be

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
in Ultimate Marvel

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
versus Capcom 3?

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Maybe a download character.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
I don't know. It just

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
seems like a strange pick

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
to me with so many characters in the Street Fighter

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
universe but okay. They want to

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
bring back or maybe they just

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
somebody really wants to put. It's because they're super

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom 3.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
See you know what sucks is now I have

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
that song running through my head.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
That Bill Biv DeVoe song.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Good lord.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Alright.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Moving on.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Yeah that was at a panel by the way at Comic Con

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
2011 where it was announced that those

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
characters would be in the game

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
and I guess

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Hugo, Cody, and Guy

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
have also been teased for the game.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Well that would make sense if

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Poison's in it that Guy and Cody are going to show up at some point

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
as well. Gosh I wonder how many characters

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
this game is supposed to have.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
It's crazy.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
So there you go. All characters

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
that are set to come out in Street Fighter cross

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Tekken which is a game that I'm

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
pretty excited about actually.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
It should be like Andori

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
who was actually based off of Andre the Giant.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Oh yeah?

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
But they changed his name because of the state.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Oh right. I remember

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
those characters that look just like

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Andre the Giant.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Funny.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Alright. Let's move on to the

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
classic game of the week.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Yay. Every week

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
here on Orange Launch Radio we like to take a

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
trip down memory lane. Where's my theme music?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Have I lost the theme music?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
This is

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
a big deal.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Where's the theme music?

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
There we go.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Yay. This is going to be a very bad

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
mood if I couldn't hear this happy music. Anyway

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
the classic game of the week is a chance for us to walk

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
down memory lane and check out

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
a game that Dark Soccer

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
thinks hey you kids should be playing this game

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
right now. Good luck finding one.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Well

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
regardless here it is your classic game of the week.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
The classic game

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
of the week is Planet Harriers

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
which I brought up

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
at the beginning of the show and I've

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
brought up constantly throughout past shows

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I'm finally reviewing it because dammit

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
this game is awesome.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
But it is

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
part of the Space Harrier series and it has a

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
twin cabinet so two people can play at the same

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
time or you can do a networked

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
two player game and

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
you actually play seated

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
and it's controlled through a joystick

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
and a missile and a bullet trigger

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
and you can change your views and you have

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
bomb buttons all on the main panel.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
So you can choose either four characters.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
It's Glenn, X, Cory or Nick

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
and basically they

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
fly on the screen and you are

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
behind them so it's

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
that sort of

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
third

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
person style but not

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
quite. And then in two player

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
mode you actually can dock together to save

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
your life and it has the opa opa in it

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
because you cannot have a game

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
in the fantasy zone without the opa

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
opa.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
So

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
this game, a little bit more information

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
about it is that it actually

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
was

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
on the

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
kakaru system which

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
was basically a double mountain

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
and you can

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
you don't play versus you play

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
as a team to clear off the screen and your joystick

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
is an eight way stick

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
and it's stereo sound

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
and the game came out in 2001

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
and you know the last place that I saw one at

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
was at Great America when we went

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
to see Margaret Cho.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
They had that there? They had that there.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Wow. That's pretty cool.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
And I remembered because

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
oh the female character that

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
you can play basically she wears

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
a nurse's outfit and shoots a giant

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
syringe as her weapon.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
But it's also cool because the final boss

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
in this game will

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
turn into a variety of different shapes

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
like it'll be a fish or waves

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
and one of the things it turns into is the Dreamcast logo.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
The little squirrel.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
But yeah I mean it's basically

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
you know you

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
have obstacles in your way and

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
when you're actually on the ground you're

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
running on the ground like in Space Harrier

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
but when you're in the air you're shooting

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
and it's got great music

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
it's got great graphics for 2001

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
and it only ever came out in the arcade

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
there was a talk of them doing a

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Dreamcast port. Never happened.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Which I don't see

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
why they didn't because it would be super easy

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
given you know

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
how the Dreamcast is basically

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
now me.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
The other thing that I liked about this one too and it's actually the part

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
that you just got to on Video Rob is it has

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
a shop like in

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Fantasy Zone.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I was going to say it reminds me of Fantasy Zone.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Yeah so you can go in and you buy like

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
big bombs or more speed or

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
more shield

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
and you use it to power yourself up as you go along

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
because you're also collecting

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
your points and your money

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
as you go along too.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
So it's just a really neat game

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
and they didn't

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
really I think make a whole lot of them

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
and it kind of died out so

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
there's no home version of this.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Now I've been trying

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
to find it emulated and from

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
what I understand

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
what was it that I downloaded today?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Apparently

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
the main

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
.14164

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
bit runs it but I

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
don't think very well.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I haven't been able to find much more else about

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
the emulation but really that's the only way

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
you're probably going to be able to play it unless you have to

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
know where one is and if you know where one is

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
tell me so that I can go play it.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I was so pissed off when we went to the

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Sega Arcade in Seattle to Gameworks

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
and they did not have a Planet Harrier.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
How could they not have a Planet Harriers?

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
They should just we need to have

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
a set release called

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
The Ultimate Fantasy Zone

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
which is all the Fantasy Zone games including

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Fantasy Zone The Maze and Space Harrier

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
and Planet Harriers.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Oh you could also

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
you also did have a bonus of characters

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
in there but I did not remember how to get them.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I thought you were going to buy the former Sunrise Fun

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Center and make it your bitch and you were

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
going to put all these great games in that place.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
You know what? When I have money

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I'll be doing that.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
So maybe in

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
2035.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
But that is the classic game.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
There it is. Planet Harrier.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Your classic plastic game of the week.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
The seat is plastic.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Your classic game

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
of the week. Alright we got plenty

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
more show to go but don't go anywhere.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
We're going to be right back after this quick break

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
including more news on things like Minecraft

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
and Child of Eden on the

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Playstation 3 and then we're going to talk about

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
getting sued. Good times.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Of course your calls and

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
so excited. A list list tonight.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Yay. So we're going to do a list

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
list tonight when we come back with more of

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Welcome back everybody to

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
episode number 421 of

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Orange Lounge Radio. Live on this

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
July the 24th of 2011

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
as we are live of course every

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
week Sunday nights at All Games Radio

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
www.allgames.com

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
and there's lots of great stuff.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
If you can't tune in on Sunday nights you should listen to

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
allgames.com throughout the week. There's a lot of other great shows

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
many of them live that tape

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
throughout the week so check that out.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I thought before we get into part B in the

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
news tonight I wanted to touch on this story.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
This is something that Salacious Pop brought to my

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
attention this week and I

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
thought for sure Dark Sakura

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
of all people might have a perspective

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
on this one so I'm going to kind of blindside

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
her a little bit with this story. Yeah. Because

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
this has to do with women

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
kind of. Let me explain.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Okay I'm equipped. Alright.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Well sort of. Wait till I get to this.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Okay. So Kotaku ran this story earlier this

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
week. This is something that Salacious Pop

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
emailed me and the title is called

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Well That's One Way to Combat

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Misogyny in Gaming.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
And what it's basically getting at is that there's a

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
large LAN party that happens in Texas

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
and it's being organized to celebrate

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
the launch of Battlefield 3.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Which is you know this big game that's being launched

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
and so forth. They've decided that the best

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
way to deal with slurs

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
that end up getting hurled at

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
female gamers at these events

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
is to just prevent women from attending.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
So no women will be allowed

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
to attend this event in

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Texas. Let me read a

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
quote from the FAQ. Hold on. Hold on.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Quote

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Nothing ruins a good LAN party

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
like a woman. No that's not the quote.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Okay. Nothing ruins a good

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
LAN party like uncomfortable guests

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
or lots of tension.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Both of which can result from mixing

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
immature misogynistic male gamers

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
with female counterparts.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Though we've done our best to avoid these

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
situations in years past, we've

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
certainly had our share of problems.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
As a result we no longer allow

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
women to attend the event.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Now

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
thoughts so far before I read the

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
update. I will be fair. This paragraph

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
has since been changed but let's

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
let's hear dark soccer's initial reaction.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
If they're a private organization

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
and

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
then they do have

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
the right as a private

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
organization. However

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
you

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
have the right to call them dickheads.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Well

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
it just goes back to lower

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
my impression of Texas.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
People

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
do not have any logic

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
in the south and I can say this because I'm

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
there. It's like

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
very few people

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
think

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
outside of

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
the box. Just go for

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
well this will be the easy way we just won't have

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
chicks there huh? Well for this whole weekend they

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
will all be thinking outside of the box

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
because there will be no boxes at this

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
event if you know what I mean.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Well this is why

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
sorry that this

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
is why male

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
geeks get a bad rep.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
You are afraid

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
of us. And so

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
when we kick your ass you have to

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
resort to name calling.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Like you do with

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
when some noob kicks your ass.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
It's just immaturity

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
is all it is. They just name call everybody

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
and it's the women that get upset

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
about it.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Maybe if women would cry less they

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
get invited to these events.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Well no I think the whole thing is that

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
you know it would be

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
exactly the same if it were two guys okay.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
You have guy one going oh you stupid slut

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
and she goes oh yeah you dumb prick.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
You know instead you have like you asshole

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
bitch. Well I'm going to

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
tell you this. I'm going to tell you this.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
It's not going to stop

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
that whole and you can't tell me this

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
doesn't happen in Texas.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
You kill me stop being such

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
a fag. You're being a fag.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
You're a little fag right now and

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
I guarantee you

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
in a room like that there's going to

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
be at least one.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Who passed the penis check.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
And the other thing too if you got to

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
complain about people killing you in a

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
death match where the point is to kill

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
each other

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I don't I don't understand why are you killing

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
me. Why are you killing me because it's

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
the point of the game. I'm calling for

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
infiltration.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Infiltration. Women women

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
run in stampede.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Burn your bras. No.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I'm calling for

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
chick drag. Chick drag.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
You know what exists. Oh yeah

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
oh god. I was I was at the bar

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
one night with friends with a birthday

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
celebration. We got there a little early and we walked

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
right in on a drag king show. I kid you not

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
and that's what you'd

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
expect. I was some drag kings and some nice butch

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
lesbians to go in. It was it was very

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
butch. It was

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
not it was it wasn't sassy like

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
drag queens are you know. Drag queens are

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
very sassy. Because drag queens are taking

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
the ultimate of

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
the feminine mystique

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
and playing playing

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
it all of it up. So that's the same thing for

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
drag kings that they take the boring

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
dude-ness and make it more boring and

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
dudely. Alright going to the chatroom

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
at chat.org.com tons of comments in chat

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
here. Act Dev says they should ban the immature

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
people instead of women. Breakman

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
says nothing ruins. Everyone in Texas.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Nothing ruins a good sausage fest like

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
a woman.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Um

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
uh let's see

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
going uh what's this uh

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
laha says this is why we can't have nice

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
things. Frisbee says

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
this isn't the south this is Texas.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Alright look to be fair there was an update. They did remove that paragraph and here's what happened.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000
They're saying this event is a gentleman's retreat.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Quote we actively discourage gamers from being the kind of misogynistic jack wagon seen in the reddit post and such

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
behavior should not be tolerated.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Frankly we don't like that kind of

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
player either. So far as this event

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
goes it's a special event designed

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
specifically for male gamers.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Further it is meant as a getaway

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
designed to help said male

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
contingent become better men

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
both for themselves and for those who love

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
us.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Yeah that's more bullshit.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
I gotta tell ya

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
I gotta tell ya

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
I've never been to no I was in Texas

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
once for like five minutes. For the few smart

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
people in Texas like Travis

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
you're not on the

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
stupid list. Yes. Most everybody

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
else is on the stupid list. I know I know plenty

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
of smart people in Texas and there's

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
some that listen to this show actually. It's just

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
it's like Jeff Foxworthy says

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
when it comes time to talk about the south

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
the news always points out the

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
least common denominator.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
You know. Here's the

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
thing I gotta admit there's a part

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
of me that's a little bit tempted since it

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
is an all male retreat.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
It's only forty nine bucks

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
maybe I should go and

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
maybe I should flame it up a little bit.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
You know what. I

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
heard there was a retreat.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Oh my god

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
we're gonna play some battlefield.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I loves battlefield.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
He just shot you in the head

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
what a stupid bitch.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
There's a small

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
part of me that wants to even though I would

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
I would play up to every negative stereotype

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I'm sure these guys already have like I just

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
you know there's that part of me that just

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
wants to ruin

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
their day. Now here's my idea.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
One

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
you either have the infiltration go

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
on have a woman beat

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
all the guys asses and go oh by the way here's my

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
boobs. Or

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
the ladies have their own counter retreat.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Say fine

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
you're not inviting us bitches you're not

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
allowed.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
And

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
some interesting comments from chat here

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Black Wolf says are they also telling

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
black people to stay home. No

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
race is not a part of this.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
So they're just sexist not racist.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
They're just sexist and I'm

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
gonna just guess with

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
nothing to back me up also homophobic.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Duh it's Texas.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
And maybe a little bit racist but I don't know

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
but no we're not seeing any apparent

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
racism going on here. Okay.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Salacious Pop says Loki I feel

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
that women who opt into participating in that

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
first person shooter culture know what they're getting into

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
to a point but neckbeards realize

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
this and decide to escalate it until it

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
becomes pretty disgusting and unacceptable

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
no matter what kind of game it is and a line just

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
gets crossed. And you should be able to shit

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
talk without going the gender race

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
gay route. It just means you're not very

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
articulate. Aha

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
become a smarter cut lower

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
person.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
There you go. You just need to be smarter

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
about your

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
cut downs.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
But I mean and I'm

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
and this

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
is why I say this and people

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
smart people in the south will know what I'm

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
talking about is that

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
that's just it just is like

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
typical. It's just

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
typical.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Black Wolf in our chatroom says devil's advocate

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
there are plenty of female only

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
LAN events and that's empowering girl

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
gamers.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
True. But you you don't

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
want to backpedaling here a little

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
bit. So it makes it know that they have

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
the frag dolls and the reason why

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
they're doing well team

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
so they don't they don't

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
allow man in the frag dolls at all. Like if I try

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
to be a frag doll I couldn't do it.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Yeah you go ahead and play your first

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
person shooters step into Grand Theft

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Auto and we'll own your

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
but

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
but the whole the whole point is just

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
that it's it's really

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
and break man is asking us to stop hating

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
on the neck beards please. He has

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
a neck beer and he's feeling a little offended right now so

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
that we need to stop being neck beer

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
phobic. Hey

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
ZZ top.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
All right. But but my

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
point is

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
this is shit that I've run into

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
all the time when I lived in Alabama.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Like

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I could be the

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
my geek knowledge far

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
exceeded any of the guys

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
but you know

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
we're doing a guy party sorry.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Fuck you.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
I just kicked your ass

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
at this game yesterday is that why I'm not going?

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
No comment.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Yeah. All right look

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I just wanted to bring that up at some point.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I didn't mean to you know dominate our show with that

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
talk but I thought it would be an interesting little

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
aside. We do have a list list coming up

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
later this hour so stay tuned for that

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
and also we're

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
going to get into the rapid fire news

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
but I got to do quick plugs for other shows

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000

is the website and

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
yeah all the information and then some

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
you could stomach on the World of Warcraft

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Has anyone

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
guessed it on any podcast or anything this week?

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Yes!

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
What did you guess on this week? Well as I said last week

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
I'm on two episodes

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
of Pop Culture Parlay

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Ah you did an episode arc. Yes.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Which you can go to

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
geek-life.com and download

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
or go on iTunes. There you go.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Ta da! All right check that out. Pop Culture Parlay

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
I did listen to a little bit of that first episode

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
you were on while I was driving to the store

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
or something. And I was recently on Girls

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Gone Well. So you can look back for that

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
episode too. The Mystery Third

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
podcast I'm hoping will be a reality very

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
soon. We've just had some

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
We're Too Busy setbacks going on and

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
knowing my week next week that's

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
not going to get any better so we'll see what happens

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
I'm busy Monday Tuesday Wednesday so

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Busy busy bee

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
So hopefully we'll get that

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
together. There is a third podcast coming

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
It's not going to

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
be like a huge thing. It will be like

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
30 minutes tops a week

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Brakeman suggests you go as Captain Sassy Pants

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
We'll see

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
So yeah

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
that's to look forward to and then

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
also speaking of like guesting on shows and stuff

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
I just want to kind of throw that out there like

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
you know if you have a podcast or your own

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
show I've heard some

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
people say like oh well I would

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
ask you to be on the show but my show is just

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
this little little show that's

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
nothing nothing serious and you know

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I never wanted to ask you guys because I'm too shy

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Dude if I have the time

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
I will gladly come on any show

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
like as long as your show isn't you know

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
like negative

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
about like as long as I'm not walking into a

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
show that's all like homophobic trash talking

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
and stuff like that but you know what I mean like if you're

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
generally generally an intelligent person

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
that's all I ask I'm gonna

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I'd be happy to guest on any show

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Me too. The size of this show is not

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
that large so don't

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
don't feel like you can't ever approach us

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
No size isn't what matters it's girth

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
the west coast and for a lot of and I'm on Twitter

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Dark Sakura oh yeah Twitter is a great way to get

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
a hold of us too that's how it still got a hold of me so

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
excellent yeah so there you go

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
we're always happy to come and you know

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
we're approaching our tenth year of podcasting

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
and we want it to be a big fucking deal

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
so especially come next year

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
we're going to try and go on as many shows as we can

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
so we're always happy to do that

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
anyhow so I want to say give us more stuff to plug

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
at the top of part B

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
until our third podcast launches

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
alright let's get into some rapid

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
fire news some news that

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
we just didn't have time to cover elsewhere

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
uh yes of course

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
there's some more details now

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
out about the 360

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
port of Minecraft

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
this is coming from Notch

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
of course the guy behind Minecraft

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
and saying there's actually going to be

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
marketing for the Xbox 360 version

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
of Minecraft so I've agreed

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
to be slightly less transparent

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
than usual when it comes to that

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
version and

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
basically saying that there's going to be some

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
cool stuff in there including

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
there's completely different crafting

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
and that the Kinect functionality

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
will include a mode where you have to wave your arms

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
around to mine and

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
use items it's just too silly not to

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
include and also

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
can you actually flail as you're running away from the ghost?

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
ah!

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
uh

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
that's what I'm going to do at the gentleman's retreat

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
for Battlefield by the way don't shoot me

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I don't know about that

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
basically

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
he also said that there's of course

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
the Xperia Play version of Minecraft

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
that's going to be coming out

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
for $7 sometime this

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
fall and

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
I guess it'll make it

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
it's programmed in a way that'll make it easy to port to all sorts

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
of mobile phones

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
so that's kind of neat

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
so I'm sure we'll hear more

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
details as we get closer to its

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
release I'm sure it'll be pretty big

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
um if you

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
just love Valve and you really want

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
to get your hands on some Valve action

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
figures and other stuff

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
well you're going to wait until 2012

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
but toy company NECA

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
they have revealed their lineup at

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Comic Con um including

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
a bunch of different franchises starting with Half Life 2

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
you can be able to get a Gordon Freeman action

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
figure uh Team Fortress 2

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
you can get a Pyro Heavy and Demo

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
action figure and also

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
they have Left 4 Dead the Boomer and

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Smoker action figures and finally

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
for Portal 2 Atlas

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
and Peabody action figures as well

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
as a replica um

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
portal gun um and a resin

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
and plush

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
weighted companion cube

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
so portal gun

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
that's going to be pretty awesome

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I'm telling you though

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
NECA um

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
if you really want to impress me

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
you'll do full size turret

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
bots

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
they come in the box do they sing

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
because if that's the case I kind of want one

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
will it randomly

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
just go are you still there?

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
you may remember that I am still working on my paper

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
craft turret that is full size

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
I do remember that

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
occasionally when I'm not working

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
on my Grand Theft Auto stuff I'll be working on that

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
it looks nice

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
it will be uh large

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
alright can't wait for you to

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
bring that to the show are you going to bring that to episode 500?

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
yeah sure

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
um and then finally um

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Grasshopper manufacturing is putting out

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
a new game it was featured

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
in Famitsu Magazine

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
and it is

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
straight up Grasshopper

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
um Lollipop

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Chainsaw is the new game it's going to be

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
coming out on Playstation 3 and 360

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
it is basically a game about

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
a cheerleader raised by zombie hunters

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
who uses her acrobatic training

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
and chainsaws to destroy zombies

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
wasn't that a side plot

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
in Jurassic Park 2?

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
where that acrobat little girl

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
like kicked the dinosaur in the face

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
yeah they said that was retarded

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
this looks awesome

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
hey hey hey you said you're not going to use that word anymore

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
yeah whatever

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
so this should be pretty awesome

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
they have some screenshots up for it

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
she's got a chainsaw

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
with hearts on it and she's killing zombies

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
so um it sounds to me

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
almost a little bit like Oni Chambara

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
um just

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
hopefully plays a lot better

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
and of course

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
a Kiriyamaoka working on the sound

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
nice

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
so all good

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
that would have made the Jurassic Park 2

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
a lot better if Kiriyamaoka had done the soundtrack

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
did you hear there's by the way a confirmed

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Jurassic Park 4 is in development

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
they want to bring that back

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I loved those movies when I was a kid at least the first one

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I think the plot of them you know

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
somehow making it to mainland

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
and kind of spreading would be pretty awesome

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
no because that's what happened at the end of the second movie

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
and it was terrible that's what made that movie so bad

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
no what made it bad

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
is just they have a feature of the T-Rex

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
I'm talking about like you know where

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
it's years later where they're multiplying

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
and coming out in small towns

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
and stuff they have the planet of the dinosaurs

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
you know track them down

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
alright anyhow moving on with other rapid fire news

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Team Fortress 2 whatever happens with big games

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
they get demade that's right

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
a demake has come out of Team Fortress 2

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
it's now a 2D beat em up

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
uh it's one guy

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
running his own development house Eric Ruth

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
from Team Fortress 2

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Team Fortress Arcade is the name of the game

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
it's an old school side scrolling beat em up

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
each character that's from Team Fortress

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
has weapons and ability that are similar to

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
it's class in Team Fortress 2

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
for example the Demoman can blast out sticky bombs

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
and explode whenever he does the jumping

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
engineerings can do upgrades

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
with the wrench and so forth

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
there's actually some hands on sessions

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
that have been reviewed on around the internet

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
and there's even a little YouTube there

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
that I guess some site did

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
review and you can actually I think he's probably

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
talking over this but let me see if he get

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
yeah he talks over that

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
but you can actually see here in studio we can see the

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
kind of gameplay emotion it looks like

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
that old school kind of 2D fighter it looks kind of fun

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
and Eric Ruth you may remember is the same guy

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
did all the demakes of like you know

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
all the NES things oh really

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
like the Left 4 Dead so this guy's a

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
pro hero yeah this guy's a pro

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
good uh and also announced a

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
comic con this week an R2D2

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Xbox 360 that's right is

an Xbox 360 bundle coming with

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
a white Kinect and a white

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Xbox 360 that is kind of skinned

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
so to speak to look like

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
a R2D2

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
like little vents and so forth

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I thought it was kind of neat it looks really cute

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
and of course it comes with Kinect Star Wars

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
that cause it looks really bad but I'm

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
it could be fun we'll see

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
I really hope THQ brings Saints Row 3

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
with them we'll see

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
I really want them I am

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
upset with Act of Death right now why

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
for mentioning horchata and I really want some now

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
horchata's are delicious

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I know they have places

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
open 24 hours that sell horchata's

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
if we can't get pinkberry

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
horchata and a taco

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
alright I don't know

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
this shows running late tonight alright we'll see

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
anyhow

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
this news is not quite as awesome as the

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
horchata but it's very

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
what is this going on here

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
ok remember Mortal Kombat and the download characters

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Mortal Kombat and we knew for

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
quite some time that there was going to be

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Kenshi there was going to be

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Scarlet and Rain we knew those

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
three characters for quite some time but

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Warner Brothers really kept the

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
fourth character under wraps for a long

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
time well the fourth character was revealed

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
this week the fourth download character

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
from Mortal Kombat is going to be

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
not Tanya not

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Meat it's going to be Freddy Krueger

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
to which a lot of people kind of went

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
what kind of want

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
like I think that was the reaction

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
most of my friends was like ok

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
it's kind of cool I guess I'll

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
I can do this I like the

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
fatalities yeah

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
no yeah the fatalities in the video were pretty awesome

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
like throwing one into the incinerator or whatever

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
the furnace because you had the boiler

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
room and the first one that they showed

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
with him pulling him down and the blood coming up

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
that was a nod back to the first movie

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
that was the scene right out of the first movie

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Johnny Depp awesome

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
so yeah Freddy Krueger

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
is going to be the fourth download character

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
it's really one of those things where you look at it and go

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
I don't get it but I kind of do

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
it's not like it's something

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
completely random I guess should be interesting

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
so yeah that will cost you

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
either $4.99 or $400

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Microsoft points unless you're a season pass

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
oooh the daughter

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
of Ra's Al Ghul who is

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
sometimes an anti-heroine

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
and sometimes bad and sometimes

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
good but she is

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
going to be voiced by

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Stana Katic who is in

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Dance Central is getting some new

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
songs. It's actually

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
getting one from Afrika Bambaataa

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
and the Soulsonic Force

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Planet Rock which is one of my favorite

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
songs

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Tayo Cruz, Break Your Heart and Trey Songz

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
featuring

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Fabolous

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
it says Fabolous

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
larger spell but hey

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
I'm excited about the first one

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
and then last

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
but never least Child of Eden

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
gets a PS3 date

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
it will be on September 20th

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
in the US and September 23rd in Europe

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
and the European price

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
is going to be about half as much

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
for the PS3 version so

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
hey

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
that's it

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
awesome

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
alright I guess we should go to the Twitter although

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I forgot to plug that at the top of the show

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
so I don't know if we actually got a lot of tweets tonight

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
but that's okay because we're running along

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
anyway so I guess something's got to give at some point

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
what's going on in the twatter?

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
let's go look at the twatter right now

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
before I get to Twitter though can I say

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
there's another game I've been playing this week that I forgot to mention

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
and I just caught myself looking at it

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
so I have to say

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
on the iPhone there's this game called

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Tiny Tower

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I think a lot of people are playing this

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
but yeah I'm playing

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Tiny Tower and I can't stop playing

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
this game and what it is

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
it's kind of like Sim Tower

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
dumbed down and what's really cute about

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
it is that all your characters are little 8-bit characters

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
you have this tower you can build

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
these different types of levels including

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
apartments that they live in and

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
you can take characters up and down the stairs

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
but what I love about this most is that if you go

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
on the menu there's this thing called BitBook

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
and you can look at what the citizens of

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
your tower are posting on their BitBooks

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
and let's see

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
like for instance I forgot to restock

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
the plant nursery for like a couple hours

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
because I'm doing this show so one of my people

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
wrote on BitBook came to work at the

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
plant nursery but no one is here

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
it's just things like that but one

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
the other day one of them wrote something like

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
we're going to have a party to celebrate

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
so and so moving in silly hats only

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
and that really cracked me up because it was a reference

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
to the cartoon Rejected

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
awesome anyhow yeah that's a free

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
game I've been playing the shit out of that because

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
you know the tower bucks are what cost

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
money but you don't need them to play the game

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
so that whole thing going on

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
alright anyhow

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
back to the Twitter

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
let's see going to the tweets

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
getting into some

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
twats here let's see

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
DJ Rama has tweeted

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
something that's going to come up in a little bit here

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
on the show I think yeah it's coming up a little later

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
so I can't read his tweet but let me go

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
to Spazinator got the ball

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
rolling on getting my PS3 fixed yesterday

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
just waiting on the coffin now

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
non-gaming news as of today

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
gay marriage is now legal in New York State

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
I think that's terrific and

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
I wish our state would catch up

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
I'm like it's not going to send

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
like a gay wave across

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
the nation I'm like

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
gay people are going to be in happy

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
committed stuff whether

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
you choose to acknowledge it legally or not

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
and when you don't acknowledge it legally that's called

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
discrimination I'm like it's as simple as that

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
like what are you going to accomplish

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
banning gay marriage

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
nothing

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
but by doing it you are

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
I could get into that

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
whole rant but it's just like

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
I think D. Snyder said it

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
best in a tweet this week yes I'm referring to

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
D. Snyder from what was

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Twisted Sister he said

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
something like it's 2011

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
if you don't finally support gay marriage then

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
you're the problem

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
anyhow

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
that's how I feel if you don't agree with me deal with it

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
let's see

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I can't remember if this

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
is coming up later or not I think I can

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
talk about this one if I'm

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
repeating a story coming up I apologize

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
S.J. 100 Matt tweeted us with a story about

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Bobby Kotick

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Bobby Kotick opened his mouth again to spew more trash

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
this week now he says DJ Hero was

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
a huge mistake

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
this is in an interview

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
with Forbes magazine

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Bobby Kotick says DJ Hero was a

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
passion project

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
we should have said well how many people

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
really want to unleash their inner DJ

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
and then out of the people who do want to unleash

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
their inner DJ how many want to do it in the

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
context of a game where you earn points

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
versus just taking a DJ deck

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
or tools on their Mac and actually being

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
a DJ and it turns out it's a very

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
small market

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
and Bobby Kotick said that seeing DJ Hero

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
fail despite critical claim in the marketing

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
plan that pushed it down their throats was

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
one of the hardest failures for him

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
so there you go

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
and he also talks about Guitar Hero

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
and so on

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
quote it was very clear people didn't want more 80's heavy

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
metal music but what they wanted was

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
very difficult for us to get from the music companies

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
the number one thing

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
that our audiences wanted in Guitar Hero was

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Led Zeppelin but we couldn't get Led Zeppelin

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
to consent to give us the rights

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
interesting so kind of blaming

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
the failure of Guitar Hero on the music

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
industry and maybe there's only

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
so many songs that people want to play

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
especially when you look at Rock Band

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
shit Rock Band has almost everything now

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
seems like

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
and I'm always wanting more

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
so

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
moving on to

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
other tweets

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Zether77 tweets us saying

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
according to a YouTube video

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Oppa Oppa is a hidden character in Planet Harriers

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
yes

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
but Oppa Oppa also makes appearances in levels

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
ahh I see

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
and somebody else I'm guessing is on his

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
friends list what is this

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
KeegeeKG responded to him

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
and said I've been wanting that for years

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
like since GameCube came out

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
so you're not alone in your Planet Harrier love

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Planet Harriers is like

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
it did look pretty awesome

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
it did look pretty awesome from the video you showed me

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
I kind of wish I'd played that I had no idea that

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
it was at Great America I just somehow

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
overlooked that anyhow

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Tiger Claw says this is a couple tweets one of them

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
is about Majora's Mask that's right

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
on the 3DS why not because

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
you know we had Zelda Ocarina of Time

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
on the 3DS why not

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Majora's Mask

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
well in an interview with Nintendo

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Power

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
E.G. Onoma who is

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
one of the folks behind Zelda

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
he says that

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
it's a possibility

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
and according to him in the interview here

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
quote it wouldn't be an utter

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
impossibility to see a remake

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
so

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
I guess they're saying that if fans demanded

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
it they would make it

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
oh so that you'll do

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
but oh the people wanting you to port

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
a simple game that's already been localized

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
nah you'll take a shit on them

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
yep

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
although I don't know I still think

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Loki there's going to be a press conference

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
where it says the fans demanded it

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
of course they're going to and they're

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
going to come out looking like the heroes

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
look at those abs dude

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
oh on poison

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
look last tweet here

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
from Tiger Claw about Wesley

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Snipes he has made a video game

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
from prison absolutely

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
right this is Julius

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Styles the International it's a video

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
game that Wesley Snipes not to be

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
confused with Julius Styles that's right

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Wesley Snipes by the way most famous for his

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
role in Tu Wong Fu thanks for everything

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Julie Newmar

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
he was

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
he's developing the game in

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
prison and he's developed

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
he's teaming up with developer Lapland

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
so he's been I guess writing down his ideas

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
while he's in prison and it's a game that

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
combines action movie characters

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
like the type of character he played in

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Blade and so forth into one

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I guess character in a video game

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
I

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
guess the game is only coming out on

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
iPad and iPhone because

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
those are probably the easiest platforms to publish on

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
and we like criminals

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
there you go Julius Styles if you want to support

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Wesley Snipes and help fund his legal fund

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
you can check out this game

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
that's it

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
for the Twitter tonight at Twitter.com

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
slash OLR hey we're just

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
about to tonight's list list I'm so

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
excited we haven't done one of these in forever and I thought

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
it's high time we do another game but first

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
another bout of news for you

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
ah yes

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
you know it's like

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
every other week we have a lawsuit against Zynga

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
or you know

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
even one week we had Zynga suing

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
someone else but no this week it's

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
actually a lawsuit against Zynga over Farmville

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
of course the source code

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
apparently a

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
California based web developer named

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
social apps

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
they decided to

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
sue Zynga because of alleged

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
copyright infringement in violation

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
of trade secrets breach of written

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
contract breach of implied in fact

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
contract and breach of

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
confidence

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
their argument is that they entered into

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
agreement with Zynga whereas in Zynga

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
would receive access to their source

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
code for social apps

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
for the social apps

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Facebook game my farm in exchange

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
for some form of compensation

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
according to the suit

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Zynga was given the code at which point they

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
fled into the night never to be heard

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
from again social apps

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
claims that my farm's source code

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
provided the foundation for

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Farmville as well as its many

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
derivatives and they're seeking

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
permanent injunction damages

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
attorneys fees as well as

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
any of Zynga's

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
profits or gains which can be

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
attributed to Farmville

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
so at least we have a legal

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
story tonight that's not some patent

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
or something like that I mean this claim does

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
sound kind of interesting where

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
you know you had the game my farm

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
and they get it so they had my

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
farm they gave the source code to Zynga

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
and then Zynga

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
would get would give them money

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
that they never got is that what's that

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
essentially this is about um am I hearing

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
this right I guess but I

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
don't know why if you would let someone

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
look at your source code and expect them

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
not to steal it you know what I mean

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
I mean it's or use it in some

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
way I guess exactly why

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
would you want to do that what would be the point

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
well maybe Zynga had the idea on

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
how to get it out there I mean Zynga before they

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
put out Farmville weren't they already huge for

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Mafia Wars I don't know

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
don't care so I could see

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
where maybe you're gonna take somebody else's game

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
and make it better and market it a little

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
better and then make tons of money

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
off of it but yeah you would owe them a piece of the

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
profits but of course we're only hearing one side

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
of this have we had an official response from Zynga yet

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
I guess not huh

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
nope all right

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
of course

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
again Zynga is one of those companies where it's like

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
it's really hard to root for them

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
haha

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
anyhow

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
xbox.com

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
we heard about this happening

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
before that games would soon

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
be a part of xbox.com

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
but now I guess with

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
games for windows you know now combining with

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
xbox.com there are four

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
free trial games that you can play

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
on the xbox 360 homepage

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
you can play them right in your browser

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
and you don't have to install them to your computer or anything

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
now the games that you can play

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
plants vs zombies

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
bejeweled 3, zuma's revenge

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
and text twist 2 which are all

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
pretty much popcap games or there's

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
stuff that sound right off of uh

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
um what is

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
it the uh zone

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
msn zone has been around forever and it had

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
all those games too and it's kinda weird that

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
microsoft hasn't brought that into the fold if they haven't already

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
does that still exist

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
I remember I had an account there like

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
forever ago

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
yeah zone msn.com still exists

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
I'm really surprised this isn't in the fold too

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I mean these are like as casual as they get

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
games though

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
this is where you can play such winners as

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
bubbles you play them in your sleep

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
that's casual and patchworks

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
and fishdom

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
spooky splash

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
but you can also play

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
bejeweled 3 on there so it's

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
pretty interesting I don't know

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
but yeah there you go uh those games are now

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
playable free on xbox.com

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
maybe a sign of things to come

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I don't know I bet people would be a lot more interested

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
if you could earn achievements in those games

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
and I'm totally serious when I say that by the way

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
totally serious

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
alright one more story till we get to list list tonight

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Dark Sakura

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
well how about

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
something that

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
I had to make sure that it wasn't a joke when I

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
first saw it

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
the com is announcing street fighter vs hello kitty

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
I'm not joking

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
wait what?

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
fall 2012 street fighter and hello kitty

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
will have a single game together

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
so I could like play as bats maru

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
and like kick ihonda's ass

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
I guess but they

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
put up a picture of

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
kitty dressed up as chun li

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
it was like just a flash

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
on the screen

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
and uh

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
there's nothing else you know really

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
about it but the quote says

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
that this is from Joshua Izzo

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
who's the director of licensing with capcom

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
capcom has long admired Sanrio

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
and their ability to create memorable

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
and cherished lifestyle brands so it is

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
a distinct pleasure to partner with them for this

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
new crossover line of merchandise

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
so it looks like it's just merchandise really

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
yeah it's just like handbags

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
and wallets could you imagine them doing

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
pocket fighter with Sanrio characters

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
that would be weird

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
that would be kind of weird but funny

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
that's kind of cute

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
I don't know like there's a part of me

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
like when I first heard this story I was like

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
no way are they making a game and then I heard it was

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
the merchandising and I'm like that is really

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
weird and I see the picture of hello kitty as chun

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
li and I'm like what in the actual

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
fuck is this and why do I still

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
really want it? I want a bats maru

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
done up as gulkey

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
I think bats maru would probably get the ryu

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
treatment I think that's what I'm gonna see

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
no dear daniel would you think? I think

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
we'll see

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
but I love this chun li kitty it's so adorable

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
I want that

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
alright

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
anyhow let's get to listless

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
I'm so excited we haven't done a

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
game here on OLR in a long time so let's

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
let's do listless

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
tonight we are going to create the

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
definitive list on a particular

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
topic in gaming and

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
here's the way that listless works we're gonna all

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
go around in studio and I'm gonna bring on

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
a guest on the phone here in a moment and we're

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
each gonna bring up our list of three

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
possible choices to put on

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
the list but then the difficult part we all

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
go around and eliminate one from

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
the list that will leave us with a list of eight

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
possible answers for the

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
topic and then you guys

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
in the chat room will get to vote on your number

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
one and number two picks so our

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
list combined with your votes create the

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
definitive list

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
for this topic and there's no argue this is a highly

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
scientific process there's no arguing

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
this is what the fans want

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
alright so I bet you all are

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
dying to know tonight's topic

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
well earlier tonight we talked about

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Freddy Krueger being in Mortal Kombat

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
so now it's pretty clear that Mortal Kombat

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
is clearly adding whatever character

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
they want doesn't even have to be

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
in the Mortal Kombat mythos

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
so what character should

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
be next

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
that's right Mortal Kombat

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
is adding characters so what character

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
should be next let me bring on

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
a fourth panelist tonight

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
now I have to admit I was trying to get

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Extifer tonight because

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
it would have been fun and I know he plays the Mortal Kombat

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
series but unfortunately he

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
had to bow out so he's

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
not going to be able to be on the show tonight he was getting

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
his asshole bleached

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
exactly exactly

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
right so he couldn't join us

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
but I got a substitute that

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
tends to substitute for Extifer over

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
on Horde House as well when needed so

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
here

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:10.000
here we go I'm going to give him a call right now

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
one ringy dingy

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
hopefully it rings I don't know

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
here we go hello hello

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
hey slices pop hey what's up

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
hey not much welcome to Orange Laundry

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
or welcome back rather

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
and thanks for thinking how since I've moved

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
up in here with you I'm sort of on the show

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
less than when I was when I lived in the bay

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
I know it's kind of but here you are you're back again

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
tonight you're welcome to come over whenever you want

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
filling in for Extifer sort of

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
that's who I was trying to get for this segment tonight

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
but just like on Horde House you are saving the day

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
so I appreciate it

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
now usually we have guests

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
we usually have guests on here to plug

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
websites or

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
their own podcast

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
is there anything you want to plug tonight?

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
I was

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
also the guest commentator

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
on the most recent episode of

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Horde House for WoW discussion if anyone cares

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
about that but otherwise not really

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
no I hate WoW and I hate Horde House it's a bad

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
show

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
you should probably stop producing it

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
because you're one of the co-hosts

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
alright let's get

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
to tonight's list

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
alright so you've already been briefed on the

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
topic at hand so everybody here in studio

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
should have their and on the phone should have their

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
top three answers now that Mortal Combat

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
is clearly adding whatever character they

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
want what character should be next

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
now we're also relying on those of you

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
in chat to give your answers

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
because if one of us has an item

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
to get duplicated on the list or something

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
where we don't want to say the same thing twice

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
we often turn to chat to help us

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
out so chat.orangelandradio.com

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
if you want to give your opinions

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
so let's start forming the list and we'll

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
let ladies go first

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
so DarkSakura what is your number three

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
answer? What character should be in

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Mortal Combat next?

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Ash from

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Evil Dead

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Ash from Evil Dead?

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Could you imagine how awesome that would be?

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Weren't there always rumors

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
of like an Ash versus Freddy versus

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Jason movie? There was

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
yeah and he actually did a comic

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
of Army

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
of Darkness versus Marvel Zombies

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
and he was in it. Interesting

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
yeah so

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
not out of the entire realm of possibility

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
of Ash being in a fight again. And you know Bruce

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Campbell likes money. Yeah of course

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
alright I'll go next

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
I'm going to say my number three answer is

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Barney the purple dinosaur

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
this is my number three answer

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
because who doesn't want to

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
perform a fatality on Barney?

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
I love you

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
you love me

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
let's go and beat up Barney

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
with a baseball bat

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
we'll knock him to the floor

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
no more purple dinosaur

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
there you go I'll never sing again on this program

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
ladies and gentlemen

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Barney the purple dinosaur

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
is he even on TV anymore?

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
I think so

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
alright

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
are you a big fan of Barney Slice of Pop?

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
I have two half

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
brothers that are significantly younger than me

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
and they were toddlers during the

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
early and mid 90s which was when

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Barney the dinosaur ruled the fucking world

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
so yeah my

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
16 year old ass had to sit at home

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
and watch those VHS tapes 20

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
30 times in a day. So how do you feel

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
how do you feel about Barney Immortal Combat?

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
There's some trauma there. I think I

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
could get out my

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
PTSD my post-traumatic

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
stress disorder by killing him

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
in Mortal Combat from my teenage

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
years I would be a fan of that

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
alright awesome

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Loki we'll go to you next. What's your number 3 answer?

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
My number 3 answer

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Colonel Sanders

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Why the man from KFC?

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
It would be hilarious. It reminds me of

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Project Aco

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
It's the Colonel

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
I love it

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Alright

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Slice of Pop, your number 3 answer

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
This might be a little bit

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
obscure but for those who remember

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
the Spawn comic

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Spawn from the 90s, Angela

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Angela from Spawn

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Oh

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
She's got the

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
TNA and she's got the brutality

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
so I think she'd be a great fit

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Slice of Pop taking it serious

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
I like this. Angela from the Spawn comics

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
a very serious answer that I'm sure will not

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
survive the elimination round but we'll see what happens

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I'm just kidding. Tell us a little more about

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Angela for those that aren't familiar with the comics

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
and I didn't see that movie either

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Uh

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Spawn was a demon from hell

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
after this alien sort of

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
usurped Lucifer from hell

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
and he was kind of, so Spawn was a demon

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Angela was this badass angel

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
from heaven except she would

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
fucking kill you. She was you know brutal

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
it wasn't a very feathers

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
and wings and pretty choir

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
angels with halos. She was

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
she was really a

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
force to be reckoned with so I

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
definitely think she could kick some ass in Mortal Combat

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Alright, excellent. Alright, let's see if

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
it survives. We've got more to

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
go though. Those are the number 3 answers

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Ash from Evil Dead, Barney the Purple

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Dinosaur, Colonel Sanders and Angela from the

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Spawn comics. Let's go to the number 2s

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Dark Soccer, your number 2 answer

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Um, Pyramid Head

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Pyramid Head

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
from Silent Hill. Need I ask

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
why? No you don't need to

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
I could

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
ask but then I might end up dead right?

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
He's badass

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
and that's actually a serious suggestion. Alright

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
that's a good answer. Pyramid

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Head is on the list there. I saw that in chat

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
and actually when I saw it go by in chat

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Zethur in chat suggested when I saw that I was like

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
oh I'm taking that one if one of mine gets stolen

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
but since now

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
it's already on the list I'll use my original number

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
2 answer which I'm sorry this

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
would be badass and this should absolutely

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
be in Mortal Kombat and

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
who is a

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
character? I'm going to ask this question

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Who is a character more scary

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
than Freddy Krueger and Jason

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
combined? Who is the scariest

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
fucking character ever in the history of ever?

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
My mother pissed off? No

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Pennywise the Clown

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Oh my god

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
And that's my number 2 answer. Pennywise

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
the Clown. I am afraid of clowns

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
and I really hate that clown

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
So don't you want to kill one?

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Well Shang Tsung turned into

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Well you know Shang Tsung's clown fatality

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
was supposed to be Joker's fatality

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Oh wow

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
In the DC vs. Mortal Kombat

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
It was the fatality

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
But

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
No it was supposed to be they changed it

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
No it's exactly the same as the fatality

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
that Joker used in

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Because he wasn't supposed to actually shoot him

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Yeah well it goes off camera

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Yeah it goes off camera but

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
but you see the whole thing in

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Mortal Kombat Alright

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
So there you go. Pennywise the Clown from IT

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Alright

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Loki what's your number 2 answer?

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
My number 2 answer is the most

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
frightening thing beyond Pennywise

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
the Clown

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
that is just hit media

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
all together and that would be Lady Gaga

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
If anyone deserves to be torn apart

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
as strange as fucking hell is Lady Gaga

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Hey! Hey!

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
You could do some Ermac and some Noob Saibot

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
fucking crazy morphing shit with those costumes

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
of hers You could it would be costume

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
morphing and like her costumes would be like

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
those bubble dresses would be filled

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
with acid and shit like I would play as

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Lady Gaga and I would beat your ass

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
I would shove a 9 inch

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
stiletto in your characters eye

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
For the record Becky said she jumped when you said Pennywise

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
I'm telling you Pennywise is a scary

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
mother fucker Alright there you go

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Lady Gaga. Oh I love this

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
DDR dollar villain chat suggests Pennywise

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
turns into a giant spider for a fatality

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
That's good

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Alright

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Uh, Salacious Pop it's over to you

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
What's your number 2 answer?

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
So the key question to this list list

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
is characters

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
and not people so

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
I'm saying Rose mother fucking Nylund

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
from the Golden Girls

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Betty White

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Rose Nylund

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Rose Nylund

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
She'll kill you

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
And

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
what would Rose Nylund's fatality be

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
would it be a story from St. Olaf

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Yes she'd tell us St. Olaf story

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
and you would take a shotgun and you would kill yourself

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Alright

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
I always

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Hey I always wanted my

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Golden Girls game that was Grandma Got Guns

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
and it was about the Golden Girls just going on

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
a rampage to save their retirement

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
home or whatever. Alright so Rose Nylund

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
is uh

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Salacious Pop's number 2 answer. Alright here it is

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
time for the number 1 answers

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
and we're gonna go around and get them

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Let me read the list so far

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Ash from Evil Dead, Barney the Purple Dinosaur

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Colonel Sanders, Angela from Spawn, Pyramid Head

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Lady Gaga and Rose Nylund

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
who is of course Betty White from the Golden Girls

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Alright so now it's time to get the number 1

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
answers. Dark Sakura

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
I went serious with all my answers you know

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
I picked Sera Pizzini

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Witchblade

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
You gotta spell that last name for me

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
I was thinking of her

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
when Rob told me what Luke was

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
ZZINI

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Okay P-I-Z-Z-I-N-I I don't know this character

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
either you gotta explain this to me a little bit

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
The Witchblade basically is like this

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
gauntlet that's stuck on one hand but it

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
will turn into any weapons and the armor

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
so she's like wearing like this big metal ball

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
but she's all coated in the weapon

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Alright

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
I think the Elts got like half of it and now there's

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
a new Witchblade and I kind of got

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
out of it around then but there was also

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
a cool

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Battle of the Planets crossover where

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
and keep in mind

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I know all the Gachamon names so I think in

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Battle of the Planet it's just called Princess

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Whoever Jun the Swan was in Gachamon

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
She got the Witchblade so it was a

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
neat kind of crossover but other than that

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
you know I think that

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
I just always liked the character so

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
she'd be badass

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
I'm gonna get to my number one answer

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
My number one answer is also a very serious answer

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
like I really think and Salacious Pop might be mad

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
at me because I have a feeling this could be who he's thinking

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
too so I apologize in advance

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
if this is your answer Salacious Pop but I have to say

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
a character I would honestly love to see

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
in Mortal Kombat that would kick a lot of ass

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
would be Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Hell yeah!

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
That was of course

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Uma Thermos character in Kill Bill

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Was that your answer Salacious Pop?

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Well um I was gonna

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
say uh

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
she's the best character

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
in the whole thing and I can't

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Daryl Hannah who did she play?

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Oh um

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Black Mamba

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
No Black Mamba was Beatrix

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
She was California

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
King Snake but the character was

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
L Driver

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Was that your number one really?

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
No no I was going to but I'm gonna switch something else now

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
because Beatrix is better

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Alright so there it is Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
How could I not? I'm just like

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
my god she kicks so much ass

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
I would hate to see her die but at the same time

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
she's gonna just chop bitches arms off and so forth

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
so there you go Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
is my number one answer

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Loki your number one answer

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
My number one answer

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
unfortunately he is

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
he has passed but uh

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Billy Mays

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Billy Mays hi guys

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Billy Mays here

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Would he actually show off something

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
in his infomercial before killing you with it?

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
He would throw OxiClean on you

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
He would die

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
He would spray you with OxiClean and then start

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
scrubbing away until your face came off

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
There you go there you go

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Alright Billy Mays

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
I could use the Kaboom or whatever

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Alright so SlaciousPop it's down to you

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Eleven on the list so far

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
One spot left

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
SlaciousPop what is your number one answer?

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Mr. Rogers

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Mr. Rogers

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Mr. Rogers

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Are you inspired by the ultimate battle of ultimate destiny?

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
From Mr. Rogers neighborhood

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Was that a yes?

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Yeah

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
I knew it

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
So why Mr. Rogers?

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
No one is that nice

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
You gotta have a dark vibe

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
He actually was really that nice in person

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Yeah

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Like seriously

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
You know those

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
A-holes at that particular church in

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Kansas I don't want to name them on the show but we

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
the funerals and all that stuff right

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
And you know actually a lot of that

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
stuff it pissed me off but I didn't get

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
really pissed off until they were gonna protest

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Mr. Rogers funeral and I was like

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
You don't fucking like Mr. Rogers

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000

Oh nice nice

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
I almost thought about Voldemort but

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
I'm surprised no one said Amy Winehouse I mean that would be

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Actually I changed Amy Winehouse to Michael Jackson

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Oh there you go

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
uh Tigerclaw said how about Justin Bieber

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
there you go

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Wyland says Sam from Trick or Treat

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
uh act deft says how about Bobby Kotek

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
that will show us Tigerclaw says Snake Pliskin

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Giant Enemy Crab

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
uh J100 Matt says

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
America McGee's Alice I don't know if he was responding

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
to another question Zither said Panty and Stalking

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
um

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
let's see

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
trying to look quickly through

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Elmer Fudd

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
seriously says Legend of Zaku

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Tigerclaw says how about the Queen

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Alien from Aliens

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
uh there's a few people saying Pikachu

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Laha says Pikachu

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Pikachu

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
so they go oh and uh Jovidea says Ronald McDonald

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
there you go alright

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
so

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
now is the time where we eliminate things from

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
the list I know this is going to be very difficult but unfortunately

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
some items are going to have to come

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
off the list so here we go

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
insulation pop I posted it to you in a

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
private message so you can follow along here

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
um Dark Sakura

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
this is hard these are all good answers tonight

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
we don't often have this in list list

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
usually like there's a couple shitty ones on there but these are

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
all good but unfortunately

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
this is a scientific process and for the scientific

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
process to continue something

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
must come off the list Dark Sakura which of these

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
is not worthy of the list I would have to say

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Barney because I find him even more

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
traumatic than anything else in the

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
universe and just I wouldn't

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
be able to fight him because I would have to pause

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
the game and go throw up alright Barney

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
the purple dinosaur has been stricken from the list

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
uh I am going to remove

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
I'm sorry I do think this is a great idea

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
but it's just a little too crazy

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
I'm taking Billy Mays off the list

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Billy Mays is not worthy of the list so it has been stricken

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
from the list Loki which of these is not

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
worthy of the list?

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
unfortunately it's not the

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
golden girl I would have picked so

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Rose Nylund has to be removed off the list

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Bea Arthur was a close second

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Bea Arthur is a bad ass bitch

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
you should have just went with Maude

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
and then there's Maude

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
I have to

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
share this with you do you ever watch the

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Deadpool PSAs? No

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Deadpool had a minor obsession

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
with Bea Arthur, ok a major obsession with Bea Arthur

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
and it had a poster in the

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
the thing that said don't you wish your girlfriend was

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
hot like Bea

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
yes alright

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
so Rose Nylund has been stricken from the list

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
so nine items

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
remain Salacious Pop it comes down to you

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
one of these must come off the list for us to proceed

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
which of these is not worthy of the list Salacious Pop?

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Pennywise the

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
clown

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
why that was the best answer on there

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
and I'm saying that because I'm totally biased

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
why are you getting rid of Pennywise?

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Warner Brothers ain't trying to bring class action

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
lawsuits at people just you know

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
being terrified at this game

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
cause that's some traumatic shit

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
however wouldn't it have been cool to actually get Tim Curry to voice him

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
I know right

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
or just have Tim Curry

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I'm so angry

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Frank should be in it

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Frank and Porter should be in it instead

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
I'm so angry

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000

Tigerclaw says

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000

Mortal Kombat his little intro animation

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000

don't kick him from chat

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
and the other one is two so there it is again

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000

are you regretting your decision

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
I'm being egged on

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
to retaliate by someone and I won't say who

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
and I will

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
respect the fact that I have ops

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
temporarily and I will not do it

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
alright plus you don't want to

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000

and we appreciate you had some great answers tonight

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
despite the elimination

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
controversy quickly anything you

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
want to plug like your Twitter or anything like that

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
I don't know if you do writing online or whatever that you want to plug

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
I just want to say that don't

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
worry you'll float we all float down

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
here

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
alright there you go

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
thanks Salacious Pop

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
bye

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
alright

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
while those votes come in let's get back

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
into some other gaming news and we're going to

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
go over to Loki

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
with some news about GameCube games

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
yes apparently Nintendo director of

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
entertainment and trend marketing Amber

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
McCollum

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
was quoted

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
during an interview with

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Nintendo Gal on the subject

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
of GameCube games not being playable on the upcoming

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Wii U

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
McCollum said GameCube disc

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
will not be compatible with the Wii U

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
but a number of games that were

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
playable on the GameCube can be downloaded

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
from WiiWare

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
and people were like really

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
is that going to be possible

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
are you going to be able to download games

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
via some sort of storage device

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
or something like that

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
of course when asked to clarify

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
that statement

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
they went and said to clarify the

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
capabilities of the Wii U system

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
as correctly stated the Wii U will not be able to

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
play Nintendo GameCube disc

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
however Nintendo has not made any announcement

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
regarding download content so they kind of

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
back stepped a little bit but it sounds

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
like that maybe that's something

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
that they're going to be working towards

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
is having GameCube games downloadable

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
do you think that will really happen

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
because it would seem to be like the

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
GameCube games are kind of large but then again

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
we have Xbox 360 games and so forth

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
I'm not sure if they would do that

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
I think if anything they would just re-release

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
GameCube games or touch

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
them up somewhat and

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
re-release them on like they were doing

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
the new play control stuff where it was on a Wii disc

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
but it was a GameCube game I could see more

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
of that happening right

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
because it gives them an excuse to charge more money

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
and I would gladly pay for

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
F-Zero GX all over again though to be honest

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
I'm not even going to lie like take my money

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
I would gladly pay you tomorrow for a hamburger

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
today you be quiet

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
alright moving on

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
to a story about iRAM

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
do you know the company iRAM have you ever heard of iRAM?

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Breaking R-Type! Hello! That's right they made R-Type

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
they made a lot of other interesting games too

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
but here's the deal

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
R-Type there's a few of these games on the PSP

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
like there's R-Type Tactics on the PSP

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
R-Type Tactics 2

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
there's also the game Archives have

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
R-Types and R-Types Delta these are all over the

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Playstation Network and Playstation Go

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
well guess what? Come August 11

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
these games are going away

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
iRAM is taking their catalog off of the

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Playstation Network and

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
the same thing goes for their specific Playstation

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
home lounges

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
they had some like I guess 9 lounges

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
that were about these games

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
they are all going away

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
I guess the Doki Doki Suikoden

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
lounge is the only one that's staying

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
I don't know

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
so yeah iRAM has not said why

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
they're going away but these games

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
on PSP are no longer going to be available

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
now a lot of these I've never heard of

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
there's games like these are all very

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Japanese titles

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
2 based on cartoon cone

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
bumpy trot beagle battle tournament

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
these are all games that are downloadable right now

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
on Playstation Network they are going to be going away

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
on August 11th I wonder if this is

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
some type of retaliation

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
so to speak for the PSN being down

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
for so long

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
I don't know nah it's probably just licensing

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
coming up and they decided not to renew it

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
or something gotcha

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
alright well there you go

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
they are coming off of Playstation Network

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
so enjoy them while you can not like I can't bust

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
out you know the master system

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
games quite interesting a long time gamer like

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
yourselves I actually

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
I am actually quite indifferent about

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
this tactic I do buy most of my games

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
new like Rob though I do dabble

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
in the occasional used title here and there as well

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
while I am not foolish enough to believe that

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
every used game equals a lost new game

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
sale it would be equally foolish to

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
assume that new game sales aren't somewhat

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
hurt by the used game market

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
frankly I don't buy the whole spin about

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
online passes being for servers or what not

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
it's simply a way to be able to

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
get a piece of the used game market for publishers

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
that being said I have no problem

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
with that being a pitfall of buying a

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
used game everything is included

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
with a new purchase so I will

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
always have and

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
more often than not choose that

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
option the harsh reality is

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
that game makers and publishers

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
owe nothing to used game purchasers because it

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
doesn't make them any money directly

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
I know that this

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
slippery slope argument exists

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
at the same time I give consumers more credit

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
than Loki may that they can look at each

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
issue on a case by case basis and reject

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
ideas that they feel cross the line

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
I have often wondered if there could be

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
a moratorium on used game sales

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
placed for maybe 3 or 6 months

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
so that new games aren't hindered by used

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
game sales at the end of the day

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
both used games and new games have their place

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
for now and I can't begrudge anyone

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
for choosing what solution works for them

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
thanks to all of you darkcharger

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
PS if the show is interested in

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
a new copy of Adobe Lightroom 3

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
yes

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Jamie is

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
yes email

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
me and I will send it to you as a gift

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
thanks again for the podcast I wish that

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
I could listen live more often

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
yes

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
saved

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
I think

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
the idea is interesting about the whole moratorium

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
but I just don't think it's possible

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
because you'd be telling people they can't

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
sell their own new product

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
like what's to stop me from

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
going to my neighbor saying oh yeah you want this game

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
I don't really play it here give me 40 bucks

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
it would never happen because you're basically telling people

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
that when they're done with their game that they can't trade it

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
back into I mean okay let's say that they're able

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
to sell it back to GameStop but GameStop's not gonna sell

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
they're not gonna sit on a bunch of

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
product that's gonna be devaluing

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
you know over time especially when they're

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
taking trades in on games you know to

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
see that's the thing

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
is they use game sales

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
it gets people to trade in their games

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
to like a GameStop or something like that so they

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
buy those new games that you

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
want them to buy

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
but now if you take that money source

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
away I guess of them

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
if you basically ban used game

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
sales or make it not very

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
pretty to the fact that

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
it devalues the used game

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
then they're not gonna have money to

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
buy that new game that you want

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
to buy so you see you're in turn

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
hurting yourself

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
but they won't figure that out until

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
everyone jumps on board with this type of

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
you know scheme

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
and then it affects them down

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
the line and they're like ah crap

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
why did we do that?

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
You know and I'm kind of

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
in the boat as this guy I mean he already said he's

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
kind of like me where you either buy it new or you don't buy it

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
and especially considering what I talked about at the

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
top of the show as in one particular store I will

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
not be shopping at anymore for new or used games

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
I mean there's your biggest used market right

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
there but not

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
to say I would never buy a game used I mean there's

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
obviously other people trying to get in that market as well

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
but honestly I find now

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
by the time I want to go back

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
and get an old game and

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
I'd be actually looking for it used cause you usually can't

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
find the new game used it's so hard

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
to get it like I think the last

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
new game that I bought used was the Tron

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
game and I

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
the minute I played it I could see why somebody sold it

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
back right away so usually

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
you know if a game's really that good you can't

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
find it used right away

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
we go buy used games though fairly

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
regularly but that's just

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
because we might want to finish a collection

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
but I think at this point if I did want to

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
go get a used game I would just check the price on

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Amazon or you know other competing

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
internet websites like Best Buy or whatever

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
and see what the price is and if it's

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
good enough I'll just buy it online

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
so

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
until one of those stores pisses me off

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
then I'll stop shopping there too

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
alright next email

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
hello olr

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
here's an orange lounge foodie-o question

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
but it does relate to a video game do you think

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
dominos will ever bring back the noid

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
we need a new yo noid

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
game dammit

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
brought to you by sizzler

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
home of the 3 day old salad bar that tastes like shit

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
and gives you the shit the squits

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
that's from chiggers

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
who by the way did get his name from where you thought

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
ewww

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
he said he had it as a kid or something like that

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
and that's where he got his name

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
I either

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
he emailed horde house about that or I ran into him

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
on wow and we brought that up

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
let's see

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
do I think dominos would ever bring back the noid

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
no dominos did this really interesting

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
thing where they kind of came out and admitted that their pizza

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
tastes like shit and that they're going to totally

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
redo it like it was this very interesting

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
campaign that they did and it worked

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
like dominos sales have been up quite a bit

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
in the past year or so people like that

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
self deprecating sense of humor and I think

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
because of that because dominos is trying to distance

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
themselves from the past you're not going to see the

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
noid ever come back I think the noid is something that's very

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
80's well never

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
say never but you're not going to see it in the next

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
5 years no so

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
sadly that would mean the same for the yo noid

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
game here's a question for you guys though

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
do you think we'll see any other like

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
commercial product video games

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
again because we used to get these all the time

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
back in the day like there was the mick kids game

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
the california raisins game

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
where the hell is my damn

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
burger king connect games were the most

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
recent ones they're supposed to have the burger king connect

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
game and they never fucking put it out

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
I don't know so we'll see

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
and now

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
burger king's all over transformers but no games

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
about chiggers

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
transformers all hasbro

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
the end no I'm kidding how about

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
another email yes another email

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
yes okay

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
I'm a few shows behind in my listening but

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
I just want to respond to Rob with his

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
opinion that college is a waste of money and you

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
learn better by doing I 100%

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
agree I spent 5 years in

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
college earned 2 bachelors degree television

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
production and asian studies graduated

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
summa cum laude in the top 10%

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
of my class I can be quoted

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
as saying frequently that the only good thing that

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
I got back from college was a husband

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
aside from being an abstract requirement

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
BK have

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
a BA when we don't care which one

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
nobody cares about all the painstaking

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
work I did in college I haven't touched editing software

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
since I left I haven't spoken Japanese Chinese

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
or Spanish since I left

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
all of the hard earned knowledge has faded away

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
and the reality is set in unless you're going to be

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
a doctor lawyer or something that requires daily

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
use of the knowledge you got in college it's

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
ultimately a costly waste of time

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
the job I have now has

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
diddly to do with my fancy degrees and I'm still

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
paying on the $2,000 I have

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
left in college bills when I have kids

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
they're going to trade school and learn to be plumbers

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
or HVAC technicians or car mechanics

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
and at

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
least then I will be secure in the knowledge that

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
what they've learned is useful and the

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
very least will save them money because they can fix

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
their own stuff Holly V

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
now I do have to say though

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
in the design field like

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
what I'm in college

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
college ends up being useful

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
because the classes that I take have

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
practical application for what

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
I'm doing I've built my

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
portfolio I've marketed myself

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
I'm already getting work and I

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
haven't finished college so I'm just

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
saying well and I want to be careful too I don't want to become

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
like this anti-college spokesperson because I wasn't

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
quite the point of my rant but I think what

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
I was meaning to get at is that it's not for everyone

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
and I think some people kind of

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
feel like there's this necessity like

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
I have to go I have to go and you

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
maybe you don't you know that's all

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
I'm kind of saying and you know will I ever go

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
back someday and finish maybe

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
but right now for the career that I'm doing

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
I would be better off spending my time getting

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
certifications and licenses and

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
things from organizations that support

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
my industry and not really a state school

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
I hate to say it but that's

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
where my

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
enrichment is going to come from now let me put it this way

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
college isn't for everyone but it might be for

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
you and your field and whatever you're doing

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
and here's my honest advice if you are going to go to

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
college here's the mistake not to make

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
make sure you don't do

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
nothing but school

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
okay if you're going to go to college

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
make sure you do some extracurricular activities

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
make sure you do internships

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
oh my god take I mean

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
I know it might sound ludicrous like I gotta do something and don't

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
get paid but the networking and experience

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
you're going to get from that are going to mean so

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
much more than your

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
A's and B's I'm serious

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
also make friends with your teachers

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
who are working in the field

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
yeah you're not in high school anymore it's not

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
cool to hate your teachers well I mean

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
keep in mind now I'm in school to be

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
a graphic designer which was

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
funny because I learned a lot of the programs

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
and stuff on my own but

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
I have picked up so much

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
in design technique and in theory

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
and just in studying

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
you know I

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
the best classes I've taken are my two

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
art history classes and my typography

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
class those have been my favorite so far

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
that and my portfolio class

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
which you've seen my portfolio

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
it came out fully

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
interview ready

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
I've got my portfolio online if anyone wants to see my

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
stuff just let me know and I will show you

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
and then hire me please

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
I will say this too you might be surprised

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
to hear me say this but I actually think it also

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
would be a good use of your time if this is

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
a scene you are into and if this is something you are

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
into join a fraternity or a sorority

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
that definitely was not the

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
scene for me but you know what

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
for some people I know that have been in that scene it has

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
been an

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
immensely helpful networking tool

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
like immensely helpful

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
networking tool you would be like those are connections

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
you're going to have for life so it's

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
been very rewarding for some people I know so

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
you know but it's not

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
for everyone either and it's really

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
about finding the right one for

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
you is a huge challenge

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
well and also find

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
different clubs or online

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
groups that people

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
in your field are going to like

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
you know if you're in engineering look for stuff

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
through the department of engineers you know that type

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
of stuff and if you're going to go to college

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
just to drink do yourself and do

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
the college a favor and don't go to college

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
or at least get a liberal arts degree

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
no not even that I'm just going to say

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
do yourself a favor and don't go to college

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
like you will be wasting money

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
you'll be wasting time

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
one thing about college though that I will say

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
is that

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
it gives you a chance to experiment

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
with new ideas and

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
to pick

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
different things because I've changed my

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
major like nine times before I finally just

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
decided to go with what I loved anyway

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
because I started off

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
as a forensic geology major

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
did you know that? I studied

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
rocks for blood

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
it was boring

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
as fuck

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
and then I changed my major so many times

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
and finally decided to stick with

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
art with something in the art field

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
I hate doing illustration for other people

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
because it's not my drawings anymore

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
but I love doing design for other people

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
and I've developed a passion

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
for it but I wouldn't have known that

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
design was where my heart was

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
until

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
I tried to do illustration and

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
I tried to do all this other stuff and eventually

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
I found the right path

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
by, and I even found out that

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
specifically print is my passion

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
and I would never have known that

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
if I had not taken typography

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
right then and there, if I had not taken the

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
InDesign class, so I'm just saying

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
as an example, school

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
is a good place to experiment

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
without

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
getting a job that you're going to hate

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
you know what I mean? So

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
I'm not going to continue my

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
rant, I said what I said a couple

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
shows ago and I stand by that

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
you know, but yeah

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
it's not for everyone, but it might be for you

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
and that's okay. It's your money

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
spend it how you want to spend it

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Next email

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
Hi OLR crew, this is your

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
friendly neighborhood Mexican act Deft

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
I'm pretty sure you have already talked and discussed

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
about Capcom this week, but I want to vent a little

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
and share my two cents on their most recent happenings

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Well needless to say, as many people

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
have probably said now, I

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
pretty much lost all faith in Capcom

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Was it because of the release of

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3? No

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
I actually think, I actually

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
was pretty excited about

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
especially because of the addition of Phoenix Wright

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
Yeah granted, they're doing an update to a game not even

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
nine months after release of the first edition

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Capcom has always done this kind of stuff

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
with all their fighting series and

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
I've learned to accept it. If you know Capcom

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
then you pretty much expect it to do so

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
which by the way, that actually did remind

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
me of something

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
when they did

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
all the different matching service

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
and different versions of Street Fighter 3 like

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Second Strike and Third Impact

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
That's the same thing

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Anyway, so why have I lost my confidence

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
in Capcom? It's because of all their

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
recent decisions as a company

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
and there's a lot of things that I can name

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
or list here. Unnecessary DRM

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Mercenaries 3DS, Bionic Commando

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Rearm 2, Super Street Fighter

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
4, Arcade Edition

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
The Cancellation of Games, Mega Man

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
Universe, Unnecessary Reboots, Devil May Cry

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
No localizations of games

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
people truly want, No Word on Monster Hunter

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
nor Ace Attorney Investigations 2 being localized

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Little by little, Capcom has

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
done really bad decisions

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
that have really affected the fans

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
A company that was recently known

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
to cater to the fans and still even now

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
they kind of do it, is losing a lot of stuff

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
that have their fans

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
really angry, including me

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
and I think the straw that broke the camel was

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
the cancellation of Mega Man Legends 3

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
People have wanted that game for so long

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
and they just took it from them like

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
if nothing happened. And with this

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
also comes the slow killing

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
of Mega Man. Mega Man X was the most

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
wanted for MVC 3

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
and they didn't mention him being an ultimate

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
All of those things they've done

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
little by little have created a really

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
big ball of shit and they can't hide it now

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
and even if they do, the stink is so big

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
people will be reminded because of it

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
Capcom has created their own demise and unless

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
they do something to fix this problem, or at least

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
they admit they do have a problem

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
I won't be buying any game they release anytime

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
soon. And I mean it, not even

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
the Darkstalkers teaser they showed in their

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
Street Fighter X Tekken panel

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
Oh yeah, that hasn't even come up in the show yet

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
but yeah. A game I have wanted

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
to make, I've wanted them to make

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
for a long time

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
won't blind me of all they have done to lose

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
me as a fan. As Zekeman said in his

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Tumblr and Twitter, Capcom, it's not me, it's you

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
Thanks for reading this

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
and for keep on giving gamers a voice

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Act deft

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
Last email? I'm curious to see

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
how long that holds, and I'm not trying to be like

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
a jerk about it, but you know, usually this

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
internet rage, and then they'll announce something

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
you just have to have

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
But um, you know, obviously Capcom

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
surprisingly went from

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
all the fans love them and have very

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
loyal fans, to literally within the scope

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
of two weeks, have become

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
like, quote, the

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
Japanese Bobby Kotek, you know

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
what I mean? Like, it's just interesting

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
My How the Mighty Have Fallen

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
And uh, yeah, I

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
I just think the way Capcom cancelled it too

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
didn't help. And it's

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
it sucks that they said, hey, let's

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
involve this community, our hardcore fans

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
in a game, and then tell them the game isn't good enough

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
It's essentially what they did, that's

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
that's tough. That's a tough pill to swallow

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
Anyhow

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Um, last email?

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
Yep. Hi, OLR

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
Just wanted to write in after the last few

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
weeks, comments from Capcom's David Reeves

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
I, I was more than

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
a little miffed at what he said

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
This coming from the same guy who used to

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
run Sony of Europe, and said that when

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
the PS3 was launching, that we have

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
built up a certain brand equity

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
over time, since the launch of

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
Playstation in 1995 and PS2 in 2000

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
The first five million are going to buy it

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
whatever it is, even if it doesn't

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
have games. And then he linked

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
to the full article, uh, interview

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
Anyway, I'm not going to rant, so I'll be off

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Catastrophic Moggy

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
I don't like that, Catastrophic Moggy

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
Yeah

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
It's kind of dickly

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
Not, not muggy, but

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
all the stuff

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
Oh, that's not the interview

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
Sorry, I'm reading over your shoulder here

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
Yeah, this is the interview

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
It's a pretty long one, but

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
Like, one of the questions

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
Um, are you confident in your

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
approach and the inevitable buildup to

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
November's launch hype? And he says

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
without being too arrogant, I don't think we

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
worry too much about building up the hype in the

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
first six months, because when the rubber hits

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
the road is going to be when all those hardcore

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
gamers have bought PS3s

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
They have also bought Xbox 360s and they

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
probably bought Nintendo Wii as well

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
So basically, you know

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
There's a lot that haven't, though

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
There's a lot of people that only adopt one of

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
those systems, you know?

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
I don't know

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
That guy says a lot of very interesting things

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
Alright, that's going to do it for email tonight

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
if you want to send us an email for a future week

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
In the meantime, I believe it's time

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
to get the ranting on

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
in a segment we call the FUs of the Week

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
Let's go to the FUs of the Week right now

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Music

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:18.000
An FU to the bee sting I got on my neck

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:22.000
And the stinger didn't break the skin

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
Well, it broke the skin, but not like

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
it didn't get stuck in there

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
But it is enough

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
I'm allergic to bees

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
So it's enough that it's

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
pretty bad

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
I also got another, I got a scrape from the stinger

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
on my leg from a dead bee in the pool

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
And that thankfully didn't swell up

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
But I got another one and I have no idea when I got it

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
It was just

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
I felt it, and that was it

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
Uh, go ahead Logie

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:52.000
Um, FU to uh

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:56.000
I guess I'm not agreeing so far away

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
Alright

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
And my FU goes to um

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
a couple things tonight, FU to Johnny Rockets

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
because I went there to eat the other day and it took like

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
25 minutes to get our food

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
Uh, and it wasn't even busy

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
But, and also FU to them because once the food finally

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
did fucking come, the burgers I had were fucking delicious

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
There were sliders, that's why I said burgers

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
I'm not that fat

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
Those sliders are fucking good

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
Have you had the orange

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
was it the orange dreamsicle shake

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
No, no

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
Like I'm actually trying to lose weight

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
right now, so Johnny

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
I had to cut back on something

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
No, no, you should not cut back on the orange dreamsicle shake

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
That is delicious

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
Oh, I, uh, yeah, so FU

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
Yeah, and FU to the fact that they derailed my diet

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
because that food is so delicious

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
Well, I don't know which Johnny Rockets you went to, but they have one

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
I'll say Arden Fairmaul

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
Well, they have a new one now that's across from the new

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
Palladio theaters

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
Oh, okay

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
Uh, yeah, I bet they didn't take

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Well, see, if it took, like, if the place

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
was packed and busy, then I would understand why it would take so long

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
It was, like, empty, it was weird

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
So, anyway, FU did that

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
And FU did those burgers being delicious and making me want to go through that torture

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
again just to have them and screw up my diet

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
I've lost ten pounds in three months, almost

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
Nine pounds in three months

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Get a bicycle and go riding with me

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
We live too far apart

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
to do that every day, especially this time of year

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
Alright, uh, and then

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
Oh, the other FU, I have one more FU

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
And then FU goes to, um, Salacious Pop

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
Not only for eliminating Pennywise from the list

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
But we went to the casino last night

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
I lost $20

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
This bitch puts, like, $5

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
in the slot machine and on his second pull

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
wins $70

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Did he buy you dinner?

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
No!

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
But he did buy all the stuff at Target earlier that day

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
so I can't complain, I can't complain

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
He bought me a Hummingbird feeder because I wanted one

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
That's awesome

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
I know, I know

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
I know, at the end of the day

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
But I was really mad at the moment

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Not really, though

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
Did you stomp your little foot?

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
I wasn't mad that he won, I was mad that I lost

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
and he won on his second pull

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
You should see how fast I went through $20

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
He was just gone in a snap, and then he's like

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
Oh, I think I'm winning, like, all this money

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
The coin thing keeps going

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
Do I get to keep all this?

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:12.000
Now you see why I don't like to gamble

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
Oh, I still love to gamble

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
I don't even play the lottery

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
I love gambling

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
It's a bad problem I have

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
Anyhow, let's move on to

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
a couple more news stories for you guys

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
and then the Skype line

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
as well as the results of tonight's list list

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
So let's do a couple more stories for you guys

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
Loki

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
You may remember a couple weeks back

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
we talked a little bit about people

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
that had games on

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
the Indie Games Store

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
on the Xbox Marketplace

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:46.000
were complaining that they just weren't getting enough exposure

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:50.000
and that the sales weren't very well

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
even for some of the top games on that service

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
Well, one of those companies

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
Z-Boy Games

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
they, of course, released

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death 7

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:04.000
They now have put their games on Steam

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:08.000
and they're very pleased on how things are going

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
In fact, they're saying that

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
Z-Boy Games

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
has already made more revenue

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
in less than a week on Steam

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
than we have in over a year and a half

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
on Xbox Indie Games

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
That sucks

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
Well, it sucks for the Indie Games

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
but good for them that they're making money

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:30.000
Basically saying that they

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
decided, you know

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
because of this

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
that they're definitely looking at

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
launching more games on to Steam

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:42.000
versus, you know, the Xbox Indie Games service

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
And of course, you may remember

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
they also took donation support

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
That's a pretty big slap in the face

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
to Xbox Live Indie Games

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
and I think a pretty obvious showing

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
of how Steam's doing it right and Xbox

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
isn't doing it right when it comes to the Indie Games

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
but to be fair, there is a little bit of apples and oranges

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
going on here because

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
Steam, that really was

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
their only new release that week

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
whereas with Xbox Live, you still have all the

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
arcade games and all that stuff that they do have to promote

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
But, I'm not going to say I totally disagree

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
I think they should start featuring

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
some Indie Games in the main banner

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
once in a great while, especially these big ones

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
that do very well

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
If they would take the Indie Games

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
and say, have a certain release day

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
for those, and maybe

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
a little bit more quality control with the stuff that's released

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
You know, because I know with

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
WiiWare and stuff, you have blog sites

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
and everything that lists

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
And actually Kotaku's been pretty good about

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000
they don't know

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
I don't know if they do all the Indie Games

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
that are released that week

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
or if it's just the ones that

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
they're playing or the ones

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
that they think are kind of cool

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
They'll do a thread every

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
week or so, pointing those out

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
and how much you can get them for

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
and the links to download them and that kind of stuff

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
I think that they should have something like that

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000
where the Playstation Network comes out and says

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000
Hey, here's what's releasing on our service

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
and not necessarily promoting them

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
but it's at least mentioning them

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
so people are aware of them

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
and granted, there's a lot of crap on there too

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
but

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
it's just, you know, there's something wrong

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
obviously, if they're making

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
more money on Steam

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000
than they are in the Indie Games service

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
in less than a week

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:28.000
I mean, why would you waste your time on Indie Games

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000
if you can just

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
put your game on Steam

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000
and make that money in a week?

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
Yeah, that's kind of scary

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000
but then again, if all

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
I mean, Xbox Live gets a lot

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
of Indie Games and these were obviously

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000
two of the quality ones

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
If everything that went out on Xbox Live

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
went up on Steam, they wouldn't all sell as well

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
That's the difference

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
Well, yes, they wouldn't all sell as well

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
but the ones that people are actually putting effort into

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
and are considered hits on

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000
the Indie Games service

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
aren't making that much money anyways

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
I guess that's true enough

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
Alright, let's go to

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
a story here about Akira Yamaoka

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
working with Suda51

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
He's, what they say, tag teaming

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
with Suda51 on the game development

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
This is during an interview on the

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
8-4 play podcast

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
Yamaoka talked a little more about what his

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
role is, besides just the chief

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000
sound officer

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000
Quote, at Grasshopper I'm creating sound

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000
but not only sound, I'm the leader of the

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000
development team, so I'm tag teaming with

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
Suda51, and I'm actually involved

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
with game creation as well as sound

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
He said that there are a few titles they're going

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
to announce soon, so stay tuned

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
There you go

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
By the way, I guess in this podcast

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
he also talked about how he almost quit

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
Konami after his first week

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Be interesting to see

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
Alright

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
I'm all for more Akira Yamaoka

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
games

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
I'm glad he didn't leave the industry altogether

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
that he's still making games

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
Silent Hill just isn't the same without him

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
Uh, yeah

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
Yeah

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
Yeah

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangetownstory.com

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
There is a little bit of a buffer, so they're still on the last story

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
So let's just pop says, Steam Valve would probably

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
say no to 90% of the shit that

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000
Xbox Live Indie games have in their store

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000
Good, I think that they should

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
But who, see, who is it to determine quality?

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000
Because I would say there's some shit

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
on Steam too

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
But one thing I do like about Steam

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
is that they provide quick links

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
to find reviews and so forth

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
And Metacritic, love it or hate it, their score

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000
is right there

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000
I think they only show it if it's above a certain score

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000
though, because it's not there for every game

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000
But kind of interesting nonetheless

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000
at 1877 Game OLR

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
The Skype line is open now for your calls

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
If you want to give us a call

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
We're going to try to keep the calls probably a little brief tonight

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
It's extraordinarily long tonight

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
We're already at a three hour show

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
and we haven't even gotten into calls yet

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
So we're going to take those calls

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
Again, that's 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000
is OrangeLoungeRadio

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
Let's see if Loki has any last minute stories

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
Not much

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:08.000
They had a

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:10.000
Tekken Bowl, I guess, was released this week

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000
for free on iOS

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000
Which is kind of lame

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
Is that like bowling with Tekken characters?

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.000
Yes it is!

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
Oh, right, right, right

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
And actually, you're right, because they're going to be

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
featuring that as well in the

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
I guess, Tekken Tag HD

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
or whatever that they're doing

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000
But yeah, you can download it for free

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
Getting it

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
Alright, our phone's ringing

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
so let's go to it

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
Hi, you're on the phone, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000
Hey, it's the one and only Rama

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
Of course, what's up Rama?

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
A whole lot of stuff

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000
Just stuff

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:48.000
What kind of stuff?

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:50.000
Love you too, Rob

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000
Love you too

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000
Well, what's up?

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
Well, first off

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
I was stoned off

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
off my tuchus last week

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
That's why I ended up with a Playstation 3

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
That's the first thing

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:08.000
You were stoned and you bought a Playstation 3?

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.000
I was so stoned off

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:12.000
my tuchus that the decision to buy one

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
was a good idea

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
Okay, so you bought a PS3

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
when you were high and you regret it now?

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.000
Actually, no

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.000
It's just an expressive blu-ray player like everybody else

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000
says, but you know

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
It has a few good games on it

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
I know

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:30.000
LittleBigPlanet, I'm telling you

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000
It's probably one of the greatest games of this generation

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000
period on either console

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:36.000
It's in the queue

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:38.000
Alright, fair enough

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:40.000
Thank you

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
Now, about this whole

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:44.000
Capcom debacle

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000
I'm probably the only

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
person that actually

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
feels that Capcom was in the right

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:52.000
to cancel the game

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:54.000
The only fuck-up was how they handled the whole

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
PR spin on the whole thing

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
I don't necessarily agree

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:00.000
that it was right, because I personally

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000
am a fan of Mega Man Legends

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000
but I am kind of trying to see it from their point of view

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:06.000
and I do understand the business perspective

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
If they don't make money, then it's not worth our time

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000
But I do agree

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000
that their biggest faux pas was how they handled it

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000
Yeah

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000
But defend yourself

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
a little bit to the fanboys

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
You're not even saying

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000
like, you're just flattered saying

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:24.000
I agree with Capcom, they should just cancel it

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:26.000
Why?

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000
In this age of money's getting kind of tight

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000
a lot of these companies, as much money as they're making

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000
we don't know how much of that is

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
revenue, profit, this or that

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000
Who knows? If they invest a lot of money

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
in making this game

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
doesn't fit the bill

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
then they're out a lot of money

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
These companies really can't afford to do that

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:46.000
And what I find interesting is that

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:50.000
there's not that many Mega Man Legends fans out there

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
Granted, if you look at the online petition

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
there's so many fans

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
but most of them are just jumping on the bandwagon

03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:00.000
just because they need a common cause to fight over

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
I will admit, I wonder how many of those people would actually

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
buy the game and how many are just wanting to pirate it

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:07.000
Because I had the first Mega Man Legends game

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
I'm not going to say it's crap

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
I thought it was a pretty good game

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
I didn't get the second one

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
because it wasn't

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
it was a good concept

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:20.000
but it just wasn't my cup of tea

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
Right

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
I kind of wish I could find the game again

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
I kind of want to play it

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000
Is it on Playstation 3 download stuff?

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000
I don't think it is

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
Anyway

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
I'm kind of surprised it wasn't

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000
It might have drummed up more interest for a third one

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
Yeah, but

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:40.000
that's how it goes

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:42.000
Yep

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:45.000
So what about other stuff going on in Capcom's world

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000
like the Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 news

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
How do you feel about that?

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
I'm amused that Phoenix Wright is in the game

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000
That is kind of awesome

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
But is it $40 awesome?

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000
I tend to think so

03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000
because I have to agree with what Rob D. said

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000
They're rebalancing the characters

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000
They're adding new stages

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000
and adding more features and functionality to make it worth the $40

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000
I mean, they kind of did the same thing

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000
when they re-released Super Street Fighter 4

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:12.000
I mean, if they did the whole $59.99 price tag

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:15.000
I sure as hell would wait until it drops to $39

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000
That's just me

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000
Which is, I think, the price point they're going to try and put it out at

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000
Mmhmm

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
Woah

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000
Sorry, I dropped my phone

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000
That wasn't good

03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000
I hope you have AppleCare on it

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
No, it's fine. No, and I don't have AppleCare either

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
It's just outside a year or two

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
So, no, it's fine. I'm good, we're good

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
Alright, anyhow

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
Well, on that note, anything else on your mind tonight?

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000
Last thing, I don't know if you heard

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
but Sears has this massive video game clearance sale

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000
at all of their stores

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
Oh, are they just unloading all of the video games altogether?

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
Yeah, but the thing is

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
your mileage may vary

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000
because I've been hitting various stores

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000
Like, I do know right now

03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000
most of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band bundles

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000
are $20

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000
Nice, Toys R Us did something like that

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000
a couple weeks ago, and I do kind of want a new Guitar Hero bundle

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:09.000
Yeah, including the big Super bundles

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000
I went to one Sears

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000
I picked up Guitar Hero Metallica

03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.000
for 96 cents, so I bought the last three

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000
Holy shit

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:19.000
For the record, by the way

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000
I don't know if you've got Big Lots

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000
I think they opened one up

03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000
by me somewhere

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000
We mostly have amazing savings

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:29.000
Dan picked up DJ Hero for me the bundle for $20

03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000
It was a couple months ago

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000
but they get them in

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000
and we found like a DDR there

03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000
for $20 with the pad and everything

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000
Nice

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000
I was thinking about picking up the DJ Hero 2 bundle

03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:43.000
and sell the turntable

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.000
and find somebody that wanted a turntable

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.000
because I already have two

03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.000
but nobody I know wants it

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000
so I was like, there's no point in me buying it

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:53.000
because I refuse to sell to

03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:55.000
the evil people, you know?

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000
Right, right

03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000
I used to put it on Craigslist

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000
It would be kinda hard too if you don't have the game, you know what I mean?

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000
But you know how that rolls

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000
Alright, well we're gonna let you go

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000
so we can get some more calls

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000
but thanks for calling, have a good one

03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000
Alright, bye-bye

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000
Let's go to the phones

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000
We got other calls coming in

03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000
Pick up the phone again

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:21.000
Hey, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.000
Hey Kaijuto, what's on your mind, buddy?

03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000
Not much, I'm gonna make it quick

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000
So, what is it, Marvel 3 now?

03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:29.000
Marvel vs Capcom 3 Ultimate, yes

03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:31.000
Yeah, my thing is

03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:33.000
Okay, so this new game

03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.000
is supposed to have more content

03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:37.000
than the original, right?

03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:39.000
And the original is $60, right?

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000
Right

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.000
And this new version is gonna be $40, right?

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000
Yes

03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000
Why not make all of those fucking fighting games $40?

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.000
That's a great question

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:51.000
Why not make all the fucking fighting games $40?

03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000
I will say this though, when I was at the

03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000
place that I will not talk about anymore

03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:57.000
I did see that they had dropped

03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000
the price of Marvel vs Capcom 3 to $40

03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000
But that certainly wasn't

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000
its price new, originally

03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:05.000
Yeah, I think

03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:07.000
To me, when I think fighting game

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000
I always think retro

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000
So I always think that those games should be

03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000
low price, I never understood

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:15.000
the $60 for Street Fighter

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000
I waited for

03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000
the second version of Street Fighter

03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000
It's dropped down to $30

03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000
Oh, then the place that shouldn't be named

03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:25.000
is just overcharging now, what a surprise

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000
I was recent, it was

03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000
Thursday, Friday

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000
Okay, well I was there Saturday and they suck

03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000
But I want to say

03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.000
this quickly though, since you brought up retro

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000
I will bring up this

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000
In 95, I think it was

03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000
when Street Fighter 2 came out for the

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000
Super Nintendo, I remember dropping $70

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.000
on that game

03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000
I spent $65 on Killer Instinct

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000
I mean, Super Nintendo games were expensive

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000
a few years ago, which

03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000
inflation and all that means

03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000
it was probably more like $100 paid for that game

03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000
So, you can't

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000
always say that fighting games have always been cheap

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000
Yeah, that's for sure

03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:03.000
But I mean, now I think they're kinda

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.000
You know, like I said

03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000
Whenever I think Street Fighter

03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000
or any of the other games, I'm always thinking

03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000
early 90s, I never think

03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000
oh, this is a new game, I always feel like it's a

03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:15.000
rehash of something that I played

03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.000
long ago, you know? I have no problem

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000
with them, but I just think they were

03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:21.000
But seriously, when Street Fighter 2 came out

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:23.000
it was the goddamn arcade

03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:25.000
at home. I mean, that translation was

03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.000
so fucking good of Street Fighter 2

03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000
Like, it was just, oh my god

03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:31.000
It just blew our minds

03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:33.000
Oh, yeah, I remember that

03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.000
I remember the first time I ever played it on the Super Nintendo

03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000
I was like, oh shit, I got the

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.000
arcade machine in my house

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000
I was like, freaking out

03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000
Anyhow, sorry

03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.000
No problem

03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.000
Yeah, you guys need to get on Minecraft

03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:49.000
The pay version, try it

03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000
I really do not like Minecraft

03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:53.000
I know, I tried, I tried

03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000
Well, at least it was the free version

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000
But even Terraria

03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000
I didn't mean to cut you off, but the free version

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000
is totally different from the pay version

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:03.000
Trust me, the pay version

03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000
We'll see, if I run out of the other games

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000
that I have, maybe I'll check it out

03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000
But I tried playing Terraria

03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000
this week, it was okay

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000
But I was like, oh wow, this really is

03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000
just Minecraft

03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000
Yeah, I kind of hit that too

03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000
I did play some in Minecraft

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000
Oh well

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000
Although Dan just showed me something interesting today

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:25.000
Someone created the whole middle earth

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.000
pretty much, in Minecraft

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:29.000
Including underground places

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000
and the whole dwarven areas and whatnot

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000
Yeah, when people take the time to do

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:35.000
that stuff, it actually comes out really interesting

03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:37.000
So, that's pretty cool

03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000
Anyway, we lost Kaijuto

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.000
We did not hang up on him

03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.000
The Skype connection crapped out

03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.000
Does that mean, let me just check on the status

03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:47.000
of the show, no, we're still streaming, so we're still up and running

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000
So unfortunately, the Kaijuto

03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.000
thing cut out, but

03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.000
I hope you had a good night, and so on

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:57.000
I'm gonna go ahead and close up Skype, I think, tonight

03:14:57.000 --> 03:14:59.000
So sorry to those of you that didn't get through, sorry it was a shorter

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:01.000
segment than usual, but we're running really long tonight

03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:03.000
So, sorry about that

03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:05.000
So we're gonna go ahead and wrap up the last minute story

03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000
so we can wrap up the show, so, Loki?

03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.000
I got nothing

03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:11.000
Well, alright then, Dark Soccer, anything?

03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:13.000
Well, Salacious Pop brought up

03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:15.000
that Capcom published Street Fighter Alpha 2

03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:17.000
for the SNES

03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:19.000
It was really sucky, and it had loading time

03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.000
Oh yeah, it was like a Super Nintendo cartridge

03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000
with loading time I own it

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:25.000
I own it Yeah? Yeah

03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:27.000
And no, I'm not gonna pay for Minecraft

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:31.000
I don't know, I might, when I run out of

03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:33.000
other games to play, I'll kinda get to that

03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:35.000
but, I still have so many games

03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:37.000
I gotta beat, and then Minecraft seems like one of those

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.000
time sinks, you spend a lot of time, but I gotta admit

03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000
I would like to explore

03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000
I like exploring worlds, especially

03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:45.000
recreations of stuff, so

03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.000
like, if there's ways to go in

03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.000
and explore that middle-earth stuff, that might be kinda fun

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000
actually, that'd be kinda cool

03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:53.000
Alright, well let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts

03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:55.000
so we can close up shop for tonight, so

03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:57.000
Loki, what's your

03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000
final thought tonight?

03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.000
My final thought is

03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:03.000
I can't wait till

03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:05.000
Tuesday

03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:07.000
I'm gonna go be brought

03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:09.000
I better fucking bring Saints for the third

03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:11.000
I'm gonna be very disappointed otherwise

03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:13.000
cause we got like a bunch of people coming in

03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:15.000
I know that we're, Ubisoft will probably

03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:17.000
bring Just Dance 3 cause they brought

03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:19.000
Just Dance 2 last year

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:21.000
THQ last year brought Smackdown vs.

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:23.000
Raw 11

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:25.000
but I think

03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000
you know, if they're bringing the biggest game

03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:29.000
it's gonna be Saints for the third

03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:31.000
and then of course, Microsoft will be there this year

03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:33.000
which is kinda cool, and I know LucasArts

03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:35.000
and the

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:37.000
Star Wars Connect game

03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:39.000
so, lots of stuff to play

03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:41.000
Well then good, I wanna hear your rundowns on it next week

03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.000
so, my final thought is

03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:45.000
this show ran long

03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.000
and it's getting late

03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:49.000
I'm getting hungry, so, it's time to go

03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:51.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:53.000
I just texted Dan that I have hungers

03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:55.000
and he needs to bring me my burger

03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:57.000
You want a taco? Oh no, you want a burger

03:16:57.000 --> 03:16:59.000
Well, Dan's bringing me a burger

03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:01.000
I don't have to pay for a burger

03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.000
I want a taco

03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:05.000
Actually, I want a fish taco

03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.000
Maybe tomorrow

03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000

When I'm scripting next week's show

03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:15.000
