00:00.000 --> 00:19.160
Tonight, July 3rd, 2011, online videos may soon make you a criminal, Nintendo spends

00:19.160 --> 00:24.000
big bucks on a new facility, and an early build of an anticipated 360 game leaks to

00:24.000 --> 00:31.560
the internet.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.440
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.440 --> 00:38.120
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.120 --> 00:43.200
We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com as we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock

00:43.200 --> 00:47.040
Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:47.040 --> 00:51.240
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts,

00:51.240 --> 00:54.520
first off, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.520
Mar.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.520
How are you?

00:56.520 --> 00:57.520
Mar mar mar.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.520
Mars?

00:58.520 --> 00:59.520
Are you offering me a Mars bar?

00:59.520 --> 01:00.520
No.

01:00.520 --> 01:01.520
I love British chocolate.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.320
I was thinking, well you can get a Snickers Dark and it's the same thing.

01:05.320 --> 01:08.200
I was, it just popped into my head about Seaman.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.320
Mar mar mar.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.400
One of the things a little Seaman says.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.520
So you're thinking about Seaman at the top of the show.

01:14.520 --> 01:15.520
Man.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.520
Okay, I see.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.080
I also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.080
Hi.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.080
How are you, Loki?

01:21.080 --> 01:22.080
Good.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.080
All right.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.000
Well, we're going to get into, of course, all the good stuff we like to do at the top

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
of the show.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.200
How was your gaming week and so forth.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.240
But I'm going to start off tonight's show with a bang and it's going to be in our chat

01:31.240 --> 01:38.720
room, chat.orangelaunge, if I even knew our website, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

01:38.720 --> 01:42.680
I'm going to give away one of my birthday presents right here, live on air, starting

01:42.680 --> 01:45.280
off the show tonight because I love the listeners that much.

01:45.280 --> 01:47.300
I'm going to share my birthday with you guys.

01:47.300 --> 01:51.200
It's an Xbox 360 game, so I'm going to give it to one of you guys in chat.

01:51.200 --> 01:57.080
So all I need you to do is whoever wants it in the chat room, say, I want Rob's 360 game.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.080
You just type that out.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.280
I want Rob's 360 game.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.320
You only say it once.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.960
If you say it more than once, you've disqualified yourself.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.320
At the end, we'll pick a number one through whatever of how many of you said, I want Rob's

02:06.320 --> 02:07.320
360 game.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.960
And we are going to give it away right here at the top of the show this week.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.840
I'll tell you more about what it is after our gaming week.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.920
See, that's what we do is a little thing called a radio tease.

02:15.920 --> 02:16.920
It's yours.

02:16.920 --> 02:17.920
It's not yours.

02:17.920 --> 02:21.320
I can say with a clean conscience is not yours.

02:21.320 --> 02:25.800
It is something I received from my birthday on the 360 and I'm giving it away, but you

02:25.800 --> 02:26.800
know what?

02:26.800 --> 02:27.800
We're a sweeten the pot a little bit.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.840
Not only are we going to give it away, I'm going to sign it.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.320
So is Dark Soccer and Loki.

02:31.320 --> 02:35.680
So it's going to be like a autographed sign it with my butt and Dark Soccer will sign

02:35.680 --> 02:36.680
it with her butt.

02:36.680 --> 02:37.680
No.

02:37.680 --> 02:38.680
All right.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.680
Yep.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.680
Give it away.

02:40.680 --> 02:41.680
Give it away now.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.680
All right.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.680
Moving on.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.680
Let's start off.

02:44.680 --> 02:45.680
How was your gaming week?

02:45.680 --> 02:49.720
I, um, played WoW.

02:49.720 --> 02:55.400
I got 50 mounts today, so now I have an albino drake.

02:55.400 --> 03:02.680
So it has a skin condition and, uh, that's about it.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.680
Next.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.680
Lol.

03:04.680 --> 03:05.760
You're addicted to WoW.

03:05.760 --> 03:06.760
Your fault.

03:06.760 --> 03:07.760
All right.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.200
Uh, then Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:09.200 --> 03:11.480
Have you been playing anything like that's not WoW?

03:11.480 --> 03:17.400
Of course I haven't been playing WoW, because I don't get WoW and nor would I want to play

03:17.400 --> 03:18.400
WoW.

03:18.400 --> 03:24.240
Um, no, I played more Grand Theft Auto this week, um, same old stuff.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.040
And then of course Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon, because it's awesome.

03:28.040 --> 03:33.400
I got that early this week and was able to play through quite a bit of it and, um, I'm

03:33.400 --> 03:38.320
happy to say it exceeds my expectations in every possible way.

03:38.320 --> 03:44.720
It is, it's just basically, you know, a very polished version of, like, Earth Defense Force

03:44.720 --> 03:53.060
2017, um, done in the U.S. and, you know, they've taken a lot of stuff that people like

03:53.060 --> 03:56.760
from other shooters and stuff kind of incorporated into the game.

03:56.760 --> 04:02.380
Um, everything seems to be more action-packed, missions seem a little bit longer, and, um,

04:02.380 --> 04:03.740
it's just, it's very fun.

04:03.740 --> 04:06.280
And the multiplayer over the internet's actually pretty fun.

04:06.280 --> 04:12.480
I've been playing a few games, uh, because I picked up a few copies of it, um, between

04:12.480 --> 04:14.800
my coworkers and it was pretty cool.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.400
Tried to play some games over the weekend, though, and was unable to connect to my other

04:18.400 --> 04:24.120
coworker that has it, but, uh, yeah, I'm definitely digging this game and highly recommend you

04:24.120 --> 04:25.120
pick it up.

04:25.120 --> 04:31.280
I mean, it's, depending on where you go, it may be out yesterday or out on Tuesday, um,

04:31.280 --> 04:34.520
there's an interesting story behind that, too.

04:34.520 --> 04:41.920
But, yeah, so, it's, it's really fun, um, you know, graphics and sound are pretty good,

04:41.920 --> 04:46.240
uh, I mean, especially when you're comparing them to Earth Defense Force, you know, the

04:46.240 --> 04:52.080
first one, it's just night and day, um, I mean, there's a little bit of slowdown, some

04:52.080 --> 04:55.960
of your AI are kind of dumb, but they're actually, uh, pretty smart this time around, they actually

04:55.960 --> 05:00.520
do a lot of work and they don't die as, you know, quite often, because you have a three-man

05:00.520 --> 05:06.240
team the entire time, whether it be with players or AI, and, uh, the different suits you can

05:06.240 --> 05:12.840
try out, those are kind of cool, um, but overall, it's just a great, great game, and I really,

05:12.840 --> 05:16.600
I love playing, in fact, I'll be playing some of it during the show, because that's what

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
I do.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.880
Uh, be careful, though, you don't want to stream it anywhere to the internet, because

05:20.880 --> 05:26.320
you might get arrested for that, but we'll get into that later in the show.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.920
So, how does this game outshine the original?

05:29.920 --> 05:30.920
How's it outshine the original?

05:30.920 --> 05:35.680
Well, the original was really, really, really buggy, and just really cheap, but it was fun

05:35.680 --> 05:39.160
because you're fighting a bunch of different things all at once.

05:39.160 --> 05:43.640
This one kind of ramps up everything, the graphics are better, um, you know, the detail

05:43.640 --> 05:48.560
in the game, like destroying buildings and stuff, it's not just, you know, kind of breaking

05:48.560 --> 05:53.680
apart and falling, I mean, they still do that, but there's a lot more ways you can interact,

05:53.680 --> 05:57.760
it breaks up the gameplay quite a bit, um, you know, you have the standard just running

05:57.760 --> 06:02.280
around shooting stuff, and then you have, like, parts where you're in a, you know, drop

06:02.280 --> 06:07.720
ship and you're manning, uh, you know, auto cannons off the side of that, or you're inside

06:07.720 --> 06:12.120
of a turret, or you're in the mechs, which, by the way, the rideable vehicles that they

06:12.120 --> 06:16.560
have in this game aren't terrible, like the first game, where they had just these mechs

06:16.560 --> 06:21.920
that moved super fucking slow, and were weak, and you just, it was kind of pointless to

06:21.920 --> 06:26.880
be inside of them, um, but this time, though, the mechs are actually pretty awesome, uh,

06:26.880 --> 06:32.880
the tank is really cool, and the turrets are pretty fun to play around with, uh, sound

06:32.880 --> 06:38.960
is actually really good in it, um, I thought, you know, it was just really action packed,

06:38.960 --> 06:43.520
um, just all the missions, seeing the, like, oh, here, you're gonna be attacked by these

06:43.520 --> 06:47.640
things, oh, and now here's this thing coming in, oh, and some drop ships just came in,

06:47.640 --> 06:52.680
and they're gonna be, uh, making your life hell, it's just, it's really overwhelming,

06:52.680 --> 06:58.240
and, uh, yet without being too difficult, and although I am playing on the normal mode

06:58.240 --> 07:02.000
right now, because I'm starting everything off normal, then going through the hard, and

07:02.000 --> 07:09.160
then the inferno, which is just insane, um, it is ramping up difficulty pretty fast, and,

07:09.160 --> 07:13.960
uh, you know, that's the thing, in each mission, whereas the first game, the missions were

07:13.960 --> 07:18.040
pretty short, and they had, like, 73 of them, this one, the missions have different, like,

07:18.040 --> 07:23.720
waypoints, different, um, things going on, and as, uh, they have, kind of, the game broken

07:23.720 --> 07:28.800
up in the chapters with different, uh, bits of the story going on, uh, like, right now,

07:28.800 --> 07:33.880
this part, I'm retrieving a package with it, ended up being some sort of alien bomb, and

07:33.880 --> 07:38.520
then I had to take out some sort of queen ant thing, and that's where I died last, but,

07:38.520 --> 07:41.920
uh, it's just, it's very, very action packed.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.560
Let's go to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, the ever present, present fourth guest here

07:45.560 --> 07:49.800
on Orange Launch Radio, uh, sha100matt says, I played Earth Defense Force 2 at PAX East,

07:49.800 --> 07:54.080
and it really just reminded me of the next gen version of the N64 game of Body Harvest.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.760
I sadly didn't like it as much as Loki likes it.

07:56.760 --> 07:59.000
Uh, Brakeman says, wait, what's going on here?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.240
Loki actually likes a game?

08:01.240 --> 08:02.240
So you don't...

08:02.240 --> 08:03.900
I like games all the time.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.960
This isn't really one that you hear about a lot, though, and clearly you're biased towards

08:07.960 --> 08:11.920
this series, you really enjoyed the first one, you like this, you're not being paid

08:11.920 --> 08:13.640
under the table by these folks, right?

08:13.640 --> 08:14.640
No.

08:14.640 --> 08:18.680
And you actually spilled the news on this a long time ago, didn't you?

08:18.680 --> 08:19.680
Yes.

08:19.680 --> 08:20.680
I seem to recall.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.040
Because I, I look for this, I'm like, whooo, whooo, whooo, whooo.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.040
You're the only one who cares.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.040
Exactly.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.040
I was like, this is kinda...

08:26.040 --> 08:29.720
Why do you think you, you know, and, and that happens in gaming sometimes.

08:29.720 --> 08:33.560
Sometimes we like a game that nobody else sees to like for unexplainable reasons.

08:33.560 --> 08:35.080
Why are you so drawn to this freaking game?

08:35.080 --> 08:36.080
It's just fun.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.880
It's, it's kinda taking games back to where, what the focus should be in any game.

08:40.880 --> 08:46.360
It's not about the great, great graphics or, you know, making sure everything's cinematic

08:46.360 --> 08:47.520
and has a great story.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.040
It's all about being fun.

08:49.040 --> 08:50.040
And that's what this is.

08:50.040 --> 08:53.360
This is basically like a popcorn action flick or something like that.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.480
The story, yeah, there's somewhat of a story there, but who gives a shit?

08:56.480 --> 09:00.800
It's just, you know, just there to move, move the game up.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.800
Yeah, exactly.

09:01.800 --> 09:06.360
It's basically, you know, you're going crazy, there's all these, you know, different bugs

09:06.360 --> 09:10.480
coming, and they even poke fun at everything, I mean, because they're like, they're all

09:10.480 --> 09:11.480
yes.

09:11.480 --> 09:15.880
This, because they call the aliens Ravagers, they're all, yes, this Ravager we've named

09:15.880 --> 09:19.960
Daddy Longlegs because it looks like a Daddy Longlegs spider.

09:19.960 --> 09:25.200
He's like, I know, it's our intelligence doesn't have a better name for it, but, you know,

09:25.200 --> 09:26.200
that's what we're calling it.

09:26.200 --> 09:31.880
And they have like a, there was a part where I got picked up by this one, this one dropship

09:31.880 --> 09:33.260
in the pilot.

09:33.260 --> 09:39.120
He's just being, doing all the like really typical, and yes, off to the left, you'll

09:39.120 --> 09:45.520
see here, there's a giant swarm of enemy, you know, and it's attacking, and you'll notice

09:45.520 --> 09:51.200
that our, that we'll be cruising at an altitude of, you know, it just like, the really-

09:51.200 --> 09:52.720
That's kind of like Starship Troopers.

09:52.720 --> 09:57.120
It is very much like Starship Troopers, just without all the, you know, propaganda in there.

09:57.120 --> 10:01.080
I mean, it's very, I don't know, it's fun.

10:01.080 --> 10:06.440
If you tried the first game and you thought, oh my god, this game is like a piece of shit

10:06.440 --> 10:09.640
as far as, you know, and granted, the first game had no physics whatsoever.

10:09.640 --> 10:14.080
I mean, you could fall from a helicopter in space and land on the ground and be just fine.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.280
I mean, there is no anything.

10:17.280 --> 10:22.280
And you know, the spaceships, when they crash, they just kind of slowly sink through the

10:22.280 --> 10:25.640
ground and you could be in the path of one of them and it just clips right through you

10:25.640 --> 10:26.640
and stuff.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.200
Well, this one, I mean, the actual ships when they crash, I mean, they will take out buildings

10:30.200 --> 10:35.240
and they will, they explode and they will possibly kill you if you're too close to it.

10:35.240 --> 10:39.080
Or like the enemy kind of spaceships that are flying around, if you're shooting them

10:39.080 --> 10:43.200
and they get damaged enough, they will actually try to kamikaze into you and try to destroy

10:43.200 --> 10:44.200
you that way.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.560
But it's just, it's ridiculous fun.

10:46.560 --> 10:47.760
That's all it is.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.880
It's a great game.

10:49.880 --> 10:53.320
And really, I mean, when you look at it in the month of July, there's not a lot coming

10:53.320 --> 10:54.320
out anyways.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.960
If you're not a fan of football, then you're left with Harry Potter and Call of Juarez,

10:58.960 --> 10:59.960
you know, the cartel.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.200
What you hear is kind of terrible.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.320
Tigerclaw in our chat room says, at least it's not Grand Theft Auto IV, which is all

11:05.320 --> 11:06.320
he ever plays.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.320
You know what?

11:07.320 --> 11:08.320
True that.

11:08.320 --> 11:13.480
I'm excited to hear Loki give an in-depth review to something else on the show for once.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.160
All right.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.760
So Dan just walked in without a mic interrupting the show saying that Shadows of the Damned

11:19.760 --> 11:20.760
is fucking hilarious.

11:20.760 --> 11:21.760
It is a fun game.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.860
I've, I've heard this is kind of a, I haven't played it at all, but I've heard it's kind

11:24.860 --> 11:26.000
of fun too.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.440
It's amazing.

11:28.440 --> 11:34.300
It's a road trip movie, a road trip movie game in hell, basically.

11:34.300 --> 11:40.420
It's like very Grindhouse-ish, but it's just, I don't know, insane.

11:40.420 --> 11:42.120
This is why people want to ban these games.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.120
All right.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.980
Uh, let's move on to my gaming week.

11:44.980 --> 11:47.920
First off, before I get to the contest, which I know you're all eagerly awaiting to see

11:47.920 --> 11:50.680
who won the contest, let me tell you about my gaming week because I did play some new

11:50.680 --> 11:51.920
games this week.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.040
First game I'm going to tell you about.

11:53.040 --> 11:57.800
On a whim, I was at Fry's the other day because I had to buy a new headset for my computer

11:57.800 --> 12:00.400
because my fat ass sat down on my old ones.

12:00.400 --> 12:06.240
Don't ask how I do that, but uh, yeah, I bought a new headset, but I saw on the shelf for

12:06.240 --> 12:13.120
40 bucks, I saw a copy of Dance Dance Revolution on the Xbox 360, which is the brand new one.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.160
This is the reboot, quote unquote, of DDR.

12:15.160 --> 12:20.200
They had the brand new game and dance pad for 40 bucks and I was like, well, you know,

12:20.200 --> 12:21.320
how bad could this possibly be?

12:21.320 --> 12:22.320
I like DDR.

12:22.320 --> 12:26.600
I, you know, obviously, OLR was built on DDR and all that, so why not?

12:26.600 --> 12:28.000
I'm going to buy this game.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.920
And I took it home and played it for a little while and I was sad because it is horrible.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.480
It is a step backward for the genre.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.840
It is just a terrible, terrible version of DDR.

12:40.840 --> 12:46.320
It is, and big parts of that I can really blame on the song list.

12:46.320 --> 12:50.660
Um, you know, I was excited when I read the back of the box and saw that Lady Gaga was

12:50.660 --> 12:53.680
in it and yes, there is a Gaga song in it and that's pretty cool.

12:53.680 --> 12:58.600
Then there's some of the Japanese DDR songs that you've come to expect, except I would

12:58.600 --> 13:04.240
say 75 percent of them were Naoki or one of his other incarnations, which, you know, back

13:04.240 --> 13:09.720
when Max, Max 2, Extreme, all of that was out, it wasn't so dominated by Naoki.

13:09.720 --> 13:14.520
I mean, granted, he's always been a huge presence in DDR, but not this bad.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.700
But then you look at some of the other licensed songs they pick.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.280
I kid you not.

13:18.280 --> 13:22.120
There's a Leona Lewis song in there because when I think dance, I think a slow jam by

13:22.120 --> 13:23.320
Leona Lewis.

13:23.320 --> 13:28.000
There was a train song in there, I think Drops of Jupiter or something, I don't know.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.800
I can't even remember the names of their songs.

13:29.800 --> 13:33.320
They all sound the same to me, the guy whines like he has a vagine.

13:33.320 --> 13:38.000
And then the song that just made me want to crinkle up my dance pad and throw it out the

13:38.000 --> 13:41.880
window, Need You Now by Lady Antebellum.

13:41.880 --> 13:48.920
That's right, that slow jam song, country, western music somehow is appropriate for DDR.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.380
And I was just like, I died inside.

13:51.380 --> 13:53.120
So the song list is terrible.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.440
The interface is set up like a, what?

13:55.440 --> 13:56.440
No wonder it was 30 bucks.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.440
It was 40.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.440
You overpaid.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.440
What's that?

13:59.440 --> 14:03.440
You overpaid.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.440
I like this.

14:04.440 --> 14:09.360
Islander in our chat says, was Rob trying to sign his computer headphones with his butt?

14:09.360 --> 14:12.540
Apparently, apparently.

14:12.540 --> 14:16.760
I mean, it's not just the song list that's offensive, but the interface is just crap.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.080
Like there's really nothing to it.

14:18.080 --> 14:21.000
The videos are just very generic videos.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.760
They didn't even like, it's just like, they didn't even try.

14:23.760 --> 14:27.820
And when you put this game next to the universe games on DDR, which granted at the time they

14:27.820 --> 14:30.600
came out, were just kind of okay.

14:30.600 --> 14:35.320
Now you don't realize how good those fucking games were compared to this.

14:35.320 --> 14:39.960
Like I actually, I've got the most value out of this game using the dance pad because my

14:39.960 --> 14:41.440
old one was long destroyed.

14:41.440 --> 14:45.120
I've been using the dance pad to go back and play DDR universe one and two.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.120
That is what I've been using.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.600
I have two of those dance pads that are still folded up.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.920
I never actually use them.

14:49.920 --> 14:55.860
They're still folded up in my closet because I got, way back in the day when we actually

14:55.860 --> 15:00.480
used to get free shit from publishers at my work.

15:00.480 --> 15:05.960
I got a couple of the dance bundles and I played the games and yeah, I didn't really

15:05.960 --> 15:06.960
care for them.

15:06.960 --> 15:07.960
I sold those.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.680
I kept the dance pads because hey, you never know when you might need a dance pad or might

15:10.680 --> 15:15.720
need to hack one apart to, you know, make a DDR heart pad.

15:15.720 --> 15:20.440
Yeah, I'm going to our chat, my chat that orange knows radio.com.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.040
I have an issue with websites tonight.

15:22.040 --> 15:26.160
Tiger class says, so what sky is trying to say, DDR three 60 is an abomination.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.320
Uh, yes.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.360
And don't forget, this is the same game that's on the PS three only.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.520
It has moved support.

15:31.520 --> 15:35.920
So whoopee, you get to wave your arms to wait, wait, but this has vision camera support.

15:35.920 --> 15:39.040
If it does, I don't know where it is because I didn't see an option for it.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.800
I thought that does the connect not read the same way as a vision cam.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.800
Yes, it should.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.800
They should.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.760
If it's in there, I didn't find it, I really didn't give a shit.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.520
Um, and it's also on the Wii.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.520
And here's the hilarious part.

15:49.520 --> 15:53.080
If you look up videos of the Wii version, the Wii version actually kind of looks like

15:53.080 --> 15:54.480
the arcade versions.

15:54.480 --> 15:58.780
I'm saying the Wii versions interface looks better than the three 60 and presumably PS

15:58.780 --> 16:00.200
three versions.

16:00.200 --> 16:06.400
So you explain that one to me, all these weird combo things that are supposed to add points.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.580
I didn't even understand.

16:07.580 --> 16:13.540
And then the mode where you unlock stuff is the club mode, which is just nonstop mode.

16:13.540 --> 16:17.720
So that the songs come nonstop and occasionally the difficulty will just randomly change in

16:17.720 --> 16:20.380
the song or the arrows will move faster, slower.

16:20.380 --> 16:26.840
And then unexplainably, the way you unlock songs is you gain meters on songs that you

16:26.840 --> 16:27.840
do well in.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.200
But if you miss steps, then you don't get as much because the difficulty would, I can't

16:31.200 --> 16:32.280
even fucking explain it.

16:32.280 --> 16:35.140
Like this game is just poopy, poopy, caca, terrible.

16:35.140 --> 16:38.720
And it makes me sad as somebody who liked DDR so much.

16:38.720 --> 16:42.640
It is time for the Dance Dance Revolution franchise to be revoked from Konami.

16:42.640 --> 16:46.480
They no longer deserve to have that franchise based on this game.

16:46.480 --> 16:52.040
I truly believe that somehow some divine being needs to come into Konami.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.880
I don't know how this happens, but somehow there needs to be a legal decision.

16:55.880 --> 17:01.000
The Supreme court should be involved in a seven, two decision to revoke DDR from Konami.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yes.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
I realize they're a Japanese company.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I don't care.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.200
It's like somehow that needs to happen where they are no longer allowed to make Dance Dance

17:07.200 --> 17:08.200
Revolution.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.200
Give it to me.

17:09.200 --> 17:17.320
I'll, I'll, I'll, you know, clothe it, you know, take it in, give it some shelter.

17:17.320 --> 17:22.200
So anyhow, by the way, by the way, while I was playing that random nonstop mode, guess

17:22.200 --> 17:26.160
what awesome DDR jam started playing?

17:26.160 --> 17:27.160
Like, yeah.

17:27.160 --> 17:31.560
Uh, because you know, sometimes there's, um, you know, there's these, there's the, the

17:31.560 --> 17:35.600
American songs you would expect to cross over, like some of the eighties classics, like,

17:35.600 --> 17:38.200
uh, you know, walk like an Egyptian and so forth.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.200
But Oh man, I just couldn't believe my ears.

17:41.200 --> 17:45.680
I always thought this was such a, uh, great dance song and I've always wanted to play

17:45.680 --> 17:58.520
this in DDR step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, die.

17:58.520 --> 17:59.520
Who is this?

17:59.520 --> 18:08.080
Oh, I don't listen to her because when I hear this song, I think DDR.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.080
Okay.

18:09.080 --> 18:13.320
And I think about anti-abortionists because it's called dance dance revolution.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.400
That's not dance music.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.200
You can't do anything other than slow dance to it.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.800
Are you gonna see someone break out into like some sort of, you know, break dance routine

18:20.800 --> 18:21.800
to that shit?

18:21.800 --> 18:22.800
No, you can't.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.680
You can't dance to it cause it's too fucking slow.

18:26.680 --> 18:27.680
Low key.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.360
Hold me tight and we'll dance to battlefield.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.000
It's the four player mode.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Hold each other's hands.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.880
Oh, Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.800
Did that have like, was it the quality?

18:38.800 --> 18:40.360
Why does love feel like a battlefield?

18:40.360 --> 18:41.360
Now?

18:41.360 --> 18:44.360
Did they have the new pads with the eight arrows or some garbage?

18:44.360 --> 18:46.800
It's the exact same fucking pad that came with the universe.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.400
Like clearly the surplus that got sent back to Konami headquarters was just packaged in

18:50.400 --> 18:52.760
this game.

18:52.760 --> 18:59.680
All right.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.000
Break man in our chat room.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.320
What the fuck is going on tonight?

19:02.320 --> 19:06.880
Loki likes games, sky is angry and dark soccer is quiet.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.640
I like games all the time.

19:08.640 --> 19:16.360
Have you heard me talk negative about saints road the third, grand theft auto, uh, motor

19:16.360 --> 19:24.920
store apocalypse, um, I'm sure there's other games in there that I liked.

19:24.920 --> 19:30.880
So I, in our chat room, uh, we have free- And, and, and this goes back a few mixes ago,

19:30.880 --> 19:35.920
but what is the fucking abomination that is the new dynamite rave?

19:35.920 --> 19:36.920
What the fuck is that?

19:36.920 --> 19:39.160
I'm not even going to, I'm not even going to try.

19:39.160 --> 19:40.840
Uh, we also have Frisbee.

19:40.840 --> 19:41.840
I'm sorry.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.840
Was it Frisbee?

19:42.840 --> 19:43.840
Yeah.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.640
Frisbee in our chat room says, this is like Kelly Clarkson in supernova PlayStation two.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.040
Well, I'm so glad you brought that up because guess what?

19:49.040 --> 19:51.080
Another one of those awesome songs in the track list is

19:51.080 --> 20:05.600
At least that's danceable at least like that one didn't, I mean, lover or a hater, at least

20:05.600 --> 20:14.480
you can kind of dance to that.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.480
That one.

20:15.480 --> 20:19.840
Not so terrible, but come on.

20:19.840 --> 20:27.120
It's, it's all right to have like one of those songs in there, but not, I get that the songs

20:27.120 --> 20:28.920
like that to cross over to mainstream audience.

20:28.920 --> 20:29.920
That's fine.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.960
I don't have a problem with that song being in DDR, but like the Jordan sparks and Leona

20:32.960 --> 20:33.960
Lewis.

20:33.960 --> 20:40.840
And I like Leona Lewis when I'm feeling sad, anyhow, let me talk about a game that was

20:40.840 --> 20:41.920
a much better investment.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.560
As you know, going on right now, steam is having a sale.

20:44.560 --> 20:47.120
Uh, there's tons and tons of stuff that's discounted on steam right now.

20:47.120 --> 20:52.320
One of the games I grabbed on sale was bit trip runner was $2 and 50 cents on steam.

20:52.320 --> 20:56.640
Um, somehow I stepped into the twilight zone where that's the game I should have paid $40

20:56.640 --> 21:01.840
for and DDR was worth about $2 and 50 cents because bit trip runner is cool.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.400
And like, I wasn't expecting a whole lot of out of this game cause you know, bit trip

21:05.400 --> 21:09.920
beat was neat, but it kind of like the shtick got old pretty fast.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.880
So the whole pong thing, um, but I liked bit trip runner a lot.

21:13.880 --> 21:18.400
Like it really reminds me of an old school 2,600 game, like what it would look like today

21:18.400 --> 21:23.320
with the chip to music, very simple controls, but a lot of that whole kind of repetition

21:23.320 --> 21:29.440
about how to learn to beat a level and, and, uh, I even throwbacks to the classic Atari

21:29.440 --> 21:34.400
console with the whole, uh, bonus levels looking like pitfall complete with a noisy television.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.840
Like if you've ever tried to hook up, uh, on an old TV with the RF switch, you get that

21:38.840 --> 21:40.760
noise in there mixed with your game.

21:40.760 --> 21:43.840
Like I just loved the way it looked like a bit trip runner was a great deal.

21:43.840 --> 21:48.760
For two 50, I played more of that game than I did the $40 DDR game.

21:48.760 --> 21:49.760
Just say him.

21:49.760 --> 21:54.480
So bit trip runner, I endorsed that game, especially if you could call it a music game

21:54.480 --> 21:58.600
cause yeah, it involves chip tunes, but to me that's kind of the niche that makes it

21:58.600 --> 21:59.600
that much more awesome.

21:59.600 --> 22:02.800
Like to me, it's just like a classic Atari game.

22:02.800 --> 22:08.720
What it would look like today, just the chip tune element makes it attractive to those

22:08.720 --> 22:13.600
that maybe don't always care for the simplistic games, if that makes sense.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.240
So, um, let's see, anything else I played this week?

22:16.240 --> 22:17.240
I checked out some demos.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.600
I don't always like to review games based on the demos, but I'll quickly say I checked

22:20.600 --> 22:26.520
out the 32nd hero super mega Neo climax, uh, game on the Xbox 360.

22:26.520 --> 22:28.720
I own the PSP version of that.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.480
So I wanted to see what it looked like on 360.

22:30.480 --> 22:34.880
I like how the 360 has the completely different art modes that look completely different.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.080
They have the cell shaded hand drawn mode, which is pretty cool, but they also have the

22:38.080 --> 22:42.740
retro mode, which looks more like the PSP version or an eight bit Nintendo classic.

22:42.740 --> 22:44.640
So that, that was pretty cool.

22:44.640 --> 22:50.160
Um, let's see, uh, and, um, what was the other demo I played?

22:50.160 --> 22:51.760
Oh, Galaga legions DX.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.000
I think I'm going to buy that one.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.500
That one was really cool.

22:54.500 --> 23:00.440
That was kind of like geometry wars with the whole Pac-Man championship edition elements

23:00.440 --> 23:01.680
in it with the music and everything.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.040
Cause by the same team, if I'm not mistaken, but it played a little more like geometry

23:05.040 --> 23:09.260
wars, but it doesn't play like the old Galaga games at all.

23:09.260 --> 23:12.140
So I thought that was kind of neat.

23:12.140 --> 23:16.440
Going to our chat room at a chat dot orange lounge, radio.com, uh, Izzam in our chat room

23:16.440 --> 23:19.640
says bit trip is more rhythm puzzle than anything else.

23:19.640 --> 23:24.040
Yeah, I could see that I rhythm puzzle, I think is a good way to describe it.

23:24.040 --> 23:29.280
Um, let's see, uh, going into our chat room, uh, black Wolf says, Hey, that's not the Glee

23:29.280 --> 23:30.280
version.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.300
That sucks.

23:31.300 --> 23:34.360
And break man says, I hear Glee versions of songs every time I go to target.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.360
Yeah.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.360
That's the other awesome music franchise.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.360
The Konami is doing right now.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.360
Glee karaoke revolution.

23:38.360 --> 23:39.360
Awesome.

23:39.360 --> 23:40.360
But you know what?

23:40.360 --> 23:44.320
I, it sells for them, I guess.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.920
I mean, I don't know.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.480
Yeah, I don't know either.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.480
All right.

23:49.480 --> 23:56.760
So I bet you all are dying to know more about, um, the game that I'm giving away here on

23:56.760 --> 23:57.760
the program.

23:57.760 --> 24:02.320
Uh, at the top of the show, I said, uh, who wants to win my birthday present?

24:02.320 --> 24:06.080
And we are going to give that away, but to tell us more about, uh, the birthday present,

24:06.080 --> 24:08.740
uh, I'm going to call the person who bought it for me.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.960
And this is my significant other salacious pop that we're going to bring on the line.

24:11.960 --> 24:12.960
Yes, that's right.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.760
I'm giving away the present that my significant other bought for me.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.320
And we're gonna talk about why.

24:17.320 --> 24:23.240
Um, he actually ordered a copy of a child of Eden for me online.

24:23.240 --> 24:27.720
And I want to talk about why we are giving away once it arrived, while we're giving it

24:27.720 --> 24:28.720
away.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.720
Hi.

24:29.720 --> 24:30.720
Yeah.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.720
Hey, how you doing?

24:31.720 --> 24:32.720
I'm doing all right.

24:32.720 --> 24:33.720
All right.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.560
So we're giving away a game on tonight's show and it's a present you bought me for my birthday.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.080
Now you went to buy me a copy of child of Eden, right?

24:39.080 --> 24:40.080
Yes.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.080
All right.

24:41.080 --> 24:45.360
So tell the listeners about how we get from your buying me child of Eden on my birthday

24:45.360 --> 24:48.640
to me giving away my present here on the show.

24:48.640 --> 24:54.240
Well, I decided that that was definitely what you needed to get for your birthday.

24:54.240 --> 24:59.500
So I went on a hunt online to try and find it at a good price because I wasn't really

24:59.500 --> 25:04.800
prepared to, um, you know, drop the 60 bones or whatever it costs at target.

25:04.800 --> 25:10.520
So I checked out Amazon and a bunch of other sites and I just wasn't happy with, you know,

25:10.520 --> 25:13.320
how, uh, what they were offering it for.

25:13.320 --> 25:16.120
So I ended up, uh, through Google shopping.

25:16.120 --> 25:21.000
I ended up on eBay and I'm sure already some people in studio might know where this story

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
is going.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.640
Um, I found a lot of retailers with tens of thousands of feedback, positive score that

25:26.640 --> 25:30.920
I could have got it from, but I found this one sort of dog and pony show seller with

25:30.920 --> 25:36.380
a feedback score of five or six, um, selling child of Eden and a bunch of other games like

25:36.380 --> 25:41.480
halo reach and you know, Madden 11 and a bunch of other stuff new, um, shrink wrapped in

25:41.480 --> 25:44.120
America for what I thought was a good price.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.720
And at least it was a feedback of one or higher.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.680
It wasn't some new eBay account, right?

25:48.680 --> 25:52.600
It was like, yeah, it was five, um, which is still pretty low for the fact that they

25:52.600 --> 25:54.640
have like 80 auctions running at once.

25:54.640 --> 25:59.320
So I was like, all right, I am going to give this a shot and I sell a ton of stuff on eBay

25:59.320 --> 26:01.200
and I take it very seriously.

26:01.200 --> 26:06.820
So I think I kind of projected the fact that I'm a legit EJ seller onto this stranger person.

26:06.820 --> 26:14.000
So um, I buy it and three days later when I get my tracking number, I see that for one

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I noticed that they closed their account.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.160
So they've unregistered from eBay and their feedback score is now zero.

26:20.160 --> 26:26.800
Um, and I look at the tracking number and it is from China and anyone who ever orders

26:26.800 --> 26:31.240
anything on eBay knows that if your item comes from China, it is a counterfeit.

26:31.240 --> 26:36.640
It's a bootleg because the piracy market over in China and Taiwan is millions and millions

26:36.640 --> 26:38.640
of dollars of counterfeit titles.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.960
So I was like, well shit, it's going to take this game three weeks to get to me and it's

26:42.960 --> 26:45.120
obviously fake.

26:45.120 --> 26:50.520
So uh, it arrived on Thursday, I open it and here's the punchline.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.900
Yes, it is a counterfeit.

26:52.900 --> 26:58.920
Obviously it's, it's, I'm surprised at how good the quality is, but it's not good enough.

26:58.920 --> 27:02.800
Like you can tell like, wow, they, they printed this on a very high quality, expensive color

27:02.800 --> 27:03.800
laser printer.

27:03.800 --> 27:07.640
Yeah, it definitely looks like a color copy like, but, but it's very, it's, it's very

27:07.640 --> 27:08.640
high quality.

27:08.640 --> 27:12.040
But if you look closely, you can just, you can just kind of see that ink, inkjet, little

27:12.040 --> 27:13.440
dotting, you know, you know what I mean?

27:13.440 --> 27:17.320
If you ever look at an original and an inkjet side by side, you can tell the difference.

27:17.320 --> 27:18.320
Yeah.

27:18.320 --> 27:22.360
So, um, it obviously it's a counterfeit and if you look at the underside of the disc,

27:22.360 --> 27:26.520
you can see that it's, you know, like a DVD are that they, you know, just bought a huge

27:26.520 --> 27:27.980
spindle of them.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.160
But the game wasn't even a counterfeit child of Eden.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.440
It was a counterfeit pal edition.

27:33.440 --> 27:38.560
So they bootlegged the European version of Assassin's Creed brotherhood.

27:38.560 --> 27:46.080
So it's a bootleg game from China that the pal version whammy number two, that's the

27:46.080 --> 27:48.200
wrong counterfeit game from what I ordered.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.200
Whammy number three.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.360
So that is some yackety sacks, Benny Hill theme shit right there.

27:53.360 --> 27:57.280
So we want to give, and before we had the call tonight, I asked you to pick a number

27:57.280 --> 28:02.680
from one to, um, of all the people in chat who said that they wanted my 360 games.

28:02.680 --> 28:11.800
So we want to congratulate Kaijuto won a copy bootleg copy of Assassin's Creed brotherhood

28:11.800 --> 28:22.560
pal edition on the Xbox 360 signed by dark soccer is, but my birthday present because

28:22.560 --> 28:26.080
I care about the listeners, I am giving away my birthday present.

28:26.080 --> 28:31.320
So yeah, I opened a case for it on eBay and I'm confident that I'm going to get my money

28:31.320 --> 28:32.320
back.

28:32.320 --> 28:37.720
Um, the price that I got it for was sort of in that nebulous too good to be true, but

28:37.720 --> 28:40.800
I could see someone selling the game for cheap at this amount.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.520
So even if I get screwed over, which I doubt I will, it's not a horrible heartbreaking

28:44.520 --> 28:47.920
amount of money, but not come on eBay.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.900
It's not completely unreasonable for someone to sell stuff for cheap.

28:49.900 --> 28:55.760
For example, I take games sometimes that I get for free and I just don't want them and

28:55.760 --> 28:56.960
I don't really care what I get for them.

28:56.960 --> 29:00.240
So I started the auction at one penny and whatever they end at, that's what they sell

29:00.240 --> 29:01.240
for.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.760
So a lot of times, you know, I think a brink was one that went recently.

29:04.760 --> 29:09.400
It went for $24 so it's not unreasonable for that to happen.

29:09.400 --> 29:12.560
Of course, my self, my feedback rating is not five.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.080
It is much higher than that.

29:14.080 --> 29:18.400
But you know, yeah, mine's like 86 and you can actually click on the history and see

29:18.400 --> 29:19.400
what they are.

29:19.400 --> 29:24.320
But yeah, when I had it, when I had a bunch of, um, uh, adult DVDs from that job, I had

29:24.320 --> 29:28.480
like dozens of them that were shrink wrapped that cost, you know, 60 bucks down at the

29:28.480 --> 29:29.480
bookstore.

29:29.480 --> 29:33.000
I sold them on the adult section of eBay for a penny and some of them only went for 10

29:33.000 --> 29:35.960
bucks and they were perfectly brand new retail good items.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.480
So I absolutely understand how that could happen.

29:38.480 --> 29:42.160
So you thought maybe you'd find somebody like you who was just giving away their excess

29:42.160 --> 29:48.040
promo copies of child of Eden, but unfortunately you got a pal copy that's not even real of

29:48.040 --> 29:50.360
Assassin's Creed of the game that I didn't order.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.360
Yeah, exactly.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.240
So tiger claw in our chat room says, what's the moral of the story?

29:54.240 --> 29:56.360
Don't order from Amazon.

29:56.360 --> 29:57.840
Actually I think you got the moral mixed up.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.780
It's it's it's don't order from eBay.

30:00.780 --> 30:06.620
Order from a quote legit store like Amazon or Best Buy or fries or whatever the hell

30:06.620 --> 30:07.620
you want.

30:07.620 --> 30:13.320
Usually, even though, even though PayPal is evil, usually when it comes to shit like this,

30:13.320 --> 30:15.320
they usually side with the buyer.

30:15.320 --> 30:21.120
So yeah, and there are lots of legit reseller or sellers on eBay that have their own website,

30:21.120 --> 30:24.320
but they all just have an eBay account and you'll know that they're legit because their

30:24.320 --> 30:28.080
feedback score is in the tens of thousands and those are the ones that you should stick

30:28.080 --> 30:29.080
to.

30:29.080 --> 30:32.700
So a break man in our chat room says, wait, WTF, if I would ever try to give away a gift

30:32.700 --> 30:34.720
from my girl, she would fucking kill me.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.720
So are you going to fucking kill me?

30:37.720 --> 30:42.380
Well we've we found an even better solution to get you your child of Eden fix and I get

30:42.380 --> 30:43.380
to play it too.

30:43.380 --> 30:45.460
So no, I'm not, I'm not too heartbroken over this.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.640
And we can go ahead and share what we ended up doing instead.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.840
It's actually kind of in an ironic way.

30:49.840 --> 30:50.840
It's actually kind of funny.

30:50.840 --> 30:51.840
This worked out this way.

30:51.840 --> 30:52.840
Yeah.

30:52.840 --> 30:56.480
I'm a listener of O.L.R.

30:56.480 --> 31:02.520
I'm what I'm trying to think of his name is a screen name.

31:02.520 --> 31:09.680
Mieglotov called us today told us that on best buy.com or the brick and mortar store

31:09.680 --> 31:15.620
if you have one nearby for today and tomorrow, connect games are two for one.

31:15.620 --> 31:21.200
So we picked up child of Eden and a fitness game that looked like a fitness game that

31:21.200 --> 31:23.040
wasn't actually horrible.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.040
We got both of those.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.560
So that's, that's your birthday present or those two games.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.880
So I ended up getting a two for one deal on which fitness game, I think the year fitness.

31:29.880 --> 31:30.880
Oh, that's not bad.

31:30.880 --> 31:31.880
Yeah.

31:31.880 --> 31:32.880
I mean, I trust me.

31:32.880 --> 31:33.880
We looked.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.600
We're like, okay, Zumba fitness is the one that's selling really well in Europe.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.600
Went to Metacritic.

31:36.600 --> 31:41.440
It's 40 something unless you like Latin dancing and I'm talking about Latin female dancing.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.320
I do like Latin female dancing.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.040
Yeah, it was.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.040
Yeah.

31:46.040 --> 31:50.120
Your shape fitness evolved, which I think is like a 74 on Metacritic fitness game.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.120
That's pretty good.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.120
That was pretty good.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.320
They have the sequel coming out this year, but we purposely, we just kind of went to

31:54.320 --> 31:56.460
Metacritic and pick, pick the one with the best score.

31:56.460 --> 31:57.880
So, and that's the one we went with.

31:57.880 --> 32:00.780
So we're like, well, let's get a fitness game because I've actually kind of been into fitness

32:00.780 --> 32:03.240
and all that stuff lately, like trying to walk more, eat better.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.980
I've lost seven pounds in the past two months, so I kind of want to keep that trend going

32:05.980 --> 32:08.600
without having to join a gym, join a gym.

32:08.600 --> 32:09.960
So be cool.

32:09.960 --> 32:16.360
Uh, also, uh, break man in chat says, so basically someone wins Sky's coffee table drink coaster.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.520
Hey, I never said it was a good game.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.960
Why do you think I was given it away?

32:21.960 --> 32:26.080
But Kaijuto says I will put that game up on a plaque, so I'm glad someone, uh, won it

32:26.080 --> 32:27.520
who will appreciate it.

32:27.520 --> 32:28.520
So congratulations.

32:28.520 --> 32:34.040
Once again, you win my birthday bootleg pal copy of the wrong fucking game, Assassin's

32:34.040 --> 32:40.320
Creed brotherhood signed by myself, Loki and Dark Sakura's butt.

32:40.320 --> 32:44.640
And uh, I think doesn't Loki probably has a system somewhere that would play it.

32:44.640 --> 32:45.760
That was actually my first reaction.

32:45.760 --> 32:49.400
I'm like, one of Loki's like 10, three sixties could probably play this game.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.280
I don't have 10, three sixties.

32:51.280 --> 32:58.560
No, my, my J tag, which, which by the way, I broke this week, but I will be fixing it.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.600
Um, yes, that would probably be able to play that.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.200
But Loki, I've decided I'm going to give it to a listener instead.

33:04.200 --> 33:07.480
In fact, uh, Dan's J tag out there probably could play it.

33:07.480 --> 33:08.480
All right.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.480
Well, Oh, well.

33:09.480 --> 33:10.480
All right.

33:10.480 --> 33:13.400
Uh, slashes pop while we have you on anything else you want to share with the listeners?

33:13.400 --> 33:18.280
Um, just that really insane steam sale that's running, I think all week people need to get

33:18.280 --> 33:19.280
on that.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.280
Some great stuff on there.

33:20.280 --> 33:21.280
Yes.

33:21.280 --> 33:22.280
Indeed.

33:22.280 --> 33:23.280
Yeah.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.280
And win tickets and join the OLR group while you're on there.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.280
Hurray.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.280
Yeah.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.280
Yep.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.280
More information.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.280
Orange owns radio.com.

33:29.280 --> 33:30.280
Okay.

33:30.280 --> 33:31.280
Take care.

33:31.280 --> 33:32.280
Uh, thank you.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.280
Salacious pop.

33:33.280 --> 33:34.280
Bye.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.280
Bye.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.280
And it really is one of those situations where it's the thought that counts.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.280
Like I just laughed it off.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.880
Like I kind of knew he was getting me child of Eden because when I tried to buy it in

33:38.880 --> 33:42.840
the store, he's like, don't you want to wait till after your birthday to buy any big purchases

33:42.840 --> 33:43.840
like that?

33:43.840 --> 33:45.600
You know, that, that whole little thing.

33:45.600 --> 33:50.820
So I kind of knew that was coming, but you know, it, the story behind it is even better

33:50.820 --> 33:52.920
than just the game showing up on the doorstep.

33:52.920 --> 33:58.120
You know, and you, you even said ahead of time that you felt or that Alan felt something

33:58.120 --> 33:59.120
like that might happen.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.120
Yeah, no.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.680
Well, he knew right away when he bought the game off eBay, but we were all just kind of

34:02.680 --> 34:03.680
waiting to see.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.600
So we thought we turned it into something fun, like a giveaway.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.360
So I'll get in touch with you guys, you know, a little later and we'll get your address.

34:09.360 --> 34:13.160
Um, probably ship it out after next week's show because I didn't bring it to the show

34:13.160 --> 34:14.160
tonight.

34:14.160 --> 34:15.160
So we got to get everyone to actually sign it.

34:15.160 --> 34:16.160
All right.

34:16.160 --> 34:19.120
Anyhow, um, let's move on quickly housekeeping.

34:19.120 --> 34:24.200
Uh, if you want to, uh, sign up for our Facebook, you should facebook.com slash orange launch

34:24.200 --> 34:25.200
radio.

34:25.200 --> 34:29.280
Also we're on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. And as I mentioned before, uh, if you

34:29.280 --> 34:33.280
go to orange lounge radio.com and you are getting in on these steam sales or what have

34:33.280 --> 34:38.000
you, the more of you that are getting into steam for team fortress two or portal to your

34:38.000 --> 34:42.400
copies on PS three that work on steam, what have you, uh, we actually do have our home,

34:42.400 --> 34:46.760
our own little steam community, and you can see that on our website, orange launch radio.com

34:46.760 --> 34:53.280
on the left hand side is a little button for steam, uh, in the extended play section, steam

34:53.280 --> 34:58.120
community.com slash groups slash O L R. So there you go.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.120
All right.

34:59.120 --> 35:01.040
Um, let's get into tonight's news.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.040
There actually is a lot of gaming news too this week.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.520
Uh, so let's get right into it.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.520
Loki, start us off.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.520
What's going on in the news.

35:06.520 --> 35:07.520
Uh, yes.

35:07.520 --> 35:12.360
Um, we talked a little bit about this on our teas with, um, Bobby, but a resident evil

35:12.360 --> 35:18.560
mercenary 3d just came out last week and there was a big controversy over the fact that Capcom

35:18.560 --> 35:19.600
decided, Hey, guess what?

35:19.600 --> 35:24.900
You know that save game that, uh, data that you have on there, it cannot be reset.

35:24.900 --> 35:30.760
So for example, say you get really far in the game and you decide to sell it and then

35:30.760 --> 35:35.320
the next person that buys it, uh, they're stuck with your save game and having everything

35:35.320 --> 35:37.640
being unlocked.

35:37.640 --> 35:43.320
Um, it was funny because actually at one point GameStop and a lot of the major retailers

35:43.320 --> 35:46.560
out there were not going to be taking the game in as a trade.

35:46.560 --> 35:51.600
I guess, um, they've reversed their policy on that, but, um, you know, they're saying

35:51.600 --> 35:56.520
if upon further review the process with our publishing, our publisher partner, Capcom,

35:56.520 --> 36:03.160
uh, GameStop will resume taking trades on the game effective Wednesday, June 29th makes

36:03.160 --> 36:12.080
me wonder a couple things here, one, um, so GameStop probably bitched the Capcom to it's

36:12.080 --> 36:13.720
all okay all of a sudden.

36:13.720 --> 36:18.120
So it makes you wonder if they either they're just fine with the fact that you can't reset

36:18.120 --> 36:23.000
your save or there's maybe like a key combination or something like that where GameStop can

36:23.000 --> 36:28.720
reset your save, which if that were the case, it'd probably go interesting.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.840
I didn't know if, if that's the case that will leak out in seconds.

36:31.840 --> 36:36.880
That'll be on GameFacts.com within five seconds of that code being given to a GameStop employee.

36:36.880 --> 36:41.280
Um, overseas though it says a retailer HMV has ceased taking trades in for the title.

36:41.280 --> 36:47.200
EB Games Australia has also stopped stocking the game altogether and, um, you know, they're

36:47.200 --> 36:51.480
just saying if, you know, EB Games, I guess, if you would like to purchase it with us and

36:51.480 --> 36:55.800
of course we will sell it to you, it will be a case of an order within our, or with

36:55.800 --> 36:56.800
our store.

36:56.800 --> 37:02.360
And it says we made, we made the tough decision to remove it from sale because we had everybody's

37:02.360 --> 37:06.880
best interest in mind and don't feel that it's fair that you guys would be paying, this

37:06.880 --> 37:13.440
is $60 Australian, for what is essentially one, a one use game.

37:13.440 --> 37:17.800
So I mean, let's, let's get back to the root problem here because amongst the whole ninth

37:17.800 --> 37:21.480
anniversary show and the fact that this news kind of came out on a Sunday last week, we

37:21.480 --> 37:23.400
kind of overlooked this story.

37:23.400 --> 37:28.920
Um, in what fucking universe was this a good game design idea to not reset the save file?

37:28.920 --> 37:36.440
Like I, I, I get the defense is the whole, well it's like an arcade game and I, I, I'm

37:36.440 --> 37:37.880
just saying that is the defense.

37:37.880 --> 37:41.560
I'm not saying I understand it, but that is the whole like, well it's, it's like an arcade

37:41.560 --> 37:43.420
game and it's not detrimental.

37:43.420 --> 37:44.560
So what?

37:44.560 --> 37:49.920
Like I hate it when game companies try to tell me what I want as a gamer because that's

37:49.920 --> 37:51.080
what the gamers want.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.760
No, I'm telling you that's not what I want.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.600
I do sometimes like to reset my games and start from scratch.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.360
I did it on Final Fantasy 13 a few weeks ago.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.560
It's like an arcade game.

38:00.560 --> 38:01.560
Okay.

38:01.560 --> 38:02.560
That's your defense sin.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.960
Arcade cabinets, I can reset the goddamn high score.

38:04.960 --> 38:08.880
In fact, Capcom arcade games, I can reset the high score on.

38:08.880 --> 38:13.000
So where's your logic there?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
It doesn't make sense.

38:14.000 --> 38:20.440
I mean, clearly somebody made this decision and I think this decision absolutely was made

38:20.440 --> 38:25.240
to impact the used market because somebody made a conscious decision not to let the game

38:25.240 --> 38:32.480
save to the 3DS card internal memory like all the other freaking 3DS games do where

38:32.480 --> 38:36.300
if you wanted to reset your data, oh, it's as easy as deleting the file.

38:36.300 --> 38:38.200
How easy is that?

38:38.200 --> 38:40.400
Somebody made the conscious decision, no, we don't want to do that.

38:40.400 --> 38:47.840
We're specifically moving it to the cart and not making it deleteable.

38:47.840 --> 38:51.560
But now they've come up with all this crap to kind of back talk their way into how that

38:51.560 --> 38:55.560
was a great decision and it's where the game industry is going.

38:55.560 --> 38:56.560
It's really what you wanted.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.260
Yeah, it's what we wanted.

38:58.260 --> 39:00.800
You wanted an arcade experience, didn't you?

39:00.800 --> 39:06.120
No, I didn't really want to play the mercenary missions from 4 and 5 ported to the 3DS.

39:06.120 --> 39:08.920
I would like, you know, I don't know, maybe a new Resident Evil game.

39:08.920 --> 39:09.920
Oh, but guess what?

39:09.920 --> 39:14.800
You can play the demo for the new Resident Evil game on this game itself.

39:14.800 --> 39:18.980
So I guess there's something to it.

39:18.980 --> 39:23.760
But once again, you know, I mean to be fair, it didn't get very good reviews because apparently

39:23.760 --> 39:25.660
the game wasn't that great.

39:25.660 --> 39:29.040
And so, you know, I don't really consider it a big loss.

39:29.040 --> 39:33.360
It's interesting though because this new story yet has people talking about it.

39:33.360 --> 39:37.600
And despite the fact it was a mediocre game that probably, you know, the Resident Evil

39:37.600 --> 39:40.840
fans would have been, yay, but most other people would have been like, bring on the

39:40.840 --> 39:42.360
other 3DS games.

39:42.360 --> 39:48.800
It's another, you know, another entry in the long line of bad DRM decisions from Capcom.

39:48.800 --> 39:53.680
You know, if it's not, oh, this game needs to be online at all times, you know, in order

39:53.680 --> 39:58.480
for it to work even in single player, or like in games that don't even have a multiplayer

39:58.480 --> 40:02.180
component, oh, you know, and then the PlayStation Network goes down and their game stops working

40:02.180 --> 40:04.080
for, you know, a month or whatever.

40:04.080 --> 40:07.600
Alright, so I'm being corrected by the chat room, as tends to happen sometimes on this

40:07.600 --> 40:08.600
show.

40:08.600 --> 40:12.640
And the chat says, actually Rob, none of the 3DS games I have saved to the SD card.

40:12.640 --> 40:16.200
They all save to the 3DS cart, but you can do data management.

40:16.200 --> 40:20.160
The only things that save to the SD cart are the street pass and maybe data that won't

40:20.160 --> 40:21.220
fit on the cart.

40:21.220 --> 40:22.220
So fine.

40:22.220 --> 40:26.600
I just haven't noticed because there hasn't really been that big RPG 3DS game that I've

40:26.600 --> 40:29.300
wanted to reset the data on so far.

40:29.300 --> 40:34.860
I mean, when all is said and done, would I probably really want to reset the data on

40:34.860 --> 40:36.360
a game like this?

40:36.360 --> 40:37.360
Probably not.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.360
Me personally.

40:38.360 --> 40:39.360
Probably not.

40:39.360 --> 40:42.740
I probably wouldn't have noticed this if it hadn't been called out.

40:42.740 --> 40:46.920
But what ticks me off about it is this whole, we all see what you're doing, quit trying

40:46.920 --> 40:49.400
to make excuses to say otherwise.

40:49.400 --> 40:52.800
Like it's very obvious why they're doing this.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.800
Stop lying.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.720
It's because they don't want to piss off the fans.

40:55.720 --> 41:01.040
They want to piss off the fans because they're trying to do this to save some money.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.400
Then they are assuming that their fans are stupid and you should be offended.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.320
And really how much money are they saving?

41:06.320 --> 41:11.120
Because this game itself is probably going to sell, what, maybe 400,000 units?

41:11.120 --> 41:16.480
And that right there is a really generous estimate.

41:16.480 --> 41:20.480
I mean, 400,000 units in the lifetime of this game.

41:20.480 --> 41:27.280
I mean, we're talking like maybe a few 10,000 copies or whatever that they're going to lose

41:27.280 --> 41:30.940
out sales on because someone's going to buy it used.

41:30.940 --> 41:39.200
And of saying like 25% of those copies are going to sell for used or something like that.

41:39.200 --> 41:42.680
How many people are you really turning away from putting this feature on there?

41:42.680 --> 41:45.960
I mean, what, maybe let's just say 10,000 of those people.

41:45.960 --> 41:51.360
That's such a minor, minor, minor number compared to people are just not going to give a shit

41:51.360 --> 41:52.800
or they just won't buy your game.

41:52.800 --> 41:56.440
I mean, I don't know.

41:56.440 --> 41:57.440
It's stupid.

41:57.440 --> 42:02.000
Black Wolf in our chat room says, hey, this is an investment opportunity, buy five copies

42:02.000 --> 42:06.440
this week, save them for three years and sell them as unopened on eBay for a hundred dollars

42:06.440 --> 42:07.440
each profit.

42:07.440 --> 42:08.440
I don't know.

42:08.440 --> 42:11.880
I don't know if that will work if the game is only kind of mediocre.

42:11.880 --> 42:15.640
However, I say at the end of the day, vote with your wallet.

42:15.640 --> 42:17.320
That's really what it boils down to.

42:17.320 --> 42:21.340
Now, to be honest, I probably wouldn't have bought this game anyway, but I especially

42:21.340 --> 42:24.560
wouldn't have bought, like if I was on the fence, I would have said, no, I don't really

42:24.560 --> 42:25.560
want to support this.

42:25.560 --> 42:29.480
Well, that's what was going through my head the whole time is why the crap would I buy

42:29.480 --> 42:30.480
that game?

42:30.480 --> 42:32.880
There hasn't been a good resident evil game since three.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.400
Oh, come on.

42:34.400 --> 42:35.400
Four.

42:35.400 --> 42:36.400
I like it.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.400
Oh, Oh my God.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.600
That's one of the best GameCube games, period.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.920
Like I realize everybody has their own opinion.

42:41.920 --> 42:42.920
That's fine.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.640
But I, I, I cannot agree with you.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.440
My favorite to this day is still two.

42:47.440 --> 42:51.480
I four was like one of the best and I really liked Code Veronica.

42:51.480 --> 42:52.480
Period.

42:52.480 --> 42:53.480
Wow.

42:53.480 --> 42:54.480
All right.

42:54.480 --> 42:58.080
I can't agree that five was not what it could have five was not anyhow.

42:58.080 --> 42:59.080
Uh, yeah.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.640
Vote with your wallet kids.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.040
That's really what it boils down to.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.040
All right.

43:03.040 --> 43:09.540
Now, speaking of, uh, fun money related decisions and what you support and what you don't, where

43:09.540 --> 43:11.400
the industry is going.

43:11.400 --> 43:14.920
Last week on the show, we talked about the impending Supreme court decision and I got

43:14.920 --> 43:18.880
to admit we were a little bit in the, you know, negative defeatist drone last week where

43:18.880 --> 43:22.680
we were pretty sure that it was going to come out and that the Supreme court was going to

43:22.680 --> 43:28.200
uphold the California law and this vague ass law about what is deemed offensive or whatever

43:28.200 --> 43:33.280
would end up with a GameStop employees getting thousand dollar fines and all this crap.

43:33.280 --> 43:37.700
Well, the good news is the Supreme court actually ruled the other way.

43:37.700 --> 43:40.040
They ruled in favor of the video game industry.

43:40.040 --> 43:45.520
They overturned the law, so to speak, which really was never essentially effective.

43:45.520 --> 43:51.520
Uh, so in Brown versus entertainment merchants association, which used to be Schwarzenegger

43:51.520 --> 43:54.760
versus entertainment merchants association, but you know, we've had a new governor since

43:54.760 --> 43:56.560
the law first went into effect.

43:56.560 --> 44:00.060
Um, it was reversed in seven to decision.

44:00.060 --> 44:05.360
So, uh, they are essentially saying that, yeah, it is a violation of the first amendment

44:05.360 --> 44:06.360
and so forth.

44:06.360 --> 44:09.800
But there were a couple of justices that seemed to be on the fence with this whole thing.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.560
I'm not going to go super, super in depth.

44:11.560 --> 44:13.840
I think a lot of you already kind of read about this.

44:13.840 --> 44:17.160
It was such a huge thing, but there were a couple of justices that were on the fence

44:17.160 --> 44:22.320
with this that were saying like, we understand why there might be a law, just this wasn't

44:22.320 --> 44:23.520
really the way to do it.

44:23.520 --> 44:27.240
The way you're defining offensive here is a little vague, you know, things like that.

44:27.240 --> 44:32.360
So you know, is this all going to be said and done and over with?

44:32.360 --> 44:33.880
I guarantee you it's not.

44:33.880 --> 44:38.600
In fact, there was some reaction this week from Leland Yee, who was the state Senator

44:38.600 --> 44:41.760
who originally drafted this whole bill in the first place.

44:41.760 --> 44:48.080
Uh, he's a Democrat, a Democrat representing San Francisco and, uh, he put together a whole

44:48.080 --> 44:53.080
little statement that said that the ruling of the Supreme Court, quote, puts the interests

44:53.080 --> 44:56.320
of corporate America before the interests of children.

44:56.320 --> 44:59.600
As a result of their decision, Walmart and the video game industry will continue to make

44:59.600 --> 45:03.720
billions of dollars at the expense of our kids' mental health and the safety of our

45:03.720 --> 45:04.720
community.

45:04.720 --> 45:05.720
Good God.

45:05.720 --> 45:11.560
But if you read the terms, he clearly didn't read the syllabus because, and I read the

45:11.560 --> 45:18.120
whole thing, it goes in there to say that the, uh, research that they used was inherently

45:18.120 --> 45:24.320
flawed and that actually the same researchers who were trying to make the claim that violent

45:24.320 --> 45:32.880
video games were harmful to children said also television, movies, books, Saturday morning

45:32.880 --> 45:36.240
cartoons were all equally harmful.

45:36.240 --> 45:42.440
Well, on top of all that, he's saying it's in the interest of children, well, children

45:42.440 --> 45:47.960
aren't able to purchase, I mean, as it is with the company policies, they're unable

45:47.960 --> 45:54.880
to purchase these games in these stores and last time I checked, you know, children don't

45:54.880 --> 46:00.680
have $60 of, you know, they don't have a job, so someone's giving them money.

46:00.680 --> 46:05.320
Someone's obviously purchasing, someone's driving them to the stores to purchase these

46:05.320 --> 46:10.480
games, um, you know, and that person to be a parent and yeah, you know, bikes and stuff

46:10.480 --> 46:11.480
like that.

46:11.480 --> 46:17.020
But I mean, come on, it's just take some damn responsibility, let, let the responsibility

46:17.020 --> 46:18.440
lie with the parents.

46:18.440 --> 46:22.580
Well, these also, these same parents keep in mind are encouraging their kids to go play

46:22.580 --> 46:27.780
high school football and participate in sports where far more injuries occur as opposed to

46:27.780 --> 46:34.440
those related to video games and deaths, oh, don't forget deaths.

46:34.440 --> 46:40.000
So uh, by the way, Leland Yi at the end of the day basically said, uh, he's going to

46:40.000 --> 46:42.200
try again because there were a couple of people on the fence.

46:42.200 --> 46:45.000
No, of course you haven't wasted enough taxpayer money yet.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.080
I would like this, okay, so you guys lost the case, Leland Yi, um, so you're gonna pony

46:50.080 --> 46:52.720
up that $2 million that we wasted on this?

46:52.720 --> 46:54.280
You know what else is very interesting about this?

46:54.280 --> 46:58.520
You know, you hear a lot about partisan politics in this nation and this whole like, you know,

46:58.520 --> 47:01.440
Republican, Democrat stuff going on here.

47:01.440 --> 47:06.040
This really is one of those things that doesn't seem to fall on one party or the other.

47:06.040 --> 47:10.760
I mean, yes, a Democrat wrote it, but then when you look at who in the Supreme Court

47:10.760 --> 47:16.180
decided to dissent against the majority and actually side with Leland Yi, one of those

47:16.180 --> 47:21.280
justices was Clarence Thomas, who was a Herbert Walker Bush nominee to the court.

47:21.280 --> 47:24.480
The other one being Breyer, a Clinton, appointee to the court.

47:24.480 --> 47:28.280
So this, this isn't partisan either, which is interesting.

47:28.280 --> 47:32.000
I think there's so many issues in America where it's like, you know, it's a Republican

47:32.000 --> 47:35.560
issue or it's a Democrat issue, but this is one of those things that's really all over

47:35.560 --> 47:36.560
the map.

47:36.560 --> 47:37.560
Partisan politics is bullshit anyway.

47:37.560 --> 47:42.320
It's trying to add regulation for something that there's already regulation for.

47:42.320 --> 47:48.000
I suggest that they go in there and we need to enact some sort of force that'll go out

47:48.000 --> 47:50.320
there and stop people from committing laws.

47:50.320 --> 47:55.260
You know, um, it'll, it'll work above the police department because, you know, we've

47:55.260 --> 48:00.440
got the police department there, but I think we need a special military police department

48:00.440 --> 48:01.440
or something.

48:01.440 --> 48:04.600
I mean, that's almost kind of what this is like to the extreme, obviously.

48:04.600 --> 48:09.640
The other thing in the wording of the decision was that they were picking a scapegoat to

48:09.640 --> 48:14.680
treat a serious social problem that was not at the heart of the problem, that they're

48:14.680 --> 48:20.120
only picking one thing that may actually more be a symptom of the social issue.

48:20.120 --> 48:24.120
And that they, you know, they understand parents have a right to want a little bit more assistance

48:24.120 --> 48:31.760
from the government and which I think is bullshit, but, um, the whole point is that it's basically

48:31.760 --> 48:35.240
the government shall not step in on your personal liberties.

48:35.240 --> 48:38.000
We've already had enough of that going on.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.760
This is where we draw the line.

48:39.760 --> 48:45.100
And I don't understand the whole needing for education for the ESRB ratings.

48:45.100 --> 48:48.120
Does anybody need education for the movie MPAA ratings?

48:48.120 --> 48:51.960
I've never seen somebody go, oh, I don't know what an R rated movie has in it.

48:51.960 --> 48:55.600
I mean, does that ever confuse anybody?

48:55.600 --> 49:01.300
Because I see no point to this excuse anyways that, oh, as a parent, I don't understand

49:01.300 --> 49:06.320
English on the back of my box that says violence, nudity, does this game contain violence and

49:06.320 --> 49:07.320
nudity?

49:07.320 --> 49:08.320
Oh, well, it says right there that it does.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.320
I mean, so.

49:09.320 --> 49:13.360
But the issue, and I'm not even going to say this flat out as a parental issue.

49:13.360 --> 49:16.440
I'm going to say this as an essentially American issue.

49:16.440 --> 49:18.160
People are fucking lazy.

49:18.160 --> 49:19.800
Nobody wants to think for themselves.

49:19.800 --> 49:23.360
They want everything handed to them on a plate that says, here, here's everything spelled

49:23.360 --> 49:24.360
out for you.

49:24.360 --> 49:25.880
So now it's easy.

49:25.880 --> 49:27.760
We're going to take out the hard work part of it.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.200
Did you see the part?

49:29.200 --> 49:31.840
Did you see the whole thing being discussed on the Daily Show?

49:31.840 --> 49:33.840
Did you see that whole clip of Jon Stewart talking about it?

49:33.840 --> 49:37.600
I watched some of it in the moment that he said he supported Adele of the Room.

49:37.600 --> 49:41.340
Well, I didn't think, I didn't get that impression necessarily supported it.

49:41.340 --> 49:42.900
It sure seemed like it watching it.

49:42.900 --> 49:47.200
But then there was part of me that was like, it was very tongue in cheek, like, is this

49:47.200 --> 49:52.060
kind of like tongue in cheek onion style humor that maybe we're just not getting?

49:52.060 --> 49:55.680
Because what amazed me about it is as he was talking about the bill and, you know, these

49:55.680 --> 50:00.080
horrible games that would be sold, yet he was showing clips uncensored of the games

50:00.080 --> 50:05.240
on his program that I could just turn on my television and watch.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.120
So granted primetime.

50:07.120 --> 50:11.960
I was like, surely this is like just highbrow humor that I'm not getting.

50:11.960 --> 50:14.680
No, I think he was actually serious.

50:14.680 --> 50:19.460
If you knew nothing about the issue at all and you were just presented this, oh, hey,

50:19.460 --> 50:23.800
there was a law that was going to ban these violent games from going, you know, ending

50:23.800 --> 50:28.800
up in children's laps, then you could see, oh, well, you know, why did they vote against

50:28.800 --> 50:29.800
that?

50:29.800 --> 50:31.720
I mean, that doesn't make any sense why they would vote against, you know, these violent

50:31.720 --> 50:33.360
games going to kids' laps.

50:33.360 --> 50:37.560
Until you explain that, hey, there's already regulation in place, you know, done by these

50:37.560 --> 50:40.680
retailers where they're not selling this stuff to people.

50:40.680 --> 50:45.040
And there's also not this sort of regulation, you know, done by the law for any other type

50:45.040 --> 50:47.140
of media, including TV.

50:47.140 --> 50:52.800
So I mean, that's the point that he forgot to point out, because, you know, it's more

50:52.800 --> 50:58.740
interesting to have, you know, this violent imagery on screen and him going, you know,

50:58.740 --> 51:00.000
because that gets him raided.

51:00.000 --> 51:05.520
One point that Dan brought up was that now this might set a precedent for people to basically

51:05.520 --> 51:10.640
sue a company for not selling the game, like when they've sent their kid in to go buy it.

51:10.640 --> 51:11.800
And the company says no.

51:11.800 --> 51:17.040
But it is part of the business that you have the sign that says we reserve a right to refuse

51:17.040 --> 51:18.040
service to anyone.

51:18.040 --> 51:19.040
That's what I pointed out.

51:19.040 --> 51:20.440
No shirts, no shoes, no service.

51:20.440 --> 51:22.080
That's what I pointed out.

51:22.080 --> 51:25.560
And I'm like, that's not going to be an issue.

51:25.560 --> 51:28.480
And he thinks it's going to be otherwise, but I'm like, it's not going to be an issue.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.760
A business has the right to refuse service.

51:30.760 --> 51:33.400
As long as it's not, you know, discriminatory.

51:33.400 --> 51:39.400
And really, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter to me too much because I'm an adult,

51:39.400 --> 51:44.160
so it's not going to restrict the thing for me, although it's just, you know, if violent

51:44.160 --> 51:49.960
video games have this kind of stigma, then, yeah, a publisher may be more apt to censor

51:49.960 --> 51:52.720
the game a bit so that it receives a little rain.

51:52.720 --> 51:57.400
But who's to say, you know, that a teen rated game could be deemed, you know, violent enough

51:57.400 --> 51:58.400
to fall under this?

51:58.400 --> 51:59.400
That's the problem with it.

51:59.400 --> 52:03.440
Going to our chat room at chat.org.com, Salacious Pop is actually commenting in our chat room

52:03.440 --> 52:06.440
right now and saying, Loki, there's actually two movies where that happened.

52:06.440 --> 52:08.280
I think talking about some of the violence.

52:08.280 --> 52:12.440
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which was PG, made parents flip their shit.

52:12.440 --> 52:14.680
It's why PG-13 was invented.

52:14.680 --> 52:15.680
That's right.

52:15.680 --> 52:18.400
I saw faces melting when I was a kid and I turned out okay.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.960
Remember that scene?

52:19.960 --> 52:20.960
Yeah.

52:20.960 --> 52:23.880
And it's so fake now, but when you were a kid, you like close your eyes.

52:23.880 --> 52:25.160
No, I'll tell you, you know what?

52:25.160 --> 52:26.160
I will tell you what?

52:26.160 --> 52:27.160
I saw Gremlins.

52:27.160 --> 52:30.840
I'm going to tell you what movie scene scared the fucking shit out of me when I was a kid.

52:30.840 --> 52:33.360
And you look back on it now and you're like, that is so dopey.

52:33.360 --> 52:36.620
But I'll tell you what, anybody in chat who's in their lower thirties is going to know exactly

52:36.620 --> 52:39.200
what their high twenties is going to know exactly what I'm talking about.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.200
Okay.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.200
Ready?

52:41.200 --> 52:42.200
It was in Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

52:42.200 --> 52:43.200
Oh my God.

52:43.200 --> 52:44.200
Yeah.

52:44.200 --> 52:49.680
When he gets in the truck with large Marge and she does this, she's telling the story

52:49.680 --> 52:53.600
on a night just like this, right?

52:53.600 --> 52:59.680
And then she goes, and it looked like this whole like claymation thing, right?

52:59.680 --> 53:05.680
Like little kids bursting into tears across the country, scarred for life will never like,

53:05.680 --> 53:07.840
I still can't watch that scene.

53:07.840 --> 53:10.360
It's why we are afraid of truckers.

53:10.360 --> 53:11.960
Our generation is afraid of truckers.

53:11.960 --> 53:13.600
My daddy was a trucker.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.480
Then we're afraid of your daddy.

53:16.480 --> 53:17.480
Actually my dad is still a trucker.

53:17.480 --> 53:19.760
And it's all large Marge's fault.

53:19.760 --> 53:20.760
But you know what?

53:20.760 --> 53:21.760
That was a PG movie.

53:21.760 --> 53:25.400
One of my, no, that scene actually, I still can't watch it.

53:25.400 --> 53:30.480
And I actually had a friend had that as their Facebook picture and I messaged them and asked

53:30.480 --> 53:34.600
them very nicely if they would remove it because that was a very traumatic scene.

53:34.600 --> 53:37.200
Do not find the damn picture, Rob.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.200
Oh my God.

53:38.200 --> 53:39.200
No, no, no.

53:39.200 --> 53:40.200
I'm not finding the picture.

53:40.200 --> 53:41.440
I just want to make sure the movie was rated PG.

53:41.440 --> 53:42.440
Where was it?

53:42.440 --> 53:43.440
I think it was.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.000
I just, I, cause I'd be on the art world.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Check IMDB.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.480
See, look, I can't figure out what this freaking movie is rated.

53:49.480 --> 53:50.480
Like should it be this?

53:50.480 --> 53:51.480
Rob, IMDB.

53:51.480 --> 53:52.480
IMDB.

53:52.480 --> 53:56.760
But you know, actually there was one movie that I saw when I was a kid and it was rated

53:56.760 --> 53:59.460
our movie and I went to see it with my uncle.

53:59.460 --> 54:03.160
I've seen tons of rated our movies when I was a little kid.

54:03.160 --> 54:04.220
It's PG.

54:04.220 --> 54:05.220
Thank you.

54:05.220 --> 54:06.220
IMDB.

54:06.220 --> 54:09.380
And this is the only movie rated R that ever scared me.

54:09.380 --> 54:11.760
And now today you will laugh at this.

54:11.760 --> 54:12.760
What?

54:12.760 --> 54:13.760
It was poultry guys three.

54:13.760 --> 54:14.760
Oh wow.

54:14.760 --> 54:17.440
And then I was afraid of mirrors for like a week.

54:17.440 --> 54:19.440
Have you seen it?

54:19.440 --> 54:22.240
I was afraid of mirrors for like a week and then I thought that I would die.

54:22.240 --> 54:25.520
Like like what's like Heather O'Rourke.

54:25.520 --> 54:28.000
And then after a week I was like, Oh yeah, it's stupid.

54:28.000 --> 54:33.520
I would love to see as a challenge to filmmakers out there to see what kind of, how fucked

54:33.520 --> 54:38.240
up of a movie they could make and have it still be rated G because that would be awesome.

54:38.240 --> 54:41.200
Well, look at any Disney movie.

54:41.200 --> 54:45.880
I mean, okay, Tarzan, we've all seen that Disney movie, right?

54:45.880 --> 54:46.880
Yeah.

54:46.880 --> 54:47.880
Spoiler alert.

54:47.880 --> 54:54.960
The main villain dies in the movie by being strangled to death by falling down with vines

54:54.960 --> 55:00.760
wrapped around his neck with his neck broken and they show the silhouette of it.

55:00.760 --> 55:03.620
I was like, this is very violent for kids.

55:03.620 --> 55:05.380
Or how about Snow White?

55:05.380 --> 55:09.120
Almost all Disney villains die by falling off a cliff and then it's, you just see that

55:09.120 --> 55:10.920
little poof of smoke.

55:10.920 --> 55:19.260
Or how about Snow White movie from, what was it, 1947 wasn't it?

55:19.260 --> 55:24.020
The queen is the old witch trying to push the boulder down the hill and instead lightning

55:24.020 --> 55:25.020
strikes her.

55:25.020 --> 55:28.360
She falls off the cliff and the boulder lands on her.

55:28.360 --> 55:31.680
Okay, right.

55:31.680 --> 55:35.120
Lots of people in chat talking about the large Marge scene and how actually there were a

55:35.120 --> 55:37.240
lot of people that apparently were scared by that.

55:37.240 --> 55:40.360
Dungeon Buster mentions the death of Optimus Prime.

55:40.360 --> 55:41.600
Let's see.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.160
I hope I'm saying this right.

55:43.160 --> 55:48.600
Rade, or maybe that's Raid, Rade says, oh Jesus, large Marge, that scarred me for life.

55:48.600 --> 55:51.100
Break Man says, yeah, that was scary because it was so unexpected.

55:51.100 --> 55:54.420
And Frisbee says, I still can't watch that.

55:54.420 --> 55:55.540
So you're not alone.

55:55.540 --> 55:59.000
And of course, SSJ100 Matt provides a YouTube link if you want to see that.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.920
Zethur, another one here, the boat scene in Willy Wonka scared me shitless.

56:02.920 --> 56:05.520
Dude, that movie was fucked up.

56:05.520 --> 56:06.520
It was.

56:06.520 --> 56:08.480
Like, I don't like the new one.

56:08.480 --> 56:09.840
The old one is far more fucked up.

56:09.840 --> 56:13.960
I appreciate them both, but the old one, I was actually a child when I saw the old one

56:13.960 --> 56:15.480
and it was kind of fucked up.

56:15.480 --> 56:16.480
I was a little afraid.

56:16.480 --> 56:21.200
When she's a bad egg and she falls through the chute and all these, I want the world,

56:21.200 --> 56:23.040
I want the whole world.

56:23.040 --> 56:26.960
There is no way of knowing where exactly we are going.

56:26.960 --> 56:32.640
I was afraid of Gene Wilder when I was little for a while, for a while.

56:32.640 --> 56:33.640
Our whole generation.

56:33.640 --> 56:34.640
I mean, where do you think?

56:34.640 --> 56:36.760
Why are we not more screwed up?

56:36.760 --> 56:38.920
And yet we all turned out fine.

56:38.920 --> 56:40.240
Yeah, we turned out fine.

56:40.240 --> 56:46.160
I'm not saying that kids should be subjected to this violence, but I think that's a parent's

56:46.160 --> 56:47.160
addiction to make.

56:47.160 --> 56:49.840
I saw Star Trek 5 in the theater and I'm not fucked up and that was awful.

56:49.840 --> 56:54.160
I think any parent that's saying, I didn't know what this game was rated or I didn't

56:54.160 --> 56:58.640
know that this game had violence in it or I didn't know this is just retarded.

56:58.640 --> 57:02.240
And if you're like, I didn't know how to read the rating system, you're an idiot.

57:02.240 --> 57:05.300
Can you tell us what our old Saturday morning cartoons were like?

57:05.300 --> 57:09.600
You know, I realize I don't have kids, so maybe some people are not going to value my

57:09.600 --> 57:13.260
opinion, but whatever, F you, it's my show.

57:13.260 --> 57:18.640
If I had kids, I would want them to see that violence the first time because they're gonna

57:18.640 --> 57:19.640
see it.

57:19.640 --> 57:20.840
They're going to see it at a friend's house.

57:20.840 --> 57:22.740
They're going to see it at some point.

57:22.740 --> 57:24.020
You're going to see it on CNN.

57:24.020 --> 57:26.480
They're going to see it when they're flipping through the TV and they'll see it on Comedy

57:26.480 --> 57:27.480
Central.

57:27.480 --> 57:28.480
Okay.

57:28.480 --> 57:32.080
I would rather they see it with me present so we can talk about it.

57:32.080 --> 57:33.080
Yeah.

57:33.080 --> 57:36.720
It's just like sexual things, although that's a very uncomfortable subject for a lot of

57:36.720 --> 57:37.720
parents.

57:37.720 --> 57:41.280
I don't want my kids to find out from other places.

57:41.280 --> 57:44.840
And I don't understand the double standard between sexual stuff and violent stuff.

57:44.840 --> 57:45.840
You have a kid.

57:45.840 --> 57:46.840
Tell me I'm right.

57:46.840 --> 57:48.280
So it validates my opinion.

57:48.280 --> 57:54.660
Well, regardless of the ESRB rating, I'm just going to pick games that I think are suitable

57:54.660 --> 57:56.080
for my child.

57:56.080 --> 58:01.320
And that may be different than like, honestly, if you teach them well enough, they know what

58:01.320 --> 58:02.320
fiction is.

58:02.320 --> 58:07.440
I mean, the people that I'm killing in Grand Theft Auto aren't real people.

58:07.440 --> 58:11.560
And obviously you don't want to go emulate that on street by going and killing real people,

58:11.560 --> 58:17.600
but they're just AI computer controlled people.

58:17.600 --> 58:19.640
You can brutally murder them and nothing happens.

58:19.640 --> 58:24.360
But my point was going back though to Saturday Morning Cartoons, how many of us grew up with,

58:24.360 --> 58:26.160
you know, Pixie and Dixie, Mr. Jinx?

58:26.160 --> 58:27.680
Or how about fucking Tom and Jerry?

58:27.680 --> 58:28.680
Tom and Jerry.

58:28.680 --> 58:29.680
That shit was vulgar.

58:29.680 --> 58:30.680
Like, it was very violent.

58:30.680 --> 58:37.340
Well, on top of that, keep in mind that these were, and they banned, and they came actually

58:37.340 --> 58:39.120
right from vaudeville humor too.

58:39.120 --> 58:44.040
But keep in mind, keep in mind, not only did we have, you know, them beating up on each

58:44.040 --> 58:50.480
other, but if you look at when a lot of these cartoons were made, when certain racial stereotyping

58:50.480 --> 58:54.320
was considered to be standard humor.

58:54.320 --> 58:58.660
You know, I grew up watching Tom and Jerry with, you know, Tom and Blackface.

58:58.660 --> 59:02.560
We watched Tom and Jerry cartoons in church.

59:02.560 --> 59:04.640
I went to a Baptist church when I was younger.

59:04.640 --> 59:06.440
Let's, we'll save that discussion for another day.

59:06.440 --> 59:07.760
I was raised in one.

59:07.760 --> 59:08.760
Yeah.

59:08.760 --> 59:11.560
I remember there was a lock in, quote unquote, of the church once and we watched Tom and

59:11.560 --> 59:12.840
Jerry cartoons all night.

59:12.840 --> 59:16.480
So we watched Song of the South.

59:16.480 --> 59:17.480
Oh God.

59:17.480 --> 59:23.480
All right, look, I want to move on to other topics, but I, uh, but the point, the point

59:23.480 --> 59:25.440
is that parents need to do their job.

59:25.440 --> 59:28.600
It's better that you were there with them to explain it than leave them unexposed.

59:28.600 --> 59:33.200
You know, I did actually know somebody who was pretty much blocked from everything when

59:33.200 --> 59:36.960
she was growing up and now I didn't know her while she was growing up.

59:36.960 --> 59:42.240
My friends knew her, but from what I understand, she was a lot more messed up than anyone I

59:42.240 --> 59:44.960
known who grew up exposed to everything.

59:44.960 --> 59:47.920
Let me quickly get some comments from chat room, chat dot orange on show.com.

59:47.920 --> 59:51.560
Break man says, if I ever have kids, I refuse to use cutesy names for things.

59:51.560 --> 59:56.660
I want my kids to know that they have a penis or vagina, not a wee wee or a who, um, bonds

59:56.660 --> 59:58.000
double six as I agree.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.680
My mom had us watch a lot of adult shows and movies and personally I don't think it messed

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.680
me up.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.320
Uh, and then dungeon Buster says, I love the Penn and Teller bullshit show where they looked

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.960
at violent video games.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.960
That was good.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.000
Actually, I'll have to find you the clip.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.640
They get a 13 year old with his mother's permission, put a gun in his hand and they have a trainer

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.640
there.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.640
You know, it's supervised.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.640
There's a police officer there.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.160
They give him an automatic weapon and say, okay, go ahead and shoot it once.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.400
This is how you do it.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.240
Shows him the proper everything.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.240
Oh God.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:31.720
The kid shoots the gun, steps back and says, wow, and the guy goes, do you want to do it

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720
again?

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.020
He says, no, I don't want to touch this thing again.

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:38.760
And then they showed him later on that he was in tears, 13 years old, but he played,

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:46.400
but he goes home and plays so calm and all these violent games yet, you know, is, is

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:51.800
this the, you know, reaction that those people who are putting out that propaganda want us,

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.920
you know, to think is going to happen?

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.320
I don't know if I would go to that extreme to teach my child, but then again, I have

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.280
an issue with guns, but we'll save that for another episode of the show.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.560
But you get the point that you're saying, no, I do.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.560
I do.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:09.400
So the point was, do these games train kids to be killers and clearly not, first of all,

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:13.680
he didn't even hit the target or like he hit like way off.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:17.360
And second of all, he didn't even want to touch it again.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.360
Now me, I want as many guns as possible, but I would rather have a real gun than play a

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.360
gun game.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:23.360
Oh God.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.360
Here's another one.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.360
This was on television.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.360
You ready for this one?

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.160
This is some scary fucking shit from when you were a kid.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:34.120
SGA 100 Matt says, just show your kids Tim Curry as it and they will crap themselves.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.720
Actually his name was Pennywise the clown, but yes, same thing.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.720
Right?

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.720
Remember that?

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.720
That shit was fucking scary.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.720
That was.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.720
And that was on TV.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.720
That was an ABC.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.720
Or how many of us watched legend?

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.360
There's actually a scene in that I can't watch ever.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.280
Anyway, we got to get past the kid scary stuff.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.120
I want to address from chat real quick.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.120
Somebody had asked, what has Leland Yee done besides the bill?

01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.460
So I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, just thumbing through some of the other things

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:01.460
he's done.

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:07.720
Uh, AB 1371 in 2003 strengthens informed consent requirements for mentally handicapped patients

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.640
that take part in medical research.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:17.440
Uh, 2004 AB 2412 allows part-time community college faculty to access unemployment benefits.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.160
AB 3042 enhances sentences for child prostitution.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:28.600
Uh, let's see, 2006 AB 409 establishes tighter controls and higher health standards for nail

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.600
salons.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:35.520
Uh, AB 1207 adds sexual orientation to the list of protections in the code of fair political

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520
practices.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.640
So, you know, he's not been all about, you know, take it or leave it with you.

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.080
I don't know what there you agree with or what you don't agree with.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.320
There's been other stuff to him than just this violent video game law, which I think

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:52.000
unfortunately he's making a, uh, a whole career defining thing out of.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.080
Just a heads up, he is running for mayor of San Francisco.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.080
You may or may not know.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.840
Uh, San Francisco, the former mayor Gavin Newsom, uh, is now the Lieutenant Governor

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:03.000
of California after the November elections.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.440
Uh, so they have an interim mayor and that means there's going to be a new mayor election

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.440
this year.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.920
So there are a handful of candidates in the ring and Leland Yee is one of them.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.240
So there you go.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.400
Unfortunately, maybe violent video games will be banned in San Francisco.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.400
Why not?

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.200
They're banning Happy Meal toys and circumcision too on top of everything else.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.200
So why not?

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.480
We'll just throw violent video games in there.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.480
Anyhow.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:32.160
Oh yeah, I guess I should get one other story here that I meant to mention.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.880
Uh, Utah, uh, Utah was going to be doing a similar type of thing.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.920
However, the rep, uh, Michael Morley that was trying to get the law passed in Utah said,

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:48.040
uh, after the Supreme Court decision, quote, it's not on my radar to fight that fight.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:52.160
So I guess after the Supreme Court decision, he's decided there are better things to do.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.700
All right, let's move on.

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:54.700
More news.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.700
Dark Sakura.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:00.180
I was still trying to find this one article that was talking about the greatest cartoons

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.640
for traumatizing children.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.800
Um, but how about we talk about Zinga?

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.760
Zinga has something that's pretty traumatic for children.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.760
Yes, it is.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.120
It has something very new.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.840
And I am actually going to quote this article because I like the way it's laid out.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.960
It's a new venture.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.840
It's something different from Farmville and Frontierville.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.440
So here's where the quote begins.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.240
One, it doesn't actually have Ville in the title.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.760
Two, players play with actual totally real money.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:30.720
Three, players companies won't necessarily grow.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.080
In fact, it may shrink through no fault of their own.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.080
Wait, wait.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.000
Players play with real money?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Mm-hmm.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.880
The company is Zinga and it's not a game but a stock offering.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.880
They're going public.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.480
Oh, I get it.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.040
They're going public.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:52.560
They are filling an S1 form and it's not going to be publicly traded.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.560
So you know what this means?

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.560
We can really fuck them now.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:01.560
No, I think their stock's actually, they're expecting their stock to jump up in price

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.400
quite a bit, so it might not be a bad buy.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:09.520
So, I mean, Zinga really, really relies on Facebook for a lot of their business.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520
A lot.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.960
Like I know they're going to come out and say they don't need Facebook to survive, but

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:13.960
they kind of do.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.680
Like Facebook put them on the map.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.440
Now with all this talk about the decline of people using Facebook, Google Plus is coming

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.800
out and has people talking.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.360
I mean, you know, don't put it in the nail coffin of Facebook yet.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.200
Assuming that they let people in.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:31.320
But I'm just saying, you know, there is this talk about Facebook might be slipping a little

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.320
bit.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.600
Like it's time for Zinga to say, trust in us.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:41.000
Like I really think I personally, I just kind of think Zinga needs to find a niche that

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.940
isn't just Facebook games or isn't just a VIL game.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:48.120
Like I know you were kind of joking with the whole story about the stock market, but like

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.640
it would be great for Zinga's profile if they could do a game that's not VIL.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.720
Now I'm sure somebody is going to bring up and okay, find the words.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.720
Farm villain.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.720
No, no.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.720
The words with friends.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.120
There actually is a Facebook game called Farm Villain and it's about like posting status

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.080
updates to your wall that are fucked up shit.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:09.240
But anyway, there's the words with friends free and the, uh, hanging with friends on

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.920
that they got from buying other developers basically, but you know, Zinga doesn't kind

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:19.080
of yet have that thing that they're known for besides Facebook games.

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.320
You know what I mean?

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:27.340
So that and a very neutered dog on their logo.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.880
Where does that, doesn't that name have like a weird meaning to it too?

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:34.640
I can't remember like where the company name came from or something silly.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.100
Islander says, I didn't know Zinga was on Facebook.

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.320
I've just been playing on MySpace.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:43.080
Ladies and gentlemen, we have found the one person that is still on MySpace.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.240
I thought it was Tom.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.400
I thought it was Justin Timberlake, but go to chat right now.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.400
He's there.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.400
Zinga is the CEO's dog.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.320
Oh, that's why the logo is a dog.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.320
That makes sense.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.320
All right.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.320
Uh, let's see.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:59.200
By the way, we got a tweet about this tonight from a Twitter user, Nathan Jackson.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.440
I would like you all to talk about Zinga going public.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:05.280
Do you all think it would be sustainable with games like Farmville going down?

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.880
Uh, kind of that same point I was just making like things are declining.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:14.920
So I think the only way Zinga can be successful is for them to show what else they have that

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.040
isn't just Farmville and Facebook games.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.120
And I think this whole word with friends and stuff is a good place to start, but they have

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:25.880
to be able to show that they can consistently be on top of these social or casual gaming

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.880
trends if you will.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.840
I just hope to God it's not true that they tried to buy PopCap.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.260
That would be, that would make me very sad if Zinga and PopCap merged.

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.260
Very sad.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:43.240
All right, moving on, let's get to some other news stories and release dates soon.

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.640
Some more depressing news.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:53.020
If you thought, you know, the government trying to fine you for purchasing an adult game if

01:07:53.020 --> 01:08:01.120
you're under the age was bad, well, Senate Bill S978 is gonna really get you going.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:07.540
It's gonna basically regulate a lot of stuff that's going on the internet, mainly streaming

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:12.880
unauthorized copyrighted material, making it a felony that will result in up to five

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.660
years of jail time if it's passed.

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:20.920
Basically it says, the bill states that 10 or more public performances by electronic

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:28.200
means during any 180 day period of one or more copyrighted works will result in not

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.960
more than five years of imprisonment.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:37.760
So as long as the performance in question is valued at least $2500 US, or the value

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:44.160
of the license to legally perform its content is valued at $5000 or more.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:49.120
And basically it's the same criteria that they allow right now for the DMCA takedown

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.720
notices to be issued by copyright holders.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:57.160
However, jail time and felony status are not currently associated obviously with those,

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:04.720
and now they're saying right now it says if it manages to pass.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.640
The homemade gameplay clips, which I've never heard of them called like this, but apparently

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:17.980
referred to as let's play videos, fan made music videos, a webcam, cover songs, anything

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:20.560
I guess that involves music or video.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:27.240
It could potentially cover cell phone videos of concerts and press events.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:35.420
So yeah, basically if they're saying that this could apply to YouTube users, and also

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:43.360
sites that embed YouTube content as well, and really to get down to the bottom, I think

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.680
they're gonna have a hard time regulating this stuff.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:52.240
I mean, if they're gonna go after everything, then, I don't know, and this is only gonna

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.440
benefit what?

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.400
I understand that you, for example, if you take a song off an album and you put it as

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.840
a YouTube video and you leave it there so people can listen or pirate that song, I understand

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840
that's bad.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:12.320
If for example, and I don't even know about so much the music videos and stuff, I don't

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.760
have a real big problem with that, especially gameplay videos, I don't understand gameplay

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:25.540
at all because it's not really the same as like putting a movie up, like an actual cinematic

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:30.320
movie and you're pirating or like a TV show or something like that.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:35.600
This law is absolute total utter bullshit, and the problem with it is that it's just

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.160
shittily written.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.440
Is that a word I can use, shittily?

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.440
It can be.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:48.840
Anyway, this law was shite, it is total utter shite, and the reason why it's shite, it's

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.200
just badly written because it includes all this other stuff.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.000
I get what they're trying to do.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.800
What they're trying to do is they're trying to get at these websites where you can log

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:02.940
in and you can stream movies that are in the theater, you can stream them, or current TV

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.040
shows and all that.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:08.200
That's what they're doing, but because they've left the door so wide fucking open, if somebody

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:12.780
gets on there and tapes a karaoke performance and puts it up on YouTube, it could be subject

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.080
to this law.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.400
And you might be saying, well that's not what they're trying to go after, but unfortunately

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:22.560
when you have a shittily written law, excuse me, a shite law like this, it leaves the door

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.560
open for that.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.280
I mean, if you're saying that if this isn't what they're going to try to do with it, well

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:32.520
yeah, sure, I'm sure that that one person downloading that one MP3 really costs that

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:36.880
music company $100,000 for that one song.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.640
The problem is this is also, it's just taking a big fat dump all over fair use.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.640
Like I should be, yes, I should be able to upload video for the purpose of critiquing

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.280
and commenting on it.

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:52.320
So you mean I'm going to have to contact the copyright owner to get express permission

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320
to do that?

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320
Well guess what?

01:11:54.320 --> 01:12:00.080
All of your game review videos are going to be done by IGN, 1UP, GameSpot, and all the

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.200
big companies because Activision all those times, they don't have the time for little

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.920
pissants like you and me that they're going to sign off on the rights for that.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.520
So say goodbye to independent media if something like this passes.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.520
You know what?

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.200
Say goodbye to Orange Lounge Radio if this passes because I'm telling you, if this bill

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.480
in its current form passes and goes effective, I'm walking away from the show because I am

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:27.640
not going to go to jail because I like to play music over the classic game of the week

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.720
for the purposes of critiquing it.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.720
That is not a threat.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.720
That is a promise.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:35.560
If the law passes and is enforced, there will not be Orange Lounge Radio anymore.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.560
Period.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.560
Well, I don't know.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.920
Maybe Loki and Dark Soccer will decide they want to do it, but somehow I don't think they

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.440
want to subject themselves to that either.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.520
Like that is the seriousness of this bullshit law.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.320
I get what they're trying to do.

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:50.640
They're not doing it right.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.760
So they need to, you need to contact your senator, contact folks and tell them that

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.200
this law is a bad thing for America.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.000
Now just to let you know, there actually is a site up there that will generate email to

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.660
your local legislature.

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.520
So you do have a way of getting out there.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.560
Actually I have relinked it on my live, not my live channel, but my Facebook.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.080
And who is voting these goddamn people in the office?

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.120
I mean, seriously, all these Lin Yee's and shit.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.880
Oh, and he's going to become mayor now because he's such full of wonderful ideas.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:25.880
That's great.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:29.680
Remember what I said about lazy Americans?

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:37.280
The fact that people won't get up and vote when these things come up, just sit back and

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280
bitch about it.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.280
Sorry, you don't vote about it.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.280
You have no right to complain.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:44.440
Uh, Tiger Claw in our chat room says, yesterday I was on Justin TV and I did a search of Transformers

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.200
and sure enough people were streaming a bootleg of Transformers 3 in a foreign language.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.200
Hahaha.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:54.660
Well then they, that needs to be worked out between Justin TV and the copyright owners

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:56.080
of the work.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:00.400
And Justin TV should take action there thusly against those accounts of people doing it

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.200
because I'm sure that is against their terms of service.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.600
Like that's the law you need.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:10.880
Not sending me to jail because I want to sing, uh, or I wouldn't, I want to post a tape of

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.160
Jessica and I singing Love Shack on the internet.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.880
Actually I would never post that tape on the internet, but she did and I don't want her

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:16.960
to go to jail for that.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:23.920
And, and, and on top of that, that would make certain games illegal because I believe like

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:30.160
SingStar and stuff like that allows you to take songs and record videos to them and post

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160
them up on the internet.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.160
Correct.

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.660
And also there's going to be a game like SingFour, um, the hits edition that's going to have

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.440
connectivity with YouTube as well.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:43.240
So all those are basically felony makers.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:48.400
Unless of course those people that own those songs or, you know, own those video game companies

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.960
and stuff like that.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:55.400
Don't stop these things from going, cause if no one complains, then you know, it's going

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.400
to be all right.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.320
Black Wolf in our chat room says, well, to be fair, I don't know if the guy who wrote

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:03.080
this bill campaigned on this, so they could have voted him in without knowing he was going

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.840
to pen this specific bill.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.280
And that's a, that's a true point.

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.280
You never know what politicians are going to do, but we need to hold them accountable.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:14.960
And I plan to write my Congress people and say, if you support this bill, I will not

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.240
vote for you.

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.640
I will not vote for you.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.920
What's it take to like, say for example, um, get these guys out of office, you know, there's

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.160
these elections that they have every few years.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:30.040
Well, I understand that, but I'm, I, you know, Hey, we can recall, I guess that's what happened

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:35.760
with governor or how governor Schwarzenegger got into office in the first place.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.600
So I can't remember the govern ater, that's where that all came from.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:44.000
He terminated the other governor and where that shit, you know, I think we ended up with

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.620
the worst governor, but I don't want to make this show political.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.640
So anyhow, I'm too late for that.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.640
I know, right?

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.560
Like I really didn't want, especially after last week where things got a little heated,

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.840
like I really didn't want to have a political show tonight, but like we can't fucking get

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:58.840
away from it.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:05.500
It's all that's in the news this week is all this political stuff.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.280
Let's move to another country.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.400
Let's make our own country.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400
It's O.L.A.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:17.800
Uh, by the way, the Senator that's behind this is, uh, Amy Klobuchar, Klobuchar, Democrat

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.480
from Minnesota and Minnesota.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.400
There's a whole website, open congress.org that will show you who's in favor of it and

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.400
who's against it.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.720
Right now, 51 companies for it, three against.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.320
I'm telling you though, if it goes through, it's going to be yet another one of those

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.520
laws that gets tied up because I, I would be fucking pissed cause this is just seems

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.840
to violate fair use.

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.400
Like really, I can't film somebody at karaoke?

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.400
Like that is wrong.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.200
Well, and how, how more ridiculous is this going to go?

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.680
I mean, on the bright side, American Idol will finally go off the air.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:52.400
It's like, um, say for example, you know, the happy birthday song.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.400
Is that public domain?

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:57.800
I mean, is, are people going to get sued because there's a song playing in the background of

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.440
like a YouTube video or something like that?

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:09.640
Quoting videos, well, you know, Leland, you at least one quote, you know, he's talking

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:13.480
about different, you know, stuff, you know, pandering towards corporations.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:17.160
I think this is one of those things that panders towards a corporation, not necessarily the

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.960
one that you're quoting.

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:23.080
Um, when he made that comment, but there are definitely a lot of bills and stuff that go

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.840
towards these corporations that have these senators in their pockets.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.320
So I don't know.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.960
It's not, not much of a surprise.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.680
Just so you guys know, here's some of the organizations that are supporting this bill.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.720
The Directors Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild, the Motion Picture Association

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.840
of America, Recording Industry Association of America, NBCUniversal, Viacom, Sony Pictures

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:51.320
Entertainment, Ultimate Fighting Championship, uh, Church Music Publishers Association.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.760
Well, we're fucked.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.280
Church Music Publishers Association.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:59.000
It's all the RAA and MPAA and all the different movies to use because no one wants piracy.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.720
But you know what, that I understand, hey, no, I have no problem with them fighting piracy.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:11.200
I get the, yeah, the, the, the reason this bill is going into place, I get it.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.640
This bill doesn't cut it.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.880
You need to close these loopholes in the bill before it, and basically what is going to

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:25.000
stop every website in Canada and other countries like I, this is another reason, oh, I promised

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.560
I wouldn't get political, but I can't.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.120
This is another reason I can't keep supporting these bills that try to regulate the internet

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.440
in America.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.400
You idiots, America does not rule the world, contrary to what everybody seems to think

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.040
sometimes here.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.040
You can't stop the rest of the world.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.480
Hey, well, at least we can still stream in Canada.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:46.000
It will all go to China.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.440
Look at the story we started off with tonight.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.160
Where did the rampant piracy come from?

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.800
Where did Ask Cree Bro come from?

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.120
China.

01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:01.440
So all the fine Orange Lawn's radio is moving to China.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:06.080
If this bill goes through, at least we can do our show from there.

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.680
I'd rather live in Taiwan.

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.000
We can still stream it, you know, stream to Canada and I can play all the Assassin's Creed

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
brotherhood.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.160
We don't have to say where we're located.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.160
We're in Canadian and not in the U S I'm not Benji in our chat room says actually happy

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.500
birthday is copyrighted.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.500
That's right.

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:27.120
So if you put up a YouTube singing happy birthday to someone, you're going to be, your ass is

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.400
going to jail for, I would love to see that article.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:34.140
Grandma goes is, you know, okay.

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:38.080
What happens if you know, you make do three different songs, we'd be singing like happy

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:43.560
birthday and then a couple of other karaoke songs and that's three strikes or three, no,

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:44.560
that's not three strikes.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:51.000
It's major like a violent felonies I think, but DJ Morpheus in the chat room, our good

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.720
buddy from under sedation live Saturday nights here at all games, but not to worry.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.200
This is going through Congress.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.800
So the public will have a voice and courts to fight it.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.960
Unlike carp, which was all secretly done behind closed doors.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:09.000
Well, God damn sir, I hope you are right because three words, this bill sucks.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Fucking sucks.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Four words.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
All right.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.560
And this is really more important than, you know, balancing a budget.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:21.220
Dark Ted Sousa says, well, we're still waiting to see if under station live will be banned

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:22.220
in China.

01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:25.020
It'll, it'll be a great little thing for the network.

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:29.000
It'll be like the show from China versus the show that can't be in China.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
All on one network.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.560
He said all games.com will also have to move to China or Canada.

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:38.040
Where can all games.com go if this bill passes all games.com?

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.440
What country would we put them in?

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:40.920
Where would Scott Rubin want to be?

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:50.320
They can go to, uh, where would Scott Amsterdam, no, no, there's no football there.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.960
Oh shit.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:21:01.280
Football, but not, well then I guess they could do Canadian football in Canada.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.280
All right.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.160
Moving on.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:07.640
This bill is, uh, it's taking far too much time on our show, but at the same time it

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.800
is very important.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:11.120
And so, uh, we just want to bring your attention to it.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:17.180
Like I'm not fucking around if this bill passes, say goodbye to a lot of your favorite gaming

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.180
press stuff.

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:21.120
This, this is bad for the gaming industry.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.080
This is bad for the gaming industry.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.680
And if they don't see it, they're morons.

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.800
It's impotent.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:32.880
Speaking of morons, Nintendo of America updated their Facebook page on Sunday, promising that

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:36.440
they would give more updates soon regarding some of the petitions that have been going

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.440
around.

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:38.440
We talked about this last week on the show.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:42.520
I think dark soccer brought up how fans were petitioning for releases of Xenoblade, the

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:48.480
last story in Pandora's tower here in the U S uh, it was called operation rainfall.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:52.920
Well on, uh, let's see Tuesday, I think was the day it was finally posted.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.880
They finally posted a response.

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:57.400
Fans have been waiting for this quote.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:02.100
We never say never, but we can confirm that there are no plans to bring these three games

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.960
to the Americas at this time.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:10.200
The Twitter response thanked operation rainfall folks for being such incredible fans, but

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:15.000
said there continues to be no plans for Nintendo of America to release these three games right

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
now.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.520
So I see, I haven't seen people rally for a Wii games release in a very long time, not

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:26.440
since president cat have fans rallied for a Wii game to be released, which by the way,

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:31.520
I don't know if you guys saw this, but a destructor had an article this week because of all this

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:35.320
about the 10 great Wii games that should have been released that folks are campaigning for

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:38.680
that never were president cat made the list.

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:43.140
So our little campaign was not forgotten, which I think is great.

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:47.400
And they actually said the game is called president cat people, which made me laugh

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.360
because the game actually wasn't called president cat.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.200
We kind of gave it that name because the translation was like boss cat.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.960
And so I don't know, it just kind of came out, let's call it president cat.

01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:03.440
Well, the, the definition of a Sukeban is like a delinquent gang leader girl.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:08.640
So if you imagine a cat being like a delinquent gang leader who was also the president of

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:12.120
the company, yes, then that's what it's like.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.920
Gang banger cat.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.360
That can be the sequel.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.560
All right.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.840
Um, geez.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:27.600
Anyhow by the way, Xenoblade is still getting a localization for an English speaking country

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:34.580
and then some, uh, there is a European localization in the works and uh, this is for Xenoblade

01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:38.120
Chronicles and it was in an Iwata Asks interview.

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.120
That's a little video clip there.

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:43.080
And uh, Xenoblade is coming out in Europe on September 2nd.

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:47.800
It's going to come out with a red classic controller pro in order to, to localize a

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.800
game for Europe.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:54.280
I think it's gotta be an English, French, Spanish, German, and I'm forgetting a language,

01:23:54.280 --> 01:24:00.920
but like there's like five languages, Swahili, probably English, French, Spanish, probably

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:01.920
Italian.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.600
That's like five different languages.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:08.380
The game's got to be in to come out over there and uh, she just do it in Latin yet.

01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:11.260
It's not worth the money to put out here.

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:16.280
It would take no money, I mean, no additional money to bring it over here, seeing as they're

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.280
already doing the translation.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.640
Well at least I could go on eBay and get a bootleg of it from China, at least you'll

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.640
get that.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:22.640
At least.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:27.360
I'm of course, you know, their comment on Twitter was, you know, that in fact, Operation

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:32.320
Rainfall, someone retweeted that and they made the comment of, they basically retweeted

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:37.440
what Nintendo said, to which I put dot dot dot, instead we have some more Nintendo 64

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.720
games we'd like to port over and make zero changes and Zelda you had a premium.

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.280
Love Nintendo.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:49.840
Exactly, Zelda, Zelda Ocarina of Time in 3D, not a problem, Xenoblade, fuck you.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:50.840
That's what I'm hearing.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.800
But hey, you know what though?

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.600
Nintendo's gonna be, you don't understand, here's how Nintendo's gonna fucking play this

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.600
shit off.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:03.120
Well we have no plans on doing that right now, but come E3, fans demanded it, and Nintendo,

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:07.360
we hear you fans, we're gonna bring it out for you because we're so gracious, we're gonna

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.000
bring them out to you.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.360
It's basically, you're gonna beg for it, and then they're gonna say no, and they're like,

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.800
ah, well we're so gracious, we're gonna bring it out to you.

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.800
So you know what?

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.480
When they do that, don't fucking buy it.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.480
Tell them, fuck you.

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.640
Wait, but why wouldn't you?

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.720
If they finally do decide to release the game, isn't that what you wanted?

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.360
Because it's the attitude that they're having with it?

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:31.480
I don't know if I meet you all the way, they're like, I don't disagree that something like

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:37.320
that is very likely to happen, but I had said before the show, I said, watch, because Nintendo

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:42.040
likes to kind of take games and redo them for new consoles, like, these will all be

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:46.080
games on the Wii U, and they'll be able to say that, oh, we're listening, oh, these are

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:51.360
games that the hardcore gamers want, Last Story Plus Edition on the Wii U, it's Last

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.400
Story U, and Xenoblade U.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:26:00.120
No, it's not gonna be that at all, because that would take additional effort.

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:01.400
They're not gonna put in additional effort.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:04.760
I don't even understand what the point is, because like, they've had other games that

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:10.240
they have translated the English and released only in Europe and Japan, and never brought

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:16.400
the Europe version of the game over here, which, I mean, I would think if you're spending

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.480
the money to translate in the English, why not release it over here?

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:23.500
Hell, you don't have to fucking advertise this thing very much, just put it out.

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:28.420
You will sell some copies of it, especially something that people are demanding that be

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:29.420
brought over here.

01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:32.640
Of course, their thought is probably, oh, well, this is such a niche game that no one's

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:36.840
gonna really buy it, but then at the same time, I think, well, let's see, you put out

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:42.160
Mr. Case Files, the Malgrave incident, no one really gives a shit about that.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:45.280
That one just went poof, like, no one even knew that came out.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:50.000
If we had not mentioned that it came out, no one would fucking know that the game came

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.520
out.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.920
It's a bummer that it's the Wii, because if this was the 360 and there wasn't enough fan

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:01.840
demand, we've seen now where that game, and I forget what it was, Death Smile or whatever,

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.280
was that Japanese shooter game that came out in Japan, and they just said, you know what,

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:10.880
we'll put it up as a download title, we're not gonna bother to translate it, though,

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:15.460
so fucking, here it is, just take it, if you want it, but I think people are generally

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:16.460
happy with that.

01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:19.460
And now there are special box sets and everything.

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:24.280
So unfortunately, it would be great if the Wii could support that, but it can't.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280
And on top of that.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.680
Maybe the Wii, maybe the punchline is the Wii U will, and these games will be downloadable

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:30.680
on the Wii U.

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.080
And here's the funny part about that.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.520
On top of the fact that they won't even bring it over here, they give Europe a nice collector's

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:39.400
edition with a controller and everything for them.

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:43.560
So obviously they know that the game's popular, but they just still don't give a fuck about

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.560
you.

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:45.880
Rickster in our chatroom says, why do that?

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:48.120
Nintendo has already put the Wii out to pasture.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.760
And I think that's a good point, is, you know, well, they've already said the Wii U's coming,

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:56.200
so let the Wii die, basically a slow death as we get our last little hurrah Zelda game

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.200
this holiday.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:01.160
The Wii U's and people, and this Wii U isn't coming out until the end of next year, so

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.280
what the fuck are they going to put out?

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:06.840
Is everybody planning on buying a Wii U day one?

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:07.840
No!

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:10.640
If I've learned one thing from Nintendo consoles, no I'm not.

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:14.560
I'm not planning on buying this thing day one, I mean, unless there's that just kick-ass

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.680
must-have game, we'll wait and see.

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:21.560
I am a consumer whore though, so I still may succumb to needing it earlier or something

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:26.880
like that, but it really so far hasn't, I mean it's basically a Wii with better graphics

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:31.200
and a stupid controller that I don't really give two shits about.

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:32.200
But...

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:37.480
But I'm just gonna like, well, when the PlayStation 3 came out, the PlayStation 2 didn't just

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:38.480
roll over and die.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:39.480
No, it still has it.

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:45.400
God of War was still going, and the old systems don't just roll over and die.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.400
So I think these games...

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:50.200
Especially not the Wii, because you have to understand, just because everyone bought a

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.840
Wii does not mean they're going to buy a Wii U.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.320
In fact, I think because you got all these old people and stuff like that to buy Wii's,

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.320
no!

01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:02.320
That is not going to translate into more Wii U sales, just because you can use these Wii

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.320
games on there.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.320
I mean, think about it.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.160
It's like, Rob, I need to buy a Blu-ray player, but hey, it's okay, because I can still play

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.440
my DVDs on it.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:13.080
Well, why am I going to buy a new unit if I already have something that plays DVDs?

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:14.440
It doesn't make any sense.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.440
I gotta say this.

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:18.880
I'm not the only one that doesn't understand your perspective, Loki, of campaign to get

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:22.520
the games out, and then when they come out, say fuck them because of their bad attitude.

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:26.520
Derek H. in our chat room says, wait, so you'd be upset if they do what you want them to

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.520
do?

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:30.760
That's like going to McDonald's, buying a Happy Meal, then throwing it on the ground

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:34.240
yelling, fuck you, Ronald McDonald!

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:38.080
The sad thing is, I can see Loki doing that!

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:40.000
There isn't enough fucking bacon!

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.780
No, it's my problem is, how else then do you teach a company like this that you're not

01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:48.080
going to fucking take their...

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.080
Oh, well, if you're big...

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.560
Well, if you're going to just have to take Reggie and bend him over your knee and say

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.560
you're being very, very...

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:57.280
And it's just like, it's like fucking Konami, you know, with, well, if you really want this

01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:00.080
game to come out, you better have those pre-orders in!

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:03.520
I mean, fuck you, I'm not buying your goddamn game then.

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:07.040
I don't give a shit if you put it out, because it will probably suck anyways, because all

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:11.480
of your games, you know, especially music games, they have really blown.

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:15.720
I like doing the pre-orders to determine things, because that's how we got the low cost on

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.000
the Macross box sets.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.280
I like how the random-ass DDR, just, we can never get away from that.

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.280
Alright.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.000
Well, no, it's because they pulled that bullshit.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Hey, Capcom!

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.400
Why don't you step up and do this bullshit, because, you know, this seems perfectly down

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.400
your alley.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.400
Is that what Nintendo should do?

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:32.640
Should Nintendo put it up on their website and say, okay, if 10,000 people order Xenoblade,

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.560
then we'll put it out?

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:37.840
If that's what it's going to take for them to do it in a timely manner, then fine.

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:38.840
Would you do it?

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.280
No, because I don't want to buy this fucking game.

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:46.200
I don't play the Wii anymore, who do I care?

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.080
Fuck you, Ronald McDonald!

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:52.120
No, I would seriously, I would boycott the game then.

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.600
Oh, well, you don't want to bring it out?

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:56.160
Fine, you just want to put out some more Mario and Kirby games.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:00.160
Kirby, which, by the way, I don't know if anyone still cares about Kirby, but...

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:04.280
This is like the opposite of Operation Rainfall.

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.240
This is Operation Thunder Snow.

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:09.840
Yo, fuck those games!

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:14.480
I think you should start a campaign on Twitter, Operation Thunder Snow.

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:15.600
Don't release those games.

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.440
In fact, don't buy Wii games.

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.880
P.S., fuck you, Ronald McDonald.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.880
No, seriously, okay, let's see you...

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:29.880
Everyone's going to get a fucking raging boner over a goddamn, you know, Skyward Sword.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:34.080
Ooh, it's a Zelda game with stuff in it, I mean...

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:39.700
I gotta say, though, the last story looked fucking great, and I was looking forward to

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:42.360
seeing that announcement in E3, and would I have bought that on the Wii?

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.120
Actually, yes, I think I would have.

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.120
Where are the reviews in Japan?

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:50.040
I have one of those boners for Mistwalker that I kind of do for Q Entertainment.

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:53.560
Like, even their mediocre games I will still support, like Blue Dragon.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:55.240
Hey, Mistwalker, guess what?

01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:59.720
Just because you had Nintendo publish your game in fucking Japan, you know what?

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:01.320
Other companies will fucking publish it over here.

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:04.220
You don't even have to go through all this bullshit of having to beg a company to bring

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:05.220
it out.

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:06.220
Because guess what?

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.560
There's companies like Ignition that have said, hey, you know what?

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:12.600
We're going to try our own internal game development, but that went up in smoke, so we're going

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:15.880
to go and shop games that people want to be brought over here, and we're going to bring

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:16.880
them over here.

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:19.880
Or there's a company called Axis Game Localization.

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:21.440
They localize games!

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:24.360
That's all they fucking do is localize games!

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:30.240
They bring over shit like BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2, and shit like that Guilty Gear that

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:35.640
you would never, ever fucking play if, you know, you relied on Nintendo to bring that

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:36.640
shit.

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.580
Do you know how many decibels I've taken down your mic this episode and it's still

01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:40.480
not enough because you keep getting louder?

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.800
Sorry, I'm just saying that you're just passionate.

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:44.800
I am.

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:45.800
I'm seriously passionate about it.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:50.640
The fact is, I don't think that it should result in people begging a company like Nintendo

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:53.180
to try to get them to understand the niche market.

01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:56.520
You need companies that already understand the niche market and will bring this shit

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.720
over regardless.

01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:00.560
Let me let me ask this and then we can move on with more stories because we're an hour

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.520
and a half into the show and haven't got to the end of party yet.

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.100
What is your passion?

01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:09.920
My passion as far as these games go.

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:12.680
Why do these stories get you so angry?

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:19.400
Because it's this whole, oh, we're this big company and we're just, you know, you should

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.400
be gracious for everything they were putting out.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.760
And they just don't, they think they understand what their users want and they don't.

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:30.500
I mean, their whole focus on, oh, let's, you know, make sure that we're putting out games

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:36.240
that families want to play and elderly people want to play so we can sell lots of Wii systems

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:40.360
and then they get all these systems out and it's like, hey, there's some really good games

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:44.760
that, you know, kind of go towards the niche market of say people are like, you know, Japanese

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:49.080
role playing games, something that's really been underrepresented on the Wii system.

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:53.280
And we could bring this stuff over because we know we're doing the translation for Europe

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:58.500
because, hey, they're a smaller market and I guess that makes it worth translating the

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.400
game for it.

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.120
We could bring this over here with little effort whatsoever, but no, we're going to

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.200
be assholes and say basically, no, we don't.

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.520
We don't have any plans on doing this and yeah, I know that you guys all rallied and

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:13.920
really want this stuff over here and have committed to really going to buy this stuff,

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.880
but you know what we're going to do and say we're going to put out another Kirby game

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:23.120
or maybe another, you know, Mario basketball game or some bullshit like that because we

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:28.020
know that Mario will sell and it requires very little effort on our part and really

01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:31.340
that's what we want to do is spend the least amount of effort possible.

01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:36.600
DJ Morpheus in our time says Loki needs Prozac flavored bacon.

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:38.840
I really want bacon flavored like medicine.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:39.840
That's disgusting.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.960
Why would you want to flavor bacon?

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.320
I think you meant bacon flavored Prozac.

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.280
All right.

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.040
Skye is Loki turning green yet?

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.040
Nope.

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.040
Still as white as you can believe.

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.920
All right, let's move on with another news story and then we'll get into the release

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:54.920
dates.

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:55.920
Dark Sakura.

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.920
Oh, Nintendo.

01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:02.460
You've been a very quiet lady over there and usually you're the opinionated one.

01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:05.360
So I've got to know what is your thought on all this mess?

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.480
Like Nintendo not releasing these.

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.480
Are they being hard-headed?

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.280
Is does it make good business sense?

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:14.180
I say it's average for Nintendo.

01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.360
This is just par for the course.

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.640
I'm used to this shit.

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:20.200
This is why you've just become desensitized to this.

01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.200
Pretty much.

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:24.480
It's basically people- And not like I play my Wii anymore.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.760
Nintendo does something wrong.

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.560
Nikki yells and screams about it, lather, rinse, repeat for the past nine years.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:32.960
It's basically, people are, they're barking up the wrong tree.

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:36.160
They're asking Nintendo to bring over this really niche game when they should really

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:41.200
be bugging these other publishers that put stuff out on the Wii as well as other systems

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.520
to bring over the games.

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:46.640
Because I think these people like, you know, like Atlas, there's another perfect example

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.080
of a company that would do this.

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.000
They, that's all they deal with is niche shit.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
All right, we get it.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
We need the return of working designs.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.120
You know, I actually, one of our pinball tables belongs to the owner of working designs.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.120
Oh really?

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.120
Our Twilight Zone.

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.120
That's kind of rad actually.

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.120
That's how we got our Goemon doll.

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:05.120
All right, let's move on.

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.120
More gaming news.

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:08.800
And uh, oh god, it's another Nintendo story, isn't it?

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:13.600
Yeah, I'll- Oh god, get your earmuffs!

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:22.400
Nintendo plans on spending 16.5 billion yen on a new research and design facility in Kyoto.

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:28.000
This was reported by Miike, which is the Japanese stock market, that they're going to start

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.840
building in January 2012 and will be finished by the end of 2013.

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:40.180
And they have had this in the works since 2009, but the original price they had on it

01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:43.960
was 12 billion yen.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:49.000
They basically are trying to move everything into one house.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:56.000
They are bringing in their R&D offices, all of the main staff.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.640
Everything is going to be under one roof.

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:06.400
So Loki, 16.5 billion yen on a new research and design facility, yet no last story.

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:07.400
What are your thoughts?

01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:10.920
Maybe that's why I spent all this money on a new building.

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:15.160
Well they want to put everyone under one roof, I don't see a problem with that.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.160
Apple's doing the same thing.

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.320
They're building some giant space saucer thing.

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:22.400
They're building a metal donut in the middle of San Jose.

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:27.040
There's no square wall in the building or something like that.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:31.760
They actually wanted to make a building that looks like Steve Job's asshole.

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:35.200
That's what they're building in the middle of San Jose.

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:38.640
So everybody can literally walk up his ass day in and day out.

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:42.160
And it's going to be all made of glass.

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.560
I can actually point out something.

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:48.560
There is a psychological reason that you want to remove hard edges is that it reduces the

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.880
urge for violence.

01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:53.480
Oh, because when I think of Apple products, I think of violence.

01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:55.200
Loki, maybe.

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.960
Maybe it's to make happier workers.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.440
Wow, really?

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:03.920
I know people that would kill someone, literally kill someone in the dead of night to get a

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:04.920
job at Apple.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.480
Like, I don't think of Apple as having angry workers.

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:12.480
I wouldn't do that, no.

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:19.800
The whole, like, fact that, you know, it's been shown that circle buildings or whatever

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:21.760
cause people not to be violent.

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:25.920
Sounds like the hippie mumbo jumbo that Steve Jobs would be spouting anyways.

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:26.920
But you know what?

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:27.920
Hectagons piss me off.

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:33.840
No, I think the whole thing is that he didn't like being called a square.

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:34.840
So that's why.

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:35.840
So, ha!

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:36.840
You can't call me a square now.

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:37.840
You're a fucking idiot.

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:38.840
And a hippie.

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:41.960
We're going to plant some trees.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:42.960
Go plant some trees, Steve.

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:46.200
Well, actually, we're going to plant a lot of trees.

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.600
Don't need to prove me right anymore.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.840
I like how Loki had a wide open door to do more Nintendo bashing and he decided to take

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.840
a pass.

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:53.840
He just...

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:56.440
What am I going to say about Nintendo opening a facility?

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440
Good for them.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.440
They're opening a building.

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:01.040
It's not like this facility is going to research more Mario games.

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.920
I mean, I don't know.

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:03.920
I was...

01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:04.920
It's just...

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:05.920
They're consolidating their stuff.

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.080
Let me get you a little platter and I'm going to hand you the joke on the platter, okay?

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.080
Here it is.

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.080
Look at this.

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:13.080
They're building a...

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:17.120
They're putting all these billions of dollars into a research facility for all those new

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:19.000
franchises they put out.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.700
There you go, Loki.

01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:21.700
It's not...

01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:23.100
Hey, you know what?

01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:26.040
I don't believe they research shit for any of their franchises.

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.960
So that's obviously not what it's for.

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.520
It's for their new consoles that are so innovative and different from their last console.

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:35.840
In fact, this new console, what, it has a tablet for a controller.

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:39.160
That's such a genius idea that they need a new research facility.

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:45.400
Certainly an idea like that only could have come out of a building shaved like a donut.

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:50.600
Basically quite a number of articles I just randomly found from anthropologists, different

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:55.300
biologists, psychologists, all pointing to the...

01:39:55.300 --> 01:40:01.000
By the circle is a comforting and familiar shape to the mind on an unconscious level.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I understand that.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:10.720
Well, as in art, we study the golden mean as a curve, so that it's like the shape of

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:18.720
a shell, the circular shape of a shell, why a more circular face in some cultures is considered

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:19.720
to be more attractive.

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.480
They look for symmetry.

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:24.520
The hecticons are still very rude, right?

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.040
Yes, they are.

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:30.440
So for the record, there actually is psychology behind it.

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:33.480
I don't believe in psychology.

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:38.560
That's clear.

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.640
There's that witty retort I've been waiting for all night.

01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:44.480
All right, let's move on to release dates.

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:47.360
We're going to travel the world and check out what's coming out to a store near you

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.600
and eventually we'll get through this show.

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.520
Loki, I'll save yourself some time because there's only one thing that's coming out this

01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:59.160
week that you really need to pick up and that would be Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:06.280
And that's, of course, assuming that they didn't release it on Saturday wherever you

01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.920
live, because that was the case.

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:11.280
In fact, since we're getting into it now, I will explain why it's being released on

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:16.840
Saturday because it's a funny story, actually, and it also goes to show you GameStop.

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.240
They're fucking assholes.

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.600
Okay, so get this.

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:23.040
D3, they put out the game.

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.920
They shipped it to stores or whatever like that early and stuff like that.

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:32.960
They misprinted the street date number on the master cases that went out.

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.900
So it said, Streets July 2nd, despite the fact that all their paperwork, the street

01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:39.240
date letters, et cetera, say July 5th.

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.320
GameStop's going, no taking backsies, no taking backsies.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:43.400
It fucking says the second.

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:47.780
We're putting it on the second on all systems, even though it was only the 360 master cases

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:50.520
that they messed up on.

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:55.880
Instead of D3 saying, hey, GameStop, I understand that we did misprint that on there.

01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:57.920
But the street date is still the fifth.

01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:58.920
Could you put it on the fifth?

01:41:58.920 --> 01:41:59.920
They're like, fuck you.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:02.080
We're putting it out whenever we goddamn feel like it.

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.800
And so that's kind of what happened.

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:04.800
And because...

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:05.800
Pinchpoke, you owe me a Coke.

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:07.120
No take backsies.

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:13.200
It's basically now everybody's kind of putting it out because, well, GameStop's doing it.

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.840
And they advertise it on the website.

01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:16.840
They call it all their pre-order customers.

01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:17.840
They're assholes.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:20.320
But hey, you know what?

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.120
The benefit of it is that you get to play the game early.

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:26.440
And a lot of people are going to be putting it out as well other than GameStop early.

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:31.120
So you know, bug killing on the 4th of July doesn't sound too bad.

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.320
So the moral of the story is D3, learn to type.

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.320
Yes.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:40.200
And that's coming out on PS3 and 360 this week.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:44.780
And I kid you not, that's literally the only thing that's coming out this week.

01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:47.880
Let's go to Japan and look at the releases there coming out in Japan this week.

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:51.240
Also their own version of Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon comes out this week on the

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.120
360 as well as Knight's Contract.

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:55.520
L.A. Noire finally gets a release this week on the 360.

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:58.320
I'm not sure how localized that game is for Japan.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:02.520
I imagine for it to have come out this fast, it's probably just subtitles and not full

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.400
redone stuff, especially with all the actors and stuff.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.400
It's probably subtitles.

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:07.240
I'm going to just guess on that.

01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:11.800
On the PlayStation 3, Angel Senki comes out as well as Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:14.200
Infamous 2 gets its Japanese release this week.

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.880
Just Cause 2 gets a price reduction.

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:21.800
Knight's Contract, L.A. Noire, a game called R.U.S.E. moves into the Ubisoft best collection,

01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:23.600
Tom Clancy's Hawks 2.

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:26.600
Also a best collection price reduction this week on the PS3.

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:29.480
It's a busy week on the PlayStation 3.

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:34.920
Moving on to other consoles, let's see if I can get to the Wii or the 3DS here, my list.

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:41.960
Oh, my list is starting to show Vita releases, but not until December over in Japan.

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:42.960
No hard dates yet.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:45.200
I think those are all placeholders, just so you know.

01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:50.560
Sony PSP, Suzumiya Haruichan no Mahjong.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:53.640
They're doing a Haruhi Mahjong game?

01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:56.160
Yeah, look at that, right there.

01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:57.160
Check that out.

01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:58.160
I play it.

01:43:58.160 --> 01:43:59.160
And it's Mahjong.

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:00.160
There you go.

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:03.200
I don't know how to play Mahjong, you should teach me.

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.520
You've never played Mahjong?

01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:09.640
Okay, I played Shanghai on the old Macintosh, I don't think that counts.

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:10.640
That's Mahjong Solitaire.

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:13.400
I'm talking about, like, for real, Mahjong.

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:14.400
Oh, okay.

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:15.400
All right.

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:20.400
Tekken 6 gets a price reduction this week on the PSP.

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:24.680
Let's see, the Nintendo Wii, a red Wii remote plus control.

01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.800
That's all that's coming out on the Wii this week.

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:34.520
But 3DS gets a couple games, Dr. Lotrek Toboyaku no Kishidan comes out from Konami.

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:35.920
This is...

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.680
It's Dr. Lork in the, I don't remember the fucking subtitle to it.

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:40.680
Okay, so it's that game.

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:42.080
It's from Konami, it's coming out in September.

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.280
So it's not Professor Layton.

01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:48.320
It's very similar to Professor Layton, but it's not.

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:51.360
Next week, by the way, in Japan, you can look forward to this, not this week, next week,

01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:57.400
the 14th, the Flare Red 3DS and Star Fox 64 are the big releases in Japan next week.

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.280
UK.

01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:05.080
One thing Virtua Tennis 4 on the 8th for PC.

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:06.080
That's it.

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.080
Oh, hooray.

01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:08.080
I love tennis.

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:09.080
Moving on.

01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.280
Who plays tennis on the PC?

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.160
Couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're gonna get to the classic game of

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:16.160
the week.

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:19.360
And I'll tell you what, this week's classic game of the week is old.

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.760
No, really old, you guys.

01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:22.760
Yeah, it is.

01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:23.760
All right.

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:24.760
Loki.

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:30.320
Um, game for Windows, well, at least the marketplace is gonna be no longer, is actually merging

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:35.000
with Xbox.com on July 11th.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.760
And that's all you need to know, I guess.

01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:44.840
They tried to overhaul it back in November, and no one cared.

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:47.440
So now it's gonna be part of the Xbox marketplace.

01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:48.800
Awesome.

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.440
This actually kind of makes sense.

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.440
I mean, games for Windows was having a hard time kind of finding its market, especially

01:45:54.440 --> 01:46:00.960
versus Steam, to merge all the gaming into one place and to really kind of homogenize,

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:06.920
if you will, the Xbox gamertag and the experience and all that, bringing that, you know, connect

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:10.600
to PCs even and all that, kind of bringing that all together.

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:12.520
That all seems kind of smart for Microsoft.

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:15.480
So this seems logical.

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.040
So I guess there's really not a lot else to say on that.

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:19.040
Nope.

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:22.640
It'll be interesting, though, what will happen with the Windows 8 integration.

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.520
That's what I'm most curious about, because you know it'll somehow integrate into Windows

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.520
8.

01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:33.720
And I'm really curious how Microsoft is going to tie together the 360 and Windows 8.

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:36.280
Now there's only so much they can do, because, you know, they don't want to get...

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.680
Well, the new interface looks like Windows 8.

01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:40.260
That's an optional interface, though.

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:41.260
That's one thing that...

01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:42.260
Thank God.

01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:45.680
...they haven't been... that was one type of interface that you can have.

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:47.840
Like Windows will still have the traditional way of doing it.

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:48.840
Oh, wait.

01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:49.840
That's right.

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:50.840
Optional on Windows.

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:51.840
My mistake.

01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:52.840
You know.

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:53.840
Required on 360.

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:54.840
So.

01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:58.020
Well, it's just like, what is that thing called?

01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:01.160
The multimedia Windows thing that you can do on the 360?

01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:02.160
I know.

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:03.160
Windows Media Center.

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.360
Windows Live or whatever.

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:07.800
Like, you know, that was a lot of what was shown in Windows 7, but how many people really

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:08.800
use that?

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:09.800
Like, I can't use that in my house.

01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:11.160
It's too damn slow.

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:14.200
So I don't know how many people use that, but there you go.

01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:15.200
All right.

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:17.600
Anyhow, one other story for you guys, and then we'll get into the Classic Game of the

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.600
Week.

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:21.160
This is about a different classic game, GoldenEye.

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:26.100
A domain has been spotted for a game called GoldenEye Reloaded.

01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.100
Not just one domain.

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:28.360
A bunch of games.

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:34.680
Is it possible that last year's Wii game will be coming out on the 360 and PS3?

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.600
Could it maybe be getting a sequel?

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.840
Nobody or could it just mean fucking nothing?

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:44.440
It could be any of the above, but that domain has been spotted and it indicates that GoldenEye

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:48.640
is not quite dead, even though the Wii version got kind of lukewarm reviews.

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.680
But what would happen if that game came out in HD on the 360 or PS3?

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:55.520
That I would say that's actually kind of rad if that happens.

01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:00.320
Someone had already done the translation to, like, HD already, but it got kind of tied

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.960
up with the whole rights being owned by different people.

01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:08.240
Yeah, but does Activision pretty much solely own the James Bond stuff now?

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:15.320
Yeah, but I think that's why GoldenEye came out on the Wii and not on the other systems,

01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:19.600
because the other James Bond games are terrible.

01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:23.280
All right, let's go to the gaming vault.

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:28.840
And we're going to take a stroll down the gaming lane and find a classic video game

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:33.720
in the vault that Dark Soccer says, hey, you kids need to respect where your games come

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:34.720
from.

01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:38.160
You know, you wouldn't have Earth Defense, Forts, Insect, Armageddon.

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:42.000
You wouldn't have The Last Story or any of these games if it weren't for games such as

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000
this one.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.880
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.200
This is a game that I played when I was five years old.

01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.760
Wow, so this would have been like 50 years ago?

01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:51.760
Shut up.

01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:52.760
Just kidding.

01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:57.840
It's called The Quest for the Rings, and it was on the Odyssey 2 and video pack.

01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:00.880
Came out in 1981.

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:03.880
Let's listen to some of those bleeps and bloops.

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:08.160
Yep, that's what the game sounds like.

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:10.520
That's when it's having you pick your class.

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:14.080
Let me get to something like...

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:17.680
That's going to hurt our listeners' ears, but there you go, it's in the background.

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:18.680
I love this game.

01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:24.880
And keep in mind, I played this game actually for a few years, because when I moved next

01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:29.240
door to a couple other friends, they had an Odyssey 2.

01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:32.720
So I got to play it again, and I loved the game even over the years.

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:37.920
But okay, Quest for the Rings basically was sort of...

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:41.560
It's what Gauntlet should have been based off of.

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:47.760
It was very gauntlet-y, but you know, this came out, you know, four years before Gauntlet

01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:49.920
existed.

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.600
It had a board game released with it.

01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:55.560
It was a combination of a video game and a board game.

01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:02.640
Came in this huge-ass box, it was gorgeous, and you had one person who was the ringmaster.

01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:08.320
So sort of like a combination between playing the D&D board game and playing Gauntlet, you

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:09.320
know.

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:16.320
So, you could play the board game with the stuff that would go on in the Quest mode,

01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:20.800
or you could actually just play the game in Quest mode and play through the different

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:21.800
levels.

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:27.240
This was the game that I was trying to remember the name of, like, a few episodes ago.

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:30.260
So you had four classes that you could play as.

01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:35.400
You could be a warrior, who, he can, you know, kill stuff.

01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:41.200
You could be a wizard who can stun other, you know, enemies.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:50.160
You could also be a changeling, who could turn invisible, except when the changeling

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:53.760
was invisible, you couldn't see him either.

01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:57.560
And then there was the phantom, who could walk through all kinds of walls, except for

01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:00.560
one kind, and he did it at half-speed.

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:05.000
Which actually, I would usually pick either the phantom or the changeling, but the phantom

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.680
was super convenient to have, because there were levels later on where the walls would

01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:11.720
change location.

01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:12.960
It was super aggravating.

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:16.320
Okay, the gameplay video stopped because there was only about two minutes of it, but can

01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:20.120
I, I found this related video that I'd seen before that's actually pretty funny.

01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:21.960
This is how games were marketed back then.

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:24.880
I want to play the commercial for this game real quick.

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:31.880
Wizard of Odyssey, is the keyboard really the key to greater challenge in video games?

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:32.880
Of course it is.

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:34.880
You can play strategy games like Quest for the Rings.

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.880
Plan your strategy on the game board.

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:39.880
Use the keyboard to change heroes, enemies, racers.

01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:42.880
Be a wizard, ultimate, fire a dragon.

01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:43.880
Take that dragon.

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:45.880
We wizards hate to lose.

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:49.880
Master strategy series, only from Odyssey 2, where the keyboard is the key to greater

01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:50.880
challenge.

01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:55.880
By Odyssey, get $82 worth of free games, including Quest for the Rings and Pickaxe Pete.

01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:56.880
Take that dragon.

01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:58.880
I had pick, we had Pickaxe Pete too.

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:02.880
Dude, just $82 worth of games, so that was $41 a piece.

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:09.880
So this game, with its bleepy bloops, $41 in 19, what is this commercial, 1981 I think?

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:10.880
Yeah.

01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:11.880
Was this commercial?

01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:13.880
And that's, I mean games were expensive.

01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:14.880
Yeah.

01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:15.880
So.

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:16.880
Now.

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:17.880
It's interesting too that they used the keyboard.

01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:18.880
It's really the niche for the Odyssey.

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:22.880
I guess just be competitive with the 2600, like real gaming uses a keyboard.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:24.880
Which is funny because that argument is still used today.

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:32.480
Well, the other thing with, with the Odyssey 2 is that it was also advertised as an educational

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:35.080
system too, because there were a number of educational games on it.

01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:39.880
Like one that we used to play all the time was Crypt Equip, where you put in a word.

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:40.880
Okay.

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:44.420
Well, we're still talking classic into the week, so.

01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:49.440
You put in a word and then it scrambles it, and we would always pick one person in our

01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:54.640
group that had to unscramble the word, and so they'd have us face the wall, except whenever

01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:58.520
it was me, I mean I was always really good at it anyway, but the wall that they would

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:01.280
have us face had a mirror on it.

01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:05.440
And I've been able to read backwards since I've been able to read.

01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:07.280
So it was never that difficult.

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:12.200
And this also was a system that had K.C. Munchkin, or was it Munchkin or Crazy Chase that was

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:13.200
the Pac-Man clone?

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.720
K.C. Munchkin I think it's called.

01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:15.720
Yeah.

01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:18.400
Which I've actually got a couple copies of.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.880
But there was a cease and desist put on them.

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:25.560
So to find, I mean it's not really super expensive, but to find a copy of K.C. Munchkin is, you

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.320
know, kind of a find.

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.920
So what made this game awesome to a five year old?

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:34.960
Well, it was just that you could, you know, you could fight a dragon, but the dragon,

01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:37.520
you know, you couldn't kill the dragon.

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:40.840
And it was just an adventure game, like look how awesome the dragon looked.

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.720
The big green blip.

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:43.720
That was serious graphics!

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:44.720
Godzilla!

01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:45.720
It's Godzilla!

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:51.160
I'm going to show everybody what this picture looks like, because I mean seriously, that

01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:55.920
was pretty hardcore awesome graphics for, you know, when I was five.

01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:59.720
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:00.720
Oh, I'm sorry, there's more?

01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:01.720
Yes!

01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:02.720
Oh, it sounded like we were done.

01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:03.720
Alright, then what else?

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:06.480
Well, I was going to tell you about the other things that were in the game.

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:07.480
Oh, okay, well please do.

01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:09.480
Well then let me restart the music.

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:15.160
You had five kinds of monsters, and they had the most awesome names.

01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:21.040
There were orcs and fire wraiths, who were really, they actually looked just alike except

01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:22.040
they were different colors.

01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:23.040
One was pink, one was blue.

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:26.400
Then you had dragons, which they basically moved left and right across the screen, but

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:30.600
if you got in the way, they'd be like ROAR and run at you, and it would be like, oh shit,

01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:32.400
it's a dragon!

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:38.120
And there was the nightmares that had different names.

01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:43.320
There was Spidroth Tarantulas, which is a giant spider, and Doomed Wing Bloodthirst,

01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:50.040
which makes me think that the designers of WoW played this game and took inspiration

01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:52.720
from the characters in the game.

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:59.720
But I mean, I always, this is one game that I seriously thought they should totally remake,

01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:06.520
because it was just, the theory behind it was so awesome.

01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:08.740
It really was.

01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:16.040
It was simple, simple gameplay, but it did it so effectively that I don't think any other

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:21.300
game has been, you know, if I'm looking back to this as one of my favorite classic games

01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:27.400
ever, then, you know, it's gotta have something, say something for it's staying power.

01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:32.280
But I'll go ahead and actually link what the cover looked like in the chat room, because

01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:36.000
it had a really epic 80's cover, because, man, that's when people actually drew shit

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
by hand.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Alright, I'm done.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:43.440
Classic giveaway of the week, the quest for the rings for the Odyssey 2.

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.440
Damn that's old.

01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:48.040
Alright, we're gonna take a break here, but don't worry, there's plenty more of Orange

01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:51.480
Launch Radio to come, thank god there's no work tomorrow.

01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:52.560
Fear!

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.520
So yep, we can stay up late a little bit.

01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:55.520
Pinkberry run!

01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:59.520
Pinkberry closes at 10, we're not gonna be done by 10, I hate to break it to you.

01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:01.160
I'll send the husband to come get it.

01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.160
Now that I can play into.

01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:07.640
Alright, we gotta take a break though, when we come back, there's plenty more Orange Launch

01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:11.040
Radio to come, we're gonna talk about Portal 2, we're gonna talk Minecraft, we're gonna

01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:16.480
talk DDR again, somehow it's making its way into the show, PSP remasters, and plenty more

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:17.560
when we come back.

01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:21.880
Your Twitter topics as well, twitter.com slash o-l-r, get those in in the next few minutes

01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:32.120
so we can talk about that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.320
Welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio.

01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:41.360
We are live on this July the 3rd of 2011 with the 418th episode of Orange Launch Radio.

help spread the word of Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:19.360
You can also visit Ice-Tunes, why did I say Ice-Tunes?

01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:20.680
You're thinking of vanilla ice.

01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:22.640
No, maybe this lovely cup of ice water I have.

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:24.040
In that case you should stop.

01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:28.560
Alright, you can visit us on iTunes and leave us a nice 5 star review or if you are not

01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:32.520
an iTunes user, there's plenty of podcast sites wherever you found this show, you should

01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:35.680
leave a nice review and help send other people over here.

01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.560
While you're out shopping for podcasts, might I recommend one of our other Orange Lounge

01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:46.840
production shows, I guess you could say, The Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth, www.hoardhouse.com.

01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:52.680
It's a show about the world of Warcraft and it's myself and Extifer doing lolsy Warcraft

01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:55.420
chat and this week was a real fun show.

01:57:55.420 --> 01:58:01.000
We talked a lot, there was a brand new patch in WoW this week, 4.2, and also huge news

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
about Warcraft.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.120
It didn't make this show roll, probably because I already talked about it on Hoard House,

01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:09.080
but WoW has gone free to play in some ways.

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:15.160
Level 20, basically what existed as the free trial before is now an unlimited trial, it's

01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:18.760
not capped to 14 days, so you can play all the way to level 20.

01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:21.480
Lots of restrictions with that though, I don't think you can join a guild or what have you,

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:25.240
but more information about the Hoard House Guild and all that stuff is on hoardhouse.com.

01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:28.560
Now DarkStalker, I understand you guested on a Warcraft show this week, right?

01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:29.560
Yes I did.

01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:30.560
Can we talk about it?

01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:31.560
Yeah!

01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:32.560
Ok, cool.

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:38.020
I was on Girls Gone WoW, which you can go to their website at girlsgonewow.net and they

01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:39.480
are UK players.

01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:40.480
Yes.

01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:44.600
Which, we actually got into a discussion about, we really wish that there was some way that

01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:49.800
we could cross zones in play, because you can't play on...

01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:53.640
Oh yeah, it's one of the biggest drawbacks of WoW is that there's no way for us to roll

01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:58.760
on Europe and they can't roll on us, unless you actually buy that region's copy of the

01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:01.600
freaking game and do it that way, and it's kind of a pain in the ass.

01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:02.600
That's butt-tarded.

01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:07.360
So, but the host over there still, we're good net friends, because she's been on Hoard House

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:09.840
a couple of times now and always brings the lulz.

01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:11.760
But I signed up on their forums.

01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:12.760
They're fun people.

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:13.760
Great!

01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:18.920
And we had a really, really good time, really long discussion.

01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:24.040
I hope to go back again, prospects seem hopeful.

01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:25.040
Excellent!

01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:29.200
And they were just great people, all three of them, I really enjoyed the time I had.

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:30.200
Wonderful!

01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:32.720
Don't you just love, what's her name, EJ's accent?

01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:33.720
Yes.

01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:34.720
Love her accent.

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:35.720
Love it.

01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:38.000
I just want to put it in a little voice box and open it.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.400
The haters are gonna hate.

01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:43.520
She says, fuck all, better than anyone I've ever heard.

01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:48.440
Okay, by the way, we got a tweet from the Girls Gone WoW show on Twitter, at twitter.com

01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:51.620
slash o-l-r is our Twitter and ggwshow is theirs.

01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:54.240
I loved having DarkSakura on our podcast.

01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:55.360
She was an amazing guest.

01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:59.160
I'm in your show, kidnapping your host, kisses.

01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:00.160
So.

02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:01.160
Okay.

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:02.160
Hey!

02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:03.160
No!

02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:04.160
You're here first.

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:06.720
I'll call you to that chair.

02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:08.880
No, I think that's great.

02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:13.560
Also, since I said it on Bobby's show tonight, I guess we could say it here.

02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:18.080
There is a third podcast in the works.

02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:19.080
Yes, there is.

02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:22.740
And we're looking at taping the pilot in the next week or so.

02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:25.100
And I'm hoping we'll have more information soon.

02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:26.760
But that's all you get.

02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:27.760
I can say one thing.

02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:28.760
What's that?

02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:29.760
It will involve a Dan.

02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:30.760
Okay, we can say that.

02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:32.280
Yep, it will involve Dan.

02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:33.280
It will involve Dan.

02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:34.280
Yeah, we're gonna leave it at that.

02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:35.280
I said a Dan.

02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:36.280
A Dan.

02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:37.280
It did not say which Dan.

02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:40.280
It will involve a Dan.

02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:42.160
Alright.

02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:44.780
Let's get into some rapid-fire news.

02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:49.340
Let's go to the news that there's lots of news this week and some of it we just don't

02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:53.040
have time to talk 15 minutes about like we did some of those Nintendo stories tonight.

02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:55.320
Loki, why don't you start us off?

02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:56.320
Uh, yes.

02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:57.320
This is kinda neat.

02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:01.920
Kotaku, I don't know if they've been doing the actual translations themselves, but they've

02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:11.200
been running on their website every Thursday starting a couple weeks ago, localized versions

02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:12.880
of Retro Game Master.

02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:19.320
Now for those who haven't heard of Retro Game Master, it's a show in Japan that has this

02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:24.980
game master who plays through old classic games and there's kind of commentary going

02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:25.980
along with it.

02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:29.840
So it's like the same thing I see on billions of YouTube channels and just on TV.

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:34.160
But it's funny, you know, he has trouble with some of the games and it's his commentary.

02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:35.960
Professionally written, I guess?

02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:38.320
I guess, I don't know.

02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:42.680
So the first episode was Ninja Gaiden and then of course this week's episode was Super

02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.200
Fantasy Zone.

02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:50.120
But you can check them out, they're streaming, like I said, every Thursday on their Thursday

02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:54.460
at 8pm Eastern is when they have the thing going.

02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:55.720
So check it out.

02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:59.560
I mean, this is the type of stuff that should have been on G4 back in the day when they

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:00.560
talked about games.

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:04.120
That was the Portal 2 information.

02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:05.120
Portal 2...

02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:06.120
Can I back up real quick?

02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:09.440
Sorry, I was talking to our chatters who now, of course, are asking a ton of questions on

02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:13.040
that little tease about the other podcast.

02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:16.240
They teamed up with Kotaku to put the episodes out?

02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:17.240
Yes.

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.240
That's interesting.

02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:20.880
I mean, I'm not going to Kotaku, it's a fine website, what have you, but it's just interesting.

02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:31.440
It's not like a big Hulu or Netflix or even YouTube, it's a very kind of niche gaming

02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.440
site.

02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:36.040
I mean, it's one of the bigger gaming blogs, certainly, but it's just an interesting path.

02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:41.080
I don't think of Kotaku television very often, so it's interesting for them.

02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:42.080
Yeah.

02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:49.000
So anyways, Portal 2, they had a map contest recently and they've had the winners chosen

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:54.440
for that, and it's part of the Summer Mapping Initiative contest.

02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:59.560
The winning map, I guess a map called Patent Pending, took top prize.

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:06.400
Also another called Infinifling, that was, I guess, focusing on mid-air portaling techniques,

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:07.400
that was second.

02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:12.240
And then Endifice, which is based on some destroyed Aperture Chambers, picked up an

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:13.240
honorable mention.

02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:18.760
Now, all these are available to download at, of course, the Portal website, thinkingwithportals.com.

02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:24.680
And many other user-created levels, so if you've played through Portal 2 already on

02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:29.640
PC and you want to go back and try some custom maps and stuff, you can go and download these

02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:31.560
and it's really easy to access them in-game.

02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:35.320
So I haven't really played around with this yet, but I always thought if this came out

02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:38.080
it would kind of all be integrated into Steam, but it's not.

02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:43.800
Like I have to go to this website and do, like, I don't have to hack my game per se,

02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:44.800
right?

02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:45.800
But don't I have to have this dev mode or something?

02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:46.800
No, not really.

02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:51.800
You just, you pull up the developers, the console in the game by hitting the title key,

02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:54.400
and then you just, there's a simple command you put in there.

02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:55.400
Hmm, okay.

02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:56.400
Well, that's cool.

02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:57.400
To play the stuff.

02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:58.400
So, yeah.

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:03.200
And, I mean, it'd be kind of cool if they integrated it with, like, some sort of map,

02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:06.240
you know, option in, like, a menu or something like that where you can just select a map

02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:07.240
and play it.

02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:10.640
Or, you know, maybe make multiple maps or something like that so you can have your own

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:11.640
single-player campaigns.

02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:17.000
And, of course, obviously, not something that you're going to be able to play on consoles

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
yet.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.600
And then, finally, Left 4 Dead 2, apparently they had a little Easter egg in there.

02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:32.520
There was a community-made campaign called Suicide Blitz 2 in Left 4 Dead 2, and it's

02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:37.020
one of the officially featured fan-created add-ons for the game.

02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:40.800
And it has a very neat Portal 2 Easter egg buried in it.

02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:51.640
Apparently, if you, um, you find a portal, I guess, into the actual Aperture Science

02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:58.320
in there, and it says, uh, you can, um, I guess, figure, you find the Aperture Science

02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:05.040
and also Companion Cube, Propression Gel, Special Infected Zombies, and all sorts of

02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:06.040
neat stuff.

02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:08.840
I was watching the video, there was a video attached to the story that had two giggling

02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:14.080
girls playing the game, and, um, it was, it looked really well done, like, from what I

02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:15.080
was watching.

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:19.080
So, uh, yeah, I mean, it looked like you were frickin' playing Portal, but inside Left 4

02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:20.080
Dead.

02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:22.280
So, I like those wacky, zany crossovers.

02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:26.640
Yes, and I like how you have to find a gnome.

02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:27.640
Yes.

02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:31.720
But they have her voice and everything, the infamous GLaDOS voice is in there.

02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:33.120
So, that's really cool.

02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:34.120
Very cool.

02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:35.120
Alright, going to some other stories.

02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:38.760
Uh, Street Fighter 4, the ports keep on comin'.

02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:41.160
This one is called Street Fighter 4 Volt.

02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:42.840
It's coming out on the iPhone.

02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:46.200
It will have three new fighters and Wi-Fi support.

02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:47.680
Uh, Volt, it's now available.

02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:49.160
It's not something you have to wait for.

02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:52.940
It was announced at a Capcom event in Tokyo, but it's available now.

02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:54.840
There are three new fighters available.

02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:57.200
Balrog, Vega, and Cody.

02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:00.360
Keep in mind that when Street Fighter 4 was ported to the iPhone, not all the fighters

02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:02.320
from the game made it over.

02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:05.360
So yes, having some of these characters in it is new.

02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:07.000
Seventeen fighters available.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:08.000
So there you go.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:13.560
Uh, you can get Volt for a buck, but the price is going up each day by one dollar.

02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:16.800
So about now, it's about $3.99 or $4.99.

02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:20.380
On July 6th, the game will be $6.99.

02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:21.620
That will be its final price.

02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:22.680
But you know what?

02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:26.520
They have these 99 cent sales all the time, so if you miss it, you can like wait a month.

02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:27.520
Just wait.

02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:29.480
You can do it.

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:31.040
That's Street Fighter 4 Volt.

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:36.000
Uh, also, uh, in Retro Gaming's Getting Upgrades, Boulder Dash.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.240
You remember this game, Boulder Dash?

02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:41.520
I remember this because this was huge on the Commodore 64, uh, was the series Boulder Dash.

02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:46.280
And I think a lot of the, um, old PC, er, not PC, sorry, old computing platforms like

02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:49.400
the Apples and so forth, this game saw some type of port on it.

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:51.120
These games were huge back in the 80s.

02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:53.280
Well, it's getting a remake, I guess you could say.

02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:54.680
It's an HD update.

02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:57.880
It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon, July 13th.

02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:01.880
Uh, it will be just shy of the Summer Arcade promotion.

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:06.440
Unfortunately it's going to be going up against Ms. Splosion Man, so, uh, it might fall through

02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:10.800
the cracks a little bit, but if you're fond of the old game on the 64 or whatever computer

02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:14.280
back in the day, Boulder Dash XL is on its way.

02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:19.440
Uh, it will have seven times the amount of caves as the original 1984 version.

02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:21.520
It's coming out from Calypso Media.

02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:26.720
There will be a new puzzle mode with items like speed enhancers and telescoping arms,

02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:28.120
online leaderboards.

02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:31.000
It will set you back 800 Microsoft points.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:37.640
There will also be a PC version late in the summer if you are a personal computing purist

02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:40.640
and you don't want to play the game on one of those evil consoles.

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:46.040
Speaking of evil consoles, there's more news on the Wii U and, uh, it has to do with the

02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:47.280
Zelda game.

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:51.520
Well, Nintendo has come out and said, hey, that Zelda game that'll inevitably come out

02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:56.240
on the Wii U, yeah, it's not really going to look like that E3 demo.

02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:00.960
So that video we showed and all that, that was just, that was all concept videos.

02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:03.720
So just, just so you know, it's not necessarily what's going to happen.

02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:08.240
Hey, you remember when we originally showed Zelda on the GameCube and then we put out

02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:10.640
Wind Waker that was all cel shaded?

02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:13.320
Yeah, that, that might happen too.

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:19.840
This all coming out from an interview with Zelda longtime producer Eiji Onuma who said,

02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:23.720
so when we show a graphic demo, people think, oh, this is what the next Zelda will look

02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:26.520
like, but that's not necessarily the case.

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:31.200
And, uh, they also cite, again, the Wind Waker GameCube comparison there.

02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:35.360
So, uh, confirmed Wii U Zelda to be cel shaded, right?

02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:36.360
Okay.

02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:37.360
Maybe not quite.

02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:39.760
Dar Sakura, what do you have for us?

02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:40.760
Rock Band!

02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:42.640
Because we like Rock Band.

02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:44.800
New download content.

02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:49.640
It will be For What It's Worth by Buffalo Springfield, Man on the Moon by R.E.M., Aerials

02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:55.600
by System of the Down, Hypnotized by System of the Down, and Turning Japanese by The Vapors.

02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:00.880
And for Aerials and Turning Japanese and For What It's Worth, there will be Pro Guitar

02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:05.520
Bass Expansions available for another 80 Microsoft points.

02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:06.960
Yay.

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:11.680
And next up, Final Fantasy Tactics for the iOS is delayed.

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:13.960
That's according to Squeenix's Facebook page.

02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:20.760
Needs a little bit more time, so it's going to be in late July instead of June, um, as

02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:21.760
they said it would.

02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:25.240
I think that might be a little old, but it's going to be on, you have to have the bare

02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:28.200
minimum of an iPhone 3GS to play it.

02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:33.440
And this is the remake of the Playstation 1 version, so it's the good one.

02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:38.600
And then, last but not least, oh, you addict people, Minecraft!

02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:44.160
They passed 10 million registered users.

02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:48.400
And that's according to Marcus Person's blog.

02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:56.840
So they are now officially at 10,005,304.

02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:00.600
The people who actually bought it are in the 2 million range, so.

02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:01.600
That's still pretty good.

02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:05.120
2 million copies of the game, 1 out of every 5 are buying it.

02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:06.120
Yeah.

02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:07.120
That's not bad.

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:13.680
But they say that basically they're getting 42,000 new players registering in the last

02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:15.680
24 hours.

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:17.640
Can I take my registration back?

02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:18.640
Just kidding.

02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:21.640
I'm not that big a jerk, I promise.

02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:23.880
Well yay for Minecraft, and yay for our Twitter!

02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:29.200
Every week you guys send us tweets at twitter.com slash O-L-R, and we read some of your tweets

02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:31.280
here live on air.

02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:32.800
Not a lot of tweets tonight, actually.

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:35.800
There's like, not a lot of Twitter news tonight.

02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:42.840
Uh, MNZeba says this tweet saying, uh, Xenoblade, or Monado, Beginning of the World, is actually

02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:49.000
number 3 on the Best Sellers in Nintendo Wii Action Games list at Amazon.com.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:52.240
And she gives us a link here to Amazon.com Best Sellers.

02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:55.600
It's actually up to number 2 now, just so you know.

02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:00.080
Super Smash Bros. Brawl is the game that's beating it, and it in turn is beating, Monado

02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:07.520
is beating Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Lego Star Wars.

02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:09.120
So, interesting.

02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:13.200
I mean, granted, keep in mind, we are looking at just the action game list.

02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:15.800
I want to see where it ranks overall.

02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:21.640
I'm looking at the overall list, and it's number 16.

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:27.160
That's still not bad overall, but just so you know, overall, Monado is being beat by

02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:35.480
a Wii Nunchuck controller in black, and the HD component cable, which is number 8.

02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:40.480
Another tweet to us from Tiger Claw sends us a tweet saying, Space Station internet

02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:43.000
too slow for online video games.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.720
Uh, let's see, it links us to a Kotaku article here.

02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:50.040
Regarding life in space, everyone has three questions.

02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:51.040
How do you poop?

02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:53.400
Has anyone screwed, and can you play video games up there?

02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:55.680
They poop in a vacuum tube.

02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:56.680
It's true.

02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:57.680
They poop in a vacuum cleaner.

02:11:57.680 --> 02:11:59.080
Our soccer would know the answer to that.

02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:05.280
Anyhow, a Canadian astronaut, I didn't know they had astronauts in Canada.

02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:06.280
Canadians in space.

02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:08.680
That'd be a great sitcom.

02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:14.080
Anyhow, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield said that the internet connection aboard the

02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:18.040
International Space Station is simply too slow for games.

02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:23.280
He compared it to a 56K dial-up modem, but I guess the reason why it stinks is because

02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:26.300
of the space station's orbital velocity speed.

02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:31.960
That thing moves at 5 miles per second, because keep in mind, it's orbiting the Earth.

02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:36.520
So Hadfield was the first Canadian to walk in space, and he's going to be, he's in line

02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:39.760
anyway to become the first Canadian commander of the space station.

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:41.920
And clearly he must be a gamer.

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:44.960
This all came out during a Canada Day event in Edmonton.

02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:46.600
So thank you for the link, Tiger Claw.

02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:49.400
Uh, Blinder says it's a tweet.

02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:55.240
Blinder222, to be specific, on Twitter, says, did any of you play the Uncharted 3 beta?

02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:56.880
Sadly, I haven't.

02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:03.000
I want to, but I just registered my PlayStation Plus yesterday, because remember, oh by the

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.280
way, PSA, it's July 3rd, this is like the last chance for you to get the stuff in the

02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:08.280
Welcome Back program.

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:10.600
You don't have to download that stuff, you just have to pick what you want.

02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:11.600
Oh, really?

02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:12.600
I think.

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:13.600
I mean, I'm assuming, because it appeared on my-

02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:15.880
Just fucking download it if you're going to get it.

02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:16.880
The servers are fine now.

02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:22.200
No, it appeared on my, uh, my download list now, but it's just, I, you know, because I

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:25.800
have my PlayStation up in the front room and I have to drag, you know, an ethernet cable,

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:29.760
because remember, old ass PlayStation, no Wi-Fi built in, because it's a 20 gig.

02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:35.720
Um, so I have to put, um, you know, an ethernet cable, drag it into the front room, and see,

02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:40.080
last night I wanted to play Earth Defense Force online as well, and yeah, I can do that

02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:43.480
with my console, but for some reason I wanted to plug it in.

02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:49.360
Anyhow, uh, yeah, so I, I, I'm going to check it out hopefully in the next week, but I tell

02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:51.080
you guys, I have like a backlog of games to play.

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:56.600
I still have Loki's L.A. Noire, I haven't even touched yet, and I have, um, uh, two

02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:00.720
racing games that I have for my rental service, and I have touched none of it, because I've

02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:03.720
been playing this new Warcraft patch, I've been playing the other games I've been talking

02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:07.000
about, and Final Fantasy 13, I'm up to 30 hours in Final Fantasy 13.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Rob.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.000
What?

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Are your racing games PS3, any of them?

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.960
They're Xbox 360, but they're from my rental service.

02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:16.880
Oh, I was gonna say, uh, we've got like a huge driving setup for PS3.

02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:17.880
Oh, fun.

02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:19.040
Nah, it's 360.

02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:25.600
I got, it's, uh, Test Drive Unlimited 2, and one of the, one of the Need for Speed games,

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:26.600
whatever.

02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:27.600
Shift 2 Unleashed?

02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:28.600
Uh, I think it's...

02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:29.600
Or is it Hot Pursuit?

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:30.600
I think it's Hot Pursuit.

02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:31.600
I don't, I, I have to look.

02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:32.600
I don't remember.

02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:36.000
What's the, not, wait, no, isn't Hot Pursuit the one they just announced that isn't even

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000
out yet?

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.680
No, the runs the one they, they announced, Hot Pursuit is the one that came out last

02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:40.680
November.

02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:41.880
Oh, that one looks badass, I gotta say.

02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:43.720
That new one looks fucking rad, I wanna play that.

02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:47.480
No, Hot Pursuit is the one that came out back in November, Shift 2 Unleashed was the one

02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:50.880
that's sort of like Project Gotham that came out back in March.

02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:53.640
And then, uh, yeah, the run's the one that's coming out later on.

02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.320
So yes, at some point, I will get to Uncharted 3 before they close the beta, it's just, you

02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:00.780
know, I gotta, I actually have a pretty big gaming queue right now of stuff I wanna play,

02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:04.840
and I'm still trying to beat Final Fantasy 13, which is just, like, I'm, like, so into

02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:05.840
it right now.

02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:06.840
And, like, it's spreading.

02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:09.400
Like, did you see Bobby Blackwolf, our, uh, guy before us here?

02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:10.400
I should finish mine.

02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:14.280
He, he posted a tweet last night, he said, you know what?

02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:18.180
After a year, it's time for me to beat Chapter 10, which is funny, because I didn't struggle

02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:19.320
on that same boss fight.

02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:21.720
There were boss fights I struggled on, but not that one.

02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:25.000
There were some, there were some Eidolon fights that made me wanna just, ugh.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:31.920
I'll have Saz's Eidolon, I, I, I, oh my god, I went crazy on that fight, just so you know.

02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:36.000
I have to find my save, it's on one of the hard drives I have, because I've swapped hard

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000
drives around.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.600
I know it's not on that console, because, um, you know, that's the internal hard drive.

02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:44.520
But I have to track it down, and once I do, then I'll play it.

02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:46.520
Alright.

02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:47.520
Let's move on.

02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:54.360
Uh, another tweet, last tweet here, from TigerClaw305 on Twitter, Professor Layton movie is getting

02:15:54.360 --> 02:16:00.280
a US release, and, oh, I hate these websites that have ads you have to click through, uh,

02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:08.080
let's see, um, Professor Layton, a manga and an animated feature film, the latter, Professor

02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:13.200
Layton and the Eternal Diva, excuse me, was first released in Japan in December 09.

02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:16.680
It wasn't something you'd necessarily expect to make it out of Japan, but an English version

02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:19.520
was created for British markets and was released last year.

02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:24.000
See how they do that Nintendo, they release something that's, you know, English language

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:28.200
and release it in British markets, and then they can come over here without any, any effort

02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:31.020
whatsoever, because it's already translated into English.

02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:35.400
As revealed at Anime Expo 2011 this weekend, the feature length animated film is on its

02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:39.160
way to North America, reports Anime Your Way.

02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:42.680
It was actually fairly well received, and the developer, Level 5, has already commissioned

02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:44.560
a sequel and would like a new movie out annually.

02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:49.200
And I'd like to add also, but seeing as we're talking about anime movies coming out soon,

02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:52.840
um, they announced a Trigun movie coming out, and that's awesome.

02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:54.200
The trailer, did you watch it?

02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:55.200
Yes I did.

02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:56.440
Oh, that's so nice.

02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:00.160
It will take place, obviously, during the series, because, uh, for, you know, obvious,

02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:02.160
obvious reasons.

02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:05.760
But that is very exciting.

02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:08.800
Alright, that's it for Twitter topics tonight, let's get back to some other gaming news,

02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:09.800
Loki.

02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:13.000
Alright, let's talk a little bit about Minecraft, since, uh, we were just talking about Minecraft

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.000
not too long ago.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:23.360
Uh, Minecraft 1.7 is out now, and it adds pistons and deadly sheep, because, you know,

02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:27.800
I think that kind of reminds me of, what was it, the black sheep, um, movie that they put

02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:29.840
out a while ago, where the sheep are zombies.

02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:30.840
It's funny.

02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:34.960
Uh, but yes, pistons, though, you can make, uh, more complex machines now, so that's kind

02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:36.520
of cool.

02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:46.760
And, um, also, apparently, uh, Minecraft update 1.8 has been, uh, delayed a little bit, by

02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:53.760
a week, and 1.8 would add, uh, the Minecraft Adventure mode, and that'll be coming, uh,

02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:54.760
very soon.

02:17:54.760 --> 02:18:01.960
Apparently, um, 1.8 is released in the next few months, and they're saying that they're

02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:10.240
also starting the crunch for the full release, which is gonna be on 11.11.11, so, yeah, neat.

02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:15.960
And the Adventure mode, I believe, was, like, where you can actually create your own, um,

02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:20.440
I think, I know that they've added maps recently, but, uh, maybe you can make your own kind

02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:22.160
of, like, Zelda-type game or something.

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:24.880
It should be kind of neat.

02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:27.120
Definitely adding a lot more stuff to this.

02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:32.600
At some point, I'll have to check it out, just not yet.

02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:33.600
All right.

02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:34.600
Uh, DDR News.

02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:39.440
Uh, Dar Toagak wants to know, before I get to DDR News, does Loki have Minecraft, question

02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:40.440
mark.

02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:41.440
That's from our chatroom.

02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:44.280
Um, I have it on my iPod, actually.

02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:45.280
Oh, that's interesting.

02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:50.280
Uh, cause, you know, that one, uh, Minecraft app or whatever that came out and they got

02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:53.600
pulled immediately, yeah, I found it.

02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:59.320
So, um, I have that, but I haven't really, I mean, trying to use it on iPods is just,

02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:00.320
it's retarded.

02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:02.080
Um, no, I haven't really played it yet.

02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:05.800
I had, I thought I had downloaded it at one point, but I, I guess not.

02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:12.760
All right, um, moving on to, uh, DDR, and this is about a new arcade release.

02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:18.000
It's Dance Dance Revolution X3, uh, Konami is moving on with the DDR series, which I'm

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.400
just kind of like shaking my head at, but, um, I don't know, I do find this kind of interesting.

02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:29.080
The full title of the game is going to be Dance Dance Revolution X3 versus Dance Dance

02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:31.360
Revolution Second Mix.

02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:36.560
There will be a second mix mode in the game where you can play the full version of Dance

02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:42.320
Dance Revolution Second Mix, including all the licensed music that appeared in that game.

02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:44.740
Would that include Strictly Business?

02:19:44.740 --> 02:19:45.740
Because that song-

02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:46.740
That would be great.

02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:48.120
I don't think that is possible.

02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:51.800
I think Strictly, it's got to come from the version where Strictly Business got taken

02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:55.800
out and a different song got put in, but anyway, we're digressing into too much DDR nerddom.

02:19:55.800 --> 02:20:00.080
Uh, but anyhow, there, they will be introducing new features into the Second Mix game, including

02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:02.040
eAmusement capability.

02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:05.960
Of course, X3 is really the highlight, and that's the game they want you to play.

02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:11.800
Four hundred and eighty tracks in total, uh, standard DDR music, uh, mix songs, uh, let's

02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:16.840
see, uh, variety of Bimani artists, transplant songs from other Bimani series, eAmusement

02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:21.240
Gate, a community-oriented website for Konami games that allows players to form groups,

02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:23.200
share scores, and interact with other players.

02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:27.320
That actually sounds kind of cool, um, will it make an arcade here?

02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:28.320
I don't know.

02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:30.080
Could it get a home release that good?

02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:31.080
Doubt it.

02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:32.080
See, that's the-

02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:33.080
That's the-

02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:34.080
Why can't I get that as a home release?

02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:38.640
See, this is what pisses us off so much, is like, they put all this effort into DDR for

02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:44.400
the arcade, which, you know, we would love to believe that the arcade is still, you know,

02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:52.320
a viable place to have these type of games, but at the same time, they can't just strictly

02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:54.960
port this to the home console.

02:20:54.960 --> 02:21:00.440
Whatever happened with the problem being, you know, back in the PlayStation 1 days,

02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:04.080
just take the arcade release, you put it- bring it home, and you add a couple things.

02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:05.080
Done.

02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:06.080
That's it.

02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:07.080
People loved it.

02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:08.760
Now you gotta change it up now.

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:11.080
I don't understand the point.

02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:17.800
Oh, it's because probably licensing 480 songs for home would be a little bit expensive,

02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:18.800
I guess.

02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:20.800
I don't know.

02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:21.800
Alright.

02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:26.640
Well, I'm- I'm curious about this whole, like, second- I mean, second mix, just to put it

02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:30.240
in perspective for those that haven't followed DDR like we have, it's like 11 years old.

02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:31.720
What- the game came out in 99, right?

02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:34.240
That was the first one I owned, was second mix on Dreamcast.

02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:37.200
Yeah, so it's weird that they're kind of going back to that.

02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:41.080
I mean, dude, I wonder if second mix will have- what was that fucking mode that's only

02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:42.080
in second mix, Jamie?

02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:43.080
It was like your favorite fucking mode?

02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:44.080
Oh shit.

02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:45.080
Unison?

02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:46.080
Dance battle.

02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:47.080
Dance battle.

02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:48.080
Maybe that'll come back.

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:49.080
Yeah.

02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:50.080
That would actually be kind of rad.

02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:51.080
Dance battle was awesome.

02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:52.080
Dance battle's the one where you would have a measure where you could just make up your

02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:54.280
own steps, and then the other player had to do them.

02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:55.280
Yeah.

02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:58.560
So you could just- You could only have like two- two things at any beat at a time.

02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:02.920
Yeah, I mean, you couldn't go too shit crazy, but they would have to do whatever you just

02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:03.920
did.

02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:06.760
I mean, we used to just try to fuck each other's day.

02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:10.560
And also, on top of that, there was no Vivid.

02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:12.040
It was all flat.

02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:13.040
Ooh.

02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:17.120
We didn't have any of them speed modifiers either.

02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:22.240
We didn't have any of them fancy full video backgrounds neither either.

02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:27.480
I mean, this was at third Korean where you could switch it into second mix.

02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:28.960
Yes.

02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:32.880
Or SSR mode in second mix on the Dreamcast one.

02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:33.880
Oh yeah.

02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:34.880
Yeah.

02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:35.880
You know what SSR was, people?

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:39.720
Those were all the nine footers.

02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:43.040
I'm really curious to see how this translates in the arcades, but we'll see.

02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:45.040
They'll fuck it up somehow.

02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:46.040
Prove me wrong, Konami.

02:22:46.040 --> 02:22:47.040
I dare you.

02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:50.920
You should play Strictly Businesses, our transfer music, after birth.

02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:51.920
Remind me after the show.

02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:52.920
All right.

02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:53.920
Moving on.

02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:54.920
Ah.

02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:55.920
Dark Sakura, right?

02:22:55.920 --> 02:22:56.920
Oh, yes.

02:22:56.920 --> 02:22:57.920
Sorry.

02:22:57.920 --> 02:22:59.600
Stop playing on Facebook.

02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:00.600
We're trying to do a show.

02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:01.600
Nah.

02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:03.840
By the way, can I say something that's pissing me off about Facebook?

02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:04.840
What?

02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:07.160
I'm still not in the Civ world beta.

02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:08.160
That pisses me off.

02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:09.160
Just saying.

02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:10.160
Sorry, Rob.

02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:11.160
I'm mad.

02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:12.160
Don't be mad.

02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:13.160
Get even.

02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:14.160
So, guess what?

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:25.160
Kazuo Hirai is now the chairman of Sony SEI.

02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:30.400
Yeah, he's now the head doodoo in charge.

02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:34.600
And guess who is replacing him as group CEO?

02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:36.320
That would be Andrew House.

02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:37.320
He's taking over.

02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:42.800
But guess what's happening to Ken Kutaragi, the crayon eater and helmet wearer.

02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:47.800
He's retiring for reals, except he's going to hang around as senior technology advisor.

02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:51.800
He's going to a very special home where they serve crayons for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

02:23:51.800 --> 02:24:00.300
He's going to be eating the rest of his dinner through straws for the rest of his life, because

02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:03.920
they don't give you food that you can hurt yourself with in the home.

02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:07.880
He's going to be eating some gurber.

02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:08.880
No.

02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:16.720
But yeah, he actually did retire, but he's remaining behind as senior technology advisor.

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:23.920
And yeah, it seems like a really crappy time to do, like, oh, you just had the most insecure

02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:25.480
system ever, blah, blah, blah.

02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:26.880
Oh, here's a promotion.

02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:31.760
But really, the fact is that Akira Sato retired.

02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:37.640
So that's why they're shoving people up.

02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:40.520
We knew there was going to be a management shakeup coming, though, after everything that

02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:41.520
they went through the past few months.

02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:44.000
But I thought it would be deserved firings.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Sackings.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.200
I like the word sacking a little more.

02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:51.200
The people have been sacked.

02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:52.800
I would like them to be rendered redundant.

02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:54.640
All right, moving on.

02:24:54.640 --> 02:24:57.520
Loki, what do you got for us?

02:24:57.520 --> 02:24:58.720
We were talking...

02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:00.760
You're watching the Giggling Girls video, aren't you?

02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:01.760
Yes, I am.

02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:02.760
It looks like it's...

02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:03.760
Oh my god, it's so awesome!

02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:06.400
Oh my god, it's GLaDOS, oh my god!

02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:09.920
And now for two Giggling Schoolgirls.

02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:12.560
By the way, that is the third podcast that OLR is working on.

02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:14.120
It's Giggling Girls playing video games.

02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:15.120
I'm just kidding.

02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:18.040
Wouldn't that be the Giggling Lesbian Show?

02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:20.560
I wish, if they still lived here.

02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:21.560
Anyways.

02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:32.600
The PSP remaster titles that were announced during both E3 and at their own events, they're

02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:38.280
basically able to do this because of the help of a PSP engine, a software development kit

02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:45.720
that Sony put out regarding these PSP remaster titles that allows them to be able to port

02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:47.720
them into HD.

02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:54.640
And with high-resolution rendering, stereoscopic 3D, and wireless controller support for Dual

02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:55.640
Shock 3.

02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:00.540
And apparently, they haven't announced any more remaster titles other than Monster Hunter

02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:06.000
Portable III, and then also, of course, there's, I mean, they call it the remaster title, but

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:12.760
the God of War Origins collection, which is coming out, that's basically the two PSP God

02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:16.360
of War games.

02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:20.120
But yeah, it looks like we're going to see a lot more of these, because they've run out

02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:22.120
of ideas.

02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:23.760
Funny!

02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:27.320
Sorry, I'm slow.

02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:30.360
I'm chatting with listeners about Final Fantasy XIII.

02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:34.640
We're talking about what parties we use, and they're telling me that, somebody, who's telling

02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:40.000
me that they use, Dungeon Buster is saying, I think it's lightning saws and vanilla, I'm

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.000
like, who do you have as a sentinel?

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.440
Because you don't have a sentinel in that party.

02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:46.040
Like, you have to have Fang or Snow, and I don't use Snow because he's a whiny vagina,

02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:49.680
but I like Fang, because she's hardcore, so I use her as my sentinel.

02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:50.680
Anyway.

02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:54.040
Oh yeah, PSP remasters, cool, cool deal.

02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:55.840
Any of those worth getting, you think?

02:26:55.840 --> 02:27:03.280
Um, I didn't really play Monster Hunter, and God of War, I don't know, God of War would

02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:05.180
be fun to play, I guess.

02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:09.760
I haven't really played in, I only think I went through all the way in two.

02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:16.120
I know I didn't play all the way through in one because my, it glitched out of me in one,

02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:21.120
the very last boss.

02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:29.520
Going on to anticipated games, Gears of War 3 has leaked to the internet already, uh oh,

02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:34.200
this is a, not a finalized build by the way, but it does have the full campaign and there

02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:36.060
are some multiplayer modes.

02:27:36.060 --> 02:27:39.800
This could be the E3 build of the game, but not sure.

02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:43.880
They say it's a developer build, or what they call, oh and you've heard this term on the

02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:46.420
show before, a JTAG version of the game.

02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:49.880
You may need a special modified Xbox 360 or dev kit to run it.

02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:50.880
It's a developer.

02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:55.680
But Loki would never indulge in that, because that would be wrong to download that and play

02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:56.680
that.

02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:02.720
Yes, that would be wrong, and it's a developer version of the game, because JTAGs basically

02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:06.240
can operate like a developer's console.

02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:09.720
I have a dev kit too, so that'd be.

02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:14.920
So if you're trying to keep yourself spoiler free on Gears of War 3 stories, you might

02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:15.920
want to leave the internet.

02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:19.620
Yeah, you might want to take a break from the internet for about six months, or whenever

02:28:19.620 --> 02:28:21.280
this game is supposed to come out.

02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:22.800
Uh, yeah, careful.

02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:29.760
Because they do have, I mean they have a bunch of different, I guess, builds in here.

02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:34.800
Uh, they have like a testing, shipping, release, and then multiplayer.

02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:38.920
So they're testing a bunch of different things.

02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:40.960
By the way, I love having a podcast.

02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:41.960
Can I just say that?

02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:42.960
I love this.

02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:45.720
Like, you know, I was just bitching a minute ago that I'm not playing Civ World, and one

02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:48.560
listener just said, oh, there's an invite in your inbox now.

02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:49.560
Awwww.

02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:51.560
Love the internet.

02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:53.160
Love it.

02:28:53.160 --> 02:28:54.160
I love it.

02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:55.680
I wish Google Plus had been that easy.

02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:59.120
If I didn't invite you, like, during that 90 minute window that one night, you got screwed.

02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:00.320
I didn't get my invite.

02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:01.840
I know, because they shut it off.

02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:04.400
Like, I cannot invite people now to Google Plus.

02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:06.000
Fucking retarded.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.080
It'll be, it'll be opened up soon.

02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:09.080
For others.

02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:10.080
We'll see.

02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:12.760
Uh, there's not a lot on there right now.

02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:15.860
It's just, you know, yay, I'm on Google Plus and it's not Facebook.

02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:18.520
Like that's what every status update I see on there is right now.

02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:21.160
Hey, it's not Facebook.

02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:26.200
Also it's not Facebook, but is ten times more awesome is our mailbag.

02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:28.620
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:32.520
Every week DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and dives in and reads some emails.

02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:36.280
She's gonna share them with you right now if she can stop playing on Tumblr.

02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:39.360
I'm putting something important to other artists on there.

02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:42.040
Well, I will tell you what it is, because it's actually pretty cool.

02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:50.240
The iCloud logo is actually using the golden ratio, um, as its design background, so anyway.

02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:51.240
Nyeh.

02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:52.240
It's important.

02:29:52.240 --> 02:29:53.240
See?

02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:54.240
People like circles.

02:29:54.240 --> 02:29:55.240
Okay.

02:29:55.240 --> 02:30:00.800
This one is from Robbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb, it's called Implications of Brown vs. EMA Ruling.

02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:02.480
You'll talk the subject to death this week.

02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:06.760
I find whenever I try to explain this to a non-gamer, they not only don't care, but they

02:30:06.760 --> 02:30:08.880
think it doesn't affect them.

02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:12.720
Every time they play Solitaire, Farmville, Bejeweled, take an online test, give games

02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:17.080
to their kids, or anything else software related, they're doing so without fear of breaking

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:19.240
a bunch of state-by-state laws.

02:30:19.240 --> 02:30:23.640
Soon we won't do anything without some sort of interactive media, be it a question or

02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:24.640
a controller.

02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:26.240
It affects everyone in the USA.

02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:30.200
My two bits without repeating a story, Robbbbbbbbbbbb.

02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:33.920
I've given him some more bubbas.

02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:35.000
And okay.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:40.680
There is, uh, a couple, actually one from Game Politics, another story that he linked,

02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:44.120
about Star Wars Galaxies players filing a class action lawsuit.

02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:45.400
Wow, really?

02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:49.480
I want to know more about that, actually, because the game is shutting down soon, right?

02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:50.480
Yeah.

02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:51.480
So they're filing class action lawsuits?

02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:52.480
Why?

02:30:52.480 --> 02:30:55.880
It's one of the lifetime subscriptions, isn't it?

02:30:55.880 --> 02:31:00.880
So basically it says that more than 50 Star Wars Galaxies players are filing a class action

02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:07.960
lawsuit against Sony, and there are a bunch of other players that says that they will

02:31:07.960 --> 02:31:14.600
do the same thing, um, because Sony is shutting down, they basically are having, you know,

02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:18.680
their petitions go up, but the problem is that they agreed that Sony could cancel the

02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:20.520
game at any time.

02:31:20.520 --> 02:31:23.800
So uh, they're SOL.

02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:28.120
I'm pretty sure that's in the terms of service for any MMO, even Warcraft.

02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:29.800
They can pull the plug at any time.

02:31:29.800 --> 02:31:31.840
Remember Warcraft shut down in China for four months?

02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:32.840
That could happen here.

02:31:32.840 --> 02:31:33.840
Yeah.

02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:34.840
It won't, but it could.

02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:43.720
Well, also, um, about the whole Resident Evil mercenaries, basically, um, Amazon customers

02:31:43.720 --> 02:31:50.040
are actually putting like huge, huge negative reviews on Amazon.

02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:54.640
Like there is one person saying, I don't care how much fun this game is or how good it looks

02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:56.200
or how much it costs.

02:31:56.200 --> 02:31:57.760
There's one save slot.

02:31:57.760 --> 02:31:59.840
Save data is permanent and cannot be deleted.

02:31:59.840 --> 02:32:04.040
Capcom is attempting to set a new precedent and consumer manipulation and control with

02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:07.280
this product.

02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:11.360
Yes.

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:17.880
And then, um, dear Sakura, Loki and Roger.

02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:21.960
Roar, this is Roger Roberts.

02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:28.520
This, this week a game company did slash said slash didn't do slash didn't say something.

02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:31.400
This thing is the worst thing in the history of the world and ever.

02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:32.400
That's bad.

02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:33.400
Roar.

02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:34.400
112.

02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:37.060
Stay black for entertainment.

02:32:37.060 --> 02:32:40.920
This message has been brought to you by corn corn, great addition to tacos, bad addition

02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:41.920
to Silent Hill.

02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:46.480
After all, adding corn to tacos has never caused haze.

02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:48.880
Not for my iPad.

02:32:48.880 --> 02:32:50.920
I'm allergic to corn of all kinds.

02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:54.160
So I'm assuming my name got auto corrected to Roger.

02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:56.040
No cause Julian called you Roger.

02:32:56.040 --> 02:32:58.280
Oh, he said happy birthday Roger.

02:32:58.280 --> 02:32:59.280
That's right.

02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:00.280
Happy.

02:33:00.280 --> 02:33:01.280
That's right.

02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:02.280
I remember now.

02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:03.280
Shit, I forgot to bring back the cake plate.

02:33:03.280 --> 02:33:04.280
God damn it.

02:33:04.280 --> 02:33:05.760
Which by the way, a certain someone is listening right now.

02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:06.760
Hi.

02:33:06.760 --> 02:33:10.320
Oh, I hope, I hope the four year old's not listening with all our potty mouth language.

02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:15.360
Didn't you say you wanted to say something to...

02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:16.680
I said it on Facebook.

02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:17.680
Okay.

02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:18.680
Take care of that.

02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:19.680
Okay.

02:33:19.680 --> 02:33:20.680
I didn't know you wanted to say something publicly.

02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:21.680
Well thank you for the cake.

02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:22.680
I think I expressed that last week.

02:33:22.680 --> 02:33:23.680
Sorry.

02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:24.680
No, no, no.

02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:25.680
It's fine.

02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:26.680
Nah.

02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:27.680
Okay.

02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:28.680
This is from Chiggers, which that's the worst nickname ever.

02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:29.680
Okay.

02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:30.680
I'm sorry.

02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:31.680
No, I love that nickname.

02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:32.680
Do you know what, do you know what those are?

02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:33.680
Uh oh.

02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:34.680
Is this something really...

02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:39.040
They're bugs that burrow under your skin and lay their eggs and infect under your skin

02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:43.320
and then the eggs hatch and they come out of your skin leaving these weird zombie like

02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:44.480
trails on your arms.

02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:46.320
I've seen it happen.

02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:47.320
That's kind of awesome actually.

02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:48.320
It's really disgusting.

02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:52.700
Um, dear OLR, long time listener, six years, first time emailer.

02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:58.540
By the way, hearts, I've noticed PS3 is now starting to put out TurboGrafx-16 games.

02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:02.680
Do you think it's possible they may try and get some games that were released out on the

02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:06.280
NES or Saturn from any third party publishers?

02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:08.920
Keep up the good work and belated happy ninth anniversary.

02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:12.080
Yours truly in Hoard House, Gildy, Chiggers.

02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:15.520
I really hope that you didn't name yourself after a bug that lays skin and...

02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:17.000
I kind of hope you did.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:21.320
Lays eggs in your skin and explodes everywhere into red bloody masses.

02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:24.360
And Becky says she has no idea why Julian called you Roger.

02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:27.120
Cause kids get confused sometimes.

02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:28.120
He was nice.

02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:29.120
It's cute.

02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:30.120
Four year olds can get away with it cause it's cute.

02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:32.120
And then he screamed.

02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:40.400
Anyhow, as far as the whole PlayStation 3 TurboGrafx-16 games, no, they will not get games on the

02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:42.320
NES, SNES, or any of that because that talks...

02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:43.920
Even if they were third party.

02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:47.800
Even if they were third party because you're emulating the hardware that doesn't belong.

02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:50.400
And so I think the whole licensing and all that would be...

02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:54.180
I mean they would have to completely redo the game.

02:34:54.180 --> 02:34:55.180
Completely redo it.

02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:56.180
And I just don't see that happening.

02:34:56.180 --> 02:34:57.180
They're not gonna.

02:34:57.180 --> 02:34:58.180
Yeah.

02:34:58.180 --> 02:35:01.500
I mean never say never just like Nintendo, herp-a-derp.

02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:06.320
It would be hilarious if they did Saturn games on a PlayStation at all.

02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:09.120
That would just be lol.

02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:11.960
Cause the big competition was the Saturn and PlayStation back in the day.

02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:14.960
Or what about PlayStation games on a Dreamcast?

02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:18.200
That I have three video games that I can play on my Dreamcast.

02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:19.200
That's the joke.

02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:20.200
Was it what?

02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:21.200
It was Tekken and Crazy Taxi.

02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:23.840
Tekken 3 and Crazy Taxi and Metal Gear.

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:24.840
Metal Gear Solid.

02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:25.840
Was it really?

02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:26.840
Yes it was.

02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:27.840
That was all Bleemcast by the way.

02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:28.840
They were Bleemcast.

02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:33.880
I remember when I tried to run Bleem on my PC, granted this was way back in the day and

02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:35.160
that did not work.

02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:39.760
I remember when I had an emulator that worked better than Bleem.

02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:44.080
And we were trying to play Street Fighter EX3.

02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:47.560
That was lolsy cause it still ran like crap.

02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:48.560
But yeah.

02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:51.520
Tekken actually did look a lot better on Dreamcast.

02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:53.040
Just saying.

02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:54.480
That's it.

02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:55.480
Email us.

02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:57.240
Mailbag at OrangelaungeRadio.com.

02:35:57.240 --> 02:35:59.280
Make Dark Sakura work more next week.

02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:00.280
Send us more emails.

02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:02.160
Mailbag at OrangelaungeRadio.com.

02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:06.960
Meanwhile, we do a segment here every week on the show that sometimes has to do with

02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:07.960
video games.

02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:08.960
Sometimes not.

02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:09.960
Why?

02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:10.960
Because we can.

02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:15.960
FUs of the Week!

02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:30.160
FU to everybody who's eating at Wendy's today, Rob.

02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:31.160
Haters gonna hate.

02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:33.000
For not bringing me a Frosty.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.600
Cause I wanted a Frosty all day.

02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:38.160
I didn't get a Frosty, but the berry tea was very good.

02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:39.160
I'm not gonna lie.

02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:41.040
I even told my husband to go get me a Frosty.

02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:42.040
And you know what he did?

02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:44.160
He went across the street and got a hamburger.

02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:46.960
And then he brought me one and I just had a hot dog.

02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:48.680
Oh, from your neighbors that are cooking?

02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:49.680
Yes.

02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:50.680
We're doing our barbecue tomorrow.

02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:53.920
You did tell the neighbors it's July 3rd, right?

02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:56.680
No one cur.

02:36:56.680 --> 02:36:58.560
FU to Wendy's for sucking.

02:36:58.560 --> 02:36:59.560
Hey.

02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:01.560
Cause they have terrible food.

02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:08.760
Somebody sent me a coupon for free Frosty since you gave Rob a Civ beta thing.

02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:11.760
One of them is game related, the other is not.

02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:12.760
Don't care.

02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:13.760
I want a Frosty.

02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:14.760
Frosty's the best thing ever.

02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:18.000
Do you know what Miek Latov tried to convince me was a good idea once?

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.480
Dipping your french fries into your Frosty?

02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:21.960
No, dipping chicken McNuggets into Frosty.

02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:22.960
Gross.

02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:23.960
The Wendy's don't have McNuggets.

02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:24.960
There's people that love that.

02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:25.960
You know what I mean?

02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:26.960
Like chocolate shakes.

02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:27.960
And Rob?

02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:28.960
What?

02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:29.960
It's gross.

02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:34.400
I was gonna say Miek Latov, hey, I don't know if he's still working, no you don't still

02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:35.400
work in Gamestop.

02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:37.800
No, he definitely does not work in Gamestop.

02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:44.520
I need the DLC for Earth Defense Force, I need to pick up that pre-order shit somewhere.

02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:45.520
Ask the listeners.

02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:48.640
Someone sent me the DLC for Earth Defense Force.

02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:49.880
And you will give them?

02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:50.880
Nothing.

02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:51.880
A high-five.

02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:52.880
A handshake.

02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:53.880
Can't even do that.

02:37:53.880 --> 02:38:04.360
Alright, my F.U. of the week goes to, this is a work-related F.U. because I don't want

02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:06.520
people thinking it has to do with other things.

02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:07.520
It's work-related.

02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:11.160
F.U. to surprises.

02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:12.160
Work-related surprises.

02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:15.480
Alright, that's really it.

02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:18.000
Otherwise things are actually pretty good.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Let's move on.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Yeah.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:27.360
So, this is kind of neat, I mean, unexpected, I guess, because life goes on, I guess.

02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:31.800
But, Tokyo Game Show's gonna have a pretty good showing this year.

02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:38.200
They're up to 146 exhibitors over the 138 in 2010, and of course people are like, ah,

02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:43.120
you know, earthquake, and old developers, ah, they, you know, suffered from it.

02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:49.480
I mean, it's been, it's gonna be a while, and you know what, life does go on, you know,

02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:54.880
so it's gonna be up, they're expecting to see, I guess, or they're gonna try to reduce

02:38:54.880 --> 02:38:58.200
the power usage during the show.

02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:05.520
They're gonna drop it down 25% versus 2010 as well, and, but overall it's gonna have

02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:07.960
a really good showing.

02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:12.320
So it's pretty cool.

02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:16.540
That's great that it seems like it's gonna be such a big, big show, and just, it's great

02:39:16.540 --> 02:39:19.800
that they're kind of bouncing with all that recovery stuff, so I'm very happy to hear

02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:21.360
it, actually.

02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:24.120
So there you go.

02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:30.000
Moving on to one last story here about music, music-related stuff.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.680
First off, if you didn't already know about this, I imagine most of you listeners already

02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:38.320
have downloaded this and put them on their iPods, but if you are the one that has not,

02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:45.160
more Portal 2 free music is now available, volume 2 of the Songs to Test by, 18 new tracks,

02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:48.280
14 ringtones for your iPhone and Android devices.

02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:50.280
I had no idea that there were ringtones in there.

02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:52.680
I need to look more carefully at this stuff.

02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:53.680
You can check that out.

02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:59.360
New songs include Bring Your Daughter to Work Day, I Am Not a Moron, and Potatoes Lament.

02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:00.620
Which is actually really cool.

02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:04.040
You can also have the orange or blue Portal sound as your messaging ringtone.

02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:05.040
So like, I would love...

02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:06.040
Unless you have an iPhone.

02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:07.040
Don't you wanna have your...

02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:08.040
Oh, really?

02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:09.040
It doesn't work on iPhone?

02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:10.480
Because you can't change your iPhone sounds for your messages.

02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:11.480
That's why I didn't notice it.

02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:12.480
Yes, you can.

02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:13.480
You can.

02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:14.480
For messages?

02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:15.480
For messages?

02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:17.760
Only for the ones that they put on your phone.

02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:18.760
Oh, yeah.

02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:20.760
Yeah, that's true.

02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:21.760
Yeah.

02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:25.520
Volume 3 is coming soon.

02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:26.520
How soon?

02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:28.880
I said soon.

02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:33.320
Also in music-related news, another Rockman Arrange album, of course you know that, here's

02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:42.480
Mega Man, Rockman Unity announced a new Rockman Arrange soundtrack.

02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:46.440
We Are Rockman is the...Rockman, excuse me, is the podcast.

02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:54.680
It includes Mashihiro Aoki on guitar, Yasumasa Kitagawa on bass.

02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:57.520
He did work on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom All-Stars.

02:40:57.520 --> 02:41:04.920
Mitsuhiko Bleep Bleep Boop Bloop Maestro Takano on drums, and there will be some guest musicians

02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:05.920
as well.

02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:09.400
Otherwise, we don't have a lot of details about the album, but basically Capcom's greats

02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:12.360
are getting together to do some Rockman Arrange music.

02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:13.360
Gotta be cool.

02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:16.280
That kind of sounds like what the Black Mages did for Final Fantasy.

02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:17.960
That's kind of what that sounds like to me.

02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:19.760
So there you go.

02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:22.160
Alright, that does it for gaming news tonight.

02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:23.280
We're done.

02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:24.280
We're out of here.

02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:26.720
But not until we open up the Skype line and take some calls.

02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:29.440
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.

02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:31.800
Give us a call and you can talk with us.

02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:34.680
We can talk about any of the stories we talked about tonight, or maybe we missed something

02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:36.280
that you wanted to talk about.

02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:40.240
Do you want to talk about Nintendo and the localization, or maybe you want to talk more

02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:44.160
about, I don't know, Minecraft or Gears of War 3 leaking, whatever you want to talk about,

02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:45.160
give us a call.

02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:49.400
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.

02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:52.800
In the meantime, you know I'm going to ask Loki if there's any last minute stories.

02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:58.480
So apparently, because to celebrate Independence Day, you can now dress up your avatar on Xbox

02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:00.760
360 as a Confederate soldier.

02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:01.760
Awesome.

02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:03.760
Oh boy.

02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:06.440
Go south.

02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:10.160
I don't know, that's kind of weird.

02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:14.440
Not at all a bad thing.

02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:19.760
What do you mean that they, oh, but ok, it's just like you do the right combination of

02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:20.760
hats and gear.

02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:24.440
No, they have Civil War uniform, 160 Microsoft points.

02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:25.440
Really?

02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:26.440
Interesting.

02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:29.480
I mean, but you could do also, you know, the other stuff.

02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:36.000
They have also, you know, some funny hats, because everyone loves funny hats.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.400
I love funny hats.

02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:42.960
It'd just be weird though, like, since a lot of that DLC doesn't translate over though

02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:47.640
into games, it would still be funny like playing, you know, seeing it or something like that

02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:51.680
with a civil, you know, a Confederate soldier or something.

02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:54.120
Anything else in last minute news tonight?

02:42:54.120 --> 02:42:55.120
Uhhhhh.

02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:59.680
Earth Defense Force is awesome.

02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:01.960
I actually watched you playing that a little bit over there.

02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:03.240
It's really hard.

02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:06.160
It seriously, and I'm only playing it easy.

02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:11.160
Apparently if you play the harder difficulties, you can turn your AI bots off.

02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:12.480
I don't even want to know.

02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:16.760
It's just, and then once you beat the game, they also have campaign remix where you can

02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:19.800
play with different enemies spawning.

02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:22.080
So it's got a lot of gameplay built in there.

02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:27.040
I'm sorry if I'm just ranting about this game, but it's just, it's worth picking up.

02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:29.640
You are a little bit, but it's fine.

02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:30.640
We all knew this would happen.

02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:32.680
You've been talking about this game for like a year.

02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:33.680
Exactly.

02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:35.400
Just you wait until Saints Row 3 comes out.

02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:39.320
I mean, you think this is bad, oh no, not even close.

02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:42.400
I actually kind of want to be there when you're playing Saints Row 3 for the first time.

02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:43.400
It is gonna be just...

02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:47.280
Like, I don't know how I can do that, but I need, we need to have a Saints Row 3 party.

02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:48.520
It's gonna be fucking nuts.

02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:50.280
Okay, so here's something we can talk about.

02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:53.480
You can stream it on the internet except, oh shit, we would be breaking the law.

02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:56.960
1877 Game O.L.R., username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:59.200
Bunchy Aerospace was finally announced what that is.

02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:03.400
It's a partnership program with social and mobile devs where they're basically gonna

02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:13.260
help either publish, promote, or, you know, draw interest for different games that are

02:44:13.260 --> 02:44:16.960
coming out on these platforms where they may not get as much interest.

02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:18.280
So that's kind of cool.

02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:24.040
Unfortunately, they will not be building spaceships as not part of the aerospace program.

02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:25.040
Let's go to the phones.

02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:26.040
We have a call.

02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:27.040
1877 Game O.L.R.

02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:28.040
after this is done.

02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:29.040
Hi, OrangeLawnsRadio.

02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:30.040
Who's this?

02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:31.040
Hi.

02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:32.040
Pleasure, Zaku here.

02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:33.040
Hi, Zaku.

02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:36.480
I'm just trying to recover before tomorrow and everything.

02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:38.680
Well tomorrow is when the real parties are supposed to happen.

02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:39.680
What not?

02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:40.680
What?

02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:42.680
Tomorrow is when the real parties are supposed to happen.

02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:44.080
I don't know.

02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:46.160
Just like a barbecue at my place at home.

02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:47.160
Oh, okay.

02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:50.320
That and trying to go out with this girl tomorrow.

02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:51.320
Well I hope he gets some.

02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:52.320
What's on your mind tonight?

02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:53.880
Uh, nothing much.

02:44:53.880 --> 02:45:01.920
Just like trying to lament over the fallout of, you know, what transpired last week with

02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:07.800
the whole Supreme Court decision, which I know you probably covered in great detail

02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:09.160
before this call.

02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:11.700
We did, but what are your thoughts?

02:45:11.700 --> 02:45:12.700
I don't know.

02:45:12.700 --> 02:45:17.640
On one hand, it's like they're grasping at straws and trying to legislate something that's

02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:21.720
already been declared protected speech for all intents and purposes.

02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:28.600
So it's like the people who were, you know, the ones who pushed the, you know, the particular

02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:33.480
person that pushed the law and, you know, and actually got the law, you know, introduced

02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:39.920
the law and got it passed, well he's, he's, he's basically not giving up in that sense.

02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:45.120
He thinks he can wrangle his way through the constitution when it's pretty clear, even,

02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:48.920
you know, it's pretty clear that, you know, when you ban something like this, that's no

02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:52.960
matter, no matter if you put lipstick on, on that same bill, it's still going to be

02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:56.160
unconstitutional because they've already...

02:45:56.160 --> 02:46:02.080
Well, but what about how there were a couple justices that basically said, you can regulate

02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:03.480
games just not like this.

02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:06.720
That's maybe leaving the door wide open for somebody else.

02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:12.240
I know it's, some have said it's a 5-4 split in reality because two of them concurred with

02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:16.480
the, you know, two of the other justices concurred with Scalia.

02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:17.480
Right.

02:46:17.480 --> 02:46:18.480
Yeah.

02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:22.400
So it's basically, it's like they weren't, they weren't for it, but at the same time

02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:23.920
they were in between.

02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:30.960
So it wasn't like, you know, if you really get, if you really go deep into that decision,

02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:36.200
there's not that much, there's only like a, you know, a thin, you know, a thin margin

02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:39.600
of just prevail, of prevailing opinion.

02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:40.600
What do you think about this?

02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:43.800
Something that's just like, that it barely got through.

02:46:43.800 --> 02:46:46.900
Let me quickly ask you, what'd you think about this other bill we spent some time talking

02:46:46.900 --> 02:46:51.640
about tonight, the whole, you know, no more streaming of movies and games and so forth?

02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:56.960
Oh, that one is, that one right there, that's a landmine.

02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:02.080
I'm pretty sure if it ever comes to court, it's going to, one way or another will know

02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:04.080
what impact it has.

02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:06.680
Right now it's very murky.

02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:09.680
And you're just waiting, and they're just waiting, you know, the feds are just waiting

02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:11.400
to at least use it on something.

02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:16.400
I can't wait for the 12 year old- Some guy just like leaking a trailer on YouTube

02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:20.040
or just posting up a gameplay, gameplay footage.

02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:26.360
And for some reason, you know, some, some video game company, which doesn't, you know,

02:47:26.360 --> 02:47:29.560
which took offense to that whole act, will stick the feds on him.

02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:30.560
Think about it.

02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:35.160
I can't wait for the 10 year old to get sued for posting a YouTube of her singing-

02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:36.160
That's the thing, it's not even sued.

02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:39.600
He's actually, you're going to see federal agents roll up in his house.

02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:45.600
Singing Lady Gaga's Born This Way, when Lady Gaga herself loves that shit and posts about

02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:46.600
it to Twitter.

02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:50.600
There's some 10 year old girl that she invited on stage with her because she loved watching

02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:51.880
her YouTube performance.

02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:55.520
I understand, but guess who owns, still has control of the music.

02:47:55.520 --> 02:48:01.200
No, I get it, but I mean if I- The label, remember, Lady Gaga's only one person that

02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:06.520
until she's met the, until she's already honored the contract with her label, she doesn't own

02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:08.000
her music.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.760
She's a slave, just like Prince was, hence the symbol.

02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:11.760
Exactly.

02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:14.920
And that's the thing, unless you own your master tracks and you can take them anywhere

02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:21.680
else, then you have control of it, otherwise you've already sold your soul to the label

02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:25.360
and they'll be the ones taking the feds on that 10 year old kid.

02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:28.640
All right, any other quick thoughts before we let you go and get another call?

02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:36.120
Yeah, take advantage of these sales right now on the sites of Amazon, Steam in particular.

02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:38.920
Lot of really good stuff to be had right now.

02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:42.560
Great FYI in chat from William Murderface, always love that name.

02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:46.600
Oh, if anyone's looking for a Diablo 2 fix and does not have Torchlight, it's on sale

02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:48.400
for $2.99 on Steam today.

02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:51.520
That's a $3 game, I'm thinking about it right now.

02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:57.120
If you even remotely like Diablo or Diablo 2, you will get $3 worth out of Torchlight.

02:48:57.120 --> 02:49:04.560
But I played that game years ago, all I remember is just mashing my mouse, just click mashing.

02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:09.640
It's very much a dungeon, well here's the great thing, do you have a 360?

02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:12.160
Yes, but I- Go download the demo.

02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:15.960
I want to just do it from my end, I want to keep it old school.

02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:17.880
We can at least download the demo to see what the game's like, all right.

02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:20.840
I gotta let you go to get more calls, take care buddy.

02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:24.680
I think Torchlight's a great deal, but yeah, it's a dungeon crawler, so I don't know if

02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:29.040
you aren't into the dungeon crawlers, you may not like it, but we'll see.

02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:30.920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:33.040
Hey, it's Ronmo, what's up everyone?

02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:35.360
Not much, you know, just hanging.

02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:39.800
Chilling, smoking a little, you know- Doing a show.

02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:42.000
Smoking a J, no I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding, we don't do that.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:45.320
Oh, pass it over this way, man, it's the fourth.

02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:50.400
What's on your mind- Yes, I can think of no better way on spending Independence Day than

02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:57.520
burning various things, including fireworks, our money, and a J.

02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:00.920
I'm not gonna complain, so it works for me.

02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:04.360
Only in America will we celebrate fire, what's on your mind?

02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:09.240
I have this one question, I've been meaning to ask you guys this for long, so I keep forgetting.

02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:10.240
The answer is no.

02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:13.240
God damn it, Ron!

02:50:13.240 --> 02:50:14.880
What's the question, I'm kidding.

02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:21.360
Okay, now back at E3, Konami had announced that they were re-releasing, I believe, Zoner

02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:26.360
the Enders and Silent Hill as the collectors of all the games together?

02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:27.360
Correct.

02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:28.360
Yes.

02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:33.600
Now we had a discussion about that on Twitter, half of us are saying that Konami pretty much

02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:37.480
turned their back on the fans, they're just looking for a quick pop.

02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:42.960
The other half are saying Konami is doing this to garner interest into the series to

02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:46.080
see if it's worth another game.

02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:48.680
What do you think?

02:50:48.680 --> 02:50:51.000
I think it's a little bit of both, to be honest.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:56.480
I think it's, you know, why not make a little more cash on games that were previously out,

02:50:56.480 --> 02:50:59.960
although they are having to re-do them and so forth, you know, they're having to change

02:50:59.960 --> 02:51:07.360
it up a little bit, but if the game sold phenomenally, they would really have no choice but to continue

02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:08.840
the series, you know what I mean?

02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:14.000
Like the Metal Gear selection will sell well no matter what, but, you know, Silent Hill

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:17.560
1 will probably sell alright, although it's really weird that 1 is not involved, but I

02:51:17.560 --> 02:51:20.960
guess it has to do with all the voice acting, I don't know.

02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:26.520
But yeah, you know, I think the games will sell alright, and as far as Konami's motivation,

02:51:26.520 --> 02:51:31.080
I mean, it's hard to say because the whole repackaging thing, you can't like say that

02:51:31.080 --> 02:51:35.140
Konami is the first to do it, so I think they're just jumping on a bandwagon that people have

02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:43.920
shown they want to be on, God of War has already done it, the Ico games and Shadow of the Colossus,

02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:47.620
all that stuff is being read out, you know, so the gaming populace has already shown they'll

02:51:47.620 --> 02:51:51.600
buy it, so you can't really blame Konami for putting it out there.

02:51:51.600 --> 02:51:55.000
And even stuff that's come out recently, like the Prince of Persia trilogy, the Splinter

02:51:55.000 --> 02:52:01.360
Cell trilogy is coming out a little bit later, and Tomb Raider, they already did all those

02:52:01.360 --> 02:52:02.360
as well.

02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:05.200
Okay, I understand that.

02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:10.600
Now do you think maybe time could be also a factor in this compared to like, if the

02:52:10.600 --> 02:52:15.520
games came out within a certain range, and maybe a couple years later they put out the

02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:21.100
collection compared to maybe waiting like five, six years later for a complete collection?

02:52:21.100 --> 02:52:24.920
I'm not sure I follow you, these collections are coming out next year, so...

02:52:24.920 --> 02:52:30.320
I mean like, let's say like, they put out Zoner Yenders 1, 2, and 3 with let's say like

02:52:30.320 --> 02:52:37.680
in 2000, 2001, 2002, and like in 2005 they put out the collectors of all three together.

02:52:37.680 --> 02:52:42.620
Now let's say instead of 2005 they wait like till about now to put them all out, they wait

02:52:42.620 --> 02:52:43.960
like almost ten years.

02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:48.280
But they're gonna upres them and make them more current, you know.

02:52:48.280 --> 02:52:51.480
They're redoing them in HD, so I'm okay with it.

02:52:51.480 --> 02:52:54.480
Let's also be honest, how's this any different from the movie industry?

02:52:54.480 --> 02:52:59.480
You know, the movie industry does this shit all the time and we eat it up, like how many

02:52:59.480 --> 02:53:01.500
times did the Star Wars movies come out?

02:53:01.500 --> 02:53:06.240
And they're coming out again on Blu-ray, and I know tons of people that'll be there right

02:53:06.240 --> 02:53:07.240
when they come out.

02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:10.160
Well, I don't mean to interrupt, Rob, that's because George Lucas turned his back on the

02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:12.560
fans and he's a money-grubbing whore.

02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:15.920
I know that, but the new Star Wars is really awesome.

02:53:15.920 --> 02:53:20.600
But what about like, okay, Harry Potter.

02:53:20.600 --> 02:53:23.900
When those movies come out, they come out on Blu-ray, and then you can get a box set

02:53:23.900 --> 02:53:25.480
with one through five.

02:53:25.480 --> 02:53:28.520
And then when six came out, you buy six, oh and then now it's a box set with one through

02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:32.120
six and maybe some other bonus features, a preview of seven.

02:53:32.120 --> 02:53:33.240
Oh, now seven's out.

02:53:33.240 --> 02:53:36.740
Now there's a box set of one through seven and there'll be a preview for eight.

02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:40.340
And there'll be another box set when eight comes out and it'll have the special features

02:53:40.340 --> 02:53:45.360
online, Uber, God, Poopy Pop, what?

02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:47.280
Book seven was the last one.

02:53:47.280 --> 02:53:48.280
But there was eight movies.

02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:50.040
I'm talking about the movies.

02:53:50.040 --> 02:53:53.040
I know, book seven was two movies, but I see your point.

02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:55.160
I was just trying to be an ass.

02:53:55.160 --> 02:53:56.160
You're trying to be an ass.

02:53:56.160 --> 02:53:57.160
Wait, wait, wait, now hold on a second.

02:53:57.160 --> 02:54:02.280
Is not, is not this new movie the eighth movie coming out?

02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:07.000
I understand it's two parts, but it is, in the line of movies, the eighth movie.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:08.000
Yeah.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:09.000
Yeah, yes.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:10.000
It is the eighth movie.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:11.000
It is.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:14.480
Watch Warner Brothers release both movies together as movie seven.

02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:17.040
Just the fuck with you.

02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:18.040
It's just like Twilight.

02:54:18.040 --> 02:54:20.040
Aren't they splitting the last one into twos?

02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:21.040
There's five movies.

02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:22.040
Yeah.

02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:24.160
As if it hasn't drug out long enough already.

02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:26.400
Let's put the last one in the two.

02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:31.680
DJ Morin, DJ Morpheus in our chat room says, actually Lord of the Rings is the biggest

02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:33.320
DVD horror.

02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:34.360
That's yeah.

02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:37.540
Now Blu-ray horror because the super extended editions, yes.

02:54:37.540 --> 02:54:42.120
As if that movie wasn't long enough and theatrical re-release bullshit, which I don't give a

02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:45.480
shit about and I won't go see, I wouldn't mind going to see it.

02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:49.040
I know, you know, it's, I don't know if I should admit this.

02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:51.600
I never saw the third movie.

02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:54.800
I saw, I saw the first two opening day nonetheless.

02:54:54.800 --> 02:54:55.800
I never saw it.

02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:56.800
For me.

02:54:56.800 --> 02:55:03.160
And people are going to go, oh, you're a hater, but the whole point is that I read the books.

02:55:03.160 --> 02:55:06.280
The movies were good.

02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:10.160
I'm more interested in the Hobbit coming out because I like the Hobbit better than I liked

02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:11.160
the other books.

02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:12.280
I can't believe you read those books.

02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:13.320
I've tried to read those books.

02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:16.440
I can't like, I'm like, speak a language I can read.

02:55:16.440 --> 02:55:18.440
Tolkien was so fucking boring.

02:55:18.440 --> 02:55:24.400
It's a good story, but my God, we don't need that much description of the grass.

02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:26.440
Rama, I got to let you go and get more calls.

02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:30.920
Rob, before I go, I just want to say in response to Twilight, I love that picture you posted

02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:32.800
on your Tumblr.

02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:38.840
The one of the stakes on the fence that says in case of sparkly vampires or break off in

02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:39.840
case of sparkly vampires.

02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:40.840
Right.

02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:43.680
And I think I posted it and I put, how about screaming fangirls too?

02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:44.680
Yes.

02:55:44.680 --> 02:55:47.760
And before I go, I'm going to say, I dedicate this picture to you that I put on my blog

02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:48.760
post.

02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:50.200
I just posted it in the chat.

02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:51.200
All right.

02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:52.200
You got it.

02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:53.200
All right.

02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:54.200
Later.

02:55:54.200 --> 02:56:00.000
Sorry for the awkward silence there.

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.880
I was typing an important message because there's a YouTube I want to find real quick

02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:03.880
there.

02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:04.880
So I'm trying to find it there.

02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:06.600
Let me look at what Rama posted to his Tumblr.

02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:07.600
Hold on one sec.

02:56:07.600 --> 02:56:08.600
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:13.960
And I'm following the link and let's see.

02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:15.120
I love that.

02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:17.920
It's haters going to hate, but it's Frankenfurter from the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:20.080
You see this dark Sakura?

02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:21.080
That's awesome.

02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:22.080
Okay.

02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:23.160
You need to put that on Tumblr so I can reblog it.

02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:24.160
It's on Rama's Tumblr.

02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:25.160
Okay.

02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:26.160
Then I'll reblog it.

02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:27.160
If you follow him.

02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:28.160
What's up with...

02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:29.160
Now it's Tumblr.

02:56:29.160 --> 02:56:32.920
There was LiveJournal, which I'm a permanent member of, so I always have to love LiveJournal

02:56:32.920 --> 02:56:34.360
forever and ever.

02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:36.080
There's Facebook.

02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:38.440
There's Myspace back in the day.

02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:39.440
Friendster shit.

02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:40.440
Twitter.

02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:41.440
And now it's fucking Tumblr.

02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:42.440
I never used Friendster.

02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:43.440
I never used it.

02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:44.440
Really?

02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:46.080
How did you avoid that?

02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:47.080
It was...

02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:50.040
I love my LiveJournal so much.

02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:51.040
That was me.

02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:52.040
All right.

02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:53.040
Take one more call real quick and then we're going to wrap up the show.

02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:54.040
Let's go to our own Orange Pots Radio.

02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:55.040
Hey, it's Blender.

02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:56.040
Blender!

02:56:56.040 --> 02:56:57.520
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:56:57.520 --> 02:56:58.880
Nothing.

02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:03.960
You know, I kind of wanted to go back to this whole class action lawsuit that you guys were

02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:07.100
talking about with these online games.

02:57:07.100 --> 02:57:09.000
These Star Wars Galaxies?

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Yeah.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:11.000
Yeah.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:12.000
What's up?

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:17.480
I think eventually somebody's going to find a loophole and actually get in on this.

02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:18.880
I know you guys...

02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:21.640
A couple of you guys are into Disney and all that.

02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:25.160
Do you remember the Virtual Magic Kingdom game?

02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:26.760
I don't know if you ever heard of it.

02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:29.800
I remember the NES game Adventures in the Magic,

02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:31.400
oh wait, no, no, no, online.

02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:33.520
No, no, it was the online MMO.

02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:34.360
I don't think I ever played it.

02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:37.420
That they put out for the 50 year anniversary.

02:57:37.420 --> 02:57:38.920
You know what, I know I'm familiar

02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:40.240
with some of the Disney MMOs.

02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:42.800
I know Club Penguin and I know that they're infamous

02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:44.040
for not letting you type.

02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:47.840
You can only select from select phrases.

02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:50.160
Well, no, no, no, well what they did is

02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:54.440
for the 50 year anniversary, they created an MMO,

02:57:54.440 --> 02:57:57.640
which was, it was a free walk through Disneyland Park

02:57:57.640 --> 02:58:00.400
and you can create friends and meet people.

02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:02.040
And it really messed up some people

02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:03.360
when they closed that site down.

02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:05.800
In fact, I got a link.

02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:07.760
I don't know if it's gonna post, but.

02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:10.080
Rob, Peter was telling us about that

02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:10.960
when we were at the park.

02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:11.920
I don't know, I just.

02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:14.720
Because I have a pen from it.

02:58:14.720 --> 02:58:16.960
Oh, that's right, that I do remember.

02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:17.800
Yeah. Yes, I do.

02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:20.800
Yeah, I have one of the links that I just picked.

02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:22.440
It was from joystick.com

02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:24.480
is when they closed the actual site.

02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:27.680
And you know, it was really devastating

02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:30.440
because I was actually on it for like two years.

02:58:30.440 --> 02:58:35.440
And it just, it killed a lot of kids.

02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:39.280
There was like 10, 11 year old kids that could,

02:58:39.280 --> 02:58:42.680
or even younger that couldn't play this game anymore.

02:58:42.680 --> 02:58:46.080
And I really think that somebody's gonna find a loophole

02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:48.960
with closing down these large MMOs

02:58:48.960 --> 02:58:51.360
that they're gonna, you know,

02:58:51.360 --> 02:58:53.960
find a psychological way to get out of this.

02:58:53.960 --> 02:58:56.120
They can always, it's weird though

02:58:56.120 --> 02:58:59.000
that a company should be like locked into doing it.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:00.800
You know, like, I'm not sure I agree with that,

02:59:00.800 --> 02:59:03.400
but I think the nice thing, quote unquote, to do,

02:59:03.400 --> 02:59:06.160
if you're gonna pull support for your game altogether

02:59:06.160 --> 02:59:08.360
is to go the Phantasy Star route.

02:59:08.360 --> 02:59:10.080
And when they closed up Blue Burst,

02:59:10.080 --> 02:59:13.720
they just said, here, open up your own damn servers.

02:59:13.720 --> 02:59:15.120
And if you wanna copy your characters over,

02:59:15.120 --> 02:59:16.240
here's how you do it.

02:59:16.240 --> 02:59:17.360
Like, isn't that right?

02:59:17.360 --> 02:59:18.800
Dark Soccer, you followed this better than I did,

02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:20.520
but Blue Burst, when they went under,

02:59:20.520 --> 02:59:21.760
Sega was very much like-

02:59:21.760 --> 02:59:24.760
Sega was like, here's your character data

02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:27.280
and you can transfer it to the server of your choice.

02:59:27.280 --> 02:59:29.880
Yeah, but you're in an interesting position

02:59:29.880 --> 02:59:34.480
with Star Wars Galaxies because they probably just don't,

02:59:34.480 --> 02:59:37.320
they want those people playing the BioWare Star Wars game

02:59:37.320 --> 02:59:38.240
that's coming out.

02:59:39.200 --> 02:59:40.960
They don't want them on the old game.

02:59:40.960 --> 02:59:44.120
They don't wanna split the fan base like EverQuest did.

02:59:44.120 --> 02:59:46.760
A lot of people look at what EverQuest did

02:59:46.760 --> 02:59:49.880
and say, oh boy, that was a mistake.

02:59:49.880 --> 02:59:51.720
They should have never put out EverQuest 2

02:59:51.720 --> 02:59:54.320
because people were still tied to EverQuest 1

02:59:54.320 --> 02:59:55.160
and didn't wanna play it

02:59:55.160 --> 02:59:56.560
and then it split their fan base.

02:59:56.560 --> 02:59:59.480
That's why there will never be a World of Warcraft 2.

02:59:59.480 --> 03:00:02.920
There will never be a World of Warcraft 2.

03:00:02.920 --> 03:00:05.440
The closest thing you get are these expansions

03:00:05.440 --> 03:00:10.080
such as Cataclysm that changed Warcraft so drastically,

03:00:10.080 --> 03:00:11.560
it's almost like a sequel.

03:00:11.560 --> 03:00:16.560
So the way you're talking about it is breaking it up

03:00:16.880 --> 03:00:21.480
instead of like, for example, Virtual Magic Kingdom

03:00:21.480 --> 03:00:24.480
where they closed it down totally.

03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:25.840
They should have gone open source

03:00:25.840 --> 03:00:28.280
so somebody who loved it could have kept it going

03:00:28.280 --> 03:00:30.920
but how can you force a company to do that?

03:00:32.080 --> 03:00:32.920
Yeah.

03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:33.760
You can't.

03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:36.600
And it's so funny because we were,

03:00:36.600 --> 03:00:38.120
I had a bunch of friends on there

03:00:38.120 --> 03:00:41.680
and we were on there for, oh, we'd go on there every day.

03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:46.680
And the thing was, the kids that were on this actual site

03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:50.520
weren't allowed to actually give out emails

03:00:50.520 --> 03:00:52.360
and communicate with each other.

03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:55.880
They were only allowed to talk on this Virtual Magic Kingdom

03:00:56.840 --> 03:01:00.280
You weren't allowed to give any personal information away.

03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:01.600
Right, right, because you were very restricted

03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:02.440
to what you could say.

03:01:02.440 --> 03:01:04.320
All of a sudden they said in a month from now,

03:01:04.320 --> 03:01:08.240
we're closing the site and it's done, that's it.

03:01:08.240 --> 03:01:10.000
And you should just,

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:13.600
God, it just killed a bunch of these little kids, you know.

03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:16.440
It's sad, but at the same time,

03:01:16.440 --> 03:01:18.160
how can you force a company to keep something going

03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:19.360
that's not making them any money?

03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:20.640
Hey. Right, right.

03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:21.480
There's a-

03:01:21.480 --> 03:01:23.160
If the miniature golf place closes down,

03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:24.480
what can you do about it?

03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:25.320
Yeah.

03:01:25.320 --> 03:01:28.800
Someone's actually made a quote replacement

03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:31.720
called Virtual Family Kingdom.

03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:33.280
Oh no, no, yeah, I've seen that one.

03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:36.480
It was actually a lot, everybody jumped over to that.

03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:39.920
That was sponsored by the Smithsonian Kingdom

03:01:39.920 --> 03:01:42.720
or Smithsonian Institute.

03:01:42.720 --> 03:01:43.560
Interesting.

03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:45.560
But it was just, it was horrible.

03:01:45.560 --> 03:01:47.480
I mean, we went over to that.

03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:52.480
But I don't know if you guys saw the post that I put,

03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:54.800
like you should see some of the stories that were,

03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:58.760
there was actually people protesting in front of Disneyland

03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:00.080
the day that it closed down.

03:02:00.080 --> 03:02:00.920
Wow.

03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:01.760
Because they were so upset.

03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:02.880
Wow.

03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:03.720
Yeah.

03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:06.160
Well, maybe they'll be protesting on Starbucks.

03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:10.000
The only thing that ties in with the class action lawsuit

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:11.520
that you guys were talking about

03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:13.280
is I think that somebody's gonna find

03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:16.200
a psychological loophole that's gonna say,

03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:19.600
you close down this site that I've spent so much time into,

03:02:21.480 --> 03:02:23.120
I'm gonna be able to get some money out of it.

03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:23.960
I don't know.

03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:25.640
I still think the terms of service

03:02:25.640 --> 03:02:28.960
are gonna ultimately let the companies come out ahead.

03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:29.800
But we'll see.

03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:30.640
All right, we'll see.

03:02:30.640 --> 03:02:31.480
I gotta let you go, buddy, so you wrap up the show.

03:02:31.480 --> 03:02:32.320
All right, thank you, thank you.

03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:33.200
Thank you for your call.

03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:34.480
Appreciate it.

03:02:34.480 --> 03:02:35.320
It was a good topic.

03:02:35.320 --> 03:02:36.440
I like that.

03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:38.040
Blender, live on OLR.

03:02:38.040 --> 03:02:39.120
We're gonna show off the Skype line.

03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:40.200
Sorry to you guys who didn't get through

03:02:40.200 --> 03:02:41.240
on the Skype line tonight.

03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:43.000
But if you wanna send us an email with your thoughts,

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:44.560
mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com,

03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:47.160
or of course you can always tweet us, twitter.com slash OLR.

03:02:47.160 --> 03:02:48.400
By the way, I found this,

03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:51.760
you know, DJ Rama was talking about Twilight

03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:53.600
and how much he doesn't really like Twilight,

03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:55.040
but yet, I don't know you guys.

03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:56.320
I got sent this YouTube,

03:02:56.320 --> 03:02:58.920
and this is a YouTube of DJ Rama S

03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:02.200
actually watching the Breaking Dawn trailer.

03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:03.480
And let's see.

03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:05.480
Let's see how Rama actually reacted

03:03:05.480 --> 03:03:07.000
to seeing this trailer the first time.

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:08.560
Cool.

03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:10.160
Fucking massive boobs.

03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:12.280
Shh.

03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:15.640
Ah.

03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:17.760
Ah.

03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:23.400
Oh my God, I'm still living in mine.

03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:24.240
No.

03:03:26.400 --> 03:03:28.240
God, Rama, you're getting really upset over this.

03:03:28.240 --> 03:03:29.160
I'm so sad.

03:03:29.160 --> 03:03:30.000
No.

03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:32.720
No.

03:03:33.720 --> 03:03:35.040
Don't get naked.

03:03:36.040 --> 03:03:37.240
Don't get naked, Rama.

03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:38.920
You were the one talking about vagina

03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:40.760
in the chat room earlier.

03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:41.600
No.

03:03:44.400 --> 03:03:45.840
Stop it.

03:03:45.840 --> 03:03:47.080
All right, let me tell you what this really is.

03:03:47.080 --> 03:03:49.080
This is some chick.

03:03:49.080 --> 03:03:50.680
So let me just pop, show me this video.

03:03:50.680 --> 03:03:52.320
It goes on for seven and a half minutes.

03:03:52.320 --> 03:03:55.320
It's a trailer reaction video to this chick.

03:03:55.320 --> 03:03:57.680
And I guess what she did, what is this?

03:03:57.680 --> 03:04:00.240
She was internet famous for starting

03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:03.400
the Fuck Stephen King movement when, I guess,

03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:04.960
Stephen King knocked the Twilight series

03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:06.160
and said it was badly written.

03:04:06.160 --> 03:04:07.440
And that's a video of her watching

03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:09.480
the Breaking Dawn trailer for the first time.

03:04:09.480 --> 03:04:11.800
Well, it was badly written.

03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:15.240
I tried to read a page of that.

03:04:15.240 --> 03:04:18.000
And I was like, who let this woman write?

03:04:19.880 --> 03:04:23.360
There should be a class action lawsuit against Bic

03:04:23.360 --> 03:04:25.040
for selling that woman a pen.

03:04:25.040 --> 03:04:25.880
All right.

03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:30.920
She's, I blame her for being Mormon.

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:35.800
I love DJ Morpheus in chat.

03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:37.240
That's just cold, Rob.

03:04:37.240 --> 03:04:39.920
That's coming from Travis of all people.

03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:43.640
Dude, that's just cold.

03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:46.000
All right, that's gonna do it for another week

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:46.840
Orange on Trail.

03:04:46.840 --> 03:04:48.240
Or do we have any other last minute news?

03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:49.080
Did I miss anything?

03:04:49.080 --> 03:04:50.240
I think we got it.

03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:51.240
Just real quick stuff.

03:04:51.240 --> 03:04:53.160
I'm alive.

03:04:53.160 --> 03:04:54.600
Supposed to be coming out still.

03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:56.920
But because the classifications are found

03:04:56.920 --> 03:04:57.760
on the Australian website

03:04:57.760 --> 03:04:59.200
and Crisis is supposed to be coming

03:04:59.200 --> 03:05:01.080
to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

03:05:02.320 --> 03:05:03.440
Cause it is on the SRB.

03:05:04.400 --> 03:05:05.240
All right.

03:05:05.240 --> 03:05:07.560
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:08.560
Before we get the final thoughts,

03:05:08.560 --> 03:05:09.440
I wanna thank you once again

03:05:09.440 --> 03:05:10.520
for listening to Orange on Trail

03:05:10.520 --> 03:05:13.360
and supporting us over these nine years of our program.

03:05:13.360 --> 03:05:15.200
Of course, we're here to do it every Sunday night.

03:05:15.200 --> 03:05:17.280
So if you've never just come out for a live show,

03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:18.120
it's a bummer.

03:05:18.120 --> 03:05:18.960
Tonight would have been a great night

03:05:18.960 --> 03:05:20.960
cause many folks out there don't work on Monday.

03:05:20.960 --> 03:05:23.560
But you know, if you have the time in the future,

03:05:23.560 --> 03:05:25.240
please do consider joining us for a live show.

03:05:25.240 --> 03:05:26.680
We do tape live at All Games Radio,

03:05:26.680 --> 03:05:27.840
allgames.com.

03:05:27.840 --> 03:05:30.040
Sunday nights at six Pacific, nine Eastern,

03:05:30.040 --> 03:05:30.880
right after the Bobby Blackwood show.

03:05:30.880 --> 03:05:32.160
You always say specific.

03:05:32.160 --> 03:05:33.680
Specific, six Pacific.

03:05:33.680 --> 03:05:35.920
It's cause they all kind of run together.

03:05:35.920 --> 03:05:38.000
I talk too fast for radio.

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:38.840
You know what?

03:05:38.840 --> 03:05:39.680
That's why I'm stuck here.

03:05:39.680 --> 03:05:40.500
You know what?

03:05:40.500 --> 03:05:41.340
What?

03:05:41.340 --> 03:05:42.960
It also goes along with like one of my pet peeves

03:05:42.960 --> 03:05:43.800
and songs.

03:05:43.800 --> 03:05:46.280
So people instead of saying, don't you say, don't you?

03:05:46.280 --> 03:05:49.520
Oh, don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?

03:05:49.520 --> 03:05:52.720
I was like, you, not chew.

03:05:52.720 --> 03:05:55.240
Chew is a sound that mice make in Japan.

03:05:55.240 --> 03:05:58.280
Chew is a sound that what's-her-name makes

03:05:58.280 --> 03:05:59.520
in Space Channel Five.

03:05:59.520 --> 03:06:00.360
La la.

03:06:00.360 --> 03:06:01.440
Because it's chew.

03:06:01.440 --> 03:06:02.280
Ooh la la.

03:06:02.280 --> 03:06:03.100
Ooh la la.

03:06:03.100 --> 03:06:04.880
You know, actually Space Channel Five part two

03:06:04.880 --> 03:06:06.960
is on Steam for six bucks.

03:06:06.960 --> 03:06:07.780
Oh, nice.

03:06:07.780 --> 03:06:08.620
Yeah.

03:06:08.620 --> 03:06:10.040
I already have like two copies of it.

03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:10.920
Very nice.

03:06:10.920 --> 03:06:12.000
Lots of good stuff to buy on Steam.

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:13.120
I tell you, BitTrip Runner,

03:06:13.120 --> 03:06:16.080
if it's still $2 and 50 cents is a great buy.

03:06:16.080 --> 03:06:17.920
Anyhow, that's gonna do it for another episode

03:06:17.920 --> 03:06:18.760
of Orange House Radio.

03:06:18.760 --> 03:06:19.580
Please help spread the word.

03:06:19.580 --> 03:06:20.760
Da da da da da.

03:06:20.760 --> 03:06:22.800
OrangeHouseRadio.com, join our website,

03:06:22.800 --> 03:06:24.280
check the forums, all that good stuff.

03:06:24.280 --> 03:06:25.940
We really need to get the activity on the forums again.

03:06:25.940 --> 03:06:28.820
I gotta really think about how we can get those going.

03:06:28.820 --> 03:06:30.440
But meanwhile, let's go around

03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:32.040
and get everybody's final thought for tonight.

03:06:32.040 --> 03:06:32.920
So, Loki, we'll start with you.

03:06:32.920 --> 03:06:34.520
What's your final thought tonight?

03:06:34.520 --> 03:06:35.840
I need to work in some more

03:06:35.840 --> 03:06:39.160
Earth Defense Force this weekend.

03:06:39.160 --> 03:06:41.680
Got to play it for a few hours last night.

03:06:41.680 --> 03:06:43.320
Really need to play more of that.

03:06:44.600 --> 03:06:46.440
My final thought of the night is, you know what?

03:06:46.440 --> 03:06:48.720
Vanilla and Hope, they aren't that bad.

03:06:48.720 --> 03:06:52.220
Like 30 hours later, they aren't that bad.

03:06:52.220 --> 03:06:54.520
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

03:06:54.520 --> 03:06:55.620
Lesbians.

03:06:57.360 --> 03:06:58.200
Fuck yeah.

03:06:59.360 --> 03:07:01.080
I just looked at Alan's Twitter.

03:07:01.080 --> 03:07:02.800
I mean, Tumblr.

03:07:02.800 --> 03:07:04.760
Wait, what's Alan tweeting about lesbians for?

03:07:04.760 --> 03:07:05.640
This is his picture.

03:07:05.640 --> 03:07:07.440
Oh, and don't buy, my other final thought,

03:07:07.440 --> 03:07:09.760
don't buy your games from eBay.

03:07:09.760 --> 03:07:11.800
Unless they're, well, I guess the used market's okay,

03:07:11.800 --> 03:07:12.840
but just be careful.

03:07:12.840 --> 03:07:14.680
Be a buyer beware on eBay.

03:07:14.680 --> 03:07:15.520
All right, that's-

03:07:15.520 --> 03:07:17.340
Just look at the feedback before you buy.

03:07:17.340 --> 03:07:18.760
That's it, guys, have a wonderful night.

03:07:18.760 --> 03:07:21.020
