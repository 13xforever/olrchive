Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody on the internet
and welcome back to the show where every gamer has a voice
Orange Lounge Radio
We are live on this July 10th, 2011
for the 419th episode of our show
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts
First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
I want cake
Get in line
I had ice cream cake yesterday, it was delish
So did I
I know
And it had princesses on it
Yes, Salacious Pop had a birthday yesterday
and mine was a couple of weeks ago as you might recall
but we did like a joint birthday thing
more closer to his birthday, I'm sorry
His birthday was two days ago but the party was yesterday
and so we had a joint cake
It's one of our friends' bot and it's one of those snarky friends
that's, you know, funny, bitchy funny
and got a cake that said Happy Birthday Princesses with the two Mickey and Minnie Mouse on it
But it was cute and I ate some of the sand part
And I was just very happy because we just didn't want chocolate
because you might remember on OLR a few weeks ago
I got a chocolate cake, which was great, I loved it, don't get me wrong
Then I went to work, and I had a chocolate cake at work from co-workers
and I'm like, oh yay, more chocolate
But I bet Becky's cake was better
Becky's cake was better because hers
you could tell the difference between homemade and store-bought
So I mean, I appreciated the cake at work, don't get me wrong
But, you know, I think the Becky cake was a little more from the heart
if you will, rather than from the grocery store
Anyhow, let's go over to the third co-host on our show
here with us as he's been every single week since episode one
with few minor exceptions like when kids are born
Loki!
Hi
Hi, how are you tonight, Loki?
I'm a little sick, but I'm alright
You're sick? You better not get me sick, I'm gonna kick your butt
Hey, I've been doing everything possible not to get anybody else sick
I'm gonna wash my hands like crazy, and that's pretty much it
That's okay, I've got a bucket of Lysol I could dump on him
You might need to do that, because I really can't get sick
Speaking of work, I have a lot going on at work, I cannot get sick
It's not bad, it's just congestion, that's it
It's not like I'm throwing up or something
It's just like, it could very well be allergies, but it's not
And it all started with one damn sneeze
I sneezed, and then all of a sudden I'm like, ugh, and I'm sick
It's like an avalanche
It's like sneeze plague
It's like when my nose started feeling like burning after that
I'm like, ugh, I hate you
Yeah, I had this weird thing going on where the top of my throat was getting all scratchy
a couple weeks ago, or no, not a couple weeks ago, it was more like last week
and I was like, oh crap, this is me starting to get sick
I started taking the emergency and the other vitamins, like loading my body with sea and zinc
just to try and fend it off, and I guess it worked
Shooting up with steroids
I didn't go that far, come on, I'm not Arnold Schwarzenegger
Anyhow, let's talk about video games as we get into another week here at OLR
where we talk about the gaming news, invite you guys to call us
and of course join us in chat at chat.orangelandrader.com
Speaking of the chat
What's that?
I asked Azure Edge, who said, I love bronies
Is that like brownies for bros?
Is that the My Little Brony thing that we were talking about a couple weeks ago?
Maybe
I think there's a phantom W in that
Unless bronies are actually like
That would be brow-nies
Brownies with bacon inside of them, you know, brownies with bacon, those would be bronies
A couple of my friends, they're actually sisters, they make bacon brownies
We are very much considering a pork party for Josh's first birthday
I'm serious, it's looking like it's probably going to happen
Tarak Sakri, you could protest, you could stand outside with your PETA sign
Fuck PETA
Here's some other fun random things real quick
One of the other runner-up ideas for a party
and we're probably thinking about this for maybe second or third year
and you're going to laugh, pedo bear themed
Why would you do that for your child?
Because it's funny, because our friends would know what it is, but our family doesn't know what pedo bear is
They think it's just a teddy bear, it would be hilarious
Are you going to get a bounce house and everything?
Maybe
You should get the Pikachu bounce house where you climb into Pikachu's butt
I think Dark Sakura should dress up as pedo bear
I said internet meme themed party
because we were trying to think of something that's not been done before
Pork party I think is pretty
You should do a troll party and make everyone wear troll masks
I was going to say, if you do an internet meme party, I will come as Nyan Cat
I will have little rainbow streamers behind me, I'll wear a pop tart
I think that would be funny, but maybe not this year
The only reason she was thinking of doing pork party
I guess some of her Facebook, like mommy friends or whatever
One of them makes cakes, and they said
Oh I can make a pig cake with an apple in its mouth
And the apple would be its own personal little cake for Josh
Little known fact about me, my uncle is actually a pig farmer
They have a ranch out in the not so city part of Sacramento
Like out in the valley a little more
They actually have a little ranch out there where they raise pigs to be sold for food basically
For all those pickled pigs feet
And it's kind of sick because we used to go there for Easter and Christmas and all the holidays
And I was younger, and man we would just have a feast of bacon and all that stuff
And it didn't really hit me until much later in life
Oh god, it was kind of
Sad
I'm gonna take some bacon outside for the pigs
We used to go out to the barn and look at the baby pigs
It was like, oh it's cute the baby pigs
And we'd come in and just feast on ham
And now I'm realizing like, god that was kind of messed up
Ham, okay even when I did eat pork
Ham has always been so disgusting to me
It just tastes like, not right
Okay I promise we'll get into video games here in a minute
But I have to say about like ham
I gotta say I am a ham person
I like the honey baked hams, those are my favorite
But for Thanksgiving, I really don't like turkey
I am not a turkey person
I always get my own drumstick
My mother's very kind in that she always makes a ham
Which is funny because I have two brothers
And we would always fight over them
So I'd just say fine, neither of you can have them
I'd wrap them up and put it in the fridge
Alright, video games, quickly before we get into gaming weeks
I want to do a quick follow up to a story from last week
It's not on the show roll anywhere
I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf who of course
As he has been for many many many many weeks
Is on before us as we do tape live every Sunday night at allgames.com
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
Right after Bobby's show
One of the things he was talking about on his 300th episode
Grats on the ding by the way
He was talking about the whole update to the Nintendo games
Supposedly, as we reported on last week or the week before
Are not coming to the US
Because Nintendo just has no interest in those games at that time
There's this whole Operation Rainfall
That's trying to get the games localized
Well apparently there's some mole within Nintendo
That reported to Operation Rainfall that
Yeah, these games are coming
It's just a very hush thing right now
Which leads me to believe that
You hit the nail on the head last week, Loki
When Reggie's gonna come out
It may not be in XD3, it could be like the holiday
It'll be in XD3
You think all the way to XD3?
I think it's XD3 because localization doesn't take that long
And because they want to have something saying
Hey, you know, we haven't forgotten about you
Because the whole point is they're gonna try to
Let the hardcore gamers know
We haven't forgotten about you
That's why you need to buy our new system
So, I mean, granted, those are Wii games
But they still play on the new Wii U system
But that's kind of the whole theme
They're gonna be trying
Because they need that hardcore crowd
Because the casual gamer doesn't give a shit about their new system
I mean, eventually they will because of the touchscreen thing
But it's gonna be convincing these people
That really bought the system for Wii Sports
And Wii Sports Resort and maybe Mario Kart or something like that
Why they need to go out and buy another system
Well, I mean, Nintendo doesn't just have to have
One press conference a year, though
I don't see anything stopping Nintendo from
Thinking again what you said last week about
They'll come out and say
Except you said it a lot more angry
You know, the fans demanded it and here it is
You know, there's no reason they couldn't do this big thing
At Nintendo World in New York City
Where they'll have a big press conference
And invite people to play the games in for the first time
Because it's what you the gamer wanted
And we listened because we're the company that
Loves our fans
They're just
I mean, I don't know
They could have easily phrased it away without
Because what's the point in saying, you know
Why even say
No, it's not something that we're working on right now
Here's an important point from Dark Tetsuya
In our chatroom at chat.orangesonsready.com
C goes back to when they said
Not at this time
Is it possible that the intern that updates Facebook
Perhaps just, you know, had to say something
But realized they couldn't exactly
Spoil an upcoming press conference
No, they don't have to say anything
And if it is E3
Why do they even have to say anything
I mean, let's put it this way
They went out during E3
And said, hey, we're gonna work on a Smash Bros game
I mean, we haven't started working on a Smash Bros game yet
But we will eventually work on
I mean, if they're gonna announce stuff
That we will eventually work on
Versus something that they maybe
Just started working on or something that they're planning on
Why can't they say, hey, you know what fans
You're right, we are gonna be
Bringing these games over to
North America, stay tuned for more information
That's all they had to do
People wouldn't have been pissed
They could still announce all their stuff at, you know, E3
And say, hey, you know what, we heard you guys
Without looking like complete assholes
At the same time
But no, they decided, hey, we're just gonna say
No, we don't have any plans to do that
And then everyone gets pissed off at them
I kinda think the intern just did what they had to do
And, you know
Well, then they should come out
They have an opportunity to update at any time
Hey, you know what, word is actually
We are gonna be bringing these over
You know, stay tuned for more details
Now, here's a thought from
Black Wolf, who's in our chat room
And I actually think this is a great idea
How about PAX?
Reggie comes out at PAX and says, here's your game, bitches
And Breakman follows that up with
Then he bitch slaps everyone
But are they doing any
Sort of press conference at PAX?
PAX doesn't usually have press conferences
But PAX, they will probably have a presence
On the show floor, usually the Washington
Cause PAX is up in Seattle
At the time anyway
And they're right in the backyard of Microsoft and Nintendo
So there's no reason
I remember the one year we all went to PAX
I believe that had been the first time that
Animal Crossing was shown out on the floor
I don't think it had made E3 that year
My memory is a little bit fuzzy
But I seem to remember there was something on the floor that year
That actually was new for Nintendo
That they had not shown at E3
And PAX being the whole fan service
Expo, and you know
Delivering what the fans want
Would actually seem like
The perfect idea
I think that's a great idea from Bobby
The only thing that I think
Might be a little bit, maybe not
Is that it's a little soon
But it could also kind of add up to this bigger equation
That maybe Nintendo wanted to make
E3 all about
You know, these games
And they want to make PAX about the other stuff
It sounds like PAX would make more sense because
If they're localizing this stuff for Europe already
Localizing it for the United States
North America is
I mean, they've already done all the voice and
Translation work
I don't think that they really need to do anything
I think all they have to worry about is the NTSC versus PAL
That's the stuff they have to worry about
Not just rendering, I mean that
High def, it doesn't matter anyways
Or 480p
It's the Wii
It doesn't matter, okay, let me put it this way
Your Wii will interpret it any way
It doesn't matter
I don't know
They could have done it in a more
You know
Polite way without ruining any surprises
I mean, they could just say, stay tuned for more details
And they'll be like, oh, here it is
It just wouldn't surprise me if there's that whole
Corporate, you know, like
We make the plan in January
Of 2011 for
Here's the marketing for the entire year
And we're going to announce this game
At this expo and this, and we have a tight calendar
Of who's going to what expo to show, what game
You know, this stuff is just mapped out a year in advance
And the interns know
That update Facebook, I better stick to
The schedule, you know, I can't
Or they may not even know themselves
But as we're going to get into more information
That's not true
We know that's not true, they've come out and said that
That's not true because of certain factors that play into
Certain things
And you can't just stick to a strict schedule
Anyways, because you don't know what's going to happen
I guess that's true
And if you have a bunch of people that are rabid fans over something
And you are planning on doing this
With a bone or something like that to keep them interested
So they're not thinking, oh well, Nintendo's abandoned
Me, you know, well screw them
I'm going to move on
And, I mean
I don't know
Alright, let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about
The video games we have been playing this week
The stuff that has been released in America
Unless you guys are playing import games this week
Which is certainly possible
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
It was a little more eventful
I played that game that you sent me
Terrarium
Terraria I think
It's pretty
It's pretty fun so far
But it's still Horizontal Minecraft
I dug a lot of holes
And died a lot
And popped slimes with pickaxe
I played some WoW
One
Item level
Stupid Firelands
What else did I do?
I played Portal 2
Some more today
And I played Droplets the other night
What do you do in Portal 2
On all your replays
Are you going through for achievements
Or are you just trying to get your speed better
I've done all of the single player achievements
Except for one of the speed levels
But mostly I just go through
Because it's fun
I just keep playing it
I like watching your favorite movie
I played
Some Doom 2
That's kind of random
Yeah it's not
As good as I remember
But it's still fun
I still remember a lot of my cheats
IDGAF
IDGAF
IDKFA
You know
I just remember in Doom
When you could make the screen
You could adjust the screen size
To get your computer to render it better
For older systems
My 386 or my 486 100
I don't even remember it so long ago
I had to put the window at the minimum size
To get it to run decently
It was this little tiny window on my screen
It's like trying to play a Game Boy
On my computer screen
I just always remember liking the
Names of the levels like Hurt Me Plenty
And all that
That was my favorite one
I found out that I can't play Hexen anymore
I really can't
Which is the motion sickness of the first person
No it's just not great anymore
Aww how sad
I know but I still remember my codes for that too
Like God Mode was Satan
And NRA
Was all weapons
Are you picking up these games
For Steam sale?
Well I already had Hexen
But I picked up the Doom Pack
I'm so mad I missed that
The Doom Pack was 8 bucks
I missed the Quake Pack when it was on sale
Yeah it's probably still a good deal
At 20 bucks but there's just something about the whole
You're getting it at a really good deal
Steam sales are so dangerous
I'm telling you when we get to my gaming week
I wish I put out all the sim stuff cheap
Just wait Rob
I'm sure it'll go on sale again once Rage comes out
Oh it will I'm sure
I'll wait for the sale
I have plenty to hold me over
For months
Anyhow Dark Soccer
Well I tried to play DAC again
I check DAC
And I always keep forgetting that I need a controller to play it
So I'm like
Just grab one of the Xbox controllers one day
There you go
Alright
Loki! How was your gaming week?
I didn't play a whole lot
It was mainly just Grand Theft Auto this week
Rockstar Games decided to finally
After I don't know how many years
Well a couple years now
To patch the mods again for Grand Theft Auto
Now they didn't patch everything
They patched it kind of like the way they did with 4wares
Mainly everything that
I mean most of the things that you could use
I guess to grief other players
Like they patched all the weapon mods
And
Some other random stuff which is kind of lame
But I still can do like vehicle mods
If we wanted to and the map mods
Which is kind of cool because I'm still working on something for that
So
We went back to playing regular
Ballad of Gay Tony Deathmatch
Again and I'm trying to work my way
Up the leaderboards again
Since I haven't played in a while
And a lot more people are playing my ranks drop
Pretty significantly but
Still you know
Out of like 200,000
Plus players you know being like
85 is not bad
So
You know just still working on getting
Up there
I was at one point trying to beat this
Player named Chuck Norris just because it would be funny
Because you know you have to defeat Chuck Norris
But now he's gone so
Chevy Chase
I'm after you
A little bit of Earth Defense Force
And
That was pretty much it this week really didn't play a whole lot
Alright
My gaming week
Let's see I
I found that Steam sale
To be very dangerous that whole thing that they're doing
This week and I have easily dropped
40 to 50 dollars
On games which is exactly what they want
People to do that's the whole trick behind it
Man I got to say I picked up a lot of good stuff
So here's some of the stuff I've played this week
One of my favorites
And it's one of those things where I've known
About this game for the longest time and I hear
Good things about it and I just for whatever
Reason have never played it I'm just
Too busy playing WoW or something on the
Xbox or what have you and I always
Neglect to look at this game but I finally picked up
Beat Hazard which is
A game that's available on Steam and it's on sale
There's this whole combo pack going on
Right now where it's Beat Hazard, Ultra
And all this other stuff
Basically in a nutshell imagine if
Like Geometry Wars
Kind of met a game where you
Could put your own music
In and then add
Super seizure robots to the whole thing
That's what Beat Hazard is
Look I usually
Am not the photo sensitive type and
You know I don't usually have reactions
To video games but I got to say in playing
Beat Hazard I seriously think
I felt a little odd playing
It like I was like you know I'm not usually
Prone to this type of stuff but this game is gonna
Do it like if any game is gonna set me
Off and cause me to have a seizure it's probably
Gonna be this game
If you haven't played the game you know
You're this little ship and the way it controls
Is kind of interesting on the computer because
You use your mouse to target
Things and use the button to shoot
On your mouse but you use WASD
To move your ship so it's kind of a neat
Little control system you know it takes the place
Of two thumb sticks which you know I'm sure
You would use if I plugged in a controller but I
Kind of like the whole WASD and using
Your mouse to shoot and
Basically you can load your own
MP3's or iTunes songs
Or you can use like the 20 some
Odd songs that are just a part of the game by
Default all kind of techno
Trancy Ravey songs or
You can play the Lady Gaga songs like I did which is
Actually a lot of fun and the
Ships kind of
I guess are generated based on the music
But the speed is kind of
Driven by the music and most
Importantly kind of the pulse
Of the bullets and the background
And everything is driven by the beats of the game
And a lot of your power ups are based around
Volume you can the
Basically the more powerful you are the louder
The song gets which is kind of cool
So yeah you know for
About I think I paid about
Like six bucks for the whole thing I don't
It was a pretty good deal so
Very happy with that
Some of the other games I've bought
During this sale
Arkon I had no
Idea that the classic 80's
Commodore 64 slash
NES game Arkon was
Now on PC until
I
Believe it was Travis
From under sedation live
Mentioned it to me on Twitter that
Arkon was available on the iPhone
And I was like oh snap there's like this
Whole iPhone game out there and it kind of had me thinking
If they've done it for the iPhone I wonder if there's a new
PC version so I searched for Arkon
Arkon on Steam and sure enough
A brand new Arkon game has been released
And I'm like just mind blown
How long has this game been out
And I didn't even know about it and I used to love this game
Back in the day so I bought the new one and I haven't
Played enough of it yet where I could really tell you a lot
About it but I will say
I played through at least the tutorial mode
And it's definitely the old school Arkon
I'm just hoping there's the online
Play and all that I haven't again I've played
Like maybe 15 minutes of this
Before I got distracted with something else
So I'll try to play more over the next week
And what have you
Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelaunge.com
Kaijuto says
Beat Hazard will blow your eye sockets
I played the demo and it almost
Killed me now to be fair
You can turn down the intensity
Of the effects but who wants
To do that
I will say this as well
One thing I love about Beat Hazard
Is that there's just
For what is a pretty simple concept
They've poured a lot of
Replayability factors into the game
In the way of like power-ups
And achievements
Like the more you level through
And the more songs you play
You get power-ups
That you can permanently buy for your ship
And then you can you know pick
Like five of the power-ups for your ship for a song
And a lot of times what the power-ups
Do is they do things to your ship to increase
Either survivability or score
So if you're the type that wants to go for the
Highest score possible amongst your friends
You use the
Enhancements that you unlock the more you play
To get that and I just think
That's kind of a neat way to do it
And what kind of really enhances
The playability of what's otherwise a
Very simple game
I was gifted Plants vs. Zombies
By our listener
XLink who was on Horde House a couple weeks ago
It's kind of like a late birthday present
And finally
I know Dark Soccer is a huge fan of Plants vs. Zombies
Yes I am
And I've played the game before
I've played the free one online but
Now I have the PC version and I was playing that
For a little bit and perfecting
My strategy against zombies I didn't realize
There was a whole little mode where you could create
Your own zombie and then like that zombie
Will show up in the final wave as you play the game
Oh that was kind of cool
I think if you do more than one though both of them can show up
Oh really? I always did the one
Not the point of it at first was just to make
A little
Avatar that you could use on
Instant Messenger or on web forums and stuff
Which is actually a really smart idea
To try and get the game exposed
And I'm surprised more people haven't kind of hopped
On that train where like
Let people make a custom avatar from your game
Which
Okay now I'm sounding kind of stupid because that's what
The Xbox 360 avatar stuff is all about
But I guess this is the first time I've kind of seen it in a PC
Fashion and kind of let them
Spread the word about the game
Like I think it would be a great idea for like the next Elder Scrolls game
On PC to do is let me make a little
Avatar on my character and then I could use it on
Web forums and stuff I don't know
Something like that
That's kind of neat I hope they have something like that for Saints Bros. III
Because they know they're going to be putting out their
Character creator slightly early before the game
That would be kind of cool to have
You know
Your character on the avatar
So I've bought some games see here's the other
Dangerous thing about the Steam sale
I've bought games I haven't even freaking
Played yet and one of the games I
Bought was Amnesia
Which is supposed to be just like
A horrifically
Scary game like I was even
Scared by the trailer
It's like seriously like a scare the pants
Off of you game don't play this in the dark
Type of thing so I'm excited
To check out Amnesia do you know much about this game
Dark Soccer because you like the survival horror stuff
Go look at the trailer on there for Amnesia
You have to tell me if you think it's scary
Or not so alright
That's all I'll say about my
Gaming week otherwise it's been the other stuff
Final Fantasy 13
I think I'm up to like 30
Hours 35 hours spent
In the game I think I'm getting
Closer to the end I'm still in chapter 11
Because I've been doing crap ton of sidequests
But getting
Closer to the end I'm back in the main story now
I'm climbing a big tower for those
Of you that know the game and probably
Ring a bell to some of you
Are you running up that hill?
Yes I'm running up that hill
To make a deal with a foul C
And convince them to swap our places
Let's see
And then you know Warcraft
And all that other fun stuff alright
That's it for my gaming week
Let's get into some housekeeping real quick

Gaming industry this week and get your thoughts
Live in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com
And on the skype line later on
Loki start us off
Ah yes square enix was a little bit sad
After their game Deus Ex
Human Revolution has
Been leaked out to
The public
Apparently preview code for the game
Which was hosted on steam
The account was hacked
It was a game preview
Code meant for
People in the
Preview review program
Kind of for the press
And one of the outlets I guess
It's a french outlet
And their account got hacked
And this game was downloaded
And then of course it spread out there
Kind of like wildfire
Right now they're going after 15
Unnamed John Does and seeking
Monetary damage in excess of
$5,000 for the
Preview's distribution
Now the game wasn't finished
But it was kind of a preview build
That leaked out there
And obviously this is not the first time
Something like this has happened
This is 2, same thing happened to that
And god how many other games
Preview builds get leaked out for
A lot
But they're none too happy about that
Interesting
Um
Steam's supposed to be like
The super secure thing
And it's interesting that the game
Kind of leaked off of it
When it sounds like this might be more
Of like an error
Or some sort
It was an Italian gaming outlet
That leaked that out
Or that the account got hacked from
Not Steam then to clarify
It seems to be kind of
Confusing where it's come from
It seems that even Square doesn't know yet
Rather than aim its suit at the
Italian gaming outlet
The Japanese publisher is instead
Directing its legal team at the 15
People that stole the game
Or I guess that are
Distributing the game
It takes 15 people to
Download a game
They don't know who they are because it's gonna be 15 IP addresses
Pretty much, yeah
What do you think
About a case like this? Do you think Square
Has a case against these folks?
If they can track them down
Because they hacked into someone's account
So the crime that's committed
Is impersonating someone else's account
To get the game
We'll see
But what if those people come back and say
I don't have my IP
I wasn't driving
Somebody hacked into my Wi-Fi
That's the problem
Because it is the burden of proof
They need to have the proof that they did it
And just seeing that you have your IP
People can spoof IPs easy
Especially if they're smart
If these people are
The smart hacker types
Obviously they're gonna be running their
IP through proxies and stuff like that
So it'll be even more difficult to track them down
I gotta ask you about this
Not to get too tangent-y
But since you brought up the whole IP spoofing
It made me think of this, a big article I read this week
What do you think about this whole
Agreement that I'm hearing
That was passed this week between the major
ISPs including
Comcast, AT&T, and a bunch of the other big ones
And copyright holders, essentially
Where there's the whole
We are going to
Notify users when IPs are identified
But if it's
Which is kind of what was already being done
But now I think it's more streamlined
And consistent between all the companies
And if a user
Keeps ignoring the alerts
They will get pop-ups that they have to
Acknowledge
Or they might even get phone calls at some point
I don't know, I haven't obviously read too far into this
I don't know, what do you think
About this whole thing?
Well, there's a couple things that are
Weird about it
One, it would have to be
The way I understood it was
I believe
It's going to be like, for example, if you were
Downloading TV episodes or something like that
Of BitTorrent or something, and they figured out
That you were doing it, or your IP
Was attached to it, they would notify you
To make sure that, you know, it's not
Say, someone
Jumping onto your Wi-Fi or something like that
They would notify you
That that's going on, if you ignore
That, and then they keep sending you
Notices and eventually, you know, they will start
Throttling your internet and whatnot
But the problem is
I don't think that actual Comcast
Or something like that are monitoring traffic
I mean, it would be very difficult for them to figure out
What you're downloading
Well, the copyright holders will
I'm assuming that what they do
Is they seek out the
Torrent, and they download it
And they can see all the IPs that are sharing it
And so they send
Requests to the ISPs
Of all those IP addresses
So, I mean, you can
There's a way
That you can get around with them
Tracking where you're actually browsing
But for one, using
A DNS that's not
Provided by your ISP
You can use 4221
Or whatever is one of those
You can
I think they have ways
You can even download BitTorrent
Via
Proxy or something like that
And you know what?
There's other options out there other than BitTorrent
I mean, not just BitTorrent
But there's newsgroups
And there's
Just plain straight up hosting
A file on one of the file sharing sites
Like MegaUpload or
RapidShare
MediaFire, whatever
So do you think this is going to be another case of
The piracy will just evolve like it did when Napster got shut down?
I don't think it's really
I don't think anything is really changing too much
They're starting to
They're kind of doing it to scare people
To get them saying
We're going to be watching what you're doing
But once again
And that's just if you're interested in
Stealing music or
Music or TV
Or something like that
I don't think game publishers
PC publishers are really
Going out there hunting these people down
There's a lot of stuff out there that's still going to get pirated
But you know what?
If you look at the NPA and the NPA
Two people that are backing this
Of course they're supporting it
Because all the backers you'll notice
Are just all the NPA, the RIA
And all the film
And music studios and stuff like that
You don't see any
Well the thing that surprised me most
About the law was this whole fact that
If you want to dispute it
You can, but you have to pay
$35
To have that investigated
Something about that kind of struck me as wrong
Like I don't like the fact that
You know, and granted
I try to have a secure setup in my home
And all this stuff, but there's just something about
My grandma
Who wouldn't know how to do all that stuff
Where somebody else probably set it up
For her that may not have done it
If somebody steals that wifi
She would have to pay $35
To have that investigated, something strikes me as really
Wrong about that
If any company asked me to
Pay $35, I would just drop them
Bill, yep, you know what
What if you have no other options in your neighborhood?
I have to use one particular ISP
In my neighborhood, and I have no
Other options, unless I want to go to DSL
Which I really don't want to do
I don't really know what you could do
I don't know either
That's a sticking point for me
I mean, I don't
I don't really pirate games
I don't pirate games
The last time I would ever pirate a game was
Back in the Playstation 1 days
I would do import games
I would, you know,
Download some of those online
Because I felt it was kind of unfair that if the publishers
Do not plan to release the games in this country anyway
Then what
You know, I'm not gonna pay the outrageous fees
Which at that time were like sometimes
$70, $80 to own the game
I'll leave that to collectors that want that stuff
Blink, blink
But, you know, I'm not gonna get
On a moral soapbox about it or what have you
You know, it's just the way it is
But, if I'm gonna
Download like last night's episode
Of The Voice
Like, really?
I'm gonna get
My ISP shut off over that
Like, it just kind of stinks
I don't know
A little ridiculous
If it ends up being
Where they're gonna be tracking you in a very simple
Fashion like you said, you know, where they've
Downloaded the torrent and
They do it in a way that
You know, they can see all your IPs
What's gonna end up having is a few things
One, people are just gonna stop
Listing the torrent as, you know,
The voice episode, blah, blah, blah
It'll be just some random gibberish
They're gonna start, you know,
Putting stuff behind, you know
Membership sites or something like that
Where you have to, you know,
Be a member of the site to find these torrents
Or something like that
There's ways around everything
But, you know, as soon as they figure out
What they're doing to find these people
Or whatever, there will be new programs
There will be new
Protocols, whatever, that people will develop
In order to get around it
They're already renaming torrent files
With like
Weird spaces between letters
And special characters and things
So
You know, you'd be surprised
They are going after
Like, some TV show watchers
Who was it in chat said they got a letter
About Game of Thrones? Oh, there it is, Rama
I got a notice the other week about someone in my house
Downloading Game of Thrones
Granted, that's an HBO show and HBO is a pay network
I mean, I sort of see where they
I mean, that is a huge
Because they make a lot of money off the DVD sales and so forth
So I can kind of see why they are very
Rampant about trying to block
The
Downloading of the shows, but like, the over-air networks
Is the ones that, like
And I don't know
What other extents they've gone to protect their stuff
I mean, I have nothing, I just
I hope it doesn't become that, you know
I'll say right now, I download Supernatural
Because I hate watching commercials
And so I'll just watch it on my computer
But I also own
Like, several of the box sets of the seasons anyway
Okay, because I was going to say
Devil's Advocate
Commercials are what make the TV shows free
But I also
Have the box sets
And a bunch of merchandise
I have the comics
You could probably watch them all on Netflix anyway
Probably
But, I mean, regardless
There's episodes
I believe up on WB's
Not WB, why am I saying WB?
It's a
CW
CW, yeah, on their website
So, I mean, it's not like it's a big deal
I just hate commercials
Now it's all about product placement
That's why we have more product placement games
I still watch my Doctor Who
Some of the old episodes of How I Met Your Mother
And stuff like that, where they're digitally altering them now
Where they're adding TVs and stuff in the background
With stuff on them for different movies
Yeah, there's reruns of
Some of the 2009 episodes are like that
With The Zookeeper in the background
Or
What is it, Country Strong or something like that
Huh, I hadn't heard about that
God, you
Nothing in the world would get me to go see The Zookeeper
Like, maybe if someone threatened
To kill my family
If I wouldn't go watch the movie
I guess I would have to go see the movie
You'd have to debate how much you love your family
There would be that moment of pause
But
I mean, seriously
That movie looks so awful
I can't even
Anyhow, real quick
Before we start jumping back into actual
Pertinent information
Have you seen the trailer for Jack and Juliet?
I don't think so
It's a new Adam Sandler movie where he plays
Both Jack and Jill
No, I haven't heard that
You think The Zookeeper looks bad
Uh, there
Does he have sex with himself? Because Divine did that
In the 70s
No, no, no
But it looks fucking terrible
Alright, let's get back to game stuff, sorry
How about the Wii U? Wii U
Talking about why was the Wii U
Showing, you know, a lot of folks at E3
And I think I had said this too
Who was showing what said
Nintendo, maybe Nintendo did this too early
Maybe they should have just waited until they actually had
A little bit more to show, like, I don't know, some actual
Games and not just a bunch of concepts
Well
Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo
Has said that, you know what, maybe
Nintendo did show the Wii earlier
Than they had planned due to
An increased fear
Of leaks
What do you mean fear of leaks? There were already leaks
I know, right?
But more could they have possibly leaked out about that system
Here's a quote
In the past, when Nintendo did not receive as much attention
As we do now, we did not have to worry
About the spread of our confidential information
Since it did not have any value in society
But since the Nintendo DS and the Wii
Created a social phenomenon
I like how they kind of just slipped that in there
Please
Social phenomenon
But it's actually blowing smoke up their own ass
Like, that's literally what they're doing in that statement
You know, since we
Decided that, you know, our systems
Are just revolutionizing the world
In fact, you know, we would go as far as saying
They're about to cure cancer
But, you know, hey
That's what the fans
Are saying about our system
Why doesn't he just say, thanks
To the internet? Because back in
The day, you know, you would get the word
From the Nintendo Fun Club
Or Nintendo Power, which ironically enough
Were also both Nintendo
You have to understand, because we're so awesome now
Let me show you this graphic behind me here
You see right here, we were awesome
But now we are, like, ten times as awesome
You do understand, that is
Way more awesome than we were before
Therefore, we have to show the Wii U early
Alright, look, I gotta
Let me read the rest of the statement here
Because I'm too hung up on this whole
Now, if this starts to be confusing
I have a pie chart, too
Nintendo used to have value
Nintendo now has value in society
Anyhow
Nintendo's next move
Commands great attention and
Extreme news value
Therefore, although we go to great lengths
To ensure that this will not happen
There are cases where, even if a person
Receives information under a non-disclosure agreement
The information is leaked because there is
Great temptation
Even for the Wii U, some people may be aware
If they had been checking the internet
That information with true and false rumors
Mixed together was spread on the internet before the announcement
So they kind of admit that
Yeah, some of it was out there
Therefore, as for new hardware
Even if we wanted to, it is extremely challenging
To realize the situation where a product
Is announced and then launched the next day
So, let's summarize
That quote in our own words
Because we are so fucking awesome
That everybody wants to report on our
Farts, and has reported
On our farts
We had to, you left us no choice
But to get up on the E3
Stage and fart
They didn't have to
Wii U
Wii U
Wii U
Here's the thing, they don't have to do shit
They don't have to do anything
They're succumbing to peer pressure
That's because they're farting
I mean, seriously, they don't have to do any
If people think that you're releasing a new system
You can either tell them, yeah, we're releasing a new system
Or you can just say, I'm not telling you shit
I mean, what are they gonna do?
Speculate all they want, but that's all it's gonna be
Is speculation, and you know what you need to do
Is you need to fucking clamp down on all those people
That are violating your goddamn NDA
When some press outlet says
Hey, I heard that the Wii U has a tablet
For a controller, then you tell them
Well, you ain't gonna see shit anymore
About Nintendo stuff because you violated
Your NDA, you dumbass
That's all they gotta do, oh, it's so difficult
To secure my information
Gee, if only there were a way I could
I don't know, get people to follow my NDA
Maybe if you
It's called a guillotine
It's called repercussions for people violating your NDA
That's why you have a non-disclosure agreement
Take those fuckers to court
It's in there
I mean, come on, it's like
You know
Oh, you wanna learn about the new Pokemon game?
Too bad, cause you're gonna have to wait until after retail
Was Nintendo really worried
About disappointing at E3 this year
Because, like, seriously, Reggie could've just
Reggie could've got up on stage
And just hula-hooped for 30 minutes
And there would be that analysis
On X-Play, like Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb
So, the Wii hoop
Wasn't that an interesting display
Of, you know, technology
Of pelvis shaking from someone
Who doesn't need to shake his pelvis
I give those pelvic thrusts a 4 out of 5
Rob, if they didn't talk about the Wii U
What the fuck would they have talked about
Cause, seriously, they had nothing to announce
This year, they had nothing
It was like, hey, yeah, well, we've got
No, they could've
Stretched the fuck out of those discussions
Of the Wii games that they didn't
Really show, like Rhythm Heaven
And all the stuff that we poo-poo
And would they have gotten slammed for that?
Probably, but then they could've shown the trailer
For the last story
Or Xenoblade, which we all think is happening anyway
I think most of us going into E3
Were pretty convinced that Nintendo was gonna show
The last story for an American release
Why is it so difficult if they're planning on
Working on that anyways, or they're planning on bringing that over
That they couldn't announce that
Even if, you know what, they decide, hey, you know what
We're not gonna bring it over here at some point
If they change their minds, they can do that
Games get cancelled all the time
Look at True Crime, you know, Hong Kong
There's a big ol' trailer for that during Activision's conference
You know, a couple years ago
But that game got cancelled
Yeah, it sucks that it got cancelled, but you know what
Games get cancelled, so if they decide, hey
We can announce this, but there may be a chance
That we're not gonna bring it over here
So what?
They're gonna announce, instead of saying, hey
I hear you guys like Smash Brothers
Well guess what, we're gonna work on Smash Brothers
Sometime
In the next couple years
It's like, thanks
I think
Game guru in our chat room
At chat.ownerswanttrader.com says
They could've focused on the 3DS
You know, and they kinda did for half their conference
Their conference this year was the Zelda thing
Which, that did feel like a bunch of hot air
Like, I'm sorry, but the whole Zelda thing
It's like, okay, you've been showing this game for like four years
And the whole symphony thing
And all that was really just dragging it out
Like, we know you're fucking showing the Wii U
This is just, you know
This is literally just pomp and circumstance
About how fucking great Nintendo is
But here's the great thing about Nintendo
They could've done pomp and circumstance
Like, they could've done, like, symphonic
Announcements for all those 3DS games
Like, they could've had somebody dressed up as
They could've had Rama, Black Luigi
Come out and go, hello
And look where it goes
Miyamoto with the fucking shield and sword
I mean, that's like, just like
That's the kind of crazy bat shit
Stuff that they need to be doing again
To get people excited about the games
I'm sorry, you know what
Every time I see them put out a new
Mario Kart and Animal Crossing game or something like that
I mean, really, what the fuck are they doing?
They're adding some more useless garbage
On top of these games
And then they're re-releasing them back out into the market
Or, hey, look, I know you guys wanted
Star Fox, so we're gonna give you Star Fox
That we gave you before
Awesome!
Hey, I hear you guys like Mario Brothers
We're gonna give you Mario Brothers 64 HD
Or in 3D
Thanks?
I mean, it's just
It's kind of annoying that they've got, I mean
To me, there's
I understand that, you know, there's a whole place
Where, hey, you know what, these games are good
Let's re-release them for a new generation
Or some garbage that you wanna spew
That basically, oh, well, we've run out of ideas
So we're just gonna take some of these old games
And, you know, put them back out again
We're gonna put as minimal amount of effort into them
To make them look new again, but we're gonna put them
Back out there, because this is what the fans want
You know what?
Fans
Let me just talk to you here real quick
Here's something that you can do, guess what
You know that those consoles
When people are done playing them
They're still out there
I mean, they don't just, like, evaporate
They are out there
I thought they were on the landfill in New Mexico
I know, it's so crazy
Did you know that if you wanna play
Oak Green Up Time, you don't have to spend
$299 plus, you know,
$40 for the game
Yes, I know, this is a shocker
That's not what Beyonce told me in the ad
I understand, but Beyonce's full of shit
Here's all you have to do
You can literally go out to your local
Garage sales, or
There's this website out there called eBay
Where people sell things
This is a game that Robin Williams named his daughter after
Isn't that worth $300?
Yeah, but Robin Williams is kinda crazy
Didn't you see the crazy beard?
It's starting to look like a homeless crazy beard
I see where you're going with that
It's beyond Santa Claus
So, you can go on eBay
And you can buy a Nintendo 64
And Oak Green Up Time
And guess what?
Just be careful that it's not coming from China
For a limited amount of time
It's within that $299 price range
About, I don't know,
40 other games!
And you can play it
All on your
You can buy everything on the Steam Marketplace right now
For $299
And you can play it, and yes, it won't be in 3D
But you know what?
Actually, wrong
It doesn't matter, because you know what?
You're playing with it
The way it was meant to be played on Nintendo 64
I don't understand why
That's the whole thing with the 25th anniversary collection or whatever
That $40 could have easily bought you
$40 could have bought you
We need to do a mock commercial for 3DS
Oak Green Up Time
That has the whole interspersed Robin Williams and his daughter
And I'll play the game
The way it was meant to be played
Just $1999 on eBay
It's not even $1999
I don't know
It would have been different
If it was something like
Hey, you know what?
We're going to bring out a Zelda anthology
We're going to have Zelda 1, Zelda 2
All of them on one disc
Like they kind of did for the pre-order thing for Wind Waker
It was a pre-order bonus!
Pre-order bonus!
Stuff that nowadays is just like a code for a shirt
For my character in game
Or armor that's red instead of silver
I mean
Why couldn't they just
They could sell that disc
They could easily just stuff
A couple more games on there
Put Wind Waker in the box or something like that
Cause that game hasn't been sold forever
Throw Twilight Princess back in there
Because hey, you know what?
In case someone doesn't have it
And a little bit of extra content
And holy crap, that's a great deal
And actually worth my time
And hell, you don't have to do anything to them
Because people liked the games the way they were
But no
They need an excuse for people to buy the 3DS
It's kind of a gimmicky system
And so what a better way to do that
Is to take one of their most popular Zelda games
And just put it back out there
With minimal effort
There's actually more to this whole Wii U story
Let's make it a four hour show tonight
Let's get Loki more to rant about
The Wii U apparently will not have a unified online network
Like Xbox Live or something like that
As if these kind of earlier quotes and things
Are to be read into
Reggie Fils-Aime
I guess in a recent interview with Forbes
Said that Nintendo is
Quote, creating a much more flexible system
That will allow the best approaches
By independent publishers
To come to bear
So instead of a situation where a publisher
Has their own network and wants
That to be the predominant platform
And having arguments with platform holders
We're going to welcome that
We're going to welcome that from the best and the brightest
Of the third party publishers
No, here's the way I look at that
We have no plans
We're just going to leave it up to you
I honestly am reading that as
We're looking at the third parties
To do the work for us
I'm sorry, that's what it is
I'm sure that everybody has trouble
Working with Xbox Live
To me, I don't see any publishers
Having trouble working with Xbox Live
This is funny
Because this does tie into something topical
And it's the whole EA vs. Steam thing
That's going on
That yes, I realize comes up later in the show
There's this whole thing going back and forth
With EA and Steam right now
Where Steam has forbidden the EA games
To come on the marketplace
For Steam
And a lot of it has to do with the fact that EA
Wants to have their own servers
For their own patches
And EA wants it all to themselves
And this was a big sticking point early on
With Microsoft in the early days of Xbox Live
So
Nintendo, in a way, can kind of point at that
And say, we're not being lazy
We're just doing what EA wants
No, they are being lazy, because guess what
Who did they bring out on stage?
EA. But guess what?
EA is still doing that, though
EA has their own, like, you have to sign in
Through the EA service or whatever
In order to play the EA games online
Because, remember, Project $10
That's all part of that fun stuff
And then, same with like
I think there's some other services
Ubisoft has their
Kind of thing where you have to log into
As well, but EA, I know for a fact
They have their, you know
EA games login that you have to do
So they have their own thing on top of this
The fact that they don't have a unified
Service or something like that is basically
Nintendo's way of saying, we don't
Know what we're doing. I'm sorry, I think that's kind of
What it is, because they don't want to invest time
Into some sort of service like that and have it be
Inferior. Well, they sort of, and they sort of
Brought out the guy from EA
Coincidentally enough, at E3
And I got the sense that
Like, I don't know how much
I can't remember now how much was said
About online, but I remember walking away from that
Getting the sense that, like I
Was actually asking myself for a minute, like
Is EA doing their online stuff?
Like, is EA going to be doing the online stuff?
It wasn't that at all. No, I know that's not what they
But that was, like, for a moment, that was the impression
I was getting about what was being said
Because they didn't really bring up their online stuff
All it really, to me, said is, hey look
We have EA on board, they believe in our system
And EA is, you know, one of the
Biggest publishers in the world
So, you all should believe in our system
You know, don't you
See the math? This is how you, you know
Because they believe in us, you have to believe in us
That, that's
It's right here, it's on the chalkboard
Alright, one more piece of information
On the Wii U, and that has to do with
Demos for the 3DS and Wii U
Another quote from Satoru
Iwata in a conversation with investors
Quote, when Nintendo would like to ask
Users to try a specific new game
We should deliver it to their Nintendo 3DS
And possibly Wii U
With their prior consent, and recommend
That they just try it, and if they like it
They can pay for it. In this way, we need to
Introduce users to unknown products
Consumers are likely to be
Convinced to pay about 5,000 yen
For a well-established franchise product
But not all the people are willing to pay a certain
Amount of money for an innovative but unknown
Product. Now is the time to prepare for
These situations. So what's interesting about that
Is Nintendo is basically saying, we need to find
A way to just put demos on people's systems
Now, he does it, now
There is a very important quote before you run away
With this that says, you know, with their
Prior consent. They're already doing this, they're already
Doing this on the 3DS as far as like
Cause the stupid Pokemon thing downloaded
To mine, I'm like, I don't want this fucking shit
No, it didn't download automatically, did it? You had to get it through
The store. I had to get mine through the store
No, mine downloaded automatically. Really?
I know that OK Go video came in on one of the
Matches automatically, and then it was taken away
But that's not a big deal. I mean, they have the same type of thing
Right now. In fact, I think it's still around
On Xbox Live Arcade. Remember, you could
Sign up, basically, and have all the demos
For the games that come out, you know, download to your system
You can try them if you like them, then you buy them
Well now, this could be a big deal for people
That are, I mean, you know, OK, fair enough
Xbox does it too, but just, you know, throw it out there
People that have to watch their bandwidth
And, you know, with this whole 250
Gig bandwidth, some people get close
To that with all the HD movies they watch
Some people don't, maybe don't want all that data
Coming through. Well, then they don't have to
Sign up for it, but here's the thing that I think
Is more interesting is the fact that they're putting out demos
Say, I mean, Nintendo, a company that
They've said, hey, you know what?
Our games are so awesome
Remember, chart 10 times awesome as before
That we don't need demos
For them. We're just gonna, you know,
We're putting that stuff out there, and you're gonna see Nintendo
And you're like, oh, I gotta buy that
And so now, they realize
Hey, you know what? People like playing demos
To see if your game's crap
Or not
Alright, well
I like demos and hate crap
Do you like crappy demos?
No
Alright, let's move on with more news
Well, I like them because I don't have to pay for them
Dark Soccer, while you're at it, why don't you give us some more gaming news
Well, how about some Zoonie stuff?
There is a rumor that the
Zoon Marketplace is being revamped
On Xbox 360 as a streaming
Video service
And it already had the ability to
Stream, but this is specifically
For some sort of service they're gonna
Be offering, I believe something along the lines of
Like Netflix, but this of course
Is under the Zoon brand
Microsoft
Basically saying
No comment, blah blah blah
But, it could already be happening
I mean, this could
Be related to what they were announcing
At E3
At their press conference, or maybe related to
Xbox Live Diamond, who knows
Like
Okay, I already have Netflix
Well, you know
I already have Hulu
Xbox has been kind of centralizing a lot of their stuff lately
And kind of folding in dated brands
Like we had the story last week about Game for Windows
Kind of becoming Xbox.com
Didn't Xbox stop making the Zoon
Like about a year and a half ago
So, it's no surprise at all that
Something had to happen to the Zoon Marketplace
Well, and it makes sense to me because
I look at even like the Playstation Network
And stuff, they have
I don't even know how many streaming services on there
Sony has one, they have Vudu
And Netflix
And I'm sure Hulu Plus
Is on there
I think there's a few other ones on top of that
So it makes sense that they would have a few different offerings
On the Xbox Marketplace
As well
They gotta do something with that Zoon name
I would, yeah
But they're not gonna call it the Zoon
They're probably just gonna have some Microsoft streaming
Service or something like that
I don't know
This is kind of funny
Remember how we talked about Gears of War 3 leaking out last week
Well, who
Who possibly could have leaked this out
But actually
It was funny because it was
Linked out by a
Third party
I guess outsource
Company that was storing
The code on their website
Codify, they're a
Australian based hosting company
Which lists Microsoft as a client
And it
Literally was behind no protection whatsoever
All you had to do was go to
Xbox.codify.com
Which is now obviously locked up
And you can literally
Find the code right there
Just go and
Download the whole
Folders and everything
Right for the picking
That's just straight up embarrassing
That is pretty bad
Not even a login or password
The password wasn't password
There's just no password
No login, no password
There was confidential in the folder
Oh please
That was a dopey thing to do
Someone's head's rolling for that decision
That was just a lazy
Dumb thing to do
I don't care what game it was
It's an unfortunate result
And that doesn't make the result right
But come on
To take no security whatsoever
Was a horrible decision
It is pretty bad
And clearly this company
Has no security
Officer
Cyber security person
Specialist
Clearly this company has none of that
Or that person has been on vacation for six months
Dude, I mean, you could seriously
Go on
On any of these file sharing sites
Hell, they could have used
Like a site like mega upload
Or something like that
You know, some ridiculously stupid website
And at least that you can put a password on
This site, nothing
Randy in our chat room says
Somewhere an employee is being yelled at
I would say somewhere in a Microsoft meeting
An agreement is being terminated
With this company
I would say that
It's gonna be a lot more serious
And then people at that said company
Are gonna lose their jobs
And the sad thing is, it's not gonna be anybody
Involved with this
It'll be the fault of the executive
Who didn't hire a privacy person
You know what's funny too
Not only was the game leaked
But there was some of the tools that they used for the game as well
Leaked with it
It's awesome
It's sad
Alright
The gamers will never go away
But we've got to address them because it's making
The way around the game blogs
Let's see
Taiwan based component makers
According to Digitimes
Have said that
The Playstation 4 will feature
Body movement control
Similar to Kinect
And it's going to be released in 2012
This is coming from Foxcon
I'm sorry, it's not coming from
The report is further saying
That Foxcon and Pegatron technology
Who make the PS3
They will also be working on the Playstation 4
The shipment volume of the Playstation 4
In 2012 is supposed to be at least 20 million units
So there you go
Supposedly
The Playstation 4 is coming out as soon as next year
There's a few things
That seem a little weird about that
I mean, very well
Let's say if it was actually coming out next year
Then yes, it would probably have to be starting production right now
But a few things
That seem kind of off on that
Is the fact that they're looking to ship 20 million units
I mean, even if it was 20 million units worldwide
No console launch
Has been that big
Never that big
And that would be a lot of units just sitting there
A lot of wasted resources
They're going to want to have that launch
Basically the numbers
As on as possible
Because you don't want to just have all this
Hardware sitting there that's not being sold
Because that's money
That you're just pissing away
So my guess, I mean
The best console launch is I would imagine that you could
Probably push maybe
Maybe 5 million
You know, as a console launch
Or something like that
For something like this
I mean, that would be a lot
Just like right away
So 20 million, that seems wrong
The other thing that strikes me as odd
About this story is the whole
It will feature body movement control
To disconnect
I'm looking at that a little bit through side eye
Because that would show me that
Sony has already abandoned the Move
I wouldn't doubt that they would though
That makes sense
I'm a little yes and no on that
I mean, the Move definitely probably has not broken through
The way it should have
Or the way that Connect has
But at the same time
There's a part of me that wants to say
Connect hasn't really proven itself
But at the same time, yes it is the fastest selling
Like the Connect is in the rut that the Wii was in
At the same time, we all should have seen it coming
That, you know, after the initial wave of games
There's just kind of a bunch of finger tapping
On the desk, there's not a lot
And not a lot that we got excited about at E3 this year
There will be some stuff coming out
But yeah, it's not
It's not really a lot of stuff that's
Diverting from what's already out there
There's going to be dancing games
Because obviously those have done well
There's going to be sports games because those have done well
There's going to be kind of the same type of fairy
On like the Wii because that's
Just what's working
Yeah, and the other thing you also have to consider too
Is that
They're still making PS3s
And they're still, you know, the PS3 is
Going to be their push, especially with the fourth core
That they have right now
They're going to be wanting to have tons of PS3
And it's going to be hard to have
Two systems being
Manufactured at the same time
You know, I
I just don't see it happening this soon
I think they're just going to stick to their ten year plan
Because they kind of do that with the move
And I don't know if they've really tapped out yet
With what they can do on the PS3
I hope not, I mean it's not
I think that they can do a lot more
And at the end of the day it's still
A cheap Blu-ray player for a lot of people
That, you know, are as Blu-ray
Is getting into more and more homes as HDTVs
Get in more and more homes
I think, you know, Sony still has that advantage
That they're the only ones that's a Blu-ray player
Still at the end of the day
So, you know, and I think that's been helping
Move a lot more units than they might want to admit
That they would probably
Chalk up to the quality of the games
And so forth, but I think the fact that it's a Blu-ray player
Has been really moving it
So where the hell does the story come from?
Is it just a bunch of bullshit?
Or could it maybe be that there's some type of
New PlayStation 3 redesign in the works
I could see that before I would believe
That a PlayStation 4 is in the works
Like yet another PlayStation 3 slim
Maybe with
Move more integrated into it or something
I don't know if they would do that, but like
Um
I don't buy this yet
I mean, cause there's, other than someone saying
Oh, well this is what's gonna happen, we haven't seen any
You know, like with the FoxCon announcements
Usually a lot of that will see, you know
Pictures of the motherboards or something like that for these
And um
You know, some sort of physical evidence for it
Cause right now just one person's saying that that works
Because you work at a
I mean, you don't even know if you work there
You just say that you're a worker for one of these
Places, doesn't necessarily
I don't know, I don't know if I can trust that source
I would just be willing to bet right now that
It's probably
You know, I think it's gonna be
A while still before we see the new console
Unless, unless of course the Wii U really takes off
And I think that they're gonna have to kinda
Speed things along a bit, but I don't
Honestly, with the Wii U, I mean
I don't think it's gonna all of a sudden
Just take over, I mean
The Wii is still the number one
Selling console right now, but
I don't think it's
I don't think it is anymore, if you look at the monthly numbers
I haven't been able to look at
The NPD reports have changed, so I haven't gotten to see
A lot of stuff, but
You know
It's not like
I think it's still cumulatively the top overall
But it's not the month to month
Overall, it's the largest
Selling system, but
I just, I don't think
That this Wii U is gonna be
I don't think they're gonna be able to pull
Wii numbers again, because
It's kind of like, well, we've already seen
That, and yeah, the tablet thing is a little
Bit new, but
I don't know if it's gonna be enough to get people into
I mean, look at the 3DS, perfect example
The 3D's new
And I mean, granted, you know
If all things were correct
If they had a good launch lineup
I think that things should have done really well
But they just aren't utilizing
It enough, I mean
3D looks okay, but
It's just nothing, it's like
I've kind of seen the tilt controls
I've seen that before, you know
All the stuff I've seen this before, it's not new
Alright
One more story for you guys, then we're gonna
Travel around the world and look at release dates
And what's coming out in a country near you
But first, releases, I'm sorry, first
A story from Dark Sakura, then releases
I was about to say, what are you doing skipping my story
Well
The
PSP had a digital comic service
And Sony said, nope, not anymore
Cut
Yes, it is going away
It has over 4,000 different comic book issues on it
But the digital comics
Is going away
For the PSP at least
It may go to other Sony devices
But not to the PSP
I think they're getting ready to transition
To Vita Land, Vita Land
Well, what do you think about this, Dark Sakura
You're probably the biggest comic book fan here
Out of the bunch, and you know, I know you
Like the traditional comic books
How did you feel about comics on PSP?
I didn't care about them, really
I've got comics on my iPhone
I have Marvel, I use
Marvel's digital service
I have stacks of comic books
All over the house
I have a drawer in my bedroom that's nothing but comics
We have a bin at Dan's Mother's
That's nothing but comics
I have a drawer in my bedroom that's nothing but
PEZ dispensers
I almost got you a PEZ dispenser
I tried to find you a Cruella one, but they didn't have it
Anyway
But it's like
I really think that it's a transitional thing
I think that they're starting to phase out
The maybe lesser used items
That are directly related to PSP
And start getting things ready for the new system
That's how I see it
And honestly, I really don't care
Because you have to be really careful
When doing comics for a small screen format
And sometimes you lose something
Maybe at the end of the day
They just weren't selling
Did you ever buy a comic book on the PSP?
No
I'm just trying to see what else they had
They had Batman Beyond
And Ender's Game
And Suicide Girls
Maybe IOS was just doing it better
And so people that did want to do digital distribution
Went there
Who knows
It could be
And honestly, I had a few different comic book readers on my iPhone
But the ones that I always thought were the best well done
Were the ones that were
Standalone releases
Through
The app store
For example
I tried a service and downloaded a few free comics
To see what it was like
And you kind of have to
Scroll funny through the system
Whereas when I got the Star Trek movie prequel ones
Oh, Countdown
That's what it was called
Those were well done because they were actually
Resized for the screen by panel
And done where you could see the action clearly
I'm going to our chatroom
There's actually a little bit of love going on
For Marvel's digital service
DDR Dollar Bill says
I like Marvel's digital service
Game Guru says
I started using Marvel's digital service myself
Robert M. in our chatroom says
Will the PSP app still be available for back issues?
That's a good question
I don't see why they would close the app
And I would imagine their agreements with the publishers
Allow it so that if you have purchased a comic
You get to keep it
There's no reason for them to take it down
They said nothing about taking it down
They just are going to stop supporting it
Right, it'll be like Microsoft Game Room
If you really want to go into Game Room
And download a lot of the old games you can
But a new game hasn't come out in about a year now
Yeah, but they're not going to deny people
Who have already used the service
That would just be really crappy
Exactly, that's exactly it
And for the record, Marvel's digital comic service
Is really nice
Very easy to use
I'll go on Avengers West Coast
Very quickly with that
One of these days I'll get me an iPad
And I'll check that out
But we'll see
I'm a ways off from that
Alright, let's go travel the world and look at some release dates
What is coming to a gaming store near you
Logie, start us off with the US
Not a whole lot this week
Starting off with NCAA football
For Xbox 360 and Playstation 3
Gods and Heroes
Rome Rising collector's edition
Out this week on PC
Let's see
The Elder Scrolls Oblivion 5th anniversary edition
With a nice little map in there
And some DLC
Plus $10 towards Skyrim
And that's only 30 bucks
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360
And the Wii
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
Part 2 on Playstation 3
Xbox 360, Wii, DS
And PC
UFC Personal Trainer
On the Wii
And let's see here
And that's actually it
It's our week
Alright, let's look at Japan
And what's coming out over there
On the
I think it would be the 14th
It would be the release date
There is actually nothing on the Xbox 360
Of note
So turning around here to look at the Playstation 3
Releases
Playstation 3 has a couple releases
Japan Midnight gets a price reduction
On July 14th
It moves into the Playstation 3 best
As does White Knight Chronicles 2
Moves into the best series
And I believe the American
Or the Europe release of that is not too far away
I've been reading some early reviews on it
That have not been too kind
Also on the Playstation 3 this week in Japan
Brink and Tenchou no Igo
As well as Jikkyou
Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2011
Comes out this week
This is a baseball game
From Konami
With chibi little characters
Not a series I believe we have over here
Looking at some of the other systems
Trying to see if there's actually anything on the Wii at all
I don't think so
But we do have the PSP
We have
Taiko no Tatujin Portable DX
Comes out
Music game fans may recognize that as the
Taiko drumming game
Looks like there's a new version of that
This week in Japan
Unchained Blades Rex comes out this week
And Ys
Gets price reductions all over the place
As they move into the best series
Ys 1 and 2, Ys 7
And Ys vs. Sora no Kiseuke
Alternative Saga
All those are getting price reductions this week
So if you're an Ys fan that's late to the party
In Japan
Good news, you get to get in cheap now
Ys 3 is the best
One game of note on the Wii
16th from level 5
Inazuma Eleven Strikers
It's a sports game
Coming out from level 5
It's a soccer game
Looks like it incorporates characters from
Various other games and anime
So it looks like kind of like a
Fan wank soccer game
Good times
Alright, let's move on
With the UK dates
We have a few
Going ahead and pulling up that list
On the 11th we have
Air Conflict Secret Wars
And the 13th we have Boulder Dash XL
And Ms. Splosion Man
On the 15th we have
Captain America Super Soldier
Coming out on damn near everything
And also on just about everything
But maybe not as many things as Captain America
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2
Done
Nice
Told ya
Alright, let's do a couple more gaming news
Stories and then the classic game of the week
We will take a stroll down memory lane
And remember a classic game
In just a moment
People weren't really happy with the Resident Evil
Mercenaries 3D save controversy
The fact that, you know, Capcom was not allowing
People to erase their saves
Guess
Their particular save system
You know, they didn't allow people to reset
Because they're claiming it's more like an arcade game
You know, where you can't reset scores on an arcade machine
You know, this isn't the first time
Now that I think of it that Capcom has
Fucked up a save system
You may remember Dead Rising 1
They had real issues with that
It's like, do you guys not know how to program
You know, save games correctly
Is that really a problem for you?
But they're saying though
That their intent was
Never quite malicious
You know, despite the
Conspiracy theories out there
That would have you believe
And that they said that the
Reset saves was a conscious design decision
Aimed at maintaining the arcade fighter
Feeling of the title
That's so much bullshit
It's just ridiculous
You know, although they did release
This statement
And now I'm wondering, I don't know if it's bullshit
So much as it just was a dumb decision
Like, I
Wonder if somebody didn't really say
We don't need to program in the save
Delete thing, it's like an arcade
Skip that part, like just a dumb decision
There is a device out there though
That will actually erase those save games
That I saw out there
Cause there was an article I saw where you can
They're recommending, well one of the two ways
You can delete your save games, one through the game to a campfire
Two, use this device
And the device apparently allows you to back up
Game saves on 3DS and DS
And also allows you to erase them
So
They could easily just fix this with a patch
You know, 3DS games are
You can patch those
You can patch Capcom, you can patch them
You do this shit on consoles
I mean, why don't you just say
Hey, you know what, we fucked up
You guys want, you know, your save reset stuff
I'll tell you what, we're gonna go ahead and patch it in
So you can reset your saves
But no, they're being dicks, so
Fine, that's fine
I wasn't gonna buy this game anyways
And even less reason to do so now
Yeah, it's kinda one of those games that
I probably wouldn't have bought anyway
But I especially am not gonna buy it now
Let's move on to a story that's
Actually, I think this is kinda one of those
Pretty awesome stories I wanna talk about here
And this has to do with Dr. Stephen Hicks
Who is a clinical neurologist at the University of Oxford
He is working on
Some glasses
That has technology that's inspired
By Xbox 360 connect games
iPads
And what these glasses are, they're to help
Blind folks see shapes and people better
And it uses the technology
Of the Kinect and the iPads
It's mostly for folks that
Like, they can detect light
But they can't fully see
The glasses would use these cameras
That would be on corners of the lenses
To detect the information
And then it would send it to a little computer
You know, because everything's so tiny these days
I guess it's all in the glasses
The computer will then translate the information
And transmit it to LEDs
Inside the lenses of the glasses
And those LEDs would light up
In patterns that you would be trained
To understand
The visor
I know, right? And even some blogs
Around the internet put this picture of
LeVar Burton
From the next generation
With the freaking headband visor
But you know, I think that's
That's amazing that video game technology
That's one of those good stories
You'll never hear on
CNN and so forth
A doctor was inspired by what he saw with the Kinect
And what he saw with the iPads
He said, hey, if the Kinect sends out
These lasers all around the room
To detect what's in the room
Why couldn't you like
Scrunch the Kinect down into a pair of glasses
And have the glasses emit the lasers
Around the room and then kind of translate that
Into what, you know, somebody who
Maybe isn't like totally blind
But can see at least light
Maybe help kind of translate
That into something
Also, the story goes on saying
There could be an earpiece
That could possibly give detailed spoken information
Like what time a bus leaves
Could you imagine that?
Imagine this
On the front of the bus
And I'm totally making this up
It puts this image in my head
The front of the bus has one of those
QR type of codes
And so a person wearing these glasses
The laser could scan that QR code
From a distance and tell that person in their ear
This is the bus that goes to market
Or whatever
That's amazing
That's actually a really good idea
Copyright it real quick
Patent pending
But you know what I mean
I gotta hand it to this guy
I mean, thinking to put the Kinect in glasses
Is a pretty good idea
I'm just saying, you know, we have this very
Scan society where we scan codes
And now it's in the iPhone application
Why can't the visor scan those codes?
That'd be amazing
Kaijuto says
Name them Kinect specs
I know we have some blind gamers
That listen to this show
So I would really love to hear like what you think
About this
Like if this is
If you think this is gonna be amazing
Or if maybe you have
Trouble conceptualizing this
Cause you know, I read this
And I go, it's gonna help the blind see
And I go, oh that's a great thing
But you know, I'm not actually blind
So I would like to hear from somebody
To let me know if like this is actually gonna be a great
Thing
You know they're actually also working on
Retinal patches
That are supposed to rework
The way the optic nerve
Takes in the information
For cases of people with nerve damage
And it's actually very similar in theory
Because these are actually
Relaying
It's like they've got these implants that relay information
Directly into the optic nerve
So that people can quote see
But it's a lot of the same theory too
Instead it's just a matter of
Instead of directing
Going directly into the nerve, it's a matter of
Providing a projection
A display that can be
Recognizable to people
With that level of vision
So yeah, that makes sense
Kaijuto in the chat room says 800 Microsoft points
If you want to keep seeing past three months
That's wrong, that's just wrong
They do say that the goal is to bring
In the glasses at under a thousand
Pounds each, because remember this is being
Researched at Oxford University
But still, I mean, you know
That sounds really expensive, but
For a piece of technology
That you would use
Everywhere every day
That actually does not seem so bad at all
And pretty affordable
That's pretty awesome
Misty in our chat room at chat.onorsonshadeo.com says
Hey, pew pewing QR codes is fun
You know, there is
Something about those QR codes
Like, they're all ads for something
But yet, she's right
There's something about scanning those codes
It's kind of fun
But I'm just saying, why not
Really give those codes a real practical
Purpose that could actually better society
Rather than just giving URLs to websites
And things like that
Actually, put them up for events
Yeah
With a lot of the stuff that we do now
On school for advertising
We actually include the QR codes for the charity events
For, like, student council
Stuff
So they use them a lot in terms of
Passing along event information
And I actually find them a lot of times
Oddly enough, on Japanese blogs
Interesting
They've been having to scan the code
Things for forever
Mobile phones have always been more advanced
Over there. It isn't until we got the iPhone
When finally
They started looking at our phones
Going, hmm, we like that
But for the longest time, they were far more fast
Remember the after years? Final Fantasy 4, the after years
And the Wii? That was originally a mobile phone game in Japan
Well, and keep in mind too
Is that cellular networks are cheaper
Than landlines
Overseas
So it ended up becoming a much
Better market to develop
As opposed to people here
I still like my rotary phone!
I like the noises
I do like my rotary phone
But it's not as good
As having to actually call the operator
And ask to be put through
To, you know, Mrs. Cleaver
Although, you know, if people go to Geek Life
And click the link
For ThinkGeek
You can buy
A handset for your iPhone
A rotary phone style
Handset for your iPhone
You can also buy bacon mince on ThinkGeek
Yes you can
Anyhow
But follow the link
Anyway, but back to
Are we gonna get a kick back
For that little plug you just sent?
Maybe
But back to the point
I mean
It really has to do also with how far
Society itself is willing to advance
Keep in mind
I'm gonna use an old comparison here
Betamax and VHS
If you look at the two side by side
Betamax was the better format
You had a better picture quality
But it went
To VHS because of funding
Because that's what got the push
You know, it's that way with any
Technology, it depends on what's
Got the backing behind it
Where you're, say that you live in Japan
And it's better to have a cell phone service
You know
Then, obviously
That's where the money is, that's where people are gonna push the technology
But here, for the longest time
It was all landlines
Cell phones were novel, you had that big brick
In your car, you know
But now it's kind of turning around
Like, you know, Dan and I don't have a landline
God, I remember my parents' first cell phone
Like that fucker mounted in the
Middle of the car
And it was this giant handset
It looked like it was connected to a car battery
It looked like it caused cancer
No, we went to a trip
Coming back from
Washington one time when Dan's dad
Had his wedding
Soon after I moved out here
So we're talking about, you know
Late 90s
And it looked like a phone attached to a car battery
You know what I mean?
Yeah, it really did
Okay, who's seen Kill Bill?
And the phone that Sophie pops out
In the flashback scene
You know, that's what cell phones look like
Yeah, yeah
So
But my point is that it
Really depends on
The market the money is gonna be in
So
God, I met a kid the other day
Didn't know what a VHS tape was
I'm gonna smack him upside the head
I don't know what a VHS tape is
Well, because by the time
This guy would have been 5 or 6
DVDs were out
So what? I didn't, you know
I know what a fucking 8-track tape is
And I didn't fucking see those forever
I think part of it was just trolling
It made me think like
Oh god, you are old enough
Or maybe you only ever know what it is
I don't know what paper is
Paper and pen, I've got a Kindle
Actually, you know, it's funny
Going back to Japan
They had a phenomenon going on for a while
Where people were actually forgetting how to hand write
Certain kanji
Because they were so used to
Well basically, on my iPhone
Whenever I put in anything
Using the Japanese typewriter
I get a lot of words
That are spelled the same way
Actually, I could totally see that happening here
Like, I don't think that's just limited
To the complex written language
Of some of the Asian languages
Like, I
I would think even I am challenged
To sit down, like imagine if I had to sit down
And write a letter in cursive
Like, that would actually take a minute to kind of like
Like, some of the capital letters
You don't write every day
Actually? I take a lot of written notes
But I print, you know
But like, if I had to write cursive
Like, I don't really practice that
I actually do practice my cursive
Do you? You're a nerd
My mother used to
My mother used to sit me down
My mom has gorgeous
Handwriting
I always got F's in handwriting
Your son has Parkinson's
She would make me sit down and practice my handwriting
So to this day
And then when I went and took typography
I had to
Basically what he had us do is start off with glyphs
And then find out once our glyphs got to be a little bit more
You know, just free
Free drawing little glyphs
And once they got to be more complex
Then we said, okay, what letter does that look like
And we'd practice full letter forms
And then pick that and go from there
So it was, it was talking about, you know
How written language evolved
Just, you know, from
Reflex in your hands
My printed handwriting
Got better when I started my job as a corporate trainer
Because I have to write on the whiteboard
All the time
And it's actually kind of embarrassing that my handwriting sucks
Like, and I know, like, I'll be writing stuff on the board
And I'm like, oh god, it looks like a seven year old
Is teaching this class. Practice
But, yeah, well, you know
Well, and I've been doing my job long enough now where it's gotten a lot better
But, I mean, that's the whole point
Is that those handwriting
Skills aren't being focused on that much anymore
So people are forgetting
What should be a basic skill
I mean, a lot of people are actually even forgetting
The origins of their language
Like, I posted something from Crag today about
Words showing up in the dictionary, like, girl
Like, the G-R-R-R-L
And stuff, and
I'm like, those aren't real words
Those don't need to be there. That's slang
The one reason I would want to be an English teacher
Is to say, if you use any text speak in a written paper
You automatically fail this entire class
Well, and
My teacher, my second grade teacher
Was mean
Okay, she was pregnant
And then had her baby, so I think part of it might have been
Now that I'm an adult, it might have been postpartum
Right
But the first half of the semester we had the sweetest lady as the substitute
And then the rest of the year
Ms. Bitch came
Her name was Ms. Bitch
I'm not gonna say it, I still remember her name
But anyway, she used to just walk by
And smack our hands every time we started
Doing a letter form wrong
It's like, no, you're gonna sit and you're gonna start from the beginning
And rewrite the whole thing
But I think people
Are relying too much on their cell phones also
To correct their spelling
How many more
How much more often do you see people doing
T-H-E-R-E
When they mean a possessive there
Oh, right
I think people are relying too much on
Their autocorrect
It goes back to that same thing when I brought up Japan
With people forgetting how to write
You know, even
I was even reading an article the other day about how
A lot of the original
Kanji is actually now brought out in more simplified forms
And people are forgetting how to write the old way
But it's
I think that
Having our computers
And everything do this for us
Is making us all lazier as people
And
People are forgetting something that should just be
Something that you learn in first grade
Alright, OLR listeners
Now if you think maybe your handwriting could use some improvement
Here's a chance
To find a pen and paper
Which might be a chore all in itself
But find a pen and paper
And write down
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Five times every day
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Dark Soccer, you're a design person
Why is that sentence important?
Because it has every letter in the alphabet
Good job
That's also why it's used for typeface samples
But there's a few other sentences
That have everyone
Emma Gray
Which is one of the type foundries that I follow
Has different sample sheets out
That whole like lorem ipsum
No, not the lorem ipsum, different sentences
That have the same letters in them
See, I'm trying to
Integrate the geeky design stuff into the show for you
Thank you, it makes me happy
Throwing you a bone
I had a squee, which is why I was showing you someone
Throwing up rainbows on somebody else
I'll find the picture for the chatroom
Alright, well speaking of throwing up rainbows
Here's some happy music for you
They can always tell you that the classic game of the week is on its way
Every week Dark Soccer goes to the gaming vault
And finds a game that she thinks you ungrateful children should be checking out
Especially if you've never had VHS in your life
Then you probably have missed a lot of these games
I had a Betamax player
I had a Betamax player too, sit down
I had Clue on Betamax, sit down
I had an 8-track player
With a record player attached to it
And transistor tubes
Hold up to the classic game of the week
I had the record player
That was built into the, well my family had the record player
That was built into the shelf
Because the shelf was the speaker, it was so big
And we had Star Wars soundtrack on vinyl
And I wish I still had that today
Because that thing's probably worth a shit ton of money
You know what else I had on vinyl?
Close Encounters of the Third Kind
So I could listen to the, the track was called The Conversation
And I always knew which one it was
Based on how far apart the grooves were
But not only that, I had a record player
That lit up in different colors
When it was turned on
And you would play the Sesame Street records on them
That would read the book to you
And then when you hear the noise
Turn the page, bing!
Oh yeah?
I had a grandma phone, I had to fucking crank that shit
If I wanted something to play
My husband's laughing in the other room
But actually I'll tell you one thing
That I did have
I had an entire set of Voltron
Books on cassette
Black Wolf in Chat says I had reel to reel
Beotches. Dude, when I studied
Communication Design in college, we had to
Learn, like this is just
This is honestly
Should I say this on the radio?
Say it!
I have learned more from doing Orange Lounge Radio in the past
Nine years than I learned in college
Paying thousands of dollars
To attend this communication design program
And that's one of the reasons why I don't think
Me dropping out of college was such a bad idea
And why I think it's bullshit
And employers require BA degrees
And all this stuff
I know it's a controversial opinion to have
But I don't think school's for everyone
It's honestly true because I've seen more people
I've seen people with more talent in their little finger
Than people who've
Got masters in design
Yet they
Because in college
In college we had to learn
How to record to the reel to reel
And we had to learn how to edit
The reel to reel
With fucking tape and a wax pen
Where you listen to the thing and then you have to do
The wax pen to cut out the words
And all this stuff and guess how much
I've used a wax tape
In producing nine years
That last longer than most radio shows
Do on commercial radio
Guess how many times I've used a wax pen
In the nine years of doing this show
Zero
Because the state school
Is not on the cutting edge of technology
But you could get drinks really cheap
I can say this though
The design program at Sac State
Is actually really top notch and some of the people are hiring
Directly from Sac State now
Well I'm sure things have changed and so forth
But I'm just saying
Some people learn best from just being thrown in the pool
And told you better fucking swim to me
Well there's a book I'm reading right now
Which by the way the review should be on Geek Life
In a few days
And I know it's ironic that I'm a teacher now
But there's a big difference
Well but the book I'm reading
Is an autobiography
Of a big name in comics
And again everyone will find out who it is
But it's talking about how he broke into illustration
And comics just by
Drawing all the time and then being hired
Because of his talent because of his skill
And learning how to do
Newspaper editing
And you know
Airbrushing you know in the 30's
By being said
Coach these are your inks
So anyway
I realize my opinion is a little bit controversial
But I just speak from real life experience
I agree with you
I realize some of the people out there may not
And may even possibly be offended but I'm just saying
From my experience in my world
College did nothing for me
But fucked me up emotionally
Well like with the classes I've gone to
I know how to use the programs already
But I listen to my teachers
Who have been working in the field
I want their experience
It's a better thing when you have a teacher that gives you real life experience
Because they're in it
They're doing it
As opposed to oh I got my masters and now I'm gonna teach
You know what I mean
You can tell the difference
But yeah I'm sorry
Anyhow
Oh you know what else I had?
I had all of the Gremlins records that they gave out at McDonald's
With the Happy Meal
I had the record that came free in the newspaper
That sang the song about the
Mac McDLT a quarter pounder with some cheese
Layover hamburger and cheese
How do I remember that song? I remember that fucking song
I had the Fruit Loops one
Rob I had the Fruit Loops one
The one that came in on a square album
In a box of Fruit Loops
It's like a fucking plastic record
I know
I love how we went from throwing up rainbows
You know
You know you're old school when you've had
A warped record and you fixed it yourself
You know you're old school when you know
That the best version of Alice in Wonderland
They ever made was that TV movie in the 80's
With Carol Channing
I know
Back to rainbows
How about some classic games
Well this
I'm taking us all the way back
To 1996
That was before I moved out here
And I must thank my husband
For turning me on to this series even though
I did work for Namco for a little while
But I didn't really give it much thought until
My husband said
This game's awesome we're gonna play it
And it is Soul Edge
Woo
Soul Edge
You got soul
So
This is the intro so we have to play a little bit of the intro
Transcending history and the world
A tale of soul
And swords
Eternally told
Anyway
This game had
We've actually got this soundtrack
It's really cool but anyway
This is from the Playstation version
Soul Blade
Soul Edge is
A 3D fighting game
It was the second one that had characters with weapons
The first being Toushinden
And this
Actually had
Everyone had their different style
Depending on their actual weapon
This came out in arcades in 1996
And then there was
A different version that's called
Soul Edge version 2
That
Was basically a little bit easier because people found
The original to be
Really hard and that you couldn't beat the last boss
Hwang
Was put into
That version as well
He was actually originally a palette swap
Of Mitsurugi in the Korean version
And you could play as Cervantes
Who was the pirate
Who had the Soul Edge
The sword
They also put in air combos
And guard impacts
And everyone had upgraded moves
It came out like I said on the Playstation
As Soul Blade
And uh
It was
That's Cervantes music
I love that song it's so cool
But anyway everyone had their own little
Hold on let me let the listeners have a
Peek at this music real quick cause
I will say one thing I love
One thing I love about these games is the
Soundtracks I mean they're just
Amazing here we go little clip
But yes oh that's actually
I think my favorite piece in that game
That's the arranged version by the way from the
Playstation version
Cause the Playstation versions had arranged
Soundtracks as well as the original
Soundtracks so it was really cool
Nice
At any rate
It basically you could move
Your character all along
Their little
Stage area
And you had borders around the stage
If you fell off of your little stage
Then that was you know you'd die
It's kind of hard though to jump off the stage
Your jump was
Actually kind of
Not really so much of a jump
But some characters had better jumps
There was also
A weapon gauge
And it had your weapons resistance on it
And
When you would block an attack your bar would
Deplete and if it emptied you would lose
Your weapon
And then you'd have to finish the match unarmed
So basically like
Oops my sword broke oh crap
And
There were also
Locking moves too so you'd have to
Press the button you know at the right time
And see who could get out of it
Everyone had
One or two unblockable attacks
Which actually came from the Tekken series
And
It was really hard to pull them off
So that kept it pretty balanced and then
You had critical edge attacks
That were long
Like a long series of different links
Kind of like have you ever played in Tekken
When you used King's throws it was kind of the same deal
But then
There were
Different combinations of
Different attacks that would you know have
A special sequence
So on top of that it would also
Deplete a third of the weapons gauge
When you used it it was the ABK attacks
It had
Aggressive block which was called guard impact
That would
Give you a free counter attack
And then you also had like I said earlier
A ring out
You can't just jump out of the ring you have to be thrown out of the ring
The game
Itself according to
Namco
Took place in 1584
And it's warriors searching
For the soul edge
It had different names but it was pretty
Nasty
Anytime someone had it bad crap happened
So it had all kinds of
Different characters you had Siegfried
You have Mizurugi
You had Tamara
You had Taki who was your ninja girl
Voldo oh Voldo
He was Mr. Bondage boy
His weapon was a
K-tar
The hand mounted blade
And he wore lots of
Strappy leather
I'm sure some of us recall
And then there was
Like
Sungmina
And then there was a character added
Who was in Soul Blade
As a secret character
It came out on
Playstation on December 20th
1996 in Japan and it came out
In 97 in the USA and Europe
And it kept all
The soul edge version 2
And 5 unlockable characters
Including the soul edge
The boss of the game
Had arcade mode versus mode, survival, team battle
Time attack and training
Had an RPG mode called
Edge master mode
So you could basically
Go through a story had it like they were
A character in a book so it was kind of neat
And you had
Extra versions of different weapons
That had more power, more strength
More durability and like I said
Also you had an arranged soundtrack
And the arcade soundtrack
And then you had the
Khan super session
Which that's the album that we have
Is the Khan super session that
This band, their stuff
Is really really good stuff
So it is
Probably one of the best
Fighting games ever
I think
I think a lot of people have a lot of love for this game
I gotta admittedly I didn't get into this series
Until Soul Calibur 2
The arcade version
Which still is like one of my favorite
Gamecube games they ever made
That's actually from I just noticed this intro
That we're listening to the music off of
The Japanese intro
Because they had to put clothes on
Sofotia
And the scene where she's in the water
And Hephaestus is coming out of the water to talk to her
She's naked in the Japanese version
They had to put clothes on her in the American one
Which is
Redonkulous
And she's got her hands over her boobs so what's the big deal
Alright
Anyhow there it is your classic game of the week
Soul Blade or Soul Edge
Whatever you want to refer to it as
Alright
That's gonna do it for part A of our show
But don't go anywhere we've got plenty more to come
Looks like it's gonna be a long show tonight
Including some rapid fire news when we get back
Twitter topics! Get your tweets in
Twitter.com slash OLR
You got about 5 more minutes to get those in if you're listening live
On Sunday nights
And some more news stories and of course your calls
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
Don't go anywhere, we'll be back after this
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
We are live here
On this July 10th
2011 with episode
Number 419 of our show
Which you know means next week is episode
420
Not that any of us are gonna
Do anything outside of the norm for that
Week but I just thought it was worth saying
That some of our listeners will be
But anyhow, just throwing that out there
Usually at this part of the show
We want to plug a couple of the
Side projects and other things that we're working on
I do want to go ahead and work in
One other plug quickly for the
Understation Live 10th anniversary show
That is going to be this coming Saturday
I know I'm going to be there and
Jessica Harper will be there
And we're going to be reminiscing about the good old days
At Understation Live
The show where I started
On internet radio
Although I guess you could say
I did internet radio in college but
You know, again, wax tapes
So it really started
On Understation Live
Back in 2001
Also, Hoard House is the show I do
About the world of Warcraft with my buddy
Xtopher, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth
If you are a Warcraft fan you really should check it out
www.hoardhouse.com
I got really angry on this week's show
And it has to do with getting booted from a pug
And it occurred to me
I don't know if you saw my reply to a post
On our private guild's forums
But that night I was so mad
I think you said something to me
DarkSakura, and I was like, this game can suck
My fucking dick, good night
It didn't occur to me until like two days later
I was like, oh god, did she think I said that to her?
Because I wasn't saying that to her
You said some acronym
That I didn't understand at the time
Oh
And then afterwards I was like
Oh, that's what it is
Because you said VTK'd
And I was like
Oh, vote kicked, yes
They VTK'd me
But I was like
My reply I remember was
What? And they were like, this game can suck my dick
I'm going bye
And I'm sitting there just staring at my computer
Going
Who's gonna play with me now?
I had a diva moment
Where I stormed off the set
Seriously, that's exactly what it was like
And I'm like, seriously, I sat there for ten minutes
I had time for my character to go
On away, and sit down, and pout
Aww
But I mean, I was like, I was trying to figure out what's going on
So I started looking it up online
I was emotionally raped by a guild
On another server with that vote kick
Do the troll dungeons link to other servers?
Oh yeah, they all do
I didn't know about that
Oh yeah, they all do
So be careful
Oh no, I was just gonna say
Speaking of voting the kick
Prior to the mods being patched on Grand Theft Auto
When we were playing just regular
Private matches
My co-workers usually tried to vote to kick me out of the game
Because I'd be kicking the crap out of them
I was like, vote him out
He's beaten
That's ignorant that somebody would vote kick
Just because they're good
They think it's funny
That's what I keep telling myself
That I couldn't just handle my beauty
So that's why they had to vote kick me
More information on that at Hoardhouse.com
We told you about the stupid bitch we had
In one of your groups?
Oh yeah, something like
They didn't want to heal the tank
We'll tell the story really quickly
We were at Grim Butthole
Sorry, Grim Butthole
But it's Grim Butthole
Because it sucks
We kind of wanted to skip the harder battles in there
Because they're a pain in the ass
And it's like
I just want to run through this really fast
I don't care about anybody else
And then she starts getting really foul
And then she's like
Let's vote to kick the tank
And I'm like, bitch no
I was like, do you read that all of us
Are in the same guild and you're not?
See, you should have vote kicked her
I started, I did
I requested a vote kicker three times
And it didn't pass?
It did on the third time
Because it did that delay
I was not a rude cunt
So there's a big difference
But she was, she was
I've got screen capture, she was that bad
And, okay
I'm going to tell you something everybody
And it doesn't matter if you're on World of Warcraft
Or whatever MMO that you're on
Be nice
You don't get anything from being a bitch
Or, you know
Blaming everything on the tank
Or a troll
There's so many trolls in WoW
And it's really like
What do you really get
This is masturbation for you
I can't think of anything else that
Trolling accomplishes other than
Jacking yourself off
I'm going to give a few pieces of advice
Now this is a little more specific
To WoW
I will repeat these later on for you
In a recorded version if you like
Rule number one
Don't be a dick
Rule number one of the OL army
Which I know we don't talk about that a lot
But you know we do have a steam group
We do have several gaming groups available online
You know with all the steam sale orgy stuff
Going on right now, if you're not in the OLR group
I don't know what you're doing
Cause the rule number one of the OL army
Is don't be a dick
And so you know you should come join us on steam
And more information is at OrangeLunchRadio.com
In that little extend play box on the left side
Well number two refers to how you treat your tank
It's a three strike rule
Number one
If your tank doesn't flat out say
I've never tanked this before
And they're doing a bad job, stop and explain the mechanic
To them if you happen to know it
If they still act shitty
Give them one more try and if they are just
Derpy say sorry
We need you to leave
That really doesn't just apply to tanks
I think that can go for anybody
In any MMO, it doesn't even have to be WoW
And sometimes people make mistakes like
I started using, you know when you hit V and the little life bar show up
I accidentally targeted
A creature in a group over
Because the little name tag
Was like right next to the one I was targeting
And so I made a boo boo
But I you know went and reshaped everybody
And everyone was happy
But it's just like
Don't point fingers
Don't lay blame
If someone is truly bad
A good party will hold them through it
If they are being bad on purpose
Then say sorry you need to practice this one
A little bit more, play with your guildies for a bit
Because I played with
I will not be in a party unless there is one other guildie with me
I just won't do it
I did it once though on my first troll heroic
But anyway
My third rule
If you are not on your game
You need to step back
Don't blame somebody else
For what you are doing wrong
Like for example I will use me from the other day
I was getting motion sick after
While you were playing with us
And we were an all guild group
And when we got people from outside
The guild after you had to log off
Because you weren't feeling well
I had to stop playing because I couldn't take breaks
Because I was getting motion sick
Or if I'm having a bad night
I'll say you know what I'm just not into this
I'm going to have to back out because I'm holding everyone back
You need to be able to say
To take enough responsibility on yourself
That you're not going to ruin somebody else's good time
So those are
My three rules for playing with other people
Words of sage wisdom
From an OMG real life girl
Yes
Speaking of MMOs
I can't remember if I told this story last week
So stop me if I'm repeating myself
I'm getting old and I forget an old age
Salacious Pop did a really big troll on me
Because of the Steam sale that's going on
I was mentioning just off hand something about
I wonder what Final Fantasy 11
Is like these days
You know gosh I'd be really curious
What's going on in 11 these days
Steam you have been gifted
A copy of Final Fantasy 11
The complete Uber edition
Including the new Abyssia expansion
It's 11 bucks
I know I look over at Alan
And I go like you're such a fucking troll
So
That is actually downloading at home right now
Not that I'm going to log in and play right away
But yeah
I do have 30 days of that that I can check out at some point
Oh mine finally finished I downloaded
Champions
Oh you downloaded Champions the free
You know what
If someone gave me $11
So I could get Final Fantasy 11 Rob I would play with you
Just to see
How lolsy it is now
But somebody has to give you
$11 good luck on that
Or just send it to me on Steam
It's so easy now
Alright
Dan's in the other room saying no more momos
No more momos but it's only 30
Days Dan
That's
He's yelling
That's how Warcraft started
And then he goes fucking Rob
Yeah I know I know
Alright let's move on
We need to do some rapid fire news
And talk about some other stuff going on
Instagaming world
Loki
Speaking of Final Fantasy
There's a Final Fantasy game coming to the 3DS
Although this may not be the Final Fantasy game you're looking for
It's Final Fantasy
Um
Why did I have to make these like really ridiculous
Fake names
The rhythm I guess
The rhythm
It's like theater rhythm mixed together
Anyways
It is a rhythm
Game for Final Fantasy
So your combat is done
The kind of
Rhythm stuff
Now Cloud can dance like never before
Funny that you should mention Cloud
Because actually I think I see someone
In that picture that looks very similar
I'm just imagining Bust A Move songs
In my head with the characters replaced
With uh
Cloud and it's really funny to me I don't know why
Um yeah it looks kind of neat
I like rhythm games I like Final Fantasy so maybe
I check it out but um yeah I mean for
People looking for like a Final Fantasy RPG
That's brand new and everything
Um not quite what you're looking for here
So but I check it out
Looks kind of neat
New fanboy worlds colliding
Pretty much yeah
And then on top of that Harmonics is of course
Working on a new IP called Vithrhythm
And that's literally all we know about that
Um
They've just confirmed yeah there's something that we
Can add to it at this time but
Yes we are working on that project
So maybe a new
Res type game or something like that
That'd be kind of neat we'll see
Um
And then finally this is kind of neat
Rockstar is um
Trademarked uh Rockstar Films
And um
Apparently you know one of the
People are thinking hey you know what uh
They did mention one time that if someone was gonna
Make Grand Theft Auto into a movie
That it would it would be them
Um you know
They said that they would be the ones that would want to
Handle that um
So maybe we'll see some movies coming from
Actually you know I could see something like
Uh you know maybe like LA Noire
Or something like that as a movie from them
Cause um you know it's a little bit more
Of a linear story
Grand Theft Auto would be a little bit kind of crazy
I don't know if they could do that but um
Neat
You know they'd be turning some of their games into uh
Movies
Neat
Which would you rather have first a Grand Theft Auto movie
Or a Red Dead Redemption movie
Cause I would think Red Dead Redemption would make a better movie
I agree that's just me
Of course
Cause usually I beat you here to the show
So I don't see your car pull up
A whole lot but tonight I was late thanks to an accident
So um I pull up behind
You and I never realized you had a license plate frame
That said I'd rather be playing Grand Theft Auto
Yes I got that a few months back
It's nice
Alright uh some other quick
News here uh an interesting spinoff
Of the Burnout series that's coming to
Xbox Live Arcade, Burnout
Crash apparently is coming out
By interesting you mean terrible
The thing that's interesting about it to me
Is it's that whole like top down look
It looks like
Remember
Ivan Ironman Stewart's
Super Offroad
That every round table pizza
I guess that's a west coast thing but every pizza
Joint I guess across the nation had
In their little arcade that game was
Fucking bad ass
Yeah this looks like one of those type of
Games but it's fucking Burnout so I don't
Actually this looks kind of rad
I didn't look at the trailer so let me
Let me look at the trailer cause maybe it is kind of poopy
If I see it in motion
Well they have two different trailers
What the?
No I do not like the look of freshly colored hair
Yes see that's the thing about joystick
Is they always have commercials for like
Hair products for like women
That is like the such wrong demographic
I can't wait until I see a douche
Commercial come up
That and like you know hey
Your children are visiting the internet
They could use AOL's blah blah blah
To lock down the internet for them
Do you have Rampant Vaginitis?
I don't know if
This trailer is going to show gameplay cause they had a
Teaser one that didn't have any gameplay in it
But the gameplay trailer
Or a little preview
Not good
Let me do the YouTube thing instead of like trying to go to a
Gaming news website I'll just go direct to YouTube
But anyways
Crash time it's
Basically you know the crash mode
That they had in the other games
Which hey you know what if they wanted to bring that over
Into it's own game and make it look like the regular
Burnout games but just be all the crash mode
I'd be fine with that
This is an Xbox Live Arcade game right?
It also supports Kinect
Notice the hopping up and down icon
Right there yes in order to make cars explode
You have to hop up and down
I can turn that bullshit off right?
Oh fuck it I won't play with that
Blow up the pizza truck
This looks like Super Sprint mixed with
Burnout I think this is actually kind of rad looking
Of course there's not a lot going on right now
This would be better if they were like actually driving faster
Or something It's got fire
Instead of just causing like a 20 car pileup
Well that's the point see the car pileups
Or whatever in the destruction it causes
Your little meter to build up
And then you can explode your car Oh that's like
There was a mode like that in one of the older Burnout games
Yeah crash mode that's what this is based off
But that's the thing though
I really wish it was in that format
And not necessarily this because the
Kinect functionality they have it where you drive the car
Like you make the 10 and 2
Steering wheel motions or whatever
And then you have the hop up and down to make your car explode
Which I hate I played that racing game
It's terrible
Just don't like it anyhow
One game I do like is Torchlight and Runic
Games announced that Torchlight surpassed a million
Units sold
This would be across the PC the Mac and the 360
They haven't said how much on what system
But considering it has been discounted on Steam several times
I'm pretty sure that helped
Just like it helped sell Lady Gaga
A million albums when Amazon sold it for 99 cents
Anyhow
Runic is right now
Working on Torchlight 2
They are still targeting 2011
For the launch but they won't allow
Announce a release date until Runic
Is closer to being done
You can tell that the employees were from
Blizzard a big chunk of them because
Blizzard does that same damn thing where it's like
It will come out when it's ready
Kojima Hideo Kojima
Of course known for the Metal Gear
Series but also known for
A series that was popular in Japan
Snatcher which kind of has a cult following here
Announced
On the latest edition of his Hideo
Radio podcast
Apparently he is going back
To something he had announced
Several years ago but nothing ever came of it
He's basically re-announced that
A radio drama
Inspired by the 1998
Cyberpunk game Snatcher
That's been scripted by Suda51
Called S.D. Atcher
It's kind of a spin on
Suda51's name
This is the team up
Project S thing
It's a radio drama
It will be released to coincide with the 300th
Episode of Hideo Radio
And Akira Yomoka is going to be doing
The music
Judging by the fact that they're on episode 296
Now you'll be able to find this episode
300. They come out bi-weekly
So 300 will be in about what
2 months?
Kind of interesting
I'm sure
Snatcher fans will be very happy to hear that one
Quite
Dark Sakura
In other news we do have
Some costumes for LittleBigPlanet2
The Final Fantasy 7 pack
There's going to be
From what I can see on here we have
Aerith, who cares, Tifa
We have Vincent, yay, Cloud
And Sephiroth
Well if you have Aerith you can just jump her off a cliff over and over
No, if you've got Aerith you just have to
Stab her over and over
Or just hold the square and watch her head explode
Because remember in LittleBigPlanet2 you can explode
Your little guy
That, okay, that makes it worth it
The Sephiroth one's kind of funny
Looking for the record
And then, now I actually
Saw the trailer for this
In the theater
For Tekken Blood Vengeance
And I was like this looks really cool
I'm going to see that
It does look awesome
It is a one night only US showing
That's going to be before the Japanese release
By a little over a month
And it has 20 minutes of interviews with the Tekken staff
Including
The screenwriter
Dai Sato
He also was behind Cowboy Bebop
Is this going to be one of those horrible
Live events at the theater things
That you always see the commercials for
Like the whole like, see Coldplay
Take the stage at Madison Square Garden
At your local theater
It is like one of those
No, you get to see the movie
No, no, I know, I know
Don't you ever see the commercials at the movies
For these things that are like
Well those are Fathom events
A night at the Metropolitan
And they are going to be doing
It is the same thing
It's very limited theater
They've done other anime
Things like they did the Death Note movie
And the live action Death Note movie
And stuff like that
Rob, we went to see Escaflowne
I didn't go to that
I thought you went with us to see Escaflowne
I remember a bunch of people went to that
I've never seen it
They'll probably do this with the Try Again movie when it comes out
I also saw, you know
I've seen a bunch of movies
Like I saw Perfect Blue in the theater
You went to see Perfect Blue with me, that was it
No, I didn't have seen that either
I don't think, there's not a lot of animes I've seen in the theater
I saw Howl's Moving Castle
You've seen Requiem for a Dream, haven't you?
No
But that's like Salacious Pop's favorite movie
Yeah, but the guy was a fan of the director of Perfect Blue
Oh
Yeah, anyway
He actually fully ripped a scene from it
There's totally a new Studio Ghibli film coming out in a couple weeks in Japan
I had no idea
There's actually one that just came out already out there
But I want it to come out here really desperately
It's called Kurigurashi no Arieti
Which is the borrower
Arieti from the books The Borrowers
I think that's, no that's not it
A little tiny girl
Like the Littles
And they live in this old house and this sick boy goes live there
And he makes friends with her and everything
But the soundtrack is done by
A Breton singer
Anyway, I'm sorry, I'm digressing
But no, this is
I'm gonna see the movie
I really wanna see the movie
Because I am a huge Tekken fangirl
But it's all CG
So it's gonna be really cool
And it's gonna be on July 26th
And then it will be six hours
Of gorgeous Tekken
Gooey mess
You know what, for OLR's 10th anniversary show
I think we should hook up with Fathom Events
And make it a one night
In the theater special
And Dark Soccer will just have to deal with being on the big screen
I don't know how expensive that is
But I know that they do that for riff tracks
Do they?
It's expensive, but I think it's moderately expensive
Okay, OLR me
Call your local theater and demand the
OLR 10th anniversary special
To come to Fathom Events
I'll have a mask made
That would be weird
I don't know
We're packing theaters alright
You hear what person?
Now that we've sat you down
And you've paid $10 to come see
Our big mugs in your local movie theater
We thought, what should we do that's special
For this 10th anniversary show
Ferret Vision 3D
So we're gonna have Extrofer bleaches asshole
Live right in front of you on the camera
Who will have an X rating?
It'll be made X for
Extrofer's bleached asshole
It'll be like the time that Katie Couric got her colonoscopy
On the Today show, come on
Anyway, in other news
Resident Evil
HD versions are gonna be coming out
On Xbox, on Xbox 360
We will have Code Veronica
X and Resident Evil 4
And they will have a thousand
Achievement points, ooh
So
Yay
But it's going to have
Here's some of the achievements for Code Veronica
There's The Terror Begins, Escape from the
Graveyard of Terror, A Change Father
Liberate the Change Man
There's Once for Encountering Former Stars Captain
So basically it's stuff that happens in the game anyway
Um
And uh
Actually, there's a comparison up
Of the uh
You just have to look around on the internet, but there's a
Comparison between Resident Evil 4
The original, and uh
The HD version
Since I don't have my GameCube hooked up anymore
Or my, I mean I can always use the Wii, but my friends
Borrowed Resident Evil 4
Like, I'm actually really interested in this
Cause unlike some people in the room, I really liked
Resident Evil 4
I didn't dislike Resident Evil 4, but I loved Code Veronica
And I liked the second one best
Ah, alright
Because the two that were supposed to look like
Leonardo DiCaprio, totally got killed
Akuma JP in the chat room
Is asking, will I be able to save
Yes
You just will not be able to erase those saves
As long as you have enough typewriter ribbon
That's the
Perfect answer, DarkSakura
Perfect answer
I'm actually going to link the articles in the chat room
So people can watch the comparison
Amazing
Tweet time! Twitter.com slash
OLR if you want to send us your tweets
As our listeners do every week
And we will go through some of those tweets right now
And uh, let's see
First off, I want to do a tweet
From Mad Gear Store
Who tweeted a bunch of people
Who did a nice game selection in California Extreme
And tweeted us a picture of some of the
Um, Bamani that was going up there
And I gotta say, I'm actually kinda sad
I'm actually, well I'm not kind of sad
I'm really sad that actually I missed California Extreme
It just, it was just on a bad
Weekend this year, I had a lot going on
This weekend you guys
And I think the others did too, and it's just hard
I could have gone this morning
But I couldn't have justified paying
30 bucks and only being there about 4 hours
Which is what would have happened
So I would have wanted to be there yesterday
Like all night long
So, unfortunately I couldn't make that happen
Blue Swim tweeted us earlier in the week
Going, I usually listen to podcasts
As I'm going to sleep
Had several episodes of OLR playing
And I ended up dreaming about them
Is that creepy that people like dream of us
We didn't hear what was in the dream
Hopefully it wasn't an erotic dream
I dare not
I don't think it was
Redertainment sent a tweet earlier
I actually responded to it, but I wanted to bring it up
On the show, and Redertainment asked
So when are you going to incorporate
Google Plus into the show
This is the new social network everyone's talking about
We like to be on the cutting edge
Of those types of things
As soon as we find a way
To do it, we will
Google has actually asked that small and medium
Businesses stop making personal profiles
Because they will roll out
A business thing, kind of like how
Facebook has business pages
They're going to roll that out later in the year, I guess
So as long as we can do it for free
Or like, really cheap
We're going to look at doing something like that
Where we can keep our fans posted
Assuming that Google Plus has something you want
And you know, we're gamers like you
And if this whole thing ends up being
Spam, spamity, spam, spam
We wouldn't do that, we're not going to contribute to that
But, you know, if it's a place where you can
Be in a community and talk about games
And, you know, meet other people that don't want to be
Jerks on playing online games
Then I'm all for that
But Google Plus, its biggest
Problem right now is that there's not
A lot there, like you can see
What they're building, and a lot of people
Are really liking what they see in the foundation
But there's certainly a lot of other people
Who look at Google Plus and go
There's fucking nothing there right now, it's so vanilla
So, I think
Google Plus just needs some time to grow
And then we can really see what we can do with it
Uh, mnziba
Are you alright there?
Are you alright? Is a bug attacking you?
Is a fly attacking you for massive damage?
Hit its weak point
There you go, she got a Kleenex
And hit its weak point
Squished it to death
I broke one of its wings
Yikes, mnziba sends us a tweet
Saying, this video made me go back to
FFXI or Final Fantasy 11
How many of these scenes have you seen in game?
So I'm looking at a little
A little scenery
A little quaint scene
Of plants growing
I don't know what this is
It's supposed to be like a garden, I gotta skip ahead a little bit
I think it's just some of the
Pretty shit in game
Sent to pretty music
You know what?
I gotta say, it's funny
You know, you sent this tweet before I told my story
At the top of the break about how I got FFXI
Bought for me, but it actually was
Thinking about a lot of the great scenery
And ambiance in that game
Despite the dated graphical technology
That had me thinking like
I wonder what it looks like now
I wonder if they've made some changes
And why FFXIV was so fucking disappointing
Because it should have been
11 improved in high def
But instead it was 11
Flushed down a toilet in high def
And that was what was very disappointing about it
Redertainment sent us another tweet saying
I'd like to start the rumor that the PlayStation 4
Will feature Body Movin', the hit song
From the Beastie Boys
Get it? Because it rips off the connect
Get it?
Spazernator tweets us and says
No news on free PlayStation Network videos
For a while with the fact that my system being
Dead and needing to be repaired
Yeah, I heard about this, I guess he got the yellow
Lie to death on the PlayStation
And he does not have good luck with PlayStation
Yet he supports someone
I know, rude Sony
Rude, rude Sony
Sj100matt tweets us
Has Hollywood really run out of ideas?
The Space Invaders movie rights
Have been optioned
And tweets us to a story
I thought this had already happened some time ago
But it's making the rounds again
The Taito classic arcade game
Space Invaders has been optioned
By veteran Hollywood producers
The film rights were optioned by
Lorenzo de Beneventura
Who made Transformers, G.I. Joe
and Salt and Odd Lot
Entertainment who is behind
Upcoming movies Drive and Ender's Game
I guess they've
Also optioned Asteroids
Ah, I see
Last year Warner Brothers allegedly
Was seeking the Space Invaders rights itself
But that venture fell through
Where would you make a fucking
Movie out of Space Invaders?
Like, wouldn't it just be Independence
Day but called Space Invaders?
Yes, they're never gonna make a better alien
Film than Independence Day
But the soundtrack would be
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
No, well, the new Space Invaders game
Has had fucking rad soundtracks
Like, that would be cool
How about techno rave version of Independence Day?
There you go
Today is our Independence Day
Ooh, ooh
DJ Rama S sent us a tweet
About Pac-Man to become a reality show
Didn't this come up on last week's show?
I have a little question mark over my head
I guess I'll quickly read this
But I guess Pac-Man is coming to life with a new
Reality series
Merv Griffin Entertainment is developing an unscripted show
About the pellet eating yellow blob
Chased by Inky Binky Pinky and Clyde
It's to coincide with the 30th anniversary
Of the video game
It's a big, crazy, wipe out
Type event with a lot of energy
The idea we have is to take what Pac-Man
Is and bring it to life
To bring what is essentially the world's biggest game
Of tagged television
Sounds like a game show
They say a reality show
Like a game show
I consider Wipeout a game show more than a reality show
You know
At first when I read the headline
Pac-Man to become a reality show
Now I hear Pac-Man to become a game show
And if it's done right
It might actually be kind of cool
Isn't there some show coming to NBC
Like take the money and run or something
That's supposed to be like people have 48 hours
To hide $100,000
And if they can keep the money
Hidden from the feds for 48 hours
Or something like that like actual federal agents
That try to chase them down and the money
For themselves because the fed agents are competing
For the money like if they can find it in 48 hours
And they get to keep it and I'm like that
Sounds kind of awesome like
I like shows about like
That type of stuff I would do that
You would do how would you hide the money
How would you win that show
You package it up
Send it second day air
To somewhere
To your house or something like that
But couldn't the federal agents like trace
Everywhere you've been and your steps
And the packages you've sent
You immediately invest it
You immediately invest the money
Well I'm sure there's rules
You probably have to physically hide the money somewhere
I'm guessing
I don't know it's just something
Like capturing the concept of the show
But I don't know it sounds kind of awesome
There was another show I don't think it was out here
But I think it was in um
Britain or something called Jailbreak
That was just about like whoever could
Escape from jail first won like
Obscene amount of money
And who's seen too many Steve McQueen movies
I'll tell you what I'm
Look I'm a game show addict
I grew up on like old school match game
And USA network game shows like Scrabble
And pressure luck and all that shit like
That shit was awesome
But I'll tell you my favorite reality
Game show they ever did
Ever ever it's not
Survivor it's not Big Brother I think the best
Like reality game show they ever did was The Mole
When it was hosted by Anderson Cooper
Like back in the day it was like a fucking
James Bond game yeah it was like
Ten players yet one of them
Fred Savage would show up with a mole on his face
No no not that kind of mole I know
But one player was working against the other
Players they brought it back for a revival
Series a couple years ago but it wasn't as good
Well then they had the celebrity mole and then they had another
Real mole but it wasn't as good cause Anderson Cooper
Like made that show
Cause he's just the man but it was like James Bond
And I would like
I'd kill someone to be on that
Show not literally I'd kill a fly like
Dark Soccer just did I'd do that I didn't just
Kill it Rob I squished it and pinched it
You torched it I hate
No I hate flies and now keep in mind I usually comfort myself
By saying they'll die in two days anyway because
They have a really short lifespan but this
Fly has been buzzing all over my damn house
So I have a feeling of accomplishment
And satisfaction and damn it I deserve
Twinkie
Alright we have a lot of
Fucking tweets today but I gotta get through some of these
Others okay Sturlock tweets us and now
Remember I said I wanted to hear from blind gamers
Sturlock I know is a blind gamer and tweets
Us about the whole glasses story from part A
The glasses thing is actually pretty neat
Don't have enough usable vision
For that but like the concept so
Unfortunately you know it's not
Gonna work for everybody but
It's still cool that it will help
Some people I think that's still really cool
And I think Sturlock sees that too
Tigerclaw305
Tweets us saying
Katamari creator working on a different kind
Of MMO
What kind of MMO would the person behind
Katamari Demashi make
Let's see
Tiny Spec a small developer
Founded by former Flickr employees
Wasn't Spec the name of
Pee Wee Herman's dog
In the Pee Wee's Big Adventure movie
Spec
Yeah
I thought you were talking about what was in his pants
Shut up
Announced today that
Takahashi who is
The guy behind Katamari
Demashi moved from Tokyo to Vancouver
To contribute to Glitch
It's web based MMOs
Ooh there's even a trailer let's take a look real quick
You know he actually got hired to design a
Playground
Well yeah I knew he was doing the Playground but
I see
All these people like little avatars
And they're jumping around like
It looks like a 2D
Platformer game
There's something
LittleBigPlanet-ish about this
To me
I'm not saying that's what the game is
It's just
LittleBigPlanet on mushrooms
There was a wheel
And I quickly caught the text
On that and it said booty prize
I said booty
Anyway
It looks a little silly
That's kind of cool
I guess if it's free
I'll check it out but if it's not
I'll have to hear more about it
To see if it's worth it
Here's a question from Tigerclaw
Nintendo researching mobile phone possibilities
That's kind of a big deal
How did I miss that one?
Think about it guys
Let's see
Satoru Iwata responded to a fantastic question
Pitched at a recent shareholder Q&A that began
I own some shares but I do not have any Nintendo products
Basically I think games are a waste of time
And therefore I would like a product that has value
Added to it so that even I would buy one
Let's see
If we had never considered combining a mobile phone
We would be negligent
But on the other hand mobile phones are subject to monthly fees
And we need to consider how well this would fit with game devices
Or how we should balance these aspects
According to this mobile phone companies
Are generally divided by countries
And when running a business on a worldwide basis
We need to consider in what conditions
Can we partner up with mobile phone companies
Around the world
Please understand that we are still researching these areas
I gotta say
No disrespect to the tweet
Or the story or what have you
This sounds like a whole lot of nothing
Absolutely nothing
This sounds like Iwata just completely dodging this question
He didn't want to tell the guy
No we're not doing a fucking mobile phone
He just wanted to give this big answer about
Well if we did that we'd have to do this and this
But it's something we're always looking into
Just say no
So that they'll say oh it's something we may be looking into
But when it comes to actually you know
Talking about games that they're porting over
Oh that no
I had my hopes up
That this was going to be a story about like
I don't know Mario Brothers on my iPhone or something
How silly of me
How silly of me
WatchDragon tweets us saying
Going old school just beat Tyrion
Does anyone remember Tyrion?
Anyone?
It was an epic mega games shooter
From 94
And the minute I saw a screen
I admit I cheat and I googled it because I'm like what is this
And the minute I saw a screenshot I'm like
What a fucking game back when it was shareware
I guess the whole thing was released
In 2007 as uh
Or no Freeware in 04
And the graphics are open license
As of April of 07
That's kind of cool
Where can you download this game? I'll give a shout out
For the download let's see
Uhhhh
Official Tyrion repository
Freewebs.com
Slash world tree games
There you go
One more tweet last tweet
AlphaCananagram tweets us
Did y'all talk about Play for Japan coming out today?
Sorry many distractions on my end today
Actually we didn't it hasn't come up yet
So we should say
That the Play for Japan album is out today
So if you have not checked it out in iTunes
To see if it's something you want to get
And help out a good cause
You probably should do that after the show
Play for Japan is out
That does it for Twitter tonight
Twitter.com slash OLR
Future week back to gaming news
Loki
Sorry distracted by a very very strange
Picture of Katy Perry for some reason
Why is it that she has like
That
I don't understand it that doesn't make any sense
Why is she famous?
She's famous because she's willing
To wear a dress that has
Whipped cream dispensers
On her nipples that is why she is
Famous
I gotta admit she does have some good songs
I feel like she's a better song writer
She does have some good nipples
That makes sense
Nintendo is actually
In line again for another lawsuit
If it's not motion sensors
It's now gonna be 3D
So they are facing a lawsuit over
The 3DS technology mainly the
Screen
Of course a company that you probably never heard of
Before Tomata Technologies
Has a patent suit against Nintendo
Because they have the patent for technology
Relating to displaying stereoscopic images
On screen for viewing with a naked eye
I.e. without glasses
Or other devices
Filed in 2003 grinded in 2008
And of course you know
They've run up
Suits for the Wii Fit
GameCube classic controllers
Control ports etc.
The funny thing about this though is
Nintendo doesn't make those screens
Sharp does
Oops
So Nintendo licensed
The screen technology from Sharp or whatever
Contracted Sharp to put those screens in
Yeah
And some of the people
They were commenting and they were all as expected
Googled Tomata Technologies
Feels the only notable thing that they've ever done
Is sue Nintendo
Once again one of those patent
Sniping
Companies I guess
Patent trolls I feel like patent trolls need a theme
Song here on the show
We'll look into that for the future
Anyhow I am glad I waited
To buy this game because the new version
That's coming out on Playstation Network sounds kinda awesome
It's Castlevania Harmony of Despair
If you don't remember this game
It's the HD Castlevania game that was released
Almost a year ago on the Xbox 360
It's finally coming out to the
Playstation 3
But the good news is your wait may pay off
Because the PSN version of the game
It will come with a new
Local 4 player cooperative mode
Including the 6 player online mode
There's also going to be the beauty
Desire situation desire map pack
And some extra carriers
Carriers, characters that will carry
Whips and other weapons
Julius Belmont and Yoko Belonades
So kinda cool
You know I played the demo
Of this game and I was kinda like
But I have a lot of friends that are really into it
And I think I need to give it a second chance
So I will definitely check it out on PSN
So yeah very cool
Dr. Sakura
In other news
For fans of Nights like me
There is an
OC Remix album put out
It's called Lucid Dreaming
It is a free download
And it has
25 arrangements
And 2 bonus tracks
From Nights
Into Dreams
And it's actually put out as an anniversary release
Because 15 years ago
It came out on Sega Saturn
So it is available at
lucid.ocremix.org
And I am
Going to be downloading the crap out of this when I'm done
You love Nights right?
Oh yeah Nights is fun although it always made me
Motion sick
But yeah it's an overclocked remix
The whole album is overclocked so
OC Remix has been getting
More and more exposure it seems over the years
Didn't they do the remix soundtrack
For the Street Fighter 2
Remix
I think they said this is their 26th album
That they've done
Well yeah but this is
Doesn't this have some type of backing by Sega
Or no this is just a fan thing
I think this is just a fan thing
Oh my bad I thought for some reason it was like an endorsed thing
Well still really cool yeah
No they've done a few fan albums
Like the Final Fantasy 7 one
There was probably several more than one
I think there was a Mega Man one too so yeah I'm not surprised
That's cool
It's under about
And uh
No it doesn't say that
It just says the fan project so
I'll link the website in the chatroom
Alright
Loki
You know
It was a matter of time
We even hinted that this is something
That may happen and sure enough
Sony has announced
Or I shouldn't even say they've announced
It was mainly found out
That they were going to be doing this and then they acknowledged
Yeah we're doing it
There is now going to be a
PlayStation network pass on
First party games from Sony
Basically this is just like the other online
Passes Project 10 dollars
What the fuck you want to call it?
Ripping off people that are buying used
Pass
That will be included starting with
Resistance 3
Basically you have to have this network pass in order to play
Online
If you're buying it used
Since it's a one time use code
And the code has been used you have to purchase it
For an unset amount of money
But I think it's just
Could it be 10 dollars?
It could be 10 dollars
It could be 5 dollars
That's what other companies are doing
I don't like this trend at all
I don't know
It looks like you may be out of luck Loki
It looks like everybody is jumping on board
What makes this notable I'm sure in many ways
We're not talking a third party developer
We're talking fucking Sony's on board
With this
Which is interesting because Sony always made a big deal about how
PSN is free
Yeah it's free if you buy it new
But then
I don't know it's stupid
I'm sorry
It's just like if you use it
They're using the excuse
Well if you buy it used
The developer doesn't get any of that money
No they already got that money when the game was purchased
It's just new
I don't understand
But you should buy all your games new
Oh it's a stupid argument
Just like you buy all your CDs new
Just like how you buy all your clothes new
There's no such thing as a thrift store
Macy's doesn't get money
When you buy that used clothes
At a garage sale
Too bad
Then you need to make your games better
So those people think that it's worth paying
60 dollars for
To drop your prices down
To a reasonable amount
Where people feel it's necessary to buy
I'm sorry
It's just after all the
Bullshit that they've done with other things
I don't know
Why people put up with it
Let me put it this way
If you're still interested in playing this game online
And buying it new is not for you
What I recommend doing is waiting a good year
Before it drops down in price
If that's not good enough for you
It's sucker new
Or just shop around
A lot of people drop the prices of those games
At launch
That entice people to come buy there
And so you may be able to find it
Cheaper than that
Or if you're in the case of me
Which I could give a rat's ass about
Resistance
It's multiplayer
It wouldn't matter to me either way
But once again
I'm just not gonna buy it
I hope Microsoft is smart
And decides not to do this
I hope that they say
Hey you know what
We're not gonna jump on this bandwagon
Because I have a feeling
They're either gonna jump on it
Because everybody else is doing it
Or they're gonna hold strong and say
Hey you know what we don't need to do that
Because it's gonna look really bad
If they do it
Because they're charging for online
And then they're charging again
For you to get access on
Nah I don't know
That's where I'm kind of at with Dark Toa Gak
Because I'm like you know
I understand why you're pissed off at Sony
But I'm a little worried that this is just the first
Of everybody jumping on board with this
Of course I don't buy a lot of games
Used
But I kind of like having that option
Available to me
Especially when they go out of print
It's also rentals
If you're going on Gamefly or something like that
And you want to play the online portion of this
Well you're fucking out of luck
Unless you want to
Pay ten dollars or whatever
Alright
Let's move on
I want to talk to you about a Facebook game
Yes a Facebook game but this is one that's been
Making a lot of heads turned this week
Civilization World finally
Launched on Facebook
How do you like that? Remember how I bitched about how I didn't have an invite?
Well I did get one later that night
So thank you Dark Tetsuya for hooking me up with that
And not even three days later it went public
Which is fine
At least I got to have a somewhat
Early look at it
But yes Civilization World is a new Facebook game
And it's turning a lot of people's heads
Because a lot of people are going
This is a really good game
And it's a Facebook game
I got to be honest
At its core I still feel like
There's a lot of elements that make it very
Facebook-y
Like the whole, hey do you want to get more harvests
In an hour? Give us your money
Do you want to get more culture generation?
Give us your money
Do you want to get extra bonuses and other perks?
Give us your money
So there's a lot of that going on in Civ World
But otherwise there are a lot of
Kind of cool elements to it
One of the things I like about it is a Facebook
Game because I did spend, obviously I spent
Quite a bit of time with it this week
I just neglected to mention it during my gaming week
Because I was pissed off because I couldn't get in today
Because they're having a lot of server issues today
Because I think the game is just too damn popular
I think they're crushing under the weight of the popularity
Of the game
But anyhow
I was playing some of the game, but one of the things I really like about it
Is that you work with a nation
You can join a nation
To kind of better yourselves
And you're supposed to be working with these people
So that you can
Beat other nations and you can get the technologies
You need to advance yourself as a nation
But at the same time
You're kind of against these same people
Because there's also competition
Going on amongst you guys for
Who is on top of your nation
And whoever is on the top of your nation
Gets more votes and a bigger say
To drive the entire nation
So I kind of like that
Whole teamwork with a knife
To your back type of thing
There's something about that kind of gameplay
That's actually really rad
And I think that's the element that this game has
That no other Facebook game has
And why the rest of it
It really has nothing
It's not fucking civilization
I'm sorry, when I played it
It has similar music
And it has the concepts of
Trade, science, agriculture
And culture
Really growing a city
But after that
I don't know, a lot of the similarities
To civilization
Kind of end
I guess you still have the science tree
There's some really weird minigames that have nothing to do with civilization
That doesn't mean I don't like it though
I like it
If I really want to play civilization
I'm going to go back and play Civ 5
You know what I mean?
This isn't going to get me to quit playing piece of civilization
Yeah, it's like
It's a civilization Facebook game
But it's the fact that they've worked so hard on this
And that I think Sid Meier
Is actually involved
I think led to this whole other angle
That Zynga would have never come up with
I'm sorry
Is not capable of
Gaming an invention
Like this right now
Because I think they're just all about
Pushing out
Clones of what's essentially the same damn game
Between the mafia wars
And the sorority wars
And the farmvilles
And the cityvilles
And whatevervilles
So
So yeah, Civ world
The story is that yes
It launched on Facebook
So if you are waiting for an invite
Why wait? Go play
The game may be down for maintenance or something though
But yeah
In some of the reviews I'm hearing
Is that it has a lot of the just one more turn quantities
Of civilization
And yeah, that's kind of true
But there is a point where there isn't a lot to do
But hover your mouse over
Waiting for little bonus
Science outputs and things like that
But I don't know
I think it's better than most
Facebook games I've ever played
You know what's more fun than a Facebook game though?
Emails
And the emails you send to us every week
At mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
Darzagra is gonna dive
In the mailbag right now and read some emails
For us to respond to
We actually got something from
Holly
About the Commercial Felony Streaming Act
So thanks for reporting on this
I've contacted my senator and my congressman
And sent it on to my friends and family
Hopefully if everyone tells them no
We can get this nonsense blocked
Bravo, good job
That's what everybody should be doing
By the way we have a follow up coming later in the show
We'll get to it in a minute
This comes from Rubba
Rubba, who I think added me on Steam the other day
Cool
You had a really good caller last week
Who discussed the kids that were Crestfallen
About the closure of Virtual Magic Kingdom
You also discussed the Star Wars Momo closing
These things are really good lessons
To children and adults alike
They should learn 1. Everything ends
Your dog will die, the batteries won't last forever
And MMOs or businesses will stop supporting it someday
I think this is more for the younger crowd
2. Virtual goods are not goods
They will someday disappear
In an instant when the MMO closes
This is why I find
Placing cash value on gold or items
To be an utter waste of time
Adults still need to learn this lesson
3. You will not always
Get what you want
It's funny that many of today's Americans don't understand this concept
Amen
And on the bright side 4
Something new and shiny will come along
To make you forget about the old MMO
So there we have it
Dealing with loss, bubble economies, humility and optimism
Rubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba
Things will end and your dog
Will die
This is kind of a Debbie Downer email
It's true though
Your email gets a sad trombone
It's true though isn't it?
It is but
It goes back to my old rant about Americans
And this sense of self entitlement
Everyone thinks that
Everyone owes them something and they don't want to
Work for anything and you know what?
Bite my ass
Oh except that's too much effort for you to come to my house and bite my ass
Well what about, well you better be careful
Because there's some creepsters out there who might actually try to show up at your door
And say I'm here to bite your ass ma'am
I'll kick her in the balls
What if it's a girl?
I'll kick her in the clit
Alright
That hurts kind of bad
I would imagine
Anyhow wow I just didn't think you'd say that
But what about, okay what about the whole angle of
But I paid for stuff in the game
And yeah I realize the address is in the email
But I don't know like
I can see the disappointment if you've actually like put money
And time into this and then suddenly it's like
Oh I've pulled the plug
Well you know what I'll be disappointed and sad when my cat dies
I guess you've poured a lot of money into her
Visits and I've bought that bed down there
And I feed her and I take care of her
But one day she's gonna go
You know I'm very sad I love my cat
But you know
I've, my computer here
I've got all this shit on it
Grandma and grandpa gonna die
But you don't need to tell them that
Cause they already know
I don't know when
I don't know how
But one day they gonna die
But you don't need to tell them that
World of Warcraft
They know already
Yeah but I mean seriously
You know
Your Playstation's gonna break
One day
Ask Spassinator
I know yeah Spassinator should know all about that
Your Xbox is gonna
Be a bed ring
That little beta that you've got
In your pot on your desk at work
Is gonna die
Well aren't we just a fucking
One day your house will burn down
And you won't live there anymore
No but seriously everything
Has an end
Face it
Just because you liked it and it was fun
Including OLR
No
Just because you liked it and it was fun
And you get to have it forever
Grow up
Okay
Last one
And it comes from Robert Mmm
I recently picked up Atari's
Greatest Hits Volume 1 on the DS
First major points off for including
Atari Video Cube instead of Yars
Revenge. The games do
Play very well though and although the small screen
Hurts arcade games such as Gravatar
They control pretty spot on to the originals
I noticed on the back of the box
The proclamation the most popular
Casual games of all time
Interesting. Do you consider retro games
To be casual you know unless you're
Steve Weeby or something
Um
They were just different back then
Interesting. Interesting. I think a lot of retro games
Are just very simple in concept
Were they casual? I think a lot of people
Take a casual approach to it cause I know
When you have emulators
And you can sample everything at the buffet
People will play games for five seconds
I remember this. Next game
I remember this. It's like
It's like you lick the vanilla ice cream
This tastes good. You lick the chocolate ice cream
This tastes good too
But back in the day when you would drop
$50 on those games like they
Entertained you for a long time
Well and I'm gonna
I'm actually gonna use a comparison from
Design theory actually
Okay
Back then first of all
You didn't have a lot of space to actually
Game on so you had to do the most you
Could with the most simple of tools by
Today's standards right?
Also we had a longer attention
Span as people back then
I really think so because today
I mean we're bombarded
With everything and I don't know
If you've looked in a magazine from say
1970
1975
And looked like at an article
For like pantyhose
And it has this big long description
Of why you want to use legs
And all of this stuff
And they really a lot of text a lot of
Information on there and now
An ad is usually just a picture of
A face or a leg
And legs
Buy it
Or if it's like a
Catalog for Abercrombie and Fitch
It's just naked
Good looking 20 year olds
Butts but it's to sell
Clothes and they sell clothes through
Nudity
Where it's like
You pull up a 50's ad for the toasters
And it's like this makes some fucking
Amazing toast and the toast will brown
Just right and Mrs. Cleaver
Loves it and she uses this toaster every day
This toaster really gets my
Toast buttered and I love this toaster
And it's economical and it looks great
In the kitchen
In fact I actually remember recently
Seeing an article for like these
Ugly ass plaid bell bottom pants
In the 70's and it said
Like something
Stretch fiber pants for today's modern
Man these type of pants are for the
Man who wants to get up and put on his pants and
Go and it was really
Describing it you know like you were watching
A TV commercial or something
Well even television commercials now are pretty
Simple to the point you know
Because our attention
To pants are shorter we are bombarded
With so much information
And it just gets to be more
It's gonna be like our photo albums in the future
Are gonna be like from The Last Starfighter
When the dude shows the little square
And it's like 50 million pictures all at once
When dude's got here's my photo
There's them and them
Well wouldn't that just be like one of those digital picture frames
Yeah except it does
A photo a second
Actually I think it did like a photo every half
Second or something but still
The point is is that we had longer
Attention spans back then and I think a little bit
More in the way of determination we were satisfied
With less because back then
That was our big thing
And then it keeps pushing
The envelope and pushing the envelope and now we have
Such high expectations
That
Really if it
You know doesn't hit that
Factor where it's gonna something's gonna change
Every five seconds and hold your attention
That's exactly what's gonna happen you're gonna lose
Interest in it and you're gonna move on
Speaking of which let's get to the next email
There's no more emails
No more
We're out of email
And just like that the mailbag segment
Has died this week
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
If you want to contribute to next week's mailbag
In the meantime let's get to some FUs of the week
I don't really have an FU actually
Ok FU to alcohol for making my face break out
Loki?
I don't have a lot of FUs because I'm coming off a high
Of a really really great weekend
But I will say I did have a really bad day this week
Where just a lot of stuff was going on
Most of it was work related
And then of course everything that I talked about on wow
Like and it's kind of funny
Like I think I took it out on this week's
Episode of Horde House because
You know a lot of my guildies that um
I've been playing with for you know a couple years now
Actually a lot of them listen to the show
And I actually was getting text messages from people going
God you are so cunty on this week's Horde House
And I'm like I was having a bad day
And I got home at 5.55 and the show had to start at 6
What do you want from me?
But otherwise things are fucking fantabulous
And I had an amazing weekend
And I it just it erased the memory of my bad day
Except for the fact that I did remember it to rant about it
But now it's done I'm done
We're not done with the news yet though
We have a few more stories for you guys
And then the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR
Or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio
We're not there quite yet
By the way I've kept Twitter open in another window
And we got another tweet that came in real quick
From Zether77 tweeted us saying
You can also get Tyrion
Cause we mentioned that game earlier on good ol' games
GOG
I was not aware but now I am
I wonder how much I'll have to check that out
Let's get to a couple more news stories for you guys
We talked about last week said that Bill 978
Where it may affect gameplay videos on YouTube and stuff like that
So if you uploaded pictures of yourself playing a game or something like that
And showing the gameplay that that may be considered copyrighted acts
And that you'd be basically slapped with a felony charge
And jail time
Apparently though the way the bill is worded now
They're saying that it's actually may not be the case
Basically the statue can only be enforced in instances
Where uploaders are willfully infringing on the copyright
With the intent to make money
And is only punishable if said uploader makes
Or the game company loses over $2500
And that's probably not gonna be the case for most walkthroughs and stuff like that
Doesn't totally change my opinion
I still think it's stupid
I think this report that you're giving us
I mean don't blame you I know you're getting it from a game blog somewhere
And what folks are reporting on the web
But it's a little bit smoke and mirrors to me
Because I don't think it detracts from the real issue
That okay well where as a lot of individuals
What about the middle man
You know review companies from businesses that are not IGN one up etc
But you know still need those hits
I mean for me this is really bad for small business
Yeah cause I mean they say oh well you know
Unless the company loses over $2500
Yeah but you know these RIA
The RIA said that oh these record companies have lost millions of dollars
From one MP3 download
So you know they can make that shit up
Off the top of their heads
So you know why not say oh yeah this YouTube video of some of the gameplay streaming
That cost us so much money
Or what if you had
How can you prove that a YouTube lost $2500
Exactly
Couldn't a game company say because you gave my game a negative review
We lost all these sales
Everybody that watched your thing was a potential sale
I mean that seems so vague and rude this is a shittily written law
Just like I said last week and yes I used that word last week and I'm using it again
Shittily
Shittily's law
Yeah it's not
Not good
Hey let's talk about origin vs steam and some of the follow ups to that
I teased this a little bit before and after this story we'll get into your calls
A forum post was posted by EA senior vice president of global e-commerce
Saying that gamers should be able to buy EA titles on any site they want including steam
But here's the thing
I guess what happened is that the crisis 2 disappearing from valve service
Was the result of a business deal
Where certain DLC for the game couldn't appear on steam
So valve removed the title completely
Basically valve is like you know because
Valve wants to facilitate all the downloads and patches within its own system
Which for us the consumer I think is really good
That's why a lot of us like steam
But EA is like no we want control of that
So now there's a power struggle going on here
Well anyhow the forum post went on to say that the origin platform is a choice for game buyers
Not an exclusive outlet for all the publishers content going forwards
EA is working to integrate more and more between the game and origin
According to the post
I'm absolutely not at this point saying hey it's origin versus steam
It's never been about that
I don't know if I totally believe that but we'll see
EA wants to continue offering our games for sale on all major download sites
However you say that on one hand and then on the other hand
Didn't they announce that star wars the old republic will only be on the new EA store
So already there is a contradiction in your post
So it makes me a little bit apprehensive to believe anything else you're saying
Anyhow EA posted some digital retailers that are going to be carrying battlefield 3
And guess who's not on it
Yeah it's totally not origin versus steam
It has nothing to do with trying to crack things up
It's because they're really trying to offer download content on their own
And steam is being so bad and not letting them do that
I don't know who to root for in this case
There is a part of me that's like well you know if EA really wants that
Why does steam need that
But I guess that's part of what steam kind of sells itself on
Is that all the patching and stuff goes through us
So if your server goes down EA and the game can't patch
We're not dealing on our promise as steam
I think that makes sense
It does but I am a little bit torn
I also see where EA says but I shouldn't have to every time we want to roll out a patch or something
Get permission from steam to do it
I don't think they need permission but I think that they need to host those files on steam
I think they're just throwing a little hissy fit because they can't make
I don't think they like the fact that steam is taking some of their money for the download content
And they want all of it
Really
I'm sorry go ahead
That's what it sounds like to me
Really interesting feedback in the chat room and check which way this is tilting so far
Let's see Zether in our chat says they aren't putting Battlefield 3 on steam because of the DLC clause as well
Not gonna buy from EA again
Act F says screw EA
Kaijuto says Valve you guys are better than EA tell EA to fuck off
And Randy says agreed fuck EA
And DDR dollar bill says fuck EA
So there's a pretty I mean looking at the fans most people seem to be on team valve
It chatters is anybody team EA?
Curious?
There's a lot of it says or by or um Rama says buy used
Or or I don't think you can buy used PC product really
Or you just go out to the store and buy it
I mean you don't need that digital copy you can just go buy it at a store
There you go or just buy a console version
Some other things on the whole origin stuff
One other thing I want to mention is about the origin is actually coming to the iPod iPhone and Android
There's a cross-platform Scrabble game coming for free to Android
Yay
So I mean that to be fair that is something that steam doesn't do
Steam doesn't deal in the iPad iOS universe right now
There's a part of me though that's like well how does that work because I thought Apple had the exclusive stuff on that
Like I thought you had to do everything through Apple
So how do you launch a new store unless it's like the origin app that has all these mini games that you can buy within it
Like that has to be what it is
Yeah
Right? Interesting
EA did demo the mobile offering the origin Apple let you see your friend list
Which I'm assuming is across the computer and the phone
The accompanying news feed and sharing what everybody is doing on origin no matter what platform that they're on
There's a new version of need for speed on iOS and it was launched from origin
And origin pushes your friend's leaderboard data into the game
And they said at EA that this was not possible before origin
Hmm
Well they can say whatever they want but I mean I think you know it's possible
Look at you know Open Faint
Yeah but Open Faint isn't really a app it's a enhancement to existing apps
Yeah but they're saying that it's no it wasn't possible to be able to share leaderboard data without EA's you know origin thing
But that's bullshit because
There's game center
There's game center and there's Open Faint and I'm sure that other people can find ways to do stuff like that
I mean whatever fine PR spin
Gamer girl in chat says only for sims but otherwise EA stands for eat ass as in EA eats ass
Rama says I liked EA better when they were known as electronic arts
I liked EA better when they were ECA
Want to go back in time a little bit
Check out some of the loading screens on my favorite Commodore 64 games like pinball construction set was an ECA game
Did anybody ever play pinball construction set?
That game was fucking rad
No
Anyhow
That's it let's take some calls 1877 game OLR our username on skype is orange lounge radio
The skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight on the show
Or something else that you think we haven't covered yet
Skypline is open
While we wait for some calls thanks to the delay Loki have any last minute stories for us
Yeah sure one of the things that came out this week was kind of cool is they had a mod for Call of Duty modern warfare
That basically turned it into a version of like battlefront so you can actually go check that out
It's a thing they're calling it star what was the actual I can't remember the hell they called it now
It's like a some Star Wars game I gotta find the damn link now
It looked neat though I mean I basically look like battlefront so whenever that actually makes its way out
But it's finally done you can actually download it for free
This is one of the hosted mods
Yay free
Exactly
I guess they're selling 8-bit glasses now they kind of look stupid if you ask me
Yeah I saw him too and I was like meh
I see that they have an app remember we were saying that that might happen or something like that but the free to be kicked
It was you know for the people they're playing free to play team fortress 2 that they get kicked
Yeah that was that and I was saying that's everything that's wrong with gaming culture but yeah
Yeah that kind of sucks
Let's see here if I can find this here ah there we go Galactic Warfare is what it was
And you can find that on the ModDB website
Let's see here yeah moddb.com just search for the Star Wars Galactic Warfare mod for Call of Duty 4
Looks pretty awesome
Let's see what other stuff we could talk about here
Again Skyplane is open 1877 game OLR username on skype is orange lounge radio we'll give it another couple minutes
Maybe nobody wants to call tonight then it's fine we've had a long show
Zether in our chat says apparently Sega may not be releasing the second Phantasy Star PSP game or Valkyria Chronicles 3 here
Yeah I was reading about that second Phantasy Star PSP game but I'm more looking forward to this whole Phantasy Star Online 2
Remember? That's still coming
I want to try it out
Me too
Zether says that's possibly due to piracy causing poor sales
Yeah but there's piracy in other countries as well as just here I think it's just because their games aren't selling well over here versus Japan
Could it also be that you know the PSP is kind of on its way out so you really have to evaluate what you're going to put on the PSP
Yeah they probably don't want to pay to localize it so it makes sense I guess
Xbox Live Indie games creators are expressing their disappointment with the low sales on the service
They say that there's not enough exposure for their games and like for example there was sequence which sold around 2000 copies
And they say that's kind of a flop and he's looking at the PC and mobile platforms for future projects
It's not financially viable to do a large scale project and not expect with any certainty to make some money on the indie marketplace
Also they said that Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World both pretty well known games on the marketplaces
Sold 50,000 and 16,000 copies each respectively making them relative hits for indie games
I think that our games could sell a lot better than they did with a better platform, more visibility
And he's testing that by releasing both of them on Steam on July 13th for $3
Hey the phone's finally lighting up let's see who's on the other line
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
Legend of Zaku here
Hey buddy how you doing?
Nothing much just like relaxing
I miss New York
I miss New York for tomorrow, granted I had like a nasty weekend of just working, yes I had to show up to work on a Saturday
Working on the weekend, well life sucks I've had to work on Saturday too
Yeah I'm gonna need you to come in on Saturday
Yeah I think my boss was jokingly referring to that, he did the Bill Lumbergh voice
Oh great, well at least he had a sense of humor about it
Yeah but at least it got done yesterday and at least I'm relaxing today
Nice
So basically, yeah that whole EA Origin thing I kind of like killed any and all motivation for me to actually upgrade my PC
It's like I was betting the barn on Battlefield 3 showing up on Steam but because of this shit
I don't know it's like on one hand I have like almost 4 year old hardware but on the other I have no games that I'm looking forward to to justify it
And I'm not talking about Modern Warfare 3 because that's a non-starter
That game is like I'm not gonna jump on that hype bandwagon, I was banking on Battlefield 3
But if they pull out some bullshit copy protection stuff that's gonna turn me off
It needs to be like Steam where even though there is copy protection it doesn't feel like it
It's oblivious to the user and that's how it should be, it should be non-intrusive
Agree, agree
But we don't know how Origin's gonna play out because it used to be known as download manager
And even then they still had plenty of copy protection on the games they sold through that one
That's, you know, one reason I truly think crisis was like completely plagued with it, I wanted to buy crisis
Hold on Zaku, Zaku
You're wrong, basically stop me, I don't want that shit
Zaku, I really think that the reason people are all over Steam doesn't even have to necessarily do with its interface and all of that
I think it's honestly the crazy fucking deals they have on there, I don't think anybody would have given Steam a second look otherwise
I think it would have been about as popular as X-Fire
It can be true because they can, like, you know, these past couple of weekends they had their annual summer sale
So, I mean, yeah, sure, I took advantage of it by getting Call of Duty 4 for 10 bucks
Dude, Zaku, hold on, I want to say something
Do you remember X-Fire?
Um, I, faintly, I think I've seen him in certain episodes from time to time
Here's the thing, no, no, it's not a user, it's an actual program
And I think MTV Games bought them, thinking it was going to be the next big thing
Steam blew that program out of the fucking water
Because what they did is they took a lot of the things that X-Fire brought to the table and built a store around it that had killer deals
Okay, yeah, I think I remember, I may have dabbled with this a while ago
But you're right, it's like, yeah, Steam pretty much consolidates everything into one app
Into one, like, interface
Like, obviously the friends list and the browser just, like, overlay on top of the game in the background
My point is, Steam didn't really bring anything new to the table
It just made it, it's like Apple
Yes, it brought it to the table extremely well
Kind of like a lot of Microsoft products, like the Xbox
Well, it's more like Apple, like, taking something that already exists but marketing it well to the point where they make money
And that's what Steam did, they know how to market something like that
Something that gamers would want to go after
My point is that Origin, we don't really know what it's bringing to the table yet
Like, a lot of people, I think, are Team Steam in this, including myself
Because we don't really fully understand why EA wants full control of this
I mean, the way I see it is that, to them, Origin is something that's completely out of place to their norms
Case in point, Steam, it's something that they feel comfortable with
If you throw in Origin, it's something that hasn't been proven, it's not tried and true yet
And it's something that EA is still working on, it's still in its infancy
So it's really, it's the uncertainty that Origin brings to these guys
To these people that are very, you know, that are hesitant about it
And that's what's causing the rift and backlash
You know, in my honest opinion
It's like, I know Battlefield 3 will be an awesome game, but the way that the distribution is like
That plays an integral role in the fact that it can make or break their sales
You don't want somebody downloading a lemon, which is gonna be useless if it's locked down pretty tight
You know, to the point where only pirates will have the best experience
Well, I agree, the thing about Origin is that the first copy protection or whatever type of mistake they make will kill them
And this is the interesting thing about new technologies, is that the first mistake, if they make it early on, will murder them
Case in point, Google Buzz
Google Buzz was murdered by what they did with the privacy thing
If they screw up to the point where it makes Steam look, you know, really
It reaffirms that Steam is the only choice, then that's it
Then EA basically has like a walking dead man right there in Origin
The way that Origin can not only be on par if not maybe outdo Steam
Is try to bring something that hasn't been, you know, first of all they have to
One, make sure that the copy protection is not oblivious and more importantly, not obstructive to the user
The second point is they have to do something unique that differentiates themselves from Steam
Aside from what Steam has already done, I'm pretty certain that they're gonna have all the social aspects
It needs to show me what is worth leaving Steam for
And if they can't produce killer fucking deals that convince me to drop $40 on a bunch of games I'll probably end up only playing once
Then I'm not so sure they're gonna come out ahead
They need to have a contingency plan if Origin for some reason fails
Then they're right back where they were a year ago
They'll be fine
I understand, I understand, I'm not talking about right now but more long term
They need to have some sort of contingency plan in place
I'm pretty certain Valve has something in place if, should Steam ever fail and they would have to like, you know, wind down
Because they're gonna see a lot of piss off people where their digital content is not worth jack and they can't hold on to it
Remember, the content is only as good as the service that's keeping it, that's backing it up
That allows you, that enables you to actually play it
Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go but before I let you go, I am getting a request from chat
No
I can counter that with the...
Alright, Zaku, thanks for your call
Alright
Nyan
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
What do you think about EA vs. Steam and all this stuff? Let us know
Meanwhile, do we have more last minute stories or did you burn them all?
I burned them all
Good job, Loki
They burned on a fire
Good job
Alright, so what's this, are we ready to announce what you're working on over there or do you need more time?
Because it did come to my attention that, you know, OLR does try to be on the cutting edge of like a bunch of social eds
But there was one that we've all been using that we're not using at OLR yet
I'll go ahead and tell everybody but I'm still working on the theme
We have a Tumblr now, there will be stuff on it
We're hipster
We'll post it with lots of pictures from Reddit
Tumblr is a really easy way to like cross post stuff and a lot of people, it's like it's...
It's the ultimate photo blog
It's MAME central, like when somebody sees something funny, they just posted their Tumblr, no words, no...
Well, you can post words like quotes and things, just pictures and stuff
And videos, but you can actually use it as a regular blog
Yeah, some people will want to follow that
We'll see what happens
Alright, let's go to the phone and take another call
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Hey, hey, it's Ronma
Hi, what's up buddy?
Not much, well, I have some interesting news to tell
Oh boy
Oh no, you'll like it
Okay
I am getting a Playstation 3
Yes! Why are you getting a Playstation 3?
Because a friend of mine is selling his first gen for 130 bucks
That's a good price
That is a good deal, especially because it's first gen
Wow! That's a low price
Yes, do you really think Sony's gonna pull $325 out of my broke ass?
I don't think so
Yeah, I gotta say, I would buy that too
First gens are better anyways because they have full backwards compatibility
I use mine to the fullest by not playing any Playstation 2 games
God, I wish...
You know, I know there's some people that would look at me and go
Why don't you just get a PS2 if you wanna play PS2 games?
But I can't tell you, having owned all the fucking consoles I do
I can't tell you how fucking convenient it is to have multiple in one box
Like, I really wish I lived in a world where the Wii, the 360 and the Playstation 3 were just one fucking console
Like, why can't I have this in life?
So
But you know what the funny thing is? You know what the reason why I'm really getting a PS3?
Because Joe Dave told me that they released the Goonies 25th anniversary edition on Blu-ray only
At that point I was like, yeah, I gotta get a PS3 now
That is pretty awesome
My husband says that's inaccurate
Oh, it is, it's inaccurate
Wait, what?
Dan? Dan!
Explanation!
Oh, he says it's coming to DVD too
It's also on DVD
Well, the fact that I heard that first, I'm like, well, for me that's not a reason to get a PS3
I don't know what it is since most of my games are on the 360
My question is this
Demon's Souls and LittleBigPlanet
Oh my god, LittleBigPlanet
Yes, Dan is correct, I just double checked on Amazon
Both are available
You were lied to
By a lying liar
I'll pistol whip her later
Alright
With love
Alright, any other thoughts, Raman, before I let you go?
I want to know what game should I get for my PS3
I want to pick from all three of you
You absolutely need LittleBigPlanet
Absolutely the must-have game on PlayStation 3
Dark Soccer?
Dance is infamous
Loki?
I would do Resistance
You can probably pick up, they have the Resistance dual pack now
With one and two in there, just pick that up and it's a good time
There you go
Works for me
Alright, well have fun with your PS3 and add me, kay?
I will, dude
Alright
Alright
Bye
1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio
I guess we can fit in one more call, one quick little call
See, it does suck because I do have to still pick up Infamous, or not Infamous, Resistance
I actually have Infamous now, I have the download mark for my PS3 from me, welcome back
And I have number two
Although I'm probably going to sell number two because I don't know if I'll really get into the series
Randy in our chatroom says, quick, back out of the purchase, Raman
Yeah, back out so I can buy it
Although that would be a waste of money because I really do have a PS2 already and all that good stuff
Alright, I guess we have time for one more call, let's take this
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Hi, this is Spaznator
Hey Spaznator, what's up buddy?
Well, two things, just in reference to the last call that you just had
If I were to recommend any games for the PS3, aside from a little bit playing what you already mentioned
I would probably go with the Resistance games, those are pretty good
I want to say this though real fast, Rama if you have the money just do LittleBigPlanet 2
Because all the old LittleBigPlanet levels you can play in LittleBigPlanet 2
Meaning the created levels online, just so you know
I hate to say it because you guys know I've been a really big supporter of PlayStation 3 and all that
I know, and you're that abused significant other that keeps coming back
I'm practically Sony's red-headed stepchild right now
Since March of last year I have had three PlayStation 3's get the yellow lighted up
Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that I got so much money invested in the system
In terms of downloadable games and of course the videos
I've got to ask this though Spaznator, is there anything you think there might be about how you use your PlayStation 3
I have to ask it, that could be contributing, like do you leave it in a poorly ventilated place
Do you use the thing so much that it just can't handle it, is it on all day
I don't know, I'm trying to think, just what could be your luck
The only thing I could come up with that could possibly factor into it
Is that my entire building as a whole is practically hotter than a hemorrhoid on Satan's ass during the summertime
I mean, you know, at least in terms of my particular place
I store my system, normally try to keep it ventilated at least 10 inches on each side
For ventilation and all that, but during the summertime the building just gets hot
But that can't totally factor into it
Because my system got the yellow lighted up twice last spring
And my building doesn't even get hot during the spring
In fact it's practically freezing cold during the spring
Let me ask this, because this is the question that the chatters are dying to know the answer to
Are you breaking up with Sony, is this it, are you saying Sony, I want to see someone else and her name is Microsoft
I'm severely tempted to, the only reason I'm intentionally having my system fixed
Is what I was starting to see a minute ago
Is that I have so much money invested in downloadable games, the DLC and the videos
I just hate to see myself lose access to that
Stuff that I already bought or got for free up until now
At least for a tiny baby until if I do get it fixed
I've been playing my 360 lot along with WoW since I just started WoW like a week or two ago
But it just killed me that the system just died plus
Now what little money I have coming soon was already earmarked for something else
And now I have to scrounge up money to get my system fixed
And rearrange my plans and stuff like that, so it's a pain in the watch
Well, keep us posted on what happens in this ongoing saga
And good luck, maybe see if Rama will sell you that PS3
I don't know, alright Spaznator, I gotta let you go to wrap up the show, but take care buddy
Alright, have a good one
Alright, bye bye
Man, we had the sad trombone email and now we have the sad trombone phone call
Three Playstation 3s get the yellow light of death
Some guys have all the luck
And yet he didn't say I'm breaking up with Sony, he said you know I just
I've spent so much on Sony over the years, I still love Sony
