1
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:15,937
[SPEAKER_06]: by Teth 2011.

2
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:19,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the PlayStation 4 really set to start production soon?

3
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:23,606
[SPEAKER_06]: The PSP says goodbye to comics and Nintendo faces a lawsuit over

4
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,826
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers I want cake

5
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:55,674
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

6
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:31,305
[SPEAKER_05]: and so we had a joint cake that's one of our friends bought and there's one of those snarky you know friends that's you know funny bitchy funny and but got a cake that said happy birthday princesses with the two Mickey and Minnie Mouse on it so but it was cute and I ate some of the sand part

7
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:34,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just very happy because we just didn't want chocolate.

8
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:39,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you might remember on OLR a few weeks ago, I got a chocolate cake, which was great.

9
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:40,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved it.

10
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:40,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.

11
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I went to work and I had a chocolate cake at work from coworkers.

12
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:45,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, oh, yay, more chocolate.

13
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:47,669
[SPEAKER_07]: But I bet Becky's cake was better.

14
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:52,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Becky's cake was better because you could tell the difference between homemade and store-bought.

15
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,631
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I appreciated the cake at work.

16
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:56,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.

17
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:57,031
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

18
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:03,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the Becky cake was a little more from the heart, if you will, rather than from the grocery store.

19
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:15,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's go over to the third co-host on our show, here with us as he's been every single week since episode one, with few minor exceptions like when kids are born.

20
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:16,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

21
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:17,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

22
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, how are you tonight, Loki?

23
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:20,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little sick, but I'm alright.

24
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,700
[SPEAKER_05]: You're sick?

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,321
[SPEAKER_05]: You better not get me sick, I'm gonna kick your butt.

26
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:27,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I've been doing everything possible not to get anybody else sick.

27
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:30,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been washing my hands like crazy and that's pretty much it.

28
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:30,543
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

29
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a bucket of Lysol I could dump on him.

30
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:35,425
[SPEAKER_05]: You might need to do that because I really can't get sick.

31
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:37,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of work, I have a lot going on at work.

32
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:38,386
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not bad.

33
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:39,506
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just congestion.

34
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:40,106
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

35
00:02:40,346 --> 00:02:43,688
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like I'm throwing up or something.

36
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:47,409
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like it could very well be allergies, but it's not.

37
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:48,890
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

38
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:03,118
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:25,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't go that far.

40
00:03:25,177 --> 00:03:26,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, I'm not Arnold Schwarzenegger.

41
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:27,378
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

42
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:38,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's talk about video games as we get into another week here at OLR, where we talk about the gaming news, invite you guys to call us, and of course, join us in chat at chat.orangelandre.com.

43
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:39,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of the chat.

44
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:39,827
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

45
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:43,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to ask Azure Edge, who said, I love bronies.

46
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:47,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that like brownies for bros?

47
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:50,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the My Little Brony thing that we were talking about a couple weeks ago?

48
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:50,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

49
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:54,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a phantom W in that.

50
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:57,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless bronies are actually like... That would be brownies.

51
00:03:58,296 --> 00:04:00,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Brownies with like bacon inside of them.

52
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, brownies with bacon.

53
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:03,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Those would be bronies.

54
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:07,300
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of my friends, they're actually sisters, they make bacon brownies.

55
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:13,536
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we are very much considering a pork party for Josh's first birthday.

56
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:14,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm serious.

57
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:17,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It's looking like it's probably going to happen.

58
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:19,342
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you could protest.

59
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:21,664
[SPEAKER_05]: You could stand outside with your PETA sign.

60
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:51,390
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck PETA no no no no here's some other fun random things real quick one of the other runner up ideas for a party and we're probably thinking about this for maybe second or third year and you're gonna laugh pedo bear themed why would you do that for your child it's funny because our friends would know what it is but our family doesn't know what pedo bear is it's just a teddy bear it would be hilarious

61
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to get a bounce house and everything?

62
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:55,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

63
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,231
[SPEAKER_07]: You should get the Pikachu bounce house where you climb into Pikachu's butt to get inside.

64
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:03,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I think DarkSakura should dress up as Pito Bear.

65
00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:12,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I said internet meme theme party because we were trying to think of something that's not been done before.

66
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:15,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Pork party, I think, is pretty... You should do a troll party and make everyone wear troll masks.

67
00:05:15,953 --> 00:05:19,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, if you do an internet meme party, I will come as Nyan Cat.

68
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:22,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I will have little rainbow streamers behind me.

69
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:23,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll wear a Pop-Tart.

70
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:27,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that would be funny, but maybe not this year.

71
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:45,082
[SPEAKER_04]: This year, and the only reason she was thinking of doing Pork Party, because she mentioned it, I guess, some of her Facebook, like, mommy friends or whatever, one of them makes cakes, and they said, oh, I could make a pig cake with an apple in its mouth, and the apple would be its own personal little cake for Josh.

72
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:45,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

73
00:05:46,443 --> 00:05:47,544
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

74
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:06,162
[SPEAKER_05]: For all those pickled pig's feet.

75
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:13,664
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it's kind of sick because we used to go there for, you know, like Easter and Christmas and all the holidays when I was younger.

76
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:17,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And man, we would just have a feast of like bacon and like all that stuff.

77
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:21,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And it didn't really hit me until like much later in life.

78
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:22,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh God.

79
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:23,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of...

80
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:28,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take some bacon outside for the pigs.

81
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:30,575
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to go out to the barn and look at the baby pigs.

82
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:31,916
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, oh, it's cute, the baby pigs.

83
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:33,498
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'd come in and just feast on ham.

84
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,703
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm realizing, God, that was kind of messed up.

85
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:42,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, even when I did eat pork, ham has always been so disgusting to me.

86
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,532
[SPEAKER_07]: It just tastes, like, not right.

87
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:52,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I promise we'll get into video games here in a minute, but I have to say, about, like, ham, I gotta say, I am a ham person.

88
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the honey-baked hams.

89
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:54,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are my favorite.

90
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:58,598
[SPEAKER_05]: But for Thanksgiving, I really don't like turkey.

91
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not a turkey person, so... See, I'd always get my own drumstick.

92
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,702
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother's very kind in that she always makes a ham for Thanksgiving.

93
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:08,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is funny, because I have two brothers, and we would always fight over them.

94
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:10,644
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd just say, fine, neither of you can have them.

95
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:13,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd wrap one up and put it in the fridge.

96
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,545
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, video games.

97
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:23,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Quickly, before we get into gaming weeks, I want to do a quick follow-up to a story from last week because it's not on the show roll anywhere.

98
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:35,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf, who, of course, as he has been for many, many, many, many weeks, is on before us as we do tape live every Sunday night at allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby's show.

99
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:40,010
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things he was talking about on his 300th episode—grats on the ding, by the way—

100
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,431
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

101
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:10,665
[SPEAKER_05]: which leads me to believe that you hit the nail on the head last week, Loki, when Reggie's going to come out.

102
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:11,766
[SPEAKER_05]: It may not be next E3.

103
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:13,668
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be the holiday or the spring.

104
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:14,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be next E3.

105
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,669
[SPEAKER_05]: You think all the way to next E3?

106
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:26,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's next E3 because localization doesn't take that long and because they want to have something saying, hey, we haven't forgotten about you, because the whole point is they're going to try to...

107
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Let the hardcore gamers know we haven't forgotten about you.

108
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:32,402
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you need to buy our new system.

109
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:37,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, granted, those are Wii games, but they still play on the new Wii U system.

110
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:39,807
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's kind of the whole theme.

111
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:42,629
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like they're going to be trying... Because they need that hardcore crowd.

112
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:45,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the casual gamer doesn't give a shit about their new system.

113
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:49,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, eventually they will because of the touchscreen thing, but...

114
00:08:50,254 --> 00:08:58,839
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be convincing these people that really bought the system for Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort and maybe Mario Kart or something like that why they need to go out and buy another system.

115
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:03,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, Nintendo doesn't just have to have one press conference a year, though.

116
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:14,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see anything stopping Nintendo from... Thinking again what you said last week about they'll come out and say, except you said it a lot more angry, the fans demanded it, and here it is.

117
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:25,282
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason they couldn't do this big thing at Nintendo World in New York City where they'll have a big press conference and invite people to play the games in for the first time because it's what you the game...

118
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:29,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Gamer Wanted, and we listen because we're the company that loves our fans.

119
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:34,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

120
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:44,489
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have easily phrased it away without... Because what's the point in saying, you know, why even say no, it's not something that we're working on right now?

121
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:48,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's an important point from Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at chat.orangeonstrady.com.

122
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:51,152
[SPEAKER_05]: C goes back to when they said, not at this time.

123
00:09:51,672 --> 00:10:00,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it possible that the intern that updates Facebook perhaps just, you know, had to say something, but realized they couldn't exactly spoil an upcoming press conference?

124
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:06,796
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they don't have to say anything, and if it is E3, why do they even have to say anything?

125
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:07,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's put it this way.

126
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:12,620
[SPEAKER_04]: They went out during E3 and said, hey, we're going to work on a Smash Bros.

127
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:12,800
[SPEAKER_04]: game.

128
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we haven't started working on a Smash Bros.

129
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:18,224
[SPEAKER_04]: game yet, but we will eventually work on it.

130
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:24,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if they're going to announce stuff that we will eventually work on versus something that they're maybe...

131
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:25,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

132
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,357
[SPEAKER_04]: without looking like complete assholes at the same time.

133
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:50,959
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, they decided, hey, we're just going to say, no, we don't have any plans to do that, and everyone gets pissed off at them.

134
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of think the intern just did what they had to do.

135
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then they should come out.

136
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,121
[SPEAKER_04]: They have an opportunity to update at any time.

137
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:00,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what?

138
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Word is, actually, we are going to be bringing these over.

139
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:02,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's...

140
00:11:05,743 --> 00:11:06,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned for more details.

141
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:23,294
[SPEAKER_05]: but are they doing any sort of press conference at PAX?

142
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:36,344
[SPEAKER_05]: PAX doesn't usually have press conferences but PAX they will probably have a presence on the show floor usually the Washington because PAX is up in Seattle PAX Prime anyway and they're right in the backyard of Microsoft and Nintendo so there's no reason

143
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:38,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the one year we all went to PAX.

144
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:43,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that had been the first time that Animal Crossing was shown out on the floor.

145
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it had made E3 that year.

146
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:52,031
[SPEAKER_05]: My memory is a little bit fuzzy, but I seem to remember there was something on the floor that year that actually was new for Nintendo that they had not shown at E3.

147
00:11:52,492 --> 00:12:02,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And PAX being the whole fan service expo and delivering what the fans want and doing a mighty good job at it would actually seem like the perfect idea.

148
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:05,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a great idea from Bobby.

149
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:21,657
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that I think might be a little bit maybe not is that it's a little soon, but it could also kind of add up to this bigger equation that maybe Nintendo wanted to make E3 all about these games and then they want to make packs about the other stuff.

150
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:32,986
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like packs would make more sense because if they're localizing this stuff for Europe already, localizing it for the United States, North America, they've already done all the voice and translation work.

151
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:34,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that they really need to do anything.

152
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all they have to worry about is the NTSC versus PAL.

153
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,511
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the stuff they have to worry about.

154
00:12:39,531 --> 00:12:40,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just rendering.

155
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:42,714
[SPEAKER_04]: High def, it doesn't matter anyway.

156
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Or 480p.

157
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Wii.

158
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:47,479
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

159
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

160
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Your Wii will interpret it any way.

161
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:52,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

162
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:54,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

163
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:57,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that they could have done it in a more...

164
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:00,358
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

165
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:45,612
[SPEAKER_04]: and the interns know that update Facebook I better stick to the schedule you know I can't or they may not even know themselves but as we as we're going to get in the more information that's not true we know that's not true they've come out and said that that's not true because of certain factors that play into certain things and you can't just stick to a strict schedule anyways because you don't know what's going to happen

166
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:47,213
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

167
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:17,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little more eventful.

168
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:21,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I played that game that you sent me, Terrarium.

169
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:22,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Terraria, I think.

170
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:24,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Terraria.

171
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:29,507
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty fun so far, but it's still horizontal Minecraft.

172
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:36,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I dug a lot of holes and died a lot and popped slimes with pickaxe.

173
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:37,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I played some WoW.

174
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,851
[SPEAKER_07]: One item level away.

175
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:43,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid Firelands.

176
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:48,063
[SPEAKER_07]: What else did I do?

177
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:52,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Portal 2 some more today and I played Droplets the other night.

178
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,249
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do in Portal 2 on all your replays?

179
00:14:56,289 --> 00:15:00,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going for achievements or are you just trying to get your speed better?

180
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:04,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done all of the single player achievements except for one of the speed levels.

181
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,217
[SPEAKER_07]: But mostly I just go through because it's fun.

182
00:15:07,837 --> 00:15:08,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I just keep playing it.

183
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:10,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I like watching your favorite movie.

184
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:15,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I played some Doom 2.

185
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:18,194
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of random.

186
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's not as good as I remember, but it's still fun.

187
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:28,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I still remember a lot of my cheats, like, what is it, IDDQD, IDBFG, IDKF.

188
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:28,716
[SPEAKER_05]: IDGAF.

189
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,897
[SPEAKER_07]: IDKFA, you know.

190
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:56,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I just remember in Doom when you could make the screen like you could adjust the screen size to get your computer to render it better for older systems and on my like really old it was either my 386 or my 486 100 I don't even remember it so long ago I had to put the window at like the minimum size to get it to run decently it was this little tiny window on my screen it's like trying to play a game boy on my computer screen

191
00:15:57,588 --> 00:15:58,248
[SPEAKER_07]: NRA was all weaponed.

192
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you picking up these games through Steam sale?

193
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

194
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:29,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

195
00:16:29,911 --> 00:16:33,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I already had Hexen, but I picked up the Doom Pack.

196
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:34,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so mad I missed that.

197
00:16:34,713 --> 00:16:35,614
[SPEAKER_07]: The Doom Pack was $8.

198
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:39,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed the Quake Pack when it was on sale for like $7.

199
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:45,038
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, yeah, it's probably still a good deal at $20, but there's just something about the whole you're getting it at a really good deal.

200
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Steam sales are so dangerous, I'm telling you.

201
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,900
[SPEAKER_05]: When we get to My Gaming Week, it's the same story.

202
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish they'd put out all the Sim stuff cheap.

203
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:53,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wait, Rob.

204
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it'll go on sale again once Rage comes out.

205
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:56,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it will.

206
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:57,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.

207
00:16:57,325 --> 00:16:59,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll wait for this.

208
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:03,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I have plenty to hold me over until, for months, for months.

209
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:05,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, DarkSakura, anything else?

210
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:11,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I tried to play DAC again, the Star Trek DAC, and I always keep forgetting that I need a controller to play it.

211
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:15,725
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, I'll just grab one of the Xbox controllers one day.

212
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:17,072
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

213
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:17,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

214
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:39,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

215
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:58,448
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

216
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:19,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of 200,000 plus players, being 85 is not bad.

217
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:24,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just still working on getting up there.

218
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:29,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at one point trying to beat this player named Chuck Norris just because it'd be funny.

219
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,541
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to defeat Chuck Norris.

220
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:33,463
[SPEAKER_04]: But now he's gone.

221
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Chevy Chase, I'm after you.

222
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:41,481
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of Earth Defense Force.

223
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:44,842
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was pretty much it this week.

224
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:45,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Really didn't play a whole lot.

225
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:47,803
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

226
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:50,304
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week.

227
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:51,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

228
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:56,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I found that Steam sale to be very dangerous, that whole thing that they're doing this week.

229
00:18:56,726 --> 00:19:02,507
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have easily dropped $40 to $50 on games, which is exactly what they want people to do.

230
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:03,627
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the whole trick behind it.

231
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, I've got to say, I've picked up a lot of good stuff.

232
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:08,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's some of the stuff I've played this week.

233
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:17,430
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favorites, and it's one of those things where I've known about this game for the longest time, and I hear good things about it, and I just, for whatever reason, have never played it.

234
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just too busy playing WoW or something on the Xbox or what have you, and I always neglect to look at this game.

235
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:28,152
[SPEAKER_05]: But I finally picked up Beat Hazard, which is a game that's available on Steam, and it's on sale.

236
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:33,153
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this whole combo pack going on right now where it's Beat Hazard, Ultra, and all this other stuff.

237
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:56,542
[SPEAKER_05]: um basically in a nutshell imagine if like Geometry Wars kind of met a game where you could put your own music in and then add super seizure robots to the whole thing that's what beat hazard is is it's I I look I usually am not the photo sensitive type and and uh you know I don't usually have reactions to video games but I gotta say in playing beat hazard um

238
00:19:57,342 --> 00:20:00,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously think I felt a little odd playing it.

239
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:04,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, you know, I'm not usually prone to this type of stuff, but this game is going to do it.

240
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:08,748
[SPEAKER_05]: If any game is going to set me off and cause me to have a seizure, it's probably going to be this game.

241
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:13,211
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't played the game, you're this little ship.

242
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:20,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way it controls is kind of interesting on the computer because you use your mouse to target things and use the button to shoot on your mouse.

243
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:23,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But you use WASD to move your ship.

244
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

245
00:20:48,892 --> 00:21:12,118
[SPEAKER_05]: and the the ships kind of I guess are generated based on the music but the speed is kind of driven by the music and most importantly kind of the pulse of the bullets and the background and everything is driven by the beats of the game and a lot of your power-ups are based around volume you can the the basically the more powerful you are the louder the song gets which is kind of cool

246
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:17,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I think I paid about $6 for the whole thing.

247
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:20,784
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a pretty good deal, so very happy with that.

248
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:24,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the other games I've bought during this sale.

249
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:26,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Archon.

250
00:21:27,248 --> 00:21:42,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea that the classic 80s Commodore 64 slash NES game Archon was now on PC until I believe it was Travis from Under Sedation Live.

251
00:21:42,838 --> 00:21:43,319
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

252
00:22:05,572 --> 00:22:06,373
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

253
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:32,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Kaijudo says, Beat Hazard will blow your eye sockets.

254
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:34,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the demo and it almost killed me.

255
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:40,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, to be fair, you can turn down the intensity of the effects, but who wants to do that?

256
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this as well.

257
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:45,602
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I love about Beat Hazard...

258
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:57,007
[SPEAKER_05]: For what is a pretty simple concept, they've poured a lot of replayability factors into the game in the way of power-ups and achievements.

259
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:06,114
[SPEAKER_05]: The more you level through and the more songs you play, you get power-ups that you can permanently buy for your ship.

260
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:10,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can pick five of the power-ups for your ship for a song.

261
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:15,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of times what the power-ups do is they do things to your ship to increase either survivability or score.

262
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:25,205
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're the type that wants to go for the highest score possible amongst your friends, you use the enhancements that you unlock the more you play to get that.

263
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:33,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that's kind of a neat way to do it and what kind of really enhances the playability of what's otherwise a very simple game.

264
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:39,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gifted Plants vs. Zombies by our listener xlink who was on Horde House a couple weeks ago.

265
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:46,094
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like a late birthday present and finally I know DarkSakura is a huge fan of Plants vs. Zombies.

266
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:46,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes I am.

267
00:23:46,714 --> 00:23:47,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've played the game before.

268
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:52,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played the free one online but now I have the PC version and I was playing that for a little bit and

269
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:55,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfecting my strategy against zombies.

270
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:02,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize there was a whole little mode where you could create your own zombie, and then that zombie will show up in the final wave as you play the game.

271
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:03,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was kind of cool.

272
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:05,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if you do more than one, both of them can show up.

273
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:06,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

274
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:07,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I only did the one.

275
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the point of it at first was just to make a little...

276
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:37,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Avatar that you could use on instant messenger or on web forums and stuff which is actually a really smart idea to try and get the game exposed and I'm surprised more people haven't kind of hopped on that train where like let people make a custom avatar from your game which okay now I'm sounding kind of stupid because that's what the Xbox 360 avatar stuff is all about but I guess this is the first time I've kind of seen it in a PC fashion and kind of let them spread the word about the game.

277
00:24:37,261 --> 00:24:37,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

278
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:37,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

279
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:01,110
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've bought some games.

280
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,732
[SPEAKER_05]: See, here's the other dangerous thing about the Steam sale.

281
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:06,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I have bought games I haven't even freaking played yet.

282
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:15,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the games I bought was Amnesia, which is supposed to be just like a horrifically scary game.

283
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:17,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I was even scared by the trailer.

284
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:22,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's seriously like a scare the pants off of you game, don't play this in the dark type of thing.

285
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:24,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited to check out Amnesia.

286
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:26,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know much about this game, DarkSakura?

287
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:27,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you like the survival horror stuff.

288
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:29,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Go look at the trailer on there for Amnesia.

289
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,390
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to tell me if you think it's scary or not.

290
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,610
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

291
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:36,471
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'll say about my gaming week.

292
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:37,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, it's been the other stuff.

293
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:38,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XIII.

294
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:44,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm up to like 30 hours, 35 hours spent in the game.

295
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:46,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm getting closer to the end.

296
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:50,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still in Chapter 11 because I've been doing a crap ton of side quests.

297
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:52,674
[SPEAKER_05]: But getting closer to the end.

298
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:53,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm back in the main story now.

299
00:25:54,474 --> 00:25:57,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm climbing a big tower, for those of you that know the game.

300
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:59,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And probably ring a bell to some of you.

301
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:00,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you running up that hill?

302
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm running up that hill.

303
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,363
[SPEAKER_05]: To make a deal with a foul sea.

304
00:26:06,444 --> 00:26:07,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And convince them to swap our places.

305
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:09,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

306
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:12,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, Warcraft and all that other fun stuff.

307
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's it for my game of the week.

308
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:17,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

309
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:23,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR and Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

310
00:26:24,297 --> 00:26:25,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Big welcome to you.

311
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:34,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether it be your first time or your 400th time listening to the show, please always feel free to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or join us live.

312
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:35,922
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatters would love to see some new people.

313
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:41,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunday nights here at All Games Radio is where we tape Orange Lounge Radio, www.

314
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to give a shout out as well.

315
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:44,768
[SPEAKER_05]: This is important.

316
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:48,633
[SPEAKER_05]: We just celebrated a big anniversary a couple weeks ago, our ninth anniversary.

317
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:59,907
[SPEAKER_05]: But next week on All Games Radio, or this Saturday, depending on when you're listening, July 16th is the 10th anniversary of Under Sedation Live.

318
00:27:00,407 --> 00:27:00,827
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

319
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:35,860
[SPEAKER_05]: The show's just missing me, but I'm going to be back on Saturday to say hello for the 10th anniversary.

320
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:37,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy 10th anniversary.

321
00:27:37,963 --> 00:27:42,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it's just going to be Travis dogging me for three hours, but...

322
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,085
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

323
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,065
[SPEAKER_07]: We gave him a little fodder.

324
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:45,806
[SPEAKER_05]: He's great.

325
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:50,167
[SPEAKER_05]: After 10 years of hard work, I suppose he's earned it.

326
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,988
[SPEAKER_05]: But not that I'm going to go quietly.

327
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,548
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm going to say about that.

328
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a lot bitchier now than I was 10 years ago.

329
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,170
[SPEAKER_05]: No, seriously, though, it'll be fun.

330
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:02,750
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out.

331
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturday night at All Games Radio.

332
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,911
[SPEAKER_05]: More information at understationlive.org.

333
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:08,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we can get into some gaming news.

334
00:28:08,675 --> 00:28:15,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about what's going on in the gaming industry this week and get your thoughts live in our chat room at chat.orangelandre.com and on the Skype line later on.

335
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:16,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, start us off.

336
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:26,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Square Enix was a little bit sad after their game Deus Ex Human Revolution has been leaked out to the public.

337
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:34,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, preview code for the game, which was hosted on Steam, the account was hacked.

338
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:43,340
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a game preview code meant for people in the preview review program, kind of for the press.

339
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:54,011
[SPEAKER_04]: and one of the outlets, I guess, it's a French outlet, their account got hacked and this game was downloaded and then, of course, it spread out there kind of like wildfire.

340
00:28:55,132 --> 00:29:04,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, they're going after 15 unnamed John Does and seeking monetary damage in excess of $5,000 for the preview's distribution.

341
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:05,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the game wasn't

342
00:29:05,923 --> 00:29:10,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but it was, you know, kind of a preview build that leaked out there.

343
00:29:10,928 --> 00:29:13,651
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously this is not the first time that something like this has happened.

344
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:17,955
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I remember not too long ago, Crisis 2, same thing happened to that.

345
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:21,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And God, how many other games preview builds get leaked out for me?

346
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,620
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

347
00:29:24,922 --> 00:29:26,163
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are none too happy about that.

348
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:30,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

349
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:42,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Steam's supposed to be like this super secure thing, and it's interesting that the game kind of leaked off of it when it sounds like this might be more of like an error.

350
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,218
[SPEAKER_05]: or some sort.

351
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:49,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And my mistake, actually, it was an Italian gaming outlet that leaked that out or that the account got hacked from.

352
00:29:50,343 --> 00:29:51,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Steam, then, to clarify.

353
00:29:51,504 --> 00:29:53,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they said... Never mind, then.

354
00:29:53,506 --> 00:29:55,167
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be kind of confusing where it's come from.

355
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:57,909
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, it seems that even Square doesn't know yet.

356
00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:07,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather than aim its suit at the Italian gaming outlet, the Japanese publisher is instead directing its legal team at the 15 people that stole the game.

357
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:14,401
[SPEAKER_04]: or I guess that are distributing the game because I know it takes 15 people to download a game.

358
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:17,923
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know who they are because it's going to be 15 IP addresses basically.

359
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:18,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much, yeah.

360
00:30:18,844 --> 00:30:21,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

361
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:23,127
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about a case like this?

362
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:25,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think Square has a case against these folks?

363
00:30:25,848 --> 00:30:27,389
[SPEAKER_05]: If they can track them down, yeah.

364
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they hacked into someone's account.

365
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:34,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So the crime that's committed is impersonating someone else's account to get the game.

366
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:35,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.

367
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:35,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

368
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:37,449
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

369
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,373
[SPEAKER_05]: But what if those people come back and say, oh, it wasn't my IP.

370
00:30:40,854 --> 00:30:41,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't driving.

371
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:44,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody hacked into my Wi-Fi.

372
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:48,046
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the problem, because it is the burden of proof.

373
00:30:48,366 --> 00:30:52,030
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to have the proof that they did it, and just seeing that you have your IP.

374
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, people can spoof IPs easy.

375
00:30:56,595 --> 00:31:07,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if they're smart, if these people are the smart hacker types, obviously they're going to be running their IP through proxies and stuff like that, so it'll be even more difficult to track them down.

376
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:08,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

377
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:10,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta ask you about this.

378
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:15,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to get too tangenty, but since you brought up the whole IP spoofing, it made me think of this, a big article I read this week.

379
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:28,017
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about this whole agreement that I'm hearing that was passed this week between the major ISPs, including Comcast, AT&T, and a bunch of the other big ones, and copyright holders, essentially?

380
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:41,865
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to notify users when IPs are identified, which is kind of what was already being done, but now I think it's more streamlined and consistent between all the companies.

381
00:31:42,805 --> 00:31:48,588
[SPEAKER_05]: And if a user keeps ignoring the alerts, they will get pop-ups that they have to acknowledge.

382
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:51,530
[SPEAKER_05]: They might even get phone calls at some point.

383
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:51,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

384
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't obviously read too far into this.

385
00:31:55,512 --> 00:31:55,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

386
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:56,993
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about this whole thing?

387
00:31:57,524 --> 00:32:00,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, well, there's a couple things that are weird about it.

388
00:32:01,307 --> 00:32:17,419
[SPEAKER_04]: One, it would have to be, um, the way I understood it was, I believe, it's gonna be like, for example, like, if you were downloading TV episodes or something like that off of BitTorrent or something, and they figured out that you were doing it, or your IP was attached to it, they would notify you.

389
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,985
[SPEAKER_04]: To make sure that it's not, say, someone jumping onto your Wi-Fi or something like that.

390
00:32:25,346 --> 00:32:27,468
[SPEAKER_04]: They would notify you that that's going on.

391
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:33,352
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ignore that, and then they keep sending you notices, eventually they will start throttling your internet and whatnot.

392
00:32:33,693 --> 00:32:39,597
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem is, I don't think the actual Comcast or something like that are monitoring traffic.

393
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:44,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it would be very difficult for them to figure out what you're downloading online.

394
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:54,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the copyright holders will kind of... I'm assuming what they do is they seek out the torrent and they download it and they can see all the IPs that are sharing it.

395
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:58,789
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they send requests to the ISPs of all those IP addresses.

396
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,030
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the funny thing, though, too.

397
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:06,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can... There's a way that you can get around with them tracking where you're actually browsing.

398
00:33:06,954 --> 00:33:07,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but...

399
00:33:08,455 --> 00:33:13,258
[SPEAKER_04]: for one, using a DNS that's not provided by your ISP.

400
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:16,761
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use 4.2.2.1 or whatever is one of those.

401
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:27,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they have ways you can even download BitTorrent via proxy or something like that.

402
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:45,472
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know what there's other options out there other than BitTorrent I mean not just BitTorrent but there's you know like news groups and there's you know just plain straight up hosting a file on like one of the file sharing sites like Megal Upload or you know RapidShare you know

403
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:52,716
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you think this is going to be another case of the piracy will just evolve like it did when Napster got shut down?

404
00:33:52,756 --> 00:33:56,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anything's really changing too much.

405
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,300
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of doing it to scare people, I think.

406
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,802
[SPEAKER_04]: To get them saying, oh, we're going to be watching what you're doing.

407
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:08,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just if you're interested in stealing music or...

408
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:12,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Music or TV or something like that.

409
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:18,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think game publishers or PC publishers are really going out there hunting these people down.

410
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:22,055
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff out there that's still going to get pirated.

411
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:23,596
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

412
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,597
[SPEAKER_04]: The RIA and the MPA, two people that are backing this.

413
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:27,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

414
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:29,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course they're supporting it, yeah.

415
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:37,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Because all the backers are just all the MPA, the RIA, and then all the film and music studios and stuff like that.

416
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:38,323
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see any...

417
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:51,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing that surprised me most about the law was this whole fact that if you want to dispute it, you can, but you have to pay $35 to have that investigated.

418
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And something about that kind of struck me as wrong.

419
00:34:54,439 --> 00:35:02,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like the fact that – and granted, I try to have a secure setup in my home and all this stuff, but there's just something about –

420
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,328
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

421
00:35:23,146 --> 00:35:24,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill, yep, you know what?

422
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,527
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you have no other options in your neighborhood?

423
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:32,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I have to use one particular ISP in my neighborhood and I have no other options unless I want to go to DSL, which I really don't want to do.

424
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, file suit with the Better Business Bureau?

425
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know what you could do.

426
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:36,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know either.

427
00:35:36,611 --> 00:35:38,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you could, you can get around it, I'm sure.

428
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:39,833
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the sticking point for me.

429
00:35:39,893 --> 00:35:43,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't, I don't really pirate games.

430
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't pirate games.

431
00:35:45,555 --> 00:35:49,837
[SPEAKER_05]: The last time I would ever pirate a game was back in the PlayStation 1 days.

432
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:51,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do import games.

433
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:53,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Blink, blink

434
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:25,679
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I'm not gonna get on a moral soapbox about it or what have you, it's just, you know, it's just the way it is So, um, but, if I'm gonna download, like, last night's episode of The Voice, like, really?

435
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna get my ISP shut off over that?

436
00:36:29,943 --> 00:36:32,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it just, just kinda stinks, I don't know

437
00:36:34,546 --> 00:36:35,247
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

438
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:53,363
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

439
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,401
[SPEAKER_04]: There's ways around everything.

440
00:37:11,702 --> 00:37:22,813
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as they figure out what they're doing to find these people or whatever, there will be new programs, there will be new protocols, whatever, that people will develop in order to get around it.

441
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:31,862
[SPEAKER_07]: They're already renaming torrent files with weird spaces between letters and special characters and things, so...

442
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:35,372
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be surprised.

443
00:37:35,412 --> 00:37:38,855
[SPEAKER_05]: They are going after some TV show watchers.

444
00:37:39,575 --> 00:37:43,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And who was it in chat said they got a letter about Game of Thrones?

445
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:43,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there it is.

446
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:47,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma, I got a notice the other week about someone in my house downloading Game of Thrones.

447
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, that's an HBO show, and HBO is a paid network.

448
00:37:50,122 --> 00:37:52,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I sort of see where they are.

449
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that is a huge...

450
00:37:53,544 --> 00:37:54,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it doesn't become that.

451
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:16,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say right now, I download Supernatural because I hate watching commercials.

452
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:19,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'll just watch it on my computer.

453
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:24,376
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also own several of the box sets of the seasons anyway.

454
00:38:24,656 --> 00:38:28,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was going to say, Devil's Advocate, commercials are what make the TV shows free.

455
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:33,601
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also have the box sets.

456
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:36,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And a bunch of merchandise.

457
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:38,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the comics.

458
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:40,005
[SPEAKER_05]: You could probably watch them all on Netflix anyway.

459
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:50,636
[SPEAKER_07]: probably yeah but I mean but regardless you know there's episodes I believe up on uh WB's website not W why am I saying WB it's uh

460
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:53,376
[SPEAKER_05]: CW.

461
00:38:53,637 --> 00:38:55,198
[SPEAKER_07]: CW, yeah, on their website.

462
00:38:55,858 --> 00:38:57,499
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it's not like it's a big deal.

463
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:58,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hate commercials.

464
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:01,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's all about product placement.

465
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,563
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we have more product placement.

466
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:14,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did you hear about what they're doing with some of the old episodes of How I Met Your Mother and stuff like that where they're digitally altering them now where they're adding TVs and stuff in the background with stuff on them for different movies?

467
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:14,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-uh.

468
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:16,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's reruns of some of the 2009 episodes are like that.

469
00:39:18,354 --> 00:39:24,435
[SPEAKER_04]: with the zookeeper in the background or was it Country Strong or something like that?

470
00:39:25,336 --> 00:39:27,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't heard about that.

471
00:39:27,716 --> 00:39:31,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing in the world would get me to go see the zookeeper.

472
00:39:31,357 --> 00:39:37,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if someone threatened to kill my family if I wouldn't go watch the movie, then maybe I guess I would have to go see the movie.

473
00:39:37,218 --> 00:39:40,159
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd have to debate how much you love your family.

474
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,919
[SPEAKER_05]: There would be that moment of pause.

475
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:49,043
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, seriously, that movie looks so awful, I can't even.

476
00:39:50,103 --> 00:39:58,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, real quick, before we start jumping back into actual pertinent information, have you seen the trailer for Jack and Jill yet?

477
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:00,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

478
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:03,632
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a new Adam Sandler movie where he plays both Jack and Jill.

479
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:04,972
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I haven't heard that.

480
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:06,513
[SPEAKER_04]: You think the zookeeper looks bad.

481
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:11,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I... Does he have sex with himself?

482
00:40:11,197 --> 00:40:12,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Divine did that in the 70s.

483
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:14,000
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

484
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:14,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

485
00:40:16,142 --> 00:40:17,803
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks fucking terrible.

486
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:19,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get back to game stuff.

487
00:40:19,224 --> 00:40:19,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

488
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:20,626
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the Wii U?

489
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:21,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii U!

490
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:24,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about why was the Wii U shown?

491
00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:28,613
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of folks at E3, and I think I had said this too, when the Wii U was shown was said...

492
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:31,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo, maybe Nintendo did this too early.

493
00:40:31,998 --> 00:40:38,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they should have just waited until they actually had a little bit more to show, like, I don't know, some actual games and not just a bunch of concepts.

494
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:41,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo,

495
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:50,292
[SPEAKER_05]: has said that, you know what, maybe the Nintendo did show the Wii earlier than they had planned due to an increased fear of leaks.

496
00:40:50,312 --> 00:40:52,653
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean, fear of leaks?

497
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:53,753
[SPEAKER_05]: There were already leaks.

498
00:40:54,113 --> 00:40:55,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

499
00:40:55,874 --> 00:40:58,534
[SPEAKER_04]: What more could they have possibly leaked out about that system?

500
00:40:58,614 --> 00:40:59,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a quote.

501
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:07,657
[SPEAKER_05]: In the past, when Nintendo did not receive as much attention as we do now, we did not have to worry about the spread of our confidential information since it did not have any value in society.

502
00:41:07,997 --> 00:41:11,158
[SPEAKER_05]: But since the Nintendo DS and the Wii created a social phenomenon...

503
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:14,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how they kind of just slip that in there.

504
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

505
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Their whole social phenomenon.

506
00:41:17,482 --> 00:41:19,803
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's actually blowing smoke up their own ass.

507
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:22,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that's literally what they're doing in that statement.

508
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:28,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, since we decided that, you know, our systems are just revolutionizing the world.

509
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:32,012
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, you know, we would go as far as saying they're about to cure cancer.

510
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:33,953
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, hey.

511
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,742
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the fans are saying about our system.

512
00:41:38,603 --> 00:41:40,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Why doesn't he just say, thanks to the internet?

513
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:48,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Because back in the day, you would get the word from the Nintendo Fun Club or Nintendo Power, which ironically enough, we're also both Nintendo.

514
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:54,494
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand, because we're so awesome now... Let me show you this graphic behind me here.

515
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:58,838
[SPEAKER_04]: You see right here, we were awesome, but now we are like ten times as awesome.

516
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:00,139
[SPEAKER_04]: You do understand, that is...

517
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:01,220
[SPEAKER_04]: and much more.

518
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:26,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, Nintendo's next move commands great attention and extreme news value.

519
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:37,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, although we go to great lengths to ensure that this will not happen, there are cases where, even if a person receives information under a non-disclosure agreement, the information is leaked because there is great temptation.

520
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:46,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Even for the Wii U, some people may be aware, if they had been checking the internet, that information with true and false rumors mixed together was spread on the internet before the announcement.

521
00:42:47,013 --> 00:42:49,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So they kind of admit that, yeah, some of it was out there.

522
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:57,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, as for new hardware, even if we wanted to, it is extremely challenging to realize a situation where a product is announced and then launched the next day.

523
00:42:59,018 --> 00:43:01,339
[SPEAKER_05]: So, let's summarize that quote in our own words.

524
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:15,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we are so fucking awesome that everybody wants to report on our farts and has reported on our farts, we had to, you left us no choice but to get up on the E3 stage and fart.

525
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Wee!

526
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Wee!

527
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:24,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, they don't have to do shit.

528
00:43:24,847 --> 00:43:25,868
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have to do anything.

529
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,870
[SPEAKER_04]: They're succumbing to peer pressure.

530
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:29,810
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because they're farting.

531
00:43:50,183 --> 00:43:51,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called a guillotine.

532
00:43:51,303 --> 00:43:53,304
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called repercussions for people violating your NDA.

533
00:43:53,324 --> 00:43:55,344
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you have a nondisclosure agreement.

534
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:56,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Take those fuckers to court.

535
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in there, I mean, come on.

536
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know.

537
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:27,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you want to learn about the new Pokemon game?

538
00:44:27,853 --> 00:44:30,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad, because you're going to have to wait until after retail.

539
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:34,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Was Nintendo really worried about disappointing at E3 this year?

540
00:44:34,117 --> 00:44:39,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, like, seriously, Reggie could have just got up on stage and just hula-hooped for 30 minutes.

541
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:44,524
[SPEAKER_05]: And there would be that analysis on X-Play, like Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb.

542
00:44:44,924 --> 00:44:49,287
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the Wii Hoop, wasn't that an interesting display of, you know...

543
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:53,650
[SPEAKER_07]: A pelvic shaking from someone who doesn't need to shake his pelvis.

544
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I give those pelvic thrusts a 4 out of 5.

545
00:44:56,352 --> 00:44:59,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, if they didn't talk about the Wii U, what the fuck would they have talked about?

546
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:02,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Because seriously, they had nothing to announce this year.

547
00:45:02,957 --> 00:45:03,577
[SPEAKER_04]: They had nothing.

548
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:05,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, hey, yeah, well we

549
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:15,321
[SPEAKER_05]: They could have stretched the fuck out of those discussions of the Wii games that they didn't really show, like Rhythm Heaven and all the stuff that Wii Poo Poo.

550
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:17,041
[SPEAKER_05]: And would they have gotten slammed for that?

551
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:18,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

552
00:45:18,462 --> 00:45:23,883
[SPEAKER_05]: But then they could have shown the trailer for The Last Story or Xenoblade, which we all think is happening anyway.

553
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:29,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most of us going into E3 were pretty convinced that Nintendo was going to show The Last Story for an American release.

554
00:45:29,824 --> 00:45:35,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it so difficult if they're planning on working on that anyways, or they're planning on bringing that over, that they could announce that?

555
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:38,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if, you know what, they decide, hey, you know what, we're not going to bring it over here at some point.

556
00:45:39,288 --> 00:45:41,109
[SPEAKER_04]: If they change their minds, they can do that.

557
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:42,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Games get canceled all the time.

558
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at True Crime Hong Kong.

559
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:49,593
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a big old trailer for that during Activision's conference a couple years ago, but that game got canceled.

560
00:45:50,353 --> 00:45:52,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sucks that it got canceled, but you know what?

561
00:45:52,994 --> 00:45:53,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Games get canceled.

562
00:45:53,935 --> 00:45:58,837
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they decide, hey, we can announce this, but there may be a chance that we're not going to bring it over here,

563
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:00,096
[SPEAKER_04]: So what?

564
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:01,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So what?

565
00:46:01,317 --> 00:46:02,458
[SPEAKER_04]: At least you'd have something to announce.

566
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:06,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of saying, hey, I hear you guys like Smash Brothers.

567
00:46:06,282 --> 00:46:06,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what?

568
00:46:07,062 --> 00:46:11,786
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to work on Smash Brothers sometime in the next couple years.

569
00:46:12,427 --> 00:46:15,490
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, thanks, I think.

570
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:43,693
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru in our chatroom at chat.org.com says they could have focused on the 3DS you know and they kind of did for half their conference their conference this year was the Zelda thing which that did feel like a bunch of hot air like I'm sorry but the whole Zelda thing it's like okay you've been showing this game for like four years and the whole symphony thing and all that was really just dragging it out like we know you're fucking showing the Wii U this is just you know this is literally just pomp and circumstance about how fucking great Nintendo is

571
00:46:44,053 --> 00:46:45,574
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the great thing about Nintendo.

572
00:46:45,795 --> 00:46:47,356
[SPEAKER_05]: They could have done pomp and circumstance.

573
00:46:47,636 --> 00:46:52,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they could have done, like, symphonic announcements for all those 3DS games.

574
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:57,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they could have had somebody dressed up as... They could have had Ranma, Black Luigi, come out and go, Hello!

575
00:46:58,006 --> 00:46:59,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And look for the ghost.

576
00:46:59,547 --> 00:47:02,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is Miyamoto with the fucking shield and sword?

577
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:03,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's, like, just, like...

578
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:10,012
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the kind of crazy batshit stuff that they need to be doing again to get people excited about the games.

579
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:18,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you know, every time I see them put out a new Mario Kart Animal Crossing game or something like that, I mean, really, what the fuck are they doing?

580
00:47:18,594 --> 00:47:24,055
[SPEAKER_04]: They're adding some more useless garbage on top of these games, and then they're re-releasing them back out into the market.

581
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:29,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, hey, look, I know you guys wanted Star Fox, so we're going to give you Star Fox that we gave you before.

582
00:47:30,655 --> 00:47:31,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome!

583
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:33,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I hear you guys like Mario Brothers.

584
00:47:33,598 --> 00:47:35,919
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give you Mario Brothers 64 HD.

585
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Or in 3D.

586
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:39,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks?

587
00:47:39,843 --> 00:47:49,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just... It's kind of annoying that they've got... I mean, to me, I understand that there's a whole place where, hey, you know what?

588
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:49,771
[SPEAKER_04]: These games are good.

589
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:59,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's re-release them for a new generation or some garbage that you want to spew saying that basically, oh, well, we've run out of ideas, so we're just going to take some of these old games and put them back out again.

590
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:05,961
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to put as minimal amount of effort into them to make them look new again, but we're going to put them back out there because this is what the fans want.

591
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:07,881
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

592
00:48:09,682 --> 00:48:11,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Fans, let me just talk to you here real quick.

593
00:48:12,883 --> 00:48:13,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's something that you can do.

594
00:48:13,783 --> 00:48:14,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

595
00:48:15,124 --> 00:48:20,065
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that those consoles, when people are done playing them, they're still out there.

596
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,786
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't just evaporate.

597
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:23,466
[SPEAKER_04]: They are out there.

598
00:48:23,486 --> 00:48:26,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were all in a landfill in New Mexico.

599
00:48:26,267 --> 00:48:26,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so crazy.

600
00:48:27,308 --> 00:48:27,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know

601
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:34,870
[SPEAKER_04]: That if you want to play Ocarina of Time, you don't have to spend $299 plus $40 for the game.

602
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:35,371
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

603
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:36,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know.

604
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:37,071
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a shocker.

605
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:38,972
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what Beyonce told me in the ad.

606
00:48:39,232 --> 00:48:39,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

607
00:48:40,432 --> 00:48:41,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But Beyonce's full of shit.

608
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:43,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's all you have to do.

609
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,485
[SPEAKER_04]: You can literally go out to your local garage sales or there's this website out there called eBay where people sell things.

610
00:48:50,505 --> 00:48:53,247
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a game that Robin Williams named his daughter after.

611
00:48:53,387 --> 00:48:54,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, isn't that worth $300?

612
00:48:54,147 --> 00:48:56,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but Robin Williams is kind of crazy.

613
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:57,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't you see the crazy beard?

614
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:59,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's starting to look like a homeless crazy beard, okay?

615
00:48:59,852 --> 00:49:00,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little bit.

616
00:49:00,392 --> 00:49:00,872
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little weird.

617
00:49:00,952 --> 00:49:01,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I see where you're going with that.

618
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:03,534
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like beyond Santa Claus.

619
00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:04,415
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an interesting angle.

620
00:49:04,595 --> 00:49:04,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know.

621
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:10,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so you can go on eBay and you can buy a Nintendo 64 and Ocarina of Time.

622
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?

623
00:49:13,726 --> 00:49:15,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Just be careful that it's not coming from China.

624
00:49:16,009 --> 00:49:16,730
[SPEAKER_04]: For a limited amount of time.

625
00:49:16,891 --> 00:49:23,880
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also probably afford within that $299 price range about, I don't know, 40 other games.

626
00:49:25,535 --> 00:49:30,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can play it all on your... You could buy everything on the Steam Marketplace right now for $299.

627
00:49:30,977 --> 00:49:32,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can play it.

628
00:49:32,477 --> 00:49:34,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, it won't be in 3D, but you know what?

629
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, wrong.

630
00:49:37,499 --> 00:49:38,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

631
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know what?

632
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:43,361
[SPEAKER_04]: You're playing with it the way it was meant to be played on Nintendo 64.

633
00:49:45,302 --> 00:50:06,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why that's the whole thing with the 25th anniversary collection or whatever that $40 could have easily bought you $40 could have bought you a Super Nintendo we need to do a mock commercial for 3DS Ocarina of Time that has the whole like interspersed Robin Williams and his daughter and I'll play the game the way it was meant to be played just $19.99 on eBay

634
00:50:08,404 --> 00:50:09,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even 1999.

635
00:50:10,224 --> 00:50:12,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

636
00:50:13,165 --> 00:50:16,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been different if it was something like, hey, you know what?

637
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,886
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to bring out a Zelda anthology.

638
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:22,427
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have Zelda 1, Zelda 2, all of them on one disc.

639
00:50:22,727 --> 00:50:25,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they kind of did for the pre-order thing for Wind Waker.

640
00:50:25,348 --> 00:50:27,188
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a pre-order bonus!

641
00:50:27,568 --> 00:50:28,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Pre-order bonus!

642
00:50:28,968 --> 00:50:33,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff that nowadays is just like a code for a shirt for my character in game.

643
00:50:34,109 --> 00:50:36,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Or armor that's red instead of silver.

644
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:36,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

645
00:50:38,254 --> 00:50:42,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Why couldn't they just... They could sell that disc!

646
00:50:42,816 --> 00:51:00,384
[SPEAKER_04]: They could easily just stuff a couple more games on there, put Wind Waker in the box or something like that, because that game hasn't been sold forever, throw Twilight Princess back in there because, hey, you know what, just in case maybe someone doesn't have it, you know, and a little bit of extra content, and holy crap, that's a great deal and actually worth my time.

647
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:04,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And hell, you don't have to do anything to them because people like the games the way they were.

648
00:51:06,826 --> 00:51:17,419
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, they need an excuse for people to buy the 3DS because the 3DS is kind of a gimmicky system and so what a better way to do that is to take one of their most popular Zelda games and just put it back out there.

649
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:18,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Reggie Fils-Aimé

650
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,060
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to welcome arguments?

651
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:09,322
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

652
00:52:25,496 --> 00:52:28,599
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, I don't see any publishers having trouble working with Xbox One.

653
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:37,388
[SPEAKER_05]: This is funny because this does tie into something topical and it's the whole EA versus Steam thing that's going on that, yes, I realize comes up later in the show, but just deal.

654
00:52:38,749 --> 00:52:42,473
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this whole thing going back and forth with EA and Steam right now where Steam doesn't want the...

655
00:52:43,313 --> 00:53:00,016
[SPEAKER_05]: or Steam has forbidden the EA games to come on the marketplace for Steam and a lot of it has to do with the fact that EA wants to have their own servers for their own patches and EA wants it all to themselves and this was a big sticking point early on with Microsoft in the early days of Xbox Live.

656
00:53:00,456 --> 00:53:07,417
[SPEAKER_05]: So Nintendo in a way can kind of point at that and say we're not being lazy we're just doing what EA wants.

657
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:10,738
[SPEAKER_05]: No they are being lazy because guess what EA who did they bring out on stage?

658
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:11,901
[SPEAKER_04]: E.A.

659
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:12,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But guess what?

660
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:13,342
[SPEAKER_04]: E.A.

661
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:14,723
[SPEAKER_04]: is still doing that, though.

662
00:53:15,143 --> 00:53:15,383
[SPEAKER_04]: E.A.

663
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,865
[SPEAKER_04]: has their own, like, you have to sign in through the E.A.

664
00:53:17,925 --> 00:53:19,946
[SPEAKER_04]: service or whatever in order to play the E.A.

665
00:53:19,986 --> 00:53:20,807
[SPEAKER_04]: games online.

666
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:21,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

667
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:22,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, remember, Project $10.

668
00:53:22,868 --> 00:53:24,669
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all part of that fun stuff.

669
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And then same with, like...

670
00:53:28,451 --> 00:53:34,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's some other services that Ubisoft has their kind of thing where you have to log into as well.

671
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:40,214
[SPEAKER_04]: But EA, I know for a fact they have their EA games login that you have to do.

672
00:53:40,294 --> 00:53:42,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have their own thing on top of this.

673
00:53:42,435 --> 00:53:48,776
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that they don't have a unified service or something like that is basically Nintendo's way of saying, we don't know what we're doing.

674
00:53:49,016 --> 00:53:49,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

675
00:53:49,437 --> 00:53:54,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's kind of what it is because they don't want to invest time into some sort of service like that and have it be inferior to Ubisoft.

676
00:53:54,878 --> 00:54:13,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they sort of brought out the guy from EA, coincidentally enough, at E3, and I got the sense that, like, I don't know how much, I can't remember now how much was said about online, but I remember walking away from that, getting the sense that, like, I was actually asking myself for a minute, like, is EA doing their online stuff?

677
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, is EA going to be doing the online stuff for Nintendo?

678
00:54:16,264 --> 00:54:16,805
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't that at all.

679
00:54:16,845 --> 00:54:21,746
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know that's not what they ended up, but that was, like, for a moment, that was the impression I was getting about what was being said.

680
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:23,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they didn't really bring up their online stuff.

681
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:26,928
[SPEAKER_04]: All it really, to me, said is, hey, look, we have EA on board.

682
00:54:26,948 --> 00:54:28,548
[SPEAKER_04]: They believe in our system.

683
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:31,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And EA is one of the biggest publishers in the world.

684
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,130
[SPEAKER_04]: So you all should believe in our system.

685
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you see the math?

686
00:54:37,871 --> 00:54:39,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they believe in us, you have to believe in us.

687
00:54:40,672 --> 00:54:52,362
[SPEAKER_05]: When Nintendo would like to ask users to try a specific new game, we should deliver it to their Nintendo 3DS and possibly Wii U with their prior consent and recommend that they just try it, and if they like it, they can pay for it.

688
00:55:07,154 --> 00:55:10,458
[SPEAKER_05]: In this way, we need to introduce users to unknown products.

689
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:20,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Consumers are likely to be convinced to pay about 5,000 yen for a well-established franchise product, but not all the people are willing to pay a certain amount of money for an innovative but unknown product.

690
00:55:20,928 --> 00:55:22,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Now is the time to prepare for these situations.

691
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:28,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's interesting about that is Nintendo is basically saying, we need to find a way to just put demos on people's systems.

692
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:29,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, he does it.

693
00:55:29,897 --> 00:55:34,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there is a very important quote before you run away with this that says, you know, with their prior consent.

694
00:55:34,923 --> 00:55:35,704
[SPEAKER_04]: They're already doing this.

695
00:55:35,764 --> 00:55:40,469
[SPEAKER_04]: They're already doing this on the 3DS as far as like, because the stupid Pokemon thing downloaded to mine.

696
00:55:40,529 --> 00:55:41,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't want this fucking shit.

697
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:43,533
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it didn't download automatically, did it?

698
00:55:43,553 --> 00:55:44,514
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to get it through the store.

699
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:45,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to get mine through the store.

700
00:55:45,715 --> 00:55:47,016
[SPEAKER_05]: No, mine downloaded automatically.

701
00:55:47,036 --> 00:55:47,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

702
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:51,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that OK Go video came in on one of the patches automatically, and then it was taken away.

703
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:52,519
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not a big deal.

704
00:55:52,539 --> 00:55:54,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they have the same type of thing right now.

705
00:55:54,539 --> 00:55:57,360
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I think it's still around on Xbox Live Arcade.

706
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:02,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, you could sign up, basically, and have all the demos for the games that come out downloaded to your system, and you could try them.

707
00:56:02,782 --> 00:56:03,682
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like them, then you buy them.

708
00:56:04,022 --> 00:56:04,783
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

709
00:56:28,503 --> 00:56:31,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Nintendo, a company that they've said, hey, you know what?

710
00:56:32,467 --> 00:56:33,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Our games are so awesome.

711
00:56:33,909 --> 00:56:34,269
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember?

712
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Chart 10 times awesome as before.

713
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,534
[SPEAKER_04]: That we don't need demos for them.

714
00:56:38,814 --> 00:56:42,998
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to, you know, we're putting that stuff out there and you're going to see Nintendo and you're like, oh, I got to buy that.

715
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now they realize, hey, you know what?

716
00:56:46,942 --> 00:56:50,546
[SPEAKER_04]: People like playing demos to see if your game's crap or not.

717
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:55,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I like demos and hate crap.

718
00:56:57,007 --> 00:56:58,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like crappy demos?

719
00:56:59,069 --> 00:56:59,209
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

720
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:00,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on with more news.

721
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I like them because I don't have to pay for them.

722
00:57:02,712 --> 00:57:05,014
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, while you're at it, why don't you give us some more gaming news?

723
00:57:05,754 --> 00:57:07,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about some Zuni stuff?

724
00:57:08,464 --> 00:57:14,947
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a rumor that the Zune Marketplace is being revamped on Xbox 360 as a streaming video service.

725
00:57:15,608 --> 00:57:22,511
[SPEAKER_07]: And it already had the ability to stream, but this is specifically for some sort of service they're going to be offering.

726
00:57:22,531 --> 00:57:26,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe something along the lines of Netflix, but this of course is under the Zune brand.

727
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:33,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft basically saying no comment, blah blah blah.

728
00:57:33,837 --> 00:57:34,057
[SPEAKER_07]: But

729
00:57:35,317 --> 00:57:36,278
[SPEAKER_07]: It could already be happening.

730
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:45,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this could be related to what they were announcing at E3 at their press conference or maybe related to Xbox Live Diamond.

731
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:46,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

732
00:57:47,721 --> 00:57:49,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, okay, I already have Netflix.

733
00:57:50,396 --> 00:57:52,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know... I already have Hulu.

734
00:57:52,857 --> 00:57:57,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox has been kind of centralizing a lot of their stuff lately and kind of folding in dated brands.

735
00:57:57,778 --> 00:58:01,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we had the story last week about Game for Windows kind of becoming Xbox.com.

736
00:58:01,459 --> 00:58:05,301
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact, you know, didn't Xbox stop making the Zune like about a year and a half ago?

737
00:58:05,461 --> 00:58:05,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

738
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:09,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's no surprise at all that something had to happen to the Zune marketplace, so...

739
00:58:10,242 --> 00:58:14,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and it makes sense to me because I look at even like the PlayStation Network and stuff.

740
00:58:14,184 --> 00:58:17,326
[SPEAKER_04]: They have, I don't even know how many streaming services on there.

741
00:58:17,346 --> 00:58:17,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony has one.

742
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:24,691
[SPEAKER_04]: They have Vudu and Netflix and I'm sure Hulu Plus is on there.

743
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:26,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't even know.

744
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a few other ones on top of that.

745
00:58:28,073 --> 00:58:32,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes sense that they would have a few different offerings on the Xbox marketplace as well.

746
00:58:32,616 --> 00:58:34,117
[SPEAKER_07]: They got to do something with that Zoom name.

747
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I would imagine that they're not going to call it the Zune.

748
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:43,266
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably just going to have some Microsoft streaming service or something like that.

749
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:46,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

750
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:47,250
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of funny.

751
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how we talked about Gears War 3 leaking out last week?

752
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:54,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, who possibly could have leaked this out?

753
00:58:55,077 --> 00:58:58,861
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, it's funny because it was leaked out by a...

754
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:27,671
[SPEAKER_04]: a third party I guess outsource company that was storing the code on their website Codify they're an Australian based hosting company which lists Microsoft as a client and it literally was behind no protection whatsoever all you had to do was go to xbox.codify.com which is now obviously locked up and you can literally find the code right there

755
00:59:29,051 --> 00:59:33,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go and download the whole folders and everything.

756
00:59:33,074 --> 00:59:35,175
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just ripe for the picking.

757
00:59:35,235 --> 00:59:36,716
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just straight up embarrassing.

758
00:59:37,377 --> 00:59:39,018
[SPEAKER_05]: That is pretty bad.

759
00:59:39,298 --> 00:59:40,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even a login or password.

760
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:42,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

761
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,801
[SPEAKER_05]: The password wasn't password.

762
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:45,442
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just no password.

763
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:46,683
[SPEAKER_04]: No login, no password.

764
00:59:46,823 --> 00:59:47,584
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just straight up.

765
00:59:47,604 --> 00:59:48,964
[SPEAKER_04]: There was confidential in the folder.

766
00:59:49,105 --> 00:59:50,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, please.

767
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:53,127
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a dopey thing to do.

768
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:56,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone's head's rolling for that decision.

769
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:58,591
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just a lazy, dumb thing to do.

770
00:59:59,731 --> 01:00:00,072
[SPEAKER_05]: It is pretty bad.

771
01:00:14,637 --> 01:00:22,043
[SPEAKER_05]: and clearly this company has no security officer, cyber security person, specialist.

772
01:00:22,343 --> 01:00:26,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly this company has none of that or that person has been on vacation for six months.

773
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:30,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I mean, you could seriously host this stuff on...

774
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,421
[SPEAKER_04]: on any of these file sharing sites.

775
01:00:34,681 --> 01:00:42,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, they could have used a site like Mega Upload or something like that, some ridiculously stupid website.

776
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:44,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And at least that you can put a password on.

777
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:46,802
[SPEAKER_04]: This site, nothing.

778
01:00:47,242 --> 01:00:50,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Randy in our chatroom says, somewhere an employee is being yelled at.

779
01:00:50,665 --> 01:00:55,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say somewhere in a Microsoft meeting, an agreement is being terminated with this company.

780
01:00:56,128 --> 01:00:56,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say that.

781
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:03,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a lot more serious, and then people at that said company are going to lose their jobs.

782
01:01:03,153 --> 01:01:06,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And the sad thing is, it's not going to be anybody involved with this.

783
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:07,456
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be the...

784
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,397
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the fault of the executive who didn't hire a privacy person.

785
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:17,960
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny, too, is not only was the game leaked, but there was some of the tools that they used for the game as well leaked with it.

786
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez.

787
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,000
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

788
01:01:21,001 --> 01:01:22,921
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just sad.

789
01:01:24,002 --> 01:01:24,342
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

790
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:32,025
[SPEAKER_05]: These rumors will never go away, but we've got to address them because it's making the way around the game blogs.

791
01:01:32,825 --> 01:01:46,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, Taiwan-based component makers, according to Digitimes, have said that the PlayStation 4 will feature body movement control, similar to Kinect, and it's going to be released in 2012.

792
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:51,966
[SPEAKER_05]: This is coming from Foxconn and... I'm sorry, it's not coming from, but the...

793
01:01:52,927 --> 01:01:59,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Report is further saying that Foxconn and Pegatron Technology, who make the PS3, they will also be working on the PlayStation 4.

794
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:04,312
[SPEAKER_05]: The shipment volume of the PlayStation 4 in 2012 is supposed to be at least 20 million units.

795
01:02:05,372 --> 01:02:06,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

796
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:10,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly, the PlayStation 4 is coming out as soon as next year.

797
01:02:11,855 --> 01:02:14,436
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few things that seem a little weird about that.

798
01:02:14,757 --> 01:02:19,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Very well, let's say if it was actually coming out next year, then yes, it would probably have to be starting production right now on that.

799
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:26,401
[SPEAKER_04]: But a few things that seem kind of off on that is the fact that they're looking to ship 20 million units.

800
01:02:26,461 --> 01:02:31,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even if it was 20 million units worldwide, no console launch has been that big.

801
01:02:31,784 --> 01:02:32,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Never that big.

802
01:02:32,984 --> 01:02:37,826
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be a lot of units just sitting there, a lot of wasted resources.

803
01:02:37,866 --> 01:02:42,268
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to want to have that launch, basically, the numbers as...

804
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,009
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

805
01:03:06,508 --> 01:03:08,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that would be a lot, just like right away.

806
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:11,730
[SPEAKER_04]: So 20 million, that seems wrong.

807
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:18,452
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that strikes me as odd about this story is the whole it will feature body movement control like Microsoft's Kinect.

808
01:03:19,113 --> 01:03:25,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at that a little bit through side-eye because that would show me that Sony has already abandoned the move.

809
01:03:26,315 --> 01:03:27,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't doubt that they would, though.

810
01:03:27,576 --> 01:03:28,336
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

811
01:03:29,377 --> 01:03:50,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little yes and no on that I mean the move definitely probably is not broken through the way it should have or the way that Kinect has but at the same time I don't I don't know there's a part of me that wants to say Kinect hasn't really proven itself but at the same time yes it is the fastest selling hardware despite the you know I feel like the Kinect is in the rut that the Wii was in at the same time we all should have seen it coming

812
01:03:50,539 --> 01:04:17,813
[SPEAKER_04]: that you know after the initial wave of games there's just kind of a bunch of finger tapping on the desk there's not a lot and not a lot that we got excited about at E3 this year either there will be some stuff coming out but yeah it's not it's not really a lot of stuff that's diverting from what's already out there you know there's gonna be dancing games because obviously those have done well there's gonna be sports games because those have done well there's gonna be you know kind of the same type of fairy that you would see on like the Wii because that's just what's working um

813
01:04:18,954 --> 01:04:29,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and the other thing you also have to consider too is that they're still making PS3s, and the PS3 is going to be their push, especially with the fourth quarter that they have right now.

814
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:37,685
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be wanting to have tons of PS3 units, and it's going to be hard to have two systems being manufactured at the same time.

815
01:04:40,287 --> 01:04:42,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see it happening this soon.

816
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:44,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're just going to stick to their 10-year plan.

817
01:04:44,788 --> 01:04:46,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they kind of did that with the move.

818
01:04:46,188 --> 01:04:49,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if they've really tapped out yet with what they can do on the PS3.

819
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:50,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope not.

820
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:53,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they can do a lot more.

821
01:04:53,891 --> 01:05:03,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's still at the end of the day, it's still a cheap Blu-ray player for a lot of people that, you know, are as Blu-ray is getting into more and more homes as HDTV is getting more and more homes.

822
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:08,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, Sony still has that advantage that they're the only ones as a Blu-ray player still at the end of the day.

823
01:05:09,504 --> 01:05:14,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, and I think that's been helping move a lot more units than they might want to admit.

824
01:05:15,466 --> 01:05:18,807
[SPEAKER_05]: That they would probably chalk up to the quality of the games and so forth.

825
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,408
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the fact that it's a Blu-ray player has been really moving it.

826
01:05:21,688 --> 01:05:23,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So where the hell does the story come from?

827
01:05:23,148 --> 01:05:24,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just a bunch of bullshit?

828
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:30,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Or could it maybe be that there's some type of new PlayStation 3 redesign in the works?

829
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:33,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see that before I would believe that a PlayStation 4 is in the works.

830
01:05:34,032 --> 01:05:35,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Like yet another PlayStation 3 Slim.

831
01:05:37,573 --> 01:05:40,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe with Move more integrated into it or something.

832
01:05:40,316 --> 01:05:46,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they would do that, but I don't buy this yet.

833
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:49,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than someone saying, oh, well, this is what's going to happen.

834
01:05:49,305 --> 01:05:56,393
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't seen any... Like with the Foxconn announcements, usually a lot of that will see pictures of the motherboards or something like that for these and

835
01:05:57,213 --> 01:05:59,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, some sort of physical evidence for it.

836
01:05:59,635 --> 01:06:05,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Because right now, just one person saying that that works because you work at a... I mean, you don't even know if you work there.

837
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:11,744
[SPEAKER_04]: To just say that you're a worker for one of these places doesn't necessarily... I don't know.

838
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:13,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I can trust that source.

839
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:17,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just be willing to bet right now that it's probably...

840
01:06:19,683 --> 01:06:23,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be a while still before we see the new console.

841
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:26,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless, of course, the Wii U really takes off.

842
01:06:26,227 --> 01:06:29,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going to have to speed things along a bit.

843
01:06:30,451 --> 01:06:36,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, with the Wii U, I don't think it's going to all of a sudden just take over.

844
01:06:36,495 --> 01:06:36,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

845
01:06:37,976 --> 01:06:43,400
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii is still the number one selling console right now, but I don't think it's... I don't think it is anymore.

846
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:43,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

847
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:51,586
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the monthly numbers, I think... I haven't been able to look at the NPD reports that have changed, so I haven't gotten to see a lot of stuff, but, you know...

848
01:06:53,808 --> 01:06:58,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's still cumulatively the top overall, but it's not the month-to-month bestseller.

849
01:06:58,651 --> 01:06:59,151
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I meant.

850
01:06:59,272 --> 01:07:01,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, it's the largest selling system.

851
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:10,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that this Wii U is going to be able to pull Wii numbers again.

852
01:07:11,179 --> 01:07:19,283
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like, well, we've already seen that, and yeah, the tablet thing is a little bit new, but I don't know if it's going to be enough to get people into it.

853
01:07:19,323 --> 01:07:20,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look at the 3DS.

854
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:21,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect example.

855
01:07:22,565 --> 01:07:23,907
[SPEAKER_04]: The 3D's new.

856
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:33,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, if all things were correct, if they had a good launch lineup, I think that thing should have done really well, but they just aren't utilizing it enough.

857
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:34,539
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D looks okay, but...

858
01:07:37,422 --> 01:07:38,043
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just nothing.

859
01:07:38,243 --> 01:07:40,525
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I kind of seen the tilt controls.

860
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:41,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen that before.

861
01:07:42,247 --> 01:07:43,368
[SPEAKER_04]: All this stuff, I've seen this before.

862
01:07:43,408 --> 01:07:44,509
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not new.

863
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:46,371
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

864
01:07:47,151 --> 01:07:48,032
[SPEAKER_05]: One more story for you guys.

865
01:07:48,052 --> 01:07:52,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're going to travel around the world and look at release dates and what's coming out in a country near you.

866
01:07:52,376 --> 01:07:53,377
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, releases.

867
01:07:53,758 --> 01:07:54,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

868
01:07:54,118 --> 01:07:55,239
[SPEAKER_05]: First, a story from Dark Sakura.

869
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Then releases.

870
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I was about to say, what are you doing skipping my story?

871
01:07:59,861 --> 01:08:08,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the PSP had a digital comic service and Sony said, nope, not anymore, cut.

872
01:08:08,883 --> 01:08:10,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is going away.

873
01:08:11,524 --> 01:08:23,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It has over 4,000 different comic book issues on it, but the digital comics is going away, for the PSP at least.

874
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:27,610
[SPEAKER_07]: It may go to other Sony devices, but not to the PSP.

875
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:32,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're getting ready to transition to VitaLand.

876
01:08:35,461 --> 01:08:36,041
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

877
01:09:03,499 --> 01:09:03,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

878
01:09:32,488 --> 01:09:33,249
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I see it.

879
01:09:33,309 --> 01:09:40,795
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, I really don't care because you have to be really careful when doing comics for a small screen format.

880
01:09:42,196 --> 01:09:44,058
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes you lose something.

881
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe at the end of the day, they just weren't selling.

882
01:09:47,554 --> 01:09:48,835
[SPEAKER_05]: IOS Digital Distribution Digital Distribution

883
01:10:05,603 --> 01:10:06,044
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be.

884
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:09,928
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, I've had a few different comic book readers on my iPhone.

885
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:18,458
[SPEAKER_07]: But the ones that I always thought were the best well done were the ones that were standalone releases through the...

886
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,141
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

887
01:10:46,693 --> 01:10:48,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com.

888
01:10:48,814 --> 01:10:51,616
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually a little bit of love going on for Marvel's digital service.

889
01:10:51,676 --> 01:10:54,457
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Dollar Bill says, I like Marvel's digital service.

890
01:10:55,097 --> 01:10:57,879
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru says, I started using Marvel's digital service myself.

891
01:10:58,599 --> 01:11:00,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Robert M in our chatroom says, stinks.

892
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Will the PSP app still be available for back issues?

893
01:11:02,821 --> 01:11:03,422
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good question.

894
01:11:03,882 --> 01:11:05,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the app's still going to be there.

895
01:11:05,283 --> 01:11:07,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why they would close the app.

896
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:13,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would imagine there are agreements with the publishers to allow it so that if you have purchased a comic, you get to keep it.

897
01:11:13,749 --> 01:11:15,310
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no reason for them to take it down.

898
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,111
[SPEAKER_07]: They said nothing about taking it down.

899
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:18,652
[SPEAKER_07]: They just are going to stop supporting it.

900
01:11:18,892 --> 01:11:19,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

901
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,054
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be like Microsoft Game Room.

902
01:11:21,394 --> 01:11:26,637
[SPEAKER_05]: If you really want to go into Game Room and download a lot of the old games, you can, but a new game hasn't come out in about a year now.

903
01:11:27,018 --> 01:11:31,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but they're not going to deny people who have already used the service because that would just be really crappy.

904
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:32,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

905
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:33,002
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly it.

906
01:11:34,091 --> 01:11:48,708
[SPEAKER_07]: and for the record, Marvel's digital comic service is really nice very easy to use and I've caught up on Avengers West Coast very quickly with that one of these days I'll get me an iPad and I'll check that out but we'll see

907
01:11:50,248 --> 01:11:51,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Moise off from that.

908
01:11:51,209 --> 01:11:53,811
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go travel the world and look at some release dates.

909
01:11:53,871 --> 01:11:56,112
[SPEAKER_05]: What is coming to a gaming store near you?

910
01:11:56,192 --> 01:11:58,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, start us off with the U.S.

911
01:11:59,074 --> 01:12:00,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot this week.

912
01:12:00,555 --> 01:12:04,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off with NCAA football for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

913
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:10,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Gods and Heroes Rome Rising Collector's Edition out this week on PC.

914
01:12:12,044 --> 01:12:12,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

915
01:12:12,684 --> 01:12:18,068
[SPEAKER_04]: The Elder Scrolls Oblivion 5th Anniversary Edition with a nice little map in there and some DLC stuff.

916
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:42,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus $10 towards Skyrim And that's only $30 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PC UFC Personal Trainer on the Wii And let's see here

917
01:12:44,133 --> 01:12:45,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually it.

918
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:21,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Wangan Midnight gets a price reduction on July 14th it moves into the PlayStation 3 best as does White Knight Chronicles 2 moves into the best series and I believe the American or the Europe release of that is not too far away I've been reading some early reviews on it that have not been too kind

919
01:13:22,758 --> 01:13:32,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Also on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan, Brink and Tencho no Eagle, as well as GQ Powerful Pro Yaku 2011 comes out this week.

920
01:13:32,785 --> 01:13:37,809
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a baseball game from Konami with chibi little characters.

921
01:13:38,449 --> 01:13:40,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a series I believe we have over here.

922
01:13:41,191 --> 01:13:42,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at some of the other systems.

923
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:45,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to see if there's actually anything on the Wii at all.

924
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:47,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

925
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:48,555
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have the PSP.

926
01:13:49,236 --> 01:13:53,598
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Taiko no Tatoujin Portable DX comes out.

927
01:13:54,398 --> 01:13:58,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Music game fans may recognize that as the Taiko drumming game.

928
01:13:58,661 --> 01:14:01,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like there's a new version of that on its way to the PSP this week in Japan.

929
01:14:02,143 --> 01:14:05,144
[SPEAKER_05]: As well as Unchained Blades Rex comes out this week.

930
01:14:05,725 --> 01:14:05,865
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

931
01:14:06,845 --> 01:14:31,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Ys gets price reductions all over the place as they move into the best series Ys 1 and 2, Ys 7 and Ys vs Sora no Kisuke Alternative Saga all those are getting price reductions this week so if you're an Ys fan that's late to the party in Japan good news, you get to get in cheap now Ys 3 is the best one game of note on the Wii it's coming out on July 16th from level 5 Inazuma 11 Strikers

932
01:14:33,986 --> 01:14:36,327
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sports game coming out from level 5.

933
01:14:36,707 --> 01:14:37,468
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a soccer game.

934
01:14:38,108 --> 01:14:42,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like it incorporates characters from various other games and anime.

935
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:46,632
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like kind of like a fan wank soccer game.

936
01:14:47,312 --> 01:14:47,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

937
01:14:49,353 --> 01:14:52,374
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on with the UK dates.

938
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:55,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2

939
01:15:22,011 --> 01:15:22,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Told ya.

940
01:15:51,944 --> 01:15:56,329
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this isn't the first time now that I think of it that Capcom has fucked up a save system.

941
01:15:56,349 --> 01:15:58,011
[SPEAKER_04]: You may remember Dead Rising 1.

942
01:15:59,273 --> 01:16:00,654
[SPEAKER_04]: They had real issues with that.

943
01:16:00,674 --> 01:16:04,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, do you guys not know how to program save games correctly?

944
01:16:04,959 --> 01:16:06,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that really a problem for you?

945
01:16:06,921 --> 01:16:26,133
[SPEAKER_04]: um but they're saying though um it that their intent was never quite malicious um you know despite the conspiracy theories out there that would have you believe and uh that they said that the inability to reset saves was a conscious design decision aimed at maintaining the arcade fighter feeling of the title

946
01:16:27,314 --> 01:16:28,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so much bullshit.

947
01:16:28,635 --> 01:16:31,597
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just ridiculous.

948
01:16:31,897 --> 01:16:39,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Although they did release this statement, and now I'm wondering, I don't know if it's bullshit so much as it just was a dumb decision.

949
01:16:40,325 --> 01:16:45,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if somebody didn't really say, we don't need to program in the save-delete thing.

950
01:16:45,929 --> 01:16:46,569
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like an arcade.

951
01:16:46,589 --> 01:16:47,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just skip that part.

952
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a dumb decision.

953
01:16:49,431 --> 01:17:02,840
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a device out there, though, that will actually erase those save games that I saw out there because there was an article I saw where they're recommending, well, one of the two ways you can delete your save games, one, through the game to a campfire, two, use this device.

954
01:17:03,421 --> 01:17:09,164
[SPEAKER_04]: The device apparently allows you to backup game saves on 3DS and DS and also allows you to erase them.

955
01:17:11,331 --> 01:17:13,092
[SPEAKER_04]: They could easily just fix this with a patch.

956
01:17:13,832 --> 01:17:16,333
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, 3DS games are... You can patch those.

957
01:17:16,614 --> 01:17:18,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, Capcom, you can patch them.

958
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:20,075
[SPEAKER_04]: You do this shit on consoles.

959
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:22,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, why don't you just say, hey, you know what?

960
01:17:23,377 --> 01:17:24,017
[SPEAKER_04]: We fucked up.

961
01:17:24,197 --> 01:17:26,618
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys want your save, reset stuff.

962
01:17:26,698 --> 01:17:27,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what.

963
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,540
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go ahead and patch it in so you can reset your saves.

964
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,201
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, they're being dicks, so... Fine.

965
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:33,001
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

966
01:17:33,342 --> 01:17:37,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't going to buy this game anyways, and... Even less reason to do so now.

967
01:17:38,184 --> 01:17:39,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's kind of one of those games that...

968
01:17:40,426 --> 01:17:43,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably wouldn't have bought it anyway, but I especially am not gonna buy it now.

969
01:17:44,221 --> 01:17:51,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on to a story that's actually, I think this is kind of one of those pretty awesome stories I want to talk about here.

970
01:17:51,024 --> 01:17:55,707
[SPEAKER_05]: And this has to do with Dr. Stephen Hicks, who is a clinical neurologist at the University of Oxford.

971
01:17:56,647 --> 01:18:04,391
[SPEAKER_05]: He is working on some glasses that has technology that's inspired by Xbox 360 Kinect games, iPads.

972
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:09,733
[SPEAKER_05]: And what these glasses are, they're to help blind folks see shapes and people better.

973
01:18:10,134 --> 01:18:12,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And it uses the technology of the Kinect and the iPads.

974
01:18:13,836 --> 01:18:41,872
[SPEAKER_05]: It's mostly for folks that can detect light But they can't fully see The glasses would use these cameras That would be on corners of the lenses To detect the information And then it would send it to a little computer Because everything is so tiny these days I guess it's all in the glasses The computer will then translate the information And transmit it to LEDs inside the lenses of the glasses And those LEDs would light up in patterns That you would be trained to understand

975
01:18:42,973 --> 01:18:43,473
[SPEAKER_05]: The Visor

976
01:19:09,887 --> 01:19:10,567
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

977
01:19:29,773 --> 01:19:30,834
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

978
01:19:54,364 --> 01:20:04,153
[SPEAKER_05]: and so a person wearing these glasses, the laser could scan that QR code from a distance and tell that person in their ear, this is the bus that goes to market, you know, or whatever.

979
01:20:04,473 --> 01:20:05,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's amazing.

980
01:20:07,456 --> 01:20:08,556
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually a really good idea.

981
01:20:08,597 --> 01:20:09,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Copyright it real quick.

982
01:20:09,577 --> 01:20:10,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Patent pending.

983
01:20:10,638 --> 01:20:11,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Patent pending.

984
01:20:13,988 --> 01:20:14,528
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what I mean.

985
01:20:14,829 --> 01:20:15,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to hand it to this guy.

986
01:20:15,969 --> 01:20:19,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean thinking to put the Kinect in glasses is a pretty good idea.

987
01:20:19,751 --> 01:20:25,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying we have this very scan society where we scan codes and now it's an iPhone application.

988
01:20:26,215 --> 01:20:27,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't the visor scan those codes?

989
01:20:28,677 --> 01:20:29,497
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be amazing.

990
01:20:32,019 --> 01:20:34,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Kaijudo says name them Kinect specs.

991
01:20:35,618 --> 01:20:36,218
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

992
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:54,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I read this and I go, it's going to help the blind see.

993
01:20:55,022 --> 01:20:56,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And I go, oh, that's a great thing.

994
01:20:56,943 --> 01:20:59,084
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not actually blind.

995
01:20:59,144 --> 01:21:04,488
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to hear from somebody to let me know if this is actually going to be a great thing.

996
01:21:04,508 --> 01:21:15,874
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually also working on retinal patches that are supposed to rework the way the optic nerve takes in the information for cases of people with nerve damage.

997
01:21:16,175 --> 01:21:16,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

998
01:21:17,075 --> 01:21:45,918
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's actually very similar in theory because these are actually relaying it's like they've got these implants that relay information directly into the optic nerve so that people can quote see but it's a lot of the same theory too instead it's just a matter of instead of directing going directly into the nerve it's a matter of providing a projection a display that can be recognizable to people with that level of vision so yeah that makes sense

999
01:21:46,498 --> 01:21:50,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Kai Judo in the chatroom says, 800 Microsoft points if you want to keep seeing past three months.

1000
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:51,780
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wrong.

1001
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:52,801
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just wrong.

1002
01:21:55,522 --> 01:22:00,104
[SPEAKER_05]: They do say that the goal is to bring in the glasses at under 1,000 pounds each.

1003
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:02,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember, this is being researched at Oxford University.

1004
01:22:03,465 --> 01:22:06,266
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, I mean, that sounds really expensive.

1005
01:22:06,386 --> 01:22:10,208
[SPEAKER_05]: But for a piece of technology that you would use...

1006
01:22:11,688 --> 01:22:16,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Everywhere, every day actually does not seem so bad at all and pretty affordable.

1007
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:17,690
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty awesome.

1008
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:23,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Misty in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com says, Hey, pew-pewing QR codes is fun.

1009
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,974
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there is something about those QR codes.

1010
01:22:27,034 --> 01:22:30,495
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all ads for something, but yet she's right.

1011
01:22:30,515 --> 01:22:32,455
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something about scanning those codes.

1012
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:33,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of fun.

1013
01:22:34,016 --> 01:22:44,160
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm just saying why not like really give those codes like a real practical purpose that could actually better society rather than just giving URLs to websites and things like that.

1014
01:22:45,088 --> 01:22:52,813
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually put them up for events with a lot of the stuff that we do now on School for Advertising.

1015
01:22:53,233 --> 01:22:57,696
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually include the QR codes for the charity events for student council stuff.

1016
01:22:58,776 --> 01:23:02,558
[SPEAKER_07]: So they use them a lot in terms of passing along event information.

1017
01:23:02,598 --> 01:23:06,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually find them a lot of times, oddly enough, on Japanese blogs.

1018
01:23:07,381 --> 01:23:07,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1019
01:23:07,961 --> 01:23:08,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1020
01:23:08,281 --> 01:23:09,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

1021
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:12,322
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been having to scan the code things for forever.

1022
01:23:12,622 --> 01:23:15,663
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, mobile phones have always been more advanced over there.

1023
01:23:15,703 --> 01:23:22,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It isn't until we got the iPhone when finally even they started looking at our phones going, hmm, we like that.

1024
01:23:22,325 --> 01:23:24,705
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, for the longest time, they were far more advanced.

1025
01:23:24,865 --> 01:23:27,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the After Years, Final Fantasy IV, the After Years on the Wii?

1026
01:23:27,306 --> 01:23:28,986
[SPEAKER_05]: That was originally a mobile phone game in Japan.

1027
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:35,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, keep in mind, too, is that cellular networks are cheaper than landlines overseas.

1028
01:23:35,288 --> 01:23:35,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1029
01:23:36,269 --> 01:23:41,418
[SPEAKER_07]: So it ended up becoming a much better market to develop as opposed to people here.

1030
01:23:41,538 --> 01:23:43,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I still like my rotary phone.

1031
01:23:45,665 --> 01:23:46,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the noises.

1032
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:48,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like my rotary phone.

1033
01:23:50,607 --> 01:23:56,911
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as good as having to actually call the operator and ask to be put through to Mrs. Cleaver.

1034
01:23:57,011 --> 01:24:07,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, you know, if people go to Geek Life and click the link for ThinkGeek, you can buy a handset for your iPhone.

1035
01:24:08,338 --> 01:24:11,379
[SPEAKER_07]: A rotary phone style handset for your iPhone.

1036
01:24:11,419 --> 01:24:13,319
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also buy bacon mints on ThinkGeek.

1037
01:24:13,639 --> 01:24:14,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you can.

1038
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:15,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

1039
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,480
[SPEAKER_07]: But follow the link.

1040
01:24:18,681 --> 01:24:24,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, but back to... Are we going to get a kickback for that little plug you just said?

1041
01:24:24,562 --> 01:24:24,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1042
01:24:26,022 --> 01:24:26,302
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1043
01:24:26,482 --> 01:24:28,963
[SPEAKER_07]: But back to the point, I mean...

1044
01:24:30,555 --> 01:24:58,159
[SPEAKER_07]: it really has to do also with how far society itself is willing to advance because keep in mind I'm going to use an old comparison here Betamax and VHS if you look at the two side by side Betamax was the better format you had a better picture quality but it went to VHS because of funding because that's what got the push it's that way with any technology it depends on what's got the backing behind it

1045
01:24:58,839 --> 01:25:20,625
[SPEAKER_07]: where you're say that you live in Japan and it's better to have a cell phone service you know then obviously that's where the money is that's where people are going to push the technology but here for the longest time it was all landlines you know cell phones were novel you had that big brick in your car you know but now it's kind of turning around like you know Dan and I don't have a landline

1046
01:25:20,785 --> 01:25:23,226
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I remember my parents' first cell phone.

1047
01:25:23,266 --> 01:25:26,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that fucker mounted in the middle of the car.

1048
01:25:26,328 --> 01:25:28,369
[SPEAKER_05]: It was this giant handset you actually picked up.

1049
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:30,049
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked like it was connected to a car battery.

1050
01:25:30,069 --> 01:25:31,590
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like it caused cancer.

1051
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:40,054
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we went to a trip coming back from Washington one time when Dan's dad had his wedding.

1052
01:25:40,614 --> 01:25:41,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Right soon after I moved out here.

1053
01:25:42,395 --> 01:25:45,397
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're talking about, you know, late 90s.

1054
01:25:46,577 --> 01:25:49,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looked like a phone attached to a car battery.

1055
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:50,839
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1056
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I really do.

1057
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, who's seen Kill Bill?

1058
01:25:54,581 --> 01:25:57,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And the phone that Sophie pops out in the flashback scene?

1059
01:25:58,563 --> 01:26:00,444
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's what cell phones look like.

1060
01:26:00,564 --> 01:26:03,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

1061
01:26:04,786 --> 01:26:10,249
[SPEAKER_07]: But my point is that it really depends on what market the money is going to be in.

1062
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:16,512
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I met a kid the other day, didn't know what a VHS tape was.

1063
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:22,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I think part of it was just trolling.

1064
01:26:36,616 --> 01:26:38,037
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1065
01:27:03,974 --> 01:27:04,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1066
01:27:19,071 --> 01:27:23,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think even I am challenged to sit down, like imagine if I had to sit down and write a letter in cursive.

1067
01:27:24,337 --> 01:27:29,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that would actually like take a minute to kind of like, okay, it'd be like some of the capital letters you don't write every day.

1068
01:27:30,603 --> 01:27:38,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I take a lot of written notes, but I print, you know, but like if I had to write cursive, I don't really practice that.

1069
01:27:38,422 --> 01:27:39,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually do practice my cursive.

1070
01:27:53,826 --> 01:27:55,867
[SPEAKER_07]: She would make me sit down and practice my handwriting.

1071
01:27:56,347 --> 01:27:57,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So to this day.

1072
01:27:57,608 --> 01:28:09,812
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when I went and took typography, and we had to, basically what he had us do is start off with glyphs and then find out once our glyphs got to be a little bit more, just free drawing little glyphs.

1073
01:28:10,253 --> 01:28:13,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And once they got to be more complex, then we said, okay, what letter does that look like?

1074
01:28:13,894 --> 01:28:15,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'd practice full letter forms.

1075
01:28:15,675 --> 01:28:15,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1076
01:28:16,355 --> 01:28:18,116
[SPEAKER_07]: and then pick that and go from there.

1077
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:25,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was talking about how written language evolved just from reflex in your hands.

1078
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:37,084
[SPEAKER_05]: My printed handwriting only got better when I started my job as a corporate trainer because I have to write on the whiteboard all the time and it's actually kind of embarrassing that my handwriting sucks.

1079
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:41,967
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know I'll be writing stuff on the board and I'm like, oh God, it looks like a seven-year-old is teaching this class.

1080
01:28:42,247 --> 01:28:42,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Practice.

1081
01:28:43,587 --> 01:28:47,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, you know, and I've been doing my job long enough now where it's gotten a lot better.

1082
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:53,311
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, that's the whole point is that those handwriting skills aren't being focused on that much anymore.

1083
01:28:53,531 --> 01:28:56,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So people are forgetting what should be a basic skill.

1084
01:28:57,473 --> 01:29:00,194
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a lot of people are actually even forgetting the origins of their language.

1085
01:29:00,214 --> 01:29:06,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I posted something from Crack Today about words showing up in the dictionary, like girl, like the G-R-R-R-L.

1086
01:29:07,077 --> 01:29:07,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, right.

1087
01:29:07,977 --> 01:29:10,098
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, those aren't real words.

1088
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:11,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Those don't need to be there.

1089
01:29:11,259 --> 01:29:11,779
[SPEAKER_07]: That's slang.

1090
01:29:12,779 --> 01:29:22,082
[SPEAKER_05]: The one reason I would want to be an English teacher is to say if you use any text speak in a written paper, you automatically fail this entire class.

1091
01:29:22,162 --> 01:29:24,103
[SPEAKER_07]: My second grade teacher was mean.

1092
01:29:24,483 --> 01:29:31,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not talking about... Okay, she was pregnant and then had her baby, so I think part of it might have been... Now that I'm an adult, it might have been postpartum.

1093
01:29:31,746 --> 01:29:37,388
[SPEAKER_07]: But the first half of the semester, we had the sweetest lady as the substitute, and then the rest of the year is Miss Bitch Game.

1094
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:40,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Her name was Miss... I'm not going to say it.

1095
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:42,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I still remember her name.

1096
01:29:43,571 --> 01:29:48,034
[SPEAKER_07]: But she used to just walk by and smack our hands every time we started doing a letter form wrong.

1097
01:29:48,794 --> 01:29:51,496
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, no, you're going to sit and you're going to start from the beginning and rewrite the whole thing.

1098
01:29:54,298 --> 01:29:58,160
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think people are relying too much on their cell phones also to correct their spelling.

1099
01:29:59,621 --> 01:30:06,165
[SPEAKER_07]: How much more often do you see people doing T-H-E-R-E when they mean a possessive there?

1100
01:30:08,582 --> 01:30:09,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right.

1101
01:30:09,582 --> 01:30:11,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people are relying too much on their autocorrect.

1102
01:30:12,183 --> 01:30:25,446
[SPEAKER_07]: And it goes back to that same thing when I brought up Japan with people forgetting how to write, you know... I was even reading an article the other day about how a lot of the original kanji is actually now brought out in more simplified forms.

1103
01:30:25,886 --> 01:30:27,166
[SPEAKER_07]: And people are forgetting how to write the old way.

1104
01:30:27,947 --> 01:30:28,367
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's...

1105
01:30:30,468 --> 01:30:36,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that having our computers and everything do this for us is making us all lazier as people.

1106
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:43,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And people are forgetting something that should just be something that you learn in first grade.

1107
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:44,590
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, OLR listeners.

1108
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:48,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you think maybe your handwriting can use some improvement, here's a chance.

1109
01:30:48,312 --> 01:30:59,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a pen and paper, which might be a chore all in itself, but find a pen and paper and write down, the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog five times every day.

1110
01:30:59,335 --> 01:31:01,416
[SPEAKER_05]: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

1111
01:31:01,876 --> 01:31:03,116
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you're a design person.

1112
01:31:03,136 --> 01:31:04,897
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why that, why is that sentence important?

1113
01:31:04,957 --> 01:31:07,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it has every word in the alphabet, every letter in the alphabet.

1114
01:31:07,238 --> 01:31:07,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

1115
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:11,471
[SPEAKER_07]: That's also why it's used for typeface samples.

1116
01:31:11,491 --> 01:31:15,312
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a few other sentences that have everyone.

1117
01:31:15,332 --> 01:31:15,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't remember.

1118
01:31:16,033 --> 01:31:16,873
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a few other.

1119
01:31:18,193 --> 01:31:23,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Emma Gray, which is one of the type foundries that I follow, has different sample sheets out.

1120
01:31:23,055 --> 01:31:24,475
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole like lorem ipsum.

1121
01:31:25,076 --> 01:31:25,976
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not the lorem ipsum.

1122
01:31:26,076 --> 01:31:28,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Different sentences that have the same, have the letters in them.

1123
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:33,192
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I'm trying to integrate the geeky design stuff into the show for you.

1124
01:31:33,472 --> 01:31:33,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1125
01:31:33,933 --> 01:31:34,733
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me happy.

1126
01:31:34,994 --> 01:31:36,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm throwing you a bone.

1127
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:40,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a squee, which is why I was showing you someone throwing up rainbows on somebody else.

1128
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:41,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll find the picture for the chat room.

1129
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,160
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1130
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:43,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of throwing up rainbows.

1131
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:47,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some happy music for you.

1132
01:31:47,531 --> 01:31:50,873
[SPEAKER_05]: They can always tell you that the classic game of the week is on its way.

1133
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:57,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week DarkSakura goes to the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks you ungrateful children should be checking out.

1134
01:31:57,536 --> 01:32:00,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you've never had VHS in your life.

1135
01:32:01,458 --> 01:32:03,239
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably have missed a lot of these games.

1136
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a Betamax player.

1137
01:32:04,921 --> 01:32:06,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a Betamax player, too.

1138
01:32:06,121 --> 01:32:07,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Sit down.

1139
01:32:07,582 --> 01:32:08,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I had Clue on Betamax.

1140
01:32:08,983 --> 01:32:09,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Sit down.

1141
01:32:09,484 --> 01:32:15,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I had an 8-track player with a record player attached to it and transistor keys.

1142
01:32:15,047 --> 01:32:16,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold up to the classic game of the week.

1143
01:32:16,488 --> 01:32:24,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the record player that was built into the... Well, my family had the record player that was built into the shelf because the shelf was the speaker.

1144
01:32:24,594 --> 01:32:25,294
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so big.

1145
01:32:25,834 --> 01:32:28,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had Star Wars soundtrack on vinyl.

1146
01:32:28,416 --> 01:32:30,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish I still had that today because that thing's probably worth a shit ton of money.

1147
01:32:31,238 --> 01:32:31,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn the page, bleep!

1148
01:32:55,589 --> 01:32:57,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, well, I had a gramophone.

1149
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to fucking crank that shit if I wanted something to play.

1150
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:03,610
[SPEAKER_07]: My husband's laughing in the other room.

1151
01:33:04,451 --> 01:33:06,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'll tell you one thing that I did have.

1152
01:33:06,271 --> 01:33:10,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I had an entire set of Voltron books on cassette.

1153
01:33:10,792 --> 01:33:13,532
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolfInChat says, I had reel-to-reel biatches.

1154
01:33:13,832 --> 01:33:17,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, when I studied communication design in college, we had to learn.

1155
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:22,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, this is just, this is honestly, should I say this on the radio?

1156
01:33:22,654 --> 01:33:22,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Say it.

1157
01:33:24,281 --> 01:33:24,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1158
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:24,581
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1159
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,402
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1160
01:34:06,633 --> 01:34:22,136
[SPEAKER_05]: with fucking tape and a wax pen where you listen to the thing and then you have to do the wax pen to cut out the words and all this stuff and guess how much I've used a wax tape in producing nine years that lasts longer than most radio shows do on commercial radio.

1161
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:26,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess how many times I've used a wax pen in the nine years of doing this show.

1162
01:34:26,697 --> 01:34:27,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero.

1163
01:34:29,917 --> 01:34:32,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the state school is not on the cutting edge technology.

1164
01:34:35,180 --> 01:35:01,592
[SPEAKER_05]: but you could get drinks really cheap I can say this though the design program at Sac State is actually really top notch and some of the people are hiring directly from Sac State now well I'm sure things have changed and so forth but I'm just saying some people learn best from just being thrown in the pool and told you better fucking swim to me well there's a book I'm reading right now which by the way the review should be on Geek Life in a few days and I know it's ironic that I'm a teacher now but I'm a corporate trainer there's a big difference

1165
01:35:03,292 --> 01:35:09,855
[SPEAKER_07]: But the book I'm reading is an autobiography of a big name in comics, and again, everyone will find out who it is.

1166
01:35:10,195 --> 01:35:18,438
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's talking about how he broke into illustration and comics just by drawing all the time and then being hired because of his talent, because of his skill.

1167
01:35:19,258 --> 01:35:29,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And learning how to do newspaper editing and airbrushing in the 30s by being said, here's your airbrush, these are your inks.

1168
01:35:32,229 --> 01:35:36,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I realize my opinion is a little bit controversial, but I just speak from real life experience.

1169
01:35:36,912 --> 01:35:37,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with you.

1170
01:35:38,673 --> 01:35:48,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize some people out there may not and may even possibly be offended, but I'm just saying from my experience in my world, college did nothing for me, but fuck me up emotionally.

1171
01:35:49,814 --> 01:35:58,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Like with the classes I've gone to, I know how to use the programs already, but I listen to my teachers who have been working in the field because I want their experience.

1172
01:35:58,524 --> 01:36:02,769
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a better thing when you have a teacher that gives you real life experience because they're in it.

1173
01:36:02,789 --> 01:36:03,350
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing it.

1174
01:36:04,051 --> 01:36:07,255
[SPEAKER_07]: As opposed to, oh, I got my master's and now I'm going to teach.

1175
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:09,041
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1176
01:36:09,581 --> 01:36:10,342
[SPEAKER_07]: You can tell the difference.

1177
01:36:11,222 --> 01:36:12,502
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I'm sorry.

1178
01:36:12,822 --> 01:36:13,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

1179
01:36:13,823 --> 01:36:14,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know what else I had?

1180
01:36:14,543 --> 01:36:19,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I had all of the Gremlins records that they gave out at McDonald's with the Happy Meal.

1181
01:36:19,584 --> 01:36:27,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the record that came free in the newspaper that sang the song about the big Mac McDLT, a quarter pounder with some cheese.

1182
01:36:27,867 --> 01:36:29,527
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I remember that song?

1183
01:36:29,728 --> 01:36:31,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that fucking song!

1184
01:36:31,408 --> 01:36:32,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the Fruit Loops one.

1185
01:36:32,109 --> 01:36:33,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a corporate whore.

1186
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:34,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, I had the Fruit Loops one.

1187
01:36:34,811 --> 01:36:38,153
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that came in on a Square album in a box of Fruit Loops.

1188
01:36:38,373 --> 01:36:39,875
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a fucking plastic record.

1189
01:36:39,995 --> 01:36:40,255
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1190
01:36:42,977 --> 01:36:43,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1191
01:36:43,658 --> 01:36:45,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I love how we went from throwing up rainbows.

1192
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:51,003
[SPEAKER_07]: You know you're old school when you've had a warped record and you fixed it yourself.

1193
01:36:53,005 --> 01:36:59,310
[SPEAKER_05]: You know you're old school when you know that the best version of Alice in Wonderland they ever made was that TV movie in the 80s with Carol Channing.

1194
01:36:59,330 --> 01:36:59,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I

1195
01:37:02,168 --> 01:37:03,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to rainbows.

1196
01:37:07,361 --> 01:37:08,661
[SPEAKER_07]: How about some classic games?

1197
01:37:10,042 --> 01:37:14,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Well this, I'm taking us all the way back to 1996.

1198
01:37:15,343 --> 01:37:16,783
[SPEAKER_07]: That was before I moved out here.

1199
01:37:17,243 --> 01:37:22,384
[SPEAKER_07]: And I must thank my husband for turning me on to this series even though I did work for Namco for a little while.

1200
01:37:23,064 --> 01:37:28,185
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't really give it much thought until my husband said, this game's awesome, we're gonna play it.

1201
01:37:28,765 --> 01:37:30,725
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is Soul Edge.

1202
01:37:31,545 --> 01:37:32,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

1203
01:37:32,706 --> 01:37:33,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul Edge.

1204
01:37:34,506 --> 01:37:35,226
[SPEAKER_05]: You got soul.

1205
01:37:36,909 --> 01:37:41,114
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, this is the intro, so we have to play a little bit of the intro.

1206
01:37:44,839 --> 01:37:52,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcending history and the world, a tale of soul and swords, eternally retold.

1207
01:38:04,889 --> 01:38:09,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, this game had... We've actually got this soundtrack.

1208
01:38:09,251 --> 01:38:09,792
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so cool.

1209
01:38:10,112 --> 01:38:14,033
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, this is from the PlayStation version, Soul Blade.

1210
01:38:14,514 --> 01:38:18,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Soul Edge is a 3D fighting game.

1211
01:38:18,515 --> 01:38:23,277
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the second one that had characters with weapons, the first being Toshinden.

1212
01:38:24,158 --> 01:38:30,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And this actually had... You know, everyone had their different style depending on their actual weapon.

1213
01:38:31,741 --> 01:38:31,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1214
01:38:34,045 --> 01:38:35,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Soul Edge Version 2 Soul Edge Version 2

1215
01:38:50,705 --> 01:38:54,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Huang was put into that version as well.

1216
01:38:55,148 --> 01:38:59,031
[SPEAKER_07]: He was actually originally a palette swap of Mitsurugi in the Korean version.

1217
01:38:59,671 --> 01:39:05,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And you could play as Cervantes, who is the pirate who had the soul edge, the sword.

1218
01:39:06,276 --> 01:39:12,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also put in air combos and guard impacts and everyone had upgraded moves.

1219
01:39:12,941 --> 01:39:15,643
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out, like I said, on the PlayStation as Soul Blade.

1220
01:39:16,824 --> 01:39:16,984
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

1221
01:39:19,927 --> 01:39:21,888
[SPEAKER_07]: It was... Oh, you're playing... That's Cervantes' music.

1222
01:39:21,988 --> 01:39:22,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that song.

1223
01:39:22,749 --> 01:39:23,329
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so cool.

1224
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:27,372
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, everyone had their own little... Hold on.

1225
01:39:27,412 --> 01:39:29,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me let the listeners have a peek at this music real quick.

1226
01:39:29,773 --> 01:39:32,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I will say one thing I love... Start from the beginning.

1227
01:39:32,435 --> 01:39:35,157
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I love about these games is the soundtracks.

1228
01:39:35,217 --> 01:39:37,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're just flippin' amazing.

1229
01:39:37,358 --> 01:39:37,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

1230
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:38,159
[SPEAKER_05]: A little clip.

1231
01:39:56,830 --> 01:40:01,013
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yes, that's actually, I think, my favorite piece in that game.

1232
01:40:01,033 --> 01:40:04,075
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the arranged version, by the way, from the PlayStation version.

1233
01:40:04,855 --> 01:40:09,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the PlayStation versions had arranged soundtracks, as well as the original soundtracks.

1234
01:40:10,219 --> 01:40:10,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1235
01:40:13,241 --> 01:40:19,865
[SPEAKER_07]: At any rate, basically, you could move your character all along their little...

1236
01:40:22,506 --> 01:40:28,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Stage area, and you had borders around the stage, so if you fell off of your little stage, then that was, you know, you'd die.

1237
01:40:28,092 --> 01:40:29,654
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hard, though, to jump off the stage.

1238
01:40:31,576 --> 01:40:38,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Your jump was actually kind of, not really so much of a jump, but some characters had better jumps.

1239
01:40:39,644 --> 01:40:44,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there was also a weapon gauge, and it had your weapon's resistance on it.

1240
01:40:46,006 --> 01:40:49,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, when you would block an attack, your bar would deplete.

1241
01:40:49,287 --> 01:40:51,808
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it emptied, you would lose your weapon.

1242
01:40:52,729 --> 01:40:54,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you'd have to finish the match unarmed.

1243
01:40:55,389 --> 01:40:57,730
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, basically, like, oops, my sword broke.

1244
01:40:57,990 --> 01:40:58,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, crap.

1245
01:40:59,491 --> 01:40:59,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh...

1246
01:41:01,678 --> 01:41:08,703
[SPEAKER_07]: There were also locking moves too, so you'd have to press the button at the right time and see who could get out of it.

1247
01:41:10,044 --> 01:41:15,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone had one or two unblockable attacks, which actually came from the Tekken series.

1248
01:41:16,248 --> 01:41:20,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really hard to pull them off, so that kept it pretty balanced.

1249
01:41:20,691 --> 01:41:26,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you had critical edge attacks that were like a long series of different links.

1250
01:41:26,895 --> 01:41:30,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like, have you ever played in Tekken when you used King's Throws?

1251
01:41:30,137 --> 01:41:30,938
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of the same deal.

1252
01:41:32,038 --> 01:41:40,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but then, um, there were different combinations of different attacks that would, you know, have a special sequence.

1253
01:41:41,225 --> 01:41:45,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, on top of that, it would also deplete a third of the weapons gauge when you use it.

1254
01:41:45,508 --> 01:41:46,889
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the ABK attacks.

1255
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:54,295
[SPEAKER_07]: It had an aggressive block, which is called Guard Impact, that would, uh, give you a free counterattack.

1256
01:41:55,015 --> 01:41:57,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you also had, like I said earlier, a ring out.

1257
01:41:57,918 --> 01:42:00,279
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just jump out of the ring, you have to be thrown out of the ring.

1258
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:12,104
[SPEAKER_07]: The game itself, according to Namco, took place in 1584, and it's warriors searching for the Soul Edge.

1259
01:42:12,404 --> 01:42:15,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It had different names, but it was pretty nasty.

1260
01:42:16,065 --> 01:42:18,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Anytime someone had it, bad crap happened.

1261
01:42:19,146 --> 01:42:21,607
[SPEAKER_07]: So it had all kinds of different characters.

1262
01:42:21,627 --> 01:42:25,168
[SPEAKER_07]: You had Siegfried, you had Mitsurugi, who was your samurai.

1263
01:42:25,188 --> 01:42:26,869
[SPEAKER_07]: You had Taki, who was your ninja girl.

1264
01:42:27,569 --> 01:42:28,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Voldo!

1265
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:29,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Voldo.

1266
01:42:30,092 --> 01:42:31,534
[SPEAKER_07]: He was Mr. Bondage Boy.

1267
01:42:33,296 --> 01:42:37,882
[SPEAKER_07]: His weapon was a katar, the hand-mounted blade.

1268
01:42:38,843 --> 01:42:43,209
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wore lots of strappy leather, I'm sure some of us recall.

1269
01:42:44,991 --> 01:42:45,912
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was...

1270
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:50,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Song Mina, Seung Ha Myung

1271
01:43:05,674 --> 01:43:13,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And it kept all the Soul Edge version 2 and 5 unlockable characters, including the Soul Edge, the boss of the game.

1272
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:19,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had Arcade Mode, Versus Mode, Survival, Team Battle, Time Attack, and Training.

1273
01:43:19,367 --> 01:43:25,172
[SPEAKER_07]: It had an RPG mode called Edge Master Mode, so you could basically go through a story.

1274
01:43:25,192 --> 01:43:28,175
[SPEAKER_07]: It had it like they were a character in a book, so it was kind of neat.

1275
01:43:29,155 --> 01:43:53,186
[SPEAKER_07]: and you had extra versions of different weapons that had more power or more strength or durability and like I said also you had an arranged soundtrack and the arcade soundtrack and then you had the con super session which that's the album that we have is the con super session that is this band their stuff is really really good stuff

1276
01:43:55,715 --> 01:44:01,583
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is probably one of the best fighting games ever, I think.

1277
01:44:02,085 --> 01:44:03,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people have a lot of love for this game.

1278
01:44:04,487 --> 01:44:13,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Admittedly, I didn't get into this series until Soul Calibur 2, the arcade version, which still is one of my favorite GameCube games they ever made.

1279
01:44:13,813 --> 01:44:17,195
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually from this intro that we're listening to music off of.

1280
01:44:17,215 --> 01:44:18,456
[SPEAKER_07]: It's off the Japanese intro.

1281
01:44:19,317 --> 01:44:22,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they had to put clothes on Sofatia.

1282
01:44:23,719 --> 01:44:27,662
[SPEAKER_07]: In the scene where she's in the water and Hephaestus is coming out of the water to talk to her.

1283
01:44:28,062 --> 01:44:29,543
[SPEAKER_07]: She's naked in the Japanese version.

1284
01:44:29,563 --> 01:44:31,345
[SPEAKER_07]: They had to put clothes on her in the American one.

1285
01:44:32,285 --> 01:44:33,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1286
01:44:53,891 --> 01:44:56,012
[SPEAKER_05]: including some rapid fire news when we get back.

1287
01:44:56,052 --> 01:44:56,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter topics.

1288
01:44:57,252 --> 01:44:58,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your tweets in.

1289
01:44:58,093 --> 01:44:59,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1290
01:44:59,553 --> 01:45:02,775
[SPEAKER_05]: You get about five more minutes to get those in if you're listening live on Sunday nights.

1291
01:45:03,355 --> 01:45:05,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And some more news stories and of course your calls.

1292
01:45:05,796 --> 01:45:08,337
[SPEAKER_05]: When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radios.

1293
01:45:08,357 --> 01:45:08,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go anywhere.

1294
01:45:09,298 --> 01:45:10,058
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back after this.

1295
01:45:16,411 --> 01:45:18,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1296
01:45:18,992 --> 01:45:28,076
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live here on this July 10th, 2011 with episode number 419 of our show, which you know means next week is episode 420.

1297
01:45:28,537 --> 01:45:30,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that, you know, any of us are...

1298
01:45:31,678 --> 01:45:32,958
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1299
01:46:00,988 --> 01:46:05,275
[SPEAKER_05]: and Understation Live, the show where I started on internet radio.

1300
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:07,380
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1301
01:46:32,677 --> 01:46:39,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And it occurred to me, I don't know if you saw my reply to a post on our private guilds forums, but that night I was so mad.

1302
01:46:40,463 --> 01:46:45,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you said something to me, DarkSakura, and I was like, this game can suck my fucking dick, good night.

1303
01:46:45,307 --> 01:46:47,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, it didn't occur to me until like two days later.

1304
01:46:47,869 --> 01:46:50,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh God, did she think I said that to her?

1305
01:46:50,491 --> 01:46:51,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I wasn't saying that to her.

1306
01:46:52,132 --> 01:46:56,656
[SPEAKER_07]: You said some acronym that I didn't understand at the time.

1307
01:46:57,376 --> 01:47:01,119
[SPEAKER_07]: And then afterwards I was like, oh, that's what it is.

1308
01:47:01,239 --> 01:47:03,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you said VTK'd.

1309
01:47:04,441 --> 01:47:06,803
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like... Oh, vote kicked.

1310
01:47:06,843 --> 01:47:07,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1311
01:47:07,424 --> 01:47:07,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Vote kicked.

1312
01:47:07,924 --> 01:47:09,165
[SPEAKER_05]: They VTK'd me.

1313
01:47:09,185 --> 01:47:09,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, VTK'd me.

1314
01:47:09,905 --> 01:47:10,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1315
01:47:10,506 --> 01:47:14,209
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was like... My reply I remember was, what?

1316
01:47:14,389 --> 01:47:15,650
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, this game can suck my dick.

1317
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:16,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going, bye.

1318
01:47:17,311 --> 01:47:20,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sitting there just staring at my computer going...

1319
01:47:22,065 --> 01:47:23,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's gonna play with me now?

1320
01:47:24,647 --> 01:47:27,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a diva moment where I stormed off the set.

1321
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:29,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, that's exactly what it was like.

1322
01:47:30,112 --> 01:47:32,234
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like, I seriously, I sat there for 10 minutes.

1323
01:47:32,334 --> 01:47:36,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I had time for my character to go on away and sit down and pout.

1324
01:47:37,979 --> 01:47:40,501
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, I was like, I was trying to figure out what's going on.

1325
01:47:40,541 --> 01:47:41,662
[SPEAKER_07]: So I started looking it up online.

1326
01:47:42,223 --> 01:47:46,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I was emotionally raped by a guild on another server with that vote.

1327
01:47:46,747 --> 01:47:48,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Do the troll dungeons link to other servers?

1328
01:47:49,614 --> 01:47:50,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, they all do.

1329
01:47:50,574 --> 01:47:51,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know about that.

1330
01:47:51,595 --> 01:47:52,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, they all do.

1331
01:47:53,615 --> 01:47:54,376
[SPEAKER_05]: So be careful.

1332
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:55,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Loki, you were going to ask a question.

1333
01:47:56,036 --> 01:48:11,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, I was just going to say, speaking of voting the kick up, prior to the mods being patched on the Grand Theft Auto, when we were playing just regular private matches, my coworkers would usually try to vote to kick me out of the game because I'd be kicking the crap out of them.

1334
01:48:12,201 --> 01:48:14,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, vote him out, he's being...

1335
01:48:16,028 --> 01:48:18,930
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ignorant that somebody would vote kick just because they're good.

1336
01:48:20,952 --> 01:48:21,753
[SPEAKER_04]: They think it's funny.

1337
01:48:21,793 --> 01:48:26,458
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I keep telling myself is that this guild couldn't just handle my beauty so that's why they had to vote kick me.

1338
01:48:26,738 --> 01:48:31,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, more information on that at HordeHouse.com We told you about the stupid bitch we had.

1339
01:48:32,742 --> 01:48:33,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1340
01:48:54,384 --> 01:48:55,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to run through this really fast.

1341
01:48:55,524 --> 01:48:56,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care about anybody else.

1342
01:48:56,465 --> 01:48:57,366
[SPEAKER_07]: We can only do the last one.

1343
01:48:57,446 --> 01:48:59,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she starts getting really foul.

1344
01:48:59,467 --> 01:49:03,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she's like saying, let's vote to kick the tank.

1345
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:04,831
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, bitch, no.

1346
01:49:04,851 --> 01:49:09,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, do you read that all of us are in the same guild and you're not?

1347
01:49:11,335 --> 01:49:13,057
[SPEAKER_05]: See, you should have vote kicked her.

1348
01:49:13,437 --> 01:49:13,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I started.

1349
01:49:13,977 --> 01:49:14,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

1350
01:49:14,698 --> 01:49:16,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I requested a vote kicker three times.

1351
01:49:17,109 --> 01:49:17,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And it didn't pass.

1352
01:49:18,371 --> 01:49:19,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It did on the third time.

1353
01:49:20,373 --> 01:49:21,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it did that delay thing.

1354
01:49:22,795 --> 01:49:24,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not a rude cunt.

1355
01:49:24,537 --> 01:49:26,339
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're nice.

1356
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got screen capture.

1357
01:49:28,561 --> 01:49:29,161
[SPEAKER_07]: She was that bad.

1358
01:49:31,564 --> 01:49:33,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to tell you something, everybody.

1359
01:49:33,145 --> 01:49:36,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't matter if you're on World of Warcraft or whatever MMO that you're on.

1360
01:49:37,129 --> 01:49:38,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Be nice.

1361
01:49:39,091 --> 01:49:45,836
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't get anything from being a bitch or, you know, blaming everything on the tank.

1362
01:49:45,916 --> 01:49:46,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a troll.

1363
01:49:47,037 --> 01:49:53,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's so many, so many trolls in WoW, and it's really like, what do you really get?

1364
01:49:53,622 --> 01:49:55,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, this is masturbation for you.

1365
01:49:55,704 --> 01:50:01,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't think of anything else that, like, trolling accomplishes other than, like, jacking yourself off.

1366
01:50:01,248 --> 01:50:02,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm going to give a few pieces of advice.

1367
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:03,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

1368
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:04,271
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1369
01:50:14,892 --> 01:50:18,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's rule number one of the OL Army, which I know we don't talk about that a lot.

1370
01:50:18,773 --> 01:50:20,374
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we do have a Steam group.

1371
01:50:20,714 --> 01:50:23,395
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have several gaming groups available online.

1372
01:50:23,455 --> 01:50:29,356
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, with all the Steam sale orgy stuff going on right now, if you're not in the OL Army group, I don't know what you're doing.

1373
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:32,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the rule number one of the OL Army is don't be a dick.

1374
01:50:33,418 --> 01:50:35,258
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, you should come join us on Steam.

1375
01:50:35,298 --> 01:50:38,579
[SPEAKER_05]: And more information is at OrangeLingerie.com in that little extend play box on the left side.

1376
01:50:39,079 --> 01:50:41,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, number two refers to how you treat your tank.

1377
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:44,441
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a three strike rule.

1378
01:50:45,161 --> 01:50:53,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, if your tank doesn't flat out say, I've never tanked this before and they're doing a bad job, stop and explain the mechanic to them if you happen to know it.

1379
01:50:54,606 --> 01:51:00,749
[SPEAKER_07]: If they still act shitty, give them one more try and if they are just derpy, say, sorry, we need you to leave.

1380
01:51:01,109 --> 01:51:03,710
[SPEAKER_05]: That really doesn't just apply to tanks.

1381
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:06,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that can go for anybody in any MMO.

1382
01:51:06,352 --> 01:51:07,032
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't even have to be WoW.

1383
01:51:07,092 --> 01:51:07,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean,

1384
01:51:07,432 --> 01:51:08,493
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes people make mistakes.

1385
01:51:08,513 --> 01:51:11,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I've started using, you know, when you hit V and the little life bar show up.

1386
01:51:12,315 --> 01:51:20,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I accidentally targeted a creature in a group over because the little name tag was, like, right next to the one I was targeting.

1387
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:24,862
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I made a boo-boo, but I, you know, went and resheaped everybody and everyone was happy.

1388
01:51:25,663 --> 01:51:26,863
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just like...

1389
01:51:28,567 --> 01:51:29,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't point fingers.

1390
01:51:30,388 --> 01:51:31,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't lay blame.

1391
01:51:31,169 --> 01:51:35,051
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone is truly bad, a good party will hold them through it.

1392
01:51:35,172 --> 01:51:40,355
[SPEAKER_07]: If they are being bad on purpose, then say, sorry, you need to practice this one a little bit more.

1393
01:51:40,415 --> 01:51:42,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Play with your guildies for a bit.

1394
01:51:44,398 --> 01:51:46,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not be in a party unless there's one other guildie with me.

1395
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:47,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I just won't do it.

1396
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:53,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I did it once, though, on my first troll heroic.

1397
01:51:53,564 --> 01:51:54,124
[SPEAKER_07]: My third rule.

1398
01:51:54,745 --> 01:51:58,187
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are not on your game, you need to step back.

1399
01:51:59,288 --> 01:51:59,888
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1400
01:52:20,279 --> 01:52:34,255
[SPEAKER_07]: or if I'm having a bad night I'll say you know what I'm just not into this I'm going to have to back out because I'm holding everyone back you need to be able to say to take enough responsibility on yourself that you're not going to ruin somebody else's good time so those are

1401
01:52:35,436 --> 01:53:02,749
[SPEAKER_05]: My three rules for playing with other people Words of sage wisdom from an OMG real life girl Yes Alright Speaking of MMOs I can't remember if I told this story last week So stop me if I'm repeating myself I'm getting old and I forget an old age But Salacious Pop did a really big troll on me Because of the Steam sale that's going on I was mentioning just offhand something about I wonder what Final Fantasy XI is like these days And you know, gosh I'd be really curious what's going on in XI these days

1402
01:53:03,249 --> 01:53:04,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So I open up Steam.

1403
01:53:05,012 --> 01:53:11,761
[SPEAKER_05]: You have been gifted a copy of Final Fantasy XI, the complete Uber edition, including the new Abyssia expansion.

1404
01:53:13,003 --> 01:53:14,145
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 11 bucks.

1405
01:53:14,325 --> 01:53:17,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I look over at Alan and I go, you're such a fucking troll.

1406
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:22,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is actually downloading at home right now.

1407
01:53:22,522 --> 01:53:25,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I'm going to log in and play right away, but yeah.

1408
01:53:25,844 --> 01:53:28,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have 30 days of that that I can check out at some point.

1409
01:53:28,366 --> 01:53:29,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, mine finally finished.

1410
01:53:29,487 --> 01:53:30,868
[SPEAKER_07]: I downloaded Champions.

1411
01:53:31,128 --> 01:53:32,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was like, did you download XI?

1412
01:53:32,589 --> 01:53:32,909
[SPEAKER_05]: No way.

1413
01:53:32,969 --> 01:53:34,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you downloaded Champions, the free, yeah.

1414
01:53:34,871 --> 01:53:35,131
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1415
01:53:36,492 --> 01:53:40,054
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone gave me $11 so I could get Final Fantasy XI, Rob, I would play with you.

1416
01:53:41,495 --> 01:53:43,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to see how lulzy it is now.

1417
01:53:43,076 --> 01:53:43,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1418
01:53:45,083 --> 01:53:45,924
[SPEAKER_05]: But somebody has to give you $11.

1419
01:53:46,704 --> 01:53:47,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck on that.

1420
01:53:47,384 --> 01:53:48,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just send it to me on Steam.

1421
01:53:49,886 --> 01:53:50,886
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so easy now.

1422
01:53:51,767 --> 01:53:52,067
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1423
01:53:53,688 --> 01:53:55,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's in the other room saying, no more momos.

1424
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:57,310
[SPEAKER_05]: No more momos.

1425
01:53:57,350 --> 01:53:58,971
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's only 30 days, Dan.

1426
01:54:01,277 --> 01:54:04,179
[SPEAKER_05]: That's... He's yelling.

1427
01:54:04,199 --> 01:54:05,920
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how Warcraft started.

1428
01:54:06,101 --> 01:54:07,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, fucking Rob.

1429
01:54:07,201 --> 01:54:08,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, I know.

1430
01:54:09,103 --> 01:54:10,364
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

1431
01:54:10,904 --> 01:54:17,109
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do some rapid-fire news and talk about some other stuff going on in the gaming world.

1432
01:54:17,829 --> 01:54:18,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1433
01:54:18,610 --> 01:54:25,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, speaking of Final Fantasy, there's a Final Fantasy game coming to the 3DS, although this may not be the Final Fantasy game you're looking for.

1434
01:54:26,355 --> 01:54:27,696
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Final Fantasy...

1435
01:54:30,325 --> 01:54:31,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Cloud can dance like never before.

1436
01:54:55,630 --> 01:55:00,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny that you should mention Cloud because actually I think I see someone in that picture that looks very similar to a TV Cloud.

1437
01:55:00,594 --> 01:55:07,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just imagining Busta Moves songs in my head with the characters replaced with Cloud and it's really funny to me.

1438
01:55:07,539 --> 01:55:08,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

1439
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:09,520
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks kind of neat.

1440
01:55:09,841 --> 01:55:10,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I like rhythm games.

1441
01:55:10,621 --> 01:55:13,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Final Fantasy so maybe I'd check it out.

1442
01:55:13,743 --> 01:55:20,048
[SPEAKER_04]: For people looking for a Final Fantasy RPG that's brand new and everything, not quite what you're looking for here.

1443
01:55:21,129 --> 01:55:21,929
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd check it out.

1444
01:55:21,949 --> 01:55:22,550
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks kind of neat.

1445
01:55:23,570 --> 01:55:25,431
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like two fanboy worlds colliding.

1446
01:55:26,172 --> 01:55:26,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much, yeah.

1447
01:55:27,372 --> 01:55:34,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, on top of that, Harmonix is, of course, working on a new IP called VidRhythm, and that's literally all we know about that.

1448
01:55:36,157 --> 01:55:41,600
[SPEAKER_04]: They've just confirmed, yeah, there's something that we can add to it at this time, but yes, we are working on that project.

1449
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:44,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe a new Rez-type game or something like that.

1450
01:55:45,962 --> 01:55:46,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, Kenny.

1451
01:55:46,823 --> 01:55:47,043
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1452
01:55:48,123 --> 01:56:12,038
[SPEAKER_04]: and then finally this is kind of neat Rockstar is trademarked Rockstar Films and apparently people are thinking hey you know what they did mention one time that if someone was going to make Grand Theft Auto into a movie that it would be them they said that they would be the ones that would want to handle that

1453
01:56:13,839 --> 01:56:16,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we'll see some movies coming from them.

1454
01:56:16,301 --> 01:56:18,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I could see something like L.A.

1455
01:56:19,243 --> 01:56:24,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire or something like that as a movie from them because it's a little bit more of a linear story.

1456
01:56:25,246 --> 01:56:27,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto would be a little bit kind of crazy.

1457
01:56:27,208 --> 01:56:33,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they could do that, but neat that they'd be turning some of their games into movies.

1458
01:56:34,933 --> 01:56:35,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Neat!

1459
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:40,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Which would you rather have first, a Grand Theft Auto movie or a Red Dead Redemption movie?

1460
01:56:40,863 --> 01:56:43,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I would think Red Dead Redemption would make a better movie.

1461
01:56:43,485 --> 01:56:44,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's just me.

1462
01:56:45,107 --> 01:56:45,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

1463
01:56:46,568 --> 01:56:54,454
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I never realized you have a thing, because usually I beat you here to the show, so I don't see your car pull up a whole lot, but tonight I was late thanks to an accident.

1464
01:56:54,854 --> 01:57:00,158
[SPEAKER_05]: So I pull up behind you, and I never realized you had a license plate frame that said, I'd rather be playing Grand Theft Auto.

1465
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:02,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I got that a few months back.

1466
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:03,301
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nice.

1467
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,621
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, some other quick news here.

1468
01:57:07,101 --> 01:57:11,022
[SPEAKER_05]: An interesting spinoff of the Burnout series that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

1469
01:57:11,422 --> 01:57:13,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Burnout Crash, apparently, is coming out.

1470
01:57:13,943 --> 01:57:15,444
[SPEAKER_05]: By interesting, you mean terrible.

1471
01:57:16,664 --> 01:57:20,225
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing that's interesting about it to me is it's that whole top-down look.

1472
01:57:20,605 --> 01:57:22,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like... Remember...

1473
01:57:24,213 --> 01:57:26,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Ivan, Iron Man, Stewart, Super Offroad

1474
01:57:43,726 --> 01:57:48,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Now granted, I didn't look at the trailer, so let me look at the trailer, because maybe it is kind of poopy if I see it in motion.

1475
01:57:49,748 --> 01:57:51,688
[SPEAKER_04]: They have two different trailers.

1476
01:57:53,449 --> 01:57:55,350
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I do not like the look of freshly colored hair.

1477
01:57:55,390 --> 01:57:56,050
[SPEAKER_04]: You shut your mouth.

1478
01:57:56,590 --> 01:58:01,512
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's the thing about Joystick, is they always have commercials for hair products for women.

1479
01:58:02,272 --> 01:58:04,352
[SPEAKER_04]: That is such a wrong demographic.

1480
01:58:04,412 --> 01:58:07,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait until I see a douche commercial come up on one of these trailers.

1481
01:58:07,954 --> 01:58:09,194
[SPEAKER_04]: That and like, you know, hey...

1482
01:58:09,654 --> 01:58:16,640
[SPEAKER_04]: your children are visiting the internet you should use AOL's blah blah blah to lock down the internet do you have rampant vaginitis?

1483
01:58:18,962 --> 01:58:33,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this trailer is going to show gameplay because they had a teaser one that didn't have any gameplay in it but the gameplay trailer or little preview not good let me do the YouTube thing instead of trying to go to a gaming news website I'll just go direct to YouTube

1484
01:58:35,425 --> 01:58:52,872
[SPEAKER_04]: um but anyways if crash time it's basically you know the crash mode that they had in the other games which hey you know what if they wanted to bring that over into its own game and make it look like the regular burnout games but just be all the crash mode i'd be fine with that so

1485
01:58:55,387 --> 01:58:56,889
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an Xbox Live arcade game, right?

1486
01:58:57,389 --> 01:58:58,190
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fun!

1487
01:58:58,430 --> 01:58:59,512
[SPEAKER_04]: It also supports Kinect.

1488
01:58:59,672 --> 01:59:02,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Notice the hopping up and down icon right there.

1489
01:59:02,615 --> 01:59:05,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, in order to make cars explode, you have to hop up and down.

1490
01:59:05,758 --> 01:59:07,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I can turn that bullshit off, right?

1491
01:59:08,021 --> 01:59:08,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fuck it.

1492
01:59:08,782 --> 01:59:09,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't play with that on.

1493
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:11,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Blow up the pizza truck.

1494
01:59:11,505 --> 01:59:14,528
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks like Super Sprint mixed with Burnout.

1495
01:59:14,648 --> 01:59:16,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is actually kind of rad looking.

1496
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:21,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, there's not a lot going on right now.

1497
01:59:21,870 --> 01:59:24,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it would be better if they were actually driving faster or something.

1498
01:59:24,931 --> 01:59:25,611
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got fire.

1499
01:59:25,871 --> 01:59:27,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of just causing a 20-car pileup.

1500
01:59:27,791 --> 01:59:28,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the point.

1501
01:59:28,751 --> 01:59:35,073
[SPEAKER_04]: See, the car pileups or whatever and destruction, it causes your little meter to build up and then you can explode your car.

1502
01:59:35,213 --> 01:59:38,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's like, there was a mode like that in one of the older Burnout games.

1503
01:59:38,213 --> 01:59:39,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, crash mode.

1504
01:59:39,313 --> 01:59:40,914
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what this is based off of.

1505
01:59:41,274 --> 01:59:45,174
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the thing, though, is I really wish it was in that format and not necessarily this.

1506
01:59:45,534 --> 01:59:49,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Kinect functionality, they have it where you drive the car, like you make

1507
01:59:49,715 --> 01:59:53,898
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 and 2, Steering Wheel Motions or whatever, and then you have the hop up and down to make your car slow.

1508
01:59:53,918 --> 01:59:54,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I hate.

1509
01:59:54,618 --> 01:59:55,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I played that racing game.

1510
01:59:56,679 --> 01:59:57,299
[SPEAKER_05]: It's terrible.

1511
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:57,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1512
01:59:58,260 --> 01:59:58,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't like it.

1513
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:05,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, one game I do like is Torchlight, and Runic Games announced that Torchlight surpassed a million units sold.

1514
02:00:05,584 --> 02:00:07,325
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be across the PC, the Mac, and the 360.

1515
02:00:07,385 --> 02:00:14,229
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't said how much on what system, but considering it's been discounted on Steam several times, I'm pretty sure that helped.

1516
02:00:14,669 --> 02:00:18,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like it helped sell Lady Gaga a million albums when Amazon sold it for 99 cents.

1517
02:00:19,011 --> 02:00:23,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, Runic is right now working on Torchlight 2.

1518
02:00:24,172 --> 02:00:31,454
[SPEAKER_05]: They are still targeting 2011 for the launch, but they won't announce a release date until Runic is closer to being done.

1519
02:00:31,974 --> 02:00:39,716
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell that the employees were from Blizzard, a big chunk of them, because Blizzard does that same damn thing where it's like, it will come out when it's ready.

1520
02:00:41,069 --> 02:01:02,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Kojima, Hideo Kojima, of course, known for the Metal Gear series, but also known for a series that was popular in Japan, Snatcher, which kind of has a cult following here, announced on the latest edition of his Hideo Radio podcast, apparently he is going back to something he had announced several years ago, but nothing ever came of it.

1521
02:01:02,387 --> 02:01:07,651
[SPEAKER_05]: He's basically re-announced that a radio drama inspired by the 1998 cyberpunk game Snatcher

1522
02:01:09,833 --> 02:01:13,755
[SPEAKER_05]: that's been scripted by Suda51 called S.D.

1523
02:01:13,895 --> 02:01:14,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Atcher.

1524
02:01:14,736 --> 02:01:17,337
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a spin on Suda51's name.

1525
02:01:18,077 --> 02:01:20,899
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Team Up Project S thing.

1526
02:01:21,459 --> 02:01:22,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a radio drama.

1527
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:30,423
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be released to coincide with the 300th episode of Hiday Radio, and Akira Yamaoka is going to be doing the music.

1528
02:01:30,904 --> 02:01:36,166
[SPEAKER_05]: So judging by the fact that they're on episode 296 now, you'll be able to find this episode 300.

1529
02:01:36,206 --> 02:01:39,348
[SPEAKER_05]: They come out biweekly, so 300 will be in about, what,

1530
02:01:39,827 --> 02:01:40,187
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

1531
02:01:51,724 --> 02:01:57,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in other news, we do have some costumes for LittleBigPlanet 2, the Final Fantasy 7 pack.

1532
02:01:58,749 --> 02:02:07,556
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be, from what I can see on here, we have Aerith, who cares, Tifa, we have Vincent, yay, Cloud, and Sephiroth.

1533
02:02:07,636 --> 02:02:10,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you have Aerith, you can just jump her off a cliff over and over.

1534
02:02:10,638 --> 02:02:13,360
[SPEAKER_07]: No, if you've got Aerith, you just have to stab her over and over.

1535
02:02:13,561 --> 02:02:15,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just hold the square and watch her head explode.

1536
02:02:15,762 --> 02:02:19,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember, in LittleBigPlanet 2, you can explode your little guy.

1537
02:02:19,305 --> 02:02:19,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1538
02:02:19,835 --> 02:02:22,257
[SPEAKER_07]: That, okay, that makes it worth it.

1539
02:02:22,717 --> 02:02:24,719
[SPEAKER_07]: The Sephiroth one's kind of funny looking for the record.

1540
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:32,845
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, now I actually saw the trailer for this in the theater for Tekken Blood Vengeance.

1541
02:02:34,006 --> 02:02:36,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, this looks really cool, I'm gonna see that.

1542
02:02:38,590 --> 02:02:40,853
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a one-night-only U.S.

1543
02:02:40,913 --> 02:02:44,516
[SPEAKER_07]: showing that's going to be before the Japanese release by a little over a month.

1544
02:02:45,497 --> 02:02:54,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has 20 minutes of interviews with the tech and staff, including the screenwriter Dai Sato.

1545
02:02:54,046 --> 02:02:55,528
[SPEAKER_07]: He also was behind Cowboy Bebop.

1546
02:02:55,848 --> 02:03:01,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this going to be one of those horrible live events at the theater things that you always see the commercials for?

1547
02:03:01,431 --> 02:03:07,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the whole, like, see Coldplay take the stage at Madison Square Garden at your local theater.

1548
02:03:07,375 --> 02:03:09,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It is like one of those.

1549
02:03:10,097 --> 02:03:10,257
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1550
02:03:10,797 --> 02:03:11,758
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to see the movie.

1551
02:03:12,418 --> 02:03:16,120
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I know, I know, but don't you ever see the commercials of the movies for these things?

1552
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:16,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

1553
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:18,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, those are Fathom Events things.

1554
02:03:18,581 --> 02:03:19,582
[SPEAKER_05]: That, Fathom Events.

1555
02:03:19,662 --> 02:03:21,843
[SPEAKER_05]: A night at the Metropolitan.

1556
02:03:21,863 --> 02:03:27,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are going to be doing, it is the same thing, because they do this, it's very limited theaters that they do it in.

1557
02:03:28,666 --> 02:03:35,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they've done other anime things, like they did the Death Note movie, and the live action Death Note movie, and stuff like that.

1558
02:03:36,330 --> 02:03:37,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, we went to see Escaflowne.

1559
02:03:38,621 --> 02:04:03,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't go to that I thought you went with us to see Ascophonians I know, I remember a bunch of people went to that San Francisco Nope, never seen it They'll probably do this with the Trigon movie when it comes out I've seen a bunch of movies I saw Perfect Blue in the theater You went to see Perfect Blue with me, that was it No, I haven't seen that either I don't think, there's not a lot of animes I've seen in the theater I saw Howl's Moving Castle You've seen Requiem for a Dream, haven't you?

1560
02:04:03,986 --> 02:04:04,066
[SPEAKER_05]: No

1561
02:04:05,164 --> 02:04:06,604
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like Salacious Pop's favorite movie.

1562
02:04:06,925 --> 02:04:10,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but the guy was a fan of the director of Perfect Blue.

1563
02:04:13,346 --> 02:04:14,687
[SPEAKER_07]: He actually fully ripped a scene from it.

1564
02:04:14,987 --> 02:04:20,568
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, there's totally a new Studio Ghibli film coming out in a couple weeks in Japan.

1565
02:04:20,588 --> 02:04:21,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea.

1566
02:04:21,728 --> 02:04:25,049
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually one that just came out already out there, but I want to come out here really desperately.

1567
02:04:25,569 --> 02:04:31,771
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Kurigurashi no Ariete, which is the borrower Ariete from the books The Borrowers.

1568
02:04:32,759 --> 02:04:33,600
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1569
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:52,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to see the movie.

1570
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:53,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to see the movie.

1571
02:04:53,881 --> 02:04:55,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I am a huge Tekken fangirl.

1572
02:04:55,681 --> 02:04:56,362
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's all CG.

1573
02:04:57,262 --> 02:04:58,302
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be really cool.

1574
02:04:58,722 --> 02:05:00,363
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to be on July 26th.

1575
02:05:01,343 --> 02:05:06,965
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it will be six hours of gorgeous Tekken gooey mess.

1576
02:05:07,105 --> 02:05:07,505
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1577
02:05:07,545 --> 02:05:14,927
[SPEAKER_05]: For OLR's 10th anniversary show, I think we should hook up with Fathom Events and make it a one night in the theater special.

1578
02:05:15,127 --> 02:05:18,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And DarkSakura will just have to deal with being on the big screen for a night.

1579
02:05:18,308 --> 02:05:21,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how expensive that is, but I know that they do that for Riff Trax.

1580
02:05:21,788 --> 02:05:23,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they?

1581
02:05:24,009 --> 02:05:26,710
[SPEAKER_04]: It's expensive, but I think it's moderately expensive.

1582
02:05:26,770 --> 02:05:33,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, OLR Army, call your local theater and demand the OLR 10th anniversary special to come to Fathom Events.

1583
02:05:33,931 --> 02:05:35,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have a mask made.

1584
02:05:35,532 --> 02:05:36,532
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be weird.

1585
02:05:38,234 --> 02:05:38,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1586
02:05:39,735 --> 02:05:41,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're packing theaters, all right.

1587
02:05:42,156 --> 02:05:54,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now that we've sat you down and you've paid $10 to come see our big mugs in your local movie theater, we thought, what should we do that's special for this 10th year anniversary show?

1588
02:05:54,402 --> 02:05:55,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Barrett Vision 3D.

1589
02:05:55,762 --> 02:06:01,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to have Extifer bleach his asshole live right in front of you on the camera.

1590
02:06:01,165 --> 02:06:02,346
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have an X rating.

1591
02:06:03,246 --> 02:06:05,730
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be rated X for extifers, bitched asshole.

1592
02:06:05,750 --> 02:06:09,134
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be like the time that Katie Couric got her colonoscopy on the Today Show.

1593
02:06:09,194 --> 02:06:09,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

1594
02:06:10,907 --> 02:06:17,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, in other news, Resident Evil HD versions are going to be coming out on Xbox.

1595
02:06:17,351 --> 02:06:18,171
[SPEAKER_07]: On Xbox 360.

1596
02:06:18,672 --> 02:06:21,913
[SPEAKER_07]: We will have Code Veronica X and Resident Evil 4.

1597
02:06:22,774 --> 02:06:24,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And they will have 1,000 achievement points.

1598
02:06:25,796 --> 02:06:27,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh.

1599
02:06:27,597 --> 02:06:29,538
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yay.

1600
02:06:30,138 --> 02:06:34,481
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's going to have... Here's some of the achievements for Code Veronica.

1601
02:06:34,501 --> 02:06:36,762
[SPEAKER_07]: There's The Terror Begins, Escape from the Graveyard of Terror.

1602
02:06:37,442 --> 02:06:41,627
[SPEAKER_07]: A Change Father, Liberate the Changed Man, um, there's ones for encountering former S.T.A.R.S.

1603
02:06:41,667 --> 02:06:43,749
[SPEAKER_07]: captains, so basically it's stuff that happens in the game anyway.

1604
02:06:45,010 --> 02:06:46,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, uh,

1605
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:58,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there's a comparison up of the... You just have to look around on the internets, but there's a comparison between Resident Evil 4, the original, and the HD version.

1606
02:06:59,205 --> 02:07:05,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Since I don't have my GameCube hooked up anymore, or my... I mean, I can always use the Wii, but my friends borrowed Resident Evil 4.

1607
02:07:05,888 --> 02:07:07,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm actually really interested in this.

1608
02:07:07,989 --> 02:07:10,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Because unlike some people in the room, I really liked Resident Evil 4.

1609
02:07:11,530 --> 02:07:14,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't dislike Resident Evil 4, but I loved Code Veronica.

1610
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And I liked the second one best.

1611
02:07:17,093 --> 02:07:17,413
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1612
02:07:17,955 --> 02:07:25,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the two that are supposed to look like Leonardo DiCaprio totally got killed AkumaJP in the chatroom is asking, will I be able to save?

1613
02:07:27,882 --> 02:07:41,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you just will not be able to erase those saves As long as you have enough typewriter ribbon Perfect answer, DarkSakura, perfect answer I'm actually going to link the articles in the chatroom so people can watch the comparison Amazing

1614
02:07:43,237 --> 02:07:48,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us your tweets as our listeners do every week.

1615
02:07:49,483 --> 02:07:51,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will go through some of those tweets right now.

1616
02:07:52,345 --> 02:07:53,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see.

1617
02:07:54,827 --> 02:08:05,437
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, I want to do a tweet from Mad Gear Store who tweeted a bunch of people saying that there's a nice game selection in California Extreme and tweeted us a picture of some of the Bomani that was going up there.

1618
02:08:05,751 --> 02:08:07,832
[SPEAKER_05]: And I gotta say, I'm actually kind of sad.

1619
02:08:07,972 --> 02:08:09,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually, no, I'm not kind of sad.

1620
02:08:09,373 --> 02:08:11,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really sad that actually I missed California Extreme.

1621
02:08:12,134 --> 02:08:14,875
[SPEAKER_05]: It just, it was just on a bad weekend this year.

1622
02:08:14,895 --> 02:08:16,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lot going on this weekend, you guys.

1623
02:08:17,197 --> 02:08:18,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the others did too.

1624
02:08:18,437 --> 02:08:19,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just hard.

1625
02:08:20,058 --> 02:08:26,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have gone this morning, but I couldn't have justified paying 30 bucks and only being there about four hours, which is what would have happened.

1626
02:08:26,601 --> 02:08:29,302
[SPEAKER_07]: They all pack up the last day anyway.

1627
02:08:29,342 --> 02:08:32,504
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would have wanted to be there yesterday like all night long.

1628
02:08:32,975 --> 02:08:35,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So, unfortunately, I couldn't make that happen.

1629
02:08:36,338 --> 02:08:40,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue Swim tweeted us earlier in the week going, I usually listen to podcasts as I'm going to sleep.

1630
02:08:41,283 --> 02:08:44,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Had several episodes of OLR playing and I ended up dreaming about them.

1631
02:08:45,548 --> 02:08:47,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that creepy that people like dream of us?

1632
02:08:47,449 --> 02:08:48,631
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't hear what was in the dream.

1633
02:08:49,231 --> 02:08:50,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it wasn't an erotic dream.

1634
02:08:51,033 --> 02:08:52,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it was.

1635
02:08:56,624 --> 02:08:57,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Redertainment sent a tweet earlier.

1636
02:08:58,025 --> 02:09:00,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually responded to it, but I wanted to bring it up on the show.

1637
02:09:00,788 --> 02:09:05,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Redertainment asked, so when are you going to incorporate Google Plus into the show?

1638
02:09:05,972 --> 02:09:08,254
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the new social network everyone's talking about.

1639
02:09:09,135 --> 02:09:11,036
[SPEAKER_05]: We like to be on the cutting edge of those types of things.

1640
02:09:12,117 --> 02:09:15,158
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as we find a way to do it, we will.

1641
02:09:15,538 --> 02:09:25,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Google has actually asked that small and medium businesses stop making personal profiles because they will roll out a business thing, kind of like how Facebook has business pages.

1642
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:27,101
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to roll that out later in the year, I guess.

1643
02:09:27,561 --> 02:09:31,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So as long as we can do it for free or really cheap...

1644
02:09:32,282 --> 02:09:34,944
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to look at doing something like that where we can keep our fans posted.

1645
02:09:35,325 --> 02:09:38,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Assuming that Google Plus has something you want.

1646
02:09:38,808 --> 02:09:40,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, we're gamers like you.

1647
02:09:40,309 --> 02:09:44,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And if this whole thing ends up being spam, spamity, spam, spam, we wouldn't do that.

1648
02:09:44,633 --> 02:09:45,734
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to contribute to that.

1649
02:09:45,834 --> 02:09:54,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, if it's a place where you can be in a community and talk about games and meet other people that don't want to be jerks when playing online games, then I'm all for that.

1650
02:09:55,142 --> 02:09:55,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1651
02:09:56,463 --> 02:10:23,333
[SPEAKER_05]: but Google Plus, it's biggest problem right now is that there's not a lot there, like you can see what they're building and a lot of people are really liking what they see in the foundation but there's certainly a lot of other people who look at Google Plus and go, there's fucking nothing there right now, it's so vanilla so, I think Google Plus just needs some time to grow and then we can really see what we can do with it MNZiba you alright there?

1652
02:10:24,534 --> 02:10:25,554
[SPEAKER_05]: is a bug attacking you?

1653
02:10:27,321 --> 02:10:28,901
[SPEAKER_05]: is a fly attacking you for massive damage?

1654
02:10:28,941 --> 02:10:29,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Hit its weak point.

1655
02:10:30,382 --> 02:10:30,822
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1656
02:10:31,262 --> 02:10:32,922
[SPEAKER_05]: She got a Kleenex and hit its weak point.

1657
02:10:33,802 --> 02:10:34,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Squished it to death.

1658
02:10:35,943 --> 02:10:36,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I broke one of its wings.

1659
02:10:37,243 --> 02:10:37,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Yikes.

1660
02:10:37,663 --> 02:10:44,005
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Ziba sends us a tweet saying, this video made me go back to FFXI or Final Fantasy XI.

1661
02:10:44,045 --> 02:10:46,185
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of these scenes have you seen in game?

1662
02:10:46,986 --> 02:10:53,327
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking at a little scenery, a little quaint scene of plants growing.

1663
02:10:55,333 --> 02:10:55,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what this is.

1664
02:10:55,953 --> 02:10:57,735
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be like a... I've got to skip ahead a little bit.

1665
02:10:59,396 --> 02:11:03,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just some of the pretty shit in-game set to pretty music.

1666
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:05,960
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1667
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:07,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to say, it's funny.

1668
02:11:07,581 --> 02:11:12,645
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you sent this tweet before I told my story at the top of the break about how I got Final Fantasy XI bought for me.

1669
02:11:13,045 --> 02:11:21,451
[SPEAKER_05]: But it actually was thinking about a lot of the great scenery and ambience in that game, you know, despite the dated graphical technology, that had me thinking like...

1670
02:11:22,031 --> 02:11:46,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder what it looks like now like I wonder if they've made some changes and why Final Fantasy 14 was so fucking disappointing because it should have been 11 improved in high def but instead it was 11 flushed down a toilet in high def and that was what was very disappointing about it Red Entertainment sent us another tweet saying I'd like to start the rumor that the PlayStation 4 will feature Body Movin' the hit song from the Beastie Boys

1671
02:11:47,642 --> 02:11:47,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

1672
02:11:47,982 --> 02:11:49,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it rips off the Kinect.

1673
02:11:50,164 --> 02:11:51,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

1674
02:11:52,326 --> 02:11:59,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazernator tweets us and says, No news on free PlayStation Network videos for a while with the fact that my system being dead and needing to be repaired.

1675
02:12:00,072 --> 02:12:01,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I heard about this.

1676
02:12:01,193 --> 02:12:03,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess he got the yellow light of death on the PlayStation.

1677
02:12:04,395 --> 02:12:06,557
[SPEAKER_05]: He does not have good luck with PlayStation.

1678
02:12:07,177 --> 02:12:08,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet he supports it.

1679
02:12:08,458 --> 02:12:09,839
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to tell you something.

1680
02:12:10,019 --> 02:12:10,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1681
02:12:11,060 --> 02:12:11,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Rude Sony.

1682
02:12:12,061 --> 02:12:13,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Rude, rude Sony.

1683
02:12:15,407 --> 02:12:18,590
[SPEAKER_05]: SGO100 Matt tweets us, has Hollywood really run out of ideas?

1684
02:12:18,730 --> 02:12:21,152
[SPEAKER_05]: The Space Invaders movie rights have been optioned.

1685
02:12:21,832 --> 02:12:26,236
[SPEAKER_05]: And tweets us to a story, I guess, I thought this had already happened some time ago.

1686
02:12:26,936 --> 02:12:28,577
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's making the rounds again.

1687
02:12:29,398 --> 02:12:34,122
[SPEAKER_05]: The title classic arcade game Space Invaders has been optioned by veteran Hollywood producers.

1688
02:12:34,742 --> 02:12:39,886
[SPEAKER_05]: The film rights were optioned by Lorenzo de Benaventura, who made Transformers, G.I.

1689
02:12:39,926 --> 02:12:40,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe, and Salt.

1690
02:12:41,187 --> 02:12:46,193
[SPEAKER_05]: and Oddlot Entertainment, who is behind upcoming movies Drive and Ender's Game.

1691
02:12:47,094 --> 02:12:50,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they've also optioned Asteroids.

1692
02:12:51,773 --> 02:12:52,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, I see.

1693
02:12:52,414 --> 02:12:57,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, Warner Brothers allegedly was seeking the Space Invaders rights itself, but that venture fell through.

1694
02:12:59,218 --> 02:13:01,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Where would you make a fucking movie out of Space Invaders?

1695
02:13:02,239 --> 02:13:05,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, wouldn't it just be Independence Day, but called Space Invaders?

1696
02:13:06,122 --> 02:13:06,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1697
02:13:06,522 --> 02:13:09,164
[SPEAKER_05]: They're never going to make a better alien film than Independence Day.

1698
02:13:09,204 --> 02:13:13,346
[SPEAKER_07]: But the soundtrack would be bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

1699
02:13:13,486 --> 02:13:16,908
[SPEAKER_05]: No, well, the new Space Invaders games have fucking rad soundtracks.

1700
02:13:17,008 --> 02:13:18,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that would be cool.

1701
02:13:18,389 --> 02:13:20,671
[SPEAKER_05]: How about a techno-rave version of Independence Day?

1702
02:13:21,191 --> 02:13:21,291
Yeah.

1703
02:13:21,571 --> 02:13:22,031
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1704
02:13:23,032 --> 02:13:31,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Today is our Independence Day.

1705
02:13:31,918 --> 02:13:33,459
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S sent us a tweet.

1706
02:13:33,799 --> 02:13:36,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man to become a reality show.

1707
02:13:36,081 --> 02:13:37,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't this come up on last week's show?

1708
02:13:38,117 --> 02:13:39,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a little question mark over my head.

1709
02:13:39,818 --> 02:13:44,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'll quickly read this, but I guess Pac-Man is coming to life with a new reality series.

1710
02:13:44,899 --> 02:13:52,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Merv Griffin Entertainment is developing an unscripted show about the pellet-eating yellow blob chased by Inky, Binky, Pinky, and Clyde.

1711
02:13:52,702 --> 02:13:55,443
[SPEAKER_05]: It's to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the video game.

1712
02:13:56,043 --> 02:13:59,825
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big, crazy, wipeout-type event with a lot of energy.

1713
02:14:00,205 --> 02:14:03,406
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea we have is to take what Pac-Man is and bring it to life.

1714
02:14:03,806 --> 02:14:04,126
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com.

1715
02:14:17,219 --> 02:14:18,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1716
02:14:34,668 --> 02:14:35,189
[SPEAKER_05]: to hide $100,000.

1717
02:14:35,309 --> 02:14:46,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they can keep the money hidden from the feds for 48 hours or something like that, like actual federal agents that try to chase them down and the money for themselves, because the fed agents are competing for the money.

1718
02:14:46,976 --> 02:14:48,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if they can find it in 48 hours and they get to keep it.

1719
02:14:49,298 --> 02:14:51,119
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, that sounds kind of awesome.

1720
02:14:51,759 --> 02:14:54,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I like shows about like that type of stuff.

1721
02:14:54,721 --> 02:14:55,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I would do that.

1722
02:14:56,783 --> 02:14:58,064
[SPEAKER_05]: You would do, how would you hide the money?

1723
02:14:58,664 --> 02:14:59,885
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, how would you win that show?

1724
02:15:01,431 --> 02:15:08,034
[SPEAKER_04]: You package it up, send it second day air to somewhere, to your house or something like that.

1725
02:15:08,094 --> 02:15:13,216
[SPEAKER_05]: But couldn't the federal agents trace everywhere you've been and your steps and the packages you've sent?

1726
02:15:13,656 --> 02:15:13,796
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1727
02:15:14,656 --> 02:15:15,677
[SPEAKER_07]: You immediately invest it.

1728
02:15:17,625 --> 02:15:18,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve McQueen Movies

1729
02:15:41,584 --> 02:15:44,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what, look, I'm a game show addict.

1730
02:15:44,126 --> 02:15:49,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up on old school match game and USA Network game shows like Scrabble and Press Your Luck and all that shit.

1731
02:15:50,232 --> 02:15:52,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you watch Bumper Stumpers?

1732
02:15:52,294 --> 02:15:53,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucking love Bumper Stumpers.

1733
02:15:53,896 --> 02:15:55,337
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit was awesome.

1734
02:15:55,698 --> 02:15:59,842
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll tell you, my favorite reality game show they ever did

1735
02:16:00,522 --> 02:16:01,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Outro Music

1736

[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1737
02:16:44,086 --> 02:16:44,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate flies.

1738
02:16:44,686 --> 02:16:49,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Now keep in mind, I usually comfort myself by saying they'll die in two days anyway because they have a really short lifespan.

1739
02:16:49,710 --> 02:16:56,676
[SPEAKER_07]: But this fly has been buzzing all over my damn house so I have a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction and damn it, I deserve a Twinkie.

1740
02:16:57,882 --> 02:17:06,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we have a lot of fucking tweets today, but I gotta get through some of these others Okay, Sterlok tweets us, and now remember I said I wanted to hear from blind gamers?

1741
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:25,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Sterlok, I know, is a blind gamer, and tweets us about the whole glasses story from part A The glasses thing is actually pretty neat Don't have enough usable vision for that, but like the concept So, unfortunately, you know, it's not gonna work for everybody But it's still cool that it will help some people I think that's still really cool, and I think Sterlok sees that too

1742
02:17:26,227 --> 02:17:32,853
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw305 tweets us saying, Katamari creator working on a different kind of MMO.

1743
02:17:34,295 --> 02:17:37,718
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of MMO would the person behind Katamari Damacy make?

1744
02:17:38,699 --> 02:17:39,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1745
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:44,464
[SPEAKER_05]: TinySpec, a small developer founded by former Flickr employees.

1746
02:17:44,985 --> 02:17:50,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't Spec the name of PeeWee Herman's dog in the PeeWee's Big Adventure movie?

1747
02:17:51,630 --> 02:17:52,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Speck!

1748
02:17:52,511 --> 02:17:52,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1749
02:17:54,073 --> 02:17:55,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you were talking about what was in his pants.

1750
02:17:56,675 --> 02:17:56,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

1751
02:17:58,477 --> 02:18:09,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Announced today that Takahashi, who is the guy behind Katamari Damacy, moved from Tokyo to Vancouver to contribute to Glitch, its web-based MMOs.

1752
02:18:09,388 --> 02:18:10,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, there's even a trailer.

1753
02:18:10,369 --> 02:18:11,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take a look real quick.

1754
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:14,413
[SPEAKER_07]: He actually got hired to design a playground.

1755
02:18:16,437 --> 02:18:26,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I knew he was doing the playground, but I see all these people, like little avatars, and they're jumping around like it looks like a 2D platformer game.

1756
02:18:31,745 --> 02:18:34,407
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something LittleBigPlanet-ish about this to me.

1757
02:18:36,128 --> 02:18:41,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying that's what the game is, but it's just LittleBigPlanet on mushrooms.

1758
02:18:44,918 --> 02:18:46,059
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what this game is.

1759
02:18:46,119 --> 02:18:46,879
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks kind of like Gaia.

1760
02:18:46,899 --> 02:18:51,721
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a wheel and I quickly caught the text on that and it said booty prize.

1761
02:18:52,281 --> 02:18:52,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I said booty.

1762
02:18:55,482 --> 02:18:56,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it looks a little silly.

1763
02:18:58,444 --> 02:18:59,064
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of cool.

1764
02:19:01,516 --> 02:19:03,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess if it's free, I'll check it out.

1765
02:19:03,077 --> 02:19:06,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's not, I'll have to hear more about it to see if it's worth it.

1766
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:08,681
[SPEAKER_05]: One more tweet from Tigerclaw.

1767
02:19:08,741 --> 02:19:11,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo researching mobile phone possibilities.

1768
02:19:11,523 --> 02:19:12,563
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of a big deal.

1769
02:19:12,683 --> 02:19:13,564
[SPEAKER_05]: How did I miss that one?

1770
02:19:14,365 --> 02:19:15,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it, guys.

1771
02:19:16,886 --> 02:19:17,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1772
02:19:17,387 --> 02:19:24,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturo Water responded to a fantastic question pitched at a recent shareholder Q&A that began, I own some shares, but I do not have any Nintendo products.

1773
02:19:24,972 --> 02:19:31,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, I think games are a waste of time, and therefore I would like a product that has value added to it so that even I would buy one.

1774
02:19:32,016 --> 02:19:32,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1775
02:19:58,968 --> 02:20:05,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta say, no disrespect to the tweet or the story or what have you, but this sounds like a whole lot of nothing.

1776
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:06,711
[SPEAKER_05]: This sounds like a whole lot of absolutely nothing.

1777
02:20:06,731 --> 02:20:08,991
[SPEAKER_05]: This sounds like Iwata just completely dodging this question.

1778
02:20:09,532 --> 02:20:12,012
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't want to tell the guy, no, we're not doing a fucking mobile phone.

1779
02:20:12,052 --> 02:20:13,713
[SPEAKER_05]: He just wanted to give this big answer about...

1780
02:20:14,153 --> 02:20:18,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if we did that, we'd have to do this and this, but it's something we're always looking into.

1781
02:20:18,636 --> 02:20:29,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so that they'll say, oh, it's something we may be looking into, but when it comes to actually, you know, talking about games that they're porting over, oh, that, no.

1782
02:20:29,383 --> 02:20:35,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I had my hopes up that this was going to be a story about, like, I don't know, Mario Brothers on my iPhone or something.

1783
02:20:36,287 --> 02:20:37,108
[SPEAKER_05]: How silly of me.

1784
02:20:37,528 --> 02:20:38,409
[SPEAKER_05]: How silly of me.

1785
02:20:39,915 --> 02:20:44,241
[SPEAKER_05]: WatchDragon tweets us saying, going old school, just beat Tyrion.

1786
02:20:44,782 --> 02:20:46,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone remember Tyrion?

1787
02:20:48,738 --> 02:20:49,138
[SPEAKER_05]: anyone?

1788
02:20:49,718 --> 02:21:12,447
[SPEAKER_05]: it was an epic epic mega games shooter from 94 and the minute I saw a screen I admit I cheat and I googled it because I'm like what is this and the minute I saw a screenshot I'm like I played that fucking game back when it was shareware I guess the whole thing was released in 2007 as or no freeware in 04 and the graphics are open license as of April of 07 that's kind of cool

1789
02:21:13,922 --> 02:21:15,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Where can you download this game?

1790
02:21:15,043 --> 02:21:16,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give a shout out for the download.

1791
02:21:16,805 --> 02:21:17,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1792
02:21:20,689 --> 02:21:25,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Official Tyrian repository, freewebs.com slash worldtreegames.

1793
02:21:26,872 --> 02:21:27,252
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1794
02:21:28,493 --> 02:21:29,134
[SPEAKER_05]: One more tweet.

1795
02:21:29,374 --> 02:21:29,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Last tweet.

1796
02:21:29,954 --> 02:21:33,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Cananagram tweets us, Did y'all talk about Play for Japan coming out today?

1797
02:21:33,918 --> 02:21:35,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, many distractions on my end today.

1798
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, we didn't.

1799
02:21:37,340 --> 02:21:42,064
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't come up yet, so we should say that the Play for Japan album is out today.

1800
02:21:42,164 --> 02:21:49,130
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have not checked it out in iTunes to see if it's something you want to get and help out a good cause, you probably should do that after the show.

1801
02:21:50,071 --> 02:21:50,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Play for Japan is out.

1802
02:21:52,193 --> 02:21:53,237
[SPEAKER_05]: That does it for Twitter tonight.

1803
02:21:53,277 --> 02:21:56,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to get in on a future week.

1804
02:21:56,749 --> 02:21:57,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to gaming news.

1805
02:21:57,652 --> 02:21:57,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1806
02:21:59,149 --> 02:22:00,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm sorry.

1807
02:22:00,310 --> 02:22:03,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Distracted by a very, very strange picture of Katy Perry for some reason.

1808
02:22:04,773 --> 02:22:07,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it that she has, like, that?

1809
02:22:07,775 --> 02:22:08,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand it.

1810
02:22:08,636 --> 02:22:09,577
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't make any sense.

1811
02:22:09,597 --> 02:22:10,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is she famous?

1812
02:22:11,078 --> 02:22:11,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1813
02:22:11,858 --> 02:22:18,703
[SPEAKER_04]: She's famous because she's willing to wear a dress that has whipped cream dispensers on her nipples.

1814
02:22:18,803 --> 02:22:20,384
[SPEAKER_04]: That is why she is famous.

1815
02:22:21,305 --> 02:22:25,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta admit, she does have some good songs, but sometimes I feel like she's a better songwriter than...

1816
02:22:25,968 --> 02:22:29,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And she does have some good nipples, so, you know, that makes sense.

1817
02:22:29,550 --> 02:22:34,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is actually in the line again for another lawsuit.

1818
02:22:34,853 --> 02:22:37,995
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if it's not motion sensors, it's now going to be 3D.

1819
02:22:38,115 --> 02:22:42,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are facing a lawsuit over the 3DS technology, mainly the screen.

1820
02:22:43,538 --> 02:22:56,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, a company that you've probably never heard of before, Tomata Technologies has a patent suit against Nintendo because they have the patent for technology relating to displaying stereoscopic images on screen for viewing with the naked eye, i.e.

1821
02:22:57,115 --> 02:22:58,937
[SPEAKER_04]: without glasses or other devices.

1822
02:22:59,357 --> 02:22:59,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Filed in 2003, granted in 2008.

1823
02:23:02,581 --> 02:23:10,764
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course they've run up suits for the Wii Fit, GameCube, classic controllers, controller ports, etc.

1824
02:23:12,745 --> 02:23:16,366
[SPEAKER_04]: The funny thing about this though is Nintendo doesn't make those screens.

1825
02:23:16,466 --> 02:23:17,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharp does.

1826
02:23:19,347 --> 02:23:19,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

1827
02:23:21,087 --> 02:23:25,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So Nintendo licensed the screen technology from Sharp or whatever or contracted Sharp to put those screens in?

1828
02:23:27,710 --> 02:23:48,889
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of the people they were commenting as expected googled automata technologies feels the only notable thing they've ever done is sue Nintendo so once again one of those patent sniping companies I guess patent trolls I feel like patent trolls need a theme song here on the show we'll have to look into that for the future

1829
02:23:49,429 --> 02:23:56,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, I'm glad I waited to buy this game because the new version that's coming out on PlayStation Network sounds kind of awesome.

1830
02:23:56,554 --> 02:23:58,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Castlevania Harmony of Despair.

1831
02:23:58,756 --> 02:24:03,960
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't remember this game, it's the HD Castlevania game that was released almost a year ago on the Xbox 360.

1832
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:15,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It's finally coming out to the PlayStation 3, but the good news is your wait may pay off because the PSN version of the game, it will come with a new local four-player cooperative mode and

1833
02:24:15,988 --> 02:24:17,829
[SPEAKER_05]: including the six player online mode.

1834
02:24:18,369 --> 02:24:27,033
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also going to be the beauty, desire, situation, desire map pack and some extra carriers, carriers, characters that will carry whips and other weapons.

1835
02:24:27,554 --> 02:24:29,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Julius Belmont and Yoko Belenades.

1836
02:24:30,255 --> 02:24:31,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So kind of cool.

1837
02:24:31,756 --> 02:24:38,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I, you know, I played the demo of this game and I was kind of like, eh, but I have a lot of friends that are really into it and I think I need to give it a second chance.

1838
02:24:39,159 --> 02:24:40,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will definitely check it out on PSN.

1839
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:43,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, very cool.

1840
02:24:44,362 --> 02:24:44,802
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1841
02:24:46,465 --> 02:24:53,807
[SPEAKER_07]: In other news, for fans of Nights Like Me, there is an OC Remix album put out.

1842
02:24:54,067 --> 02:24:55,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Lucid Dreaming.

1843
02:24:55,627 --> 02:24:56,888
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a free download.

1844
02:24:57,648 --> 02:25:06,990
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has 25 arrangements and two bonus tracks from Nights Into Dreams.

1845
02:25:07,570 --> 02:25:12,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually put out as an anniversary release because 15 years ago it came out on Sega Saturn.

1846
02:25:13,932 --> 02:25:23,739
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is available at lucid.ocremix.org And I am going to be downloading the crap out of this when I'm done You love Nights, right?

1847
02:25:23,879 --> 02:25:31,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, Nights is fun, although it always made me motion sick But yeah, it's an overclocked remix The whole album is overclocked, so That's cool

1848
02:25:31,644 --> 02:25:35,967
[SPEAKER_05]: OC Remix has been getting more and more exposure, it seems, over the years.

1849
02:25:36,047 --> 02:25:41,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, didn't they do the remix soundtrack for the Street Fighter 2 remix?

1850
02:25:41,290 --> 02:25:45,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they said this is their 26th album that they've done.

1851
02:25:45,413 --> 02:25:50,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, but doesn't this have some type of backing by Sega, or no?

1852
02:25:50,356 --> 02:25:51,436
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a fan thing.

1853
02:25:51,576 --> 02:25:52,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was just a fan thing.

1854
02:25:52,677 --> 02:25:53,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my bad.

1855
02:25:53,437 --> 02:25:55,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought for some reason it was like an endorsed thing.

1856
02:25:56,099 --> 02:25:57,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, still really cool.

1857
02:25:57,139 --> 02:25:57,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1858
02:25:57,679 --> 02:26:01,220
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they've done a few fan albums, like the Final Fantasy VII one.

1859
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:02,841
[SPEAKER_05]: There was probably several, more than one.

1860
02:26:03,401 --> 02:26:05,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was a Mega Man one, too, so yeah, I'm not surprised.

1861
02:26:05,641 --> 02:26:06,561
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

1862
02:26:06,641 --> 02:26:12,943
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking, actually, at the website under About, and no, it doesn't say that.

1863
02:26:14,443 --> 02:26:19,024
[SPEAKER_07]: It just says Fan Project, so I'll link the website in the chat room.

1864
02:26:20,465 --> 02:26:20,785
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1865
02:26:21,405 --> 02:26:21,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1866
02:26:21,605 --> 02:26:21,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1867
02:26:23,444 --> 02:26:39,235
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was a matter of time, and we even hinted that this is something that may happen, and sure enough, Sony has announced, or I shouldn't even say they've announced, it was mainly found out that they were going to be doing this, and then they acknowledged, yeah, we're doing it.

1868
02:26:40,015 --> 02:26:45,539
[SPEAKER_04]: There is now going to be a PlayStation Network pass on first-party games from Sony.

1869
02:26:46,039 --> 02:26:50,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, this is just like the other online passes, Project $10, whatever the fuck you want to call it,

1870
02:26:51,383 --> 02:26:51,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Could it be $10?

1871
02:27:15,773 --> 02:27:16,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be $10.

1872
02:27:17,117 --> 02:27:17,659
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be $5.

1873
02:27:18,101 --> 02:27:19,827
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what other companies are doing.

1874
02:27:20,328 --> 02:27:21,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like this trend at all.

1875
02:27:21,633 --> 02:27:22,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just...

1876
02:27:24,156 --> 02:27:24,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know

1877
02:27:49,661 --> 02:27:57,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, it's just like if you use it, they're using the excuse, well, if you buy it used, the developer doesn't get any of that money.

1878
02:27:57,668 --> 02:28:00,431
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they already got that money when the game was purchased new.

1879
02:28:02,410 --> 02:28:03,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.

1880
02:28:03,851 --> 02:28:05,712
[SPEAKER_05]: But you should buy all your games new.

1881
02:28:05,972 --> 02:28:07,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a stupid argument.

1882
02:28:07,653 --> 02:28:14,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like you buy all your CDs new and just like how you buy all your clothes new and there's no such thing as a thrift store.

1883
02:28:15,598 --> 02:28:19,160
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Macy's doesn't get money when you buy that used clothes at a garage sale.

1884
02:28:21,101 --> 02:28:21,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad.

1885
02:28:22,322 --> 02:28:33,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you need to make your games better so that those people think that it's worth paying $60 for or you need to drop your prices down to a reasonable amount where people feel it's necessary to buy.

1886
02:28:35,467 --> 02:28:43,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, it's just after all the bullshit that they've done with other things, I don't know why people put up with it.

1887
02:28:43,829 --> 02:28:53,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way, if you're still interested in playing this game online and buying it new is not for you, what I recommend doing is waiting a good year before it drops down in price.

1888
02:28:53,771 --> 02:28:56,751
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's not good enough for you, then you better buy that sucker new.

1889
02:28:58,052 --> 02:29:04,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, just shop around, because a lot of people drop the prices of those games at launch, the

1890
02:29:05,314 --> 02:29:08,597
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkToyGax in our chatroom saying whoop whoop whoop 0% chance of buying PS3 now oops

1891
02:29:30,982 --> 02:29:35,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope Microsoft is smart and decides not to do this.

1892
02:29:35,623 --> 02:29:37,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that they say, hey, you know what?

1893
02:29:37,444 --> 02:29:41,845
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to jump on this bandwagon because I have a feeling that it's one of either way.

1894
02:29:42,045 --> 02:29:46,306
[SPEAKER_04]: They're either going to jump on it because everybody else is doing it or they're going to hold strong and say, hey, you know what?

1895
02:29:46,346 --> 02:29:53,609
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to do that because it's going to look really bad if they do it because they're charging for online and then they're charging again for you to get access on.

1896
02:29:53,629 --> 02:29:54,269
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know.

1897
02:29:55,635 --> 02:30:05,441
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I'm kind of at with Dark Togek because I'm like, you know, okay, I understand why you're pissed off at Sony, but I'm a little worried that this is just the first of everybody jumping on board with this.

1898
02:30:06,862 --> 02:30:12,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I don't buy a lot of games used, but I kind of like having that option available to me.

1899
02:30:12,925 --> 02:30:13,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the other thing, though.

1900
02:30:13,966 --> 02:30:14,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily used.

1901
02:30:14,726 --> 02:30:16,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when they go out of print.

1902
02:30:16,147 --> 02:30:17,168
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also rentals.

1903
02:30:17,288 --> 02:30:22,591
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going on Gamefly or something like that and you want to play the online portion of this, well, you're fucking out of luck.

1904
02:30:25,166 --> 02:30:27,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you want to pay $10 or whatever.

1905
02:30:29,507 --> 02:30:30,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

1906
02:30:31,607 --> 02:30:33,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about a Facebook game.

1907
02:30:33,808 --> 02:30:38,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, a Facebook game, but this is one that's been making a lot of heads turn this week.

1908
02:30:38,509 --> 02:30:41,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Civilization World finally launched on Facebook.

1909
02:30:41,469 --> 02:30:42,109
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you like that?

1910
02:30:42,189 --> 02:30:43,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember how I bitched about how I didn't have an invite?

1911
02:30:44,270 --> 02:30:47,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I did get one later that night, so thank you, DarkTetsuya, for hooking me up with that.

1912
02:30:47,750 --> 02:30:50,351
[SPEAKER_05]: But then not even three days later, it went public.

1913
02:30:51,472 --> 02:31:07,214
[SPEAKER_05]: and which is fine at least I got to have like a somewhat early look at it but yeah Civilization World is a new Facebook game and it's turning a lot of people's heads because a lot of people are going this is a really good game and it's a Facebook game I gotta be honest

1914
02:31:08,223 --> 02:31:09,184
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1915
02:31:28,143 --> 02:31:29,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1916
02:31:49,131 --> 02:31:56,578
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyhow, I was playing some of the game, and one of the things I really like about it is that you work with a nation.

1917
02:31:56,698 --> 02:32:07,689
[SPEAKER_05]: You can join a nation to kind of better yourselves, and you're supposed to be working with these people so that you can beat other nations and you can get the technologies you need to advance yourself as a nation.

1918
02:32:08,049 --> 02:32:11,753
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, you're kind of against these same people.

1919
02:32:12,133 --> 02:32:17,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's also competition going on amongst you guys for who is on top of your nation.

1920
02:32:17,958 --> 02:32:23,422
[SPEAKER_05]: And whoever's on the top of your nation gets more votes and a bigger say to drive the entire nation.

1921
02:32:24,003 --> 02:32:29,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of like that whole teamwork with a knife to your back type of thing.

1922
02:32:30,308 --> 02:32:32,710
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something about that kind of gameplay that's actually really rad.

1923
02:32:33,030 --> 02:32:36,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the element that this game has that no other Facebook game has.

1924
02:32:37,053 --> 02:32:39,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And why the rest of it being a really...

1925
02:32:40,737 --> 02:32:42,398
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1926
02:32:56,994 --> 02:32:58,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1927
02:33:12,288 --> 02:33:13,709
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1928
02:33:35,106 --> 02:33:58,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Zynga just is not capable of gaming an invention like this right now because I think they're just all about, you know, pushing out clones of what's essentially the same damn game between the Mafia Wars and the Sorority Wars and the Farmvilles and the Cityvilles and whatevervilles, so...

1929
02:33:59,986 --> 02:34:02,568
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, Civ World.

1930
02:34:02,668 --> 02:34:04,849
[SPEAKER_05]: The story is that yes, it is launched on Facebook.

1931
02:34:04,909 --> 02:34:07,411
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you are waiting for an invite, why wait?

1932
02:34:07,511 --> 02:34:08,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Go play.

1933
02:34:08,472 --> 02:34:10,653
[SPEAKER_05]: The game may be down for maintenance or something though.

1934
02:34:11,013 --> 02:34:18,759
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, in some of the reviews I'm hearing is that it has a lot of the just one more turn quantities of Civilization.

1935
02:34:19,139 --> 02:34:29,005
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, that's kind of true, but there is a point where there isn't a lot to do but hover your mouse over waiting for little bonus science outputs and things like that.

1936
02:34:29,065 --> 02:34:29,606
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

1937
02:34:30,006 --> 02:34:30,506
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of fun.

1938
02:34:33,349 --> 02:34:35,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's better than most Facebook games I've ever played.

1939
02:34:36,391 --> 02:34:38,413
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's more fun than a Facebook game, though?

1940
02:34:39,414 --> 02:34:40,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Emails!

1941
02:34:40,374 --> 02:34:49,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And the emails you send to us every week at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura's gonna dive into the Mailbag right now and read some emails for us to respond to.

1942
02:34:50,342 --> 02:34:52,503
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually got something from Holly.

1943
02:34:53,163 --> 02:34:53,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Holly!

1944
02:34:54,143 --> 02:34:55,963
[SPEAKER_07]: About the Commercial Felony Streaming Act.

1945
02:34:56,543 --> 02:34:57,704
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks for reporting on this.

1946
02:34:57,804 --> 02:35:01,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I've contacted my senator and my congressman, and I've sent it on to my friends and family.

1947
02:35:01,985 --> 02:35:05,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, if everyone tells them no, we can get this nonsense blocked.

1948
02:35:05,226 --> 02:35:06,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Bravo!

1949
02:35:06,466 --> 02:35:07,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

1950
02:35:07,046 --> 02:35:08,246
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what everybody should be doing.

1951
02:35:08,506 --> 02:35:10,387
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, we have a follow-up coming later in the show.

1952
02:35:10,587 --> 02:35:11,287
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to it in a minute.

1953
02:35:11,827 --> 02:35:12,687
[SPEAKER_07]: This comes from Rubba.

1954
02:35:13,067 --> 02:35:14,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Rubba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1955
02:35:14,748 --> 02:35:18,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Rubba-ba-ba, who I think added me on Steam the other day.

1956
02:35:18,709 --> 02:35:18,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

1957
02:35:18,970 --> 02:35:25,232
[SPEAKER_07]: You had a really good caller last week who discussed the kids that were crestfallen about the closure of Virtual Magic Kingdom.

1958
02:35:25,692 --> 02:35:27,753
[SPEAKER_07]: You also discussed the Star Wars Momo closing.

1959
02:35:28,193 --> 02:35:30,894
[SPEAKER_07]: These things are really good lessons to children and adults alike.

1960
02:35:30,994 --> 02:35:32,754
[SPEAKER_07]: They should learn, one, everything ends.

1961
02:35:32,834 --> 02:35:37,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Your dog will die, the batteries won't last forever, and MMOs are businesses that will stop supporting it someday.

1962
02:35:37,776 --> 02:35:40,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is more for the younger crowd.

1963
02:35:41,117 --> 02:35:42,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Virtual goods are not goods.

1964
02:35:42,898 --> 02:35:46,399
[SPEAKER_07]: They will someday disappear in an instant when the MMO closes.

1965
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:51,982
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why I find placing cash value on gold or items to be an utter waste of time.

1966
02:35:52,422 --> 02:35:54,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Adults still need to learn this lesson.

1967
02:35:55,483 --> 02:35:57,064
[SPEAKER_07]: You will not always get what you want.

1968
02:35:57,284 --> 02:36:00,205
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny that many of today's Americans don't understand this concept.

1969
02:36:00,405 --> 02:36:00,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Amen.

1970
02:36:02,026 --> 02:36:03,227
[SPEAKER_07]: and OnTheBrightSides4.

1971
02:36:03,547 --> 02:36:07,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Something new and shiny will come along to make you forget about the old MMO.

1972
02:36:07,970 --> 02:36:08,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So there we have it.

1973
02:36:09,011 --> 02:36:12,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Dealing with loss, bubble economies, humility and optimism.

1974
02:36:14,595 --> 02:36:16,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Things will end and your dog will die.

1975
02:36:17,017 --> 02:36:18,798
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of a Debbie Downer email.

1976
02:36:19,379 --> 02:36:21,700
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true though.

1977
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:23,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Your email gets a sad trombone.

1978
02:36:24,162 --> 02:36:25,402
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true though, isn't it?

1979
02:36:26,403 --> 02:36:31,964
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, but... It goes back to my old rant about Americans and the sense of self-entitlement.

1980
02:36:33,124 --> 02:36:37,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone thinks that everyone owes them something and they don't want to work for anything and you know what?

1981
02:36:38,326 --> 02:36:39,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Bite my ass.

1982
02:36:39,526 --> 02:36:42,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, except that's too much effort for you to come to my house and bite my ass.

1983
02:36:42,587 --> 02:36:48,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what about... Oh, you better be careful because there's some creepsters out there who might actually try to show up at your door and say, I'm here to bite your ass, ma'am.

1984
02:36:48,468 --> 02:36:49,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll kick them in the balls.

1985
02:36:51,729 --> 02:36:52,269
[SPEAKER_05]: What if it's a girl?

1986
02:36:53,444 --> 02:36:54,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll kick her in the clit.

1987
02:36:56,466 --> 02:36:57,526
[SPEAKER_07]: That hurts kind of bad.

1988
02:36:57,786 --> 02:36:58,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I would imagine.

1989
02:36:58,927 --> 02:37:00,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, wow, I just didn't think you'd say that.

1990
02:37:01,608 --> 02:37:05,270
[SPEAKER_05]: But what about the whole angle of, but I paid for stuff in the game.

1991
02:37:05,630 --> 02:37:08,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize the address is in the email, but I don't know.

1992
02:37:08,372 --> 02:37:13,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see the disappointment if you've actually put money and time into this and then suddenly it's like, oh, I pulled the plug.

1993
02:37:13,955 --> 02:37:14,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?

1994
02:37:14,515 --> 02:37:16,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be disappointed and sad when my cat dies.

1995
02:37:17,036 --> 02:37:18,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you poured a lot of money into her.

1996
02:37:19,079 --> 02:37:23,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I've paid for her vet visits and I've bought that bed down there and I feed her and I take care of her.

1997
02:37:24,322 --> 02:37:25,563
[SPEAKER_07]: But one day she's gonna go.

1998
02:37:25,883 --> 02:37:27,564
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm very sad.

1999
02:37:27,604 --> 02:37:28,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I love my cat.

2000
02:37:28,485 --> 02:37:32,887
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I've... My computer here, I've got all this shit on it.

2001
02:37:32,907 --> 02:37:35,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Grandma and Grandpa gonna die.

2002
02:37:37,070 --> 02:37:40,652
[SPEAKER_07]: But you don't need to tell them that because they already know.

2003
02:37:40,832 --> 02:37:41,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know when.

2004
02:37:43,054 --> 02:37:46,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how, but one day they gonna die.

2005
02:37:53,209 --> 02:37:54,869
[SPEAKER_07]: But you don't need to tell them that.

2006
02:37:54,969 --> 02:37:56,389
[SPEAKER_07]: World of Warcraft?

2007
02:37:56,469 --> 02:37:57,610
[SPEAKER_00]: They know already.

2008
02:37:58,710 --> 02:38:04,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I mean, but seriously, you know, your PlayStation's gonna break one day.

2009
02:38:06,451 --> 02:38:07,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask Spazinator.

2010
02:38:07,672 --> 02:38:09,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, yeah, Spazinator should know all about that.

2011
02:38:10,792 --> 02:38:12,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Your Xbox is gonna red ring.

2012
02:38:14,733 --> 02:38:19,034
[SPEAKER_07]: That little beta that you've got in your pot on your desk at work is gonna die.

2013
02:38:21,366 --> 02:38:24,968
[SPEAKER_07]: One day your house will burn down and you won't live there anymore.

2014
02:38:25,168 --> 02:38:28,549
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but seriously, everything has an end.

2015
02:38:29,490 --> 02:38:29,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Face it.

2016
02:38:30,690 --> 02:38:32,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because you liked it and it was fun.

2017
02:38:33,031 --> 02:38:34,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Including OLR.

2018
02:38:34,852 --> 02:38:35,092
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2019
02:38:35,593 --> 02:38:41,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because you liked it and it was fun doesn't mean you get to have it forever.

2020
02:38:43,016 --> 02:38:43,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Grow up.

2021
02:38:45,957 --> 02:38:46,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2022
02:38:47,318 --> 02:38:47,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Last one.

2023
02:38:48,058 --> 02:38:49,099
[SPEAKER_07]: And it comes from Robert M.

2024
02:38:51,184 --> 02:38:53,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I recently picked up Atari's Greatest Hits Vol.

2025
02:38:53,306 --> 02:38:58,489
[SPEAKER_07]: 1 on the DS, first major points off for including Atari VideoCube instead of Yars' Revenge.

2026
02:38:59,290 --> 02:39:06,075
[SPEAKER_07]: The games do play very well, though, and although the small screen hurts arcade games such as Gravatar, they control pretty spot-on to the originals.

2027
02:39:06,595 --> 02:39:11,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed on the back of the box the proclamation, the most popular casual games of all time.

2028
02:39:12,019 --> 02:39:12,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

2029
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:17,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you consider retro games to be casual, you know, unless you're Steve Weeby or something?

2030
02:39:20,412 --> 02:39:27,198
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just different back then Interesting, interesting I think a lot of retro games were just very simple in concept Were they casual?

2031
02:39:27,458 --> 02:39:45,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people take a casual approach to it Because I know when you have emulators And you can sample everything at the buffet People will play games for five seconds and be all I remember this Next game I remember this It's like you lick the vanilla ice cream This tastes good You lick the chocolate ice cream This tastes good too

2032
02:39:46,134 --> 02:39:51,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day, when you would drop $50 on those games, they entertained you for a long time.

2033
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:57,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually going to use a comparison from design theory, actually.

2034
02:40:00,726 --> 02:40:09,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Back then, first of all, you didn't have a lot of space to actually store the game on, so you had to do the most you could with the most simple of tools by today's standards, right?

2035
02:40:10,353 --> 02:40:13,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, we had a longer attention span as people back then.

2036
02:40:13,856 --> 02:40:14,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think so.

2037
02:40:15,277 --> 02:40:16,319
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2038
02:40:30,319 --> 02:40:30,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2039
02:40:46,956 --> 02:41:00,463
[SPEAKER_05]: buy it or if it's like a catalog for Abercrombie and Fitch it's just naked good-looking 20 year olds butts but it's to sell clothes and they sell clothes through nudity

2040
02:41:00,973 --> 02:41:02,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but okay.

2041
02:41:03,275 --> 02:41:14,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Where it's like you pull up a 50s ad for the toasters and it's like, this makes some fucking amazing toast and the toast will brown just right and Mrs. Cleaver loves it and she uses this toaster every day.

2042
02:41:14,402 --> 02:41:20,306
[SPEAKER_05]: This toaster really gets my toast buttered and I love this toaster and it's economical and it looks great in the kitchen.

2043
02:41:22,568 --> 02:41:28,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually remember recently seeing an article for these ugly-ass plaid bell-bottom pants, but it was an ad from the 70s.

2044
02:41:29,135 --> 02:41:34,561
[SPEAKER_07]: And it said, like, something stretch-fiber pants for today's modern man.

2045
02:41:34,982 --> 02:41:38,245
[SPEAKER_07]: These type of pants are for the man who wants to get up and put on his pants and go.

2046
02:41:38,305 --> 02:41:39,246
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really...

2047
02:41:39,987 --> 02:41:43,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Describing it, you know, like you were watching a TV commercial or something.

2048
02:41:43,750 --> 02:41:50,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, even television commercials now are pretty simple to the point, you know, because our attention spans are shorter.

2049
02:41:51,135 --> 02:41:56,158
[SPEAKER_07]: We are bombarded with so much information and it just gets to be more and more.

2050
02:41:56,218 --> 02:42:06,865
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be like our photo albums in the future are going to be like from the last Starfighter when the dude shows the little square and it's like 50 million pictures all at once when dude's like, here's my photo, there's them and them.

2051
02:42:06,885 --> 02:42:09,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wouldn't that just be like one of those digital picture frames?

2052
02:42:11,169 --> 02:42:12,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, except it does a photo a second.

2053
02:42:13,852 --> 02:42:16,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I think it did like a photo every half second or something.

2054
02:42:16,596 --> 02:42:20,802
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, the point is, is that we had longer attention spans back then.

2055
02:42:21,202 --> 02:42:27,110
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a little bit more in the way of determination, we were satisfied with less because back then that was our big thing.

2056
02:42:28,763 --> 02:42:45,379
[SPEAKER_07]: and then it keeps pushing the envelope and pushing the envelope and now we have such high expectations that really if it doesn't hit that factor where something's going to change every five seconds and hold your attention, that's exactly what's going to happen.

2057
02:42:45,399 --> 02:42:47,481
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to lose interest in it and you're going to move on.

2058
02:42:48,642 --> 02:42:50,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of which, let's get to the next email.

2059
02:42:51,104 --> 02:42:52,145
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no more emails.

2060
02:42:53,026 --> 02:42:53,907
[SPEAKER_07]: No more.

2061
02:42:54,187 --> 02:42:55,449
[SPEAKER_07]: We're out of email.

2062
02:42:56,530 --> 02:42:59,233
[SPEAKER_05]: And just like that, the Mailbag segment has died this week.

2063
02:42:59,814 --> 02:43:04,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to contribute to next week's Mailbag.

2064
02:43:04,619 --> 02:43:06,441
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, let's get to some FUs of the week.

2065
02:43:26,245 --> 02:43:29,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have an FU, actually.

2066
02:43:30,412 --> 02:43:32,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, FU to alcohol for making my face break out.

2067
02:43:32,937 --> 02:43:33,317
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

2068
02:43:34,559 --> 02:43:34,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

2069
02:43:38,932 --> 02:43:42,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a lot of FUs because I'm coming off a high of a really, really great weekend.

2070
02:43:42,635 --> 02:43:48,178
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say I did have a really bad day this week where just a lot of stuff was going on.

2071
02:43:48,238 --> 02:43:49,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of it was work-related.

2072
02:43:50,019 --> 02:43:52,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, everything that I had talked about on WoW.

2073
02:43:53,221 --> 02:43:53,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of funny.

2074
02:43:54,062 --> 02:44:02,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I took it out on this week's episode of Horde House because a lot of my guildies that I've been playing with for a couple years now

2075
02:44:03,148 --> 02:44:08,852
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them listened to the show, and I actually was getting text messages from people going, God, you are so cunty on this week's Horde House.

2076
02:44:09,852 --> 02:44:14,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, I was having a bad day, and I got home at 5.55, and the show had to start at 6.

2077
02:44:15,076 --> 02:44:15,977
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want from me?

2078
02:44:17,618 --> 02:44:25,984
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise, things are fucking fantabulous, and I had an amazing weekend, and it erased the memory of my bad day.

2079
02:44:28,586 --> 02:44:30,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for the fact that I did remember to rant about it.

2080
02:44:30,907 --> 02:44:31,468
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it's done.

2081
02:44:31,568 --> 02:44:31,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

2082
02:44:33,695 --> 02:44:34,916
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not done with the news yet, though.

2083
02:44:34,936 --> 02:44:36,277
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a few more stories for you guys.

2084
02:44:36,337 --> 02:44:41,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2085
02:44:41,560 --> 02:44:42,881
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not there quite yet.

2086
02:44:43,662 --> 02:44:57,131
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I've kept Twitter open in another window, and we got another tweet that came in real quick from Zether77 tweeted us saying, you can also get Tyrion, because we mentioned that game earlier, on good old games.

2087
02:44:57,651 --> 02:44:58,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Gog.

2088
02:44:59,232 --> 02:45:01,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not aware, but now I am.

2089
02:45:01,714 --> 02:45:02,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder how much.

2090
02:45:02,354 --> 02:45:03,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to check that out.

2091
02:45:04,335 --> 02:45:06,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to a couple more news stories for you guys.

2092
02:45:07,416 --> 02:45:16,139
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about last week Senate Bill 978 where it may affect gameplay videos on YouTube and stuff like that.

2093
02:45:16,179 --> 02:45:31,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you uploaded pictures of yourself playing a game or something like that and showing the gameplay, that may be considered copyrighted acts and that you'd be basically slapped with a felony charge and jail time.

2094
02:45:32,143 --> 02:45:37,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, though, the way the bill is worded now, they're saying that it actually may not be the case.

2095
02:45:37,847 --> 02:45:51,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the statute can only be enforced in instances where uploaders are willfully infringing on copyright with the intent to make money and is only punishable if said uploader makes or the game company loses over $2,500.

2096
02:45:52,175 --> 02:45:57,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's probably not going to be the case for most walkthroughs and stuff like that.

2097
02:45:57,918 --> 02:45:59,539
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't totally change my opinion.

2098
02:45:59,759 --> 02:46:00,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I still think it's stupid.

2099
02:46:01,039 --> 02:46:06,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this report that you are giving us, I mean, don't blame you.

2100
02:46:06,481 --> 02:46:23,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're getting it from a game blog somewhere and what folks are reporting on the web, but it's a little bit smoke and mirrors to me because I don't think it detracts from the real issue that, okay, well, whereas a lot of individuals, what about the middleman review companies from businesses that are not IGN, 1UP, etc.,

2101
02:46:24,889 --> 02:46:30,746
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, still need those hits I mean, for me, this is really bad for small business

2102
02:46:31,894 --> 02:46:35,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because, I mean, they say, oh, well, you know, unless the company loses over $2,500.

2103
02:46:35,977 --> 02:46:43,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but, you know, the RIA said that, oh, these record companies have lost millions of dollars from one MP3 download.

2104
02:46:43,782 --> 02:46:48,044
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they can make that shit up off the top of their heads.

2105
02:46:48,124 --> 02:46:54,568
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, why not say, oh, yeah, this YouTube video of some of the gameplay streaming, that cost us so much money.

2106
02:46:55,729 --> 02:46:58,831
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you prove that a YouTube lost $2,500?

2107
02:47:00,612 --> 02:47:05,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't a game company say, because you gave my game a negative review, we lost all these sales?

2108
02:47:06,175 --> 02:47:08,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody that watched your thing was a potential sale?

2109
02:47:09,076 --> 02:47:10,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that seems so vague to prove.

2110
02:47:10,717 --> 02:47:13,059
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a shittily written law, just like I said last week.

2111
02:47:13,099 --> 02:47:15,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I used that word last week, and I'm using it again.

2112
02:47:15,420 --> 02:47:15,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Shittily.

2113
02:47:17,541 --> 02:47:18,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Shittily's law.

2114
02:47:20,443 --> 02:47:22,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not good.

2115
02:47:26,127 --> 02:47:30,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, let's talk about Origin vs. Steam and some of the follow-ups to that.

2116
02:47:30,872 --> 02:47:34,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I teased this a little bit before and after this story we'll get into your calls.

2117
02:47:35,056 --> 02:47:43,585
[SPEAKER_05]: A forum post was posted by EA's Senior Vice President of Global E-Commerce saying that gamers should be able to buy EA titles on any site they want, including Steam.

2118
02:47:44,445 --> 02:47:55,774
[SPEAKER_05]: But, here's the thing, I guess what happened is that the Crysis 2 disappearing from Valve's service was the result of a business deal where certain DLC for the game couldn't appear on Steam.

2119
02:47:56,234 --> 02:47:58,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So Valve removed the title completely.

2120
02:47:59,076 --> 02:48:02,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, Valve is like, you know, because we...

2121
02:48:02,739 --> 02:48:08,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Valve wants to facilitate all the downloads and patches within its own system, which for us, the consumer, I think is really good.

2122
02:48:08,585 --> 02:48:09,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's why a lot of us like Steam.

2123
02:48:10,267 --> 02:48:12,990
[SPEAKER_05]: But EA's like, no, we want control of that.

2124
02:48:13,050 --> 02:48:14,851
[SPEAKER_05]: So now there's a power struggle going on here.

2125
02:48:15,663 --> 02:48:23,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyhow, the forum post went on to say that the Origin platform is a choice for game buyers, not an exclusive outlet for all the publisher's content going forwards.

2126
02:48:24,014 --> 02:48:27,979
[SPEAKER_05]: EA is working to integrate more and more between the game and Origin, according to the post.

2127
02:48:28,901 --> 02:48:31,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely not at this point saying, hey, it's Origin versus Steam.

2128
02:48:31,864 --> 02:48:32,926
[SPEAKER_05]: It's never been about that.

2129
02:48:35,547 --> 02:48:37,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I totally believe that, but we'll see.

2130
02:48:39,349 --> 02:48:42,811
[SPEAKER_05]: EA wants to continue offering our games for sale on all major download sites.

2131
02:48:43,611 --> 02:48:50,175
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you say that on one hand, and then on the other hand, didn't they announce that Star Wars The Old Republic will only be on the new EA store?

2132
02:48:50,195 --> 02:48:50,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

2133
02:48:50,695 --> 02:48:50,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2134
02:48:51,255 --> 02:48:54,177
[SPEAKER_05]: So already there is a contradiction in your post.

2135
02:48:54,337 --> 02:48:58,139
[SPEAKER_05]: So it makes me a little bit apprehensive to believe anything else you're saying.

2136
02:48:59,522 --> 02:49:06,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, EA posted some digital retailers that are going to be carrying Battlefield 3 and guess who's not on it?

2137
02:49:07,006 --> 02:49:09,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's totally not Origin vs. Steam.

2138
02:49:09,967 --> 02:49:10,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, not at all.

2139
02:49:10,547 --> 02:49:20,511
[SPEAKER_04]: It has nothing to do with trying to crack... It's because they're really trying to offer download content on their own and Steam is being so bad and not letting them do that.

2140
02:49:21,312 --> 02:49:21,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Wah.

2141
02:49:22,990 --> 02:49:24,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who to root for in this case.

2142
02:49:24,832 --> 02:49:30,357
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a part of me that's like, well, you know, if EA really wants that, why does Steam need that?

2143
02:49:30,477 --> 02:49:36,283
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess that's part of what Steam kind of sells itself on is that all the patching and stuff goes through us.

2144
02:49:36,663 --> 02:49:43,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So if your server goes down EA and the game can't patch, we're not dealing on our promise as Steam.

2145
02:49:44,534 --> 02:49:45,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that makes sense.

2146
02:49:46,216 --> 02:49:49,260
[SPEAKER_05]: It does, but I am a little bit torn.

2147
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:56,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I also see where EA says, but I shouldn't have to, every time we want to roll out a patch or something, get permission from Steam to do it.

2148
02:49:56,989 --> 02:50:00,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they'd need permission, but I think that they need to host those files on Steam.

2149
02:50:01,792 --> 02:50:12,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're just throwing a little hissy fit because they can't make... I don't think they like the fact that Steam is taking some of their money for the download content and they want all of it.

2150
02:50:12,802 --> 02:50:13,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

2151
02:50:13,483 --> 02:50:14,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

2152
02:50:14,243 --> 02:50:15,064
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it sounds like to me.

2153
02:50:15,745 --> 02:50:19,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Really interesting feedback in the chat room and check which way this is tilting so far.

2154
02:50:20,989 --> 02:50:26,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, Zether in our chat says, they aren't putting Battlefield 3 on Steam because of the DLC clause as well.

2155
02:50:26,654 --> 02:50:27,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Not going to buy from EA again.

2156
02:50:28,636 --> 02:50:48,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says, screw EA, Kaijudo says, Valve, you guys are better than EA, tell EA to fuck off, and Randy says, agreed, fuck EA, and DDR Dollar Bill says, fuck EA, so there's a pretty, I mean, looking at the fans, most people seem to be on Team Valve, it chatters, is anybody Team EA, curious?

2157
02:50:50,165 --> 02:50:53,750
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of it that says, or Ranma says buy used.

2158
02:50:54,611 --> 02:50:58,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I don't think you can buy used PC product, really.

2159
02:50:59,217 --> 02:51:01,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you just go out to the store and buy it.

2160
02:51:01,740 --> 02:51:03,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you don't need that digital copy.

2161
02:51:03,383 --> 02:51:04,985
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just go buy it at a store.

2162
02:51:07,793 --> 02:51:08,193
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2163
02:51:08,393 --> 02:51:09,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just buy a console version.

2164
02:51:10,215 --> 02:51:13,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other things on the whole Origin stuff.

2165
02:51:14,037 --> 02:51:18,960
[SPEAKER_05]: One other thing I want to mention is about the Origin is actually coming to the iPod, iPhone, and Android.

2166
02:51:18,980 --> 02:51:23,723
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a cross-platform Scrabble game coming for free to Android.

2167
02:51:23,743 --> 02:51:24,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

2168
02:51:25,264 --> 02:51:27,546
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, that is something that Steam doesn't do.

2169
02:51:27,686 --> 02:51:30,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Steam doesn't deal in the iPad iOS universe right now.

2170
02:51:30,888 --> 02:51:49,122
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a part of me though that's like well how does that work because I thought Apple had the exclusive stuff on that like I thought you had to do everything through Apple so how do you launch a new store unless it's like the origin app that has all these mini games that you can buy within it like that has to be what it is yeah right interesting

2171
02:51:50,102 --> 02:52:15,267
[SPEAKER_05]: EA did demo the mobile offering the Origin app will let you see your friend list which I'm assuming is across the computer and the phone the accompanying news feed and sharing what everybody is doing on Origin no matter what platform that they're on there's a new version of Need for Speed on iOS and it was launched from Origin and Origin pushes your friend's leaderboard data into the game and they said at EA that this was not possible before Origin

2172
02:52:17,361 --> 02:52:21,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they can say whatever they want, but I mean, I think, you know, it's possible.

2173
02:52:21,604 --> 02:52:23,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at, you know, OpenFaint.

2174
02:52:25,306 --> 02:52:29,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but OpenFaint isn't really an app.

2175
02:52:29,489 --> 02:52:32,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an enhancement to existing apps.

2176
02:52:32,730 --> 02:52:43,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but they're saying that it wasn't possible to be able to share leaderboard data without EA's origin thing, but that's bullshit because... There's GameCenter.

2177
02:52:44,329 --> 02:52:49,576
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Game Center and there's OpenFaint, and I'm sure that other people can find ways to do stuff like that.

2178
02:52:49,717 --> 02:52:51,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, whatever.

2179
02:52:51,759 --> 02:52:51,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

2180
02:52:52,881 --> 02:52:53,582
[SPEAKER_04]: PR spin.

2181
02:52:54,523 --> 02:53:01,233
[SPEAKER_05]: GamerGirl in chat says, only for Sims, but otherwise EA stands for Eat Ass, as in EA eats ass.

2182
02:53:04,954 --> 02:53:08,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, I liked EA better when they were known as Electronic Arts.

2183
02:53:08,756 --> 02:53:11,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked EA better when they were ECA.

2184
02:53:11,577 --> 02:53:13,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to go back in time a little bit?

2185
02:53:13,918 --> 02:53:19,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out some of the loading screens on my favorite Commodore 64 games like Pinball Construction Set was an ECA game.

2186
02:53:22,042 --> 02:53:23,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anybody ever play Pinball Construction Set?

2187
02:53:24,643 --> 02:53:25,803
[SPEAKER_05]: That game was fucking rad.

2188
02:53:26,023 --> 02:53:26,263
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2189
02:53:27,284 --> 02:53:27,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

2190
02:53:30,474 --> 02:53:30,775
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

2191
02:53:30,835 --> 02:53:31,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take some calls.

2192
02:53:31,556 --> 02:53:32,958
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2193
02:53:33,018 --> 02:53:34,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2194
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:43,030
[SPEAKER_05]: The Skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight on the show or something else that you think we haven't covered yet.

2195
02:53:43,410 --> 02:53:44,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Skype line is open.

2196
02:53:45,193 --> 02:53:48,617
[SPEAKER_05]: While we wait for some calls, thanks to the delay, Loki, you have any last-minute stories for us?

2197
02:53:48,717 --> 02:53:49,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

2198
02:53:49,698 --> 02:53:51,959
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that came out this week was kind of cool.

2199
02:53:51,979 --> 02:54:00,003
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a mod for Call of Duty Modern Warfare that basically turned it into a version of Battlefront.

2200
02:54:00,323 --> 02:54:02,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can actually go check that out.

2201
02:54:02,524 --> 02:54:07,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're calling it Star... I can't remember what the hell they called it now.

2202
02:54:08,467 --> 02:54:08,728
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like...

2203
02:54:13,111 --> 02:54:40,443
[SPEAKER_04]: some Star Wars game I gotta find the damn link now it looked neat though I mean it basically looked like Battlefront so whenever that actually makes its way out but it's finally done you can actually download it for free yay free exactly I guess they're selling 8-bit glasses now they kinda look stupid if you ask me yeah I saw them too and I was like meh

2204
02:54:41,766 --> 02:54:42,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see that they have an app?

2205
02:54:42,847 --> 02:54:45,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember we were saying that it might happen or something like that?

2206
02:54:45,309 --> 02:54:53,017
[SPEAKER_04]: But the free-to-be-kicked, it was for the people that are playing free-to-play Team Fortress 2 that they get kicked out.

2207
02:54:53,057 --> 02:54:57,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I was saying that's everything that's wrong with gaming culture, but yeah.

2208
02:54:57,521 --> 02:54:58,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that kind of sucks.

2209
02:55:01,165 --> 02:55:03,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here if I can find this here.

2210
02:55:03,227 --> 02:55:03,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, there we go.

2211
02:55:03,747 --> 02:55:05,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Galactic Warfare is what it was.

2212
02:55:05,909 --> 02:55:06,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

2213
02:55:07,947 --> 02:55:08,387
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd it go?

2214
02:55:09,628 --> 02:55:10,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2215
02:55:10,529 --> 02:55:21,118
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can find that on the ModDB website.

2216
02:55:21,738 --> 02:55:22,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

2217
02:55:23,737 --> 02:55:25,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, moddb.com.

2218
02:55:25,238 --> 02:55:29,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Just search for the Star Wars Galactic Warfare mod for Call of Duty 4.

2219
02:55:31,542 --> 02:55:32,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks pretty awesome.

2220
02:55:35,185 --> 02:55:35,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2221
02:55:35,945 --> 02:55:37,567
[SPEAKER_04]: What other stuff we could talk about here?

2222
02:55:37,927 --> 02:55:39,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, Skyplane is open.

2223
02:55:39,348 --> 02:55:40,669
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2224
02:55:40,749 --> 02:55:42,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2225
02:55:42,550 --> 02:55:43,611
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll give it another couple minutes.

2226
02:55:43,631 --> 02:55:44,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe nobody wants to call tonight.

2227
02:55:48,054 --> 02:55:54,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Zether in our chat says, apparently Sega may not be releasing the second Phantasy Star PSP game or Valkyria Chronicles 3 here.

2228
02:55:54,520 --> 02:56:00,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was reading about that second Phantasy Star PSP game, but I'm more looking forward to this whole Phantasy Star Online 2.

2229
02:56:00,405 --> 02:56:01,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember?

2230
02:56:01,526 --> 02:56:02,246
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still coming.

2231
02:56:03,728 --> 02:56:04,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to try it out.

2232
02:56:04,749 --> 02:56:05,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.

2233
02:56:06,210 --> 02:56:08,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Zether says it's possibly due to piracy causing poor sales.

2234
02:56:09,994 --> 02:56:10,875
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2235
02:56:26,673 --> 02:56:41,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Xbox Live Indie games creators are expressing their disappointment with the low sales on the service they say that there's not enough exposure for their games and like for example there was you know

2236
02:56:42,069 --> 02:56:45,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Sequence, which sold around 2,000 copies.

2237
02:56:46,071 --> 02:56:47,432
[SPEAKER_04]: They said it's kind of a flop.

2238
02:56:47,792 --> 02:56:50,453
[SPEAKER_04]: He's looking at PC and mobile platforms for future projects.

2239
02:56:50,613 --> 02:57:01,358
[SPEAKER_04]: He says it's not financially viable to do a large-scale project and not expect with any certainty to make some money on the indie marketplace.

2240
02:57:01,458 --> 02:57:07,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they said that Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World, both pretty well-known games,

2241
02:57:08,401 --> 02:57:27,376
[SPEAKER_04]: on the marketplaces sold 50,000 and 16,000 copies each respectively making them relative hits for indie games and they said I think that our games could sell a lot better than they did with a better platform more visibility and he's testing that by releasing both of them on Steam on July 13th for $3

2242
02:57:29,215 --> 02:57:30,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, the phone's finally lighting up.

2243
02:57:30,456 --> 02:57:31,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see who's on the other line.

2244
02:57:31,496 --> 02:57:32,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2245
02:57:32,517 --> 02:57:32,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2246
02:57:33,417 --> 02:57:34,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend of Zaku here.

2247
02:57:34,378 --> 02:57:34,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, buddy.

2248
02:57:34,758 --> 02:57:35,198
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

2249
02:57:35,938 --> 02:57:36,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing much.

2250
02:57:36,639 --> 02:57:38,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like relaxing.

2251
02:57:38,900 --> 02:57:39,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss New York.

2252
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:40,560
[SPEAKER_02]: For tomorrow.

2253
02:57:41,041 --> 02:57:43,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, I had like a nasty weekend of just working.

2254
02:57:45,223 --> 02:57:48,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I had to show up to work on a Saturday.

2255
02:57:48,284 --> 02:57:49,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Working on the weekend.

2256
02:57:49,565 --> 02:57:51,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, life sucks.

2257
02:57:51,526 --> 02:57:53,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had to work on Saturday, too.

2258
02:57:53,827 --> 02:57:55,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm going to need you to come in on Saturday.

2259
02:57:56,400 --> 02:58:00,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think my boss was jokingly referring to that.

2260
02:58:01,242 --> 02:58:03,203
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the Bill Lumberg voice.

2261
02:58:03,483 --> 02:58:04,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great, great.

2262
02:58:04,924 --> 02:58:06,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least he had a sense of humor about it.

2263
02:58:07,185 --> 02:58:12,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but at least it got done yesterday, and at least I'm relaxing today.

2264
02:58:12,727 --> 02:58:12,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2265
02:58:14,048 --> 02:58:18,850
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, yeah, that whole EA Origin thing, yeah.

2266
02:58:19,642 --> 02:58:25,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I was betting the barn on Battlefield 3 showing up on Steam, but because of this shit, I don't know.

2267
02:58:25,128 --> 02:58:28,692
[SPEAKER_02]: On one hand, I have almost four-year-old hardware, but on the other, I have...

2268
02:58:39,965 --> 02:58:43,728
[SPEAKER_02]: No games that I'm looking forward to to justify it.

2269
02:58:44,328 --> 02:58:47,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not talking about Modern Warfare 3 because that's a non-starter.

2270
02:58:48,211 --> 02:58:51,353
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is like, I'm not going to jump on that hype bandwagon.

2271
02:58:51,373 --> 02:58:52,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I was banking on Battlefield 3.

2272
02:58:53,935 --> 02:58:58,819
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they pull out some bullshit copy protection stuff, that's going to turn me off.

2273
02:59:00,060 --> 02:59:04,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be like Steam where even though there is copy protection, it doesn't feel like it.

2274
02:59:05,299 --> 02:59:06,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It's oblivious to the user.

2275
02:59:07,381 --> 02:59:08,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how it should be.

2276
02:59:08,361 --> 02:59:09,522
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be non-intrusive.

2277
02:59:09,863 --> 02:59:10,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Agree, agree.

2278
02:59:12,104 --> 02:59:22,152
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't know how Origin's going to play out because it used to be known as Download Manager and even then they still had plenty of copy protection on the games they sold through that one.

2279
02:59:22,412 --> 02:59:31,276
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, one reason, I truly think... Hold on, Zaku.

2280
02:59:32,116 --> 02:59:40,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Zaku, I really think that the reason people are all over Steam doesn't even have to necessarily do with its interface and all of that.

2281
02:59:40,540 --> 02:59:43,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's honestly the crazy fucking deals they have on there.

2282
02:59:43,481 --> 02:59:46,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anybody would have given Steam a second look otherwise.

2283
02:59:46,403 --> 02:59:47,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would have been about as popular as X-Fire.

2284
02:59:47,723 --> 02:59:50,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, that may be true because they can, like, you know, these...

2285
02:59:52,205 --> 02:59:52,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Saku, Saku, Saku

2286
03:00:06,797 --> 03:00:12,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, faintly, I think I've seen him in certain episodes from time to time.

2287
03:00:12,422 --> 03:00:15,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing, no, no, it's not a user, it's an actual program.

2288
03:00:15,485 --> 03:00:21,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think MTV Games bought them, thinking it was going to be the next big thing.

2289
03:00:21,510 --> 03:00:30,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Steam blew that program out of the fucking water, because what they did is they took a lot of the things that X-Fire brought to the table and built a store around it that had...

2290
03:00:31,198 --> 03:00:33,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Killer Deals, and now every-

2291
03:00:52,910 --> 03:00:56,312
[SPEAKER_05]: My point is, Steam didn't really bring anything new to the table.

2292
03:00:56,712 --> 03:00:57,493
[SPEAKER_05]: It just made it.

2293
03:00:57,573 --> 03:00:58,814
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Apple.

2294
03:00:58,874 --> 03:01:01,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it brought it to the table extremely well.

2295
03:01:01,595 --> 03:01:03,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like a lot of Microsoft products.

2296
03:01:03,837 --> 03:01:04,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the Xbox.

2297
03:01:05,958 --> 03:01:12,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's more like Apple taking something that already exists but marketing it well to the point where they make money.

2298
03:01:12,562 --> 03:01:13,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Steam did.

2299
03:01:13,743 --> 03:01:15,704
[SPEAKER_02]: They know how to market something like this.

2300
03:01:15,724 --> 03:01:17,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that gamers would want to go after.

2301
03:01:17,946 --> 03:01:18,526
[SPEAKER_05]: My point.

2302
03:01:18,686 --> 03:01:19,667
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2303
03:01:34,184 --> 03:01:40,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the way I see it is that, to them, Origin is something that's completely out of place to their norms.

2304
03:01:41,547 --> 03:01:42,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Case in point, Steam.

2305
03:01:42,808 --> 03:01:44,449
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that they feel comfortable with.

2306
03:01:44,909 --> 03:01:52,012
[SPEAKER_02]: If you throw in Origin, it's something that hasn't been proven, and it's not tried and true yet, and it's something that EA's still working on.

2307
03:01:52,032 --> 03:02:00,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still in its infancy, so it's the uncertainty that Origin brings to these guys, to these people that are hesitant about it.

2308
03:02:00,936 --> 03:02:05,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's causing the rift and backlash, you know, in my honest opinion.

2309
03:02:06,238 --> 03:02:15,702
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I know Battlefield 3 will be an awesome game, but the way that the distribution is like, that plays an integral role in the fact that it can make or break their sales.

2310
03:02:16,242 --> 03:02:22,425
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want somebody downloading a lemon, which is going to be useless if it's locked down pretty tight.

2311
03:02:22,565 --> 03:02:22,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2312
03:02:23,605 --> 03:02:26,168
[SPEAKER_02]: to the point where only pirates will have the best experience.

2313
03:02:26,188 --> 03:02:26,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I agree.

2314
03:02:27,088 --> 03:02:31,933
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about Origin is that the first copy protection or whatever type of mistake they make will kill them.

2315
03:02:32,313 --> 03:02:39,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the interesting thing about new technologies is that the first mistake, if they make it early on, will murder them.

2316
03:02:39,860 --> 03:02:41,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Case in point, Google Buzz.

2317
03:02:41,742 --> 03:02:45,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Google Buzz was murdered by what they did with the privacy thing.

2318
03:02:45,565 --> 03:02:47,287
[SPEAKER_02]: They're toast if they screw up

2319
03:02:47,967 --> 03:02:55,774
[SPEAKER_02]: If they screw up to the point where it reaffirms that Steam is the only choice, then that's it.

2320
03:02:56,374 --> 03:03:02,759
[SPEAKER_02]: EA basically has a walking dead man right there in Origin.

2321
03:03:04,461 --> 03:03:13,428
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that Origin can not only be on par, if not maybe outdo Steam, is try to bring something that hasn't been...

2322
03:03:14,451 --> 03:03:23,202
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, first of all, they have to, like, one, make sure that the copy protection is, like, not oblivious and more importantly, not obstructive.

2323
03:03:24,267 --> 03:03:32,112
[SPEAKER_02]: The second point is they have to do something unique that differentiates themselves from Steam.

2324
03:03:32,933 --> 03:03:34,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Aside from what Steam has already done.

2325
03:03:34,694 --> 03:03:37,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty certain that they're going to have all the social aspects.

2326
03:03:37,276 --> 03:03:40,398
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to show me what is worth leaving Steam for.

2327
03:03:40,618 --> 03:03:49,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they can't produce killer fucking deals that convince me to drop $40 on a bunch of games I'll probably end up only playing once, then I'm not so sure they're going to come out ahead.

2328
03:03:49,644 --> 03:03:53,226
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to have a contingency plan of origin for some reason.

2329
03:03:54,587 --> 03:03:57,009
[SPEAKER_02]: fails, what happens to their digital content?

2330
03:03:57,049 --> 03:03:59,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they're right back where they were a year ago.

2331
03:04:00,211 --> 03:04:02,053
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be fine.

2332
03:04:02,113 --> 03:04:02,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.

2333
03:04:02,633 --> 03:04:04,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about right now, but more long term.

2334
03:04:05,475 --> 03:04:08,077
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to have some sort of contingency plan in place.

2335
03:04:08,137 --> 03:04:15,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty certain Valve has something in place should Steam ever fail and they would have to wind down.

2336
03:04:16,143 --> 03:04:22,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're going to see a lot of pissed off people where their digital content is not worth jack and they can't hold on to it.

2337
03:04:23,322 --> 03:04:31,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, the content is only as good as the service that's backing it up, that enables you to actually play it.

2338
03:04:31,869 --> 03:04:36,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go, but before I let you go, I am getting a request from chat.

2339
03:04:38,394 --> 03:04:45,879
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

2340
03:04:48,581 --> 03:04:50,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Zaku, thanks for your call.

2341
03:04:52,184 --> 03:04:52,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2342
03:04:52,785 --> 03:04:53,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Nian,

2343
03:04:56,744 --> 03:05:05,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio What do you think about EA versus Steam and all this stuff?

2344
03:05:05,909 --> 03:05:12,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Let us know Meanwhile, do we have more last minute stories or did you burn them all?

2345
03:05:14,733 --> 03:05:23,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I burned them all Good job, Loki They burned on a fire Good job Alright, so are we ready to announce what you're working on over there or do you need more time?

2346
03:05:25,379 --> 03:05:34,290
[SPEAKER_05]: It did come to my attention that OLR does try to be on the cutting edge of a bunch of social eds, but there was one that we've all been using that we're not using at OLR yet.

2347
03:05:34,310 --> 03:05:37,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go ahead and tell everybody, but I'm still working on the theme.

2348
03:05:38,174 --> 03:05:39,055
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a Tumblr now.

2349
03:05:39,856 --> 03:05:40,737
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be stuff on it.

2350
03:05:40,797 --> 03:05:41,398
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hipster.

2351
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:44,701
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll post it with lots of pictures from Reddit.

2352
03:05:45,402 --> 03:05:47,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Tumblr is a really easy way to cross-post stuff.

2353
03:05:48,104 --> 03:05:51,226
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the ultimate photo blog.

2354
03:05:51,306 --> 03:05:53,687
[SPEAKER_05]: It's MAME central.

2355
03:05:53,747 --> 03:05:56,129
[SPEAKER_05]: When somebody sees something funny, they just post it to their Tumblr.

2356
03:05:56,209 --> 03:05:56,649
[SPEAKER_05]: No words.

2357
03:05:56,809 --> 03:05:58,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can post words, like quotes and things.

2358
03:05:59,131 --> 03:06:00,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Just pictures and stuff.

2359
03:06:00,592 --> 03:06:02,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And videos, but you can actually use it as a regular blog.

2360
03:06:03,093 --> 03:06:04,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, some people will want to follow that.

2361
03:06:04,914 --> 03:06:05,535
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

2362
03:06:06,175 --> 03:06:07,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go to the phones and take another call.

2363
03:06:07,576 --> 03:06:08,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2364
03:06:08,416 --> 03:06:08,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2365
03:06:09,237 --> 03:06:10,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, it's Ranma.

2366
03:06:10,257 --> 03:06:10,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, what's up, buddy?

2367
03:06:11,690 --> 03:06:12,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much.

2368
03:06:12,331 --> 03:06:14,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have some interesting news to tell.

2369
03:06:14,753 --> 03:06:15,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy.

2370
03:06:16,135 --> 03:06:17,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, you'll like it.

2371
03:06:19,038 --> 03:06:20,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I am getting a PlayStation 3.

2372
03:06:22,021 --> 03:06:22,622
Yes!

2373
03:06:23,022 --> 03:06:23,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you getting a PlayStation 3?

2374
03:06:25,563 --> 03:06:26,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

2375
03:06:43,985 --> 03:06:46,426
[SPEAKER_04]: First Ends are better anyways because they have full backwards compatibility.

2376
03:06:47,627 --> 03:06:50,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I use mine to the fullest by not playing any PlayStation 2 games.

2377
03:06:50,708 --> 03:06:57,392
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I wish... You know, I know there's some people that would look at me and go, why don't you just get a PS2 if you want to play PS2 games?

2378
03:06:57,432 --> 03:07:05,836
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can't tell you, having owned all the fucking consoles I do, I can't tell you how fucking convenient it is to have multiple in one box.

2379
03:07:06,256 --> 03:07:12,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I really wish I lived in a world where the Wii, the 360, and the PlayStation 3 were just one fucking console.

2380
03:07:12,539 --> 03:07:12,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Like...

2381
03:07:14,280 --> 03:07:14,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I

2382
03:07:43,476 --> 03:07:44,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan!

2383
03:07:45,097 --> 03:07:45,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Explanation!

2384
03:07:46,177 --> 03:07:47,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he says it's coming to DVD too.

2385
03:07:48,919 --> 03:07:49,999
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also on DVD.

2386
03:07:51,480 --> 03:08:00,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the fact that I heard that first, I'm like, well, for me, if that's not a reason to get a PS3, I don't know what is since most of my games are in a 360, but my question is this.

2387
03:08:00,645 --> 03:08:02,926
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play Demon's Souls and LittleBigPlanet.

2388
03:08:02,986 --> 03:08:03,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, LittleBigPlanet.

2389
03:08:03,706 --> 03:08:04,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Dan is correct.

2390
03:08:04,647 --> 03:08:06,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I just double-checked on Amazon.

2391
03:08:07,668 --> 03:08:08,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Both are available.

2392
03:08:09,249 --> 03:08:12,091
[SPEAKER_05]: You were lied to by a lying liar.

2393
03:08:13,044 --> 03:08:38,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I will pistol whip her later alright with love any other thoughts Ranma before I let you go I want to know what game should I get for my PS3 I want to pick from all three of you you absolutely need LittleBigPlanet absolutely the must have game on Playstation 3 DarkSakura Dance is Infamous Loki

2394
03:08:39,338 --> 03:08:41,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I would do Resistance.

2395
03:08:41,259 --> 03:08:45,482
[SPEAKER_04]: You can probably pick up, they have the Resistance dual pack now with 1 and 2 in there.

2396
03:08:45,522 --> 03:08:47,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pick that up and it's a good time.

2397
03:08:48,424 --> 03:08:48,845
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2398
03:08:49,665 --> 03:08:50,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Works for me.

2399
03:08:50,766 --> 03:08:54,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well have fun with your PS3 and add me, K. I will, dude.

2400
03:08:54,909 --> 03:08:55,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2401
03:08:56,150 --> 03:08:58,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2402
03:08:58,572 --> 03:09:00,673
[SPEAKER_05]: 1877 GameOLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2403
03:09:00,773 --> 03:09:02,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we can fit in one more call.

2404
03:09:02,274 --> 03:09:03,415
[SPEAKER_05]: One quick little call.

2405
03:09:04,474 --> 03:09:08,557
[SPEAKER_04]: See, it does suck because I do have to still pick up Infamous, or not Infamous, Resistance.

2406
03:09:08,917 --> 03:09:10,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I have Infamous now.

2407
03:09:10,098 --> 03:09:15,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I download, or I have the download mark for my PS3 from Welcome Back, and I have number two.

2408
03:09:15,602 --> 03:09:19,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I'm probably going to sell number two because I don't know if I'll really get into the series.

2409
03:09:20,885 --> 03:09:23,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Randy in our chatroom says, quick, back out of the purchase, Ranma.

2410
03:09:23,727 --> 03:09:25,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, back out so I can buy it.

2411
03:09:28,109 --> 03:09:31,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that would be a waste of money because I really do have a PS2 already and all that good stuff.

2412
03:09:31,490 --> 03:09:33,011
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I guess we've got time for one more call.

2413
03:09:33,031 --> 03:09:33,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take this.

2414
03:09:33,511 --> 03:09:34,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2415
03:09:34,431 --> 03:09:34,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2416
03:09:35,992 --> 03:09:37,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

2417
03:09:37,233 --> 03:09:37,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Spazinator.

2418
03:09:37,873 --> 03:09:38,333
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, buddy?

2419
03:09:40,474 --> 03:09:42,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, two things.

2420
03:09:43,435 --> 03:09:54,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Just in reference to the last call that you just had, if I were to recommend any games for the PS3...

2421
03:09:57,299 --> 03:09:59,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Siphon LittleBigPlanet, which you already mentioned.

2422
03:10:00,482 --> 03:10:05,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I would probably go with the Resistance games.

2423
03:10:07,268 --> 03:10:09,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Those would be good.

2424
03:10:10,190 --> 03:10:11,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say this, though, real fast.

2425
03:10:11,651 --> 03:10:20,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma, if you have the money, just do LittleBigPlanet 2, because all the old LittleBigPlanet levels, you can play in LittleBigPlanet 2, meaning the created levels online, just so you know.

2426
03:10:21,755 --> 03:10:22,796
[SPEAKER_09]: What else?

2427
03:10:23,897 --> 03:10:30,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to say it, because you guys know I've been a really big supporter of PlayStation 3 and all that.

2428
03:10:30,924 --> 03:10:37,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, and you're that abused significant other that keeps coming back.

2429
03:10:39,613 --> 03:10:43,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm practically Sony's red-headed stepchild right now.

2430
03:10:43,577 --> 03:10:45,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

2431
03:10:46,900 --> 03:10:53,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Since March of last year, I have had three PlayStation 3s get the yellow light of death.

2432
03:10:53,385 --> 03:11:04,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, honestly, if it weren't for the fact that I got so much money invested in the system, in terms of downloadable games and, of course, the videos,

2433
03:11:07,079 --> 03:11:08,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to ask this though, Spazinator.

2434
03:11:08,460 --> 03:11:12,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything you think there might be about how you use your PlayStation 3?

2435
03:11:13,064 --> 03:11:13,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to ask it.

2436
03:11:14,065 --> 03:11:15,046
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be contributing.

2437
03:11:15,506 --> 03:11:17,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you leave it in a poorly ventilated place?

2438
03:11:17,908 --> 03:11:22,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you use the thing so much that it just can't handle it?

2439
03:11:22,772 --> 03:11:23,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it on all day?

2440
03:11:24,313 --> 03:11:24,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2441
03:11:24,593 --> 03:11:25,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think.

2442
03:11:25,634 --> 03:11:27,275
[SPEAKER_05]: What could be your luck?

2443
03:11:27,295 --> 03:11:30,338
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing I could come up with

2444
03:11:30,868 --> 03:11:43,433
[SPEAKER_09]: that could possibly factor into it is that my entire building as a whole is practically hotter than a hemorrhoid on Satan's ass during the summertime.

2445
03:11:44,033 --> 03:11:54,977
[SPEAKER_09]: At least in terms of my particular place, I store my system, normally try to keep it

2446
03:11:56,050 --> 03:12:01,775
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, ventilated, you know, at least 10 inches on each side, you know, for ventilation and all that.

2447
03:12:01,835 --> 03:12:06,619
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, during the summertime, the building just gets hot, you know.

2448
03:12:06,959 --> 03:12:21,832
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, that can't totally factor into it because, you know, because, you know, my system, you know, I got the old wire down twice last spring and my building doesn't even get hot.

2449
03:12:22,555 --> 03:12:23,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Hot during the spring.

2450
03:12:23,576 --> 03:12:26,298
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, it's practically freezing cold during the spring.

2451
03:12:26,318 --> 03:12:30,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me ask this because this is the question that the chatters are dying to know the answer to.

2452
03:12:30,761 --> 03:12:32,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you breaking up with Sony?

2453
03:12:32,322 --> 03:12:32,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this it?

2454
03:12:33,082 --> 03:12:37,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you saying, Sony, I want to see someone else and her name is Microsoft?

2455
03:12:39,787 --> 03:12:41,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm severely tempted to.

2456
03:12:41,568 --> 03:12:49,434
[SPEAKER_09]: The only reason I'm even constantly having my system fixed is like I was starting to see like a minute ago is that

2457
03:12:50,117 --> 03:13:05,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I have so much money invested in downloadable games, the DLC, and the videos, I just hate to see myself lose access to that stuff that I already bought or got for free up until now.

2458
03:13:07,027 --> 03:13:12,651
[SPEAKER_09]: At least for a time being, if I do get it fixed, I've been playing my...

2459
03:13:14,306 --> 03:13:20,551
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, 360 lot along with WoW since I just started WoW like a week or two ago.

2460
03:13:20,691 --> 03:13:25,815
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, it just kills me that the system just died.

2461
03:13:25,835 --> 03:13:31,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, now, what little money I have coming soon was already earmarked for something else.

2462
03:13:32,640 --> 03:13:39,985
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I'm going to have to scrounge up money to get my system fixed and rearrange my plans and stuff like that.

2463
03:13:40,025 --> 03:13:42,707
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's a pain in the ear to watch.

2464
03:13:42,787 --> 03:13:43,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.

2465
03:13:44,474 --> 03:13:48,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, keep us posted on what happens in this ongoing saga.

2466
03:13:49,018 --> 03:13:50,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, good luck.

2467
03:13:51,800 --> 03:13:53,661
