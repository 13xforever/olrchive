Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Who's the host?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, July 10th, 2011

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Is the Playstation 4 release set to start production soon?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The PSP says goodbye to comics

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and Nintendo faces a lawsuit over the 3DS

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello everybody on the internet

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and welcome back to the show where every gamer has a voice

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Orange Lounge Radio

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are live on this July 10th, 2011

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
for the 419th episode of our show

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want cake

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Get in line

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I had ice cream cake yesterday, it was delish

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So did I

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I know

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And it had princesses on it

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes, Salacious Pop had a birthday yesterday

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and mine was a couple of weeks ago as you might recall

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
but we did like a joint birthday thing

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
more closer to his birthday, I'm sorry

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
His birthday was two days ago but the party was yesterday

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and so we had a joint cake

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's one of our friends' bot and it's one of those snarky friends

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that's, you know, funny, bitchy funny

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and got a cake that said Happy Birthday Princesses with the two Mickey and Minnie Mouse on it

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But it was cute and I ate some of the sand part

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And I was just very happy because we just didn't want chocolate

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
because you might remember on OLR a few weeks ago

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I got a chocolate cake, which was great, I loved it, don't get me wrong

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Then I went to work, and I had a chocolate cake at work from co-workers

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and I'm like, oh yay, more chocolate

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But I bet Becky's cake was better

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Becky's cake was better because hers

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
you could tell the difference between homemade and store-bought

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So I mean, I appreciated the cake at work, don't get me wrong

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But, you know, I think the Becky cake was a little more from the heart

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
if you will, rather than from the grocery store

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Anyhow, let's go over to the third co-host on our show

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
here with us as he's been every single week since episode one

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
with few minor exceptions like when kids are born

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Loki!

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hi

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hi, how are you tonight, Loki?

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm a little sick, but I'm alright

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You're sick? You better not get me sick, I'm gonna kick your butt

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hey, I've been doing everything possible not to get anybody else sick

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm gonna wash my hands like crazy, and that's pretty much it

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's okay, I've got a bucket of Lysol I could dump on him

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You might need to do that, because I really can't get sick

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Speaking of work, I have a lot going on at work, I cannot get sick

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's not bad, it's just congestion, that's it

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not like I'm throwing up or something

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's just like, it could very well be allergies, but it's not

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And it all started with one damn sneeze

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I sneezed, and then all of a sudden I'm like, ugh, and I'm sick

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's like an avalanche

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's like sneeze plague

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's like when my nose started feeling like burning after that

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm like, ugh, I hate you

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, I had this weird thing going on where the top of my throat was getting all scratchy

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
a couple weeks ago, or no, not a couple weeks ago, it was more like last week

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and I was like, oh crap, this is me starting to get sick

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I started taking the emergency and the other vitamins, like loading my body with sea and zinc

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
just to try and fend it off, and I guess it worked

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Shooting up with steroids

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I didn't go that far, come on, I'm not Arnold Schwarzenegger

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Anyhow, let's talk about video games as we get into another week here at OLR

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
where we talk about the gaming news, invite you guys to call us

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and of course join us in chat at chat.orangelandrader.com

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Speaking of the chat

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What's that?

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I asked Azure Edge, who said, I love bronies

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is that like brownies for bros?

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Is that the My Little Brony thing that we were talking about a couple weeks ago?

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Maybe

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I think there's a phantom W in that

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Unless bronies are actually like

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That would be brow-nies

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Brownies with bacon inside of them, you know, brownies with bacon, those would be bronies

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A couple of my friends, they're actually sisters, they make bacon brownies

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We are very much considering a pork party for Josh's first birthday

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm serious, it's looking like it's probably going to happen

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Tarak Sakri, you could protest, you could stand outside with your PETA sign

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Fuck PETA

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Here's some other fun random things real quick

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
One of the other runner-up ideas for a party

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and we're probably thinking about this for maybe second or third year

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and you're going to laugh, pedo bear themed

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why would you do that for your child?

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Because it's funny, because our friends would know what it is, but our family doesn't know what pedo bear is

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They think it's just a teddy bear, it would be hilarious

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you going to get a bounce house and everything?

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Maybe

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You should get the Pikachu bounce house where you climb into Pikachu's butt

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I think Dark Sakura should dress up as pedo bear

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I said internet meme themed party

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
because we were trying to think of something that's not been done before

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Pork party I think is pretty

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You should do a troll party and make everyone wear troll masks

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I was going to say, if you do an internet meme party, I will come as Nyan Cat

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I will have little rainbow streamers behind me, I'll wear a pop tart

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I think that would be funny, but maybe not this year

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The only reason she was thinking of doing pork party

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I guess some of her Facebook, like mommy friends or whatever

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
One of them makes cakes, and they said

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh I can make a pig cake with an apple in its mouth

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And the apple would be its own personal little cake for Josh

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Little known fact about me, my uncle is actually a pig farmer

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They have a ranch out in the not so city part of Sacramento

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Like out in the valley a little more

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They actually have a little ranch out there where they raise pigs to be sold for food basically

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
For all those pickled pigs feet

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And it's kind of sick because we used to go there for Easter and Christmas and all the holidays

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And I was younger, and man we would just have a feast of bacon and all that stuff

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And it didn't really hit me until much later in life

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh god, it was kind of

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Sad

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm gonna take some bacon outside for the pigs

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We used to go out to the barn and look at the baby pigs

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It was like, oh it's cute the baby pigs

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And we'd come in and just feast on ham

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And now I'm realizing like, god that was kind of messed up

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Ham, okay even when I did eat pork

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Ham has always been so disgusting to me

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It just tastes like, not right

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay I promise we'll get into video games here in a minute

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But I have to say about like ham

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I gotta say I am a ham person

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I like the honey baked hams, those are my favorite

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But for Thanksgiving, I really don't like turkey

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I am not a turkey person

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I always get my own drumstick

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
My mother's very kind in that she always makes a ham

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Which is funny because I have two brothers

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And we would always fight over them

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So I'd just say fine, neither of you can have them

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'd wrap them up and put it in the fridge

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Alright, video games, quickly before we get into gaming weeks

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I want to do a quick follow up to a story from last week

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's not on the show roll anywhere

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf who of course

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
As he has been for many many many many weeks

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is on before us as we do tape live every Sunday night at allgames.com

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Right after Bobby's show

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
One of the things he was talking about on his 300th episode

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Grats on the ding by the way

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He was talking about the whole update to the Nintendo games

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Supposedly, as we reported on last week or the week before

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Are not coming to the US

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because Nintendo just has no interest in those games at that time

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There's this whole Operation Rainfall

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's trying to get the games localized

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Well apparently there's some mole within Nintendo

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That reported to Operation Rainfall that

161
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, these games are coming

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's just a very hush thing right now

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Which leads me to believe that

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You hit the nail on the head last week, Loki

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
When Reggie's gonna come out

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It may not be in XD3, it could be like the holiday

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It'll be in XD3

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You think all the way to XD3?

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think it's XD3 because localization doesn't take that long

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And because they want to have something saying

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Hey, you know, we haven't forgotten about you

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Because the whole point is they're gonna try to

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let the hardcore gamers know

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We haven't forgotten about you

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's why you need to buy our new system

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So, I mean, granted, those are Wii games

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But they still play on the new Wii U system

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But that's kind of the whole theme

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
They're gonna be trying

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because they need that hardcore crowd

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because the casual gamer doesn't give a shit about their new system

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I mean, eventually they will because of the touchscreen thing

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But it's gonna be convincing these people

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That really bought the system for Wii Sports

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And Wii Sports Resort and maybe Mario Kart or something like that

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Why they need to go out and buy another system

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, I mean, Nintendo doesn't just have to have

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
One press conference a year, though

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't see anything stopping Nintendo from

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Thinking again what you said last week about

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
They'll come out and say

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Except you said it a lot more angry

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You know, the fans demanded it and here it is

194
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You know, there's no reason they couldn't do this big thing

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
At Nintendo World in New York City

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Where they'll have a big press conference

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And invite people to play the games in for the first time

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Because it's what you the gamer wanted

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And we listened because we're the company that

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Loves our fans

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They're just

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I mean, I don't know

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They could have easily phrased it away without

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Because what's the point in saying, you know

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why even say

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
No, it's not something that we're working on right now

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Here's an important point from Dark Tetsuya

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
In our chatroom at chat.orangesonsready.com

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
C goes back to when they said

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Not at this time

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Is it possible that the intern that updates Facebook

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Perhaps just, you know, had to say something

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But realized they couldn't exactly

214
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Spoil an upcoming press conference

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, they don't have to say anything

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And if it is E3

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Why do they even have to say anything

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I mean, let's put it this way

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They went out during E3

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And said, hey, we're gonna work on a Smash Bros game

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I mean, we haven't started working on a Smash Bros game yet

222
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But we will eventually work on

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I mean, if they're gonna announce stuff

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That we will eventually work on

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Versus something that they maybe

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Just started working on or something that they're planning on

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why can't they say, hey, you know what fans

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're right, we are gonna be

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Bringing these games over to

230
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
North America, stay tuned for more information

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's all they had to do

232
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
People wouldn't have been pissed

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They could still announce all their stuff at, you know, E3

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And say, hey, you know what, we heard you guys

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Without looking like complete assholes

236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
At the same time

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But no, they decided, hey, we're just gonna say

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No, we don't have any plans to do that

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And then everyone gets pissed off at them

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I kinda think the intern just did what they had to do

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And, you know

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, then they should come out

243
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They have an opportunity to update at any time

244
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hey, you know what, word is actually

245
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We are gonna be bringing these over

246
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You know, stay tuned for more details

247
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Now, here's a thought from

248
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Black Wolf, who's in our chat room

249
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And I actually think this is a great idea

250
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
How about PAX?

251
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Reggie comes out at PAX and says, here's your game, bitches

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And Breakman follows that up with

253
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Then he bitch slaps everyone

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But are they doing any

255
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Sort of press conference at PAX?

256
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
PAX doesn't usually have press conferences

257
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But PAX, they will probably have a presence

258
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
On the show floor, usually the Washington

259
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Cause PAX is up in Seattle

260
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
At the time anyway

261
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And they're right in the backyard of Microsoft and Nintendo

262
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So there's no reason

263
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I remember the one year we all went to PAX

264
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I believe that had been the first time that

265
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Animal Crossing was shown out on the floor

266
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't think it had made E3 that year

267
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
My memory is a little bit fuzzy

268
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But I seem to remember there was something on the floor that year

269
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That actually was new for Nintendo

270
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That they had not shown at E3

271
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And PAX being the whole fan service

272
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Expo, and you know

273
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Delivering what the fans want

274
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Would actually seem like

275
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The perfect idea

276
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I think that's a great idea from Bobby

277
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The only thing that I think

278
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Might be a little bit, maybe not

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Is that it's a little soon

280
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But it could also kind of add up to this bigger equation

281
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That maybe Nintendo wanted to make

282
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
E3 all about

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You know, these games

284
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And they want to make PAX about the other stuff

285
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It sounds like PAX would make more sense because

286
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If they're localizing this stuff for Europe already

287
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Localizing it for the United States

288
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
North America is

289
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I mean, they've already done all the voice and

290
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Translation work

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't think that they really need to do anything

292
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I think all they have to worry about is the NTSC versus PAL

293
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's the stuff they have to worry about

294
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Not just rendering, I mean that

295
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
High def, it doesn't matter anyways

296
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Or 480p

297
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's the Wii

298
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It doesn't matter, okay, let me put it this way

299
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Your Wii will interpret it any way

300
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It doesn't matter

301
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know

302
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
They could have done it in a more

303
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You know

304
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Polite way without ruining any surprises

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I mean, they could just say, stay tuned for more details

306
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And they'll be like, oh, here it is

307
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It just wouldn't surprise me if there's that whole

308
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Corporate, you know, like

309
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We make the plan in January

310
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Of 2011 for

311
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Here's the marketing for the entire year

312
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And we're going to announce this game

313
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
At this expo and this, and we have a tight calendar

314
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Of who's going to what expo to show, what game

315
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You know, this stuff is just mapped out a year in advance

316
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And the interns know

317
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That update Facebook, I better stick to

318
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The schedule, you know, I can't

319
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Or they may not even know themselves

320
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But as we're going to get into more information

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's not true

322
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We know that's not true, they've come out and said that

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's not true because of certain factors that play into

324
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Certain things

325
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And you can't just stick to a strict schedule

326
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Anyways, because you don't know what's going to happen

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I guess that's true

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And if you have a bunch of people that are rabid fans over something

329
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And you are planning on doing this

330
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
With a bone or something like that to keep them interested

331
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So they're not thinking, oh well, Nintendo's abandoned

332
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Me, you know, well screw them

333
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm going to move on

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And, I mean

335
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't know

336
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Alright, let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about

337
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The video games we have been playing this week

338
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The stuff that has been released in America

339
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Unless you guys are playing import games this week

340
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Which is certainly possible

341
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

342
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It was a little more eventful

343
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I played that game that you sent me

344
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Terrarium

345
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Terraria I think

346
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's pretty

347
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's pretty fun so far

348
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But it's still Horizontal Minecraft

349
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I dug a lot of holes

350
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And died a lot

351
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And popped slimes with pickaxe

352
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I played some WoW

353
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
One

354
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Item level

355
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Stupid Firelands

356
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What else did I do?

357
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I played Portal 2

358
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Some more today

359
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And I played Droplets the other night

360
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What do you do in Portal 2

361
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
On all your replays

362
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Are you going through for achievements

363
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Or are you just trying to get your speed better

364
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I've done all of the single player achievements

365
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Except for one of the speed levels

366
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But mostly I just go through

367
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Because it's fun

368
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I just keep playing it

369
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I like watching your favorite movie

370
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I played

371
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Some Doom 2

372
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's kind of random

373
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah it's not

374
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
As good as I remember

375
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But it's still fun

376
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I still remember a lot of my cheats

377
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
IDGAF

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
IDGAF

379
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
IDKFA

380
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You know

381
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I just remember in Doom

382
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
When you could make the screen

383
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You could adjust the screen size

384
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
To get your computer to render it better

385
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
For older systems

386
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
My 386 or my 486 100

387
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't even remember it so long ago

388
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I had to put the window at the minimum size

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
To get it to run decently

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It was this little tiny window on my screen

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's like trying to play a Game Boy

392
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
On my computer screen

393
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I just always remember liking the

394
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Names of the levels like Hurt Me Plenty

395
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And all that

396
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That was my favorite one

397
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I found out that I can't play Hexen anymore

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I really can't

399
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Which is the motion sickness of the first person

400
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
No it's just not great anymore

401
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Aww how sad

402
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I know but I still remember my codes for that too

403
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Like God Mode was Satan

404
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And NRA

405
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Was all weapons

406
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Are you picking up these games

407
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
For Steam sale?

408
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Well I already had Hexen

409
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But I picked up the Doom Pack

410
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm so mad I missed that

411
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The Doom Pack was 8 bucks

412
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I missed the Quake Pack when it was on sale

413
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah it's probably still a good deal

414
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
At 20 bucks but there's just something about the whole

415
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You're getting it at a really good deal

416
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Steam sales are so dangerous

417
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm telling you when we get to my gaming week

418
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I wish I put out all the sim stuff cheap

419
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Just wait Rob

420
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sure it'll go on sale again once Rage comes out

421
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh it will I'm sure

422
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll wait for the sale

423
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I have plenty to hold me over

424
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
For months

425
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Anyhow Dark Soccer

426
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Well I tried to play DAC again

427
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I check DAC

428
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And I always keep forgetting that I need a controller to play it

429
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So I'm like

430
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Just grab one of the Xbox controllers one day

431
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
There you go

432
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Alright

433
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Loki! How was your gaming week?

434
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I didn't play a whole lot

435
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It was mainly just Grand Theft Auto this week

436
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Rockstar Games decided to finally

437
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
After I don't know how many years

438
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well a couple years now

439
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
To patch the mods again for Grand Theft Auto

440
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Now they didn't patch everything

441
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
They patched it kind of like the way they did with 4wares

442
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Mainly everything that

443
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I mean most of the things that you could use

444
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I guess to grief other players

445
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Like they patched all the weapon mods

446
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And

447
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Some other random stuff which is kind of lame

448
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But I still can do like vehicle mods

449
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
If we wanted to and the map mods

450
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Which is kind of cool because I'm still working on something for that

451
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So

452
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We went back to playing regular

453
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Ballad of Gay Tony Deathmatch

454
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Again and I'm trying to work my way

455
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Up the leaderboards again

456
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Since I haven't played in a while

457
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And a lot more people are playing my ranks drop

458
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Pretty significantly but

459
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Still you know

460
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Out of like 200,000

461
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Plus players you know being like

462
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
85 is not bad

463
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So

464
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You know just still working on getting

465
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Up there

466
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I was at one point trying to beat this

467
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Player named Chuck Norris just because it would be funny

468
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Because you know you have to defeat Chuck Norris

469
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But now he's gone so

470
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Chevy Chase

471
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm after you

472
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
A little bit of Earth Defense Force

473
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And

474
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That was pretty much it this week really didn't play a whole lot

475
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Alright

476
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
My gaming week

477
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's see I

478
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I found that Steam sale

479
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
To be very dangerous that whole thing that they're doing

480
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This week and I have easily dropped

481
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
40 to 50 dollars

482
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
On games which is exactly what they want

483
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
People to do that's the whole trick behind it

484
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Man I got to say I picked up a lot of good stuff

485
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So here's some of the stuff I've played this week

486
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
One of my favorites

487
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And it's one of those things where I've known

488
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
About this game for the longest time and I hear

489
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Good things about it and I just for whatever

490
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Reason have never played it I'm just

491
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Too busy playing WoW or something on the

492
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Xbox or what have you and I always

493
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Neglect to look at this game but I finally picked up

494
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Beat Hazard which is

495
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
A game that's available on Steam and it's on sale

496
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
There's this whole combo pack going on

497
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Right now where it's Beat Hazard, Ultra

498
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And all this other stuff

499
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Basically in a nutshell imagine if

500
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Like Geometry Wars

501
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Kind of met a game where you

502
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Could put your own music

503
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
In and then add

504
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Super seizure robots to the whole thing

505
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's what Beat Hazard is

506
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Look I usually

507
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Am not the photo sensitive type and

508
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You know I don't usually have reactions

509
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
To video games but I got to say in playing

510
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Beat Hazard I seriously think

511
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I felt a little odd playing

512
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It like I was like you know I'm not usually

513
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Prone to this type of stuff but this game is gonna

514
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Do it like if any game is gonna set me

515
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Off and cause me to have a seizure it's probably

516
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Gonna be this game

517
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
If you haven't played the game you know

518
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're this little ship and the way it controls

519
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Is kind of interesting on the computer because

520
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You use your mouse to target

521
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Things and use the button to shoot

522
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
On your mouse but you use WASD

523
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
To move your ship so it's kind of a neat

524
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Little control system you know it takes the place

525
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Of two thumb sticks which you know I'm sure

526
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You would use if I plugged in a controller but I

527
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Kind of like the whole WASD and using

528
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Your mouse to shoot and

529
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Basically you can load your own

530
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
MP3's or iTunes songs

531
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Or you can use like the 20 some

532
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Odd songs that are just a part of the game by

533
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Default all kind of techno

534
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Trancy Ravey songs or

535
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You can play the Lady Gaga songs like I did which is

536
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Actually a lot of fun and the

537
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Ships kind of

538
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I guess are generated based on the music

539
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But the speed is kind of

540
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Driven by the music and most

541
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Importantly kind of the pulse

542
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Of the bullets and the background

543
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And everything is driven by the beats of the game

544
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And a lot of your power ups are based around

545
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Volume you can the

546
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Basically the more powerful you are the louder

547
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The song gets which is kind of cool

548
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So yeah you know for

549
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
About I think I paid about

550
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Like six bucks for the whole thing I don't

551
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It was a pretty good deal so

552
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Very happy with that

553
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Some of the other games I've bought

554
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
During this sale

555
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Arkon I had no

556
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Idea that the classic 80's

557
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Commodore 64 slash

558
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
NES game Arkon was

559
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Now on PC until

560
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I

561
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Believe it was Travis

562
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
From under sedation live

563
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Mentioned it to me on Twitter that

564
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Arkon was available on the iPhone

565
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And I was like oh snap there's like this

566
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Whole iPhone game out there and it kind of had me thinking

567
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
If they've done it for the iPhone I wonder if there's a new

568
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
PC version so I searched for Arkon

569
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Arkon on Steam and sure enough

570
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
A brand new Arkon game has been released

571
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And I'm like just mind blown

572
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
How long has this game been out

573
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And I didn't even know about it and I used to love this game

574
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Back in the day so I bought the new one and I haven't

575
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Played enough of it yet where I could really tell you a lot

576
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
About it but I will say

577
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I played through at least the tutorial mode

578
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And it's definitely the old school Arkon

579
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm just hoping there's the online

580
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Play and all that I haven't again I've played

581
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Like maybe 15 minutes of this

582
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Before I got distracted with something else

583
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So I'll try to play more over the next week

584
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And what have you

585
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelaunge.com

586
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Kaijuto says

587
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Beat Hazard will blow your eye sockets

588
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I played the demo and it almost

589
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Killed me now to be fair

590
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You can turn down the intensity

591
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Of the effects but who wants

592
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
To do that

593
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I will say this as well

594
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
One thing I love about Beat Hazard

595
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Is that there's just

596
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
For what is a pretty simple concept

597
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
They've poured a lot of

598
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Replayability factors into the game

599
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
In the way of like power-ups

600
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And achievements

601
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Like the more you level through

602
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And the more songs you play

603
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You get power-ups

604
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That you can permanently buy for your ship

605
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And then you can you know pick

606
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Like five of the power-ups for your ship for a song

607
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And a lot of times what the power-ups

608
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Do is they do things to your ship to increase

609
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Either survivability or score

610
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So if you're the type that wants to go for the

611
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Highest score possible amongst your friends

612
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You use the

613
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Enhancements that you unlock the more you play

614
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
To get that and I just think

615
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That's kind of a neat way to do it

616
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And what kind of really enhances

617
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The playability of what's otherwise a

618
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Very simple game

619
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I was gifted Plants vs. Zombies

620
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
By our listener

621
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
XLink who was on Horde House a couple weeks ago

622
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's kind of like a late birthday present

623
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And finally

624
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I know Dark Soccer is a huge fan of Plants vs. Zombies

625
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes I am

626
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And I've played the game before

627
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I've played the free one online but

628
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Now I have the PC version and I was playing that

629
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
For a little bit and perfecting

630
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
My strategy against zombies I didn't realize

631
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
There was a whole little mode where you could create

632
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Your own zombie and then like that zombie

633
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Will show up in the final wave as you play the game

634
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh that was kind of cool

635
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think if you do more than one though both of them can show up

636
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh really? I always did the one

637
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Not the point of it at first was just to make

638
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
A little

639
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Avatar that you could use on

640
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Instant Messenger or on web forums and stuff

641
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Which is actually a really smart idea

642
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
To try and get the game exposed

643
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And I'm surprised more people haven't kind of hopped

644
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
On that train where like

645
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Let people make a custom avatar from your game

646
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Which

647
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Okay now I'm sounding kind of stupid because that's what

648
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The Xbox 360 avatar stuff is all about

649
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But I guess this is the first time I've kind of seen it in a PC

650
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Fashion and kind of let them

651
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Spread the word about the game

652
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Like I think it would be a great idea for like the next Elder Scrolls game

653
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
On PC to do is let me make a little

654
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Avatar on my character and then I could use it on

655
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Web forums and stuff I don't know

656
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Something like that

657
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That's kind of neat I hope they have something like that for Saints Bros. III

658
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Because they know they're going to be putting out their

659
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Character creator slightly early before the game

660
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That would be kind of cool to have

661
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You know

662
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Your character on the avatar

663
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So I've bought some games see here's the other

664
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Dangerous thing about the Steam sale

665
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I've bought games I haven't even freaking

666
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Played yet and one of the games I

667
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Bought was Amnesia

668
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Which is supposed to be just like

669
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
A horrifically

670
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Scary game like I was even

671
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Scared by the trailer

672
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It's like seriously like a scare the pants

673
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Off of you game don't play this in the dark

674
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Type of thing so I'm excited

675
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
To check out Amnesia do you know much about this game

676
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Dark Soccer because you like the survival horror stuff

677
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Go look at the trailer on there for Amnesia

678
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You have to tell me if you think it's scary

679
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Or not so alright

680
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That's all I'll say about my

681
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Gaming week otherwise it's been the other stuff

682
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Final Fantasy 13

683
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I think I'm up to like 30

684
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Hours 35 hours spent

685
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
In the game I think I'm getting

686
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Closer to the end I'm still in chapter 11

687
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Because I've been doing crap ton of sidequests

688
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But getting

689
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Closer to the end I'm back in the main story now

690
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm climbing a big tower for those

691
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Of you that know the game and probably

692
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Ring a bell to some of you

693
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Are you running up that hill?

694
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yes I'm running up that hill

695
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
To make a deal with a foul C

696
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And convince them to swap our places

697
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Let's see

698
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Depending on when you're listening

720
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
July 16th

721
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Is the 10th anniversary

722
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Of under sedation live

723
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Which is a show that's been on Saturday nights

724
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
On all games for quite some time

725
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It was a show I co-hosted

726
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Before o-l-r and through

727
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
About the first 6 months to year

728
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Of o-l-r I was actually doing a show on Saturday

729
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And a show on Sunday for quite some time

730
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I had no life on the weekends

731
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But the show has changed and gone through

732
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Some different host line ups and so forth

733
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But what's funny is it's kind of back

734
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
To a very classic line up it's Travis and Jessica

735
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And kind of one of the earliest

736
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Line ups of under sedation live was myself

737
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Travis and Jessica so

738
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The show is just missing me but I'm going to be back

739
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
On Saturday

740
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
To say hello for the 10th anniversary

741
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Happy 10th anniversary

742
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And I know it's just going to be Travis dogging me

743
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
For 3 hours but

744
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That's ok we gave him a little fodder

745
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
He's not great

746
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
After 10 years of hard work I

747
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Suppose he's earned it

748
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But

749
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Not that I'm going to go

750
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Quietly that's what I'm going to say about

751
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That I'm a lot bitchier now

752
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Than I was 10 years ago

753
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
No seriously though it'll be fun

754
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So check that out Saturday night at all

755
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Games radio more information understationlive.org

756
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Now we can get into some gaming

757
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
News let's talk about what's going on in the

758
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Gaming industry this week and get your thoughts

759
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Live in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com

760
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And on the skype line later on

761
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Loki start us off

762
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Ah yes square enix was a little bit sad

763
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
After their game Deus Ex

764
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Human Revolution has

765
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Been leaked out to

766
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The public

767
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Apparently preview code for the game

768
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Which was hosted on steam

769
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The account was hacked

770
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It was a game preview

771
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Code meant for

772
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
People in the

773
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Preview review program

774
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Kind of for the press

775
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And one of the outlets I guess

776
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's a french outlet

777
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And their account got hacked

778
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And this game was downloaded

779
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And then of course it spread out there

780
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Kind of like wildfire

781
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Right now they're going after 15

782
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Unnamed John Does and seeking

783
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Monetary damage in excess of

784
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
$5,000 for the

785
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Preview's distribution

786
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Now the game wasn't finished

787
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But it was kind of a preview build

788
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That leaked out there

789
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And obviously this is not the first time

790
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Something like this has happened

791
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
This is 2, same thing happened to that

792
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And god how many other games

793
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Preview builds get leaked out for

794
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
A lot

795
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But they're none too happy about that

796
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Interesting

797
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Um

798
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Steam's supposed to be like

799
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
The super secure thing

800
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And it's interesting that the game

801
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Kind of leaked off of it

802
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
When it sounds like this might be more

803
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Of like an error

804
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Or some sort

805
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It was an Italian gaming outlet

806
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That leaked that out

807
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Or that the account got hacked from

808
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Not Steam then to clarify

809
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It seems to be kind of

810
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Confusing where it's come from

811
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It seems that even Square doesn't know yet

812
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Rather than aim its suit at the

813
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Italian gaming outlet

814
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The Japanese publisher is instead

815
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Directing its legal team at the 15

816
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
People that stole the game

817
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Or I guess that are

818
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Distributing the game

819
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It takes 15 people to

820
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Download a game

821
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
They don't know who they are because it's gonna be 15 IP addresses

822
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Pretty much, yeah

823
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
What do you think

824
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
About a case like this? Do you think Square

825
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Has a case against these folks?

826
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
If they can track them down

827
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Because they hacked into someone's account

828
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So the crime that's committed

829
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Is impersonating someone else's account

830
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
To get the game

831
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
We'll see

832
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But what if those people come back and say

833
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't have my IP

834
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I wasn't driving

835
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Somebody hacked into my Wi-Fi

836
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That's the problem

837
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Because it is the burden of proof

838
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
They need to have the proof that they did it

839
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And just seeing that you have your IP

840
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
People can spoof IPs easy

841
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Especially if they're smart

842
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
If these people are

843
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
The smart hacker types

844
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Obviously they're gonna be running their

845
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
IP through proxies and stuff like that

846
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So it'll be even more difficult to track them down

847
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I gotta ask you about this

848
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Not to get too tangent-y

849
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
But since you brought up the whole IP spoofing

850
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It made me think of this, a big article I read this week

851
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
What do you think about this whole

852
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Agreement that I'm hearing

853
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That was passed this week between the major

854
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
ISPs including

855
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Comcast, AT&T, and a bunch of the other big ones

856
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And copyright holders, essentially

857
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Where there's the whole

858
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
We are going to

859
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Notify users when IPs are identified

860
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But if it's

861
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Which is kind of what was already being done

862
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But now I think it's more streamlined

863
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And consistent between all the companies

864
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And if a user

865
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Keeps ignoring the alerts

866
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
They will get pop-ups that they have to

867
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Acknowledge

868
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Or they might even get phone calls at some point

869
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I don't know, I haven't obviously read too far into this

870
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't know, what do you think

871
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
About this whole thing?

872
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Well, there's a couple things that are

873
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Weird about it

874
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
One, it would have to be

875
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
The way I understood it was

876
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I believe

877
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's going to be like, for example, if you were

878
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Downloading TV episodes or something like that

879
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Of BitTorrent or something, and they figured out

880
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
That you were doing it, or your IP

881
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Was attached to it, they would notify you

882
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
To make sure that, you know, it's not

883
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Say, someone

884
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Jumping onto your Wi-Fi or something like that

885
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
They would notify you

886
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That that's going on, if you ignore

887
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
That, and then they keep sending you

888
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Notices and eventually, you know, they will start

889
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Throttling your internet and whatnot

890
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But the problem is

891
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I don't think that actual Comcast

892
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Or something like that are monitoring traffic

893
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I mean, it would be very difficult for them to figure out

894
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
What you're downloading

895
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Well, the copyright holders will

896
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm assuming that what they do

897
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Is they seek out the

898
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Torrent, and they download it

899
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And they can see all the IPs that are sharing it

900
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And so they send

901
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Requests to the ISPs

902
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Of all those IP addresses

903
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So, I mean, you can

904
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
There's a way

905
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That you can get around with them

906
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Tracking where you're actually browsing

907
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
But for one, using

908
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
A DNS that's not

909
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Provided by your ISP

910
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You can use 4221

911
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Or whatever is one of those

912
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You can

913
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I think they have ways

914
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You can even download BitTorrent

915
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Via

916
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Proxy or something like that

917
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And you know what?

918
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
There's other options out there other than BitTorrent

919
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I mean, not just BitTorrent

920
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But there's newsgroups

921
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And there's

922
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Just plain straight up hosting

923
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
A file on one of the file sharing sites

924
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Like MegaUpload or

925
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
RapidShare

926
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
MediaFire, whatever

927
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So do you think this is going to be another case of

928
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The piracy will just evolve like it did when Napster got shut down?

929
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I don't think it's really

930
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I don't think anything is really changing too much

931
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
They're starting to

932
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
They're kind of doing it to scare people

933
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
To get them saying

934
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
We're going to be watching what you're doing

935
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But once again

936
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And that's just if you're interested in

937
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Stealing music or

938
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Music or TV

939
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Or something like that

940
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't think game publishers

941
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
PC publishers are really

942
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Going out there hunting these people down

943
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
There's a lot of stuff out there that's still going to get pirated

944
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But you know what?

945
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
If you look at the NPA and the NPA

946
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Two people that are backing this

947
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Of course they're supporting it

948
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Because all the backers you'll notice

949
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Are just all the NPA, the RIA

950
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And all the film

951
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And music studios and stuff like that

952
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You don't see any

953
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Well the thing that surprised me most

954
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
About the law was this whole fact that

955
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
If you want to dispute it

956
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You can, but you have to pay

957
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
$35

958
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
To have that investigated

959
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Something about that kind of struck me as wrong

960
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Like I don't like the fact that

961
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You know, and granted

962
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I try to have a secure setup in my home

963
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And all this stuff, but there's just something about

964
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
My grandma

965
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Who wouldn't know how to do all that stuff

966
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Where somebody else probably set it up

967
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
For her that may not have done it

968
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
If somebody steals that wifi

969
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
She would have to pay $35

970
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
To have that investigated, something strikes me as really

971
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Wrong about that

972
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
If any company asked me to

973
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Pay $35, I would just drop them

974
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Bill, yep, you know what

975
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
What if you have no other options in your neighborhood?

976
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I have to use one particular ISP

977
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
In my neighborhood, and I have no

978
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Other options, unless I want to go to DSL

979
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Which I really don't want to do

980
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I don't really know what you could do

981
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't know either

982
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That's a sticking point for me

983
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I mean, I don't

984
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't really pirate games

985
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I don't pirate games

986
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The last time I would ever pirate a game was

987
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Back in the Playstation 1 days

988
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I would do import games

989
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I would, you know,

990
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Download some of those online

991
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Because I felt it was kind of unfair that if the publishers

992
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Do not plan to release the games in this country anyway

993
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Then what

994
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You know, I'm not gonna pay the outrageous fees

995
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Which at that time were like sometimes

996
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
$70, $80 to own the game

997
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'll leave that to collectors that want that stuff

998
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Blink, blink

999
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But, you know, I'm not gonna get

1000
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
On a moral soapbox about it or what have you

1001
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You know, it's just the way it is

1002
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But, if I'm gonna

1003
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Download like last night's episode

1004
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Of The Voice

1005
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Like, really?

1006
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm gonna get

1007
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
My ISP shut off over that

1008
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Like, it just kind of stinks

1009
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I don't know

1010
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
A little ridiculous

1011
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
If it ends up being

1012
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Where they're gonna be tracking you in a very simple

1013
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Fashion like you said, you know, where they've

1014
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Downloaded the torrent and

1015
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
They do it in a way that

1016
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You know, they can see all your IPs

1017
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
What's gonna end up having is a few things

1018
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
One, people are just gonna stop

1019
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Listing the torrent as, you know,

1020
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The voice episode, blah, blah, blah

1021
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It'll be just some random gibberish

1022
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
They're gonna start, you know,

1023
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Putting stuff behind, you know

1024
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Membership sites or something like that

1025
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Where you have to, you know,

1026
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Be a member of the site to find these torrents

1027
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Or something like that

1028
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
There's ways around everything

1029
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But, you know, as soon as they figure out

1030
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
What they're doing to find these people

1031
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Or whatever, there will be new programs

1032
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
There will be new

1033
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Protocols, whatever, that people will develop

1034
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
In order to get around it

1035
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
They're already renaming torrent files

1036
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
With like

1037
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Weird spaces between letters

1038
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And special characters and things

1039
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So

1040
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You know, you'd be surprised

1041
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
They are going after

1042
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Like, some TV show watchers

1043
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Who was it in chat said they got a letter

1044
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
About Game of Thrones? Oh, there it is, Rama

1045
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I got a notice the other week about someone in my house

1046
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Downloading Game of Thrones

1047
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Granted, that's an HBO show and HBO is a pay network

1048
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I mean, I sort of see where they

1049
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I mean, that is a huge

1050
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Because they make a lot of money off the DVD sales and so forth

1051
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So I can kind of see why they are very

1052
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Rampant about trying to block

1053
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
The

1054
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Downloading of the shows, but like, the over-air networks

1055
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Is the ones that, like

1056
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And I don't know

1057
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
What other extents they've gone to protect their stuff

1058
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I mean, I have nothing, I just

1059
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I hope it doesn't become that, you know

1060
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'll say right now, I download Supernatural

1061
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Because I hate watching commercials

1062
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And so I'll just watch it on my computer

1063
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But I also own

1064
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Like, several of the box sets of the seasons anyway

1065
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Okay, because I was going to say

1066
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Devil's Advocate

1067
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Commercials are what make the TV shows free

1068
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But I also

1069
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Have the box sets

1070
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And a bunch of merchandise

1071
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I have the comics

1072
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You could probably watch them all on Netflix anyway

1073
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Probably

1074
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
But, I mean, regardless

1075
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
There's episodes

1076
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I believe up on WB's

1077
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Not WB, why am I saying WB?

1078
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's a

1079
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
CW

1080
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
CW, yeah, on their website

1081
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So, I mean, it's not like it's a big deal

1082
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I just hate commercials

1083
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Now it's all about product placement

1084
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
That's why we have more product placement games

1085
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I still watch my Doctor Who

1086
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Some of the old episodes of How I Met Your Mother

1087
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And stuff like that, where they're digitally altering them now

1088
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Where they're adding TVs and stuff in the background

1089
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
With stuff on them for different movies

1090
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah, there's reruns of

1091
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Some of the 2009 episodes are like that

1092
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
With The Zookeeper in the background

1093
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Or

1094
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
What is it, Country Strong or something like that

1095
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Huh, I hadn't heard about that

1096
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
God, you

1097
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Nothing in the world would get me to go see The Zookeeper

1098
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Like, maybe if someone threatened

1099
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
To kill my family

1100
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
If I wouldn't go watch the movie

1101
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I guess I would have to go see the movie

1102
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You'd have to debate how much you love your family

1103
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
There would be that moment of pause

1104
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
But

1105
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I mean, seriously

1106
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That movie looks so awful

1107
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I can't even

1108
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Anyhow, real quick

1109
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Before we start jumping back into actual

1110
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Pertinent information

1111
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Have you seen the trailer for Jack and Juliet?

1112
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I don't think so

1113
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It's a new Adam Sandler movie where he plays

1114
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Both Jack and Jill

1115
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
No, I haven't heard that

1116
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You think The Zookeeper looks bad

1117
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Uh, there

1118
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Does he have sex with himself? Because Divine did that

1119
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
In the 70s

1120
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
No, no, no

1121
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But it looks fucking terrible

1122
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Alright, let's get back to game stuff, sorry

1123
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
How about the Wii U? Wii U

1124
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Talking about why was the Wii U

1125
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Showing, you know, a lot of folks at E3

1126
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And I think I had said this too

1127
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Who was showing what said

1128
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Nintendo, maybe Nintendo did this too early

1129
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Maybe they should have just waited until they actually had

1130
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
A little bit more to show, like, I don't know, some actual

1131
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Games and not just a bunch of concepts

1132
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Well

1133
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo

1134
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Has said that, you know what, maybe

1135
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Nintendo did show the Wii earlier

1136
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Than they had planned due to

1137
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
An increased fear

1138
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Of leaks

1139
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What do you mean fear of leaks? There were already leaks

1140
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I know, right?

1141
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
But more could they have possibly leaked out about that system

1142
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Here's a quote

1143
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
In the past, when Nintendo did not receive as much attention

1144
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
As we do now, we did not have to worry

1145
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
About the spread of our confidential information

1146
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Since it did not have any value in society

1147
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But since the Nintendo DS and the Wii

1148
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Created a social phenomenon

1149
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I like how they kind of just slipped that in there

1150
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Please

1151
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Social phenomenon

1152
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But it's actually blowing smoke up their own ass

1153
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Like, that's literally what they're doing in that statement

1154
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You know, since we

1155
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Decided that, you know, our systems

1156
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Are just revolutionizing the world

1157
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
In fact, you know, we would go as far as saying

1158
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
They're about to cure cancer

1159
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But, you know, hey

1160
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That's what the fans

1161
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Are saying about our system

1162
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Why doesn't he just say, thanks

1163
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
To the internet? Because back in

1164
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The day, you know, you would get the word

1165
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
From the Nintendo Fun Club

1166
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Or Nintendo Power, which ironically enough

1167
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Were also both Nintendo

1168
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You have to understand, because we're so awesome now

1169
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Let me show you this graphic behind me here

1170
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You see right here, we were awesome

1171
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But now we are, like, ten times as awesome

1172
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You do understand, that is

1173
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Way more awesome than we were before

1174
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Therefore, we have to show the Wii U early

1175
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Alright, look, I gotta

1176
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Let me read the rest of the statement here

1177
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Because I'm too hung up on this whole

1178
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Now, if this starts to be confusing

1179
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I have a pie chart, too

1180
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Nintendo used to have value

1181
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Nintendo now has value in society

1182
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Anyhow

1183
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Nintendo's next move

1184
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Commands great attention and

1185
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Extreme news value

1186
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Therefore, although we go to great lengths

1187
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
To ensure that this will not happen

1188
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
There are cases where, even if a person

1189
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Receives information under a non-disclosure agreement

1190
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
The information is leaked because there is

1191
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Great temptation

1192
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Even for the Wii U, some people may be aware

1193
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
If they had been checking the internet

1194
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
That information with true and false rumors

1195
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Mixed together was spread on the internet before the announcement

1196
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So they kind of admit that

1197
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yeah, some of it was out there

1198
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Therefore, as for new hardware

1199
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Even if we wanted to, it is extremely challenging

1200
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
To realize the situation where a product

1201
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Is announced and then launched the next day

1202
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So, let's summarize

1203
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That quote in our own words

1204
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Because we are so fucking awesome

1205
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That everybody wants to report on our

1206
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Farts, and has reported

1207
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
On our farts

1208
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
We had to, you left us no choice

1209
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
But to get up on the E3

1210
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Stage and fart

1211
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
They didn't have to

1212
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Wii U

1213
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Wii U

1214
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Wii U

1215
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Here's the thing, they don't have to do shit

1216
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
They don't have to do anything

1217
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
They're succumbing to peer pressure

1218
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That's because they're farting

1219
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I mean, seriously, they don't have to do any

1220
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
If people think that you're releasing a new system

1221
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You can either tell them, yeah, we're releasing a new system

1222
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Or you can just say, I'm not telling you shit

1223
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I mean, what are they gonna do?

1224
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Speculate all they want, but that's all it's gonna be

1225
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Is speculation, and you know what you need to do

1226
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Is you need to fucking clamp down on all those people

1227
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
That are violating your goddamn NDA

1228
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
When some press outlet says

1229
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Hey, I heard that the Wii U has a tablet

1230
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
For a controller, then you tell them

1231
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Well, you ain't gonna see shit anymore

1232
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
About Nintendo stuff because you violated

1233
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Your NDA, you dumbass

1234
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
That's all they gotta do, oh, it's so difficult

1235
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
To secure my information

1236
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Gee, if only there were a way I could

1237
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I don't know, get people to follow my NDA

1238
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Maybe if you

1239
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's called a guillotine

1240
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It's called repercussions for people violating your NDA

1241
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That's why you have a non-disclosure agreement

1242
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Take those fuckers to court

1243
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's in there

1244
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I mean, come on, it's like

1245
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You know

1246
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Oh, you wanna learn about the new Pokemon game?

1247
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Too bad, cause you're gonna have to wait until after retail

1248
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Was Nintendo really worried

1249
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
About disappointing at E3 this year

1250
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Because, like, seriously, Reggie could've just

1251
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Reggie could've got up on stage

1252
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And just hula-hooped for 30 minutes

1253
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And there would be that analysis

1254
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
On X-Play, like Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb

1255
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So, the Wii hoop

1256
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Wasn't that an interesting display

1257
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Of, you know, technology

1258
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Of pelvis shaking from someone

1259
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Who doesn't need to shake his pelvis

1260
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I give those pelvic thrusts a 4 out of 5

1261
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Rob, if they didn't talk about the Wii U

1262
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
What the fuck would they have talked about

1263
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Cause, seriously, they had nothing to announce

1264
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
This year, they had nothing

1265
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
It was like, hey, yeah, well, we've got

1266
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
No, they could've

1267
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Stretched the fuck out of those discussions

1268
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Of the Wii games that they didn't

1269
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Really show, like Rhythm Heaven

1270
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And all the stuff that we poo-poo

1271
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And would they have gotten slammed for that?

1272
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Probably, but then they could've shown the trailer

1273
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
For the last story

1274
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Or Xenoblade, which we all think is happening anyway

1275
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I think most of us going into E3

1276
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Were pretty convinced that Nintendo was gonna show

1277
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
The last story for an American release

1278
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Why is it so difficult if they're planning on

1279
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Working on that anyways, or they're planning on bringing that over

1280
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
That they couldn't announce that

1281
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Even if, you know what, they decide, hey, you know what

1282
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
We're not gonna bring it over here at some point

1283
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
If they change their minds, they can do that

1284
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Games get cancelled all the time

1285
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Look at True Crime, you know, Hong Kong

1286
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
There's a big ol' trailer for that during Activision's conference

1287
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
You know, a couple years ago

1288
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But that game got cancelled

1289
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah, it sucks that it got cancelled, but you know what

1290
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Games get cancelled, so if they decide, hey

1291
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
We can announce this, but there may be a chance

1292
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That we're not gonna bring it over here

1293
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
So what?

1294
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
They're gonna announce, instead of saying, hey

1295
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I hear you guys like Smash Brothers

1296
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Well guess what, we're gonna work on Smash Brothers

1297
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Sometime

1298
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
In the next couple years

1299
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's like, thanks

1300
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I think

1301
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Game guru in our chat room

1302
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
At chat.ownerswanttrader.com says

1303
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
They could've focused on the 3DS

1304
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
You know, and they kinda did for half their conference

1305
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Their conference this year was the Zelda thing

1306
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Which, that did feel like a bunch of hot air

1307
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Like, I'm sorry, but the whole Zelda thing

1308
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's like, okay, you've been showing this game for like four years

1309
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And the whole symphony thing

1310
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And all that was really just dragging it out

1311
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Like, we know you're fucking showing the Wii U

1312
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
This is just, you know

1313
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
This is literally just pomp and circumstance

1314
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
About how fucking great Nintendo is

1315
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But here's the great thing about Nintendo

1316
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
They could've done pomp and circumstance

1317
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Like, they could've done, like, symphonic

1318
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Announcements for all those 3DS games

1319
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Like, they could've had somebody dressed up as

1320
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
They could've had Rama, Black Luigi

1321
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Come out and go, hello

1322
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And look where it goes

1323
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Miyamoto with the fucking shield and sword

1324
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I mean, that's like, just like

1325
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
That's the kind of crazy bat shit

1326
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Stuff that they need to be doing again

1327
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
To get people excited about the games

1328
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I'm sorry, you know what

1329
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Every time I see them put out a new

1330
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Mario Kart and Animal Crossing game or something like that

1331
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I mean, really, what the fuck are they doing?

1332
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
They're adding some more useless garbage

1333
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
On top of these games

1334
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And then they're re-releasing them back out into the market

1335
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Or, hey, look, I know you guys wanted

1336
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Star Fox, so we're gonna give you Star Fox

1337
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That we gave you before

1338
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Awesome!

1339
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Hey, I hear you guys like Mario Brothers

1340
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
We're gonna give you Mario Brothers 64 HD

1341
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Or in 3D

1342
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Thanks?

1343
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I mean, it's just

1344
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It's kind of annoying that they've got, I mean

1345
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
To me, there's

1346
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I understand that, you know, there's a whole place

1347
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Where, hey, you know what, these games are good

1348
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Let's re-release them for a new generation

1349
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Or some garbage that you wanna spew

1350
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
That basically, oh, well, we've run out of ideas

1351
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So we're just gonna take some of these old games

1352
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And, you know, put them back out again

1353
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
We're gonna put as minimal amount of effort into them

1354
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
To make them look new again, but we're gonna put them

1355
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Back out there, because this is what the fans want

1356
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You know what?

1357
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Fans

1358
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Let me just talk to you here real quick

1359
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Here's something that you can do, guess what

1360
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
You know that those consoles

1361
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
When people are done playing them

1362
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
They're still out there

1363
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I mean, they don't just, like, evaporate

1364
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
They are out there

1365
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I thought they were on the landfill in New Mexico

1366
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I know, it's so crazy

1367
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Did you know that if you wanna play

1368
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Oak Green Up Time, you don't have to spend

1369
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
$299 plus, you know,

1370
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
$40 for the game

1371
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yes, I know, this is a shocker

1372
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
That's not what Beyonce told me in the ad

1373
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I understand, but Beyonce's full of shit

1374
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Here's all you have to do

1375
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
You can literally go out to your local

1376
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Garage sales, or

1377
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
There's this website out there called eBay

1378
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Where people sell things

1379
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
This is a game that Robin Williams named his daughter after

1380
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Isn't that worth $300?

1381
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Yeah, but Robin Williams is kinda crazy

1382
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Didn't you see the crazy beard?

1383
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It's starting to look like a homeless crazy beard

1384
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I see where you're going with that

1385
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It's beyond Santa Claus

1386
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So, you can go on eBay

1387
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And you can buy a Nintendo 64

1388
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And Oak Green Up Time

1389
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And guess what?

1390
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Just be careful that it's not coming from China

1391
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
For a limited amount of time

1392
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
It's within that $299 price range

1393
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
About, I don't know,

1394
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
40 other games!

1395
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And you can play it

1396
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
All on your

1397
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You can buy everything on the Steam Marketplace right now

1398
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
For $299

1399
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And you can play it, and yes, it won't be in 3D

1400
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
But you know what?

1401
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Actually, wrong

1402
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
It doesn't matter, because you know what?

1403
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You're playing with it

1404
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The way it was meant to be played on Nintendo 64

1405
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I don't understand why

1406
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
That's the whole thing with the 25th anniversary collection or whatever

1407
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
That $40 could have easily bought you

1408
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
$40 could have bought you

1409
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
We need to do a mock commercial for 3DS

1410
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Oak Green Up Time

1411
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
That has the whole interspersed Robin Williams and his daughter

1412
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And I'll play the game

1413
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
The way it was meant to be played

1414
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Just $1999 on eBay

1415
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It's not even $1999

1416
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I don't know

1417
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It would have been different

1418
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
If it was something like

1419
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Hey, you know what?

1420
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
We're going to bring out a Zelda anthology

1421
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
We're going to have Zelda 1, Zelda 2

1422
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
All of them on one disc

1423
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Like they kind of did for the pre-order thing for Wind Waker

1424
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It was a pre-order bonus!

1425
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Pre-order bonus!

1426
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Stuff that nowadays is just like a code for a shirt

1427
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
For my character in game

1428
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Or armor that's red instead of silver

1429
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I mean

1430
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Why couldn't they just

1431
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
They could sell that disc

1432
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
They could easily just stuff

1433
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
A couple more games on there

1434
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Put Wind Waker in the box or something like that

1435
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Cause that game hasn't been sold forever

1436
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Throw Twilight Princess back in there

1437
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Because hey, you know what?

1438
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
In case someone doesn't have it

1439
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And a little bit of extra content

1440
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And holy crap, that's a great deal

1441
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And actually worth my time

1442
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And hell, you don't have to do anything to them

1443
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Because people liked the games the way they were

1444
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But no

1445
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
They need an excuse for people to buy the 3DS

1446
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It's kind of a gimmicky system

1447
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And so what a better way to do that

1448
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Is to take one of their most popular Zelda games

1449
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And just put it back out there

1450
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
With minimal effort

1451
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
There's actually more to this whole Wii U story

1452
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Let's make it a four hour show tonight

1453
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Let's get Loki more to rant about

1454
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
The Wii U apparently will not have a unified online network

1455
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Like Xbox Live or something like that

1456
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
As if these kind of earlier quotes and things

1457
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Are to be read into

1458
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Reggie Fils-Aime

1459
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I guess in a recent interview with Forbes

1460
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Said that Nintendo is

1461
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Quote, creating a much more flexible system

1462
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
That will allow the best approaches

1463
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
By independent publishers

1464
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
To come to bear

1465
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So instead of a situation where a publisher

1466
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Has their own network and wants

1467
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
That to be the predominant platform

1468
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And having arguments with platform holders

1469
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
We're going to welcome that

1470
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
We're going to welcome that from the best and the brightest

1471
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Of the third party publishers

1472
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
No, here's the way I look at that

1473
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
We have no plans

1474
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
We're just going to leave it up to you

1475
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I honestly am reading that as

1476
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
We're looking at the third parties

1477
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
To do the work for us

1478
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm sorry, that's what it is

1479
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I'm sure that everybody has trouble

1480
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Working with Xbox Live

1481
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
To me, I don't see any publishers

1482
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Having trouble working with Xbox Live

1483
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
This is funny

1484
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Because this does tie into something topical

1485
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And it's the whole EA vs. Steam thing

1486
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
That's going on

1487
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
That yes, I realize comes up later in the show

1488
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
There's this whole thing going back and forth

1489
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
With EA and Steam right now

1490
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Where Steam has forbidden the EA games

1491
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
To come on the marketplace

1492
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
For Steam

1493
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And a lot of it has to do with the fact that EA

1494
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Wants to have their own servers

1495
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
For their own patches

1496
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And EA wants it all to themselves

1497
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And this was a big sticking point early on

1498
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
With Microsoft in the early days of Xbox Live

1499
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So

1500
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Nintendo, in a way, can kind of point at that

1501
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And say, we're not being lazy

1502
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
We're just doing what EA wants

1503
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
No, they are being lazy, because guess what

1504
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Who did they bring out on stage?

1505
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
EA. But guess what?

1506
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
EA is still doing that, though

1507
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
EA has their own, like, you have to sign in

1508
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Through the EA service or whatever

1509
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
In order to play the EA games online

1510
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Because, remember, Project $10

1511
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
That's all part of that fun stuff

1512
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And then, same with like

1513
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I think there's some other services

1514
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Ubisoft has their

1515
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Kind of thing where you have to log into

1516
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
As well, but EA, I know for a fact

1517
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
They have their, you know

1518
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
EA games login that you have to do

1519
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So they have their own thing on top of this

1520
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
The fact that they don't have a unified

1521
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Service or something like that is basically

1522
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Nintendo's way of saying, we don't

1523
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Know what we're doing. I'm sorry, I think that's kind of

1524
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
What it is, because they don't want to invest time

1525
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Into some sort of service like that and have it be

1526
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Inferior. Well, they sort of, and they sort of

1527
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Brought out the guy from EA

1528
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Coincidentally enough, at E3

1529
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And I got the sense that

1530
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Like, I don't know how much

1531
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I can't remember now how much was said

1532
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
About online, but I remember walking away from that

1533
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Getting the sense that, like I

1534
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Was actually asking myself for a minute, like

1535
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Is EA doing their online stuff?

1536
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Like, is EA going to be doing the online stuff?

1537
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It wasn't that at all. No, I know that's not what they

1538
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
But that was, like, for a moment, that was the impression

1539
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I was getting about what was being said

1540
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Because they didn't really bring up their online stuff

1541
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
All it really, to me, said is, hey look

1542
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
We have EA on board, they believe in our system

1543
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And EA is, you know, one of the

1544
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Biggest publishers in the world

1545
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
So, you all should believe in our system

1546
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
You know, don't you

1547
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
See the math? This is how you, you know

1548
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Because they believe in us, you have to believe in us

1549
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
That, that's

1550
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It's right here, it's on the chalkboard

1551
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Alright, one more piece of information

1552
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
On the Wii U, and that has to do with

1553
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Demos for the 3DS and Wii U

1554
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Another quote from Satoru

1555
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Iwata in a conversation with investors

1556
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Quote, when Nintendo would like to ask

1557
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Users to try a specific new game

1558
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
We should deliver it to their Nintendo 3DS

1559
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And possibly Wii U

1560
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
With their prior consent, and recommend

1561
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
That they just try it, and if they like it

1562
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
They can pay for it. In this way, we need to

1563
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Introduce users to unknown products

1564
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Consumers are likely to be

1565
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Convinced to pay about 5,000 yen

1566
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
For a well-established franchise product

1567
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
But not all the people are willing to pay a certain

1568
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Amount of money for an innovative but unknown

1569
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Product. Now is the time to prepare for

1570
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
These situations. So what's interesting about that

1571
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Is Nintendo is basically saying, we need to find

1572
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
A way to just put demos on people's systems

1573
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Now, he does it, now

1574
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
There is a very important quote before you run away

1575
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
With this that says, you know, with their

1576
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Prior consent. They're already doing this, they're already

1577
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Doing this on the 3DS as far as like

1578
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Cause the stupid Pokemon thing downloaded

1579
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
To mine, I'm like, I don't want this fucking shit

1580
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
No, it didn't download automatically, did it? You had to get it through

1581
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
The store. I had to get mine through the store

1582
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
No, mine downloaded automatically. Really?

1583
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I know that OK Go video came in on one of the

1584
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Matches automatically, and then it was taken away

1585
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
But that's not a big deal. I mean, they have the same type of thing

1586
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Right now. In fact, I think it's still around

1587
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
On Xbox Live Arcade. Remember, you could

1588
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Sign up, basically, and have all the demos

1589
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
For the games that come out, you know, download to your system

1590
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
You can try them if you like them, then you buy them

1591
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Well now, this could be a big deal for people

1592
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That are, I mean, you know, OK, fair enough

1593
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Xbox does it too, but just, you know, throw it out there

1594
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
People that have to watch their bandwidth

1595
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And, you know, with this whole 250

1596
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Gig bandwidth, some people get close

1597
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
To that with all the HD movies they watch

1598
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Some people don't, maybe don't want all that data

1599
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Coming through. Well, then they don't have to

1600
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Sign up for it, but here's the thing that I think

1601
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Is more interesting is the fact that they're putting out demos

1602
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Say, I mean, Nintendo, a company that

1603
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
They've said, hey, you know what?

1604
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Our games are so awesome

1605
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Remember, chart 10 times awesome as before

1606
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
That we don't need demos

1607
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
For them. We're just gonna, you know,

1608
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
We're putting that stuff out there, and you're gonna see Nintendo

1609
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And you're like, oh, I gotta buy that

1610
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And so now, they realize

1611
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Hey, you know what? People like playing demos

1612
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
To see if your game's crap

1613
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Or not

1614
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Alright, well

1615
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I like demos and hate crap

1616
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Do you like crappy demos?

1617
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
No

1618
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Alright, let's move on with more news

1619
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Well, I like them because I don't have to pay for them

1620
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Dark Soccer, while you're at it, why don't you give us some more gaming news

1621
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Well, how about some Zoonie stuff?

1622
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
There is a rumor that the

1623
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Zoon Marketplace is being revamped

1624
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
On Xbox 360 as a streaming

1625
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Video service

1626
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And it already had the ability to

1627
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Stream, but this is specifically

1628
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
For some sort of service they're gonna

1629
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Be offering, I believe something along the lines of

1630
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Like Netflix, but this of course

1631
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Is under the Zoon brand

1632
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Microsoft

1633
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Basically saying

1634
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
No comment, blah blah blah

1635
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But, it could already be happening

1636
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I mean, this could

1637
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Be related to what they were announcing

1638
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
At E3

1639
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
At their press conference, or maybe related to

1640
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Xbox Live Diamond, who knows

1641
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Like

1642
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Okay, I already have Netflix

1643
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Well, you know

1644
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I already have Hulu

1645
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Xbox has been kind of centralizing a lot of their stuff lately

1646
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And kind of folding in dated brands

1647
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Like we had the story last week about Game for Windows

1648
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Kind of becoming Xbox.com

1649
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Didn't Xbox stop making the Zoon

1650
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Like about a year and a half ago

1651
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
So, it's no surprise at all that

1652
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Something had to happen to the Zoon Marketplace

1653
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Well, and it makes sense to me because

1654
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I look at even like the Playstation Network

1655
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And stuff, they have

1656
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I don't even know how many streaming services on there

1657
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Sony has one, they have Vudu

1658
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And Netflix

1659
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And I'm sure Hulu Plus

1660
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Is on there

1661
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I think there's a few other ones on top of that

1662
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
So it makes sense that they would have a few different offerings

1663
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
On the Xbox Marketplace

1664
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
As well

1665
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
They gotta do something with that Zoon name

1666
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I would, yeah

1667
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
But they're not gonna call it the Zoon

1668
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
They're probably just gonna have some Microsoft streaming

1669
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Service or something like that

1670
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I don't know

1671
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
This is kind of funny

1672
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Remember how we talked about Gears of War 3 leaking out last week

1673
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Well, who

1674
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Who possibly could have leaked this out

1675
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But actually

1676
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It was funny because it was

1677
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Linked out by a

1678
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Third party

1679
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I guess outsource

1680
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Company that was storing

1681
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
The code on their website

1682
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Codify, they're a

1683
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Australian based hosting company

1684
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Which lists Microsoft as a client

1685
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And it

1686
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Literally was behind no protection whatsoever

1687
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
All you had to do was go to

1688
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Xbox.codify.com

1689
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Which is now obviously locked up

1690
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And you can literally

1691
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Find the code right there

1692
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Just go and

1693
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Download the whole

1694
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Folders and everything

1695
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Right for the picking

1696
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
That's just straight up embarrassing

1697
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
That is pretty bad

1698
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Not even a login or password

1699
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
The password wasn't password

1700
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
There's just no password

1701
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
No login, no password

1702
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
There was confidential in the folder

1703
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Oh please

1704
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
That was a dopey thing to do

1705
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Someone's head's rolling for that decision

1706
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
That was just a lazy

1707
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Dumb thing to do

1708
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I don't care what game it was

1709
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It's an unfortunate result

1710
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And that doesn't make the result right

1711
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But come on

1712
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
To take no security whatsoever

1713
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Was a horrible decision

1714
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
It is pretty bad

1715
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And clearly this company

1716
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Has no security

1717
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Officer

1718
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Cyber security person

1719
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Specialist

1720
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Clearly this company has none of that

1721
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Or that person has been on vacation for six months

1722
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Dude, I mean, you could seriously

1723
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Go on

1724
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
On any of these file sharing sites

1725
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Hell, they could have used

1726
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Like a site like mega upload

1727
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Or something like that

1728
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
You know, some ridiculously stupid website

1729
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And at least that you can put a password on

1730
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
This site, nothing

1731
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Randy in our chat room says

1732
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Somewhere an employee is being yelled at

1733
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I would say somewhere in a Microsoft meeting

1734
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
An agreement is being terminated

1735
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
With this company

1736
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I would say that

1737
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's gonna be a lot more serious

1738
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And then people at that said company

1739
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Are gonna lose their jobs

1740
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And the sad thing is, it's not gonna be anybody

1741
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Involved with this

1742
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It'll be the fault of the executive

1743
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Who didn't hire a privacy person

1744
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
You know what's funny too

1745
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Not only was the game leaked

1746
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But there was some of the tools that they used for the game as well

1747
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Leaked with it

1748
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It's awesome

1749
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
It's sad

1750
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Alright

1751
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
The gamers will never go away

1752
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
But we've got to address them because it's making

1753
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
The way around the game blogs

1754
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Let's see

1755
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Taiwan based component makers

1756
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
According to Digitimes

1757
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Have said that

1758
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
The Playstation 4 will feature

1759
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Body movement control

1760
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Similar to Kinect

1761
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And it's going to be released in 2012

1762
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
This is coming from Foxcon

1763
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I'm sorry, it's not coming from

1764
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
The report is further saying

1765
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
That Foxcon and Pegatron technology

1766
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Who make the PS3

1767
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
They will also be working on the Playstation 4

1768
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
The shipment volume of the Playstation 4

1769
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
In 2012 is supposed to be at least 20 million units

1770
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
So there you go

1771
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Supposedly

1772
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
The Playstation 4 is coming out as soon as next year

1773
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
There's a few things

1774
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
That seem a little weird about that

1775
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I mean, very well

1776
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Let's say if it was actually coming out next year

1777
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Then yes, it would probably have to be starting production right now

1778
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
But a few things

1779
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
That seem kind of off on that

1780
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Is the fact that they're looking to ship 20 million units

1781
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I mean, even if it was 20 million units worldwide

1782
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
No console launch

1783
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Has been that big

1784
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Never that big

1785
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And that would be a lot of units just sitting there

1786
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
A lot of wasted resources

1787
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
They're going to want to have that launch

1788
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Basically the numbers

1789
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
As on as possible

1790
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Because you don't want to just have all this

1791
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Hardware sitting there that's not being sold

1792
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Because that's money

1793
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
That you're just pissing away

1794
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So my guess, I mean

1795
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
The best console launch is I would imagine that you could

1796
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Probably push maybe

1797
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Maybe 5 million

1798
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
You know, as a console launch

1799
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Or something like that

1800
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
For something like this

1801
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I mean, that would be a lot

1802
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Just like right away

1803
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So 20 million, that seems wrong

1804
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
The other thing that strikes me as odd

1805
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
About this story is the whole

1806
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
It will feature body movement control

1807
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
To disconnect

1808
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I'm looking at that a little bit through side eye

1809
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Because that would show me that

1810
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Sony has already abandoned the Move

1811
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I wouldn't doubt that they would though

1812
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
That makes sense

1813
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I'm a little yes and no on that

1814
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I mean, the Move definitely probably has not broken through

1815
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
The way it should have

1816
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Or the way that Connect has

1817
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
But at the same time

1818
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
There's a part of me that wants to say

1819
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Connect hasn't really proven itself

1820
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
But at the same time, yes it is the fastest selling

1821
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Like the Connect is in the rut that the Wii was in

1822
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
At the same time, we all should have seen it coming

1823
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
That, you know, after the initial wave of games

1824
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
There's just kind of a bunch of finger tapping

1825
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
On the desk, there's not a lot

1826
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And not a lot that we got excited about at E3 this year

1827
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
There will be some stuff coming out

1828
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
But yeah, it's not

1829
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It's not really a lot of stuff that's

1830
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Diverting from what's already out there

1831
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
There's going to be dancing games

1832
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Because obviously those have done well

1833
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
There's going to be sports games because those have done well

1834
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
There's going to be kind of the same type of fairy

1835
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
On like the Wii because that's

1836
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Just what's working

1837
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Yeah, and the other thing you also have to consider too

1838
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Is that

1839
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
They're still making PS3s

1840
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And they're still, you know, the PS3 is

1841
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Going to be their push, especially with the fourth core

1842
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
That they have right now

1843
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
They're going to be wanting to have tons of PS3

1844
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
And it's going to be hard to have

1845
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Two systems being

1846
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Manufactured at the same time

1847
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
You know, I

1848
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I just don't see it happening this soon

1849
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I think they're just going to stick to their ten year plan

1850
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Because they kind of do that with the move

1851
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And I don't know if they've really tapped out yet

1852
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
With what they can do on the PS3

1853
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I hope not, I mean it's not

1854
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I think that they can do a lot more

1855
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And at the end of the day it's still

1856
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
A cheap Blu-ray player for a lot of people

1857
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
That, you know, are as Blu-ray

1858
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Is getting into more and more homes as HDTVs

1859
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Get in more and more homes

1860
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I think, you know, Sony still has that advantage

1861
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
That they're the only ones that's a Blu-ray player

1862
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Still at the end of the day

1863
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So, you know, and I think that's been helping

1864
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Move a lot more units than they might want to admit

1865
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
That they would probably

1866
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Chalk up to the quality of the games

1867
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And so forth, but I think the fact that it's a Blu-ray player

1868
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Has been really moving it

1869
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
So where the hell does the story come from?

1870
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Is it just a bunch of bullshit?

1871
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Or could it maybe be that there's some type of

1872
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
New PlayStation 3 redesign in the works

1873
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I could see that before I would believe

1874
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
That a PlayStation 4 is in the works

1875
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Like yet another PlayStation 3 slim

1876
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Maybe with

1877
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Move more integrated into it or something

1878
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I don't know if they would do that, but like

1879
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Um

1880
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I don't buy this yet

1881
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I mean, cause there's, other than someone saying

1882
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Oh, well this is what's gonna happen, we haven't seen any

1883
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
You know, like with the FoxCon announcements

1884
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Usually a lot of that will see, you know

1885
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Pictures of the motherboards or something like that for these

1886
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And um

1887
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
You know, some sort of physical evidence for it

1888
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Cause right now just one person's saying that that works

1889
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Because you work at a

1890
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I mean, you don't even know if you work there

1891
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
You just say that you're a worker for one of these

1892
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Places, doesn't necessarily

1893
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I don't know, I don't know if I can trust that source

1894
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I would just be willing to bet right now that

1895
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
It's probably

1896
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
You know, I think it's gonna be

1897
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
A while still before we see the new console

1898
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Unless, unless of course the Wii U really takes off

1899
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And I think that they're gonna have to kinda

1900
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Speed things along a bit, but I don't

1901
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Honestly, with the Wii U, I mean

1902
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I don't think it's gonna all of a sudden

1903
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Just take over, I mean

1904
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
The Wii is still the number one

1905
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Selling console right now, but

1906
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I don't think it's

1907
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I don't think it is anymore, if you look at the monthly numbers

1908
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I haven't been able to look at

1909
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
The NPD reports have changed, so I haven't gotten to see

1910
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
A lot of stuff, but

1911
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
You know

1912
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It's not like

1913
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I think it's still cumulatively the top overall

1914
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
But it's not the month to month

1915
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Overall, it's the largest

1916
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Selling system, but

1917
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I just, I don't think

1918
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
That this Wii U is gonna be

1919
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I don't think they're gonna be able to pull

1920
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Wii numbers again, because

1921
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
It's kind of like, well, we've already seen

1922
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
That, and yeah, the tablet thing is a little

1923
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Bit new, but

1924
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I don't know if it's gonna be enough to get people into

1925
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I mean, look at the 3DS, perfect example

1926
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
The 3D's new

1927
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And I mean, granted, you know

1928
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
If all things were correct

1929
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
If they had a good launch lineup

1930
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I think that things should have done really well

1931
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But they just aren't utilizing

1932
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
It enough, I mean

1933
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
3D looks okay, but

1934
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
It's just nothing, it's like

1935
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I've kind of seen the tilt controls

1936
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I've seen that before, you know

1937
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
All the stuff I've seen this before, it's not new

1938
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Alright

1939
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
One more story for you guys, then we're gonna

1940
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Travel around the world and look at release dates

1941
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And what's coming out in a country near you

1942
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
But first, releases, I'm sorry, first

1943
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
A story from Dark Sakura, then releases

1944
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I was about to say, what are you doing skipping my story

1945
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Well

1946
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
The

1947
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
PSP had a digital comic service

1948
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
And Sony said, nope, not anymore

1949
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Cut

1950
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Yes, it is going away

1951
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:17,000
It has over 4,000 different comic book issues on it

1952
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
But the digital comics

1953
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Is going away

1954
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
For the PSP at least

1955
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
It may go to other Sony devices

1956
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
But not to the PSP

1957
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I think they're getting ready to transition

1958
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
To Vita Land, Vita Land

1959
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Well, what do you think about this, Dark Sakura

1960
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
You're probably the biggest comic book fan here

1961
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Out of the bunch, and you know, I know you

1962
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Like the traditional comic books

1963
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
How did you feel about comics on PSP?

1964
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I didn't care about them, really

1965
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I've got comics on my iPhone

1966
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I have Marvel, I use

1967
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Marvel's digital service

1968
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I have stacks of comic books

1969
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
All over the house

1970
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I have a drawer in my bedroom that's nothing but comics

1971
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
We have a bin at Dan's Mother's

1972
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
That's nothing but comics

1973
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I have a drawer in my bedroom that's nothing but

1974
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
PEZ dispensers

1975
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I almost got you a PEZ dispenser

1976
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I tried to find you a Cruella one, but they didn't have it

1977
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Anyway

1978
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
But it's like

1979
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I really think that it's a transitional thing

1980
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I think that they're starting to phase out

1981
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
The maybe lesser used items

1982
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
That are directly related to PSP

1983
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And start getting things ready for the new system

1984
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
That's how I see it

1985
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And honestly, I really don't care

1986
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Because you have to be really careful

1987
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
When doing comics for a small screen format

1988
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
And sometimes you lose something

1989
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Maybe at the end of the day

1990
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
They just weren't selling

1991
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Did you ever buy a comic book on the PSP?

1992
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
No

1993
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I'm just trying to see what else they had

1994
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
They had Batman Beyond

1995
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
And Ender's Game

1996
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
And Suicide Girls

1997
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Maybe IOS was just doing it better

1998
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And so people that did want to do digital distribution

1999
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Went there

2000
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Who knows

2001
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
It could be

2002
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
And honestly, I had a few different comic book readers on my iPhone

2003
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
But the ones that I always thought were the best well done

2004
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Were the ones that were

2005
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Standalone releases

2006
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Through

2007
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
The app store

2008
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
For example

2009
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I tried a service and downloaded a few free comics

2010
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
To see what it was like

2011
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And you kind of have to

2012
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Scroll funny through the system

2013
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Whereas when I got the Star Trek movie prequel ones

2014
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Oh, Countdown

2015
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
That's what it was called

2016
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Those were well done because they were actually

2017
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Resized for the screen by panel

2018
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And done where you could see the action clearly

2019
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I'm going to our chatroom

2020
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
There's actually a little bit of love going on

2021
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
For Marvel's digital service

2022
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
DDR Dollar Bill says

2023
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I like Marvel's digital service

2024
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Game Guru says

2025
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I started using Marvel's digital service myself

2026
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Robert M. in our chatroom says

2027
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Will the PSP app still be available for back issues?

2028
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That's a good question

2029
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I don't see why they would close the app

2030
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And I would imagine their agreements with the publishers

2031
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Allow it so that if you have purchased a comic

2032
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
You get to keep it

2033
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
There's no reason for them to take it down

2034
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
They said nothing about taking it down

2035
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
They just are going to stop supporting it

2036
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Right, it'll be like Microsoft Game Room

2037
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
If you really want to go into Game Room

2038
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And download a lot of the old games you can

2039
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
But a new game hasn't come out in about a year now

2040
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Yeah, but they're not going to deny people

2041
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Who have already used the service

2042
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
That would just be really crappy

2043
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Exactly, that's exactly it

2044
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
And for the record, Marvel's digital comic service

2045
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Is really nice

2046
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Very easy to use

2047
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I'll go on Avengers West Coast

2048
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Very quickly with that

2049
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
One of these days I'll get me an iPad

2050
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And I'll check that out

2051
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
But we'll see

2052
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I'm a ways off from that

2053
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Alright, let's go travel the world and look at some release dates

2054
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
What is coming to a gaming store near you

2055
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Logie, start us off with the US

2056
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Not a whole lot this week

2057
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Starting off with NCAA football

2058
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
For Xbox 360 and Playstation 3

2059
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Gods and Heroes

2060
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Rome Rising collector's edition

2061
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Out this week on PC

2062
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Let's see

2063
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
The Elder Scrolls Oblivion 5th anniversary edition

2064
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
With a nice little map in there

2065
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
And some DLC

2066
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Plus $10 towards Skyrim

2067
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And that's only 30 bucks

2068
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360

2069
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And the Wii

2070
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

2071
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Part 2 on Playstation 3

2072
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Xbox 360, Wii, DS

2073
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
And PC

2074
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
UFC Personal Trainer

2075
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
On the Wii

2076
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And let's see here

2077
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And that's actually it

2078
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It's our week

2079
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Alright, let's look at Japan

2080
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And what's coming out over there

2081
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
On the

2082
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I think it would be the 14th

2083
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
It would be the release date

2084
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
There is actually nothing on the Xbox 360

2085
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Of note

2086
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
So turning around here to look at the Playstation 3

2087
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Releases

2088
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Playstation 3 has a couple releases

2089
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Japan Midnight gets a price reduction

2090
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
On July 14th

2091
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
It moves into the Playstation 3 best

2092
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
As does White Knight Chronicles 2

2093
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Moves into the best series

2094
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And I believe the American

2095
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Or the Europe release of that is not too far away

2096
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I've been reading some early reviews on it

2097
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
That have not been too kind

2098
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Also on the Playstation 3 this week in Japan

2099
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Brink and Tenchou no Igo

2100
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
As well as Jikkyou

2101
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2011

2102
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Comes out this week

2103
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
This is a baseball game

2104
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
From Konami

2105
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
With chibi little characters

2106
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Not a series I believe we have over here

2107
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Looking at some of the other systems

2108
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Trying to see if there's actually anything on the Wii at all

2109
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I don't think so

2110
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
But we do have the PSP

2111
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
We have

2112
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Taiko no Tatujin Portable DX

2113
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Comes out

2114
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Music game fans may recognize that as the

2115
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Taiko drumming game

2116
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Looks like there's a new version of that

2117
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
This week in Japan

2118
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Unchained Blades Rex comes out this week

2119
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
And Ys

2120
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Gets price reductions all over the place

2121
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
As they move into the best series

2122
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Ys 1 and 2, Ys 7

2123
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And Ys vs. Sora no Kiseuke

2124
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Alternative Saga

2125
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
All those are getting price reductions this week

2126
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
So if you're an Ys fan that's late to the party

2127
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
In Japan

2128
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Good news, you get to get in cheap now

2129
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Ys 3 is the best

2130
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
One game of note on the Wii

2131
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
16th from level 5

2132
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Inazuma Eleven Strikers

2133
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
It's a sports game

2134
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Coming out from level 5

2135
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It's a soccer game

2136
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Looks like it incorporates characters from

2137
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Various other games and anime

2138
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
So it looks like kind of like a

2139
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Fan wank soccer game

2140
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Good times

2141
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Alright, let's move on

2142
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
With the UK dates

2143
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
We have a few

2144
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Going ahead and pulling up that list

2145
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
On the 11th we have

2146
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Air Conflict Secret Wars

2147
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And the 13th we have Boulder Dash XL

2148
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And Ms. Splosion Man

2149
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
On the 15th we have

2150
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Captain America Super Soldier

2151
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Coming out on damn near everything

2152
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
And also on just about everything

2153
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
But maybe not as many things as Captain America

2154
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2

2155
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Done

2156
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Nice

2157
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Told ya

2158
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Alright, let's do a couple more gaming news

2159
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Stories and then the classic game of the week

2160
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
We will take a stroll down memory lane

2161
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And remember a classic game

2162
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
In just a moment

2163
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
People weren't really happy with the Resident Evil

2164
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Mercenaries 3D save controversy

2165
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
The fact that, you know, Capcom was not allowing

2166
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
People to erase their saves

2167
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Guess

2168
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Their particular save system

2169
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
You know, they didn't allow people to reset

2170
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Because they're claiming it's more like an arcade game

2171
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
You know, where you can't reset scores on an arcade machine

2172
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
You know, this isn't the first time

2173
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Now that I think of it that Capcom has

2174
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Fucked up a save system

2175
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
You may remember Dead Rising 1

2176
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
They had real issues with that

2177
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
It's like, do you guys not know how to program

2178
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
You know, save games correctly

2179
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Is that really a problem for you?

2180
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But they're saying though

2181
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
That their intent was

2182
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Never quite malicious

2183
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
You know, despite the

2184
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Conspiracy theories out there

2185
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
That would have you believe

2186
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
And that they said that the

2187
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Reset saves was a conscious design decision

2188
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Aimed at maintaining the arcade fighter

2189
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Feeling of the title

2190
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
That's so much bullshit

2191
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
It's just ridiculous

2192
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
You know, although they did release

2193
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
This statement

2194
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And now I'm wondering, I don't know if it's bullshit

2195
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
So much as it just was a dumb decision

2196
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Like, I

2197
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Wonder if somebody didn't really say

2198
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
We don't need to program in the save

2199
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Delete thing, it's like an arcade

2200
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Skip that part, like just a dumb decision

2201
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
There is a device out there though

2202
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
That will actually erase those save games

2203
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
That I saw out there

2204
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Cause there was an article I saw where you can

2205
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
They're recommending, well one of the two ways

2206
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
You can delete your save games, one through the game to a campfire

2207
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Two, use this device

2208
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
And the device apparently allows you to back up

2209
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Game saves on 3DS and DS

2210
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
And also allows you to erase them

2211
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
So

2212
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
They could easily just fix this with a patch

2213
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
You know, 3DS games are

2214
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
You can patch those

2215
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
You can patch Capcom, you can patch them

2216
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
You do this shit on consoles

2217
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I mean, why don't you just say

2218
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Hey, you know what, we fucked up

2219
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
You guys want, you know, your save reset stuff

2220
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I'll tell you what, we're gonna go ahead and patch it in

2221
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
So you can reset your saves

2222
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
But no, they're being dicks, so

2223
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Fine, that's fine

2224
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I wasn't gonna buy this game anyways

2225
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And even less reason to do so now

2226
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Yeah, it's kinda one of those games that

2227
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I probably wouldn't have bought anyway

2228
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
But I especially am not gonna buy it now

2229
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Let's move on to a story that's

2230
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Actually, I think this is kinda one of those

2231
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Pretty awesome stories I wanna talk about here

2232
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And this has to do with Dr. Stephen Hicks

2233
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Who is a clinical neurologist at the University of Oxford

2234
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
He is working on

2235
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Some glasses

2236
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
That has technology that's inspired

2237
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
By Xbox 360 connect games

2238
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
iPads

2239
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
And what these glasses are, they're to help

2240
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Blind folks see shapes and people better

2241
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And it uses the technology

2242
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Of the Kinect and the iPads

2243
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
It's mostly for folks that

2244
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Like, they can detect light

2245
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
But they can't fully see

2246
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
The glasses would use these cameras

2247
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
That would be on corners of the lenses

2248
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
To detect the information

2249
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And then it would send it to a little computer

2250
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
You know, because everything's so tiny these days

2251
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I guess it's all in the glasses

2252
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
The computer will then translate the information

2253
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And transmit it to LEDs

2254
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Inside the lenses of the glasses

2255
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
And those LEDs would light up

2256
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
In patterns that you would be trained

2257
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
To understand

2258
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
The visor

2259
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I know, right? And even some blogs

2260
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Around the internet put this picture of

2261
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
LeVar Burton

2262
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
From the next generation

2263
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
With the freaking headband visor

2264
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
But you know, I think that's

2265
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
That's amazing that video game technology

2266
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
That's one of those good stories

2267
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
You'll never hear on

2268
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
CNN and so forth

2269
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
A doctor was inspired by what he saw with the Kinect

2270
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
And what he saw with the iPads

2271
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
He said, hey, if the Kinect sends out

2272
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
These lasers all around the room

2273
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
To detect what's in the room

2274
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Why couldn't you like

2275
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Scrunch the Kinect down into a pair of glasses

2276
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
And have the glasses emit the lasers

2277
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Around the room and then kind of translate that

2278
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Into what, you know, somebody who

2279
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Maybe isn't like totally blind

2280
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
But can see at least light

2281
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Maybe help kind of translate

2282
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
That into something

2283
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Also, the story goes on saying

2284
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
There could be an earpiece

2285
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
That could possibly give detailed spoken information

2286
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Like what time a bus leaves

2287
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Could you imagine that?

2288
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Imagine this

2289
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
On the front of the bus

2290
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
And I'm totally making this up

2291
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
It puts this image in my head

2292
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
The front of the bus has one of those

2293
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
QR type of codes

2294
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
And so a person wearing these glasses

2295
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
The laser could scan that QR code

2296
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
From a distance and tell that person in their ear

2297
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
This is the bus that goes to market

2298
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Or whatever

2299
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
That's amazing

2300
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
That's actually a really good idea

2301
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Copyright it real quick

2302
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Patent pending

2303
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
But you know what I mean

2304
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I gotta hand it to this guy

2305
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I mean, thinking to put the Kinect in glasses

2306
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Is a pretty good idea

2307
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I'm just saying, you know, we have this very

2308
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Scan society where we scan codes

2309
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
And now it's in the iPhone application

2310
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Why can't the visor scan those codes?

2311
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
That'd be amazing

2312
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Kaijuto says

2313
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Name them Kinect specs

2314
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I know we have some blind gamers

2315
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
That listen to this show

2316
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
So I would really love to hear like what you think

2317
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
About this

2318
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Like if this is

2319
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
If you think this is gonna be amazing

2320
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Or if maybe you have

2321
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Trouble conceptualizing this

2322
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Cause you know, I read this

2323
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
And I go, it's gonna help the blind see

2324
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
And I go, oh that's a great thing

2325
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
But you know, I'm not actually blind

2326
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
So I would like to hear from somebody

2327
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
To let me know if like this is actually gonna be a great

2328
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Thing

2329
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
You know they're actually also working on

2330
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Retinal patches

2331
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
That are supposed to rework

2332
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
The way the optic nerve

2333
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Takes in the information

2334
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
For cases of people with nerve damage

2335
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
And it's actually very similar in theory

2336
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Because these are actually

2337
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Relaying

2338
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
It's like they've got these implants that relay information

2339
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Directly into the optic nerve

2340
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So that people can quote see

2341
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
But it's a lot of the same theory too

2342
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Instead it's just a matter of

2343
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Instead of directing

2344
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Going directly into the nerve, it's a matter of

2345
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Providing a projection

2346
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
A display that can be

2347
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Recognizable to people

2348
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
With that level of vision

2349
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
So yeah, that makes sense

2350
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Kaijuto in the chat room says 800 Microsoft points

2351
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
If you want to keep seeing past three months

2352
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
That's wrong, that's just wrong

2353
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
They do say that the goal is to bring

2354
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
In the glasses at under a thousand

2355
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Pounds each, because remember this is being

2356
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Researched at Oxford University

2357
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
But still, I mean, you know

2358
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
That sounds really expensive, but

2359
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
For a piece of technology

2360
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
That you would use

2361
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Everywhere every day

2362
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
That actually does not seem so bad at all

2363
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And pretty affordable

2364
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
That's pretty awesome

2365
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Misty in our chat room at chat.onorsonshadeo.com says

2366
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Hey, pew pewing QR codes is fun

2367
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
You know, there is

2368
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Something about those QR codes

2369
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Like, they're all ads for something

2370
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
But yet, she's right

2371
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
There's something about scanning those codes

2372
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
It's kind of fun

2373
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
But I'm just saying, why not

2374
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Really give those codes a real practical

2375
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Purpose that could actually better society

2376
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Rather than just giving URLs to websites

2377
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
And things like that

2378
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Actually, put them up for events

2379
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Yeah

2380
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
With a lot of the stuff that we do now

2381
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
On school for advertising

2382
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
We actually include the QR codes for the charity events

2383
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
For, like, student council

2384
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Stuff

2385
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
So they use them a lot in terms of

2386
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Passing along event information

2387
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
And I actually find them a lot of times

2388
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Oddly enough, on Japanese blogs

2389
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Interesting

2390
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
They've been having to scan the code

2391
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Things for forever

2392
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Mobile phones have always been more advanced

2393
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Over there. It isn't until we got the iPhone

2394
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
When finally

2395
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
They started looking at our phones

2396
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Going, hmm, we like that

2397
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
But for the longest time, they were far more fast

2398
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Remember the after years? Final Fantasy 4, the after years

2399
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
And the Wii? That was originally a mobile phone game in Japan

2400
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Well, and keep in mind too

2401
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Is that cellular networks are cheaper

2402
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Than landlines

2403
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Overseas

2404
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
So it ended up becoming a much

2405
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Better market to develop

2406
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
As opposed to people here

2407
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I still like my rotary phone!

2408
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I like the noises

2409
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I do like my rotary phone

2410
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
But it's not as good

2411
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
As having to actually call the operator

2412
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And ask to be put through

2413
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
To, you know, Mrs. Cleaver

2414
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Although, you know, if people go to Geek Life

2415
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And click the link

2416
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
For ThinkGeek

2417
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
You can buy

2418
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
A handset for your iPhone

2419
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
A rotary phone style

2420
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Handset for your iPhone

2421
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
You can also buy bacon mince on ThinkGeek

2422
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Yes you can

2423
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Anyhow

2424
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
But follow the link

2425
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Anyway, but back to

2426
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Are we gonna get a kick back

2427
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
For that little plug you just sent?

2428
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Maybe

2429
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
But back to the point

2430
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I mean

2431
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
It really has to do also with how far

2432
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Society itself is willing to advance

2433
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Keep in mind

2434
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I'm gonna use an old comparison here

2435
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Betamax and VHS

2436
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
If you look at the two side by side

2437
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Betamax was the better format

2438
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
You had a better picture quality

2439
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
But it went

2440
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
To VHS because of funding

2441
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Because that's what got the push

2442
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
You know, it's that way with any

2443
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Technology, it depends on what's

2444
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Got the backing behind it

2445
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Where you're, say that you live in Japan

2446
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
And it's better to have a cell phone service

2447
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
You know

2448
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Then, obviously

2449
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
That's where the money is, that's where people are gonna push the technology

2450
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
But here, for the longest time

2451
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
It was all landlines

2452
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Cell phones were novel, you had that big brick

2453
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
In your car, you know

2454
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
But now it's kind of turning around

2455
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Like, you know, Dan and I don't have a landline

2456
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
God, I remember my parents' first cell phone

2457
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Like that fucker mounted in the

2458
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Middle of the car

2459
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And it was this giant handset

2460
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
It looked like it was connected to a car battery

2461
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
It looked like it caused cancer

2462
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
No, we went to a trip

2463
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Coming back from

2464
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Washington one time when Dan's dad

2465
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Had his wedding

2466
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Soon after I moved out here

2467
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
So we're talking about, you know

2468
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Late 90s

2469
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And it looked like a phone attached to a car battery

2470
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
You know what I mean?

2471
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Yeah, it really did

2472
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Okay, who's seen Kill Bill?

2473
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And the phone that Sophie pops out

2474
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
In the flashback scene

2475
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
You know, that's what cell phones look like

2476
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Yeah, yeah

2477
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
So

2478
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
But my point is that it

2479
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Really depends on

2480
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
The market the money is gonna be in

2481
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
So

2482
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
God, I met a kid the other day

2483
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Didn't know what a VHS tape was

2484
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I'm gonna smack him upside the head

2485
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I don't know what a VHS tape is

2486
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Well, because by the time

2487
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
This guy would have been 5 or 6

2488
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
DVDs were out

2489
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
So what? I didn't, you know

2490
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I know what a fucking 8-track tape is

2491
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And I didn't fucking see those forever

2492
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
I think part of it was just trolling

2493
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
It made me think like

2494
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Oh god, you are old enough

2495
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Or maybe you only ever know what it is

2496
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I don't know what paper is

2497
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Paper and pen, I've got a Kindle

2498
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Actually, you know, it's funny

2499
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Going back to Japan

2500
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
They had a phenomenon going on for a while

2501
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Where people were actually forgetting how to hand write

2502
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Certain kanji

2503
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Because they were so used to

2504
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Well basically, on my iPhone

2505
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Whenever I put in anything

2506
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Using the Japanese typewriter

2507
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I get a lot of words

2508
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
That are spelled the same way

2509
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Actually, I could totally see that happening here

2510
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Like, I don't think that's just limited

2511
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
To the complex written language

2512
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Of some of the Asian languages

2513
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Like, I

2514
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I would think even I am challenged

2515
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
To sit down, like imagine if I had to sit down

2516
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And write a letter in cursive

2517
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Like, that would actually take a minute to kind of like

2518
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Like, some of the capital letters

2519
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
You don't write every day

2520
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Actually? I take a lot of written notes

2521
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
But I print, you know

2522
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
But like, if I had to write cursive

2523
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Like, I don't really practice that

2524
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I actually do practice my cursive

2525
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Do you? You're a nerd

2526
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
My mother used to

2527
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
My mother used to sit me down

2528
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
My mom has gorgeous

2529
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Handwriting

2530
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I always got F's in handwriting

2531
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Your son has Parkinson's

2532
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
She would make me sit down and practice my handwriting

2533
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
So to this day

2534
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
And then when I went and took typography

2535
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I had to

2536
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Basically what he had us do is start off with glyphs

2537
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And then find out once our glyphs got to be a little bit more

2538
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
You know, just free

2539
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Free drawing little glyphs

2540
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And once they got to be more complex

2541
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Then we said, okay, what letter does that look like

2542
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And we'd practice full letter forms

2543
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And then pick that and go from there

2544
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
So it was, it was talking about, you know

2545
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
How written language evolved

2546
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Just, you know, from

2547
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Reflex in your hands

2548
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
My printed handwriting

2549
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Got better when I started my job as a corporate trainer

2550
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Because I have to write on the whiteboard

2551
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
All the time

2552
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
And it's actually kind of embarrassing that my handwriting sucks

2553
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Like, and I know, like, I'll be writing stuff on the board

2554
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
And I'm like, oh god, it looks like a seven year old

2555
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Is teaching this class. Practice

2556
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
But, yeah, well, you know

2557
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Well, and I've been doing my job long enough now where it's gotten a lot better

2558
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
But, I mean, that's the whole point

2559
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Is that those handwriting

2560
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Skills aren't being focused on that much anymore

2561
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
So people are forgetting

2562
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
What should be a basic skill

2563
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I mean, a lot of people are actually even forgetting

2564
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
The origins of their language

2565
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Like, I posted something from Crag today about

2566
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Words showing up in the dictionary, like, girl

2567
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Like, the G-R-R-R-L

2568
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And stuff, and

2569
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I'm like, those aren't real words

2570
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Those don't need to be there. That's slang

2571
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
The one reason I would want to be an English teacher

2572
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Is to say, if you use any text speak in a written paper

2573
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
You automatically fail this entire class

2574
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Well, and

2575
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
My teacher, my second grade teacher

2576
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Was mean

2577
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Okay, she was pregnant

2578
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And then had her baby, so I think part of it might have been

2579
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Now that I'm an adult, it might have been postpartum

2580
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Right

2581
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
But the first half of the semester we had the sweetest lady as the substitute

2582
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
And then the rest of the year

2583
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Ms. Bitch came

2584
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Her name was Ms. Bitch

2585
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I'm not gonna say it, I still remember her name

2586
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
But anyway, she used to just walk by

2587
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
And smack our hands every time we started

2588
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Doing a letter form wrong

2589
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
It's like, no, you're gonna sit and you're gonna start from the beginning

2590
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And rewrite the whole thing

2591
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
But I think people

2592
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Are relying too much on their cell phones also

2593
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
To correct their spelling

2594
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
How many more

2595
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
How much more often do you see people doing

2596
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
T-H-E-R-E

2597
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
When they mean a possessive there

2598
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Oh, right

2599
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I think people are relying too much on

2600
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Their autocorrect

2601
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
It goes back to that same thing when I brought up Japan

2602
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
With people forgetting how to write

2603
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
You know, even

2604
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I was even reading an article the other day about how

2605
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
A lot of the original

2606
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Kanji is actually now brought out in more simplified forms

2607
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
And people are forgetting how to write the old way

2608
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
But it's

2609
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I think that

2610
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Having our computers

2611
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
And everything do this for us

2612
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Is making us all lazier as people

2613
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And

2614
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
People are forgetting something that should just be

2615
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Something that you learn in first grade

2616
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Alright, OLR listeners

2617
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Now if you think maybe your handwriting could use some improvement

2618
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Here's a chance

2619
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
To find a pen and paper

2620
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Which might be a chore all in itself

2621
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
But find a pen and paper

2622
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
And write down

2623
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

2624
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Five times every day

2625
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

2626
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Dark Soccer, you're a design person

2627
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Why is that sentence important?

2628
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Because it has every letter in the alphabet

2629
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Good job

2630
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
That's also why it's used for typeface samples

2631
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
But there's a few other sentences

2632
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
That have everyone

2633
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Emma Gray

2634
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Which is one of the type foundries that I follow

2635
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Has different sample sheets out

2636
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
That whole like lorem ipsum

2637
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
No, not the lorem ipsum, different sentences

2638
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
That have the same letters in them

2639
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
See, I'm trying to

2640
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Integrate the geeky design stuff into the show for you

2641
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Thank you, it makes me happy

2642
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Throwing you a bone

2643
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I had a squee, which is why I was showing you someone

2644
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Throwing up rainbows on somebody else

2645
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I'll find the picture for the chatroom

2646
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Alright, well speaking of throwing up rainbows

2647
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Here's some happy music for you

2648
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,000
They can always tell you that the classic game of the week is on its way

2649
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Every week Dark Soccer goes to the gaming vault

2650
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
And finds a game that she thinks you ungrateful children should be checking out

2651
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Especially if you've never had VHS in your life

2652
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Then you probably have missed a lot of these games

2653
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I had a Betamax player

2654
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
I had a Betamax player too, sit down

2655
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I had Clue on Betamax, sit down

2656
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I had an 8-track player

2657
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
With a record player attached to it

2658
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
And transistor tubes

2659
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Hold up to the classic game of the week

2660
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I had the record player

2661
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
That was built into the, well my family had the record player

2662
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
That was built into the shelf

2663
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Because the shelf was the speaker, it was so big

2664
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
And we had Star Wars soundtrack on vinyl

2665
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
And I wish I still had that today

2666
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Because that thing's probably worth a shit ton of money

2667
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
You know what else I had on vinyl?

2668
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Close Encounters of the Third Kind

2669
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
So I could listen to the, the track was called The Conversation

2670
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And I always knew which one it was

2671
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Based on how far apart the grooves were

2672
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
But not only that, I had a record player

2673
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
That lit up in different colors

2674
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
When it was turned on

2675
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
And you would play the Sesame Street records on them

2676
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
That would read the book to you

2677
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
And then when you hear the noise

2678
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Turn the page, bing!

2679
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Oh yeah?

2680
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I had a grandma phone, I had to fucking crank that shit

2681
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
If I wanted something to play

2682
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
My husband's laughing in the other room

2683
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
But actually I'll tell you one thing

2684
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
That I did have

2685
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I had an entire set of Voltron

2686
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Books on cassette

2687
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Black Wolf in Chat says I had reel to reel

2688
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Beotches. Dude, when I studied

2689
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Communication Design in college, we had to

2690
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Learn, like this is just

2691
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
This is honestly

2692
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Should I say this on the radio?

2693
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Say it!

2694
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I have learned more from doing Orange Lounge Radio in the past

2695
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Nine years than I learned in college

2696
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Paying thousands of dollars

2697
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
To attend this communication design program

2698
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And that's one of the reasons why I don't think

2699
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Me dropping out of college was such a bad idea

2700
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
And why I think it's bullshit

2701
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
And employers require BA degrees

2702
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And all this stuff

2703
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I know it's a controversial opinion to have

2704
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
But I don't think school's for everyone

2705
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
It's honestly true because I've seen more people

2706
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I've seen people with more talent in their little finger

2707
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Than people who've

2708
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Got masters in design

2709
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Yet they

2710
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Because in college

2711
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
In college we had to learn

2712
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
How to record to the reel to reel

2713
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
And we had to learn how to edit

2714
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
The reel to reel

2715
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
With fucking tape and a wax pen

2716
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Where you listen to the thing and then you have to do

2717
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
The wax pen to cut out the words

2718
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
And all this stuff and guess how much

2719
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
I've used a wax tape

2720
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
In producing nine years

2721
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
That last longer than most radio shows

2722
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Do on commercial radio

2723
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Guess how many times I've used a wax pen

2724
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
In the nine years of doing this show

2725
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Zero

2726
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Because the state school

2727
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Is not on the cutting edge of technology

2728
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,000
But you could get drinks really cheap

2729
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
I can say this though

2730
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
The design program at Sac State

2731
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Is actually really top notch and some of the people are hiring

2732
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Directly from Sac State now

2733
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Well I'm sure things have changed and so forth

2734
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
But I'm just saying

2735
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Some people learn best from just being thrown in the pool

2736
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And told you better fucking swim to me

2737
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Well there's a book I'm reading right now

2738
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Which by the way the review should be on Geek Life

2739
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
In a few days

2740
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
And I know it's ironic that I'm a teacher now

2741
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
But there's a big difference

2742
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Well but the book I'm reading

2743
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Is an autobiography

2744
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Of a big name in comics

2745
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
And again everyone will find out who it is

2746
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
But it's talking about how he broke into illustration

2747
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
And comics just by

2748
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Drawing all the time and then being hired

2749
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Because of his talent because of his skill

2750
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
And learning how to do

2751
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Newspaper editing

2752
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And you know

2753
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Airbrushing you know in the 30's

2754
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
By being said

2755
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Coach these are your inks

2756
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
So anyway

2757
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I realize my opinion is a little bit controversial

2758
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
But I just speak from real life experience

2759
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I agree with you

2760
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I realize some of the people out there may not

2761
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
And may even possibly be offended but I'm just saying

2762
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
From my experience in my world

2763
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
College did nothing for me

2764
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
But fucked me up emotionally

2765
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Well like with the classes I've gone to

2766
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
I know how to use the programs already

2767
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
But I listen to my teachers

2768
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Who have been working in the field

2769
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I want their experience

2770
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
It's a better thing when you have a teacher that gives you real life experience

2771
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Because they're in it

2772
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
They're doing it

2773
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
As opposed to oh I got my masters and now I'm gonna teach

2774
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
You know what I mean

2775
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
You can tell the difference

2776
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
But yeah I'm sorry

2777
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Anyhow

2778
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Oh you know what else I had?

2779
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I had all of the Gremlins records that they gave out at McDonald's

2780
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
With the Happy Meal

2781
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I had the record that came free in the newspaper

2782
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
That sang the song about the

2783
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Mac McDLT a quarter pounder with some cheese

2784
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Layover hamburger and cheese

2785
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
How do I remember that song? I remember that fucking song

2786
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I had the Fruit Loops one

2787
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Rob I had the Fruit Loops one

2788
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
The one that came in on a square album

2789
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
In a box of Fruit Loops

2790
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
It's like a fucking plastic record

2791
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I know

2792
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I love how we went from throwing up rainbows

2793
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
You know

2794
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
You know you're old school when you've had

2795
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
A warped record and you fixed it yourself

2796
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
You know you're old school when you know

2797
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
That the best version of Alice in Wonderland

2798
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
They ever made was that TV movie in the 80's

2799
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
With Carol Channing

2800
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I know

2801
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Back to rainbows

2802
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
How about some classic games

2803
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Well this

2804
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I'm taking us all the way back

2805
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
To 1996

2806
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
That was before I moved out here

2807
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
And I must thank my husband

2808
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
For turning me on to this series even though

2809
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I did work for Namco for a little while

2810
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
But I didn't really give it much thought until

2811
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
My husband said

2812
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
This game's awesome we're gonna play it

2813
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And it is Soul Edge

2814
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Woo

2815
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Soul Edge

2816
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
You got soul

2817
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
So

2818
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
This is the intro so we have to play a little bit of the intro

2819
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Transcending history and the world

2820
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
A tale of soul

2821
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
And swords

2822
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Eternally told

2823
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Anyway

2824
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
This game had

2825
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
We've actually got this soundtrack

2826
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
It's really cool but anyway

2827
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
This is from the Playstation version

2828
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Soul Blade

2829
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Soul Edge is

2830
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
A 3D fighting game

2831
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
It was the second one that had characters with weapons

2832
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
The first being Toushinden

2833
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
And this

2834
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Actually had

2835
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Everyone had their different style

2836
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Depending on their actual weapon

2837
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,000
This came out in arcades in 1996

2838
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
And then there was

2839
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
A different version that's called

2840
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Soul Edge version 2

2841
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
That

2842
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Was basically a little bit easier because people found

2843
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
The original to be

2844
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Really hard and that you couldn't beat the last boss

2845
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Hwang

2846
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Was put into

2847
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
That version as well

2848
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
He was actually originally a palette swap

2849
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Of Mitsurugi in the Korean version

2850
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
And you could play as Cervantes

2851
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Who was the pirate

2852
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Who had the Soul Edge

2853
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
The sword

2854
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
They also put in air combos

2855
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
And guard impacts

2856
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
And everyone had upgraded moves

2857
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
It came out like I said on the Playstation

2858
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
As Soul Blade

2859
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
And uh

2860
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
It was

2861
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
That's Cervantes music

2862
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I love that song it's so cool

2863
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
But anyway everyone had their own little

2864
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Hold on let me let the listeners have a

2865
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Peek at this music real quick cause

2866
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I will say one thing I love

2867
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
One thing I love about these games is the

2868
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Soundtracks I mean they're just

2869
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Amazing here we go little clip

2870
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
But yes oh that's actually

2871
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I think my favorite piece in that game

2872
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
That's the arranged version by the way from the

2873
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Playstation version

2874
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Cause the Playstation versions had arranged

2875
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Soundtracks as well as the original

2876
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Soundtracks so it was really cool

2877
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Nice

2878
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
At any rate

2879
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
It basically you could move

2880
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Your character all along

2881
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Their little

2882
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Stage area

2883
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
And you had borders around the stage

2884
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
If you fell off of your little stage

2885
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Then that was you know you'd die

2886
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
It's kind of hard though to jump off the stage

2887
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Your jump was

2888
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Actually kind of

2889
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Not really so much of a jump

2890
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
But some characters had better jumps

2891
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
There was also

2892
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
A weapon gauge

2893
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
And it had your weapons resistance on it

2894
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
And

2895
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
When you would block an attack your bar would

2896
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Deplete and if it emptied you would lose

2897
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Your weapon

2898
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
And then you'd have to finish the match unarmed

2899
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
So basically like

2900
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Oops my sword broke oh crap

2901
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
And

2902
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
There were also

2903
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Locking moves too so you'd have to

2904
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Press the button you know at the right time

2905
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
And see who could get out of it

2906
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Everyone had

2907
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
One or two unblockable attacks

2908
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Which actually came from the Tekken series

2909
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
And

2910
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
It was really hard to pull them off

2911
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
So that kept it pretty balanced and then

2912
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
You had critical edge attacks

2913
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
That were long

2914
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Like a long series of different links

2915
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Kind of like have you ever played in Tekken

2916
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
When you used King's throws it was kind of the same deal

2917
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
But then

2918
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
There were

2919
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Different combinations of

2920
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Different attacks that would you know have

2921
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
A special sequence

2922
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
So on top of that it would also

2923
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Deplete a third of the weapons gauge

2924
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
When you used it it was the ABK attacks

2925
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
It had

2926
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Aggressive block which was called guard impact

2927
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
That would

2928
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Give you a free counter attack

2929
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
And then you also had like I said earlier

2930
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
A ring out

2931
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
You can't just jump out of the ring you have to be thrown out of the ring

2932
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
The game

2933
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Itself according to

2934
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Namco

2935
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Took place in 1584

2936
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And it's warriors searching

2937
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
For the soul edge

2938
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
It had different names but it was pretty

2939
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Nasty

2940
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Anytime someone had it bad crap happened

2941
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
So it had all kinds of

2942
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Different characters you had Siegfried

2943
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
You have Mizurugi

2944
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
You had Tamara

2945
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
You had Taki who was your ninja girl

2946
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Voldo oh Voldo

2947
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
He was Mr. Bondage boy

2948
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
His weapon was a

2949
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
K-tar

2950
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
The hand mounted blade

2951
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
And he wore lots of

2952
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Strappy leather

2953
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I'm sure some of us recall

2954
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
And then there was

2955
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Like

2956
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Sungmina

2957
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
And then there was a character added

2958
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Who was in Soul Blade

2959
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
As a secret character

2960
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
It came out on

2961
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Playstation on December 20th

2962
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
1996 in Japan and it came out

2963
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
In 97 in the USA and Europe

2964
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
And it kept all

2965
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
The soul edge version 2

2966
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
And 5 unlockable characters

2967
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Including the soul edge

2968
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
The boss of the game

2969
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Had arcade mode versus mode, survival, team battle

2970
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Time attack and training

2971
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Had an RPG mode called

2972
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Edge master mode

2973
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
So you could basically

2974
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Go through a story had it like they were

2975
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
A character in a book so it was kind of neat

2976
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
And you had

2977
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Extra versions of different weapons

2978
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
That had more power, more strength

2979
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
More durability and like I said

2980
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Also you had an arranged soundtrack

2981
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
And the arcade soundtrack

2982
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
And then you had the

2983
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Khan super session

2984
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Which that's the album that we have

2985
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Is the Khan super session that

2986
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
This band, their stuff

2987
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Is really really good stuff

2988
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
So it is

2989
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Probably one of the best

2990
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Fighting games ever

2991
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
I think

2992
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
I think a lot of people have a lot of love for this game

2993
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I gotta admittedly I didn't get into this series

2994
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Until Soul Calibur 2

2995
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
The arcade version

2996
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Which still is like one of my favorite

2997
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Gamecube games they ever made

2998
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
That's actually from I just noticed this intro

2999
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
That we're listening to the music off of

3000
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
The Japanese intro

3001
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Because they had to put clothes on

3002
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Sofotia

3003
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
And the scene where she's in the water

3004
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
And Hephaestus is coming out of the water to talk to her

3005
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
She's naked in the Japanese version

3006
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
They had to put clothes on her in the American one

3007
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Which is

3008
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Redonkulous

3009
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
And she's got her hands over her boobs so what's the big deal

3010
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Alright

3011
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Anyhow there it is your classic game of the week

3012
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Soul Blade or Soul Edge

3013
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Whatever you want to refer to it as

3014
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Alright

3015
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
That's gonna do it for part A of our show

3016
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
But don't go anywhere we've got plenty more to come

3017
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Looks like it's gonna be a long show tonight

3018
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Including some rapid fire news when we get back

3019

Don't go anywhere, we'll be back after this

3026
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

3027
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
We are live here

3028
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
On this July 10th

3029
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
2011 with episode

3030
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Number 419 of our show

3031
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Which you know means next week is episode

3032
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
420

3033
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Not that any of us are gonna

3034
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Do anything outside of the norm for that

3035
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Week but I just thought it was worth saying

3036
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
That some of our listeners will be

3037
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
But anyhow, just throwing that out there

3038
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Usually at this part of the show

3039
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
We want to plug a couple of the

3040
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Side projects and other things that we're working on

3041
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I do want to go ahead and work in

3042
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
One other plug quickly for the

3043
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Understation Live 10th anniversary show

3044
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
That is going to be this coming Saturday

3045
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I know I'm going to be there and

3046
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Jessica Harper will be there

3047
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
And we're going to be reminiscing about the good old days

3048
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
At Understation Live

3049
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
The show where I started

3050
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
On internet radio

3051
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Although I guess you could say

3052
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I did internet radio in college but

3053
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
You know, again, wax tapes

3054
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
So it really started

3055
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
On Understation Live

3056
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Back in 2001

3057
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Also, Hoard House is the show I do

3058
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
About the world of Warcraft with my buddy

3059
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Xtopher, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth

3060
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
If you are a Warcraft fan you really should check it out

3061
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
www.hoardhouse.com

3062
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I got really angry on this week's show

3063
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
And it has to do with getting booted from a pug

3064
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
And it occurred to me

3065
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I don't know if you saw my reply to a post

3066
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
On our private guild's forums

3067
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
But that night I was so mad

3068
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I think you said something to me

3069
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
DarkSakura, and I was like, this game can suck

3070
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
My fucking dick, good night

3071
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
It didn't occur to me until like two days later

3072
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
I was like, oh god, did she think I said that to her?

3073
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Because I wasn't saying that to her

3074
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
You said some acronym

3075
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
That I didn't understand at the time

3076
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Oh

3077
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
And then afterwards I was like

3078
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Oh, that's what it is

3079
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Because you said VTK'd

3080
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
And I was like

3081
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Oh, vote kicked, yes

3082
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
They VTK'd me

3083
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
But I was like

3084
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
My reply I remember was

3085
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
What? And they were like, this game can suck my dick

3086
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I'm going bye

3087
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
And I'm sitting there just staring at my computer

3088
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Going

3089
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Who's gonna play with me now?

3090
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I had a diva moment

3091
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Where I stormed off the set

3092
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Seriously, that's exactly what it was like

3093
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
And I'm like, seriously, I sat there for ten minutes

3094
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I had time for my character to go

3095
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
On away, and sit down, and pout

3096
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Aww

3097
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
But I mean, I was like, I was trying to figure out what's going on

3098
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
So I started looking it up online

3099
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I was emotionally raped by a guild

3100
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
On another server with that vote kick

3101
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Do the troll dungeons link to other servers?

3102
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Oh yeah, they all do

3103
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
I didn't know about that

3104
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Oh yeah, they all do

3105
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
So be careful

3106
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Oh no, I was just gonna say

3107
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Speaking of voting the kick

3108
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Prior to the mods being patched on Grand Theft Auto

3109
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
When we were playing just regular

3110
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Private matches

3111
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
My co-workers usually tried to vote to kick me out of the game

3112
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Because I'd be kicking the crap out of them

3113
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I was like, vote him out

3114
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
He's beaten

3115
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
That's ignorant that somebody would vote kick

3116
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Just because they're good

3117
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
They think it's funny

3118
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
That's what I keep telling myself

3119
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
That I couldn't just handle my beauty

3120
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
So that's why they had to vote kick me

3121
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
More information on that at Hoardhouse.com

3122
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
We told you about the stupid bitch we had

3123
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
In one of your groups?

3124
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Oh yeah, something like

3125
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
They didn't want to heal the tank

3126
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
We'll tell the story really quickly

3127
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
We were at Grim Butthole

3128
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Sorry, Grim Butthole

3129
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
But it's Grim Butthole

3130
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Because it sucks

3131
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
We kind of wanted to skip the harder battles in there

3132
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Because they're a pain in the ass

3133
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
And it's like

3134
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I just want to run through this really fast

3135
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I don't care about anybody else

3136
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
And then she starts getting really foul

3137
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
And then she's like

3138
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Let's vote to kick the tank

3139
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
And I'm like, bitch no

3140
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I was like, do you read that all of us

3141
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Are in the same guild and you're not?

3142
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
See, you should have vote kicked her

3143
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I started, I did

3144
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
I requested a vote kicker three times

3145
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
And it didn't pass?

3146
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
It did on the third time

3147
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Because it did that delay

3148
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
I was not a rude cunt

3149
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
So there's a big difference

3150
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
But she was, she was

3151
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I've got screen capture, she was that bad

3152
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
And, okay

3153
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I'm going to tell you something everybody

3154
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
And it doesn't matter if you're on World of Warcraft

3155
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Or whatever MMO that you're on

3156
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Be nice

3157
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
You don't get anything from being a bitch

3158
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Or, you know

3159
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Blaming everything on the tank

3160
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Or a troll

3161
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
There's so many trolls in WoW

3162
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
And it's really like

3163
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
What do you really get

3164
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
This is masturbation for you

3165
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I can't think of anything else that

3166
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Trolling accomplishes other than

3167
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Jacking yourself off

3168
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I'm going to give a few pieces of advice

3169
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Now this is a little more specific

3170
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
To WoW

3171
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I will repeat these later on for you

3172
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
In a recorded version if you like

3173
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Rule number one

3174
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Don't be a dick

3175
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Rule number one of the OL army

3176
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Which I know we don't talk about that a lot

3177
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
But you know we do have a steam group

3178
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
We do have several gaming groups available online

3179
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
You know with all the steam sale orgy stuff

3180
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Going on right now, if you're not in the OLR group

3181
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I don't know what you're doing

3182
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Cause the rule number one of the OL army

3183
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Is don't be a dick

3184
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
And so you know you should come join us on steam

3185
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
And more information is at OrangeLunchRadio.com

3186
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
In that little extend play box on the left side

3187
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Well number two refers to how you treat your tank

3188
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
It's a three strike rule

3189
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Number one

3190
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
If your tank doesn't flat out say

3191
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I've never tanked this before

3192
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
And they're doing a bad job, stop and explain the mechanic

3193
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
To them if you happen to know it

3194
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
If they still act shitty

3195
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Give them one more try and if they are just

3196
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Derpy say sorry

3197
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
We need you to leave

3198
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
That really doesn't just apply to tanks

3199
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I think that can go for anybody

3200
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
In any MMO, it doesn't even have to be WoW

3201
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And sometimes people make mistakes like

3202
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I started using, you know when you hit V and the little life bar show up

3203
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I accidentally targeted

3204
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
A creature in a group over

3205
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Because the little name tag

3206
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Was like right next to the one I was targeting

3207
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
And so I made a boo boo

3208
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
But I you know went and reshaped everybody

3209
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
And everyone was happy

3210
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
But it's just like

3211
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Don't point fingers

3212
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Don't lay blame

3213
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
If someone is truly bad

3214
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
A good party will hold them through it

3215
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
If they are being bad on purpose

3216
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Then say sorry you need to practice this one

3217
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
A little bit more, play with your guildies for a bit

3218
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Because I played with

3219
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I will not be in a party unless there is one other guildie with me

3220
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
I just won't do it

3221
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
I did it once though on my first troll heroic

3222
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
But anyway

3223
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
My third rule

3224
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
If you are not on your game

3225
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
You need to step back

3226
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Don't blame somebody else

3227
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
For what you are doing wrong

3228
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Like for example I will use me from the other day

3229
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I was getting motion sick after

3230
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
While you were playing with us

3231
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
And we were an all guild group

3232
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
And when we got people from outside

3233
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
The guild after you had to log off

3234
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Because you weren't feeling well

3235
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I had to stop playing because I couldn't take breaks

3236
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Because I was getting motion sick

3237
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Or if I'm having a bad night

3238
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I'll say you know what I'm just not into this

3239
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I'm going to have to back out because I'm holding everyone back

3240
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
You need to be able to say

3241
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
To take enough responsibility on yourself

3242
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
That you're not going to ruin somebody else's good time

3243
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
So those are

3244
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
My three rules for playing with other people

3245
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Words of sage wisdom

3246
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
From an OMG real life girl

3247
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Yes

3248
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Speaking of MMOs

3249
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I can't remember if I told this story last week

3250
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
So stop me if I'm repeating myself

3251
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I'm getting old and I forget an old age

3252
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Salacious Pop did a really big troll on me

3253
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Because of the Steam sale that's going on

3254
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I was mentioning just off hand something about

3255
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I wonder what Final Fantasy 11

3256
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Is like these days

3257
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
You know gosh I'd be really curious

3258
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
What's going on in 11 these days

3259
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Steam you have been gifted

3260
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
A copy of Final Fantasy 11

3261
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
The complete Uber edition

3262
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Including the new Abyssia expansion

3263
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
It's 11 bucks

3264
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I know I look over at Alan

3265
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
And I go like you're such a fucking troll

3266
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
So

3267
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
That is actually downloading at home right now

3268
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Not that I'm going to log in and play right away

3269
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
But yeah

3270
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I do have 30 days of that that I can check out at some point

3271
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Oh mine finally finished I downloaded

3272
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Champions

3273
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Oh you downloaded Champions the free

3274
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
You know what

3275
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
If someone gave me $11

3276
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
So I could get Final Fantasy 11 Rob I would play with you

3277
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Just to see

3278
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
How lolsy it is now

3279
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
But somebody has to give you

3280
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
$11 good luck on that

3281
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Or just send it to me on Steam

3282
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
It's so easy now

3283
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Alright

3284
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Dan's in the other room saying no more momos

3285
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
No more momos but it's only 30

3286
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Days Dan

3287
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
That's

3288
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
He's yelling

3289
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
That's how Warcraft started

3290
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
And then he goes fucking Rob

3291
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Yeah I know I know

3292
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Alright let's move on

3293
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
We need to do some rapid fire news

3294
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
And talk about some other stuff going on

3295
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Instagaming world

3296
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Loki

3297
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Speaking of Final Fantasy

3298
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
There's a Final Fantasy game coming to the 3DS

3299
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Although this may not be the Final Fantasy game you're looking for

3300
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
It's Final Fantasy

3301
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Um

3302
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Why did I have to make these like really ridiculous

3303
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Fake names

3304
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
The rhythm I guess

3305
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
The rhythm

3306
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
It's like theater rhythm mixed together

3307
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Anyways

3308
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
It is a rhythm

3309
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Game for Final Fantasy

3310
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
So your combat is done

3311
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
The kind of

3312
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Rhythm stuff

3313
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Now Cloud can dance like never before

3314
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Funny that you should mention Cloud

3315
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Because actually I think I see someone

3316
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
In that picture that looks very similar

3317
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I'm just imagining Bust A Move songs

3318
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
In my head with the characters replaced

3319
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
With uh

3320
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Cloud and it's really funny to me I don't know why

3321
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Um yeah it looks kind of neat

3322
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I like rhythm games I like Final Fantasy so maybe

3323
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I check it out but um yeah I mean for

3324
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
People looking for like a Final Fantasy RPG

3325
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
That's brand new and everything

3326
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Um not quite what you're looking for here

3327
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
So but I check it out

3328
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Looks kind of neat

3329
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
New fanboy worlds colliding

3330
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Pretty much yeah

3331
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
And then on top of that Harmonics is of course

3332
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Working on a new IP called Vithrhythm

3333
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
And that's literally all we know about that

3334
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Um

3335
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
They've just confirmed yeah there's something that we

3336
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Can add to it at this time but

3337
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Yes we are working on that project

3338
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
So maybe a new

3339
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Res type game or something like that

3340
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
That'd be kind of neat we'll see

3341
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Um

3342
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
And then finally this is kind of neat

3343
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Rockstar is um

3344
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Trademarked uh Rockstar Films

3345
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
And um

3346
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Apparently you know one of the

3347
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
People are thinking hey you know what uh

3348
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
They did mention one time that if someone was gonna

3349
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Make Grand Theft Auto into a movie

3350
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
That it would it would be them

3351
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Um you know

3352
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
They said that they would be the ones that would want to

3353
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Handle that um

3354
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
So maybe we'll see some movies coming from

3355
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Actually you know I could see something like

3356
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Uh you know maybe like LA Noire

3357
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Or something like that as a movie from them

3358
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Cause um you know it's a little bit more

3359
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Of a linear story

3360
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Grand Theft Auto would be a little bit kind of crazy

3361
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I don't know if they could do that but um

3362
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Neat

3363
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
You know they'd be turning some of their games into uh

3364
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Movies

3365
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Neat

3366
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Which would you rather have first a Grand Theft Auto movie

3367
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Or a Red Dead Redemption movie

3368
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Cause I would think Red Dead Redemption would make a better movie

3369
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
I agree that's just me

3370
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Of course

3371
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Cause usually I beat you here to the show

3372
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
So I don't see your car pull up

3373
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
A whole lot but tonight I was late thanks to an accident

3374
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
So um I pull up behind

3375
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
You and I never realized you had a license plate frame

3376
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
That said I'd rather be playing Grand Theft Auto

3377
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Yes I got that a few months back

3378
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
It's nice

3379
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Alright uh some other quick

3380
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
News here uh an interesting spinoff

3381
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Of the Burnout series that's coming to

3382
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Xbox Live Arcade, Burnout

3383
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Crash apparently is coming out

3384
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
By interesting you mean terrible

3385
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
The thing that's interesting about it to me

3386
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Is it's that whole like top down look

3387
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
It looks like

3388
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Remember

3389
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Ivan Ironman Stewart's

3390
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Super Offroad

3391
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
That every round table pizza

3392
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I guess that's a west coast thing but every pizza

3393
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Joint I guess across the nation had

3394
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
In their little arcade that game was

3395
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Fucking bad ass

3396
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Yeah this looks like one of those type of

3397
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Games but it's fucking Burnout so I don't

3398
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Actually this looks kind of rad

3399
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I didn't look at the trailer so let me

3400
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Let me look at the trailer cause maybe it is kind of poopy

3401
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
If I see it in motion

3402
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Well they have two different trailers

3403
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
What the?

3404
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
No I do not like the look of freshly colored hair

3405
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Yes see that's the thing about joystick

3406
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Is they always have commercials for like

3407
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Hair products for like women

3408
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
That is like the such wrong demographic

3409
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I can't wait until I see a douche

3410
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Commercial come up

3411
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
That and like you know hey

3412
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Your children are visiting the internet

3413
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
They could use AOL's blah blah blah

3414
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
To lock down the internet for them

3415
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Do you have Rampant Vaginitis?

3416
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
I don't know if

3417
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
This trailer is going to show gameplay cause they had a

3418
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Teaser one that didn't have any gameplay in it

3419
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
But the gameplay trailer

3420
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Or a little preview

3421
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Not good

3422
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Let me do the YouTube thing instead of like trying to go to a

3423
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Gaming news website I'll just go direct to YouTube

3424
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
But anyways

3425
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Crash time it's

3426
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Basically you know the crash mode

3427
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
That they had in the other games

3428
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Which hey you know what if they wanted to bring that over

3429
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Into it's own game and make it look like the regular

3430
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Burnout games but just be all the crash mode

3431
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
I'd be fine with that

3432
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
This is an Xbox Live Arcade game right?

3433
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
It also supports Kinect

3434
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Notice the hopping up and down icon

3435
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Right there yes in order to make cars explode

3436
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
You have to hop up and down

3437
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
I can turn that bullshit off right?

3438
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Oh fuck it I won't play with that

3439
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Blow up the pizza truck

3440
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
This looks like Super Sprint mixed with

3441
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Burnout I think this is actually kind of rad looking

3442
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Of course there's not a lot going on right now

3443
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
This would be better if they were like actually driving faster

3444
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Or something It's got fire

3445
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Instead of just causing like a 20 car pileup

3446
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Well that's the point see the car pileups

3447
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Or whatever in the destruction it causes

3448
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Your little meter to build up

3449
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
And then you can explode your car Oh that's like

3450
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
There was a mode like that in one of the older Burnout games

3451
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Yeah crash mode that's what this is based off

3452
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
But that's the thing though

3453
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I really wish it was in that format

3454
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
And not necessarily this because the

3455
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Kinect functionality they have it where you drive the car

3456
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Like you make the 10 and 2

3457
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Steering wheel motions or whatever

3458
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
And then you have the hop up and down to make your car explode

3459
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Which I hate I played that racing game

3460
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
It's terrible

3461
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Just don't like it anyhow

3462
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
One game I do like is Torchlight and Runic

3463
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Games announced that Torchlight surpassed a million

3464
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Units sold

3465
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
This would be across the PC the Mac and the 360

3466
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
They haven't said how much on what system

3467
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
But considering it has been discounted on Steam several times

3468
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I'm pretty sure that helped

3469
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Just like it helped sell Lady Gaga

3470
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
A million albums when Amazon sold it for 99 cents

3471
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Anyhow

3472
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Runic is right now

3473
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Working on Torchlight 2

3474
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
They are still targeting 2011

3475
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
For the launch but they won't allow

3476
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Announce a release date until Runic

3477
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Is closer to being done

3478
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
You can tell that the employees were from

3479
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Blizzard a big chunk of them because

3480
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Blizzard does that same damn thing where it's like

3481
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
It will come out when it's ready

3482
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Kojima Hideo Kojima

3483
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Of course known for the Metal Gear

3484
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Series but also known for

3485
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
A series that was popular in Japan

3486
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Snatcher which kind of has a cult following here

3487
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Announced

3488
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
On the latest edition of his Hideo

3489
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Radio podcast

3490
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Apparently he is going back

3491
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
To something he had announced

3492
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Several years ago but nothing ever came of it

3493
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
He's basically re-announced that

3494
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
A radio drama

3495
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Inspired by the 1998

3496
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Cyberpunk game Snatcher

3497
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
That's been scripted by Suda51

3498
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Called S.D. Atcher

3499
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
It's kind of a spin on

3500
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Suda51's name

3501
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
This is the team up

3502
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Project S thing

3503
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
It's a radio drama

3504
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
It will be released to coincide with the 300th

3505
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Episode of Hideo Radio

3506
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
And Akira Yomoka is going to be doing

3507
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
The music

3508
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Judging by the fact that they're on episode 296

3509
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Now you'll be able to find this episode

3510
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
300. They come out bi-weekly

3511
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
So 300 will be in about what

3512
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
2 months?

3513
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Kind of interesting

3514
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I'm sure

3515
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Snatcher fans will be very happy to hear that one

3516
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Quite

3517
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Dark Sakura

3518
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
In other news we do have

3519
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Some costumes for LittleBigPlanet2

3520
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
The Final Fantasy 7 pack

3521
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
There's going to be

3522
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
From what I can see on here we have

3523
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Aerith, who cares, Tifa

3524
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
We have Vincent, yay, Cloud

3525
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
And Sephiroth

3526
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Well if you have Aerith you can just jump her off a cliff over and over

3527
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
No, if you've got Aerith you just have to

3528
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Stab her over and over

3529
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Or just hold the square and watch her head explode

3530
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Because remember in LittleBigPlanet2 you can explode

3531
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Your little guy

3532
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
That, okay, that makes it worth it

3533
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
The Sephiroth one's kind of funny

3534
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Looking for the record

3535
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
And then, now I actually

3536
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Saw the trailer for this

3537
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
In the theater

3538
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
For Tekken Blood Vengeance

3539
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
And I was like this looks really cool

3540
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I'm going to see that

3541
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
It does look awesome

3542
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
It is a one night only US showing

3543
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
That's going to be before the Japanese release

3544
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
By a little over a month

3545
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
And it has 20 minutes of interviews with the Tekken staff

3546
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Including

3547
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
The screenwriter

3548
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Dai Sato

3549
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
He also was behind Cowboy Bebop

3550
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Is this going to be one of those horrible

3551
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Live events at the theater things

3552
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
That you always see the commercials for

3553
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Like the whole like, see Coldplay

3554
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Take the stage at Madison Square Garden

3555
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
At your local theater

3556
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
It is like one of those

3557
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
No, you get to see the movie

3558
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
No, no, I know, I know

3559
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Don't you ever see the commercials at the movies

3560
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
For these things that are like

3561
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Well those are Fathom events

3562
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
A night at the Metropolitan

3563
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
And they are going to be doing

3564
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
It is the same thing

3565
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
It's very limited theater

3566
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
They've done other anime

3567
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Things like they did the Death Note movie

3568
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
And the live action Death Note movie

3569
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
And stuff like that

3570
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Rob, we went to see Escaflowne

3571
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
I didn't go to that

3572
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I thought you went with us to see Escaflowne

3573
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I remember a bunch of people went to that

3574
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
I've never seen it

3575
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
They'll probably do this with the Try Again movie when it comes out

3576
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I also saw, you know

3577
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I've seen a bunch of movies

3578
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Like I saw Perfect Blue in the theater

3579
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
You went to see Perfect Blue with me, that was it

3580
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
No, I didn't have seen that either

3581
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I don't think, there's not a lot of animes I've seen in the theater

3582
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I saw Howl's Moving Castle

3583
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
You've seen Requiem for a Dream, haven't you?

3584
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
No

3585
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
But that's like Salacious Pop's favorite movie

3586
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Yeah, but the guy was a fan of the director of Perfect Blue

3587
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Oh

3588
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Yeah, anyway

3589
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
He actually fully ripped a scene from it

3590
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,000
There's totally a new Studio Ghibli film coming out in a couple weeks in Japan

3591
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I had no idea

3592
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
There's actually one that just came out already out there

3593
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
But I want it to come out here really desperately

3594
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
It's called Kurigurashi no Arieti

3595
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Which is the borrower

3596
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Arieti from the books The Borrowers

3597
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I think that's, no that's not it

3598
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
A little tiny girl

3599
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Like the Littles

3600
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
And they live in this old house and this sick boy goes live there

3601
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
And he makes friends with her and everything

3602
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
But the soundtrack is done by

3603
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
A Breton singer

3604
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Anyway, I'm sorry, I'm digressing

3605
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
But no, this is

3606
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I'm gonna see the movie

3607
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I really wanna see the movie

3608
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Because I am a huge Tekken fangirl

3609
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
But it's all CG

3610
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
So it's gonna be really cool

3611
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
And it's gonna be on July 26th

3612
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
And then it will be six hours

3613
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Of gorgeous Tekken

3614
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Gooey mess

3615
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
You know what, for OLR's 10th anniversary show

3616
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
I think we should hook up with Fathom Events

3617
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
And make it a one night

3618
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
In the theater special

3619
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
And Dark Soccer will just have to deal with being on the big screen

3620
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I don't know how expensive that is

3621
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
But I know that they do that for riff tracks

3622
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Do they?

3623
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
It's expensive, but I think it's moderately expensive

3624
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Okay, OLR me

3625
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Call your local theater and demand the

3626
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
OLR 10th anniversary special

3627
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
To come to Fathom Events

3628
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
I'll have a mask made

3629
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
That would be weird

3630
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
I don't know

3631
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
We're packing theaters alright

3632
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
You hear what person?

3633
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Now that we've sat you down

3634
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
And you've paid $10 to come see

3635
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Our big mugs in your local movie theater

3636
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
We thought, what should we do that's special

3637
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
For this 10th anniversary show

3638
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Ferret Vision 3D

3639
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
So we're gonna have Extrofer bleaches asshole

3640
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Live right in front of you on the camera

3641
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Who will have an X rating?

3642
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
It'll be made X for

3643
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Extrofer's bleached asshole

3644
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
It'll be like the time that Katie Couric got her colonoscopy

3645
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
On the Today show, come on

3646
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Anyway, in other news

3647
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Resident Evil

3648
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
HD versions are gonna be coming out

3649
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
On Xbox, on Xbox 360

3650
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
We will have Code Veronica

3651
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
X and Resident Evil 4

3652
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
And they will have a thousand

3653
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Achievement points, ooh

3654
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
So

3655
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Yay

3656
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
But it's going to have

3657
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Here's some of the achievements for Code Veronica

3658
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
There's The Terror Begins, Escape from the

3659
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Graveyard of Terror, A Change Father

3660
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Liberate the Change Man

3661
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
There's Once for Encountering Former Stars Captain

3662
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
So basically it's stuff that happens in the game anyway

3663
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Um

3664
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
And uh

3665
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Actually, there's a comparison up

3666
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Of the uh

3667
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
You just have to look around on the internet, but there's a

3668
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Comparison between Resident Evil 4

3669
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
The original, and uh

3670
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
The HD version

3671
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Since I don't have my GameCube hooked up anymore

3672
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Or my, I mean I can always use the Wii, but my friends

3673
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Borrowed Resident Evil 4

3674
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Like, I'm actually really interested in this

3675
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Cause unlike some people in the room, I really liked

3676
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Resident Evil 4

3677
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I didn't dislike Resident Evil 4, but I loved Code Veronica

3678
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
And I liked the second one best

3679
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Ah, alright

3680
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Because the two that were supposed to look like

3681
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Leonardo DiCaprio, totally got killed

3682
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Akuma JP in the chat room

3683
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Is asking, will I be able to save

3684
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Yes

3685
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
You just will not be able to erase those saves

3686
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
As long as you have enough typewriter ribbon

3687
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
That's the

3688
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Perfect answer, DarkSakura

3689
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Perfect answer

3690
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I'm actually going to link the articles in the chat room

3691
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
So people can watch the comparison

3692
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Amazing

3693
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Tweet time! Twitter.com slash

3694
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
OLR if you want to send us your tweets

3695
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
As our listeners do every week

3696
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
And we will go through some of those tweets right now

3697
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
And uh, let's see

3698
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
First off, I want to do a tweet

3699
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
From Mad Gear Store

3700
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Who tweeted a bunch of people

3701
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Who did a nice game selection in California Extreme

3702
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
And tweeted us a picture of some of the

3703
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Um, Bamani that was going up there

3704
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
And I gotta say, I'm actually kinda sad

3705
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I'm actually, well I'm not kind of sad

3706
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I'm really sad that actually I missed California Extreme

3707
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
It just, it was just on a bad

3708
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Weekend this year, I had a lot going on

3709
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
This weekend you guys

3710
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
And I think the others did too, and it's just hard

3711
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I could have gone this morning

3712
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
But I couldn't have justified paying

3713
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
30 bucks and only being there about 4 hours

3714
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Which is what would have happened

3715
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
So I would have wanted to be there yesterday

3716
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Like all night long

3717
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
So, unfortunately I couldn't make that happen

3718
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Blue Swim tweeted us earlier in the week

3719
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Going, I usually listen to podcasts

3720
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
As I'm going to sleep

3721
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Had several episodes of OLR playing

3722
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
And I ended up dreaming about them

3723
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Is that creepy that people like dream of us

3724
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
We didn't hear what was in the dream

3725
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Hopefully it wasn't an erotic dream

3726
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I dare not

3727
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
I don't think it was

3728
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Redertainment sent a tweet earlier

3729
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I actually responded to it, but I wanted to bring it up

3730
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
On the show, and Redertainment asked

3731
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
So when are you going to incorporate

3732
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Google Plus into the show

3733
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
This is the new social network everyone's talking about

3734
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
We like to be on the cutting edge

3735
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Of those types of things

3736
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
As soon as we find a way

3737
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
To do it, we will

3738
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Google has actually asked that small and medium

3739
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Businesses stop making personal profiles

3740
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Because they will roll out

3741
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
A business thing, kind of like how

3742
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Facebook has business pages

3743
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
They're going to roll that out later in the year, I guess

3744
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
So as long as we can do it for free

3745
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Or like, really cheap

3746
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
We're going to look at doing something like that

3747
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Where we can keep our fans posted

3748
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Assuming that Google Plus has something you want

3749
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
And you know, we're gamers like you

3750
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
And if this whole thing ends up being

3751
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Spam, spamity, spam, spam

3752
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
We wouldn't do that, we're not going to contribute to that

3753
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
But, you know, if it's a place where you can

3754
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Be in a community and talk about games

3755
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
And, you know, meet other people that don't want to be

3756
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Jerks on playing online games

3757
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Then I'm all for that

3758
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
But Google Plus, its biggest

3759
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Problem right now is that there's not

3760
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
A lot there, like you can see

3761
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
What they're building, and a lot of people

3762
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Are really liking what they see in the foundation

3763
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
But there's certainly a lot of other people

3764
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Who look at Google Plus and go

3765
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
There's fucking nothing there right now, it's so vanilla

3766
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
So, I think

3767
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Google Plus just needs some time to grow

3768
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
And then we can really see what we can do with it

3769
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Uh, mnziba

3770
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Are you alright there?

3771
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Are you alright? Is a bug attacking you?

3772
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Is a fly attacking you for massive damage?

3773
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Hit its weak point

3774
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
There you go, she got a Kleenex

3775
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
And hit its weak point

3776
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Squished it to death

3777
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
I broke one of its wings

3778
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Yikes, mnziba sends us a tweet

3779
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Saying, this video made me go back to

3780
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
FFXI or Final Fantasy 11

3781
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
How many of these scenes have you seen in game?

3782
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
So I'm looking at a little

3783
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
A little scenery

3784
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
A little quaint scene

3785
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Of plants growing

3786
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I don't know what this is

3787
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
It's supposed to be like a garden, I gotta skip ahead a little bit

3788
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I think it's just some of the

3789
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Pretty shit in game

3790
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Sent to pretty music

3791
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
You know what?

3792
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I gotta say, it's funny

3793
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
You know, you sent this tweet before I told my story

3794
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
At the top of the break about how I got FFXI

3795
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Bought for me, but it actually was

3796
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Thinking about a lot of the great scenery

3797
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
And ambiance in that game

3798
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Despite the dated graphical technology

3799
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
That had me thinking like

3800
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
I wonder what it looks like now

3801
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
I wonder if they've made some changes

3802
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
And why FFXIV was so fucking disappointing

3803
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Because it should have been

3804
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
11 improved in high def

3805
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
But instead it was 11

3806
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Flushed down a toilet in high def

3807
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
And that was what was very disappointing about it

3808
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Redertainment sent us another tweet saying

3809
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
I'd like to start the rumor that the PlayStation 4

3810
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Will feature Body Movin', the hit song

3811
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
From the Beastie Boys

3812
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Get it? Because it rips off the connect

3813
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Get it?

3814
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Spazernator tweets us and says

3815
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
No news on free PlayStation Network videos

3816
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
For a while with the fact that my system being

3817
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Dead and needing to be repaired

3818
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Yeah, I heard about this, I guess he got the yellow

3819
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Lie to death on the PlayStation

3820
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
And he does not have good luck with PlayStation

3821
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Yet he supports someone

3822
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
I know, rude Sony

3823
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Rude, rude Sony

3824
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Sj100matt tweets us

3825
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Has Hollywood really run out of ideas?

3826
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
The Space Invaders movie rights

3827
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Have been optioned

3828
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
And tweets us to a story

3829
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I thought this had already happened some time ago

3830
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
But it's making the rounds again

3831
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
The Taito classic arcade game

3832
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Space Invaders has been optioned

3833
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
By veteran Hollywood producers

3834
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
The film rights were optioned by

3835
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Lorenzo de Beneventura

3836
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Who made Transformers, G.I. Joe

3837
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
and Salt and Odd Lot

3838
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Entertainment who is behind

3839
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Upcoming movies Drive and Ender's Game

3840
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I guess they've

3841
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Also optioned Asteroids

3842
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Ah, I see

3843
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Last year Warner Brothers allegedly

3844
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Was seeking the Space Invaders rights itself

3845
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
But that venture fell through

3846
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Where would you make a fucking

3847
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Movie out of Space Invaders?

3848
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Like, wouldn't it just be Independence

3849
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Day but called Space Invaders?

3850
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Yes, they're never gonna make a better alien

3851
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Film than Independence Day

3852
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
But the soundtrack would be

3853
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

3854
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
No, well, the new Space Invaders game

3855
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Has had fucking rad soundtracks

3856
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Like, that would be cool

3857
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
How about techno rave version of Independence Day?

3858
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
There you go

3859
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Today is our Independence Day

3860
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Ooh, ooh

3861
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
DJ Rama S sent us a tweet

3862
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
About Pac-Man to become a reality show

3863
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Didn't this come up on last week's show?

3864
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I have a little question mark over my head

3865
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
I guess I'll quickly read this

3866
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
But I guess Pac-Man is coming to life with a new

3867
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Reality series

3868
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Merv Griffin Entertainment is developing an unscripted show

3869
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
About the pellet eating yellow blob

3870
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Chased by Inky Binky Pinky and Clyde

3871
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
It's to coincide with the 30th anniversary

3872
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Of the video game

3873
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
It's a big, crazy, wipe out

3874
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Type event with a lot of energy

3875
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
The idea we have is to take what Pac-Man

3876
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Is and bring it to life

3877
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
To bring what is essentially the world's biggest game

3878
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Of tagged television

3879
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Sounds like a game show

3880
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
They say a reality show

3881
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Like a game show

3882
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I consider Wipeout a game show more than a reality show

3883
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
You know

3884
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
At first when I read the headline

3885
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Pac-Man to become a reality show

3886
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Now I hear Pac-Man to become a game show

3887
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
And if it's done right

3888
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
It might actually be kind of cool

3889
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Isn't there some show coming to NBC

3890
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Like take the money and run or something

3891
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
That's supposed to be like people have 48 hours

3892
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
To hide $100,000

3893
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
And if they can keep the money

3894
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Hidden from the feds for 48 hours

3895
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Or something like that like actual federal agents

3896
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
That try to chase them down and the money

3897
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
For themselves because the fed agents are competing

3898
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
For the money like if they can find it in 48 hours

3899
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
And they get to keep it and I'm like that

3900
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Sounds kind of awesome like

3901
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I like shows about like

3902
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
That type of stuff I would do that

3903
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
You would do how would you hide the money

3904
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
How would you win that show

3905
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
You package it up

3906
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Send it second day air

3907
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
To somewhere

3908
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
To your house or something like that

3909
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
But couldn't the federal agents like trace

3910
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Everywhere you've been and your steps

3911
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
And the packages you've sent

3912
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
You immediately invest it

3913
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
You immediately invest the money

3914
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Well I'm sure there's rules

3915
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
You probably have to physically hide the money somewhere

3916
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I'm guessing

3917
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
I don't know it's just something

3918
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Like capturing the concept of the show

3919
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
But I don't know it sounds kind of awesome

3920
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
There was another show I don't think it was out here

3921
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
But I think it was in um

3922
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Britain or something called Jailbreak

3923
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
That was just about like whoever could

3924
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Escape from jail first won like

3925
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Obscene amount of money

3926
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
And who's seen too many Steve McQueen movies

3927
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
I'll tell you what I'm

3928
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Look I'm a game show addict

3929
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
I grew up on like old school match game

3930
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
And USA network game shows like Scrabble

3931
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
And pressure luck and all that shit like

3932
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
That shit was awesome

3933
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
But I'll tell you my favorite reality

3934
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Game show they ever did

3935
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Ever ever it's not

3936
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Survivor it's not Big Brother I think the best

3937
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Like reality game show they ever did was The Mole

3938
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
When it was hosted by Anderson Cooper

3939
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Like back in the day it was like a fucking

3940
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
James Bond game yeah it was like

3941
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Ten players yet one of them

3942
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Fred Savage would show up with a mole on his face

3943
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
No no not that kind of mole I know

3944
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
But one player was working against the other

3945
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Players they brought it back for a revival

3946
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Series a couple years ago but it wasn't as good

3947
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Well then they had the celebrity mole and then they had another

3948
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Real mole but it wasn't as good cause Anderson Cooper

3949
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Like made that show

3950
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Cause he's just the man but it was like James Bond

3951
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
And I would like

3952
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I'd kill someone to be on that

3953
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Show not literally I'd kill a fly like

3954
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Dark Soccer just did I'd do that I didn't just

3955
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Kill it Rob I squished it and pinched it

3956
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
You torched it I hate

3957
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
No I hate flies and now keep in mind I usually comfort myself

3958
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
By saying they'll die in two days anyway because

3959
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
They have a really short lifespan but this

3960
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Fly has been buzzing all over my damn house

3961
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
So I have a feeling of accomplishment

3962
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
And satisfaction and damn it I deserve

3963
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Twinkie

3964
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Alright we have a lot of

3965
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Fucking tweets today but I gotta get through some of these

3966
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Others okay Sturlock tweets us and now

3967
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Remember I said I wanted to hear from blind gamers

3968
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Sturlock I know is a blind gamer and tweets

3969
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Us about the whole glasses story from part A

3970
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
The glasses thing is actually pretty neat

3971
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Don't have enough usable vision

3972
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
For that but like the concept so

3973
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Unfortunately you know it's not

3974
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Gonna work for everybody but

3975
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
It's still cool that it will help

3976
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Some people I think that's still really cool

3977
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
And I think Sturlock sees that too

3978
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Tigerclaw305

3979
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Tweets us saying

3980
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Katamari creator working on a different kind

3981
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Of MMO

3982
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
What kind of MMO would the person behind

3983
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Katamari Demashi make

3984
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Let's see

3985
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Tiny Spec a small developer

3986
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Founded by former Flickr employees

3987
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Wasn't Spec the name of

3988
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Pee Wee Herman's dog

3989
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
In the Pee Wee's Big Adventure movie

3990
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Spec

3991
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Yeah

3992
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I thought you were talking about what was in his pants

3993
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Shut up

3994
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Announced today that

3995
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Takahashi who is

3996
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
The guy behind Katamari

3997
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Demashi moved from Tokyo to Vancouver

3998
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
To contribute to Glitch

3999
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
It's web based MMOs

4000
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Ooh there's even a trailer let's take a look real quick

4001
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
You know he actually got hired to design a

4002
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Playground

4003
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Well yeah I knew he was doing the Playground but

4004
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
I see

4005
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
All these people like little avatars

4006
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
And they're jumping around like

4007
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
It looks like a 2D

4008
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Platformer game

4009
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
There's something

4010
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
LittleBigPlanet-ish about this

4011
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
To me

4012
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
I'm not saying that's what the game is

4013
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
It's just

4014
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:44,000
LittleBigPlanet on mushrooms

4015
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
There was a wheel

4016
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
And I quickly caught the text

4017
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
On that and it said booty prize

4018
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
I said booty

4019
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Anyway

4020
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
It looks a little silly

4021
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
That's kind of cool

4022
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I guess if it's free

4023
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I'll check it out but if it's not

4024
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I'll have to hear more about it

4025
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
To see if it's worth it

4026
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Here's a question from Tigerclaw

4027
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Nintendo researching mobile phone possibilities

4028
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
That's kind of a big deal

4029
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
How did I miss that one?

4030
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Think about it guys

4031
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Let's see

4032
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Satoru Iwata responded to a fantastic question

4033
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Pitched at a recent shareholder Q&A that began

4034
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I own some shares but I do not have any Nintendo products

4035
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Basically I think games are a waste of time

4036
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
And therefore I would like a product that has value

4037
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Added to it so that even I would buy one

4038
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Let's see

4039
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
If we had never considered combining a mobile phone

4040
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
We would be negligent

4041
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
But on the other hand mobile phones are subject to monthly fees

4042
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
And we need to consider how well this would fit with game devices

4043
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Or how we should balance these aspects

4044
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
According to this mobile phone companies

4045
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Are generally divided by countries

4046
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And when running a business on a worldwide basis

4047
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
We need to consider in what conditions

4048
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Can we partner up with mobile phone companies

4049
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Around the world

4050
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Please understand that we are still researching these areas

4051
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I gotta say

4052
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
No disrespect to the tweet

4053
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Or the story or what have you

4054
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
This sounds like a whole lot of nothing

4055
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Absolutely nothing

4056
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
This sounds like Iwata just completely dodging this question

4057
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
He didn't want to tell the guy

4058
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
No we're not doing a fucking mobile phone

4059
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
He just wanted to give this big answer about

4060
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Well if we did that we'd have to do this and this

4061
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
But it's something we're always looking into

4062
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Just say no

4063
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
So that they'll say oh it's something we may be looking into

4064
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
But when it comes to actually you know

4065
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Talking about games that they're porting over

4066
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Oh that no

4067
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
I had my hopes up

4068
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
That this was going to be a story about like

4069
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I don't know Mario Brothers on my iPhone or something

4070
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
How silly of me

4071
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
How silly of me

4072
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
WatchDragon tweets us saying

4073
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Going old school just beat Tyrion

4074
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Does anyone remember Tyrion?

4075
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Anyone?

4076
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
It was an epic mega games shooter

4077
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
From 94

4078
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
And the minute I saw a screen

4079
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
I admit I cheat and I googled it because I'm like what is this

4080
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
And the minute I saw a screenshot I'm like

4081
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
What a fucking game back when it was shareware

4082
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I guess the whole thing was released

4083
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
In 2007 as uh

4084
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Or no Freeware in 04

4085
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
And the graphics are open license

4086
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
As of April of 07

4087
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
That's kind of cool

4088
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Where can you download this game? I'll give a shout out

4089
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
For the download let's see

4090
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Uhhhh

4091
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Official Tyrion repository

4092
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Freewebs.com

4093
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Slash world tree games

4094
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
There you go

4095
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
One more tweet last tweet

4096
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
AlphaCananagram tweets us

4097
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Did y'all talk about Play for Japan coming out today?

4098
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Sorry many distractions on my end today

4099
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Actually we didn't it hasn't come up yet

4100
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
So we should say

4101
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
That the Play for Japan album is out today

4102
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
So if you have not checked it out in iTunes

4103
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
To see if it's something you want to get

4104
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
And help out a good cause

4105
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
You probably should do that after the show

4106
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Play for Japan is out

4107
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
That does it for Twitter tonight

4108
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Twitter.com slash OLR

4109
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Future week back to gaming news

4110
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Loki

4111
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Sorry distracted by a very very strange

4112
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Picture of Katy Perry for some reason

4113
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Why is it that she has like

4114
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
That

4115
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I don't understand it that doesn't make any sense

4116
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Why is she famous?

4117
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
She's famous because she's willing

4118
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
To wear a dress that has

4119
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Whipped cream dispensers

4120
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
On her nipples that is why she is

4121
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Famous

4122
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I gotta admit she does have some good songs

4123
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
I feel like she's a better song writer

4124
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
She does have some good nipples

4125
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
That makes sense

4126
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Nintendo is actually

4127
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
In line again for another lawsuit

4128
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
If it's not motion sensors

4129
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
It's now gonna be 3D

4130
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
So they are facing a lawsuit over

4131
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
The 3DS technology mainly the

4132
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Screen

4133
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Of course a company that you probably never heard of

4134
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Before Tomata Technologies

4135
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Has a patent suit against Nintendo

4136
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Because they have the patent for technology

4137
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Relating to displaying stereoscopic images

4138
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
On screen for viewing with a naked eye

4139
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
I.e. without glasses

4140
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Or other devices

4141
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Filed in 2003 grinded in 2008

4142
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
And of course you know

4143
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
They've run up

4144
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Suits for the Wii Fit

4145
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
GameCube classic controllers

4146
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Control ports etc.

4147
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
The funny thing about this though is

4148
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Nintendo doesn't make those screens

4149
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Sharp does

4150
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Oops

4151
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
So Nintendo licensed

4152
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
The screen technology from Sharp or whatever

4153
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Contracted Sharp to put those screens in

4154
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Yeah

4155
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
And some of the people

4156
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
They were commenting and they were all as expected

4157
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Googled Tomata Technologies

4158
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Feels the only notable thing that they've ever done

4159
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Is sue Nintendo

4160
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Once again one of those patent

4161
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Sniping

4162
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Companies I guess

4163
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Patent trolls I feel like patent trolls need a theme

4164
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Song here on the show

4165
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
We'll look into that for the future

4166
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Anyhow I am glad I waited

4167
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
To buy this game because the new version

4168
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
That's coming out on Playstation Network sounds kinda awesome

4169
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
It's Castlevania Harmony of Despair

4170
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
If you don't remember this game

4171
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
It's the HD Castlevania game that was released

4172
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Almost a year ago on the Xbox 360

4173
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
It's finally coming out to the

4174
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Playstation 3

4175
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
But the good news is your wait may pay off

4176
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Because the PSN version of the game

4177
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
It will come with a new

4178
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Local 4 player cooperative mode

4179
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Including the 6 player online mode

4180
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
There's also going to be the beauty

4181
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Desire situation desire map pack

4182
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
And some extra carriers

4183
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Carriers, characters that will carry

4184
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Whips and other weapons

4185
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Julius Belmont and Yoko Belonades

4186
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
So kinda cool

4187
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
You know I played the demo

4188
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Of this game and I was kinda like

4189
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
But I have a lot of friends that are really into it

4190
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
And I think I need to give it a second chance

4191
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
So I will definitely check it out on PSN

4192
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
So yeah very cool

4193
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Dr. Sakura

4194
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
In other news

4195
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
For fans of Nights like me

4196
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
There is an

4197
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
OC Remix album put out

4198
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
It's called Lucid Dreaming

4199
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
It is a free download

4200
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
And it has

4201
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
25 arrangements

4202
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
And 2 bonus tracks

4203
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
From Nights

4204
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Into Dreams

4205
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
And it's actually put out as an anniversary release

4206
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Because 15 years ago

4207
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
It came out on Sega Saturn

4208
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
So it is available at

4209
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
lucid.ocremix.org

4210
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
And I am

4211
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Going to be downloading the crap out of this when I'm done

4212
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
You love Nights right?

4213
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Oh yeah Nights is fun although it always made me

4214
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Motion sick

4215
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
But yeah it's an overclocked remix

4216
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
The whole album is overclocked so

4217
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
OC Remix has been getting

4218
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
More and more exposure it seems over the years

4219
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Didn't they do the remix soundtrack

4220
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
For the Street Fighter 2

4221
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Remix

4222
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I think they said this is their 26th album

4223
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
That they've done

4224
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Well yeah but this is

4225
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Doesn't this have some type of backing by Sega

4226
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Or no this is just a fan thing

4227
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I think this is just a fan thing

4228
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Oh my bad I thought for some reason it was like an endorsed thing

4229
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Well still really cool yeah

4230
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
No they've done a few fan albums

4231
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Like the Final Fantasy 7 one

4232
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
There was probably several more than one

4233
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
I think there was a Mega Man one too so yeah I'm not surprised

4234
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
That's cool

4235
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
It's under about

4236
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
And uh

4237
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
No it doesn't say that

4238
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
It just says the fan project so

4239
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
I'll link the website in the chatroom

4240
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Alright

4241
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Loki

4242
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
You know

4243
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
It was a matter of time

4244
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
We even hinted that this is something

4245
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
That may happen and sure enough

4246
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Sony has announced

4247
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Or I shouldn't even say they've announced

4248
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
It was mainly found out

4249
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
That they were going to be doing this and then they acknowledged

4250
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Yeah we're doing it

4251
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
There is now going to be a

4252
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
PlayStation network pass on

4253
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
First party games from Sony

4254
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Basically this is just like the other online

4255
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Passes Project 10 dollars

4256
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
What the fuck you want to call it?

4257
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Ripping off people that are buying used

4258
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Pass

4259
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
That will be included starting with

4260
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Resistance 3

4261
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Basically you have to have this network pass in order to play

4262
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Online

4263
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
If you're buying it used

4264
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Since it's a one time use code

4265
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
And the code has been used you have to purchase it

4266
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
For an unset amount of money

4267
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
But I think it's just

4268
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Could it be 10 dollars?

4269
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
It could be 10 dollars

4270
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
It could be 5 dollars

4271
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
That's what other companies are doing

4272
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
I don't like this trend at all

4273
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
I don't know

4274
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
It looks like you may be out of luck Loki

4275
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
It looks like everybody is jumping on board

4276
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
What makes this notable I'm sure in many ways

4277
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
We're not talking a third party developer

4278
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
We're talking fucking Sony's on board

4279
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
With this

4280
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Which is interesting because Sony always made a big deal about how

4281
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
PSN is free

4282
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Yeah it's free if you buy it new

4283
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
But then

4284
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
I don't know it's stupid

4285
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
I'm sorry

4286
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
It's just like if you use it

4287
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
They're using the excuse

4288
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Well if you buy it used

4289
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
The developer doesn't get any of that money

4290
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
No they already got that money when the game was purchased

4291
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
It's just new

4292
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
I don't understand

4293
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
But you should buy all your games new

4294
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Oh it's a stupid argument

4295
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Just like you buy all your CDs new

4296
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Just like how you buy all your clothes new

4297
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
There's no such thing as a thrift store

4298
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Macy's doesn't get money

4299
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
When you buy that used clothes

4300
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
At a garage sale

4301
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Too bad

4302
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Then you need to make your games better

4303
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
So those people think that it's worth paying

4304
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
60 dollars for

4305
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
To drop your prices down

4306
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
To a reasonable amount

4307
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Where people feel it's necessary to buy

4308
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
I'm sorry

4309
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
It's just after all the

4310
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Bullshit that they've done with other things

4311
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
I don't know

4312
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Why people put up with it

4313
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Let me put it this way

4314
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
If you're still interested in playing this game online

4315
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
And buying it new is not for you

4316
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
What I recommend doing is waiting a good year

4317
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Before it drops down in price

4318
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
If that's not good enough for you

4319
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
It's sucker new

4320
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Or just shop around

4321
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
A lot of people drop the prices of those games

4322
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
At launch

4323
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
That entice people to come buy there

4324
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
And so you may be able to find it

4325
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Cheaper than that

4326
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Or if you're in the case of me

4327
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Which I could give a rat's ass about

4328
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Resistance

4329
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
It's multiplayer

4330
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
It wouldn't matter to me either way

4331
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
But once again

4332
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
I'm just not gonna buy it

4333
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
I hope Microsoft is smart

4334
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
And decides not to do this

4335
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
I hope that they say

4336
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Hey you know what

4337
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
We're not gonna jump on this bandwagon

4338
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Because I have a feeling

4339
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
They're either gonna jump on it

4340
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Because everybody else is doing it

4341
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Or they're gonna hold strong and say

4342
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Hey you know what we don't need to do that

4343
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Because it's gonna look really bad

4344
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
If they do it

4345
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Because they're charging for online

4346
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
And then they're charging again

4347
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
For you to get access on

4348
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Nah I don't know

4349
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
That's where I'm kind of at with Dark Toa Gak

4350
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Because I'm like you know

4351
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
I understand why you're pissed off at Sony

4352
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
But I'm a little worried that this is just the first

4353
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Of everybody jumping on board with this

4354
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Of course I don't buy a lot of games

4355
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Used

4356
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
But I kind of like having that option

4357
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Available to me

4358
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Especially when they go out of print

4359
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
It's also rentals

4360
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
If you're going on Gamefly or something like that

4361
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
And you want to play the online portion of this

4362
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Well you're fucking out of luck

4363
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Unless you want to

4364
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Pay ten dollars or whatever

4365
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Alright

4366
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Let's move on

4367
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
I want to talk to you about a Facebook game

4368
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Yes a Facebook game but this is one that's been

4369
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Making a lot of heads turned this week

4370
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Civilization World finally

4371
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Launched on Facebook

4372
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
How do you like that? Remember how I bitched about how I didn't have an invite?

4373
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Well I did get one later that night

4374
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
So thank you Dark Tetsuya for hooking me up with that

4375
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
And not even three days later it went public

4376
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Which is fine

4377
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
At least I got to have a somewhat

4378
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Early look at it

4379
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
But yes Civilization World is a new Facebook game

4380
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
And it's turning a lot of people's heads

4381
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Because a lot of people are going

4382
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
This is a really good game

4383
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
And it's a Facebook game

4384
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
I got to be honest

4385
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
At its core I still feel like

4386
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
There's a lot of elements that make it very

4387
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Facebook-y

4388
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Like the whole, hey do you want to get more harvests

4389
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
In an hour? Give us your money

4390
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Do you want to get more culture generation?

4391
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Give us your money

4392
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Do you want to get extra bonuses and other perks?

4393
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Give us your money

4394
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
So there's a lot of that going on in Civ World

4395
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
But otherwise there are a lot of

4396
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Kind of cool elements to it

4397
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
One of the things I like about it is a Facebook

4398
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Game because I did spend, obviously I spent

4399
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Quite a bit of time with it this week

4400
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
I just neglected to mention it during my gaming week

4401
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Because I was pissed off because I couldn't get in today

4402
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Because they're having a lot of server issues today

4403
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Because I think the game is just too damn popular

4404
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
I think they're crushing under the weight of the popularity

4405
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Of the game

4406
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
But anyhow

4407
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
I was playing some of the game, but one of the things I really like about it

4408
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Is that you work with a nation

4409
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
You can join a nation

4410
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
To kind of better yourselves

4411
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
And you're supposed to be working with these people

4412
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
So that you can

4413
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Beat other nations and you can get the technologies

4414
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
You need to advance yourself as a nation

4415
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
But at the same time

4416
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
You're kind of against these same people

4417
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Because there's also competition

4418
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Going on amongst you guys for

4419
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Who is on top of your nation

4420
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
And whoever is on the top of your nation

4421
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Gets more votes and a bigger say

4422
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
To drive the entire nation

4423
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
So I kind of like that

4424
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Whole teamwork with a knife

4425
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
To your back type of thing

4426
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
There's something about that kind of gameplay

4427
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
That's actually really rad

4428
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
And I think that's the element that this game has

4429
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
That no other Facebook game has

4430
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
And why the rest of it

4431
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
It really has nothing

4432
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
It's not fucking civilization

4433
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I'm sorry, when I played it

4434
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
It has similar music

4435
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
And it has the concepts of

4436
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Trade, science, agriculture

4437
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
And culture

4438
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Really growing a city

4439
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
But after that

4440
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
I don't know, a lot of the similarities

4441
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
To civilization

4442
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Kind of end

4443
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
I guess you still have the science tree

4444
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
There's some really weird minigames that have nothing to do with civilization

4445
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
That doesn't mean I don't like it though

4446
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
I like it

4447
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
If I really want to play civilization

4448
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
I'm going to go back and play Civ 5

4449
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
You know what I mean?

4450
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
This isn't going to get me to quit playing piece of civilization

4451
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Yeah, it's like

4452
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
It's a civilization Facebook game

4453
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
But it's the fact that they've worked so hard on this

4454
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
And that I think Sid Meier

4455
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Is actually involved

4456
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I think led to this whole other angle

4457
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
That Zynga would have never come up with

4458
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I'm sorry

4459
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Is not capable of

4460
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Gaming an invention

4461
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Like this right now

4462
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Because I think they're just all about

4463
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Pushing out

4464
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Clones of what's essentially the same damn game

4465
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Between the mafia wars

4466
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
And the sorority wars

4467
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
And the farmvilles

4468
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
And the cityvilles

4469
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
And whatevervilles

4470
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
So

4471
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
So yeah, Civ world

4472
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
The story is that yes

4473
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
It launched on Facebook

4474
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
So if you are waiting for an invite

4475
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Why wait? Go play

4476
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
The game may be down for maintenance or something though

4477
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
But yeah

4478
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
In some of the reviews I'm hearing

4479
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Is that it has a lot of the just one more turn quantities

4480
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Of civilization

4481
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
And yeah, that's kind of true

4482
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
But there is a point where there isn't a lot to do

4483
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
But hover your mouse over

4484
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Waiting for little bonus

4485
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Science outputs and things like that

4486
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
But I don't know

4487
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I think it's better than most

4488
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Facebook games I've ever played

4489
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
You know what's more fun than a Facebook game though?

4490
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Emails

4491
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
And the emails you send to us every week

4492
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
At mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

4493
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Darzagra is gonna dive

4494
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
In the mailbag right now and read some emails

4495
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
For us to respond to

4496
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
We actually got something from

4497
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Holly

4498
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
About the Commercial Felony Streaming Act

4499
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
So thanks for reporting on this

4500
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
I've contacted my senator and my congressman

4501
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
And sent it on to my friends and family

4502
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Hopefully if everyone tells them no

4503
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
We can get this nonsense blocked

4504
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Bravo, good job

4505
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
That's what everybody should be doing

4506
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
By the way we have a follow up coming later in the show

4507
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
We'll get to it in a minute

4508
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
This comes from Rubba

4509
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Rubba, who I think added me on Steam the other day

4510
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Cool

4511
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
You had a really good caller last week

4512
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Who discussed the kids that were Crestfallen

4513
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
About the closure of Virtual Magic Kingdom

4514
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
You also discussed the Star Wars Momo closing

4515
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
These things are really good lessons

4516
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
To children and adults alike

4517
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
They should learn 1. Everything ends

4518
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Your dog will die, the batteries won't last forever

4519
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
And MMOs or businesses will stop supporting it someday

4520
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
I think this is more for the younger crowd

4521
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
2. Virtual goods are not goods

4522
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
They will someday disappear

4523
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
In an instant when the MMO closes

4524
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
This is why I find

4525
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Placing cash value on gold or items

4526
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
To be an utter waste of time

4527
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Adults still need to learn this lesson

4528
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
3. You will not always

4529
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Get what you want

4530
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
It's funny that many of today's Americans don't understand this concept

4531
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Amen

4532
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
And on the bright side 4

4533
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Something new and shiny will come along

4534
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
To make you forget about the old MMO

4535
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
So there we have it

4536
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Dealing with loss, bubble economies, humility and optimism

4537
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Rubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba

4538
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Things will end and your dog

4539
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Will die

4540
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
This is kind of a Debbie Downer email

4541
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
It's true though

4542
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Your email gets a sad trombone

4543
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
It's true though isn't it?

4544
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
It is but

4545
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
It goes back to my old rant about Americans

4546
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
And this sense of self entitlement

4547
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Everyone thinks that

4548
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Everyone owes them something and they don't want to

4549
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Work for anything and you know what?

4550
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Bite my ass

4551
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Oh except that's too much effort for you to come to my house and bite my ass

4552
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Well what about, well you better be careful

4553
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Because there's some creepsters out there who might actually try to show up at your door

4554
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
And say I'm here to bite your ass ma'am

4555
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
I'll kick her in the balls

4556
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
What if it's a girl?

4557
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
I'll kick her in the clit

4558
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Alright

4559
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
That hurts kind of bad

4560
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
I would imagine

4561
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Anyhow wow I just didn't think you'd say that

4562
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
But what about, okay what about the whole angle of

4563
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
But I paid for stuff in the game

4564
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
And yeah I realize the address is in the email

4565
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
But I don't know like

4566
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I can see the disappointment if you've actually like put money

4567
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
And time into this and then suddenly it's like

4568
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Oh I've pulled the plug

4569
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Well you know what I'll be disappointed and sad when my cat dies

4570
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
I guess you've poured a lot of money into her

4571
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Visits and I've bought that bed down there

4572
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
And I feed her and I take care of her

4573
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
But one day she's gonna go

4574
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
You know I'm very sad I love my cat

4575
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
But you know

4576
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
I've, my computer here

4577
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
I've got all this shit on it

4578
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Grandma and grandpa gonna die

4579
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
But you don't need to tell them that

4580
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Cause they already know

4581
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
I don't know when

4582
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
I don't know how

4583
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:50,000
But one day they gonna die

4584
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,000
But you don't need to tell them that

4585
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
World of Warcraft

4586
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
They know already

4587
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Yeah but I mean seriously

4588
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
You know

4589
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
Your Playstation's gonna break

4590
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
One day

4591
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Ask Spassinator

4592
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
I know yeah Spassinator should know all about that

4593
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Your Xbox is gonna

4594
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Be a bed ring

4595
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
That little beta that you've got

4596
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
In your pot on your desk at work

4597
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Is gonna die

4598
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Well aren't we just a fucking

4599
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
One day your house will burn down

4600
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
And you won't live there anymore

4601
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
No but seriously everything

4602
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Has an end

4603
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Face it

4604
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Just because you liked it and it was fun

4605
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Including OLR

4606
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
No

4607
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Just because you liked it and it was fun

4608
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
And you get to have it forever

4609
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Grow up

4610
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Okay

4611
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Last one

4612
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
And it comes from Robert Mmm

4613
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
I recently picked up Atari's

4614
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Greatest Hits Volume 1 on the DS

4615
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
First major points off for including

4616
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Atari Video Cube instead of Yars

4617
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Revenge. The games do

4618
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Play very well though and although the small screen

4619
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Hurts arcade games such as Gravatar

4620
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
They control pretty spot on to the originals

4621
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
I noticed on the back of the box

4622
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
The proclamation the most popular

4623
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Casual games of all time

4624
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Interesting. Do you consider retro games

4625
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
To be casual you know unless you're

4626
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Steve Weeby or something

4627
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Um

4628
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
They were just different back then

4629
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Interesting. Interesting. I think a lot of retro games

4630
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Are just very simple in concept

4631
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Were they casual? I think a lot of people

4632
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Take a casual approach to it cause I know

4633
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
When you have emulators

4634
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
And you can sample everything at the buffet

4635
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
People will play games for five seconds

4636
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I remember this. Next game

4637
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
I remember this. It's like

4638
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
It's like you lick the vanilla ice cream

4639
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
This tastes good. You lick the chocolate ice cream

4640
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
This tastes good too

4641
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
But back in the day when you would drop

4642
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
$50 on those games like they

4643
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Entertained you for a long time

4644
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Well and I'm gonna

4645
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
I'm actually gonna use a comparison from

4646
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Design theory actually

4647
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Okay

4648
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Back then first of all

4649
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
You didn't have a lot of space to actually

4650
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Game on so you had to do the most you

4651
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Could with the most simple of tools by

4652
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Today's standards right?

4653
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Also we had a longer attention

4654
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Span as people back then

4655
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
I really think so because today

4656
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
I mean we're bombarded

4657
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
With everything and I don't know

4658
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
If you've looked in a magazine from say

4659
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
1970

4660
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
1975

4661
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
And looked like at an article

4662
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
For like pantyhose

4663
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
And it has this big long description

4664
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Of why you want to use legs

4665
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
And all of this stuff

4666
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
And they really a lot of text a lot of

4667
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Information on there and now

4668
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
An ad is usually just a picture of

4669
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
A face or a leg

4670
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
And legs

4671
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Buy it

4672
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Or if it's like a

4673
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Catalog for Abercrombie and Fitch

4674
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
It's just naked

4675
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Good looking 20 year olds

4676
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Butts but it's to sell

4677
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Clothes and they sell clothes through

4678
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Nudity

4679
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Where it's like

4680
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
You pull up a 50's ad for the toasters

4681
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
And it's like this makes some fucking

4682
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Amazing toast and the toast will brown

4683
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Just right and Mrs. Cleaver

4684
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Loves it and she uses this toaster every day

4685
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
This toaster really gets my

4686
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Toast buttered and I love this toaster

4687
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
And it's economical and it looks great

4688
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
In the kitchen

4689
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
In fact I actually remember recently

4690
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Seeing an article for like these

4691
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Ugly ass plaid bell bottom pants

4692
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
In the 70's and it said

4693
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Like something

4694
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Stretch fiber pants for today's modern

4695
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Man these type of pants are for the

4696
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Man who wants to get up and put on his pants and

4697
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Go and it was really

4698
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Describing it you know like you were watching

4699
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
A TV commercial or something

4700
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Well even television commercials now are pretty

4701
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Simple to the point you know

4702
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Because our attention

4703
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
To pants are shorter we are bombarded

4704
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
With so much information

4705
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
And it just gets to be more

4706
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
It's gonna be like our photo albums in the future

4707
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Are gonna be like from The Last Starfighter

4708
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
When the dude shows the little square

4709
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
And it's like 50 million pictures all at once

4710
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
When dude's got here's my photo

4711
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
There's them and them

4712
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Well wouldn't that just be like one of those digital picture frames

4713
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Yeah except it does

4714
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
A photo a second

4715
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Actually I think it did like a photo every half

4716
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Second or something but still

4717
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
The point is is that we had longer

4718
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
Attention spans back then and I think a little bit

4719
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
More in the way of determination we were satisfied

4720
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
With less because back then

4721
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
That was our big thing

4722
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
And then it keeps pushing

4723
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
The envelope and pushing the envelope and now we have

4724
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Such high expectations

4725
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
That

4726
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Really if it

4727
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
You know doesn't hit that

4728
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Factor where it's gonna something's gonna change

4729
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
Every five seconds and hold your attention

4730
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
That's exactly what's gonna happen you're gonna lose

4731
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Interest in it and you're gonna move on

4732
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Speaking of which let's get to the next email

4733
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
There's no more emails

4734
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
No more

4735
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
We're out of email

4736
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
And just like that the mailbag segment

4737
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Has died this week

4738
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4739
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
If you want to contribute to next week's mailbag

4740
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:26,000
In the meantime let's get to some FUs of the week

4741
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:30,000
I don't really have an FU actually

4742
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Ok FU to alcohol for making my face break out

4743
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Loki?

4744
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:40,000
I don't have a lot of FUs because I'm coming off a high

4745
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Of a really really great weekend

4746
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:46,000
But I will say I did have a really bad day this week

4747
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Where just a lot of stuff was going on

4748
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Most of it was work related

4749
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
And then of course everything that I talked about on wow

4750
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Like and it's kind of funny

4751
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Like I think I took it out on this week's

4752
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Episode of Horde House because

4753
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
You know a lot of my guildies that um

4754
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
I've been playing with for you know a couple years now

4755
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Actually a lot of them listen to the show

4756
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
And I actually was getting text messages from people going

4757
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:10,000
God you are so cunty on this week's Horde House

4758
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
And I'm like I was having a bad day

4759
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:15,000
And I got home at 5.55 and the show had to start at 6

4760
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
What do you want from me?

4761
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
But otherwise things are fucking fantabulous

4762
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
And I had an amazing weekend

4763
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:28,000
And I it just it erased the memory of my bad day

4764
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:31,000
Except for the fact that I did remember it to rant about it

4765
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
But now it's done I'm done

4766
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
We're not done with the news yet though

4767
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
We have a few more stories for you guys

4768
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
And then the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR

4769
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio

4770
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
We're not there quite yet

4771
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:46,000
By the way I've kept Twitter open in another window

4772
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
And we got another tweet that came in real quick

4773
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:53,000
From Zether77 tweeted us saying

4774
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
You can also get Tyrion

4775
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Cause we mentioned that game earlier on good ol' games

4776
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
GOG

4777
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
I was not aware but now I am

4778
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
I wonder how much I'll have to check that out

4779
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Let's get to a couple more news stories for you guys

4780
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:10,000
We talked about last week said that Bill 978

4781
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Where it may affect gameplay videos on YouTube and stuff like that

4782
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,000
So if you uploaded pictures of yourself playing a game or something like that

4783
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:24,000
And showing the gameplay that that may be considered copyrighted acts

4784
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:29,000
And that you'd be basically slapped with a felony charge

4785
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
And jail time

4786
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Apparently though the way the bill is worded now

4787
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:37,000
They're saying that it's actually may not be the case

4788
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Basically the statue can only be enforced in instances

4789
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Where uploaders are willfully infringing on the copyright

4790
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
With the intent to make money

4791
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:49,000
And is only punishable if said uploader makes

4792
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Or the game company loses over $2500

4793
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:57,000
And that's probably not gonna be the case for most walkthroughs and stuff like that

4794
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Doesn't totally change my opinion

4795
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
I still think it's stupid

4796
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:05,000
I think this report that you're giving us

4797
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:08,000
I mean don't blame you I know you're getting it from a game blog somewhere

4798
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
And what folks are reporting on the web

4799
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
But it's a little bit smoke and mirrors to me

4800
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
Because I don't think it detracts from the real issue

4801
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:17,000
That okay well where as a lot of individuals

4802
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
What about the middle man

4803
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:24,000
You know review companies from businesses that are not IGN one up etc

4804
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:27,000
But you know still need those hits

4805
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:31,000
I mean for me this is really bad for small business

4806
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Yeah cause I mean they say oh well you know

4807
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
Unless the company loses over $2500

4808
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Yeah but you know these RIA

4809
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:42,000
The RIA said that oh these record companies have lost millions of dollars

4810
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
From one MP3 download

4811
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
So you know they can make that shit up

4812
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Off the top of their heads

4813
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:53,000
So you know why not say oh yeah this YouTube video of some of the gameplay streaming

4814
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
That cost us so much money

4815
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Or what if you had

4816
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
How can you prove that a YouTube lost $2500

4817
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Exactly

4818
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Couldn't a game company say because you gave my game a negative review

4819
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
We lost all these sales

4820
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:09,000
Everybody that watched your thing was a potential sale

4821
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:12,000
I mean that seems so vague and rude this is a shittily written law

4822
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:15,000
Just like I said last week and yes I used that word last week and I'm using it again

4823
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Shittily

4824
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
Shittily's law

4825
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Yeah it's not

4826
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Not good

4827
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:31,000
Hey let's talk about origin vs steam and some of the follow ups to that

4828
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:34,000
I teased this a little bit before and after this story we'll get into your calls

4829
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:39,000
A forum post was posted by EA senior vice president of global e-commerce

4830
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Saying that gamers should be able to buy EA titles on any site they want including steam

4831
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
But here's the thing

4832
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:50,000
I guess what happened is that the crisis 2 disappearing from valve service

4833
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Was the result of a business deal

4834
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Where certain DLC for the game couldn't appear on steam

4835
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:59,000
So valve removed the title completely

4836
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Basically valve is like you know because

4837
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Valve wants to facilitate all the downloads and patches within its own system

4838
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Which for us the consumer I think is really good

4839
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
That's why a lot of us like steam

4840
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:13,000
But EA is like no we want control of that

4841
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
So now there's a power struggle going on here

4842
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Well anyhow the forum post went on to say that the origin platform is a choice for game buyers

4843
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Not an exclusive outlet for all the publishers content going forwards

4844
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:27,000
EA is working to integrate more and more between the game and origin

4845
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
According to the post

4846
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:32,000
I'm absolutely not at this point saying hey it's origin versus steam

4847
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
It's never been about that

4848
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:38,000
I don't know if I totally believe that but we'll see

4849
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:43,000
EA wants to continue offering our games for sale on all major download sites

4850
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:46,000
However you say that on one hand and then on the other hand

4851
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:50,000
Didn't they announce that star wars the old republic will only be on the new EA store

4852
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:54,000
So already there is a contradiction in your post

4853
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:58,000
So it makes me a little bit apprehensive to believe anything else you're saying

4854
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Anyhow EA posted some digital retailers that are going to be carrying battlefield 3

4855
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
And guess who's not on it

4856
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Yeah it's totally not origin versus steam

4857
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:13,000
It has nothing to do with trying to crack things up

4858
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:17,000
It's because they're really trying to offer download content on their own

4859
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:20,000
And steam is being so bad and not letting them do that

4860
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:24,000
I don't know who to root for in this case

4861
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:28,000
There is a part of me that's like well you know if EA really wants that

4862
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Why does steam need that

4863
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:34,000
But I guess that's part of what steam kind of sells itself on

4864
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Is that all the patching and stuff goes through us

4865
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:40,000
So if your server goes down EA and the game can't patch

4866
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:44,000
We're not dealing on our promise as steam

4867
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
I think that makes sense

4868
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:49,000
It does but I am a little bit torn

4869
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:54,000
I also see where EA says but I shouldn't have to every time we want to roll out a patch or something

4870
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
Get permission from steam to do it

4871
02:49:56,000 --> 02:50:01,000
I don't think they need permission but I think that they need to host those files on steam

4872
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:05,000
I think they're just throwing a little hissy fit because they can't make

4873
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:10,000
I don't think they like the fact that steam is taking some of their money for the download content

4874
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
And they want all of it

4875
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Really

4876
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:14,000
I'm sorry go ahead

4877
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:15,000
That's what it sounds like to me

4878
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Really interesting feedback in the chat room and check which way this is tilting so far

4879
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Let's see Zether in our chat says they aren't putting Battlefield 3 on steam because of the DLC clause as well

4880
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Not gonna buy from EA again

4881
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Act F says screw EA

4882
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Kaijuto says Valve you guys are better than EA tell EA to fuck off

4883
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
And Randy says agreed fuck EA

4884
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
And DDR dollar bill says fuck EA

4885
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:45,000
So there's a pretty I mean looking at the fans most people seem to be on team valve

4886
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:48,000
It chatters is anybody team EA?

4887
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Curious?

4888
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:54,000
There's a lot of it says or by or um Rama says buy used

4889
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:58,000
Or or I don't think you can buy used PC product really

4890
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Or you just go out to the store and buy it

4891
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:05,000
I mean you don't need that digital copy you can just go buy it at a store

4892
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:09,000
There you go or just buy a console version

4893
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Some other things on the whole origin stuff

4894
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:19,000
One other thing I want to mention is about the origin is actually coming to the iPod iPhone and Android

4895
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:23,000
There's a cross-platform Scrabble game coming for free to Android

4896
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Yay

4897
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:27,000
So I mean that to be fair that is something that steam doesn't do

4898
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Steam doesn't deal in the iPad iOS universe right now

4899
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:36,000
There's a part of me though that's like well how does that work because I thought Apple had the exclusive stuff on that

4900
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:39,000
Like I thought you had to do everything through Apple

4901
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:45,000
So how do you launch a new store unless it's like the origin app that has all these mini games that you can buy within it

4902
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Like that has to be what it is

4903
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Yeah

4904
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Right? Interesting

4905
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:54,000
EA did demo the mobile offering the origin Apple let you see your friend list

4906
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Which I'm assuming is across the computer and the phone

4907
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:04,000
The accompanying news feed and sharing what everybody is doing on origin no matter what platform that they're on

4908
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:08,000
There's a new version of need for speed on iOS and it was launched from origin

4909
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:11,000
And origin pushes your friend's leaderboard data into the game

4910
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:16,000
And they said at EA that this was not possible before origin

4911
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Hmm

4912
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Well they can say whatever they want but I mean I think you know it's possible

4913
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Look at you know Open Faint

4914
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Yeah but Open Faint isn't really a app it's a enhancement to existing apps

4915
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:40,000
Yeah but they're saying that it's no it wasn't possible to be able to share leaderboard data without EA's you know origin thing

4916
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
But that's bullshit because

4917
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
There's game center

4918
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:49,000
There's game center and there's Open Faint and I'm sure that other people can find ways to do stuff like that

4919
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:54,000
I mean whatever fine PR spin

4920
02:52:54,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Gamer girl in chat says only for sims but otherwise EA stands for eat ass as in EA eats ass

4921
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Rama says I liked EA better when they were known as electronic arts

4922
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:11,000
I liked EA better when they were ECA

4923
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
Want to go back in time a little bit

4924
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Check out some of the loading screens on my favorite Commodore 64 games like pinball construction set was an ECA game

4925
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Did anybody ever play pinball construction set?

4926
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
That game was fucking rad

4927
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:27,000
No

4928
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:30,000
Anyhow

4929
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:35,000
That's it let's take some calls 1877 game OLR our username on skype is orange lounge radio

4930
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:40,000
The skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight on the show

4931
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Or something else that you think we haven't covered yet

4932
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Skypline is open

4933
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:48,000
While we wait for some calls thanks to the delay Loki have any last minute stories for us

4934
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Yeah sure one of the things that came out this week was kind of cool is they had a mod for Call of Duty modern warfare

4935
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:02,000
That basically turned it into a version of like battlefront so you can actually go check that out

4936
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:08,000
It's a thing they're calling it star what was the actual I can't remember the hell they called it now

4937
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:17,000
It's like a some Star Wars game I gotta find the damn link now

4938
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:25,000
It looked neat though I mean I basically look like battlefront so whenever that actually makes its way out

4939
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:28,000
But it's finally done you can actually download it for free

4940
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
This is one of the hosted mods

4941
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Yay free

4942
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Exactly

4943
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:39,000
I guess they're selling 8-bit glasses now they kind of look stupid if you ask me

4944
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Yeah I saw him too and I was like meh

4945
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:47,000
I see that they have an app remember we were saying that that might happen or something like that but the free to be kicked

4946
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:52,000
It was you know for the people they're playing free to play team fortress 2 that they get kicked

4947
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:57,000
Yeah that was that and I was saying that's everything that's wrong with gaming culture but yeah

4948
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Yeah that kind of sucks

4949
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Let's see here if I can find this here ah there we go Galactic Warfare is what it was

4950
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:21,000
And you can find that on the ModDB website

4951
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:30,000
Let's see here yeah moddb.com just search for the Star Wars Galactic Warfare mod for Call of Duty 4

4952
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Looks pretty awesome

4953
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Let's see what other stuff we could talk about here

4954
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Again Skyplane is open 1877 game OLR username on skype is orange lounge radio we'll give it another couple minutes

4955
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Maybe nobody wants to call tonight then it's fine we've had a long show

4956
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Zether in our chat says apparently Sega may not be releasing the second Phantasy Star PSP game or Valkyria Chronicles 3 here

4957
02:55:54,000 --> 02:56:00,000
Yeah I was reading about that second Phantasy Star PSP game but I'm more looking forward to this whole Phantasy Star Online 2

4958
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:03,000
Remember? That's still coming

4959
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
I want to try it out

4960
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:06,000
Me too

4961
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Zether says that's possibly due to piracy causing poor sales

4962
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Yeah but there's piracy in other countries as well as just here I think it's just because their games aren't selling well over here versus Japan

4963
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:23,000
Could it also be that you know the PSP is kind of on its way out so you really have to evaluate what you're going to put on the PSP

4964
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:28,000
Yeah they probably don't want to pay to localize it so it makes sense I guess

4965
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Xbox Live Indie games creators are expressing their disappointment with the low sales on the service

4966
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:45,000
They say that there's not enough exposure for their games and like for example there was sequence which sold around 2000 copies

4967
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:52,000
And they say that's kind of a flop and he's looking at the PC and mobile platforms for future projects

4968
02:56:52,000 --> 02:57:01,000
It's not financially viable to do a large scale project and not expect with any certainty to make some money on the indie marketplace

4969
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Also they said that Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World both pretty well known games on the marketplaces

4970
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:16,000
Sold 50,000 and 16,000 copies each respectively making them relative hits for indie games

4971
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:22,000
I think that our games could sell a lot better than they did with a better platform, more visibility

4972
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:28,000
And he's testing that by releasing both of them on Steam on July 13th for $3

4973
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Hey the phone's finally lighting up let's see who's on the other line

4974
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

4975
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:34,000
Legend of Zaku here

4976
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Hey buddy how you doing?

4977
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Nothing much just like relaxing

4978
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:39,000
I miss New York

4979
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:48,000
I miss New York for tomorrow, granted I had like a nasty weekend of just working, yes I had to show up to work on a Saturday

4980
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Working on the weekend, well life sucks I've had to work on Saturday too

4981
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:56,000
Yeah I'm gonna need you to come in on Saturday

4982
02:57:56,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Yeah I think my boss was jokingly referring to that, he did the Bill Lumbergh voice

4983
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Oh great, well at least he had a sense of humor about it

4984
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:12,000
Yeah but at least it got done yesterday and at least I'm relaxing today

4985
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:13,000
Nice

4986
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:25,000
So basically, yeah that whole EA Origin thing I kind of like killed any and all motivation for me to actually upgrade my PC

4987
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:32,000
It's like I was betting the barn on Battlefield 3 showing up on Steam but because of this shit

4988
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:44,000
I don't know it's like on one hand I have like almost 4 year old hardware but on the other I have no games that I'm looking forward to to justify it

4989
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:48,000
And I'm not talking about Modern Warfare 3 because that's a non-starter

4990
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:53,000
That game is like I'm not gonna jump on that hype bandwagon, I was banking on Battlefield 3

4991
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:59,000
But if they pull out some bullshit copy protection stuff that's gonna turn me off

4992
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:05,000
It needs to be like Steam where even though there is copy protection it doesn't feel like it

4993
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:09,000
It's oblivious to the user and that's how it should be, it should be non-intrusive

4994
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
Agree, agree

4995
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:16,000
But we don't know how Origin's gonna play out because it used to be known as download manager

4996
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:22,000
And even then they still had plenty of copy protection on the games they sold through that one

4997
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:29,000
That's, you know, one reason I truly think crisis was like completely plagued with it, I wanted to buy crisis

4998
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:30,000
Hold on Zaku, Zaku

4999
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
You're wrong, basically stop me, I don't want that shit

5000
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:40,000
Zaku, I really think that the reason people are all over Steam doesn't even have to necessarily do with its interface and all of that

5001
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:46,000
I think it's honestly the crazy fucking deals they have on there, I don't think anybody would have given Steam a second look otherwise

5002
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
I think it would have been about as popular as X-Fire

5003
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:56,000
It can be true because they can, like, you know, these past couple of weekends they had their annual summer sale

5004
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:01,000
So, I mean, yeah, sure, I took advantage of it by getting Call of Duty 4 for 10 bucks

5005
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Dude, Zaku, hold on, I want to say something

5006
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:06,000
Do you remember X-Fire?

5007
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:12,000
Um, I, faintly, I think I've seen him in certain episodes from time to time

5008
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:15,000
Here's the thing, no, no, it's not a user, it's an actual program

5009
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:21,000
And I think MTV Games bought them, thinking it was going to be the next big thing

5010
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:24,000
Steam blew that program out of the fucking water

5011
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:32,000
Because what they did is they took a lot of the things that X-Fire brought to the table and built a store around it that had killer deals

5012
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:37,000
Okay, yeah, I think I remember, I may have dabbled with this a while ago

5013
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:44,000
But you're right, it's like, yeah, Steam pretty much consolidates everything into one app

5014
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
Into one, like, interface

5015
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:52,000
Like, obviously the friends list and the browser just, like, overlay on top of the game in the background

5016
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:56,000
My point is, Steam didn't really bring anything new to the table

5017
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
It just made it, it's like Apple

5018
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:01,000
Yes, it brought it to the table extremely well

5019
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:05,000
Kind of like a lot of Microsoft products, like the Xbox

5020
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:12,000
Well, it's more like Apple, like, taking something that already exists but marketing it well to the point where they make money

5021
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:16,000
And that's what Steam did, they know how to market something like that

5022
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
Something that gamers would want to go after

5023
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:24,000
My point is that Origin, we don't really know what it's bringing to the table yet

5024
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:29,000
Like, a lot of people, I think, are Team Steam in this, including myself

5025
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:34,000
Because we don't really fully understand why EA wants full control of this

5026
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:41,000
I mean, the way I see it is that, to them, Origin is something that's completely out of place to their norms

5027
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:45,000
Case in point, Steam, it's something that they feel comfortable with

5028
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:50,000
If you throw in Origin, it's something that hasn't been proven, it's not tried and true yet

5029
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:53,000
And it's something that EA is still working on, it's still in its infancy

5030
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:57,000
So it's really, it's the uncertainty that Origin brings to these guys

5031
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:01,000
To these people that are very, you know, that are hesitant about it

5032
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:04,000
And that's what's causing the rift and backlash

5033
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
You know, in my honest opinion

5034
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:12,000
It's like, I know Battlefield 3 will be an awesome game, but the way that the distribution is like

5035
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:16,000
That plays an integral role in the fact that it can make or break their sales

5036
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:23,000
You don't want somebody downloading a lemon, which is gonna be useless if it's locked down pretty tight

5037
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:26,000
You know, to the point where only pirates will have the best experience

5038
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:32,000
Well, I agree, the thing about Origin is that the first copy protection or whatever type of mistake they make will kill them

5039
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:40,000
And this is the interesting thing about new technologies, is that the first mistake, if they make it early on, will murder them

5040
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
Case in point, Google Buzz

5041
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Google Buzz was murdered by what they did with the privacy thing

5042
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:52,000
If they screw up to the point where it makes Steam look, you know, really

5043
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:56,000
It reaffirms that Steam is the only choice, then that's it

5044
03:02:56,000 --> 03:03:03,000
Then EA basically has like a walking dead man right there in Origin

5045
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:11,000
The way that Origin can not only be on par if not maybe outdo Steam

5046
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:16,000
Is try to bring something that hasn't been, you know, first of all they have to

5047
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:25,000
One, make sure that the copy protection is not oblivious and more importantly, not obstructive to the user

5048
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:32,000
The second point is they have to do something unique that differentiates themselves from Steam

5049
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:38,000
Aside from what Steam has already done, I'm pretty certain that they're gonna have all the social aspects

5050
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:41,000
It needs to show me what is worth leaving Steam for

5051
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:48,000
And if they can't produce killer fucking deals that convince me to drop $40 on a bunch of games I'll probably end up only playing once

5052
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
Then I'm not so sure they're gonna come out ahead

5053
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:56,000
They need to have a contingency plan if Origin for some reason fails

5054
03:03:56,000 --> 03:04:00,000
Then they're right back where they were a year ago

5055
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
They'll be fine

5056
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:06,000
I understand, I understand, I'm not talking about right now but more long term

5057
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:09,000
They need to have some sort of contingency plan in place

5058
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:16,000
I'm pretty certain Valve has something in place if, should Steam ever fail and they would have to like, you know, wind down

5059
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:23,000
Because they're gonna see a lot of piss off people where their digital content is not worth jack and they can't hold on to it

5060
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:29,000
Remember, the content is only as good as the service that's keeping it, that's backing it up

5061
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:32,000
That allows you, that enables you to actually play it

5062
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:38,000
Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go but before I let you go, I am getting a request from chat

5063
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:41,000
No

5064
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:48,000
I can counter that with the...

5065
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:51,000
Alright, Zaku, thanks for your call

5066
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
Alright

5067
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:56,000
Nyan

5068
03:04:56,000 --> 03:05:02,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

5069
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:07,000
What do you think about EA vs. Steam and all this stuff? Let us know

5070
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Meanwhile, do we have more last minute stories or did you burn them all?

5071
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:16,000
I burned them all

5072
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:17,000
Good job, Loki

5073
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:18,000
They burned on a fire

5074
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:19,000
Good job

5075
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:24,000
Alright, so what's this, are we ready to announce what you're working on over there or do you need more time?

5076
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:30,000
Because it did come to my attention that, you know, OLR does try to be on the cutting edge of like a bunch of social eds

5077
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:34,000
But there was one that we've all been using that we're not using at OLR yet

5078
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:38,000
I'll go ahead and tell everybody but I'm still working on the theme

5079
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:41,000
We have a Tumblr now, there will be stuff on it

5080
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
We're hipster

5081
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
We'll post it with lots of pictures from Reddit

5082
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:50,000
Tumblr is a really easy way to like cross post stuff and a lot of people, it's like it's...

5083
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:51,000
It's the ultimate photo blog

5084
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:57,000
It's MAME central, like when somebody sees something funny, they just posted their Tumblr, no words, no...

5085
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:01,000
Well, you can post words like quotes and things, just pictures and stuff

5086
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
And videos, but you can actually use it as a regular blog

5087
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
Yeah, some people will want to follow that

5088
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:06,000
We'll see what happens

5089
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:07,000
Alright, let's go to the phone and take another call

5090
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

5091
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:10,000
Hey, hey, it's Ronma

5092
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:11,000
Hi, what's up buddy?

5093
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:14,000
Not much, well, I have some interesting news to tell

5094
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:15,000
Oh boy

5095
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
Oh no, you'll like it

5096
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:18,000
Okay

5097
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:21,000
I am getting a Playstation 3

5098
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:24,000
Yes! Why are you getting a Playstation 3?

5099
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:29,000
Because a friend of mine is selling his first gen for 130 bucks

5100
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:30,000
That's a good price

5101
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
That is a good deal, especially because it's first gen

5102
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:35,000
Wow! That's a low price

5103
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:40,000
Yes, do you really think Sony's gonna pull $325 out of my broke ass?

5104
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:41,000
I don't think so

5105
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Yeah, I gotta say, I would buy that too

5106
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:47,000
First gens are better anyways because they have full backwards compatibility

5107
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:51,000
I use mine to the fullest by not playing any Playstation 2 games

5108
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
God, I wish...

5109
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
You know, I know there's some people that would look at me and go

5110
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:58,000
Why don't you just get a PS2 if you wanna play PS2 games?

5111
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:01,000
But I can't tell you, having owned all the fucking consoles I do

5112
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:06,000
I can't tell you how fucking convenient it is to have multiple in one box

5113
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:12,000
Like, I really wish I lived in a world where the Wii, the 360 and the Playstation 3 were just one fucking console

5114
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:16,000
Like, why can't I have this in life?

5115
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:19,000
So

5116
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:24,000
But you know what the funny thing is? You know what the reason why I'm really getting a PS3?

5117
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Because Joe Dave told me that they released the Goonies 25th anniversary edition on Blu-ray only

5118
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:36,000
At that point I was like, yeah, I gotta get a PS3 now

5119
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:37,000
That is pretty awesome

5120
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
My husband says that's inaccurate

5121
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
Oh, it is, it's inaccurate

5122
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:42,000
Wait, what?

5123
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:45,000
Dan? Dan!

5124
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:46,000
Explanation!

5125
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:48,000
Oh, he says it's coming to DVD too

5126
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:51,000
It's also on DVD

5127
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:56,000
Well, the fact that I heard that first, I'm like, well, for me that's not a reason to get a PS3

5128
03:07:56,000 --> 03:08:00,000
I don't know what it is since most of my games are on the 360

5129
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:01,000
My question is this

5130
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
Demon's Souls and LittleBigPlanet

5131
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:04,000
Oh my god, LittleBigPlanet

5132
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:07,000
Yes, Dan is correct, I just double checked on Amazon

5133
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
Both are available

5134
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
You were lied to

5135
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
By a lying liar

5136
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
I'll pistol whip her later

5137
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
Alright

5138
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:18,000
With love

5139
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:21,000
Alright, any other thoughts, Raman, before I let you go?

5140
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:25,000
I want to know what game should I get for my PS3

5141
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
I want to pick from all three of you

5142
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:30,000
You absolutely need LittleBigPlanet

5143
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
Absolutely the must-have game on PlayStation 3

5144
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,000
Dark Soccer?

5145
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:38,000
Dance is infamous

5146
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:39,000
Loki?

5147
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
I would do Resistance

5148
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:44,000
You can probably pick up, they have the Resistance dual pack now

5149
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:48,000
With one and two in there, just pick that up and it's a good time

5150
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:49,000
There you go

5151
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:50,000
Works for me

5152
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:53,000
Alright, well have fun with your PS3 and add me, kay?

5153
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:54,000
I will, dude

5154
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:55,000
Alright

5155
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:56,000
Alright

5156
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:57,000
Bye

5157
03:08:57,000 --> 03:09:00,000
1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio

5158
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:04,000
I guess we can fit in one more call, one quick little call

5159
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:08,000
See, it does suck because I do have to still pick up Infamous, or not Infamous, Resistance

5160
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:14,000
I actually have Infamous now, I have the download mark for my PS3 from me, welcome back

5161
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:15,000
And I have number two

5162
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:20,000
Although I'm probably going to sell number two because I don't know if I'll really get into the series

5163
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:23,000
Randy in our chatroom says, quick, back out of the purchase, Raman

5164
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:27,000
Yeah, back out so I can buy it

5165
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:31,000
Although that would be a waste of money because I really do have a PS2 already and all that good stuff

5166
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
Alright, I guess we have time for one more call, let's take this

5167
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

5168
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
Hi, this is Spaznator

5169
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
Hey Spaznator, what's up buddy?

5170
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:47,000
Well, two things, just in reference to the last call that you just had

5171
03:09:47,000 --> 03:10:00,000
If I were to recommend any games for the PS3, aside from a little bit playing what you already mentioned

5172
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:10,000
I would probably go with the Resistance games, those are pretty good

5173
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:14,000
I want to say this though real fast, Rama if you have the money just do LittleBigPlanet 2

5174
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:18,000
Because all the old LittleBigPlanet levels you can play in LittleBigPlanet 2

5175
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:22,000
Meaning the created levels online, just so you know

5176
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:31,000
I hate to say it because you guys know I've been a really big supporter of PlayStation 3 and all that

5177
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:38,000
I know, and you're that abused significant other that keeps coming back

5178
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:44,000
I'm practically Sony's red-headed stepchild right now

5179
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:53,000
Since March of last year I have had three PlayStation 3's get the yellow lighted up

5180
03:10:53,000 --> 03:11:01,000
Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that I got so much money invested in the system

5181
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:05,000
In terms of downloadable games and of course the videos

5182
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:13,000
I've got to ask this though Spaznator, is there anything you think there might be about how you use your PlayStation 3

5183
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:18,000
I have to ask it, that could be contributing, like do you leave it in a poorly ventilated place

5184
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:24,000
Do you use the thing so much that it just can't handle it, is it on all day

5185
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:27,000
I don't know, I'm trying to think, just what could be your luck

5186
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:33,000
The only thing I could come up with that could possibly factor into it

5187
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:43,000
Is that my entire building as a whole is practically hotter than a hemorrhoid on Satan's ass during the summertime

5188
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:49,000
I mean, you know, at least in terms of my particular place

5189
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:59,000
I store my system, normally try to keep it ventilated at least 10 inches on each side

5190
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:06,000
For ventilation and all that, but during the summertime the building just gets hot

5191
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:10,000
But that can't totally factor into it

5192
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:18,000
Because my system got the yellow lighted up twice last spring

5193
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:23,000
And my building doesn't even get hot during the spring

5194
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:26,000
In fact it's practically freezing cold during the spring

5195
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:30,000
Let me ask this, because this is the question that the chatters are dying to know the answer to

5196
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:38,000
Are you breaking up with Sony, is this it, are you saying Sony, I want to see someone else and her name is Microsoft

5197
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:46,000
I'm severely tempted to, the only reason I'm intentionally having my system fixed

5198
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:49,000
Is what I was starting to see a minute ago

5199
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:56,000
Is that I have so much money invested in downloadable games, the DLC and the videos

5200
03:12:56,000 --> 03:13:00,000
I just hate to see myself lose access to that

5201
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:06,000
Stuff that I already bought or got for free up until now

5202
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:11,000
At least for a tiny baby until if I do get it fixed

5203
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:20,000
I've been playing my 360 lot along with WoW since I just started WoW like a week or two ago

5204
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:26,000
But it just killed me that the system just died plus

5205
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:32,000
Now what little money I have coming soon was already earmarked for something else

5206
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:37,000
And now I have to scrounge up money to get my system fixed

5207
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:44,000
And rearrange my plans and stuff like that, so it's a pain in the watch

5208
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:49,000
Well, keep us posted on what happens in this ongoing saga

5209
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:54,000
And good luck, maybe see if Rama will sell you that PS3

5210
03:13:54,000 --> 03:13:58,000
I don't know, alright Spaznator, I gotta let you go to wrap up the show, but take care buddy

5211
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:00,000
Alright, have a good one

5212
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:01,000
Alright, bye bye

5213
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:07,000
Man, we had the sad trombone email and now we have the sad trombone phone call

5214
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:10,000
Three Playstation 3s get the yellow light of death

5215
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:12,000
Some guys have all the luck

5216
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:18,000
And yet he didn't say I'm breaking up with Sony, he said you know I just

5217
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:23,000
I've spent so much on Sony over the years, I still love Sony

5218
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:26,000
Alright, this is the part of the show where we wrap it all up

5219
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:28,000
Thank you guys for calling in tonight, we appreciate it

5220
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:31,000
If you didn't get through, I'm sorry, but please send us an email with your thoughts

5221
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

5222
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:37,000
I know you gotta type, but we'll read it next week on the show

5223
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:41,000
Anyhow, we're gonna wrap it up and call it a week here at Orange Lounge Radio

5224
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:45,000
But not before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts

5225
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:50,000
And I also plug real quick that if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio

5226
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:52,000
All we ask, please help us spread the word

5227
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:55,000
Tell a couple people you know about the show

5228
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:58,000
We really would appreciate it, you know

5229
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:00,000
Word of mouth is all we have

5230
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:03,000
We don't even get $2500 from this show

5231
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:07,000
So even though that law wouldn't apply to us, it's still stupid

5232
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:11,000
So just help us spread the word, that's all we ask

5233
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:14,000
And we'll try to keep entertaining you

5234
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:19,000
For all the way through 10 years, come next June

5235
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:21,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight

5236
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,000
Dara Sacra, we'll start with you

5237
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,000
We have many themes

5238
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,000
My final thought is

5239
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:30,000
Long Show means no Pinkberry, frown

5240
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:32,000
Loki

5241
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:36,000
I have a headache and I really need to remember to bring Dan Wangan Midnight for the PS3

5242
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:40,000
That's gonna do it, thank you guys so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio

5243
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:43,000
Thank you guys in chat, thank you guys on the podcast feed

5244

And thank you for your support

5245
