Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
There's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, July 17th, 2011, another company is set to charge for online passes.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Could an old MMO be coming to the PS Vita and PopCap Games finds a buyer?

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
Orange Lounge Radio. It is July 17th, episode 420 of our show.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
I'll just kind of leave that over there and let the jokes write themselves.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
We are here to talk about video games on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:50.000 --> 01:00.000
You can join us live every week, Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern and All Games Radio right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at www.allgames.com

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you with my co-hosts. First off, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Hey, how's it going, Jamie?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I don't know, I'm allergic.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
So wasted.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
No, I'm not. I'm high on coffee right now that Dark Sakura brewed for me before the show.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It's like a special blend. I like this.

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
I make excellent coffee. I will tell everybody, it's half hazelnut, half chocolate macadamia, which is decaf.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
And then marijuana.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
No. A teaspoon of Hershey's cocoa and a little bit of cinnamon.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Is coffee going to make me fat?

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
No. Because, keep in mind, cocoa does not really have any sugar in it.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Okay, alright.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
This is regular cocoa, like the can of cocoa.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Is this an episode of Orange Lawn Trader or am I watching like Cooking with Paula Deen? Because you are from the South, after all.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Ew.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
That woman is frightening. This woman.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
What's your problem with Paula Deen?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
They photoshopped her anyway.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
They just, she just likes butter.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
No, okay. Have you, look at every magazine cover and advertisement that she's on.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
It's always this one same smile. It's like they take different pictures of her and just plaster the same face on her in Photoshop.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
Well, I was looking through my Facebook pictures not that long ago and I had kind of a similar smile in a lot of my pictures.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Like I tend to do that whole like, what?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
But you're not photoshopped.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
You're right, I'm not photoshopped.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
To look like that.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Alright.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
It looks.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm naturally that beautiful.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
She looks like a wax sculpture.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
She looks like she belongs in Madame Trousseau's House of Wax or whatever.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
But her sculpture would be made out of butter.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Maybe butter is a good preservative.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
I don't know. Alright, look. We gotta also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Hi.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
And I know Loki knows a thing or two about cooking with butter.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Yes, it's the best way to go.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Exactly. So how are you, Loki?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm fine.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
What's your dinner of choice tonight? The listeners are dying to know.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
It's pepperoni pizza.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Pepperoni pizza. Good times.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
I ate some.

02:56.000 --> 03:06.000
It was good. I was just craving pizza the other day because, well, we were talking about pizza and I was like, hmm, I want pizza.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com, you guys can always join us and have your say in what's going on on this program.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Starting off with Break Man tonight.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Obviously, the chatters are making their own little jokes about this being episode 420.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
And Break Man says, most podcasts don't last this many episodes.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
You know, not to sound cocky, but you're right. A lot don't.

03:26.000 --> 03:35.000
I mean, granted, this show's been around since before podcasting was, so I think that's kind of how we were able to get the jump on that because we were a live3cc5.com show for a little while.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Starting in 2002.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
But there are some daily shows. The shows that go daily have the chance to get there.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I mean, you can get a daily show up to 420 episodes in a couple years.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
So, you know, there's definitely some that have made it there.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
And, hey, any show that can get past, like, 50 is a great accomplishment, if you ask me.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
It takes dedication to get that far daily, weekly, no matter what you are.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
So, yeah, but we're happy to be here.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
And thank you guys for joining us in chat every week, as you always do, whether you're high or not, to be listening to this program.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Thank you guys for always supporting us.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
It's a wonderful, wonderful feeling.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm still having some warm fuzzies coming off of Under Sedation Live, which is another program here at All Games Radio on Saturday nights.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
I was a guest on their 10th anniversary special, which aired last night.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
And for those that don't know, that was a show I was on before Orange Lounge Radio.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Dark Sakura was a guest many, many times. You can go back and check out the archives of that show over at their website.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
And, yeah, it was a lot of fun to just, you know, sit in on that just like good times.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
And some folks that were listening to it said, you don't really sound like the same guy on that program.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Well, you know, it's a different show.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm very laid back on Under Sedation Live because I'm not in the driver's seat, so to speak.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I can just sit there and be a jackass.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Kind of what Loki does on this program. I'm just kidding.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
No, that's correct.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Alright. Anyhow, let's move on.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Enough about talking about podcasts and podcasting.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Let's talk about video games and the types of games you've been playing this week.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
I played well, but really only to do my dailies.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Two more days and I'll be in another 150 Marks of the Damn World tree.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
This is the whole new Fire Land patch they put in that gave some good single player content.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
One item level away from being able to do Fire Lands.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
So, hopefully I can get one more good purple item and I'll be there.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
I also played a lot of Peggle on my iPhone.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
Just out of pure boredom in that and every so often when I need something brainless to do, I play Peggle.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
I also... God, what was it? I was playing on Steam.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I was playing actually some more Droplets.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Because it's, again, another thing that I can kind of not really think about while I play.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
And I'm not really all that great at it anyway, but it's kind of fun.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
And then I played...

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Crap, what else was it that I was playing?

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Oh yeah, we had some Initial D going on because we have Extreme Stage.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
And, which is funny to watch Dan play.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
What's the deal with Extreme Stage?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
It's the new PS3 one.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
The thing about those Japanese racing games is that there's always some little subtitle to it.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
And I'm like, well, what's new about this one?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
It's just another racing game with techno music.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
We have the second stage game that was on PlayStation 2.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
And we have this one for PS3.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And the PS2 one is better.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It has a lot more music.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
I mean, this one's got, I think, some harder tracks in it and it's prettier.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
But I honestly think, play-wise, that second stage was better.

06:37.000 --> 06:45.000
But Dan managed to get it really cheap from one of the PlayStation, the best, greatest hits, whatever.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
So are those Initial D games on PS3 kind of faithful to the arcade?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah, it's exactly like the one we have at Golf Land.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Do you have to know a lot of Japanese to play those games?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yes.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Damn.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
However...

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Because I'm not very good.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Are there translations on game FAQs?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Yes.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Dan has an FAQ and he even has the whole story mode translated and everything.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Oh nice, okay.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
But when he got it, he didn't have any of that.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And thankfully, I could read just enough of it.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Right.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
That I could say, okay, this one means you want to replay.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah, but you had a couple years of Japanese in college, right?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yeah.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I had just enough.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
Like, I read a retarded five-year-old in Japanese.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
So I had just enough in me that I could say, okay, that's what that says, that's what that says.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
And then we sort of figured out, because I could read half of some of the kanji in the tracks.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
So I was like, okay, that one's Irohazaka, that one's, you know, Akina, that one, so...

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I gotta say this in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
We've got Dark Tetsuya's in there saying, Rob, you mean Eurobeat?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Because I called it techno.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
And yeah, the thing about Initial D especially is it has a very unique style of music that plays in the background.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
If you've never heard Initial D music before, it sounds something like this.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
You know there is such a thing as that.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Doesn't that make you want to run over people?

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
You've been in the car with me, driving to LA, listening to...

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
While you're going 105 miles an hour and it's frightening.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
In my Lancer. In my old Lancer.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Well, now we had Dan driving and guess what he wanted to listen to?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Eurobeat.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
There is something about Eurobeat that makes you go faster.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
But, you know, they also, you can do Para Para to stuff other than Eurobeat.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
There's Tech Para.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Really?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
But actually the whole Eurobeat thing is really, I think, making a huge, huge comeback too.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
I want to see emo Para.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Emo Para?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
That's goth dancing.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Exactly, but Para.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
Now see, I'm a little partial to the music in Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Oh hell yeah.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Because it's not really Eurobeat.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
It's more like just, I don't know, techno...

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
It's racing music.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
It just makes me want to drive fast.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Listen to this.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Trance?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
You know what my song in that game is?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Yeah, kind of Trance.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Was it Destination Blackout?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Or that's another Para Para song.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I don't know.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Then of course there's F-Zero music.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh god.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
God, I miss F-Zero so much.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Nintendo, why do you hate me?

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Well, I have just loaded you up with old school Bimani Rob.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Sweet.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Including some Para Para.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
And Papa Music.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I'll be skipping that folder.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
No, I've put in like a few songs, but I'll also give you some Papa Music stuff.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
So you can get your Dez Row on.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I never got into the Papa Music soundtracks.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
It's fun to drive to Dez Row.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I'll take your word for it.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Alright, any other games you've been playing this week?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I've been playing...

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Apparently I've been playing Kick Dan and Asleep.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
How do you earn points in that game?

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Whoever wakes up with the most bruises, I don't know.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Oh, and I swam.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I went outside.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
That's not a game, Loki.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Yeah, especially going outside.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
That's definitely not a game.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
I played just basically two things.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Grand Theft Auto.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
You know, typical stuff.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Still playing through ranked deathmatches.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And the Balagate Tony.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
And kind of getting back in the groove of that.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
And that didn't take me long.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
And I've already got all my coworkers very frustrated at me.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
And then I of course played a little bit of Earth Defense Horse Insect Armageddon.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Because it's just awesome.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Still kind of grinding my way through that.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
How long is that game?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Can you beat it in a few hours?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
It's not very long.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
It's a lot less missions than the first game.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
The first game had these really stupid missions that kind of repeated themselves almost.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
They had like 70 missions.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
This one has 15.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
But each mission is much longer.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
I don't remember how long it took me to beat it, but it wasn't that long.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
You could probably beat it in 10 hours.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Actually not even 10 hours. Probably a lot less than that.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Alright.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Holy crap. Guess what folder I just found.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Oh god.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
All of Loki's old mixes.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Oh, all the remixes he used to do.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
He hasn't made a mix in years.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Anyway, we don't want to deviate too much from games right now.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Sorry.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
No, that's alright.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
And then, yeah.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
So that's basically, I was just playing those.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Sweet.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
My gaming week.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Let's see, games I've been playing this week.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I'm still playing Final Fantasy 13, making my way through that.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
I finally beat Chapter 11, which I find is the point where most people say,

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
This game is awesome.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Or a lot of my friends kind of got to Chapter 11 and they're like,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
This game opened up way too much and now some of the monsters can actually kill me.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
I quit.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
But I found Chapter 11 to be great.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
And the trick is, folks, if you're stuck on Chapter 11, don't feel like it's like the rest of the game

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
where you have to fight every monster you come in contact with.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
In fact, many are better left avoided until you way level up your characters.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
A lot of those Seath side quests that you can do, you really shouldn't do until towards the end of the game.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
It's kind of comparable to Emerald Weapon from Final Fantasy 7.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
You really weren't supposed to do that until after the end.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
So there's, you know, you don't have to feel like you do everything right away.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
You can do that after the end too.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah, yeah.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Now I'm 13 from what I understand is the same way even though I haven't beat it yet.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
So I did finally play through, after doing about 15 of those side quests,

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
I did, actually it was more like, God, after climbing the tower, it was probably more like 30 of those side quests.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
I finally climbed the tower, got to the end of Chapter 11 and started Chapter 12

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
and I've got to say, oh my God, that was a badass cinematic that kicked off Chapter 12.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
I don't want to spoil too much of the story, but you'll figure out pretty quickly who the Eidolons are.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
They're like the Summons.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
They are all involved in the opening, like imagine Summons mixed with the scene out of Tron Legacy.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
That was the opening to Chapter 12 and like it was so hot, like I just, I had to fan myself after it was over.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
I think I've been, I've gotten to that point, but I don't remember.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
It was, it's really far in, you would remember.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
It was, it was an amazing cutscene.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
So yeah, now I'm at that point and trying to...

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Is that before the game? Okay, that's after...

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
That's way after it opens up.

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
You have to really, Chapter 11 will take you like as long as like five chapters did from the...

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, maybe, because I was wasting my time just doing all the side quests because I can.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
So, yeah, so that was, that was, you know, Final Fantasy 13.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
I probably poured like 40 hours into that now.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Talking about that game, even though it's like a year and a half old for like the past four weeks.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
But, understand, I, you know, can only put so many hours in in a week and I just recently picked it back up again.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
But I'm hoping in the next couple weeks I'll have it beat.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Other video games I've been playing, on Steam I played Beat Hazard.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Which I, for some reason, just can't get enough of that game.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Like, it's great. Like, it's a cool little...

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
I talked about it last week on the show, but again, it's, you can use your own music and it's Geometry Wars-esque.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
But it's a great little, like, kind of like how Dark Sakura was talking about Peggle.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
It's a great little game that you can play in three or five minute doses because that's how long the music in your library is.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
And it's kind of fun to play to a new song going, I wonder how this song is going to play.

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
And again, I love how you can buy these perks as you level up that make you want to go back and play the old songs again.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Because you can get a higher score and work towards a cumulative leaderboard.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
Lots of great stuff in that game. I'm, I'm liking Beat Hazard quite a bit.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
And then, let's see, other Steam games I've been playing, not a whole lot.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
I never did get around to Terraria. I've got to play that in the next week, the one that Dark Sakura was talking about last week.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I have a copy. Haven't played it yet.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
I was playing on the 360, a couple new games that I picked up.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Best Buy was having a buy one, get one sale on Kinect games.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
So I got a late birthday present from Salacious Pop of Child of Eden.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Finally got to play that game.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
And Your Self Fitness, I think, is that the Ubisoft Fitness game?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Your Self Fitness? That's what it's called, right?

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
The most well received of the Kinect fitness games is the one we got.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
Starting with Child of Eden, I played it for a little bit with Kinect.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
And it was a very interesting experience.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
I thought the Kinect sensitivity was good. It felt really good, like, as I was playing it.

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
But the one thing I didn't like was how you get a multiplier by firing on the beat of the music.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
That's part of how, like, the music comes into play.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
If you fire on the beat of the music, you kind of increase your multiplier.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Well, the way you fire in that mode is you kind of have to push your hand forward,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
or you have to kind of, I guess, flick your hand.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Like, that's how it reads a firing.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
And I don't find that to be very precise.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And when you're talking about music games, I really need precision.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And that was really weird to me.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
And I found myself really just flinging my hand forward,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
which really caused my hand to hurt after a little bit.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
So that could be my own bad, but the game also didn't explain it to me very well,

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
how I could really make sure I register that on the beat.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Now, the good thing is you can play with Kinect or controller.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
So after, like, playing it, you know, a little bit with Kinect,

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
I switched to the controller and played through a couple stages.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
And I like the controller responsiveness quite a bit more.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
And the game itself, it's basically Rez, but I'm going to admit,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I didn't like the music quite as much.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
I like that there's more elements to the game,

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
and I think the game is very great-looking graphically.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Like, when I talk about more elements, I like that there's, like, a second gun

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
that you use to use, like, one gun to shoot down bullets.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Like, a rapid-fire machine gun type thing.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
And then you use another to lock onto targets, just like you did in Rez.

16:07.000 --> 16:14.000
So it's a neat little interface, and it's a step up from Rez,

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
but unfortunately the music wasn't a step up from Rez for me.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
And maybe that's just personal preference,

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
but when the music is the core thing in the game,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I have to admit that was a little bit disappointing.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
But granted, I've only played a couple stages,

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
so I will beat the game and let you know if I ever find that stage

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
that has a song where I'm like, OMG, I loved it.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah, otherwise, I think as a Kinect game, it's certainly a lot of fun,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
and I think as one I would show people.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
But yeah, that sensitivity, music, firing mechanism thing,

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
I would love if there was, like, a clicker or something I could hold in my hand

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
while I'm doing it to allow something tangible that's more precise.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
But I don't really know how you would do that,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
and it kind of takes away from what the Kinect is all about.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
But like, you know how when you're using the Wiimote,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
you at least still have a button in your hand?

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Like, I hate to say it, but I almost think this game might be a little better

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
with the Wii controls.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Yikes. I don't know.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
So that was just my thoughts on it.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
So then you would probably want to play the PlayStation 3 version

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
with the Move controls.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah, actually. I think the Move might actually be better for this.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
But again, I am very much about I need the precision with the music game,

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
and I don't feel like moving my hand forward or flicking my hand,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
especially when the Kinect is not a perfect system.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
If you're not playing it in the perfect environment,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
it doesn't recognize you always.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
And that was some of the problems I had with the other game I played,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
your self-fitness.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
But it may work better, though, now with that new accessory that's coming out,

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
the Kinect Zoom thing from Nyko.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
That might be a little bit better.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
That might be better.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Again, at least the Kinect is better than the iToy was.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
The iToy, my God, that technology never worked right.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
But I feel Kinect is still a step above, but it's got a long way to go.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
The technology isn't perfect.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
But these games are still pretty early.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchy.com, Zether says,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I heard The Child of Eden didn't sell good.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Yeah, apparently it only sold about 30-some-odd thousand copies,

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
which didn't really even put it in the top 20 of games that were sold last month.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
I don't know, maybe Loki knows more about what sales ultimately mean and so forth.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
But I honestly think what probably scared a lot of people off were these reviews talking about,

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
it's a 90-minute game, and you're paying $60 for it.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
I'm hoping that this game will sell much more when it gets discounted,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
because I think it's one of the better Kinect games.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
It's just a niche game.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I mean, Rez and stuff, that was a niche game.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
And unfortunately, it's a niche that we like, but it's a niche game.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
And that's the problem.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
I mean, it's just like Earth Defense Force.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Earth Defense Force didn't sell that great either.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
But if The Child of Eden had Britney Spears music in it, it would have sold ten times as many copies, right?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
It would have been stupid though.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Actually, no, I don't think it would have sold ten times as many copies.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I think still people wouldn't give it a chance.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
And even less copies would have been sold, because people would have been like,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
you know, like us, I'm not touching that shit.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
What the hell is this?

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
But yeah, Earth Defense Force, it sold, I think they estimated like 95,

19:12.000 --> 19:18.000
well, like 65,000 to like 90,000 copies worldwide, which is fine,

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
because the launch quantities of that were only about 200,000 per platform.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
So they're not expecting to sell much.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
They know, you know, going into it, what they're expecting to get out of it.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
And a game like Child of Eden, I don't think, development-wise,

19:35.000 --> 19:43.000
it didn't cost as much money to put it together as, say, like, you know, a Modern Warfare game or something like that,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
where you have to sell a lot more to make up the money.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
I mean, I don't think that they had really huge expectations for it.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah, true, true. That's a good point.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
So, I'll quickly talk about the fitness game I played.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Your Shape Fitness, your Cell Fitness, I don't know, one of those fitness games.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
The one from Ubisoft.

20:01.000 --> 20:08.000
I really liked the idea of the whole tailored custom-to-you individual workout thing.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I liked that.

20:10.000 --> 20:19.000
But I didn't like how the Kinect, again, doesn't really recognize you 100% of what you're doing,

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
because this game grades you pretty rigidly on the exercises you're doing.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
And, you know, if you're not like perfect within the box that it has,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
and your arms go way too out, like you don't get credit for stuff,

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
and it can be very frustrating, especially when the exercises are kind of kicking your butt a little bit.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
You know, it was having me do these squats.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
And the other thing I'm going to actually say I thought was terrible about this,

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
I truly think it was a bad decision to do this in a fitness game,

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
is when it was doing the calibration stages and having me warm up,

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
it did not start with a stretch activity.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
And I think that is a very poor thing to do in a fitness game.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
Actually, you want to warm up before you stretch.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Really?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Yes. Actually, yes.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Because you have to warm up the muscles before you stretch,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
or else you run a risk of pulling a muscle.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I think if you saw what this game was doing, though,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
some of the high-intensity exercises it was doing,

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
it's one thing to put a little flash card up on the screen saying,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
you should stretch before using this device.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
I honestly think a smarter little thing would have said,

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
okay, let's do some swaying in place, a little jogging,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
now we're going to stretch,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
now we're going to have you do the intensive squats and so forth.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Do they have a stretching portion at all?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Not that I ran into, but keep in mind,

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
this game kind of kicked my butt before I got very far into it.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I'd like to see it.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
I've been sore in my legs for four days since playing,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
and it's because stupid me didn't stretch beforehand.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
And I was a little bit upset that the game should have,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
I mean, I should have known better, yes.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I'm not going to totally blame the game,

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
but I just think it was a bad idea to not encourage me more,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
remind me, hey, stupid, before you can stretch.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Well, not everyone knows that you need to stretch beforehand.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
And I didn't think it was going to throw me so far into it

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
with the calibration where I'm doing some squatting

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
and things that are going to hurt my legs before telling me,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
hey, maybe we should do some yoga first.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Well, just like every fitness class that I've ever gone to,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
you start off with a warm-up,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
you do light stretching, then you do your exercise,

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
then you do full stretching when you're done.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Because by then, your muscles are already warmed up and limber,

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
and that's when you need to stretch so that you don't,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
so that when your muscles cool down,

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
they've stretched out and they won't cramp.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And again, I want to clarify before,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
because this might show up later in the game,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
so I want to be very careful in what I'm saying.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
I was going through an initial setup calibration mode,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
but it was having you do exercises as part of the calibration,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
like a full routine type of thing,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
and it did not have me stretch beforehand,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
nor did no reminder come up at any point.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
And maybe after the calibration,

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
when you get into the actual daily stuff,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
you'll see more of that, but I'm not going to,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
if I didn't see it beforehand, I'm a little worried.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
So I have to razz the game on that,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
and if you are going to play one of these games,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
make sure you stretch at some point.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I guess if dark soccer brings up a point,

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
do a few runs, do a few dance moves or whatever,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
then stretch, then play.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Because it makes all the difference with how well

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
you can keep up with the exercises too,

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
if you've given your chance to warm up and then stretch.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I like this comment from Kaijuto in our chat room,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
chat.orangelandsready.com.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
You do the stretch when you try to get the game out of the shrink wrap.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
That's true. Some of those shrink wraps are pretty terrible,

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
but my arms don't hurt. It's my legs.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I'm telling you guys for real.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
And it's sad, okay, I'm a teacher, right?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Not a kid teacher, but an adult teacher.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
I teach in a corporate environment.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
But I use classrooms full of computers,

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
and I walk around and look at adults on their systems all day long,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
making sure they're following with me and so forth.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
So I have to walk around the room.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
The day after I did this Connect exercise,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I couldn't walk as much.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
And I'm having to explain to my class,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
yeah, sorry guys, I was playing Connect yesterday,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
and those things are pretty rough.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
How embarrassing is that?

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Fool, you should have known to stretch.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
You know, it used to happen to me when I would go play DDR on my lunch break.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
And I'd come back, my knees hurt.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
And like I had to, walking upstairs was not a problem.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Walking downstairs, oh my gosh,

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
I felt like a little old lady clutching to that railing.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I should have used the elevator.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
It's like you're doing squats all over again.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
It's easier to lift it than to drop to it.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
It's traumatic.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
But I'm not going to give up,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
and I'm not going to say a lot of negative things about the game

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
because of that one thing.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
You know, I'll know next time to stretch,

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
but I really think the game should have incorporated it better.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
If I missed it, and I consider myself a pretty smart individual,

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
if I missed it, who knows who else is missing this and hurting themselves.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Hmm.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Thought?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
No, not about that.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Oh, okay.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
It's actually something that came up in my video game week

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
that I didn't get to play because of a certain something.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Uh, sure.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. It just occurred to me.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
That's okay. That was the last game I wanted to talk about anyway.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
The arcade that had Para Para Paradise is out of business.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Hmm.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
The Arcadia Bunning Games or whatever it's called,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
the kind of crappy ghetto.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Oh, the little crappy, yeah.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
But they had a Para Para machine.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
I'm not surprised they had it all. They went out of business.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
They're gone.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
It really was a matter of time.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
I wanted to go play Para Para because I don't have Dance Masters.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Their location really was never that good.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
But we should buy that place and open up the actual Orange Lounge arcade in batting cages.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
That would be great.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
See, I bet it's dirt cheap.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
All right. Anyhow, go into our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeready.com.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Derek H. is in our chatroom saying,

25:48.000 --> 25:54.000
Rob is correct. Even Carmen Electra's aerobic striptease workout DVDs have an extensive stretching section.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
See?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
And even if your pole dancing classes tell you,

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
and I don't know why Derek H. knows so much about pole dancing classes,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
but I'll just assume he does,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
even if they're getting you to stretch,

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
you know that these games need to make sure they are incorporating that into their customized workouts.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
All right.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
That's it for our gaming weeks.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Quickly, housekeeping.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Make sure you follow us on all those great websites around the interwebs.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R or Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

26:24.000 --> 26:30.000
They kick businesses off of Google Plus right now, so we are not on Google Plus.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
You can follow one of us, this individual, or actually, Loki.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Loki refuses to make the switch to Plus, right?

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
I'm not going to get Plus. Screw that.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Well, I'm on there, and so is Dark Sakura, so you can follow us.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I have a circle for O-L-R people, so it works.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
And occasionally, I'll post O-L-R related things.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
But also, I want to plug our website.

26:51.000 --> 26:57.000
Had some very minor changes to it this week just in graphics with some of the quick links to some things.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
We now have a link to the Tumblr.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
Orange Lounge Radio has an official Tumblr account for you hipster people that like to tumble.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
We have that, and we incorporated the Ustream in there.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
Even though we haven't been using it that much after the E3, you never know when we might go back to that at some point.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
So I want to make sure people would follow us on there if they wanted to.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
So check that out. OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
All right, enough housekeeping. Let's get to video game news.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Loki starts off tonight.

27:21.000 --> 27:30.000
We're starting off with a comment from one of the Sony Network Entertainment execs, the president Tim Schafe,

27:30.000 --> 27:38.000
who spoke at GamesBeat 2011 about the PlayStation Network downtime.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
And he said, Sony is very pleasantly surprised by the experience.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
The customers have all come back, and the network performance is better than ever.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Sales are better than ever.

27:48.000 --> 27:54.000
So just goes to show you, all those people are like, you know, they're done for.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
They ended up selling a lot more because of this.

27:59.000 --> 28:06.000
And then it says, of course, the downtime costs Sony approximately $171 million.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
You know, they would not like to do it again, obviously.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
They said one time was enough, but it was a great learning experience. We agree.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
That was a very interesting choice of words.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
It was a learning experience, but once is enough.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
That isn't the most politically correct statement.

28:26.000 --> 28:33.000
He had to explain a little bit, because the first quote was, it was a great experience.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
No, that's not exactly how you would describe that.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
A humbling experience might be a little bit better.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
I'm just saying, do you know how many times in my day-to-day job I use a phrase like that?

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
You know, because people make mistakes all the time.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
And you know, it's frustrating to make mistakes.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
You want to, especially when you're at your job, you want to do the best job you possibly can.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
But a lot of times people make mistakes.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
It's just, it's a learning experience.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
We just, we have to learn from it.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
And we make mistakes in here. It's okay.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
This is very funny to hear Sony kind of use that same.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
This was a learning experience.

29:08.000 --> 29:15.000
But they are planning to invest some money to make sure that the PlayStation Network is secure.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
They're committing 20 million dollars.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
And they're also seeking out independent developers to create games like, you know,

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
Pixel Junk, Side Scroller, and Papoyo, Boku stuff.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
They're also saying that they're going to be, you know,

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
doing this pub fun to bring innovative, different, unique gameplay to the PlayStation Network.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
So they're kind of trying to beef up their content on there,

29:41.000 --> 29:48.000
because it could use a little bit of beefing up.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
So that's kind of cool.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah, I'm glad they're kind of bringing in all that extra support.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
Also, I think all this talk about how Google was going to go under, or I'm sorry, not Google, excuse me.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
I'm still thinking about Plus and all that.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
But how PlayStation was going to go under and all that after the hacking and all that.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
It seems to be a distant memory at this point.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
I'm looking at a comment in our chat room from Blender says,

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
Uncharted 3 Beta had 1.53 million players, by the way.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
And I do remember reading about that on the internet earlier this week.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
And I think a story had said it's the biggest PlayStation Beta that's ever happened.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
So it certainly gives the impression that people have pretty much forgiven Sony,

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
and we've all moved on with our lives, and we're back on PlayStation Network.

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
But there's also, I guess, that sense of fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

30:41.000 --> 30:47.000
If something bad happens again, I think you'll see a lot of people really mean it this time and leave.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
Of course, it also helps that it's Uncharted 3. It's a huge game.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
So of course, it's going to be one of their largest Betas they've ever had.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
So there you go.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
All right, moving on to some more stories about PlayStation.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
This also kind of directly relates to the hack, you know, now that we're about, what, a month afterwards here.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
Apparently, this is from Capcom, which is interesting.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
This is from the Capcom Europe head David Reeves was quoted saying this.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
We have seen on PlayStation Network, and probably Sony are in a better place to tell you this,

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
that there is a resurgence in people buying the generic PSN cards in retail stores

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
rather than putting up their credit card details.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
I think in the future, they will make more non-generic cards, like game-branded ones,

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
such as Street Fighter or FIFA, or even Modern Warfare.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
But the generic ones have done well.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
People are playing it a bit safe at the moment because the hackers will be back.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
That's my personal opinion. I mean, they will, right?

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
I don't know if that's really the best thing to be saying there, but...

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Oh, shut up, Capcom.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
You know, we see that they're buying more generic cards.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
Yeah, hopefully they're not buying your games with your crappy DRM shit.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
Oh, your games didn't work during the whole PlayStation Network outage,

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
or at least your two PlayStation Network games.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Those are awfully pretty good spirits to be in

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
when you consider they missed out on all those weeks of sales, you know?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I'm kind of surprised it wasn't...

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
I mean, granted, that might be one quote out of a much larger interview, but still.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
It's because they need them more than Sony needs them, you know?

32:25.000 --> 32:33.000
Because if they stop supporting Sony, then their sales kind of get cut in about half.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
Whereas if Sony loses them, there's plenty of other developers out there

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
and plenty of other publishers that put content on their system.

32:42.000 --> 32:49.000
Well, have you used your credit card to buy stuff on PlayStation Network at all?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Either of you?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
We did.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
That was just from Moondiver.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
Have you gone back after the hack?

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
We haven't really wanted anything else, but Dan got the freebies.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
Yeah, I got the freebies. I don't know if I bought anything on PSN.

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
I try not to buy anything on there, not because I'm afraid of my credit card information being hacked,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
but because I don't want to spend money on their network.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
And that goes for Microsoft, too.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
I don't really want to buy anything, because I got into the habit where,

33:18.000 --> 33:24.000
oh, I got to buy all the Xbox Live Arcade games, and I did that for a while.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
How many of them do I play now?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
None of them.

33:28.000 --> 33:36.000
So the last thing I bought on there, I think, was the Pirates of the Caribbean expansion for LittleBigPlanet.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
And that was the last thing that I purchased on there.

33:38.000 --> 33:44.000
And honestly, I don't see myself really purchasing anything else for there.

33:44.000 --> 33:50.000
You never know. I don't know.

33:50.000 --> 33:56.000
If I'm going to purchase download content for something, most of the time I'm gaming on my 360 anyway.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
I don't think I've bought anything since the hack happened,

33:59.000 --> 34:08.000
but I will say that Salacious Pop is strongly encouraging me to get the arcade Super Street Fighter

34:08.000 --> 34:14.000
Arcade Edition expansion there on PlayStation Network, because that's where we own Super Street Fighter IV.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
So I may have to buy something in the near future. We'll see.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Well, I have some Ubisoft news.

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
They have confirmed that there is going to be an online pass to be used for its games.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
It's called the Uplay Passport.

34:32.000 --> 34:42.000
It's $9.99, basically $10, for access to the online features of many of their core games when bought second hand.

34:42.000 --> 34:50.000
So if you bought the game, you have a registration code that comes in it, and it has exclusive bonus content and whatnot.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
But the first game that's going to be using this is Driver San Francisco.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
No UK price yet.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
Alright, well, Loki, aren't you excited to hear about this?

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
You know, it's just another company jumping on this horrible bandwagon, and I don't see the point.

35:08.000 --> 35:15.000
And I was trying to find, there was another article that actually had their press release for that in there,

35:15.000 --> 35:24.000
and I really want to find that so that I can, oh here we go, so they can read you their PR spin on this, and it's just ridiculous.

35:24.000 --> 35:33.000
It's what gamers want. Gamers want that premium experience that their $10 goes to help.

35:33.000 --> 35:40.000
Uh, let's see, I'm trying to find, god I really wish I had it.

35:40.000 --> 35:52.000
Basically, they spun it as, it allows us, you know, extra content like online multiplayer and stuff like that.

35:52.000 --> 36:03.000
I'm sorry, if I'm buying a game that has online multiplayer in it, and that does, because it does brand new, so therefore it should, you know, use,

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
I don't understand why I should have to pay extra if I'm buying used.

36:07.000 --> 36:15.000
Now I've heard people make, and I gotta say the most ridiculous and stupid comment saying,

36:15.000 --> 36:23.000
oh well you know, they've gotta pay for their servers, and you know, if you buy used, the game publisher doesn't, or the game developer doesn't get any money.

36:23.000 --> 36:29.000
Let me correct you on a few things right here, okay, it's hilarious how stupid a comment that is.

36:29.000 --> 36:37.000
One, all used games start off as new at some point, so they've made their money for that game to fund that online network.

36:37.000 --> 36:44.000
I have to be devil's advocate and give you the counterpoint, but if the game wasn't being sold used, then that would force someone to buy it new.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
Not necessarily, because some people might not buy it, they may just skip it altogether.

36:49.000 --> 36:56.000
And whereas if you got a used sale, you may have the chance that other people might enjoy that game, and they may later on decide,

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
hey you know what, I'm gonna go pick up, you know, later, you know, more games from this developer or whatnot.

37:01.000 --> 37:09.000
And, on top of all that, you're saying, you know, people say that the developer doesn't get money for used sales.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
Well, it doesn't matter, because the developer already got paid when the game got pressed.

37:14.000 --> 37:23.000
Okay, yeah, they get some kickbacks for sales and stuff like that, but you know what, it's not, you know, it doesn't matter if they sell them in the stores.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
They've already sold them to those stores, they've already made their money.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
You know, they could sell, you know, 100,000 copies and they could be all sitting on, you know, store shelves.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
It doesn't fucking matter, because the publisher and developer got paid.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
Going to our chatroom for some comments, chat.orangesonshady.com.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
Sterlok says, cool, more games I'm not buying.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Dartetsuya says, they fuck us over and for whatever reason, people still step up to defend them.

37:46.000 --> 37:53.000
Okay, well, I'm not necessarily defending this here, but I have to, well, yes and no, because I have to be honest.

37:53.000 --> 37:59.000
A lot of this news story I just kind of roll my eyes at and I'm like, I don't care, because I really do buy most of my stuff new.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
Like, either I'm gonna buy it new, or I'm gonna get it on one of those rental accounts.

38:03.000 --> 38:10.000
And there are very few games that I would play online that I wouldn't just buy new.

38:10.000 --> 38:15.000
Most games I want to play online with friends, I'm excited about and I want to buy them right away.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
But you're not seeing the writing on the wall, Rob.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
You see, if you give them an inch, they're gonna take a mile.

38:19.000 --> 38:27.000
If you start thinking that this is an okay thing for them to do, then everybody jumps on board and they start doing this for multiplayer.

38:27.000 --> 38:35.000
Then you know what? Then they start going, hey, you know, we're noticing that it seems that our used game sales or whatever, our new sales, aren't really being impacted enough.

38:35.000 --> 38:44.000
We need to make sure that this is really something that people are gonna want to buy new by adding more content for this pass or whatever.

38:44.000 --> 38:53.000
So they're gonna start taking more stuff out of the single player games and they're gonna start dipping into other things that would have normally been free download content or something like that.

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
Just because people are okay with it and people are supporting them and actually defending them in this process.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
So that's the point. You gotta stop it now.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
You can't wait until later on when they're like, oh, well, it doesn't matter because I buy a lot of games new.

39:07.000 --> 39:16.000
Yeah, until they start saying, oh, hey, you know what? We can make a lot more money by charging for online multiplayer by having it download content or something.

39:16.000 --> 39:23.000
I will say it does piss me off. And this is interesting because I do kind of have different opinions depending on what system it is.

39:23.000 --> 39:30.000
I kind of think the PlayStation 3 has a little more room to get away with what they're doing here than Xbox Live does.

39:30.000 --> 39:37.000
As far as I'm concerned, every game should be fucking playable online because I pay that fee for Xbox Live every year. Period.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
And when there does come a day, and you're right, maybe I shouldn't wait for it.

39:40.000 --> 39:47.000
But I will tell you when that day doesn't ever become that maybe there is a game I want to play online that's subject to this project $10 thing on Xbox Live.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
I'm going to be irate, and I refuse to support it on Xbox.

39:51.000 --> 39:57.000
And I will take Microsoft to task for that because Microsoft's allowing it to happen by selling it on their store.

39:57.000 --> 40:03.000
And I'm sorry, that's double dipping. You're charging me twice for the same thing, and that is to play my game online.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
So I honestly think the company that needs to put their foot down is Microsoft.

40:08.000 --> 40:15.000
Sony, they're providing a free service. It's harder to get mad at them on that side.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
Because you aren't paying for online over there. The whole infrastructure is free.

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
And to say that to charge $10 for maintenance, you can get away with that a lot more on that end than you can on Microsoft's end.

40:25.000 --> 40:34.000
I'm already paying for maintenance. I don't give a fuck if you said that, well, you're going to let servers or companies run their own servers like EA

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
because otherwise they're not going to host games on Xbox Live.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
That's your fucking problem, and that's for you guys to work out.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
Moment I get double dipped for online charges, I am out.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Sony Fanboy 4 life, you all.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
For the record, just because easily wanted to hear it?

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Sure.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Objection!

40:52.000 --> 40:59.000
Well, I mean, it's like I've said before, and you know, no one seemed to care then, and it's happening more now.

40:59.000 --> 41:08.000
And yeah, it doesn't really bother me too much because I don't buy Wii games, but there's a lot of Wii games out there nowadays that, you know,

41:08.000 --> 41:18.000
maybe music games, maybe, you know, I don't know, just some other type of game, but where they're charging $60 for it.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
No one said anything, so you know what, this is something that's now commonly happening.

41:22.000 --> 41:31.000
Like for example, and I mean, this is definitely not a game I'm buying, but you know, like that Spyro fucking game that's coming out.

41:31.000 --> 41:40.000
The new Spyro Skylanders Adventurer bullshit thing that they're selling some stupid, I don't even know what the hell it is,

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
piece of plastic that you gotta put little figurines on to play as those characters in the game.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
It's basically like physical download content.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
They're charging $80 for this fucking game, so that's gonna be fail right there.

41:52.000 --> 41:57.000
And on top of all that, they're gonna sell additional characters for like three bucks each.

41:57.000 --> 42:08.000
Like stupid little toys, and they're hoping that people get suckered into this because zuzu pets and these squinkies bullshit toys that kids like nowadays.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
I don't even know what, I've never fucking heard of a zuzu in my life.

42:11.000 --> 42:19.000
A zuzu pet, it was like a couple Christmases ago, it was like the hottest toy ever, it's a stupid toy hamster that moves around.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
Oh, those horrid things and whatever.

42:22.000 --> 42:28.000
Yes, I know. Listen, kids are starting out stupid early on, okay, and they just become stupid adults. I know.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I hope Richard Gere doesn't own a zuzu.

42:30.000 --> 42:44.000
Yeah, so it's just dumb, and they're trying all these different tactics to get money for things they really shouldn't be getting money for.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
Developers getting money for used games, fuck it, you shouldn't get money for used games.

42:48.000 --> 42:55.000
That's it. It's a market, it's just a market that was created by people, and it doesn't even have to be necessarily that.

42:55.000 --> 43:03.000
Let's say, for example, Rob, I loan you a copy of my game, and you want to play it online. You can't, you have to pay $10 now.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
Why? Oh, because it's someone else accessing their network.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
And I've already paid for that on Xbox Live.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Yes.

43:13.000 --> 43:20.000
They just use the more subscription model based thing, but I'm telling you, I've been an Xbox Live member for like six, seven years.

43:20.000 --> 43:27.000
If they allow this shit to continue, I'm out. You know what I mean? There will come a point, probably, where there's a game I'm going to want to play online.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
I'm going to be pissed that I'm double-dipping, and I'm canceling Xbox Live when that happens.

43:31.000 --> 43:45.000
If Sony's doing it, if Ubisoft's doing it, EA's doing it, THQ's doing it, Warner Games is doing it, it's not going to be long before everybody jumps on board with this, and hopefully not Microsoft.

43:45.000 --> 43:54.000
Interesting comment from Rom—well, okay. If Microsoft did it, now, they need to be called out if that happens, because—oh my god.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
All right, anyway.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Raman, our chat room at chat.ornisontree.com.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
You know, if you're patient enough, you can buy the games as new when the price drops.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Not that serious to get the game on day one.

44:03.000 --> 44:09.000
I'd rather wait a few weeks for the game to drop to $30, $40 new than wait a week and buy it used for $45, $50.

44:09.000 --> 44:18.000
You know, that's a damn good point. You know, why not just kind of wait for it to drop the price new, and then really it's no better than buying it used, right?

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
Or, it is better, because you're not having to get subject to this whole $10 thing, right?

44:22.000 --> 44:29.000
That is technically a way to get it cheaper, but people want their games right away.

44:29.000 --> 44:34.000
But, you know, the way I look at it is, if you're buying it used anyways, you're probably not getting it day one anyways.

44:34.000 --> 44:40.000
So just wait even longer. In a game like Driver, I mean, let's look at Driver.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
I mean, the pedigree of Driver hasn't been that great.

44:43.000 --> 44:50.000
The first one was great, the second one was all right, the third one was terrible, and the fourth one, eh, kind of terrible as well.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
So, the fifth one, eh, I wouldn't be surprised if it's terrible.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
And it's definitely not a game I'd be playing online anyways.

44:59.000 --> 45:07.000
All right, let's move on with some other topics here before we make Loki's head explode.

45:07.000 --> 45:18.000
This is hilarious. Now, the PlayStation Vita, last thing I thought it would probably be getting would be Final Fantasy XI,

45:18.000 --> 45:25.000
but apparently Square Enix is actually looking at maybe porting Final Fantasy XI to the PlayStation Vita.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
No mention of Final Fantasy XIV. That just doesn't exist.

45:29.000 --> 45:39.000
But Final Fantasy XI, their only online game in the Final Fantasy series, will be possibly ported to the PlayStation Vita.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
Their only online game?

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
In the Final Fantasy series.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
What? Did they just totally forget about Final Fantasy XIV?

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
No, no, no, that's my comments.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Oh, I see, I see. Okay.

45:52.000 --> 45:59.000
XIV doesn't exist. No, it's just, it's kind of interesting though if they did that,

45:59.000 --> 46:07.000
but I think it'd be kind of cool, because think about it, you know, MMOs haven't really come to handhelds, so...

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
Yeah, not that I can think of. Or maybe Phantasy Star.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Phantasy Star, maybe.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
Well, actually, but the Phantasy Star portable games were, contained little single player games.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
They were like, they were a lot like Universe's single player mode.

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
So, yeah, I'd like that. I'd welcome that, actually.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
I hear Final Fantasy XI's made, it's still going, it's still improving.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
They did graphical improvements.

46:29.000 --> 46:36.000
If you're a PC player, you got some new graphic textures this last go around, so I think that's, I think that's kind of rad.

46:36.000 --> 46:45.000
I don't think it's really possible to put XIV on a portable platform, because despite the fact that everybody criticizes it for being poop,

46:45.000 --> 46:51.000
it was a really good looking game, and the Vita probably just doesn't possess the power graphically to pull it off.

46:51.000 --> 46:56.000
But, you know, XI was a game that was made for the PS2, and that's the biggest drawback to XI,

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
is that everything they do on XI still has to support the PlayStation 2,

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
because a lot of folks in Japan, that's how they adopted it, was on the PS2.

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
So, until there comes a day where they say, well, we no longer are going to support the old platform,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
so I just don't see them being able to do that.

47:10.000 --> 47:19.000
I think that's what XIV was trying to do, but failed miserably because they didn't make the, they tried to change the core game,

47:19.000 --> 47:25.000
and they took out the goddamn auction houses, which every MMO like, needs, so I don't, oh my god.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
And they kept the same races, but changed the names, that's just stupid.

47:29.000 --> 47:36.000
Yeah, so anyway, I think it's a neat idea to have, especially considering the Vitas are supposed to have 3G in them and everything,

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
like, I think that's kind of a cool use.

47:38.000 --> 47:45.000
I would be curious what other types of MMOs come out of this, maybe not just ports of old stuff, but some new ideas,

47:45.000 --> 47:51.000
especially because, isn't part of the whole Vitas thing supposed to be finding gamers around you?

47:51.000 --> 47:59.000
Well, yeah, you've got, you know, GPS built into them, and, you know, all the different little services that they have and stuff.

47:59.000 --> 48:07.000
Can you imagine an MMO where you would actually have to, like, be within so many feet of a person in order to fight them?

48:07.000 --> 48:13.000
Like, so you encounter people IRL? Like, I don't know, like, I just, there's got to be great ways to integrate-

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
It sounds like a bad, bad, like, Pokemon-

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
I know, it sounds like a bad, like, molester thing waiting to happen, but I don't know, I just kind of think, like-

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
If you don't defeat me, I will rape you.

48:23.000 --> 48:31.000
It just, I don't know, it just sounds like a neat thing to kind of integrate the GPS stuff into MMOs somehow, I don't know.

48:31.000 --> 48:38.000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Spazinator says, Final Fantasy XI would be a system seller.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
I used to love it on the PlayStation 2.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
Tigerclaw says, MMOs on a PlayStation Vita.

48:43.000 --> 48:50.000
I sense you can do some sort of transferring type of stuff from the PlayStation 3 to the Vita with MMOs.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
It's very hard to play Final Fantasy XI on a PlayStation 3.

48:54.000 --> 49:00.000
Like, you could do it, but you have to have the exact right model of PlayStation in order to be able to play it.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
I do!

49:01.000 --> 49:10.000
Yeah, I know, you have to have, like, the- and I'm not, like, it's not even just the backward compatible ones, like, there's one that has some type of port that the hard drive attaches to,

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
because I don't think you can use PlayStation 3's hard drive for 11, can you? I can't remember.

49:15.000 --> 49:23.000
No, you, well, you can't at all, because it's a three and a half drive versus a laptop SATA drive, and it's an old IDE drive.

49:23.000 --> 49:38.000
So you would have to clone, well, I think they had something that you could download off the PlayStation Network that was basically the cloned hard drive information, I think, for the Final Fantasy XI stuff.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
This is a curious comment from Spaznator in our chat room.

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
With Final Fantasy XI being on the Vita, I may reconsider my position on the system.

49:47.000 --> 49:57.000
So it sounds to me like Final Fantasy XI is, like, a must-have game, even though it's an old game, it's kind of like, it's revisiting an old friend, or it's having a port of something on a platform.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
Are the Vita launch games really that bad looking so far?

50:01.000 --> 50:07.000
Where it's taking a- how old is Final Fantasy XI? It's about as old as this show, isn't it?

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I think it came out in 02 in Japan, right?

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
Yes.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
It's a nine year old game.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Let me put it this way.

50:12.000 --> 50:21.000
Launch titles right now are pretty sparse. They haven't really said what they're launching with yet.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
Other than Uncharted, Uncharted is a big title for that.

50:25.000 --> 50:30.000
Of course. Well, there was that neat looking dungeon game with the whole PlayStation 3 integration I thought was neat.

50:30.000 --> 50:38.000
But that's about it. They haven't really said yet what a lot of launch games are going to be. It's still really early, I think.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Right.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
Alright, well moving on to other stories about the Vita.

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
This has to do with a developer comment on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
And it comes from Naughty Dog game director Justin Richman.

50:51.000 --> 50:58.000
Of course Naughty Dog is the group behind Uncharted, as well as classics like Crash Bandicoot.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
So they've always been in Sony's camp, obviously.

51:00.000 --> 51:06.000
But saying a pretty big slam that's pro Sony and anti-Nintendo.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
In an interview with Now Gamer, Justin Richman said, quote,

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
To be honest with you, the idea of it is very, very cool, speaking about the Wii U.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
But there's nothing that the Wii U has that the Vita and PlayStation 3 doesn't.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
You know, it's an interesting piece of technology and I'm interested to see how people use it.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I'm not completely sold yet.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
That the screen isn't multi-touch, that's a little weird.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
It seems that there are some very strange holes in it.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
But to be fair, last time I was skeptical of the original Wii and look at how that did.

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
I'm sure the games they make for Wii U will be amazing.

51:35.000 --> 51:43.000
Finally, I'm seeing that whole observation in the mainstream media that, hell, not even the Vita.

51:43.000 --> 51:49.000
But the PSP and the PlayStation 3 was kind of capable of that same technology of having a portable screen in your hand.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
And he brings up a point, I forgot, the Vita has a touchscreen.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
It is going to be just like the Wii U.

51:55.000 --> 52:02.000
If you have, I mean, granted, it'll be between a PlayStation 3 and a Vita way more expensive than a Wii U most likely will be.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
But he's got a good point.

52:04.000 --> 52:10.000
Couldn't you have the same game on the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 that you do on the Wii U?

52:10.000 --> 52:16.000
Could we see ports of games made for the Wii U come out on the PlayStation because it has that same capability?

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
Well, on top of that, it's got that back touch thing too.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
True.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
So that could even add another dimension.

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
You would see it, or you may see it, but there's going to be very few.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
I mean, no one's going to expect people to have two, three hundred dollar systems.

52:30.000 --> 52:35.000
Well, yeah, you're right. The ports would be a little weird on the Sony end, but you know...

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
It'd be like something like, here's some really optional way to play this.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
Maybe not like right away, but what about further down the line?

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
Or what about a game like, I don't know, Arkham Asylum is supposed to be on the Wii U, right?

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
So...

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
That's retarded. Oh, yeah. It'll be out on the Wii U a year after it comes out. Awesome!

52:52.000 --> 52:57.000
Well, it'll have some stinkin' bonus feature, something that everybody has to have.

52:57.000 --> 53:04.000
But my curiosity is, couldn't they release a similar game of the year edition, quote unquote,

53:04.000 --> 53:12.000
on the PlayStation 3, that could optionally bring up the Vita to do whatever the Wii U screen is doing?

53:12.000 --> 53:17.000
Yeah, it could, but people would just shrug their shoulders and say,

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
I'm not buying another fuckin' two hundred ninety-nine dollar system so that I can do this.

53:22.000 --> 53:28.000
True, but I don't know. If it's an optional and not a mandatory enhancement, does that make sense?

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
It would be like if, you know, Grind Turismo 5 was coming out, say, next year,

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
and the Vita, you could buy the Vita and use it as a rear view mirror.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
Would someone do that? Sure, I'm sure there's someone out there that would do that.

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
Which is what they had showed off that the PS3 was supposed to do in 2006.

53:45.000 --> 53:51.000
Now, is that necessarily a good use of your two hundred ninety-nine dollars? Probably not.

53:51.000 --> 53:58.000
Alright, well, we'll see what happens when the games get a little closer to coming out for the Wii U,

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
and when the Vita comes out, exactly what types of technology we see beyond what we've just seen at E3.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Moving on.

54:05.000 --> 54:11.000
Well, there is a dream come true for many, many people in West Virginia.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
Well, first of all, I will rewind.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
People stop making jokes about West Virginia?

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Hi, we're in West Virginia.

54:18.000 --> 54:25.000
Now, Konami is going to have the Childhood Obesity Summit in West Virginia this month,

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
and then they're going to have a DDR tournament for school-aged children in West Virginia.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
I hear that's going to be a cool summit, except there's going to be a lot of fatties.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Stop it.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
Sorry.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
At any rate, it's going to be held July 27th and 28th in Charleston,

54:41.000 --> 54:46.000
and it will have representatives from the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition,

54:46.000 --> 54:54.000
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Michael Danziger from The Biggest Loser,

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
and they will also have the West Virginia University Extension Service

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
and West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency hosting it.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
So there will be prizes.

55:03.000 --> 55:12.000
They're mainly scholarships, and they're hoping that they can just get kids more active.

55:12.000 --> 55:19.000
There will also be a technician on hand to maintain the DDR pads as they keep breaking.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
What are you talking about? This is DDR.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
There will be no technician to, you know, tech those pads.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
I think it's a good idea.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
I wish they had DDR at my gym.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
Anything that gets kids motivated to exercise is a good thing, I think.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
You know, we shouldn't be making fun of it.

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
But it is, you have to admit, the idea of an obesity summit,

55:39.000 --> 55:44.000
doesn't that seem the slightest bit condescending to you?

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Well...

55:46.000 --> 55:51.000
Hey, anything that gets more DDR machines out there, I mean, that's all I'm saying.

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
It's just like the parents telling the kids, you're going to summer camp, yay!

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
What camp are we going to? Camp Thin and Beautiful.

55:59.000 --> 56:04.000
You know what? I really think that it's a good start.

56:04.000 --> 56:10.000
I think it's a good thing, but really a lot of it is going to start with parental education.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
You've got to look at what the influences are on the kid.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Right.

56:14.000 --> 56:19.000
You can buy all the DDR you want, but at the end of the day, it has to be the parent that says,

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
no, you can't have a donut until you have mowed the lawn, or whatever.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Right, or eat your vegetables first.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
Yeah.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
You know.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
Alright. Well, we'll see what comes of that, and we'll let you know.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
We'll let you know how big of a score the winner of the DDR tournament racks up.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I had to, sorry.

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
Alright, let's travel the world and look at some upcoming release dates and games that are coming out soon.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
There's not a whole lot this week.

56:44.000 --> 56:50.000
This week, it's basically Call of Juarez the Cartel on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

56:50.000 --> 56:57.000
Also, Captain America Super Soldier, that's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
Wii DS, and actually, that's it.

57:02.000 --> 57:11.000
Then also, the Smurfs, in case you forgot, they have a movie coming out.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
There's the Smurfs on the DS.

57:13.000 --> 57:20.000
And because Ubisoft loves their dancing games, Smurfs Dance Party, which I saw a YouTube clip out there

57:20.000 --> 57:26.000
with one of the Smurf songs, Who Let the Smurfs Out?

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
I wanted to stab a needle into my ear.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
It seriously was terrible.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
And I also believe that, what was it?

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
Just Dance Summer Party will be coming out as well on the Wii.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
And that's it.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
I'm sorry, do you know what I have stuck in my head thanks to the whole talk about going to fat camp

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
and going to summer camp?

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
You know what I have stuck in my head now?

57:50.000 --> 57:57.000
Are you going to slit your shorts?

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
I hope we never part.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
That's a great idea for something.

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
And this has totally made me think of it for some reason.

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
Wouldn't it be awesome if they had some sort of social network thing where you could basically

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
create your own TV stations that people can watch?

58:38.000 --> 58:44.000
Actual programming, actual TV syndicated programming that you can basically design the lineup for

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
and have that play, and people would favor it and stuff.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
Doesn't Hulu have a playlist?

58:51.000 --> 58:58.000
It's funny, and it's huge this week too, the big buzz in the industry right now is Spotify,

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
the new music service from Britain that's coming out over here.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
They've rolled it out, it's all invite only and stuff.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
I got an invite, thanks to our lovely webmaster Jason,

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
and he got me an invite to the service.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
It kind of looks like iTunes, kind of mixed with Napster.

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
One of the big things is that you can build playlists and then share them on Facebook,

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
and anybody can call up your playlist and play the songs,

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
because it's essentially kind of Napster in that way.

59:26.000 --> 59:31.000
New Napster, not old Napster, but the new one that's subscribed to the service and get everything.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
But it's free for right now, it's limited to 10 hours a month or something like that on free,

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
but it's a good way to get exposed to some new songs.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
Kind of what you're describing to me sounds like that with TV,

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
because you'd be making a television playlist, right?

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
Sort of. I guess it's sort of like a YouTube playlist or something,

59:47.000 --> 59:52.000
but I was thinking it'd be kind of cool, because I've always thought,

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
hey, I've got some great ideas for TV stations and stuff as far as,

59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
hey, why don't they have an 80s TV station with 80s programming?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Well, 80s commercials for products.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
You could just have the Lysol commercial, whatever, from the 80s,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
but it's still advertising products that you have now,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000
or if people have products out there right now that they want to make an 80s-type commercial for,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
that'd be pretty awesome.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Well, apparently there's this, and you know how they used to have the Nickelodeon Game and Sports channel?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I don't think it's around anymore, is it?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
It used to show the Legends of the Hidden Temple and Guts and all that stuff.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Well, now there's a TeenNick channel that might have replaced that?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
No, it's been around for a while.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Okay, well, I guess TeenNick has a whole now 90s segment coming back,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
and they're going to show all the shows from the 90s on this,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
so you know I'm going to be camped out in front of TeenNick.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
My 33-year-old ass will be camped out in front of TeenNick when they do the marathon for this.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Yes! I totally watched the crap out of that show.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
What have any of these people done since it's set for her?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Isn't she on a show on ABC Family with Joey Lawrence or something?

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I think.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
She's done a few things.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Those poor parents probably don't get recognized for anything else than,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Hey, it's Clarissa's parents!

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Anyhow.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
True story, did you know that they made a pilot for a CBS TV show that was like Clarissa Grows Up or something like that?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Yes.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
That was something about her becoming a journalist.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It really had nothing to do with the old show, but it just was her.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
It would have been cool.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Yeah, but it didn't get picked up, so she went to do Sabrina instead.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Now we're talking.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Well, um, you know what?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Okay, there was another show that was on Nickelodeon when I was probably 19?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
But it was called, um, what was it called?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
It was like some soap opera.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
They tried to do, like, the Teenage Soap Opera.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Oh, 14!

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
No, it wasn't 14.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Or 15.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Yeah, 15 or 17 or something like that.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
It was one of those ages.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
15, I think, was the show.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Yeah.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And we're all the British programming that they used to have.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I just remember you can't do that on television.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
That was the greatest show ever on that network.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
The other thing that they did was introduce me to one of my favorite shows of all time.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Shut up, Moose!

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The Tomorrow People.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Oh, yeah.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Which actually was a BBC program.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
That's what I was talking about.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
It was a full serial, and the series had been around since the 70s.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
But I loved that damn show, and I watched the entire thing, and I've downloaded it.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Alright, let me move on.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
If it was out on DVD, I'd freaking buy it.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Alright, let me move on.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Uh, release dates for Japan.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Did I get from release dates to Clarissa Explains It All?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Yeah, that was my fault.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I don't know.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Welcome to Orange Lawns Radio.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Alright, on the Xbox 360, some games coming out very soon.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Alice Madness returns in Japan, as well as F.E.A.R., F3AR.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Final Fantasy XIII International Edition comes to the Xbox 360 as well.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I'm sorry, that's a price reduction.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Sorry.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
We'll only set you back about half as much as it did before.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
We're going to the, excuse me, PlayStation 3.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Alice Madness returns there as well, as well as F.E.A.R., and the Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
F.E.A.R. is F.E.A.R. 3.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
F.E.A.R. 3.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Well, it's F3AR.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
It's that whole stylized.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I know.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
It's stupid.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Like how Screen 4 had a 4 in there.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Alright, forget it.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Uh, No More Heroes, the Red Zone Edition, also on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
and Sniper Ghost Warrior this week as well.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Going to some of the other platforms, seeing what's coming out,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000
seeing if there's anything in Nintendo's world this week, be it the 3DS or what have you.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Let's see.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Well, the PSP has Grand Theft Auto games, Liberty City Stories, and Vice City Stories getting price reductions in Japan.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Also a game called Sengoku Basara Chronicle Heroes comes out this week in Japan.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
That is from Capcom on the PSP, and that is, let's see,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:55.000
brings back the two-on-two battles and all the famous scenes from the previous six installments.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:03.000
So I guess this is a long-going series in Japan.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Try to bring out Nintendo, see what's going on in their world, if anything.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
One game on the Wii this week, Everybody's Rhythm Tengoku.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So that must be Rhythm Heaven finally getting its release on the Wii in Japan this week.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
So a lot of people are curious what that will look like over here.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
There are a couple of big games on the 3DS this week.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Ushimitsu Monstro, Lense 2 Mahou Rhythm comes out this week in Japan.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
It's like a little monster rhythm game.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I think I've seen this girl in other games before, this little character.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Which one?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I've seen her before.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
It's Gabrielle's Ghostly Groove is what's coming out over here.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Thank you.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
It's a 3DS version of that.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
It's on WiiWare right now if you want to check.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
WiiWare or DSiWare. I think WiiWare.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And then next week, Super Pokémon Scramble comes out on the 3DS.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
So it's a Pokémon game even though it's not an actual Pokémon game.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
It's a Pokémon mini-game thing, I guess.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
It looks kind of cute, actually.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I'd check that out if it comes out over here.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
There it is, your Japanese release dates.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Let's move over to the old kingdom, Dark Sakura.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Not a whole bunch.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000
On the 22nd, we have Calabara's The Cartel in Cars 2, the video game.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
And Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
That's it.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I'm surprised it's coming out over there as Earth Defense Force.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
They used to call it Global Defense Force.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I'm gonna double check.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Yeah, it says Earth Defense Force.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Do they not like the word Earth over there or something?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Well, it was the fact that they were localizing it from Japan.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
So they called it Global Defense Force over there.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Oh, I see.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
It never really came out over here on PlayStation.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
So it's our fault for calling it Earth Defense Force.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
There were a lot of other series that were renamed just for censorship issues.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Sure.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Like Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Well, I'm also thinking about, you know what comes to mind,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
is the whole fact that Captain America is coming out in some countries

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
as the first Avenger.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Like, you know, Captain America is a bad thing.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
This is funny.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I know. No, I'm totally serious.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Certain countries are getting it as the first Avenger.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Hmm.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
So, interesting.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
At least they're not giving it the Hetalia treatment

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
where he's making, you know, he's eating cheeseburgers or something.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
A couple more news stories for you guys,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
then the classic game of the week.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
But first, Loki.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
You know, I'd be willing to see, like, you know how they have

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Italian Spider-Man, Italian Captain America.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Japanese Spider-Man is freaking hilarious, by the way.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Awesome.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
So, there is a new model of PlayStation 3 coming out,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
actually now, I believe.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And it's to conform to a new thing that was passed back in December,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000
the, what was it, the AACS Final Adopter Agreement,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000
which basically is some sort of DRM that they have standardized

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
that all media companies must adhere to.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And this means that they need to only support Blu-ray playback,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
high definition Blu-ray playback, only over HDMI,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
because it's the only way that this kind of DRM works.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:24.000
So, these new systems will be unable to play HD Blu-ray movies

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
over component.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
It's only going to be available through HDMI.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Games are fine.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Games you can still play over component,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.000
but you will not be able to play over component for Blu-ray.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And it's not something Sony is necessarily doing.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
It's something that everybody has to do.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
So, you know, if Microsoft has a new system coming out,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
you know, say that supports Blu-ray later on,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
they will not be able to have Blu-ray playback over component.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
What are you talking about, Loki?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
This is just because Sony is a bunch of cheap bastards.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
That's why this is happening, because they are cheap bastards,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
and they want to cut out the things that they're putting in the boxes

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
for the PlayStation 3.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Well, you mean cut out things that they're putting in the boxes?

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
That's what I read on the internet, so it must be true.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Well, that's what initially everyone thought.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Like myself, and come on, I wouldn't put it past them.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I mean, they've done things to cut out, you know,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
power usage and stuff like that.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
It really just saves them money on components.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
So instead, you're telling me that Sony just waited until the last minute

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
to implement their own standard for Blu-ray?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Not even really the last minute,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
because I don't think this goes into effect until 2012.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
So they kind of just said, hey, you know what?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
We're just going to do it now.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Before the Xmas rush.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Yeah.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
But here's the thing, though, is they didn't ever explain it to anybody.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And I don't think there's anything on the box, you know, that calls out...

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Well, I don't see Sony putting out a press release going,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
guess what? We've taken a feature away from the PlayStation 3.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
No, they don't have to say it like that.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
They can just say, due to blah, blah, blah, you know,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000
playback of high def Blu-ray movies can only be facilitated through HDMI.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
But, and then to be clear, though,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
you can still hook up your PlayStation 3 through component cables.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
It will only play the games and, you know, the movies in standard def, right?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Yes.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Hmm.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
That sucks. My old TV didn't even have HDMI.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I had to hook up through component, and it was an HDTV.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Thankfully I do have HDMI on my TV,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
and I am hooked up through HDMI for my PlayStation 3,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000
but once again, I mean, cause of HDMI cables are so damn cheap,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I don't understand why they don't throw one in there.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Oh wait, I know why, because they sell HDMI cables for $40,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
when anybody can go out and get them for like three.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Right.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Whatever. It sucks, but that's life.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Alright, anyhow, one more story for you guys.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
This has to do with a new Bimani game.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
For you fans of DDR and BeatMania 2DX,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:15.000
there's information about a new game that is being tested at Leisureland in Akiba, Tokyo.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
It is called Sound Voltex Booth.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
That's not vortex, that's voltex.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
It's like volts, like energy.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
There's some video that has hit the internet that shows this game in action,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
and apparently kind of what this game looks like.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
That's the little fuzzy music you hear in the background.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It kind of looks like, imagine like a BeatMania screen that's more like Guitar Hero, I guess, looking like that.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
But it looks like not only are there buttons,

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
but there's some type of tilt mechanism in this game too.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Cause you'll notice as the song goes on,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
the guy kind of has to drive and tilt the thing a little bit before he starts hitting buttons.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
So it looks like it kind of incorporates both those features into it.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Kind of interesting.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Boy, that sounds like crap, but that's what location test videos always sound like.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
So yeah, Sound Voltex is the new game on its way.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Some songs have been announced for the game,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
but they're all really some, there's a Max 300 remix.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
That's probably the only thing you're going to recognize by the name alone.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.000
So yeah, more information hopefully to come soon after the location test.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:25.000
So, Konami has trademarked some names, Sound Voltex Booth and Sound Voltex Floor.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Possibly localized versions of the game.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I don't know, I guess it would depend on how well this one does.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
So, we'll see.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Anyhow, it's time to take a stroll down memory lane in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Every week here at Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Sakura dives into the vault

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
and pulls out a classic game that she thinks,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
hey, why aren't you kids playing this game?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
It's awesome.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Enough with your newfangled crap.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Enjoy this old classic for a change.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
It is Tekken 3.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I figured since I did Soul Blade last week, I'd do Tekken 3 this week.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Because this was my favorite fighting game for ages.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:10.000
It came out in the arcade in March 1997.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
And it came out on the Playstation in 1998.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:22.000
There was a simplified arcade version that came out on PS2 as part of Tekken 5's arcade history mode.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
But the Playstation version is probably considered one of the greatest ones ever.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
It was the first game on Namco System 12 hardware.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000
And it was the last one that came on the original Playstation.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
It is such a fun game.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
This game came out when I worked for a Namco arcade.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
And I played the crap out of it.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
As far as the characters that were in it, it had basically,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000
you could unlock all of the classic characters later on.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
But it had its own new characters too.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
The ones that returned at the beginning were Paul Phoenix,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Nina Williams, Yoshimitsu, and Lei Wulong.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
And also you could unlock Anna Williams and Heihachi.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:20.000
And the new characters that came in were Jin Kazama, Shaoyu, Hwa Rang, King 2,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Eddie Gordo, who was every masher's favorite, and Forest Flaw.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And then you could also unlock Kuma and Panda,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Julia Chung, who was my second favorite person to use in the game,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Brian Fury, Gun Jack, Moco Jean, Ogre, True Ogre,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
and Tiger Jackson, who was the swap for Eddie Gordo with the fro and everything.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
This is the character I loved right here.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Hwa Rang.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Hwa Rang, he's awesome.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I love his music.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I'm going to turn it up a little bit.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I was actually really good with him.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
My three mains that I used were him, Jin, and Julia.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And I would use Julia every time I'd play against someone who played King

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
because she had a really easy move to break through King's infinite combo.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000
So did Jin for that record, and he had an easy to do unblockable,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
his little spin punch thing.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
You could dodge it though.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Now, in the PlayStation version, you had two other characters.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000
You had Gon, who I don't know if anyone's ever heard of the comic,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
and I will link something in the chat room.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Gon is a little dinosaur, and there is a manga, a big manga series.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And honestly, his ending and everything was pretty faithful.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
And I could also beat, what was it, Tekken Force Mode using Gon,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.000
which Tekken Force was like a little side-scrolling little version in the game.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
He also had toxic farts.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
And also Dr. Bosconovitch, who was actually supposed to be

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
an unlockable in the arcade version,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:06.000
but he ended up being a bonus in the PlayStation version.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
So there was another one that was for Blamecast,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
which was a boot disk for the Dreamcast

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
that you could boot the PlayStation version of the game.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I've got it, and it really just enhanced the resolution.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
It made it look a lot better.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000
But it also did sort of screw up some of the background images versus the stage,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
kind of almost how it did in...

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Do you remember the Japanese version of Tekken Tag Tournament,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
where it would do that weird thing between the ground and the backward stage?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Where they would separate? It kind of did that number.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000
But this is lauded by lots of people as one of the best PlayStation games ever.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
It got a 96 out of 100 on Metacritic,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000
and it's ranked the number 2 on their list of greatest PlayStation games.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Also, this was the music I really liked.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
It was the first LoLs music. So good.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
His ending was funny.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And yes, I have beaten the game, but never the win.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Now, this is actually a little bit of fun trivia.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Tekken 3 was the first game to get a 10 on EGM's revised review scale,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
saying that a game no longer had to be perfect to get a 10,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000
and the last game that got a 10 was Sonic & Knuckles.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.000
So it honestly is one of my favorites.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I have to say it is a masher's paradise, especially with Eddie Gordo.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Yeah, I loved him. That was awesome.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
See, I would only use him to play Tiger, because Tiger was so freaking hilarious.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
But the game had great music.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And I'll tell you one thing, actually, and this is actually fairly common with me

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
and the Namco games when they bring them home

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
and have their arranged version of the soundtrack.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I always preferred the arcade soundtrack, except for a couple of cases in Soul Calibur.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Not Soul Calibur, but Soul Blade, because I like Cervantes' arranged music better.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000
But it had fantastic music. It had fantastic graphics for its time.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Fantastic moves. I mean, it looked gorgeous.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And it was funny. My boss at Aladdin's Castle

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I worked at Aladdin's Castle in Mobile, Alabama. I will not hide this at all.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000
My boss, Anthony, he's a great guy.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
But I would always watch the Japanese forums to see who was going to be the next character to come out.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And they actually had a different release schedule

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
for the US machines versus the Japanese machines.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
So I would sometimes be able to guess, because they had this little screen pop up that says

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
guess who or who's next or something.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
And I would usually be able to accurately say who was the next character coming out.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
So it was pretty neat.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I would just play the crap out of these games. But I remember, and now this is

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
this game sparked a conversation that we had one time while I was working

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000
about how realistic are we going to see graphics become in the future.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
And he called it that day.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
You know, after a while arcades aren't going to be relevant anymore.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000
That you're going to be able to get that degree of quality at home.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Whoops.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And we were talking about just seeing how far it could go and I said

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
there's going to come a day where you're not going to be able to tell the 3D from the real thing.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
And now they've even got different types of motion capture so in advance

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
that you really can't tell the difference unless you're really looking for it.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
But as far as this

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
it is, I think to this day, my favorite Tekken game.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I mean I really loved Tekken 4.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I was still pissed off about what was that game, that company

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
that I gave the Better Business Bureau review to.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Because they sent me the Asian version and not the Japanese version

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000
of that specifically as to the Japanese version.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Was it Toys and Joy?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
It wasn't Toys and Joy. Toys and Joy has always been good.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
It was like import something.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
They're long since out of business.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
The other good thing about this one is that it had a mode called Tekken Force.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Which was a kind of side scrolling version.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
A beat em up like Streets of Rage.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
You go through different stages and if you beat

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
the mini game 4 times then you could unlock Dr. Bosconovitch.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000
You had to beat him first of course.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
It had another version that was called Tekken Ball that was like

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
beach volleyball. Except you had to charge the ball so you had to use

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
a powerful attack to try to hurt your opponent or hit the ball

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
so that it hits the ground. And then your character would get injured

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
if it touched the ground. Or the opponent's character would get injured if it touched the ground.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And it was just awesome.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
It was super fun. So you can still find it.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
If you get Tekken 5 it's in the history mode so there you go.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
One of the best games ever.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Alright there it is. Tekken 3.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Yeah because I like this character. The other one ran out.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
The PlayStation version. This is what Namco was doing. Look how we can render

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
individual hairs. And it looks so unnatural.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Oh geez.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Alright well that's going to do it for the classic game of the week. But don't go anywhere

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
because Orange Laundry is going to be right back with part B of our show tonight. We have some rapid fire

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000
news for you guys. Some news about PopCap got sold. We got to talk about that one.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Talk about some news around EA's camp when it comes to server shutdowns.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
And some discussion topics tonight. You know tonight

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
the news is a little bit light. But we're going to talk about is Good Parenting

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
better than a violent video game ban. I'm sure that will get everybody riled

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
up here in studio. And stop hating on sports games

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
says one writer. We're going to talk about all that when we come back with more tonight of Orange Lounge

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Radio.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Welcome back everybody to

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Orange Lounge Radio. The show where every gamer has a voice. We are back with

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
this part B of our episode number 420.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I'll just let that be. On this July 17th of

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
2011. So we're going to get back into some gaming

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
news including rapid fire news as well as your tweets. So this is your last

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
chance to get in those Twitter topics. Twitter.com slash o-l-r.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
But first I want to just give a quick plug for other projects and things that we're working on.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Of course the best little Hoard House in Azeroth is a Warcraft podcast

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
that I host with my buddy Ecstifer. For more information you can visit

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
www.hoardhouse.com. Sadly there wasn't a new show this week because there was

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
some other stuff going on. But we should be back next week. And so this would be a great time to catch up on

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
the what 31 some odd back episodes there are of the show.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And listen to our potty humor in talking about Warcraft. But never too

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000
seriously. I have a new impression by the way. What's that? What is nature's call?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I get sick of hearing it every time. Is that

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
one of the chicks in Warcraft when you get a quest? Arela?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
The centaur girl? Uh huh uh huh. Ah the great

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
outdoors. Yeah yeah I know exactly who you're talking about. Screw her.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Anyhow. How? Very carefully. You just got to get

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
those hindl- never mind. Anyway. Also I want to plug guest appearance I did

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
this week on Undersedation Live. Of course it was their 10th anniversary show. I talked about that

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000
at the top of the program. But fun. And a lot of the chatters were saying it was a very different side

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
of me. It was on that show. And I'm just saying well. It's not really about

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
games. It was the old Rob. I don't have to. It was still me.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I didn't like go in there with a different mindset. It's just I don't have to worry about. It's not my show

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
quote unquote anymore. You're different when you're not facilitating. Yeah I'm not facilitating. I'm not in the

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
MC role. And plus I realized on that show conversation will go anywhere

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
and anywhere. This show I've got to make sure after a 20 minute tangent it does get back to

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
the games eventually. But that show. Pshh. We should talk about whatever.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I was in the same boat when I was running the gig you know when Tiara

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
guested. Right right. So it's just a different role.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
When you have to be moderator. It's just like Julie Chen on Big Brother

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000
versus Julie Chen on The Talk. For those that actually watch daytime TV.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I had a Metal Gear style question mark pop up over my head just now.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Okay did you see the clip of the person that cried on the news

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
when they had to read the verdict that Casey Anthony was innocent. That was Julie Chen.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
But if you see her on Big Brother they call her Chenbot because she's like a robot every episode.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000
But first. This is very very robotic.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
But then she like cried so it was a big deal on the other show. Anyway.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Because they discovered robots have emotion now? Yes apparently. She got her emotion

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
chip put in. She can learn. Dark Soccer I don't know if you

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
can plug the stuff you've been guessing on. Uh oh.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Actually the podcast that Tiara and our

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
friend Weasel do for Geek Life is called Pop Culture

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Parlay. If you go to geek-life.com I am going

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
to be on the next two episodes. So yay.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Awesome. And it was a very interesting discussion and there

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
was some pyramid head mentioned. I'll leave it

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
at that. Great. So by the way it sounds like I didn't even realize

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
this but the chat room is telling me my audio cut out for a little bit there. I don't know if that's the mic or whatever.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
But there was audio issues so. Can you hear me now chat room bah bah

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
bah bah. It's not you I think it was me. Oh. I don't know what's going on.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Rob was talking about how he likes to do things.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.000
How sad I'm giving the plug for Undersedation Live and it cut

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
out. So I don't. Rob was on Undersedation Live guys and it was epic. Exactly yeah

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
there you go. Listen to Hoard House. Listen to Undersedation Live.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
And there was diarrhea involved. Let's not. Alright.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Let's instead. Should I go check on your coffee.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
I don't know if that's a good thing to bring up right after that.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Alright can we move on please with some rapid fire news going

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000
to and by the way Brad from Pod Culture

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
in the chat room says big difference between innocent and not guilty.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000
I don't want to get too political on this program or what have you or

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
talk about controversial stuff because you know I'll let what's her name

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
oh god what's that chick on the CNN show that

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000
oh god Nancy Grace that's that I'll leave that discussion

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
to her but fine I stand corrected on my earlier comment.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Let's get to some rapid fire news though. Loki why don't you start us. Alright.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Well there is a rumor that apparently during Comic Con

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
they're going to announce a new Marvel vs. Capcom

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
kind of iteration I guess or Marvel vs. Capcom 3

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
to be exact the actual announcement is supposed to be

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and it's supposed to include

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
a roster update including I think 12

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000
extra characters are supposed to be added to the roster and it

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000
will supposed to be I guess sold for $40

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
retail and some of the rumored characters

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
of course doctor Doc Doc because

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I guess there are some files that kind of referenced him in

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
the ISO that was floating around out there but apparently

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
there is a panel for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at Comic Con so it makes

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
sense that they would maybe make an announcement. Maybe they just want to

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
give out tips. Okay maybe not.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000
It's hard to believe that it wasn't that long ago that the game came out

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I mean February. Well Street Fighter 4 and

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Super Street Fighter 4 kind of the same thing happened.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
12 characters is a lot though. I mean that would be kind of cool.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Some other fun stuff. Apparently

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000
the Super Mario Brothers movie could have been a lot better

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
and some of the earlier drafts I guess of the script actually had it

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
a little bit more traditional to the actual Mario Brothers game.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
There was actually supposed to be some sort of epic boss fight

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
over lava and stuff with Koopa and a lot of

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
like you know the scenery that you would see

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
in the game will actually kind of take place in the movie. Also I guess Koopa

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
was flying around in a giant floating pirate ship. But

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
unfortunately what we got ended up being some sort of

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
weird Mario

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Judge Dredd movie. Wait a minute. You mean that executives came in

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
and fucked the whole thing up because they thought they knew what people wanted?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Aw I've never heard of this happening before. Not anywhere.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Yeah yeah I know. It's weird.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000
But that's what they did.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
And then finally I guess this is kind of funny. They actually had a

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000
dig at Capcom in

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Splosion Man. And it's during one of the levels

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000
that looks very much like the star road in

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Super Mario World. And they're all, who does this? I mean

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000
this is completely ripped off. What is this a Capcom game or

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
something? So it's funny. Nice.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Alright going to some other quick stories here. There's an epic

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000
mod on its way out for Starcraft. It's called Starcraft Universe.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
You might have known this previously as World of Starcraft. But then there was

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
the whole throw down between the creator and Blizzard.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Which ended actually pretty cool. I believe they invited the dude to hang out at Blizzard headquarters.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Like hey hey look we're not trying to be dicks but we have to protect our IP.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
You know kind of extending the olive branch. Well this was all back in

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
January when that whole thing happened. But now there is a trailer out with

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
gameplay from the alpha version. So I guess in a

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
press release that the dude sent to Kotaku he wanted to update everybody on

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000
the mod's progress. So yeah kind of interesting that it's going.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Let me play a little bit of that trailer here in studio so folks can see who that is.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I mean this looks like an epic mod for Starcraft.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
There's some cinematics there. I want to see if we can get some gameplay. Like when you look at the gameplay it really does

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
kind of look like World of Warcraft but in the Starcraft universe.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Which is kind of cool. Complete with like the

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
hit points for numbers and the whole kind of first person-esque

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000
3D environments. With the mini map

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
in the corner. I mean this feels very fluid the interface to somebody who's familiar with World of Warcraft.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I'm very surprised that Blizzard is not going to charge for this separate game.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Or somehow work that out with the creator. So I'm not sure exactly

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
how that's going down. But maybe there's going to be more about that

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000
at Blizzcon. I want to try that. Now the creator of this actually

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
left school to work on Starcraft universe for full time.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
He says at this point I'm learning way more creating Starcraft universe

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
than I ever would at school. Most of my friends trying to get into creative

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
industry find themselves having to grind out a massive portfolio to find any

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
work after four years of college. This is very true.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Wow that's crazy.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Blizzard would be dumb not to hire him if this ends up being a pretty awesome

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
thing here. So we'll have to see.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
We'll have to see how that works out. Also other

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
new stories. Incubus, you know the band, they're getting their

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000
own video game. It's called Incubattle.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
It's a beat-em-up that's very similar to Scott Pilgrim vs. the World

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
in that whole retro style. It's, you know what that reminds me of? Actually more so

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
than that. Remember the Linkin Park game that they put out in like IOS or something?

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Yeah. It's very much like that. There you go. Well you can pick one of the band's

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
five members and you go on the streets and fight. Who do you fight?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Pirates trying to steal the band's latest album.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Seriously? That is seriously who you're fighting.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
That's awesome. No indication on what

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
you can click on. Is this a flash game or something? I don't know.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Yeah it looks like a little flash game we can actually play there.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I'm not going to play that. I'm going to go cause physical harm

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
to pirates because they do physical harm to my wall. Well if they have the whole hats

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000
in the eye patch, that's actually kind of awesome.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Anyhow, Arkham City's collector's edition

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
has announced some pre-orders. GameStop and Best Buy both priced

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000
the collector's edition. Let's see, Best Buy actually went ahead and

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
priced the collection at $99.99 and

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
explained the content saying a premium statue, an art

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
book, Gotham Knight animated material, and interestingly enough

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
early access to download content. It all comes out on October

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
18th when the game is set to come out. There you go. Pretty cool.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Did you hear about that Incubus game, Dark Sakura? Yeah I did. The one you can kind of play in the browser?

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Yeah. Is that something you'd check out? I was crying in the other room. What do you think about

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
fighting pirates? If I wanted to fight pirates

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I would just fight the blood-sail buccaneers.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Alright, there you go. By the way, we actually have

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
a new Incubus single apparently has released to promote

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
the new game. Who would have known that this is coming out, but here you go. Let's take a

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
little listen here.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:33.000
But I just wanted to make one copy.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
There you go. Don't Copy That Floppy, the hot new Incubus single

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
that's going to be in that game. It's great. As you fight the pirates.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Is that interesting new sound for them? Yeah.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Well, here's some good news. For Sonic Generations

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
guess who's going to be there? Metal Sonic! And it's going to be

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
old school Metal Sonic and he's going to be one of the rivals.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I freaking love Mecha Sonic so that's really cool. That was

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000
actually my favorite part of Sonic CD.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
And then Konami. Yes, Konami again.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.000
They're giving us a choice. It's actually up on

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Xbox Live Arcade and PSN where

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
they're going to let basically the people

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000
who subscribe to these services choose the next game. It's on their Facebook

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
page so there's a question there. In a perfect world what previously released

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Konami Classic would you like to see next on the Xbox Live Arcade or PSN?

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Simpsons Arcade Game. Yes. No, I want YY Konami World.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And then last but not least Child of Eden is going to be

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000
on Playstation 3 on September 23rd.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
And it's basically

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.000
going to also have revised

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
versions I believe. There's the

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
there's some other games I want to say. There's Call of

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
War as the Cartel on the 16th of September World Rally Championship

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
2011 on October 7th and Connect to Party

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Rabbids Live and Kicking on 360

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
in November. Also Far Cry 3 and Brothers in Arms Furious 4

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
are going to be on 2012. The end.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Alright. Let's get to Twitter topics tonight. Every week we invite

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
your tweets at Twitter.com slash OLR because after all

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
it is the show where every gamer has a voice. Sometimes you want to ask questions or you want to

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
make sure we touch on a story at some point during this show or you just have an opinion

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
you want to share. We read your feedback in 120 or excuse me 140

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
characters or less. Ramaditya Knight tweets us

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
saying what is your favorite NES multi-cart?

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Mine is Supervision 110 in 1 and Super

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000
190 in 1. Oh god. Most of those multi-cart games were utter garbage.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Do you have a favorite multi-cart Dark Sakura?

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt. Oh you stole the answer

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I was thinking Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt. Actually maybe Tetris

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Duck Mario. That was a good one too. I was thinking Donkey Kong Jr. and Donkey Kong.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Loki? I really wish I had

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
played more of those pirated multi-carts because they had

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
some with like Final Fantasy 7

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
and the Titanic game. Oh god

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
yeah there's some amazing garbage in those carts. Well Ramaditya Knight

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000
gives you some ideas there. Supervision 110 in 1 and

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Super 190 in 1. My favorite multi-cart?

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Short Order and Eggsplode. They were power pad games. Anyone ever play those?

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000
It was awesome. One of them was whack-a-mole with your feet. That was Eggsplode.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Anyway. Moving on. More tweets.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Let's see.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Matt on Twitter tweets us and says

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Hey Toys R Us is having a $15 sale on all Tony Hawk

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
and DJ Guitar Hero bundles. Wow. That's a great deal.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
$15. That's an awesome deal. Like if you don't own DJ Hero

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
you might want to like consider that. Actually shit I would love to just pick up an

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000
extra guitar controller to be honest. Guitar Hero bundles? Hold on

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
I'm going to the source here. He's linking us to a thread on CheapAssGamer

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000
It works on the bundles but not the super

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
combo bundles. For Guitar Hero on tour. Oh yeah super combos would be ridiculous.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Guitar Hero 5 and Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock. Holy crap.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Yeah the super bundles I mean those are basically like you know

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000
all the instruments. That. I might have to do that. That's a pretty

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
damn good deal. I can't tell you this much. We had. We were clearing out some old inventory.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.000
We had $50. It could buy you the DJ Hero

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
party set. Our DJ Hero 2 party set on the Wii.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Two turntables and a microphone at a game for $50.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Is that where it's at? If I played on the Wii man that's an awesome deal.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Alright. Moving on. Tiger Claw tweets

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000
us a few things. One is a story about how Steam apparently has

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000
improved its content delivery system. Defense of the Ancients 2

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
will be making use of the new system when it comes out soon.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000
But apparently yeah it has to do with the fact that when new games come out on launch day

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000
from Steam sometimes the system kind of buckles under the pressure.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Those big sales too. The last day of that summer camp sale was pretty bad as well. Like remember

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Dark Soccer when I sent you the copy of the Terraria? Like you couldn't even get it at first.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.000
It was kind of crap. Well Valve is trying to improve the system

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000
especially for games that are in high demand and improve download speeds worldwide which is

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000
awesome. For those that have ISPs with monthly

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000
bandwidth caps Steam will no longer force you to download

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000
unnecessary data when a game is updated. You will just download

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
whatever has been changed rather than the entire files. Can't believe they weren't doing

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000
this before but that's a great improvement. Help cut back on some of the bandwidth

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000
overall. And you can also get into download

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
scheduling, bandwidth throttling, and the ability to prioritize

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000
the order that games are downloaded for updates and so forth. That's all coming

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
to Steam very soon. Now not everything on Steam will be able to use this right

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000
away but Dota will be the first game to use it when it comes

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000
out soon. Very interesting that they're pegging that as a game to use it

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000
soon. I had no idea this game was going to be coming out sooner rather than later.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000
I hope that's a good sign and not something I'm just misunderstanding there.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000
So, hmm, very interesting. One other story coming to us from

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Tigerclaw on Twitter and it has to do with Hideo Kojima

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000
and he says, you know what, I don't have time for a new Snatcher game.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000
But if someone else wants to do it, great. So it might be kind of opening the

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000
door there to a new Snatcher game. It was in an interview with PlayStation

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.000
blog when he was asked about games like L.A. Noire and Deus Ex Human Revolution.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Do you want to make a new Snatcher game? Kojima said, quote, L.A. Noire is a game

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000
that I really like but unfortunately I have not played it.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000
I think it is coming out in Japan today so when I return I intend

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
to play it. The idea of an open world in 3D is very good and I would love to do something

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
like Snatcher but I do not have the time or the means to do so.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
But if anyone else would like to develop it, I would love it.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000
So Team Bondi, you might need to give Hideo Kojima a call.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000
You might not even have to work 100 hour work weeks to get that game done. Who knows.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Anyhow, that is going to do it for Twitter topics tonight. Twitter.com slash olr

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000
if you want to get your tweets in for next week. In the meantime, back to gaming news.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Your phone calls in about 30 minutes here on OLR. The mailbag is coming up soon as well.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000
FUs of the Week and all that stuff you love. Loki.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Yes, this is kind of neat. EA bought PopCap.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000
I mean, thank god it wasn't Zynga.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Which they were in the running by the way. EA purchased

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000
PopCap games for 750 million dollars.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000
And then also of course there's some bonuses including

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.000
some performance bonuses I guess.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
They're worth another, I want to say 250 million or maybe

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
a little bit more than that. Maybe it's 500 million.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
But PopCap was actually

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
going to be, I guess Zynga had put in an offer for

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
a billion dollars and they got turned down. Which is good.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Good job PopCap. Thank god. Although I don't know

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000
why did they have to sell? Why were they so intent on selling?

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Wasn't PopCap doing great on their own? I kind of worry about this

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
relationship with EA. I mean, as long as PopCap's allowed to do their own thing

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000
then cool. But I got to admit, doing the show that I do on World of Warcraft

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000
it's becoming glaringly obvious that every bad thing that's happened

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000
in WoW is because of Activision now owning a stake in Blizzard. And I just

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I worry about this. Also speaking of WoW, it's upsetting that

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000
we'll never see any more of the free pay goal and free

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000
bejeweled mods that you have in WoW.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
That sucks because it's a competition with the Old Republic

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
and some of the stuff that EA's doing. But I don't

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000
know. I mean, was PopCap really so

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000
hard up for money that they had to sell?

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000
We wouldn't really know without looking at their portfolio though. Yeah, but PopCap

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000
their games are on every fucking system known to man. That's part of the charm

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.000
of PopCap. Plants vs. Zombies. Name me one thing you can't

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
play Plants vs. Zombies on. Let's see. Maybe an old

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Nokia phone and an Atari 2600. That's probably it.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I would bet somebody's probably tried to port it to the 2600.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000
So, you know, I just...

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Actually, yeah, you can play that in WoW because there's a quest. Yeah, Peace Bloom vs. Ghouls.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
I have my Peace Bloom. They'll remove that quest from WoW, watch.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I'm keeping my Peace Bloom. You better not take my Peace Bloom.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I don't think they will. I love my stupid singing flower. I actually hate

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000
those fucking flowers that sing because you'll be walking through Stormwind

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
and it's like, shut the fuck up.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000
I want a torch to set those things on fire, but anyway.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Why couldn't they give us one of the plants to look like Audrey?

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I want a zombie to eat that plant. Anyway, I digress.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I guess if it's a good business thing for PopCap then yay winners, but you know

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.000
there's always going to be that part of me that's a little bit nervous. A little bit nervous about what the future

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.000
has. Break room in our chat room

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000
at chat.orangelaungeradio.com. If Zynga bought PopCap games

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I would still be crying. Tigerclaw says, you know

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000
EA is going to be milking those PopCap games. Tigerclaw says

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Pagel Battlefield. I don't know if it'll get that bad.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I think EA just kind of wants something to fall back on if they're games.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000
It's not like EA doesn't have a humongous library of games.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
But it's nice to have some proven

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000
winners in their hat. And that would maybe be the best news

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
out of all with this is that if EA knows they've got a winner in their back pocket

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.000
then maybe they'll experiment with some new stuff on the other hand.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I mean I'm sure that's just wishful thinking on my part but

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000
forgive me for being a dreamer.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
People say you're a dreamer but you're not the only one. I'm not the only one exactly.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000
So there you go. Moving on

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
this is another story that's kind of about Zynga and it's about EA. It's interesting how these things

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
come full circle. This is about the NBA Jam creator

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Mark Turmel. He created the NBA Jam series that recently

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000
came back last year although it kind of came back with a pfft.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Hopefully the arcade ones this year will be a little better. He has left EA Sports.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
You know where he works now? Zynga. Yeah.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
So he now works at Zynga. So who knows what

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
he's going to create for them over there. He was assimilated into their collective.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000
He was the senior creative director at EA when he left.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000
NBA Jam is not the only thing he works on but you know some other projects as well.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Apparently there were rumors about a return of NFL Blitz

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
when this guy worked at Midway and then EA bought the

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Blitz property when Midway was going out of business but

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
I don't know if that will happen now or maybe it will just happen without this guy overseeing the project

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.000
anymore. EA has confirmed his departure. No word

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.000
what exactly he's going to help design at Zynga. I don't know.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I'm really trying to look at both sides about Zynga but does anyone

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000
else think Zynga's days are really numbered? And it's not just about the whole

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000
fact that their games are laughably bad when it comes to things like

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Farmville and so forth despite the fact that tons and tons of people play them.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000
But I feel like if Facebook goes down, Zynga

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
is fucked. Zynga has yet to establish. I mean I know they like

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.000
to say in their press releases, well people could just come to Zynga.com and play.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000
No one's going to do it. You're not going to be nearly the company you are thanks

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.000
to Facebook. What if Google Plus rolls out games and says

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.000
you know what? Since we don't like the Zynga games ever either

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.000
and we've become this safe haven for nerds, we're not going to partner with Zynga.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Zynga's not allowed to put their games on Facebook or on Google Plus

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
excuse me. Or maybe Google Plus will come out and say sure we're going to have games but it's not

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000
showing up in the stream or it's not going to do the same thing that Facebook did

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.000
where it shows up in feeds. It'll be like how I think how Yahoo

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.000
games were. It was just its own section.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.000
So you can go to that. Yeah it'll be how most people I think would prefer to see it.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Don't keep it off my stream. But you can have some cool games in their own little

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
games section. I played Lexulus for the longest time.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
It's going to be very interesting. And that's why I'm also glad to see

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.000
PopCap didn't go with Zynga. Although for Zynga's benefit, that would have been a huge

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000
win for them because at least PopCap can prove that they've done a bunch of other stuff

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000
in the other place. So there's at least that.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Alright, so let's move on with another story. Dark Soccer, what do you

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.000
got for us? Well, what I have is actually

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
a little bit more death.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.000
How's that?

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000
EA is going to be doing another

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.000
bit of online service shutdowns, taking down a bunch

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000
of multiplayer games and demos.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Army of Two, bye.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000
The demo, bye. Battlefield 2142, bye.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Battlefield 2 Modern Combat, demo, Medal of Honor

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Heroes 2, NASCAR 09,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000
NCAA Basketball 10, NCAA Football 10,

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Need for Speed Most Wanted, Need for Speed Undercover, Skate for Playstation 3,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Xbox 360, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10, and 11.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Those are all going down on August 11th. And on October 1st, Madden NFL 10

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
and NHL 10, bye.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Sucks to be the guy that paid $10 to play those games online yesterday.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000
I know, bye. I'm just kidding, obviously those games were out

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000
well before the whole $10 thing took off, but

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000
can't wait to see when the inevitable next wave of server shutdowns comes out and

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.000
something that you paid $10 because you bought it used a couple years after the fact to play online

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.000
suddenly shuts down. I know. That'll go over real well. I mean at least

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000
most of those games are like old sequels, you know what I mean? Like they're

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
old games in series that have newer sequels. And they probably have a good

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000
point. No one's playing those games online anymore. So they're not

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000
exactly, people are going to cry over them, but it's going to be very interesting

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000
when we get to the $10 games. Here you go.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Alright. Loki, what do you have for us?

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Ah yes. I mean

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
I hate when they shut down stuff. This is kind of cool.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Now I haven't really ever played this in the arcade, but I'm definitely familiar with the music.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Wagon Midnight Maximum Tune is coming to arcades

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000
number four that is, in December in Japan.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000
And I'm assuming we can expect more of

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000
the wonderful music in there. Some of the stuff that they

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000
are going to be, I guess adding, connected ghost

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.000
battle mode. So you'll be able to battle ghost records around the world.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
And you can challenge the top ghosts in the world.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Let's see. They're also going to have a team function. You can create your own teams. Put team specific

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000
stickers on your cars. And I'm not sure if that's

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.000
going to make the international version. New cars including the Mazda RX7.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
The Mitsubishi Starion. Nissan Skyline

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Coupe V36. And the Infiniti G37

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Coupe. The REF CTR Yellowbird. The REF

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000
RGT. Subaru Legacy B4 fifth generation.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000
The Toyota Crown thirteenth generation. And

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
yet unannounced car. Also some new courses.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Yokohama Line and Yaesu Route.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Both part of the Shudo Expressway.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
And they're also going to have some new parts. 22 new dress up parts.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Yay dress up!

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And then power up. They're going to have maximum power now.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000
130 horsepower. So that's kind of

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000
cool. I mean I don't know. I know that there's definitely

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000
in the arcade scene nowadays it's all about racing games.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I mean that's really popular. So it'll be kind of cool. Hopefully this stuff makes it

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000
over here. Yeah it'll be nice. As I was saying at the top of the show

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.000
that's a pretty awesome racing series. So I do hope we see that show up

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:13.000
over here. Alright well I'm curious to see what the OLR hosts

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
think of this next story. And I'm sure a lot of you guys are probably going to be on the same side as this guy.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.000
But I think this guy puts it pretty well. This comes from Charles

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Smith who is a professor of family studies for Kansas State University.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.000
He says that there's this big hysteria

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:33.000
about violence in video games. But it's context and the type of game that's

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000
important. The type of child is important as well. Here's a quote.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Quote, a child without a connected parent relationship. One who doesn't have

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:45.000
respect for their parents and plays a violent video game over a certain length of time

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.000
would worry me. But banning video games completely isn't the right

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
answer either. He goes on to say that banning games

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
might make them more attractive to children. Quote,

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:01.000
the realism in video games is changing constantly because of technology.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000
This causes more realistic violence and video games are becoming more and more

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000
immersive in terms of their nature. And he's talking about how you know

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000
the technology is always changing and this can kind of be a concern. But ultimately

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000
at the end of the day, he says that parents, they need to be educated. They need to be aware

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000
about what games they're letting their children play. Without that parent-child

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.000
relationship, children can go play whatever video games they want

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000
without that relationship.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
But with it, kids can play those games and not turn out

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
violent because the parents are still there to teach them right from wrong. And I say, well

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000
said, Professor Smith. Well said. And I'm sure most people here

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000
in the studio think the same way. Well said.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Too bad he's not the one. I say elect him for office.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:53.000
He knows what he's talking about. We need him to go

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.000
against Leland Yee in what is

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.000
needed for kids and so forth.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Alright. Let's move on with the mailbag and see what offensive

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000
things you guys are going to email us this week.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to email us every week and DarkSakura

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:17.000
will dive in head first and read some emails for us.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.000
I will. I have some. I have four emails.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Oh my god, four? Just kidding.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000
But first of all, person, you misspelled Voltaire.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
It's V-O-L-T-A-I-R-E. So if you're going to quote somebody, which

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000
I'm quoting Voltaire is fine by me. Make sure you spell it right, please.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Mailbag, hi, we haven't spoken in a while. I just wanted to let you in on this. I

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.000
came ahead quite a bit since I started a week ago. Just have a read.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Isn't that a spam email? No.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I'm telling you that's a spam email. You gotta

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000
watch out for that shit. We get tons of spam in the email box.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000
I should just ignore bed grammar anyway.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Hello, comrades. I'm sorry, it's funny that that still was signed

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000
with something that they're quoting a philosopher.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.000
I find that funny. I'm sorry.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Three emails. Hello, comrades. Hope that all of you are doing well. Firstly,

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.000
I wanted to thank you for the great show. Very entertaining. Just like shooting an AK

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000
while intoxicated. Just joking. I don't drink.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.000
What do you guys think of the future of GTA? Will the next installment be a serious and realistic

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.000
AKA gray and muddy as the previous one? Or will it perhaps return

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:37.000
to a much more hilarious style like San Andreas with much more customization and humor?

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.000
This is really a Loki question, if anything. Loki,

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I know you're rocking out over there, but Grand Theft Auto, what would the next one

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000
be like? Would it be serious or whimsical? I think that they're gonna try to

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:53.000
bring back what they did in San Andreas. Basically,

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000
kinda keeping it grounded a little bit, but have a little bit of extra

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
fun stuff like the miniguns and the parachutes and the little bit ridiculous

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.000
stuff. I think they gotta step it up a little bit as far as whimsical

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.000
and crazy because of Saints Row the Third, but

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.000
I still think they're gonna try to keep it a little bit

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000
somewhat realistic. I think you're definitely gonna see

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
kind of like a San Andreas. Alrighty.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
I just hope they get rid of the

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
I kinda call it like dating your friends, where

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000
oh hey, let's go bowling, or hey, I wanna go play air hockey.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.000
I don't wanna fucking play air hockey with you. I want

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.000
hoe mode. Darcy, I'm with you. I want more hoes.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I want hoe mode, where you play as a whore. I think there needs to be

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000
a mode where when she says I wanna go play air hockey, you should say shut up bitch and suck my dick.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000
See? And you know what? And this is why Saints Row

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.000
in some ways is a better game than Grand Theft Auto.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Saints Row 2 does have hoe mode, where you can play as a whore. You can

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.000
be a man whore, and you can go- Oh my god, why am I not playing this game?

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000
It's serious. It's one of the side missions you can do. I played the first Saints Row

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
and I was like, yeah, whatever. Oh my god. No, you need to play Saints Row 2. Saints Row- Can I borrow it?

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Uh, yeah. I need to be a man whore. That's awesome. It is

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000
a fucking awesome game. It's Saints Row 2- Did you play- You can borrow it when you lend me Dance

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Masters. Did you- Shut up. Did you play- Shut up, bitch. See, I'm practicing.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Hey, hoe. Did you play as a man whore?

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Well, I did the man whore missions, yes. Have you ever been a man whore, Loki?

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
No, but he's given a whore right now. In the game. And I gotta say, I was

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000
fucking awesome at that. You know why? Cause it's a rhythm game in there.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000
It's like, it's a little- I can't remember exactly what you did. It's something with

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
like moving the analog sticks in certain directions, like to like a beat. But

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000
since, you know- That's like Big Bang Bar. A little more to the left. But it

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000
seriously, uh, I mean, they have, you know, in Saints Row they have a

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000
mode where, I don't even remember what the hell it's called. It's basically you and one of those

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.000
bunny suits. You know how they have like the bunny suits? Mhm. Intel

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000
and stuff like that? Right in ATV on fire and everything you run into

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000
explodes. It's just such an awesome game. Oh god.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.000
This, this, I- If, if, if this game convinced

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Loki to get a gold star in man whoring, I've gotta check it out.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I'll loan it to you. It's, it's pretty awesome. But the third man, the third's gonna be

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.000
even better than this. It's just, I can't fathom how awesome this is

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:33.000
gonna be. Can't wait. Alright. Was there more

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000
to the email? Sorry. Yes there is. We're, we're stuck thinking about hosts. I also want to inform

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000
you guys of this great game I played as a kid. It's called Dark Earth. Okay, I wanna see how old

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.000
this is. If he's said he played it as a kid.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Uh, actually it links to something in archaeology, nevermind.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Oh, the video game. I'll find it. Hold on. Post-apocalyptic

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.000
action-adventure game for the PC. When did it come out?

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.000
It was cancelled for PS2.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Dark Earth 1997.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.000
September 30th, 1997. You were a kid in 97. Shut the fuck up.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I'm not reading any more of this. No. Um. Don't be mean to the

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:17.000
emailers. The amazing story and the graphics were pretty impressive at the time. If you have the time, check it out.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.000
You won't regret it. Stay frost comrades. Stanislav.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.000
I'm reading up on this game. I've actually never played this. It was a PC

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000
only game. I remember this game actually. I've seen it before. Do you really?

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I never played this. Third person game centering around item collection

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:37.000
of weapon based combat. Huh. The environments of the game were pre-rendered

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.000
with 3D modeled characters moving atop them like Resident Evil.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Huh. Interesting. It was pretty neat.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I will have to check it out. Next email comes from Robobobobobobobobobobobobobobob.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Thanks for the game by the way Robobobob.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
No the next one.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
No I was just saying thanks for the game.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Robobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobb

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I read the damn email. Did any of you see

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000
the Forza 4 trailer on Xbox Live? No. I watched it and it starts with this claim

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.000
all in game footage then unless I'm wrong it shows you the CG render

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000
to the game, followed by footage from the game, which I'm not sure looks any different

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:19.680
than Forza 3. CG renders are not in-game footage, even if they aren't part of the game media.

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:23.680
The only way that could be in-game footage is if there was a special car viewer section

01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:27.600
that does nothing else. I wonder if that is what it is.

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:33.920
Um, I, I, wasn't that the one that, like, blasted the Kanye West song when you watched

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:34.880
the trailer? I didn't watch it.

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:39.400
I did see it. It was, you know, well racing games always have, I mean, at least these

01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:43.560
days have pretty impressive graphics. It's, you know, a lot of it goes by so fast you

01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:47.960
can't really appreciate it. Well, I also have to paste, though, how Rob

01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:50.000
signed his email. Yes.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.920
Because you'll only get it if you know DOS. Oh, God. That's great. I like that.

01:59:54.920 --> 02:00:01.760
I love it. And to read it out for the listeners, 10 print Rob, 20 print B, 30 go to 20.

02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:05.200
By the way, it's basic, not DOS. Sorry. You know what I mean.

02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:09.000
Just so you know. I have an icon that says the home sweet home

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.400
one. I, I spent a lot of time on Commodore 64 basic

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:15.280
in my youth. Meanwhile, you kids, you kids were playing

02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:21.360
Dark Earth. When I was a kid, I was typing. So what were the commands? Like run, quote,

02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:27.400
game, quote, comma, eight, comma, no, asterisk A, asterisk B.

02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:30.760
You might've been playing Dark Earth as a kid. I was typing in programs from the back

02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:33.760
of compute gazette. Just so you know.

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:41.600
We had the, oh God, what was the, the, the Tandy book of, of, um, basic for the little

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:46.120
Tandy computer. I used to have one of those that you play

02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:57.040
games on. Okay. Last email. Dun dun dun. Um, hello gang. This is Ramaditya. I hope I said

02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:59.680
that right. I spoke to Rob earlier and as a blind gamer,

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:02.760
I would like to give my personal thoughts about one of the topics brought up in the

02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:05.440
last show. It is about an invention that could help blind

02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:10.160
persons see using connect as assistive device. I asked for an email like this. Hooray.

02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:13.760
However, because my English vocabularies are somewhat limited, I'll try to explain as best

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:18.160
I can. I hope you can catch what I mean. This is what I understand. In order to make connect

02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:23.400
work, it needs to recognize the visual objects it points to. For example, if I want to know

02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:27.600
that there is a glass in front of me, I must put my connect to it and an audio message

02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:31.840
will tell me there is a glass. It means that my connect must have proper information about

02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:36.000
the object so that it can recognize it properly so the object must contain something special

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.320
that the connect can recognize. With this aid, we are faced with the circumstance that

02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:46.240
visual objects are a lot, color, shape, letters, et cetera. So it is probably impossible for

02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:51.200
the device to recognize all of them. For example, if I stand in front of the mall, it will be

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:55.400
difficult for the device to identify various activities in front of me, walking people,

02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:00.640
sending children, moving trolley, et cetera. So the device may not be able to replace working

02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:05.280
eyes, but there is still a way to make the device useful and more effectively. We need

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:10.800
a specific object that can universally be recognized. What a coincidence that the idea

02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:15.880
came from Rob himself. Well, QR code can be one. That's basically QR code usually contains

02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:20.880
text or number, and those are universal, e.g. the numbers are number nine is the same around

02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:25.920
the world, letter A is also the same, and many other examples that you can make yourself.

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:29.580
So we use the device like a reading tool or transportation recognizer, and it's like what

02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:35.780
Rob told. When it scans the QR code attached to the bus, it would speak bus to Canada goes

02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:40.680
at 7 a.m. Another example, the inventor can install a small GPS so that it can help blind

02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:45.200
people navigate easily. You are facing north, the device says, and when you walk straight,

02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:48.940
it finds a QR code embedded at the next exit door that will read northern exit, go south

02:02:48.940 --> 02:02:54.240
to Dunkin Donuts. If you want to implement Kinect as a gaming device which is accessible

02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:58.520
for the blind, perhaps bodily movement can be considered as universal target that the

02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:03.360
device can recognize. Perhaps when you play one-on-one lightsaber battle, both players

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:07.200
can face each other and use a Kinect like a lightsaber, and the device held by the blind

02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:11.120
player can inform the position or movement his or her opponent makes. Combined with the

02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:15.800
sound effects from the game, it can be great. Another possible implementation is to use

02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:19.680
the device in card games like, well I forget, but there was that one PS3 one which came

02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:26.440
out with the physical cards. Oh. I have judgment. Yeah. That was the one where you all bet if

02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:31.400
I could sell one million and Loki must dress as Tingle. Yes, correct. The physical cards

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:36.560
must contain label or QR code that tells Kinect which cards the player holds so the player

02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:40.520
can use it properly based on the information given by Kinect. For example, this is dragon

02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:45.000
card facing up, this is golem card facing down, etc. Yep, that's my personal thought

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.920
about the topic, but I do support whatever result may come out. Okay, before I conclude

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:54.320
this email, let me give you my YouTube video. It's me playing frog's theme with my recorder.

02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:59.560
Hope you and all you listeners can enjoy it. Didn't he send us a recorder link before?

02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:02.640
I think I remember this guy. I'm going to copy it to you, Rob. Okay, do that. I'll bring

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:10.100
it up here real quick. Well, first off, I think if I understood the point of the email

02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:15.000
correctly, it was that I'm a genius for my idea with the QR codes last week, so I totally

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:21.600
agree with the email 100%, might I say. You're so awful. And I do have to say, if English

02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:25.000
isn't your first language, you still did a fantastic job. I know you did better than

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.720
some people who emailed us. You did better than people who have grown up here all of

02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:43.760
their lives, so thank you for being awesome. Let me bring this up a little bit. I love

02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:48.560
that because you know he's got a deep appreciation for this game. I want to say the last video

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:53.520
I saw of him playing the recorder was Scars of Time, I think it was. I think so. So clearly

02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:59.160
this kid loves his chrono. Yeah, he loves his chrono, and it's great that even though

02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:05.960
he's blind, he kind of has that appreciation, and I think it's hard for a lot of us to understand

02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:13.840
sometimes what it's like in that position. But certainly I can also agree that kind of

02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:20.640
what he says at the end of the email, hey, anything that will help is a good thing, right?

02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:27.520
Well see, this is kind of actually, it's funny because I was actually having this thought

02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:38.280
about the use of QR codes to provide, god this was, it's kind of a weird thought that

02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:46.480
I had, but you know how they have the reactive material that will raise and lower a certain

02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:50.720
way based on programming? I mean there is programmable material out there. Imagine having

02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:55.220
something that you could read a QR code and then having the braille for it for example

02:05:55.220 --> 02:06:03.040
show up on a small platform or on a stylus or something. Or even like an iPhone app that

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:06.840
you can hold up your phone, read the code, and it will have a speaker attached to it

02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:13.320
so it says so and so or record voice signal or something. What do you think? Yeah, I think

02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:19.000
we have all these technologies now like the QR code, GPS is so cheap to implement in devices

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:24.480
now too. I think we're just a matter of time away. I have to tell you though, and I'd actually

02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:31.320
like to get some of our blind listeners feedback on this too. I watched a special probably

02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:41.300
a couple years ago about using audio location to be able to tell distance. It was a guy

02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:48.200
blind from birth riding a bicycle down the street that had cars all around, people crossing

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:53.440
the street and making clicking noises. He was able to tell his location and what was

02:06:53.440 --> 02:07:00.280
close to him by the clicking sound. I was thinking if you had something sort of like

02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:06.760
Kinect that would attach like say to a bicycle or a vehicle of some sort that would give

02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:13.680
you an audio clue instead as you know like you said the GPS. You can have a GPS that

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:19.160
would also you know fill in your spatial items to maybe have like an emergency break that

02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:22.760
keeps you from running into something too. But my whole point with that is that if you

02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:27.600
have something like that implemented say into a driving game, then it could give the same

02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:33.760
feeling of driving without necessarily being able to see where you're going. Wow, crazy

02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:38.520
thought. But I got the idea from watching that show. By the way just real quick I did

02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:43.200
some folks are requesting the video so that they could watch it at full volume. So there's

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:46.560
a link right there in chat. I put that there. Sorry to those folks that are listening on

02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:51.560
the podcast feed but you'll just have to do a search for that. What was it labeled as

02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:55.880
and you can tell? Let me see, let me see what it's labeled as real quick here. Was that

02:07:55.880 --> 02:08:02.320
the last email by the way? Yes it was. Alright that was the last email. The name on YouTube

02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:11.360
is Ramaditya Skywalker. R-A-M-A-D-I-T-Y-A. Skywalker. S-K-Y-W-A-L-K-E-R. So there you

02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:15.320
go. You can look that up and I'm sure, I think he probably has, it's 61 videos so who knows

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:19.320
what else is in there but I'm assuming there's a lot of recorder stuff in there. So check

02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:24.200
that out. I see yeah Tin Whistle, Ship Final, yeah he's got some other videos too. I have

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:29.920
a Tin Whistle, I have two of them. But I'm not any good at it. Very cool. I should learn

02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:35.960
to play my melodica, maybe we could do a YouTube duet. Do a duet? That'd be awesome. Alright

02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:41.120
that's it for the mailbag. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send in your emails for a future

02:08:41.120 --> 02:09:06.880
week. Meanwhile let's get to the FUs of the week. I would like to say FU to my skin for

02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:14.280
not getting quite as much sun as I wanted today. But I am happy to say that I don't

02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:22.000
have skin cancer yet and yeah. Well Harada not having skin cancer that's a good thing.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.480
I'm trying to get a little bit more sun because you remember I've always been super super

02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:30.520
super pale and I decided that it's time for me to look a little healthier. I think I look

02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:37.080
healthy. You need your vitamin D. Yes. D for diva. I know. Well I was thinking Dan but.

02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:45.680
Loki do you have an FU? Just FU to people being sick. My FU of the week goes to this

02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:48.840
microphone because I think it's dying and I really don't want to buy another microphone

02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:55.800
but fine if that's what I have to do I will. And FU to I don't know my skin too, my skin

02:09:55.800 --> 02:10:01.340
sucks too. I have the whole like this is gonna be gross but I have like the whole like flaky

02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:06.840
thing going on in some parts it's gross I hate it. I know I use similar stuff I do but

02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:13.320
it only lasts so long and then it's like happens again. Well I'm the reason why I'm actually

02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:16.960
and I hate to plug. An FU to the outro playing right there that was too early. To plug you

02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:20.720
know because they're not paying us clearly. But since I started using I'm using the hoof

02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:27.060
maker stuff and it actually made the eczema on my knuckles go away. Funny enough my hands

02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:30.560
are fine. My hands never a problem. In fact I get a lot of compliments on my hands. But

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:35.000
I've started using it on my knees. And it I'm just saying it helped. There you go. Alright

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:41.000
well anyhow let's move on. Couple quick stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1877

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.880
game OLR. Loki. You know it's funny I was just watching video for some of the Saints

02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:50.880
Row 3rd stuff just because it's fun watching the video over and over and over again. They

02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:57.160
announced their hyper ordinary pre-order pack and this will be included with games that

02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:05.520
you pre-order I'm assuming anywhere but you know it may be just certain outlets but it's

02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:11.040
Professor Genki's hyper ordinary pre-order pack. It gets you a few things the Professor

02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:20.680
Genki suit which Professor Genki you don't know about the game it's this weird like Japanese

02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:27.160
game show within the actual game and Professor Genki is this really like tripped out looking

02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:32.120
cat. Kind of thinking like the Cheshire Cat. But you get this suit that looks like a stunt

02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:38.080
suit with that giant cat head. The Manipult car which is basically a car with the cat

02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:45.840
head on the front that has a giant cannon that you can get it a cat a bolt. It's a Manipult.

02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:53.320
You can suck people pedestrians up in to the cannon and fire them out. And then of course

02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:59.060
there's a weapon that's an octopus gun that fires octopuses that land on or octopi that

02:11:59.060 --> 02:12:06.400
land on people's heads. And if that's not crazy enough for you they have the platinum

02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:12.640
pack that's available which I'm seriously considering buying this. That comes with a

02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:19.400
headset that auto tunes your voice automatically. That's kind of worth it in the price of there

02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:23.660
and as well as the soundtrack and I'm sure some other fun bonuses in there as well. Of

02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:29.660
course the headset does not work with Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network. Well it does

02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:34.240
but you have to buy a little adapter but you know what it's still worth it to have a headset

02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:38.100
that auto tunes your voice. That might be worth it just for the show. I could do a whole

02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:44.160
show auto tuned. You know it's funny that the subject of auto tune came up on last night's

02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:50.520
under station live and you've got to check out this app on the iPhone. It's called songify

02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:56.120
and it's an app where you can like make instant songs out of like whatever. I don't want to

02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:01.960
rip off the bit from us all but I feel like now I have to demo it. So okay so here's songify

02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:08.160
and what should I sing about? Tell me what to sing about. Sing about hemorrhoids. Okay

02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:12.600
I'm not going to sing about hemorrhoids that's gross. Sing about. I'll sing a song about

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:20.400
Loki. Sing about Lady Gaga. No I'll sing a song about Loki. Okay here we go. Loki went

02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:29.880
to round table pizza and got a pizza with cheese and pepperoni but no bacon. Okay so

02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:36.160
now it's going to do its thing so here we go. Oh hold on. I did it wrong. It wasn't

02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:40.560
recording that whole time. Hold on. Live radio. I know live radio. Hey shut up. Hold on here

02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:49.700
we go. Here we go. Loki went to round table pizza. He didn't get the bacon pizza because

02:13:49.700 --> 02:14:02.800
bacon makes you fat. Okay here we go. Loki went to round table pizza. Loki went to round

02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:10.920
table pizza. He didn't get the bacon pizza because bacon fat pizza. He didn't get the

02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:24.040
bacon pizza because bacon makes you fat. Loki went to round table pizza. Loki went to round

02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:31.020
table pizza. So obviously it's not perfect because you know it kind of cuts out a little

02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:37.440
bit there but the duo is awesome. Songify you said? Yeah songify. It's free but I guess

02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:40.760
the way they make money is you can download other add-ons and so forth. Like for instance

02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:45.320
I just got one that says sounds like you can sing. Have you tried La Di Da? Rumor is Kesha

02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:50.120
uses it to sing better. Cute little things like that. Oh I have to tell you. You know

02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:55.240
how I talked about the blow video? I found out who the director was and he did some other

02:14:55.240 --> 02:15:00.860
videos that are freaking hilarious. This guy is like amazing. Hate on Kesha all you want

02:15:00.860 --> 02:15:04.000
but that blow video is pretty fucking rad. I know well that was the director. We found

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.460
the director's other videos. That's awesome. So anyway I had to say that. Alright. It was

02:15:09.460 --> 02:15:16.040
me and Becky and Susan in here just watching the hell out of these. It was so funny. Alright

02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:19.880
one more story for you guys here and it has to do with sports games. It's more of an opinion

02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:24.420
piece but since we're a little short on news tonight I thought I'd, by the way I'm loving

02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:28.640
these comments in chat right now. People trying to vote for that song in the cage match. You

02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:34.880
can't vote for that song. Stop it. What's it called? Songify? Songify. S-O-N-G-I-F-I-Y

02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:42.120
or something like that. Anyhow. Why You Should Stop Hating on Sports Games. It's an opinion

02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:50.280
piece that came from VentureBeat.com and talks about why sports games, you know a lot of

02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:55.420
the masses tend to hate on sports games. It's roster update and another fucking Madden games

02:15:55.420 --> 02:16:00.920
coming out. Who buys those games anyway right? Well a sports guru for Electronic Arts says

02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:05.160
as part of the story, quote, the point of our games is not reenacting throwing a football

02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:09.920
but the spirit of the sport and letting gamers fulfill their sports dreams. These are real

02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:15.560
players. There are real events and there is real angst. We want to reenact reality. The

02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:20.060
opinion piece goes on to talk about how sports games have a role in driving forward innovation

02:16:20.060 --> 02:16:26.320
for the entire video game industry and that's why you should take them seriously. I guess

02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:31.540
goes on to talk about NBA 2K11, the game that reenacts some of basketball's finest moments

02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:37.640
because that was the one that brought back Jordan in there. I guess saying that some

02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:42.320
people were too young to experience that back in 92 but the video game helps them relive

02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:46.860
an experience that they actually missed the first time around. The games include tons

02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:52.400
and tons of commentary from people that actually commentate on sports in the real industry

02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:56.720
and I think a lot that kind of went through this as well and it talked about that I thought

02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:03.480
made a good point is having to re-up the reality of these games every year. The opinion piece

02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:07.880
from VentureBeat.com says sports games are a main source of revenue for Electronic Arts

02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:12.680
so a lot of the innovation in terms of graphics and realistic physics happens in that department

02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:18.680
and trickles down to other games. EA for example uses the collision engines originally built

02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:23.720
in for Madden in games like Battlefield 3. Each year those teams build and rebuild physics

02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:27.960
and animation engines for their in-game characters and then other games reap the rewards of those

02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:33.200
engines. Physics and animation in our very core games have been very driven by sports

02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:37.920
games since the inception of the technology. That physics and animation had to be in a

02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:42.760
sports games for many years shooters didn't need it and then it goes on to talk about

02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:48.560
artificial intelligence is a big part of that as well when you play against sports teams

02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:53.520
and then that the sports franchise did start this whole once a year cycle but World of

02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:59.120
Warcraft does the same thing, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, DDR I would throw out there

02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:04.420
again. I thought that was kind of interesting. What do you guys think about sports games?

02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:09.000
Do they get a bad rap in the industry or are they important to the industry as a whole?

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:16.840
I think that you have to appeal to everyone's fandoms. I mean not every guy out there is

02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:22.400
gonna like you know to play the RPGs. Not every girl out there is gonna like to play

02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:29.240
adventure games. You know it's every they've got a market there. Sports especially well

02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:34.640
actually really all over the world I mean football is such a big thing in you know in

02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:39.160
Europe I'm talking about real football not the shit we call football here. That's an

02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:43.800
opinion young lady. I know I'm talking about opinion piece so I'm giving my opinion. Fine

02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:53.560
don't judge me. Judging a little bit. Sorry. Counter judge. But it's important yeah first

02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:59.520
of all it's a source of revenue. That means that you know for every you know Madden game

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:08.640
EA puts out we get another Sims. So it's a necessary evil. I don't have to like it. Going

02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:12.640
to our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrategy.com Tiger Claw says so all the nerds are complaining

02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:16.560
about sports games don't they realize that some of the most beloved video games are sports

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:21.520
games that nerds enjoy? Blades of Steel, Mario Kart anyone? You know I posted about this

02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:25.760
to my Google Plus and I got some really interesting comments and because I didn't say that I would

02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:30.400
read them on air I don't want to read them verbatim on air and but I will just kind of

02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:34.160
summarize one comment that I thought was very interesting was about somebody who said you

02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:38.560
know I really enjoy the sports games especially the football games and why I like them is

02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:45.440
that I can't really play sports game or I can't play football IRL I can't play professional

02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:49.980
football because I'm a tall skinny dude I'm not built for professional football these

02:19:49.980 --> 02:19:54.000
games let me live out that experience that kind of ties into what the beginning of that

02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:01.640
article said how you know it's about letting folks kind of reenact an experience I guess

02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:04.960
you could say and I can see the same thing with basketball you know you have to be a

02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:08.960
very certain body type to be able to really play competitive basketball but it's the same

02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:13.760
reason why people do fantasy football and whatever right Loki? I still think though

02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:18.600
they're they're dodging the actual problem with sports games and I'm not even just gonna

02:20:18.600 --> 02:20:22.920
limit it to sports games it can be a lot of games that feel that they need to release

02:20:22.920 --> 02:20:28.260
a new title in the franchise every year is the fact that they don't change very much

02:20:28.260 --> 02:20:32.800
year to year so that still didn't address the fact that when people call it just a roster

02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:37.820
update oh okay they tweak a few things to make things more realistic good for you why

02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:42.920
does that justify another $60 because I don't really think that you went back to the ground

02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:47.680
level and like rebuilt the whole game from scratch I think that you're just tweaking

02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:51.240
it a little bit to make it a little bit better but you know what tweaks like that can be

02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:57.760
done to older games and then patched in I don't understand why you need to release a

02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:02.680
game every year what about the idea of just throwing it out there that sports games set

02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:08.760
the bar so to speak that other games end up using like the whole physics and engine being

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:15.760
used in Call of Duty I don't think that they do I mean I've seen it well the guy from electronic

02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:21.440
arts said oh oh I'm sorry he's not biased at all you know electronic arts a company

02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:27.080
that you know my ton of its money off of sports games and they have some of the largest sports

02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:32.040
franchises out there would totally not be skewed towards sports games at all I he's

02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:36.920
gonna say well you're right our games aren't very realistic at all I think that every bit

02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:46.920
of game research no matter the type of game can benefit for example if you want a realistic

02:21:46.920 --> 02:21:51.520
physics for example a sports game actually is a really good judge of doing realistic

02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:56.040
physics for example you want to know how fully inflated basketball is going to bounce on

02:21:56.040 --> 02:22:01.360
a certain type of floor with a certain type of push you have to program all that in you

02:22:01.360 --> 02:22:07.560
know say that you take that into like for example Sims and they do suddenly they have

02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:13.080
like you can play basketball and Sims okay but I mean I'm but say that the same time

02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:19.680
you take like like an adventure game and you have a puzzle put in with it where you have

02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:23.600
to bounce said object off of a certain thing at a certain place what if they took this

02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:27.360
physics from a basketball game what if it was vice versa what if basketball game took

02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:33.840
the physics from there I think that it's a matter of your perspective I also call bullshit

02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:38.700
on the fact that they say that oh our sports games set the bar you know for you know level

02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:42.560
of realism and that kind of well if that's the case then you have these wonderful engines

02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:46.680
that calculate all these physics and stuff why aren't you using them for other games

02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:51.880
oh because you're not because the other game engines work just as well and you know what

02:22:51.880 --> 02:22:56.480
I would argue that the physics in those games are set to a realistic level that applies

02:22:56.480 --> 02:23:00.320
to the game you don't want super realistic physics for halo you want it to be a little

02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:08.280
bit you know unrealistic so that it's fun I mean no one can jump like 50 feet in the

02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:14.840
air and stuff like that I mean that there's a little bit of fantasy there but I mean if

02:23:14.840 --> 02:23:18.360
they really want super realistic games then why aren't they building no madden in the

02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:24.320
crytek engine or unreal 3 or something like that hell there is a you know was it backbreaker

02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:29.840
a game that had really realistic physics and that sports game didn't sell very well at

02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:37.000
all and I think that you know people yeah I understand there's a lot of people that

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.320
oh I can't play real sports so I'm gonna play this game that's fine I can't drive a race

02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:46.520
car but I'll still drive you know a car in a game I can't go murder people but also play

02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:50.880
you know a game like that let me read some comments from chat because chat rooms lighting

02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:55.000
up on the story and I think there's some really excellent comments in the chat room here from

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:59.920
all sides of the spectrum xena core says rob that's bullcrap the updates they do to the

02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:04.520
engine are no better than patches you really don't get your money's worth if you keep up

02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:10.200
year to year how often do your other examples charge full price for an incremental update

02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:13.800
break room and chat says I couldn't play in the NFL because I would pee myself if I saw

02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:18.840
some guy like Ray Lewis looking at me like he's gonna kill me he just might kill me every

02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:23.780
NFL game I have played has been different in some way sometimes there are slight differences

02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:28.940
dark Tetsuya says yeah that's why I love need for speed legally I can't really drive but

02:24:28.940 --> 02:24:33.120
I've always grown up loving cars and games like that let me imagine what it's like driving

02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:38.840
an expensive car I'll never own really freaking fast it's a really good analogy there break

02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:43.240
room also says I love Dragon Quest games and I will buy the next Dragon Quest game how

02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:47.360
much of those games really changed well hold on to be fair I mean you do have a whole new

02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:54.240
story new characters new environments new maps I mean I don't know if I really follow

02:24:54.240 --> 02:25:01.180
the DQ analogy because you know there is they're completely different story here's the thing

02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:06.040
I mean and let's let's talk about sports games here NCAA football one of the big updates

02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:11.880
this year was all the pregame rituals you know like the the different mascots coming

02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:17.500
across the field and in the little tweaks and stuff like that all stuff that you would

02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:23.160
say yes let's see the experience but not necessarily the gameplay I don't think that you know the

02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:27.480
fact that the mascot looks realistic and does we know whatever the mascot does normally

02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:32.800
in the game lends itself to playing a better football game you know that's the kind of

02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:36.460
tweaks that they're doing because how much can you really do with gameplay I mean every

02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:40.780
now and then yes they go back to the drawing board and they completely rebuild the game

02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:44.960
from scratch like NBA elite for example or whatever the hell they're gonna call it when

02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:50.640
it comes out in 2012 now that is going back to the drawing board but why did they go back

02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:54.160
to the drawing board not because hey you know what we need to make a better game it's because

02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:58.760
our game wasn't selling very well and then we made a new game and it really sucked and

02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:03.900
so now we have to go back to the drawing board it and you know what yeah you know I'd say

02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:07.460
the same thing with you know modern warfare I don't think that they really need to release

02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:10.820
a new game each year to their credit though at least there's a new storyline that goes

02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:17.340
along with it so there's a little bit something but I mean it's just there's but sports games

02:26:17.340 --> 02:26:22.000
though there's not really a necessary you don't need to write a new story for it it's

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:26.620
a sports game and to be interested interestingly enough wrestling I think the the gaming community

02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:33.140
rejected music games doing this you know our opinion with DDR and such is a little bit

02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:37.740
skewed because those were games you know we really loved but like games like Guitar Hero

02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:42.660
failed because the market was too saturated with them Rock Band essentially Harmonix has

02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:45.820
said you know what we need to take a break from Rock Band because you know Rock Band

02:26:45.820 --> 02:26:50.220
3 unfortunately didn't sell well compared because there were just so many Rock Band

02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:55.740
games coming out so I think it's sometimes these yearly update games get rejected by

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:59.540
marketplace anyway I want to read a couple other comments from chat and then go to our

02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:03.300
phone lines because I'm sure folks want to call in on this quickly Dark Soccer before

02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:07.780
I go to chat okay well I was actually there is an exception to the rule when it comes

02:27:07.780 --> 02:27:13.380
to the sports games and I really think it's the wrestling games because those if you keep

02:27:13.380 --> 02:27:18.080
up with wrestling it's like soap opera interesting because that's that is the one game I would

02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:22.940
not make the exception for but everybody everybody's got an opinion that's fine because like you

02:27:22.940 --> 02:27:28.500
know they they change whoever's popular at the time sure you know people you know there's

02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:33.740
a face turn or a heel turn and you've got to keep up with storylines and they try to

02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:39.500
recreate what it's like watching the show in the games so that makes sense to me all

02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:42.420
right let me go to the chairman chat that orange laundry.com for a couple more comments

02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:47.480
DDR dollar bill and our charm says I can't drive real cars but doing it online was awesome

02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:52.940
oh and flying sims are fantastic you know I gotta say even though I might talk about

02:27:52.940 --> 02:27:55.820
and I'll play a lot of sports games I don't play a lot of Madden because I'm not super

02:27:55.820 --> 02:28:00.380
into football I don't play a lot of basketball games because I'm not super into it although

02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:05.380
it is the sport I probably enjoy more than most others and I do love NBA Jam the old

02:28:05.380 --> 02:28:09.300
one I'm not as big on the new one but I'm curious about this whole arcade one they're

02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:15.840
putting out you know super high impact but one thing one game I love our racing games

02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:21.200
I love a lot of those racing games but I usually like the arcade racers more and I like the

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:26.940
realistic ones like I can't do forza I can't do Gran Turismo but I loved blur I like Mario

02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:34.820
Kart I really loved f-zero I will always love f-zero what about Initial D I like Initial

02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:42.700
D and I love I really like Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 so you know anyhow let's see also

02:28:42.700 --> 02:28:49.380
one other few comments here I love this comment from Tiger Claw sports games have been around

02:28:49.380 --> 02:28:56.500
since the first arcade game pong basically tennis interesting interesting point I like

02:28:56.500 --> 02:29:02.980
that and then let's see one other comment what I want to say break room says I love

02:29:02.980 --> 02:29:07.980
sports games but when I when I have ever tried to play in real sports I was never any good

02:29:07.980 --> 02:29:11.740
a skinny white guy doesn't line up well in high school sports but give me a controller

02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:16.940
and it's fun to pretend SSU 100 Matt says listen I've been a hockey fan for most of

02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:21.200
my life and used to play when I was younger I love the game of hockey so much that I gladly

02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:25.420
pay for the yearly update NHL games I enjoy playing the game because it's the closest

02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:29.380
I can get to playing with my favorite players and favorite teams than I can possibly ever

02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:34.640
get I would gladly play the pay the yearly $60 cost to play the game that I truly enjoy

02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:40.460
watching playing and being a fan of I guess we'll leave it at that if you want to send

02:29:40.460 --> 02:29:44.960
in your own comments for the future mailbag at orange lounge radio.com meanwhile let's

02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:49.240
go to the phones are going to open up the phone line right now 1877 game OLR or our

02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:54.160
username on Skype is orange lounge radio now that it works yeah now Skype is all better

02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:58.060
now it wasn't really broken last week just for some of dark soccer side projects it was

02:29:58.060 --> 02:30:03.260
a little screwy I guess on some of her guest appearances this week but hooray for other

02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:08.660
versions of Skype on the PSP and the iPhone and so forth again we're going to go to the

02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:12.360
phone here but while we wait for the calls to come in I will ask Loki quickly if he has

02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:15.700
any last minute stories he wants to share with us I don't know if there's anything that

02:30:15.700 --> 02:30:19.660
came up I don't think it was a very busy news week we might have hit one at all it wasn't

02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:25.940
there is a maybe there may have been one thing or two that we hadn't hit up on I'm trying

02:30:25.940 --> 02:30:38.860
to remember the hell they were though looking it up real quick here let's see I know there

02:30:38.860 --> 02:30:43.740
is something that we missed again 1877 game OLR or his name on Skype is orange lounge

02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:47.740
radio maybe maybe you know the story that Loki missed all right it's coming up I have

02:30:47.740 --> 02:30:51.740
a story what actually I do have a last minute story but we'll wait till after this call

02:30:51.740 --> 02:30:56.340
yeah let's do the call hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this yo guys it's Enoch

02:30:56.340 --> 02:31:01.240
or from the OKC how y'all doing hey Zina core how's it how's it going in the OKC man I'm

02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:06.860
pissed off man I went and went off to work I set my DVR to record the World Cup and of

02:31:06.860 --> 02:31:10.820
course to stop recording right before the shootout although I know how it ended I didn't

02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:16.740
get to see how it ended oh my god you miss you miss the the like it's so funny about

02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:21.500
soccer games that come down to that is like that like whole like five minutes is like

02:31:21.500 --> 02:31:26.820
the entire game right there that sucks it gets right before they start running out on

02:31:26.820 --> 02:31:30.300
the field and it's like this is the end of recording it's like oh you bastard I'll kill

02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:33.980
you sorry to hear it well how is OKC these days that's the city I haven't been to since

02:31:33.980 --> 02:31:40.700
I was 17 it's hot man I feel like going through the whole good morning Vietnam rant about

02:31:40.700 --> 02:31:44.900
it being too hot in Vietnam but I'll tell you the truth but you know after you've been

02:31:44.900 --> 02:31:49.500
in 130 100 is nothing all right like I guess we should bring it back to games though so

02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:54.800
what's on your mind about the gaming world today I've been sort of preparing for Dark

02:31:54.800 --> 02:31:59.380
Souls the best way I can that's why putting Demon's Souls back in my machine that's a

02:31:59.380 --> 02:32:03.460
game I need to go back and play more of Demon's Souls is so unkind though that game is that

02:32:03.460 --> 02:32:09.460
game is just not nice well this time I'm backing myself up with the wiki so the the Demon's

02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:14.820
Soul wiki they put so much information that thing is ridiculous so now I there's a plan

02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:18.780
what now I have to do is survive it why why do you want to play a game like I'm being

02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:21.420
devil's advocate of course why do you want to play a game like Demon's Souls because

02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:26.920
that game is too fucking hard are you a masochist sir no because you have to struggle to truly

02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:32.500
achieve anything and most of the games nowadays just hang you the ending on a silver platter

02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:37.660
oh snap all you have to do is oh I played it for 50 hours I'm almost near the end now

02:32:37.660 --> 02:32:41.980
there's no challenge in it you don't have to get better at the game to see the ending

02:32:41.980 --> 02:32:46.260
sir I think that might have been a dig at Final Fantasy I'm not quite sure no this is

02:32:46.260 --> 02:32:53.340
gaming in general man I'm covering the whole scope that's true that's true it's like I

02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:57.700
went back and started playing some old school select even like Star Fox 64 it has a certain

02:32:57.700 --> 02:33:01.660
requirement of skill in order to finish it you know granted that game is a you know a

02:33:01.660 --> 02:33:06.100
corridor shooter so there's some skill required but you can't just sit there and flip and

02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:10.100
smash buttons and get through it you actually have to pay attention to what you're doing

02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:15.140
and learn how to play the game so what do you hope they improve on in the next integration

02:33:15.140 --> 02:33:23.480
of the souls series hmm I think the only thing they could really improve on is maybe like

02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:29.360
if they didn't if they could get the whole environment into one gigantic street streaming

02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:34.980
level like just a big ass castle so that way although you can teleport to different areas

02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:38.060
of the castle you can actually walk the whole thing from one thing to the other that would

02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:43.740
actually be kind of cool oh god I you calling and asking about that game makes me really

02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:46.660
want to go back and play it because I'll tell you I didn't get very far even though I spent

02:33:46.660 --> 02:33:53.360
hours yeah you got to talk to panda she's the out of everybody in the all games community

02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:57.700
I could think of she's probably the one person I know of that's actually finished it wow

02:33:57.700 --> 02:34:02.020
finished yeah she's got a character like this is like level 120 or something so you know

02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:06.900
you have to put some time in to get a character that high yeah that's that's dedication that's

02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:11.640
indication well anything else in your mind this week uh no just that and that whole thing

02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:16.080
about the uh the the incremental updating for uh the sports games I mean if it was on

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:21.560
a pc you just get patches now and again for all that information I mean granted the fans

02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:25.340
who want to pay it just so they can have the updated team rosters that's fine but they

02:34:25.340 --> 02:34:31.380
just be just as happy if they got it in a patch isn't a lot of that crap also dlc uh

02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:35.120
it could be dlc too like for instance yeah an updated roster cost you three bucks or

02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:38.780
whatever they wouldn't have to release a whole new game it would be nothing but profit they

02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:42.600
wouldn't have to reprint or anything else like that you know now that the dlc has been

02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:46.180
pushed out there I could see them easily doing that but I don't think they want to like the

02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:50.260
exact most of the executives will do don't mess with the money you know so keep it coming

02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:53.620
the way they're used to paying for it and maybe we can keep that money coming in the

02:34:53.620 --> 02:34:58.180
way we want it all right all right so well I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more

02:34:58.180 --> 02:35:01.580

02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:56.540
already sounds really good I mean the trailer just has like a little like mix of the various

02:35:56.540 --> 02:36:01.780
songs but it's it sounds fantastic I really hope they release like a soundtrack cd for

02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:05.660
it oh like they did the other games yeah those soundtracks are awesome have you ever actually

02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:10.860

02:36:30.340 --> 02:36:37.540
the um the ps2 game the wanggun ps2 game it was like um Tokyo extreme racer kind of I

02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:43.900
have not there was one on playstation 3 that loki imported but it was it was not like the

02:36:43.900 --> 02:36:48.900
arcade games at all it was kind of bad actually what was the one it was wangin midnight just

02:36:48.900 --> 02:36:53.660
wangin midnight wangin midnight was the one there actually was one on the ps2 and it was

02:36:53.660 --> 02:37:00.640
released in the arcades as wangin midnight are and it was basically like a um uh Tokyo

02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:05.760
extreme racer type game and the music in it was different from like the standard trance

02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:12.300
music it was more orchestral but it was by the same guy yuzo koshiro so well yeah and

02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:16.600
yuzo koshiro he knows his orchestral stuff too uh he did the music for the game actraiser

02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:20.660
on the super nintendo which is one of the greatest soundtracks ever produced it's it's

02:37:20.660 --> 02:37:25.740
amazing my favorite yeah so he's a he's a very he's a very talented guy this stuff for

02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:30.020
streets of rage is awesome too of course oh yeah of course of course can't talk about

02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:34.420
yuzo koshiro not bring that game up did you get the streets of rage remix yeah I did get

02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:40.740
the remake before um Sega took it down it was I I loved it yeah um I actually played

02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:44.980
the um played it with a computer player helping me out and I forgot to turn off the damage

02:37:44.980 --> 02:37:50.180
between players so I ended up hitting the computer player more often than I ended up

02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:55.940
hitting the enemies nice last time I played streets of rage was on the sonics mega genesis

02:37:55.940 --> 02:38:00.780
collection or whatever for the xbox 360 no I have the ps3 one actually and it's got like

02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:06.100
streets of rage one two and three so it's a great deal and along with a shit ton of

02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:11.380
other genesis games it's great so yeah all right well any other games we should be looking

02:38:11.380 --> 02:38:17.580
out for this week um no nothing else I was just calling about one gun because I'm a pretty

02:38:17.580 --> 02:38:23.440
big fan of that and initial d initial d love it hey those those are the games like that

02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:27.380
are kind of keeping some arcades afloat right now with actual arcades as opposed to kitty

02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:31.360
gambling like you go to the local golf land here those are really the only games that

02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:35.120
made me stop and go oh I kind of want to actually spend money on this game because there's so

02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:42.100
much crap now you know that spit out tickets and so forth so the sad thing is um the newer

02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:47.620
initial d games like versions five and six they have not gotten like proper english versions

02:38:47.620 --> 02:38:54.300
because um sega just probably just gave up on localizing them and sad well the good news

02:38:54.300 --> 02:38:59.420
is the playstation 3 is region free so hopefully this new uh game that they're releasing in

02:38:59.420 --> 02:39:03.460
the arcades maybe we'll get a decent home version of it even if it's only in japan at

02:39:03.460 --> 02:39:07.300
least we can import it over here yeah I've been considering getting a ps3 because of

02:39:07.300 --> 02:39:12.840
the initial d game I've watched all of the anime pretty much it's fantastic you are really

02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:17.380
into these games then if you've gone so far as to watch the anime that's pretty cool yeah

02:39:17.380 --> 02:39:20.220
all right we gotta let you go to get some more calls but thanks so much for your call

02:39:20.220 --> 02:39:25.740
all right all right have a good one buddy and here's a hint don't go driving down a

02:39:25.740 --> 02:39:29.460
baron freeway to the soundtracks one of those games because you you might not uh realize

02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:32.980
how fast you're going dark soccer let me have you work in your story real quick here before

02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:39.520
I go back to the phone okay um the story is actually that the creator of vvvv made a super

02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:45.100
meat boy tribute sort of he did a super meat boy flash game that's in the style of his

02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:54.060
own game vvvv so um it's actually available at distractionware.com slash games slash flash

02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:59.620
slash meat boy and he says it's only a couple of screens long and very broken I can't wait

02:39:59.620 --> 02:40:04.000
for the next t meat game just saying let's go to the phones and take another call hi

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:08.780
you're on orange launch radio who's this hi yeah this is spazzinator hey spazzinator what's

02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:16.420
on your mind buddy uh a couple things actually um uh two talks on what we were talking about

02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:24.580
a few months ago with uh the whole ea constantly releasing new games yeah every well and in

02:40:24.580 --> 02:40:31.060
fact you had mentioned I believe why don't they just release yearly patches uh instead

02:40:31.060 --> 02:40:39.740
of releasing new games uh to to use that analogy this uh I'll ask a rhetorical question how

02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:48.660
much uh did dark soccer pay for the you know the 4.2 patch in world of warcraft nothing

02:40:48.660 --> 02:40:56.740
right right nothing well you know that uh that uh that uh you know that kind of illustrates

02:40:56.740 --> 02:41:03.420
the point that really you can't really charge for patches well they can update you know

02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:10.500
update uh mad in 20 billion times you know with patches spazzinator let me play devil's

02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:17.380
you can't really make 60 off spazzing maybe but let me play devil's advocate here for

02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:20.840
a minute though you could say that she got the patches free but you could also say she's

02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:26.080
paying 14.95 a month to get the patch because you know mmo's are kind of their own little

02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:30.980
beast because you do pay a subscription fee for most of them now granted some are free

02:41:30.980 --> 02:41:37.180
to play but they just make their money in other ways yeah yeah true uh perhaps I really

02:41:37.180 --> 02:41:44.060
picked a really poor example for my analogy that's right you know but um kind of uh well

02:41:44.060 --> 02:41:51.940
you even if you had uh let's say uncharted one you know the the patch analogy would apply

02:41:51.940 --> 02:42:00.340
because there's no monthly charge for uncharted but right uh but yeah now if they were to

02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:08.020
release you know the yearly increments and mad and on on desk you know with uh you know

02:42:08.020 --> 02:42:12.340
that and then yeah they can make their 60 bucks every single time you know it's kind

02:42:12.340 --> 02:42:19.140
of like uh I you know why uh kill the gold you know the goose that's laying the golden

02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:24.660
eggs or at least gimp it anyway when they can keep it nice and healthy and get all the

02:42:24.660 --> 02:42:29.300
golden eggs you know well it's kind of like making sequels to movies you know they don't

02:42:29.300 --> 02:42:36.500
release those for free so uh yeah I don't know yes yeah well you know one final note

02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:43.740
before I do uh let you go and sure so you can take uh just a quick update as to what's

02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:51.420
going on with my playstation 3 thing I know everyone's kind of asking about it so um well

02:42:51.420 --> 02:43:00.620
right now getting repairs temporarily on hold if uh if only because uh because of uh bureaucratic

02:43:00.620 --> 02:43:10.260
red tape with uh my social security disability payees office work uh offices uh I can't put

02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:16.420
in a request for the extra funds for like two weeks ago you know two weeks ago so it's

02:43:16.420 --> 02:43:24.140
always a money issue right now just just uh real life economical money stuff yeah and

02:43:24.140 --> 02:43:31.300
basically yeah yeah yeah uh you know apparently I need to do you know I have her do some paperwork

02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:38.500
and I have to sign data they got taken care of this past Friday but to be fair these are

02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:42.460
these are all things that have nothing to do with Sony to be fair these are all yeah

02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:48.460
so yeah but you know but you know you know and to make a long story short hopefully I'll

02:43:48.460 --> 02:43:54.980
have the money uh to have it repaired this week and once I get the money I'll get the

02:43:54.980 --> 02:43:58.260
ball rolling on having it repaired but all right well you'll have to let us know how

02:43:58.260 --> 02:44:01.900
that repair process goes once you get that taken care of so all right well fascinating

02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:04.420
we're gonna let you go to get some more calls but thank you for your thoughts have a good

can you check your connection echo one two three remember is a good thing to call sorry

02:44:47.260 --> 02:44:51.140
that was I apologize to listeners those drive me bonkers a little bit out of my control

02:44:51.140 --> 02:44:55.900
though I was trying to the call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey what's

02:44:55.900 --> 02:45:00.020
up guys this is sky judo hey guys you know what's on your mind buddy and I just want

02:45:00.020 --> 02:45:05.420
to say I just want to make two points um as far as the um the uh sports games just being

02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:09.940
an update roster type of thing yeah um I'm not I'm not the biggest sports game player

02:45:09.940 --> 02:45:15.020
I mean every once in a while I'll pick up uh the NBA 2k series you know just because

02:45:15.020 --> 02:45:18.300
I like that series but what I do notice when I do pick it up maybe it's just because I

02:45:18.300 --> 02:45:22.620
wait a couple of years before I pick it up they do add a lot more to the game especially

02:45:22.620 --> 02:45:28.580
on the multiplayer side like right now in um the NBA games you can actually play like

02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:35.060
you and four other uh people can actually play five other people online like you'll

02:45:35.060 --> 02:45:39.740
be like one entire basketball team and you could go up against another team of five which

02:45:39.740 --> 02:45:44.940
I think is great I wish they would put that in a baseball game actually have uh nine versus

02:45:44.940 --> 02:45:48.620
mine in a baseball game I don't know why they haven't done that yet I'm pretty sure they

02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:53.300
can do it but um you know they they they're pretty innovative is basically what I'm saying

02:45:53.300 --> 02:45:57.820
is that they they do add stuff other than just updating the roster you know what's interesting

02:45:57.820 --> 02:46:01.140
though is I do notice a common theme between what you're saying between what Matt's saying

02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:05.500
and between what I think I'm gonna say for us and our support of DDR over the years even

02:46:05.500 --> 02:46:09.860
when a lot of people didn't get it and that is you know in chat uh SJ100Matt said you

02:46:09.860 --> 02:46:15.740
know I pay 60 bucks a year gladly because I love hockey and this is how I get close

02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:20.380
to hockey and and for you it just sounds like you know it's replace basketball with hockey

02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:25.020
and for you even though the rest of us might look at it and go they don't even update anything

02:46:25.020 --> 02:46:28.740
in those games you look at it and go oh my god there's all these awesome new features

02:46:28.740 --> 02:46:33.100
that make it more realistic am I kind of right here that maybe not everyone gets it because

02:46:33.100 --> 02:46:38.900
not everyone is necessarily a huge fan whereas we look at DDR and we go oh but they've introduced

02:46:38.900 --> 02:46:43.060
now you can do marvelous as opposed to perfect as well and it's a new thing and you know

02:46:43.060 --> 02:46:47.580
not everybody gets that yeah yeah it just has to be a thing you just have to be into

02:46:47.580 --> 02:46:52.300
it to really notice that you know the some of the subtle differences and the major differences

02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:57.540
that they do make in a game so they do they do improve the game a lot so um yeah the update

02:46:57.540 --> 02:47:01.140
about something is kind of like a crazy argument and the other thing I want to point out was

02:47:01.140 --> 02:47:05.700
uh sports games do actually have a story I mean you you have to create the story on your

02:47:05.700 --> 02:47:10.260
own you know just basically using your own imagination kind of like an old D&D tabletop

02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:15.820
type of a game but um there is story I mean especially I can remember playing uh you know

02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:20.900
like Madden back in the early 90s when I was in my teens playing Madden right and me and

02:47:20.900 --> 02:47:24.460
my friends had stories we had rivalries going we had tournaments going you know it was like

02:47:24.460 --> 02:47:28.540
interesting you know we yeah yeah you know we were playing with a lot of emotion behind

02:47:28.540 --> 02:47:31.860
those games you know because you know so and so beat my ass last week so now I gotta come

02:47:31.860 --> 02:47:35.980
back and beat their ass and you know it's it's just a lot of fun to play yeah you don't

02:47:35.980 --> 02:47:41.540
want to fucking lose yeah exactly yeah all right those are yeah those are my two points

02:47:41.540 --> 02:47:45.900
awesome well good I think those are fair points I'm waiting on my prize I guess uh you know

02:47:45.900 --> 02:47:49.940
what happened we got a little slowed down I have it sitting here and Loki has to sign

02:47:49.940 --> 02:47:53.820
it because we got folks uh he ran out last week before I had a chance to have him sign

02:47:53.820 --> 02:47:58.260
it but we're hoping to get that out to you Monday or Tuesday so look out for it all right

02:47:58.260 --> 02:48:03.900

02:48:16.420 --> 02:48:19.940
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and PAL and I said you know what I'm just gonna give this

02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:25.920
to a listener I don't want it so I'm gonna give it to a listener I guess we could do

02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:30.100
one more call I'm feeling generous tonight we could do one more quick call so let's go

02:48:30.100 --> 02:48:34.380
