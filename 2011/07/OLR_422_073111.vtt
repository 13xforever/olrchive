00:00.000 --> 00:19.200
Tonight, July 31st, 2011, Nintendo slashes the price of the 3DS.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.200
The average price of an Xbox Live Arcade title is going up, and could the PlayStation 3 soon

00:24.200 --> 00:32.000
feature a doll?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.920
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.920 --> 00:38.840
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.840 --> 00:42.680
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

00:42.680 --> 00:46.000
first off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Hi.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
How are you, Miss Summers?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Um, okay.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I feel a little disconnected.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.240
Exterminate, why is that?

00:53.240 --> 00:54.760
Just a little.

00:54.760 --> 00:57.920
Because you've been playing WoW all week, and you feel disconnected from society?

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
No.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.800
When was the last time you had a Pinkberry?

01:00.800 --> 01:02.960
Actually, it's been about a week and a half.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.600
That's why you feel disconnected.

01:04.600 --> 01:08.080
Well, then maybe we should end the show early and go get Pinkberry.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.520
I'm down with that.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.520
Last week's show was a fair-a-thon.

01:10.520 --> 01:11.520
And that's the show.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.520
There you go.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.520
Goodnight everybody!

01:13.520 --> 01:14.520
Bye!

01:14.520 --> 01:15.520
Blah, blah, blah, Nintendo, blah, blah, blah.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.520
Ubisoft, goodnight.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.520
No, just kidding.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.600
All right, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.600
Hello.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.600
How are you doing, Loki?

01:22.600 --> 01:23.600
I'm doing great.

01:23.600 --> 01:24.680
Are you feeling connected?

01:24.680 --> 01:26.320
Are you on the grid this week?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.400
Yeah, I'm on the grid.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.000
I am so looking forward to hearing your thoughts on some of tonight's stories, as I know some

01:32.000 --> 01:35.600
of our listeners are, because we are the show, of course, where every gamer has a voice.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.720
We don't always get to report the news, but we're here to talk about it with you guys

01:38.720 --> 01:43.600
live in our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and of course, if you've never joined us for

01:43.600 --> 01:47.160
a live show, it's a totally different experience, I really encourage you to.

01:47.160 --> 01:53.240
Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, here at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

01:53.240 --> 01:57.800
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and we do have some folks in our chatroom already

01:57.800 --> 02:00.360
starting there, and let's see, what do we got here?

02:00.360 --> 02:04.840
SSJ100Matt says, this episode of OLR is brought to you by a higher debt ceiling.

02:04.840 --> 02:09.720
I hope they got all that crap fixed, but I hear it's still a stalemate, but I don't want

02:09.720 --> 02:13.360
to get too political, because I'll just get angry, because that stuff kind of has a direct

02:13.360 --> 02:17.120
impact on my life, if that starts affecting the unemployment and all that, like they're

02:17.120 --> 02:18.480
saying is going to happen.

02:18.480 --> 02:22.360
So let's try to move on to happier topics, like games, that keep us entertained when

02:22.360 --> 02:24.980
these things go wrong in our country.

02:24.980 --> 02:28.920
So DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with, how was your gaming week?

02:28.920 --> 02:35.440
Um, it was, I played WoW all up until the show, I was trying to get that achievement,

02:35.440 --> 02:38.680
the classic dungeon master, whatever.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.280
You know, achievements weren't around when you first started playing WoW, do you think

02:41.280 --> 02:45.200
achievements have kind of, clearly they were just ripped right off Xbox Live, but do you

02:45.200 --> 02:48.000
think they've really added something to the WoW experience?

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Well yeah, I think it's, you know, I mean, they don't really give you any, well yeah,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.400
some of them give you stuff, like you'll get titles for some of them, or you'll get pets

02:56.400 --> 02:59.400
from some, or mounts from some, those are the ones with incentive.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.800
Nothing that gives you a distinct advantage, but all the cosmetic stuff, Barbie doll things.

03:02.800 --> 03:07.120
Yeah, but I mean, it's kind of fun, you know, I'll get like a wild hair and say, okay I'm

03:07.120 --> 03:12.440
gonna finish this, and then it'll give me an excuse, because honestly, my favorite character

03:12.440 --> 03:14.800
to play is my 85 mage.

03:14.800 --> 03:21.080
I love my mage, and so it just gives me an excuse to keep playing her, instead of, oh,

03:21.080 --> 03:26.400
I can't really do anything right now, so I'll just, I guess, work on this other one instead

03:26.400 --> 03:30.000
of making another mage and leveling another mage.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.640
I don't know somebody though who has 8 level 85 druids.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.440
Well anything in the non-MMO universe that you've been up to?

03:38.440 --> 03:39.440
Groovecoaster!

03:39.440 --> 03:43.120
That game is fun, and I blame Shane.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.240
It's his fault.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.360
And Groovecoaster of course on the iOS, right?

03:46.360 --> 03:48.440
It's iPad and iPhone, right?

03:48.440 --> 03:49.440
Yes, 3GS and iPad.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.960
I'm assuming it'll work on the iPod, unlike Google+, apparently.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.040
Does not work on anything with the iPhone, which is a little silly, but.

03:56.040 --> 03:59.080
And the app really is not that great.

03:59.080 --> 04:02.080
It's more stable than Facebook's app at this point.

04:02.080 --> 04:07.600
But you know I haven't updated Facebook apps since they changed the photos, so I didn't

04:07.600 --> 04:10.400
update to that one because someone warned me.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.520
So I haven't updated my Facebook app in, like, months.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.520
Nice.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.520
And I'm not going to.

04:17.520 --> 04:22.640
I don't know what's going to come of all this little Google+, versus Facebook, especially

04:22.640 --> 04:27.360
when the inevitable games start rolling out, which I believe the early rumors said today,

04:27.360 --> 04:30.380
July 31st was the day they were going to start rolling out, but we haven't seen them yet,

04:30.380 --> 04:32.760
so maybe tomorrow on a Monday.

04:32.760 --> 04:33.760
Maybe it got pushed back.

04:33.760 --> 04:34.760
Who knows?

04:34.760 --> 04:37.120
It's going to be very interesting when the games roll out, because it's going to make

04:37.120 --> 04:38.440
the two go head-to-head even more.

04:38.440 --> 04:44.480
But right now, I think it's still too early to tell, but I think a little valid competition.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.000
And yeah, clearly everybody wants a piece of the social networking space.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.120
But you know, Facebook, or I should say Google+, has really succeeded at biting at Facebook's

04:54.120 --> 05:01.200
kneecaps in places where MySpace, Orkut, Buzz, even, and other social networks have failed

05:01.200 --> 05:02.200
to do so.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.720
Just wait until MySpace rolls out their even better game service.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.560
They're coming back, baby.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.000
Well, you never know.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
You never know.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.520
I mean, as things change ownership and things change hands and so forth, you never know.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.960
Don't ever count out somebody who's been gone for a while.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.680
I mean, look at Origin, right?

05:20.680 --> 05:23.840
Origin was an EA brand that kind of disappeared, unfortunately, because they used to make a

05:23.840 --> 05:25.480
lot of great games back in the day.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.800
And then the brand faded.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.080
Now it's back as a store.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.440
It could be interesting.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.040
Could MySpace come back as a store?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.040
Probably not.

05:33.040 --> 05:37.240
Anyhow, I just want to say, the competition, I think, is a little bit healthy for Facebook.

05:37.240 --> 05:42.920
Well, you know, they do say that festering piles of crap work as fertilizer.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.040
So maybe some weeds might grow out of that.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.160
But no, I've been playing Groove Coaster, which is basically across.

05:49.160 --> 05:56.600
It's like, it's kind of like Frequency, where you have the track, but you tap it and hold

05:56.600 --> 06:05.260
it, you know, the lines a lot like Oendon or Elite Beat Agents, but the lines keep moving

06:05.260 --> 06:08.960
and they'll sneak up on you and like the track will curve.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.600
And that has a very Vib ribbon type of vibe to it.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.560
It really just made me think of playing Vib ribbon, except, you know, you're just pushing

06:15.560 --> 06:17.800
little, you know, you're tapping along.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.640
And sometimes it's easy to figure out what the rhythm is, but sometimes it's really freaking

06:20.640 --> 06:21.640
difficult.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.880
I'm still kind of getting used to it, but it's got the first Arkanoid song, which is

06:24.880 --> 06:28.560
boop, boop, you know, that was pretty fun.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.680
And I actually got a little motion sick off of it.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.680
Wow.

06:32.680 --> 06:33.680
So I don't know that it'd be able to play it on.

06:33.680 --> 06:38.800
Well, it is very light, seizure-y, you know, fast emotions.

06:38.800 --> 06:42.440
It's on the parts where it starts spiraling downwards, then that's where I get a little

06:42.440 --> 06:44.140
motion sick.

06:44.140 --> 06:45.140
It's very interesting.

06:45.140 --> 06:47.320
I've been playing a lot of Groove Coaster this week, too, because obviously, you know,

06:47.320 --> 06:48.320
I love music games.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.320
It's a dollar.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.320
No secret.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.320
Yeah.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.360
I think the price might go up soon to three bucks if it hasn't already, but it's been

06:54.360 --> 06:58.320
a dollar that during launch weekend, it's been like an iTunes featured game by Taito,

06:58.320 --> 07:02.520
of course, seeing people that do Space Invaders, clearly the same team that did the last Space

07:02.520 --> 07:08.200
Invaders, not Space Invaders Extreme, but the other one that was on iPhone or iOS, Infinity

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
Gene.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.200
Thank you.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.200
It's still a buck.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.200
Nice.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.860
So I definitely, if you're a music game fan at all, you definitely want to check out Space

07:14.860 --> 07:16.720
Invaders, or excuse me, not Space Invaders.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.760
Well, you can check out Space Invaders, too, but a Groove Coaster is only a buck.

07:19.760 --> 07:24.760
And what I love so much about this game, it's the perfect phone game, in my opinion.

07:24.760 --> 07:28.000
It's everything you want out of a phone game, because...

07:28.000 --> 07:32.240
Except, you cannot sneak into the bathroom at work and play it unless you have your headphones.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.520
Well, yes, there is that.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.600
I suppose there is that.

07:34.600 --> 07:38.120
But the thing about Groove Coaster is that you can play it in short little minute and

07:38.120 --> 07:39.860
a half, three minute boosts.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.760
It's very pretty to watch.

07:41.760 --> 07:48.080
So it's that kind of like audio stimulation, visual stimulation, little diversion for just

07:48.080 --> 07:49.080
a few minutes.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.880
Or you could sit there and play every song and be diverted for an hour.

07:51.880 --> 07:52.880
But no trans vibrator mode.

07:52.880 --> 07:53.880
No, no trans vibrator mode.

07:53.880 --> 07:59.800
But I think in some ways, it's like just, it was designed very well with the phone audience

07:59.800 --> 08:00.800
in mind.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.920
And I think that's what's great about it.

08:01.920 --> 08:05.840
Because half of playing it is kind of just those visuals of going around the spirals

08:05.840 --> 08:10.080
and, ooh, ah, I'm in a trance for three minutes, wasting my time.

08:10.080 --> 08:16.680
Groove Coaster is a very good word because it really is like this massive galactic roller

08:16.680 --> 08:17.680
coaster.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.440
And it even shows you the track when you're done.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.440
So I think that's kind of cool.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.440
Yeah, that's cool.

08:22.440 --> 08:23.440
See the path you've been on.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.520
Yes, because there's a level later, I won't spoil it, but one of the levels when you see

08:26.520 --> 08:31.040
the path, you're like, it kind of fits the song and you're like, oh, now that's clever.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.560
I didn't realize that was, that's clever.

08:33.560 --> 08:34.560
Yeah.

08:34.560 --> 08:37.920
I really, I really had a good time with it.

08:37.920 --> 08:43.260
Like I said, I've gotten up to the first Arkanoid song, which is like, what, the second stage

08:43.260 --> 08:47.680
or second set of stages or something.

08:47.680 --> 08:52.200
And there's different, you know, I guess musicians that have worked on the tracks for the game.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.760
So it's pretty cool.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.000
And then that's really been about it.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.920
I mean, I've, I've had a lot of art projects to do this week, so I haven't had too much

09:01.920 --> 09:02.960
of the way of free time.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.600
I've done a lot of going to the gym.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.600
Working it?

09:07.600 --> 09:08.600
Yeah, actually.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.600
Yeah.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.600
I'm doing cross training now.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.520
Now at some point I'm going to have to loan you one of my connect games.

09:12.520 --> 09:13.520
Oh, you guys have connect or no?

09:13.520 --> 09:14.520
I have a connect.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.720
I haven't opened because I haven't had anything I want to play.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.320
Well, you'll have to try one of these fitness games that I was trying out.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.320
You might be into it.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.720
If you're all about fitness and stuff.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.720
I really want to try the UFC game.

09:23.720 --> 09:24.720
Oh yeah.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.760
I've heard interesting things about that.

09:26.760 --> 09:30.920
I don't know if I want to train to be an ultimate fighter, but, uh, I don't know.

09:30.920 --> 09:34.440
I mean, sometimes in these arguments, I got to take Jamie out.

09:34.440 --> 09:40.920
You know, I need to smite all those who oppose me with my mighty fist are all right.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.440
Uh, well then if that's it for dark soccer's gaming week, how was your gaming week?

09:44.440 --> 09:45.440
Logie?

09:45.440 --> 09:46.440
Uh, it was actually pretty good.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.920
I played lots of things.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.760
Um, so let's start off with the usual stuff.

09:50.760 --> 09:54.040
Of course played grand theft auto.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.480
Not much more I can say there.

09:55.480 --> 09:59.080
Uh, lots of versus defense force, which has been pretty fun.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.640
Been playing some co-op with my coworker.

10:01.640 --> 10:07.280
And then, um, then we had our company game summit thing.

10:07.280 --> 10:11.280
So some of the publishers brought out things for me to try.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.280
Oh yeah.

10:12.280 --> 10:16.360
You got, you got a little, little, little slice of E3 at your door this week, didn't

10:16.360 --> 10:17.360
you?

10:17.360 --> 10:18.360
Very small slice of E3.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.360
All right.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.360
Well, what'd you check out?

10:20.360 --> 10:21.360
Okay.

10:21.360 --> 10:26.920
So I played the newest build of, uh, connect star Wars and there's a couple of things about

10:26.920 --> 10:27.920
it.

10:27.920 --> 10:32.240
Um, they said that apparently they took, um, development staff off of dance central two

10:32.240 --> 10:35.680
to finish polishing up connect star Wars.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.480
But harmonics makes dance central.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.680
Yeah, but it's still Microsoft.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.220
Oh, Microsoft doesn't own harmonics.

10:43.220 --> 10:45.400
But they still have staff working on that.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
Okay.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.080
I'm a little, that seems a little, it's just, it's, or is it one of those disingenuous things

10:50.080 --> 10:51.960
where we moved some of the marketing staff?

10:51.960 --> 10:52.960
No, no, no, no.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.760
It has nothing to do with the development staff.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.880
It's the same thing as it's Lucas arts making the game.

10:57.880 --> 10:58.880
Yes.

10:58.880 --> 10:59.880
I understand that.

10:59.880 --> 11:00.880
Yeah.

11:00.880 --> 11:01.880
Okay.

11:01.880 --> 11:02.880
Okay.

11:02.880 --> 11:03.880
That's what the rep told me.

11:03.880 --> 11:04.880
I'm just repeating what I heard.

11:04.880 --> 11:05.880
A little strange, but all right.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.880
Especially different coasts to Lucas arts is over in the Bay area.

11:07.880 --> 11:08.880
Right.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.720
And then I don't know where their video game development houses, I'm assuming it's North

11:11.720 --> 11:13.640
Bay like the rest of Lucas arts.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.700
But uh, then of course a harmonics is out in Boston.

11:16.700 --> 11:20.440
So I'm saying I don't know.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.440
Okay.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.440
All right.

11:22.440 --> 11:23.440
Whatever.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.440
Fair enough.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.920
Um, you know, I'd have assumed it's more than just maybe one development house working on

11:25.920 --> 11:26.920
it.

11:26.920 --> 11:27.920
Whatever.

11:27.920 --> 11:28.920
Okay.

11:28.920 --> 11:29.920
So.

11:29.920 --> 11:30.920
Played a bit of connect Star Wars.

11:30.920 --> 11:36.720
They had, of course, you know, at comic con, uh, the new build had pod racing in it.

11:36.720 --> 11:42.560
And um, also they had, you know, the regular, just a little demo thing that you go through.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.840
Uh, yeah.

11:45.840 --> 11:49.840
You know, it's all right, I guess.

11:49.840 --> 11:54.840
But once again, it's just kind of, you could tell how well it's going to be just by looking

11:54.840 --> 11:56.800
at it and the videos and stuff.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.640
And it right for me, it plays okay.

12:00.640 --> 12:05.520
But like the stuff that they want me to do, like for example, in, in the E3 demo, you

12:05.520 --> 12:12.920
may remember the guy trying to, um, knock the ship off the side of the whatever and

12:12.920 --> 12:17.320
the walkway and he dropped it and then he, you know, brought it back.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.700
Yes, there's that problem.

12:18.700 --> 12:24.440
But I had a bigger problem because apparently they want you to knock it off the other side.

12:24.440 --> 12:28.480
You can knock it off either side, but they wanted you to knock it off the left side cause

12:28.480 --> 12:30.520
it's a lot easier to do it.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.120
So I ended up not knowing that obviously.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.420
So I moved it to the right trying to get it to fall off the edge of the thing.

12:37.420 --> 12:41.840
So I got it to the point where it's literally sitting on the edge teetering, not quite moving

12:41.840 --> 12:42.840
off the edge.

12:42.840 --> 12:46.320
And I'm at the point where I'm, why do I have to knock it off the edge?

12:46.320 --> 12:51.880
There's clearly like 20 feet of space next to it that I could run by, you know, since

12:51.880 --> 12:56.840
I'm a Jedi, I think I can be able to manage to, you know, fit my ego through that 20 foot

12:56.840 --> 13:00.320
patch of space there to, um, you know, get where I need to go.

13:00.320 --> 13:03.760
Or I don't know, maybe because since my character can force jump anyways, I could have just

13:03.760 --> 13:06.460
hopped over the goddamn thing instead of knocking off the edge.

13:06.460 --> 13:09.240
But no, the game wants you to knock it over the edge and before you can move on.

13:09.240 --> 13:14.140
So I'm sitting there like pushing at it, like tap, tap, tap, come on, get off the damn edge.

13:14.140 --> 13:16.660
Finally got the tip over and then I moved on.

13:16.660 --> 13:20.180
But um, yeah, the controls are a little bit wonky still.

13:20.180 --> 13:21.240
They're still working it out.

13:21.240 --> 13:27.180
And then pod racing, well, it works about as well as any Kinect based racing game.

13:27.180 --> 13:31.520
And you know, pod, pod racing would be something that I would imagine that would require a

13:31.520 --> 13:36.920
lot of precision, which the Kinect unfortunately just does not deliver.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.940
Let me read this comment from our chat room at chat.orangeonstrader.com.

13:39.940 --> 13:44.680
We have Doing Laundry Man is in chat saying, is Kinect Star Wars gonna be fun after a night

13:44.680 --> 13:45.680
of binge drinking?

13:45.680 --> 13:49.200
And that's kind of a similar question I have is that, you know, Loki, obviously you're

13:49.200 --> 13:53.040
what we would call a hardcore gamer, you play a lot of Grand Theft Auto IV and, you know,

13:53.040 --> 13:55.700
a lot of these other games that you take very seriously.

13:55.700 --> 13:59.200
Or you may be approaching Kinect Star Wars with too much of the hardcore angles.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.860
It's more something that kids are gonna really eat up and this is gonna be fun at parties

14:03.860 --> 14:05.420
and drunken nights.

14:05.420 --> 14:09.160
It's not like, I mean, it's kind of on rails, sort of.

14:09.160 --> 14:13.880
I mean, you can dash towards things and you can dodge stuff.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.860
But you know, all the gestures are very basic and you know, it's still very early.

14:17.860 --> 14:23.500
I mean, the game right now, it's probably not even in beta and it's, you know, July

14:23.500 --> 14:25.400
and the game's coming out in November.

14:25.400 --> 14:30.280
So there's still plenty of time, you know, to polish it up and it's playable.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.280
It's not terrible.

14:31.280 --> 14:34.760
I mean, it's just not something I would buy.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.260
But it's all right.

14:36.260 --> 14:39.640
It's just something that like if someone likes The Force Unleashed or something like that,

14:39.640 --> 14:42.100
they're not probably gonna get a lot out of this.

14:42.100 --> 14:44.260
Let's say Josh was 11.

14:44.260 --> 14:45.480
Would you want to buy it then?

14:45.480 --> 14:47.040
He'd probably dig it.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.040
Yeah.

14:48.040 --> 14:52.720
That's where I'm thinking this is going to, is that this is very much for the same audience

14:52.720 --> 14:54.800
that kind of supported the connect to begin with.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.800
It wasn't really the hardcore.

14:55.800 --> 15:01.840
It was more of the, I don't want to say soccer mom even, but just the family crowd.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.960
And thank God.

15:02.960 --> 15:07.880
One thing that they did get rid of, because it was really stupid in the demo, was the

15:07.880 --> 15:08.880
lightsaber on!

15:08.880 --> 15:12.040
You know, that was just retarded.

15:12.040 --> 15:16.480
Now you just put your hand out and the lightsaber comes out and that's it.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.320
Maybe you still could say lightsaber on.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.320
Yeah, I wouldn't.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.800
Okay, that would be terrible.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.920
So it was okay.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.720
Pod racing though, I was slamming the walls.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.720
But you know what?

15:26.720 --> 15:29.640
I blame that probably a little bit on myself because I didn't know how to control a damn

15:29.640 --> 15:31.640
thing.

15:31.640 --> 15:37.760
I went through the tutorial for the single player regular game portion, but the rep just

15:37.760 --> 15:43.400
put me straight into the game for the pod racing and so I guess there's dual throttles

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
on that thing.

15:44.400 --> 15:51.280
So I was just like, full speed all the time, maybe that's not the greatest thing.

15:51.280 --> 15:56.200
But the game itself though, the pod racing, it's very much like the movie.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.200
It's kind of cool.

15:57.200 --> 16:01.600
So if they get the controls correct, it might not be that bad.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.600
Do they have Greg Proops doing the announcing during the Star Wars sequence?

16:04.600 --> 16:07.440
Because I'll tell you, a shout out to one of my other favorite podcasts, Smartest Man

16:07.440 --> 16:10.400
in the World with Greg Proops.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.680
He was in Star Wars Episode I narrating the pod races, he was one of the two heads on

16:13.680 --> 16:14.680
the team.

16:14.680 --> 16:15.680
I think he is.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.680
Is he really?

16:16.680 --> 16:17.680
It's the same voices.

16:17.680 --> 16:18.680
Awesome.

16:18.680 --> 16:19.680
Yes.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.760
So yeah, that'll be cool.

16:22.760 --> 16:23.760
So it was alright.

16:23.760 --> 16:30.200
And then the other game I saw was Skylanders, which is the new Spyro game.

16:30.200 --> 16:34.640
And you know, I was just sitting there with the two Activision reps and one of them, I

16:34.640 --> 16:37.560
mentioned them like, you know, it was like $70.

16:37.560 --> 16:41.640
I mean really, you think people are gonna buy this, you know.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.160
And they think that it's gonna sell well.

16:43.160 --> 16:48.120
I mean it's kind of neat, I guess, for kids because you can just pop this little toy on

16:48.120 --> 16:52.680
there and you know, away you go and you can play as that character.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.120
And they're gonna have, I guess, 30 characters that you can play in the game.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.960
But the thing is that kind of sucks.

16:57.960 --> 17:02.480
You need certain characters to go access certain parts of the game, like you know, if you want

17:02.480 --> 17:05.780
to go underwater you can't use a fire monster, you have to use something else.

17:05.780 --> 17:09.400
So they kind of want you to buy the toys, which are fucking expensive.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.640
They're like $8 each.

17:11.640 --> 17:15.120
And you know, $8 for an action figure, that's not so bad.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.120
You know, G.I.

17:16.120 --> 17:18.380
Joe's, I used to buy those and that makes sense.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.800
But these are like, they're figurines.

17:20.800 --> 17:21.800
They don't move.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.120
They don't articulate at all.

17:23.120 --> 17:26.960
They're just not, you know, not, it's just mainly for the game.

17:26.960 --> 17:32.860
It's like physical download content is basically what this is.

17:32.860 --> 17:33.940
So it's an experiment.

17:33.940 --> 17:34.940
I guess it'll be alright.

17:34.940 --> 17:40.640
But I mean, if you're a fan of Spyro and you really want to play a Spyro game, I would

17:40.640 --> 17:43.840
check this out as a demo or something first, because it's...

17:43.840 --> 17:48.000
I was gonna say, I will admit, I kind of got sick of Spyro.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.320
Like Spyro just kind of got oversaturated, but I haven't played a Spyro game in so long

17:52.320 --> 17:55.880
that I think back to like the original one on PlayStation 1, like very fondly.

17:55.880 --> 17:56.880
This is not like that.

17:56.880 --> 17:57.880
Oh, that's too bad.

17:57.880 --> 18:03.160
I mean, it's like that in the world sense, but it's not, like Spyro looks fucking angry

18:03.160 --> 18:04.160
in it.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.160
It's just like he's...

18:05.160 --> 18:06.160
Spyro got more hardcore.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.520
He's like, what the fuck did you do to my games?

18:08.520 --> 18:09.520
I was so fucking pissed!

18:09.520 --> 18:13.040
You know, he just has this angry look on his face.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.000
They made him like emo-ragey.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.200
They're targeting a new audience.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.400
They're targeting angry people with money.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.320
So it was alright, you know.

18:21.320 --> 18:24.480
I didn't get to play Just Dance 3, because...

18:24.480 --> 18:29.000
Oh, I bet you're just, you're just torn up about that one.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.720
It was, Just Dance 2 was pretty fun.

18:30.720 --> 18:34.160
I played it, you know.

18:34.160 --> 18:36.600
Just Dance 3 on all the consoles now, or is that just Wii?

18:36.600 --> 18:43.800
She was gonna bring in all the Wii, bring a Wii dev kit, because she had that, but unfortunately

18:43.800 --> 18:46.080
they had issues with syncing controllers or something.

18:46.080 --> 18:49.400
I did get to play Ninja Gaiden 3, and that's fucking amazing.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.320
It's just such a great game.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.320
Really?

18:52.320 --> 18:54.360
Now, you didn't really play the other ones, right?

18:54.360 --> 18:55.360
No.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.800
So you weren't really ever into this series, right?

18:56.800 --> 18:57.800
No, not really.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.720
Okay, so you just randomly said, hey, here's a new game, I'll try it, and you're like,

19:01.720 --> 19:02.720
whoa.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.720
Hell yeah.

19:03.720 --> 19:04.720
It's just really, really violent.

19:04.720 --> 19:05.720
Of course.

19:05.720 --> 19:06.720
Of course.

19:06.720 --> 19:10.600
Because every time you, like, slash through somebody and you cut people, like, in half

19:10.600 --> 19:15.040
and stuff, it, like, goes in really close.

19:15.040 --> 19:20.160
Basically, they were saying, you know, that the theme this year was that they wanted to,

19:20.160 --> 19:26.600
uh, I guess, convey the feeling of slicing somebody in half, you know?

19:26.600 --> 19:27.600
Is what they're...

19:27.600 --> 19:28.600
Well!

19:28.600 --> 19:29.600
What they're trying to go for.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.920
Alright, now I'm bringing up a YouTube here so I can try and see some of this here.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.640
I'm just randomly finding a YouTube channel, hoping there's no narration in the background

19:35.640 --> 19:36.640
here.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.760
Ah, I don't want to hear this dude narrating.

19:38.760 --> 19:45.080
Let's see if we can find something else a little more.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.200
I don't remember there being alligators.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.480
This could be just some...

19:48.480 --> 19:51.480
This is just a YouTube spam.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.320
YouTube really needs to clean up their crap.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.560
Ninja Gaiden with 100% more alligators.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.560
Clearly.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.560
Clearly.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.480
I don't know if I'm gonna find it.

19:59.480 --> 20:03.240
Uh, okay, well, this one says G4 TV.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.920
We'll see how well this goes.

20:04.920 --> 20:09.840
I really don't want to hear Adam Sessler narrating over this stuff.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.280
And of course there's his timing out.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.800
Well, this segment's going nowhere.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.080
Live Radio Boys and Girls.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.080
It's awesome.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.080
I'll just have to take Loki's word for it.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.080
It's a pretty awesome game.

20:17.080 --> 20:20.920
Granted, though, that the difficulty was ramped way down because it is a demo and they don't

20:20.920 --> 20:24.360
want everybody to fail on it, but there is gonna be, like, I guess, some sort of casual

20:24.360 --> 20:30.000
gaming mode or, like, an easy mode or something you can play, so, um, but, you know, just

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
really over the top.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Fun game, though.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
So.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Alright.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Was that it?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Uh, yeah.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.640
Oh, did Ninja Gaiden 3 make you want to go back and play the other ones?

20:39.640 --> 20:41.520
Uh, no.

20:41.520 --> 20:45.360
Because Ninja Gaiden's not really a game I would think that I need to play the other

20:45.360 --> 20:46.360
ones, you know?

20:46.360 --> 20:47.880
Like, if you were to go play Ninja Gaiden 3.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.040
Well, yeah, but if you liked 3, you might as well go back and see what you missed in

20:51.040 --> 20:52.040
1 and 2.

20:52.040 --> 20:56.500
I mean, 1's, well, obviously there's, obviously there's the old, old, old what?

20:56.500 --> 21:02.360
There's the Atari arcade game and then there were the Nintendo NES games by Tecmo and now,

21:02.360 --> 21:06.560
you know, you had this new trilogy that started, I believe, on Xbox, was, because Ninja Gaiden

21:06.560 --> 21:11.280
was a huge exclusive for the original Xbox, uh, you know, and then, what, Ninja Gaiden

21:11.280 --> 21:15.400
2 was on, I think, 360 and that?

21:15.400 --> 21:16.400
Yeah.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.800
Well, and they also have the PS3 ones, the Sigma series.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.800
Right.

21:19.800 --> 21:20.800
Right.

21:20.800 --> 21:21.800
So, you could always check that out.

21:21.800 --> 21:29.440
Yeah, I mean, it's not, you know, not really something I necessarily need to do, but, uh.

21:29.440 --> 21:35.480
Uh, going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, uh, DoingLaundryMan in our chatroom says,

21:35.480 --> 21:36.680
chopping people in half?

21:36.680 --> 21:38.760
Loki finally gets to live one of his dreams.

21:38.760 --> 21:39.760
Oh!

21:39.760 --> 21:44.240
Oh, speaking, uh, just my, not really the chopping people in half thing, but I, I did

21:44.240 --> 21:47.960
remember there was a few other things, I didn't get to play, but stuff I learned, which is

21:47.960 --> 21:48.960
kinda cool.

21:48.960 --> 21:49.960
Okay.

21:49.960 --> 21:56.560
Um, Saints Row the Third, I got a little peek at, uh, cause, you know, I fucking love Saints.

21:56.560 --> 22:00.800
I know, you're just, you're just eating that stuff up with a spoon, you are so excited,

22:00.800 --> 22:02.640
you're gonna be there at midnight.

22:02.640 --> 22:07.000
No, a couple things about Saints Row the Third.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.880
One, I, I was looking at their, they had their kinda lineup of, um, their advertising campaign,

22:12.880 --> 22:15.720
so everything they're doing up from now to launch.

22:15.720 --> 22:21.680
And one of the things that's later on, not announced yet, um, is a new mode that they're

22:21.680 --> 22:25.880
gonna have, like, you know, all the other games have, you know, their kind of, uh, horde

22:25.880 --> 22:32.840
mode and stuff like that, well they're gonna have horde mode, as in whores, and basically

22:32.840 --> 22:37.040
when you turn in, you turn on horde mode, random prosti-

22:37.040 --> 22:39.040
Like, w-h-o-r-e-d mode.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.040
Yes.

22:40.040 --> 22:41.040
Horde mode, okay.

22:41.040 --> 22:44.160
Random prostitutes will attack you on the streets.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.160
It's awesome.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.080
I'm just like, yes!

22:47.080 --> 22:48.320
This game is amazing.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.360
Uh, what game do I wanna play today?

22:50.360 --> 22:55.080
I know, I wanna get attacked by prostitutes, just armies of prostitutes.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.360
Are they yelling things at you?

22:56.360 --> 22:57.360
You know, like-

22:57.360 --> 23:01.000
I don't know, but it's gonna be awesome.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.820
So that, that's something they're gonna be talking about.

23:02.820 --> 23:09.440
They're gonna have some sort of invite-only, uh, demo thing that my, uh, THQ rep says that

23:09.440 --> 23:13.360
they're gonna try, cause I'm such a huge fan, they're gonna try to get me into, and oh god

23:13.360 --> 23:16.480
if that would happen, I don't know what I would do.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.680
It almost sounds like you took that rep in the back alley and did what you had to do

23:19.680 --> 23:21.680
to get a sneak peek.

23:21.680 --> 23:25.160
Alright, he'll keep us posted.

23:25.160 --> 23:30.920
Uh, also go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com, uh, let's see, Spyro is in chat right now.

23:30.920 --> 23:35.840
At least somebody named Spyro is in chat saying, I'm probably the biggest Spyro fan here and

23:35.840 --> 23:37.640
I'm glad the game is like the original.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.160
I thought the Legend series brought it down.

23:40.160 --> 23:46.580
Uh, and let's see, uh, uh, Spazinator in our chatroom says, agreed, I was just playing

23:46.580 --> 23:47.960
Ninja Gaiden 2 the other day.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.800
The camera needs improvement to put it mildly.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.000
So, there you go.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.240
And Act Defta is hearing you talking about, uh, Saints Row the Third saying, best game

23:56.240 --> 23:57.240
ever, period.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.920
Hold on guys, the game's not out yet.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.320
What you don't wanna do, do not hype the game beyond your expectations because you'll only

24:02.320 --> 24:03.320
set yourself up for disappointment.

24:03.320 --> 24:06.880
Um, so, I'm just gonna tell you guys now, Saints Row sucks.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.280
It fucking blows.

24:08.280 --> 24:13.520
That way if it's good, you'll be- Sonic Generations sounds like it's gonna have a lot of fan service

24:13.520 --> 24:14.520
in it.

24:14.520 --> 24:20.880
Including, I guess, there's, um, different things that you unlock by beating, uh, certain,

24:20.880 --> 24:23.880
uh, challenges in each level, including some of the original games.

24:23.880 --> 24:27.200
You can unlock Sonic 1 in there and some other stuff.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.200
Interesting.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.200
Yeah.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.200
Okay.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.360
Uh, so, let's see, Sonic 1.

24:31.360 --> 24:35.960
How many times has that game been hoarded out in the past, uh, few years?

24:35.960 --> 24:39.160
Let's see, we had the Sonic Mega Genesis Collection.

24:39.160 --> 24:42.320
You could pay 400 Microsoft points and get it that way.

24:42.320 --> 24:46.880
Uh, now it's gonna be an unlockable in another game and that's not counting when we saw it

24:46.880 --> 24:50.400
probably back on the GameCube and every other collection known to man.

24:50.400 --> 24:54.040
I mean, how many times are you gonna pimp out Sonic?

24:54.040 --> 24:59.120
And I saw a new trailer for Dead Rising 2, uh, off the record or whatever.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.840
Looks fucking amazing.

25:00.840 --> 25:04.120
So in other words, Dead Rising 2, the way we meant to do it.

25:04.120 --> 25:08.240
It looks hilarious because the last few trailers that I've seen for it, it's just been kind

25:08.240 --> 25:09.240
of a teaser.

25:09.240 --> 25:13.360
This is just, you know, him wearing, you know, little children's clothing and just doing

25:13.360 --> 25:15.300
all sorts of weird shit.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.880
It's awesome.

25:17.880 --> 25:20.560
I love some of the random comments our chatters make sometimes.

25:20.560 --> 25:26.440
SSG100Matt in our chat room says, I think in the Bizarro world, Bizarro Loki likes playing

25:26.440 --> 25:33.440
sports games, MMOs, enjoys eating steamed broccoli, and looking at tasteful porn.

25:33.440 --> 25:38.240
I enjoyed MMOs and tasteful porn.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.240
So fuck steamed broccoli.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.160
Yeah, fuck steamed broccoli, that's disgusting.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.120
Alright, moving on, my gaming week.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.480
Not a whole lot of new stuff.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.760
Again, I've kind of been focusing on many of the games I already have.

25:49.760 --> 25:52.640
I've been playing those, including, of course, WoW.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.960
Been revisiting some old stuff.

25:53.960 --> 25:58.120
I was randomly playing some Super Street Fighter IV this week as well as Wipeout HD, which

25:58.120 --> 26:01.800
I finally looked at the Fury expansion, what, like two years later?

26:01.800 --> 26:07.520
You know, well, since in my household there's two of us and we share a Playstation 3, so

26:07.520 --> 26:11.640
I got two of the games, and then Salacious Pop got two other games, so he got the Wipeout

26:11.640 --> 26:13.200
with Fury in it.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.200
So that.

26:14.200 --> 26:18.360
And I played the Bomberman game because it's free on Playstation Plus right now, and since

26:18.360 --> 26:22.960
I didn't cash in the Playstation Plus until right at the end, I'm still on it.

26:22.960 --> 26:27.400
So Bomberman's free right now, and I played that, and it's...

26:27.400 --> 26:32.800
Bomberman was great, like, in 95, and now it's just, it's something that's better left

26:32.800 --> 26:33.800
to my memory.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.440
I forgot I signed up for Playstation Plus, ehh.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.840
Yeah, there's some free games.

26:36.840 --> 26:37.840
I didn't miss anything.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.840
Go get some trophies or something.

26:38.840 --> 26:41.440
Yeah, well it's free game, free until...

26:41.440 --> 26:44.000
Free until the third or whenever it wears out, I know.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.440
So you can check that out.

26:46.440 --> 26:50.320
Also, as far as other games I've been playing that are a little bit newer, I talked about

26:50.320 --> 26:52.880
Bastion last week, I said I'd only played the demo.

26:52.880 --> 26:57.600
I did end up upgrading to the full version, and I'm glad I did, I'm still enjoying Bastion.

26:57.600 --> 27:01.360
Some things that didn't show up in the demo, there's another weapon that I really like,

27:01.360 --> 27:05.680
like a sword weapon that you can throw, that's pretty cool, and you know, I've just been

27:05.680 --> 27:10.080
playing through a few stages of that, and you get some like training levels where you

27:10.080 --> 27:16.680
get upgrades if you can use your weapons effectively, like there's one that is shoot all these little

27:16.680 --> 27:20.740
pods with the least number of arrows possible, and it's just kind of interesting, it's like

27:20.740 --> 27:24.520
half puzzle, half action, kind of neat, and then there was like another one I unlocked

27:24.520 --> 27:28.000
later that was, you know, how fast can you slice everything up with your sword, which

27:28.000 --> 27:31.200
is kind of cool, a little bit of a button mash, but in a fun way.

27:31.200 --> 27:35.280
So yeah, I'm enjoying Bastion, so if you haven't checked that out, and especially if you like

27:35.280 --> 27:39.320
kind of the old school platformers, I love that it's kind of like an old school platformer

27:39.320 --> 27:43.600
with a very new school twist of the way the story is told, so I think it's pretty awesome.

27:43.600 --> 27:48.720
I also checked out From Dust, this is just a demo, so again, these are impressions based

27:48.720 --> 27:54.960
on a demo, I had heard it was like the old game's populace, which I loved that game back

27:54.960 --> 28:00.040
in the day, so I was all about ready to try this, and I checked out the demo and it's

28:00.040 --> 28:08.720
very, the way it's presented, the presentation of the game is great, I mean, everything is

28:08.720 --> 28:13.240
very gorgeous, everything is well done, and the way it's put together, it felt like a

28:13.240 --> 28:17.600
disc based game, honestly, I'm really surprised they packed all this into an arcade release,

28:17.600 --> 28:22.840
although I think it was like a gig download, so I mean, and some 360 games are like several

28:22.840 --> 28:25.720
hundred megs, so this is almost as big as a disc game.

28:25.720 --> 28:29.720
I will say where I got frustrated though is that I honestly found the demo, I couldn't

28:29.720 --> 28:33.520
really get past one of the stages in the demo, and I found it really frustrating because

28:33.520 --> 28:38.240
the way I was laying down the sand or something was just not right, I mean, maybe I just need

28:38.240 --> 28:41.760
to approach it again with a clear head, but it was one of those points of early frustration

28:41.760 --> 28:45.480
where I'm like, well shit, if I can't beat the demo, then I ain't wasting my money on

28:45.480 --> 28:51.600
the full game, but I liked where it was going, so I can't really say it reflects on the game

28:51.600 --> 28:56.380
negatively, I think it's just one of those, try this for yourself, because it's something

28:56.380 --> 29:00.080
you have to experience, but it's not really for everybody.

29:00.080 --> 29:04.480
So that's the beautiful thing about Arcade, there's demos of every game, so if you like

29:04.480 --> 29:10.360
those types of games like Populous, I'm trying to think what else, maybe Lemmings-esque,

29:10.360 --> 29:16.760
I kind of reminded of that a little bit, you might enjoy this game, so check that out.

29:16.760 --> 29:22.640
That's really otherwise about it, I want to get my classic game on next weekend, I was

29:22.640 --> 29:27.680
talking to Salacious Pop about wanting to hook up the Dreamcast to play the NES emulator

29:27.680 --> 29:30.440
to go play some old games, so I might do some of that this weekend.

29:30.440 --> 29:34.520
I forgot a game I played this week, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.520
Oh my gosh.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.200
Wow, old school, where the hell did that come from?

29:39.200 --> 29:40.200
Wasn't that on Sega CD?

29:40.200 --> 29:42.200
I think there was a version on Sega CD.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.960
I think there was a version on Genesis though.

29:43.960 --> 29:50.520
I played it on my arcade cabinet, it was fun, I don't know, I just wanted to play a beat

29:50.520 --> 29:57.320
em up game that wasn't Ninja Turtles or something I'd played before, so Cadillacs and Dinosaurs

29:57.320 --> 29:58.320
it was.

29:58.320 --> 30:02.000
And there's a character in there that looks just like Blanca, except he has a tail and

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
weird eyes.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.040
By the way, Rob, didn't we give you a NES?

30:08.040 --> 30:09.040
You did.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.040
Okay.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.040
But I don't have a lot of carts.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.040
I have some.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.560
I was going to say, I'd be more than happy to do some games.

30:14.560 --> 30:15.560
We'll see, we'll see.

30:15.560 --> 30:18.960
So that you can have the excitement of blowing into the cartridges and then into the machine

30:18.960 --> 30:19.960
and then swabbing them.

30:19.960 --> 30:24.120
Going to our chatroom at chat.org.com, some comments from our chat, Black Wolf, the man

30:24.120 --> 30:28.280
before us, Sunday nights at all games is in chat saying, Sky, take out the narrator.

30:28.280 --> 30:30.680
Is Bastion still worth it?

30:30.680 --> 30:32.080
Yes.

30:32.080 --> 30:36.000
But keep in mind, you know, every gamer is a little different.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.720
And I really like these isometric platformy type of games.

30:40.720 --> 30:45.600
You know, some of my favorite games going back to the NES, the Super NES era are Solstice

30:45.600 --> 30:47.320
and Equinox and that series.

30:47.320 --> 30:52.160
And this game to me really kind of harkens back to those games.

30:52.160 --> 30:56.840
Certainly the narrator adds a lot of ambience to it and, you know, just makes the storytelling,

30:56.840 --> 31:02.040
I guess it makes it less just pictures on a screen.

31:02.040 --> 31:06.800
And it really does add to the ambience of the game and the story that you're trying

31:06.800 --> 31:07.800
to get immersed in.

31:07.800 --> 31:11.440
But if you were to take it out, I would still be interested in this game.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.440
Yeah.

31:12.440 --> 31:16.280
I don't think it's the sole motivator, but it just makes a good thing better.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.760
If that makes sense.

31:17.760 --> 31:21.480
If only they had that narrator in Saints Row the Third.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.480
You never know.

31:22.480 --> 31:28.120
And then he decided to stand there and flip off the prostitute.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.640
Derek H. in the chat says, From Dust is great.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.680
And yeah, I'll admit, I probably didn't give it a fair chance.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.600
You know, it was late last night and I just kind of got fed up and I was like, I'm just

31:36.600 --> 31:37.600
gonna go back to Street Fighter.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.600
Fuck this.

31:38.600 --> 31:43.080
So I'm going to approach it again a little later on because I refuse to believe that

31:43.080 --> 31:46.720
I wouldn't really get more out of this game considering I really used to like the Sim

31:46.720 --> 31:50.240
City, the Populous, and those types of games back in the day.

31:50.240 --> 31:54.580
And I keep saying Populous because that's the one I am really reminded of.

31:54.580 --> 31:58.240
This really does feel like just an all new version of that game.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.680
So all right, moving on.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.260
That's pretty much it for our gaming weeks.

32:03.260 --> 32:07.700
So let's move on to some housekeeping tonight of which we don't have a whole lot.

32:07.700 --> 32:10.480
We still have every show planned for the month.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.580
I don't think we have any shows planned off.

32:12.580 --> 32:15.540
There might be one at the end of August because I'm going to be gone at the end of August,

32:15.540 --> 32:17.080
but that's that's a ways off.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.720
You are not going on any trips after all.

32:19.720 --> 32:24.560
So we'll be having shows for the foreseeable future for at least the next four weeks.

32:24.560 --> 32:25.760
Oh, nonsense.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.400
That's why that's why you have MMOs.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.880
You're never lonely.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.200
You will not be forever alone.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.540
All right.

32:33.540 --> 32:36.880
If you know what, if you're feeling forever alone, Dark Soccer, you should just hop into

32:36.880 --> 32:40.200
our chat room during the week and say, I can has hug and there's there's people in there

32:40.200 --> 32:41.200
throughout the week.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.200
They'll just say hugs.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.200
There you go.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.200
OK.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.840
I challenge you to do that twice this week.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.200
OK, we'll see.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.800
All right.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.320
Otherwise, visit our Web site, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

32:53.320 --> 32:56.840
Of course, you can always visit us on Twitter, Twitter dot com slash O.L.R..

32:56.840 --> 32:59.960
If you have comments on the show as it's going tonight and you're not in the chat, you can

32:59.960 --> 33:03.280
always send us a tweet and we'll get to some of your tweets later on in the program.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.040
So Twitter dot com slash O.L.R. for that.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.800
Of course, we are on Facebook as well.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.800
Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.040
We're on Tumblr now.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.280
I don't think we've been posting a lot there, but it's there.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.800
Orange Lounge Radio dot Tumblr dot com.

33:14.800 --> 33:15.800
Right.

33:15.800 --> 33:16.800
Is that right?

33:16.800 --> 33:17.800
Orange Lounge Radio?

33:17.800 --> 33:18.800
Yes.

33:18.800 --> 33:19.800
It's new.

33:19.800 --> 33:20.800
I don't know.

33:20.800 --> 33:21.800
I don't know all the stuff now.

33:21.800 --> 33:22.800
And it's new.

33:22.800 --> 33:23.800
There you go.

33:23.800 --> 33:24.800
Do we finally delete the Myspace?

33:24.800 --> 33:25.800
We might have.

33:25.800 --> 33:29.320
I think that's maybe the Myspace is just might be just an archive of old, old, old ass clips

33:29.320 --> 33:33.600
in the to go edition, because that's how long it's been there, you know, like some treasure

33:33.600 --> 33:34.600
fossil.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.600
There you go.

33:35.600 --> 33:36.600
There you go.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.740
It's like a it'll be like something you discover like in from dust, like doing archaeology

33:39.740 --> 33:40.740
and wow.

33:40.740 --> 33:41.740
All right.

33:41.740 --> 33:44.040
Anyhow, let's move on to some gaming news.

33:44.040 --> 33:51.160
And I obviously the blogosphere has been blowing up this week with chat on a few topics.

33:51.160 --> 33:55.000
And I know you're all dying to know what Loki thinks of some of this stuff.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.360
I'm dying to know what you guys think of some of this stuff in our chat room.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.360
Let's get to it.

33:59.360 --> 34:02.160
Loki, we please do the honors of starting us off with the big news this week.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.160
All right.

34:03.160 --> 34:07.560
So Nintendo hasn't been doing that great with the 3DS.

34:07.560 --> 34:13.720
They cut their profits forecast by 82 percent, basically dropping their estimated profit

34:13.720 --> 34:21.080
from 20 billion yen or about two hundred and fifty seven million dollars to one hundred

34:21.080 --> 34:27.680
and ten billion yen or about one point for one billion, I guess.

34:27.680 --> 34:31.360
Or I'm sorry, I got that all backwards.

34:31.360 --> 34:38.600
They dropped it down to two or 20 billion yen from 110 billion yen, which is quite a

34:38.600 --> 34:39.600
drop.

34:39.600 --> 34:45.400
And of course, you know, basing it on the fact that, you know, they they're saying that

34:45.400 --> 34:53.680
the stronger than expected yen appreciation and sales performance of the 3DS hardware

34:53.680 --> 34:58.200
and sales outlook for the holiday season.

34:58.200 --> 35:04.400
They're going to be dropping the price, of course, of the 3DS on August 12th to one hundred

35:04.400 --> 35:09.960
and seventy dollars from its two hundred and fifty dollar mark right now.

35:09.960 --> 35:15.080
And I guess something similar is going to happen effective August 11th in Japan, dropping

35:15.080 --> 35:21.740
the system from twenty five thousand yen to fifteen thousand yen.

35:21.740 --> 35:26.560
And of course, there's no price yet in Europe, but I'm sure they're going to get some sort

35:26.560 --> 35:29.760
of drop.

35:29.760 --> 35:33.640
And then, of course, if you're having a little bit of buyers remorse because you bought a

35:33.640 --> 35:38.360
launch system and you're like, what the fuck, you know, eighty dollars now, what am I going

35:38.360 --> 35:39.360
to do?

35:39.360 --> 35:42.660
Well, Nintendo is actually going to give you some free games.

35:42.660 --> 35:49.960
And they said basically anybody that signs into Nintendo's eShop before August 12th will

35:49.960 --> 35:55.500
be signed up automatically to the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador program.

35:55.500 --> 36:03.480
And basically you get ten free NES virtual console games on September 1st.

36:03.480 --> 36:09.660
And I guess it's before the release of the games for everybody else and also some Game

36:09.660 --> 36:10.920
Boy Advance games.

36:10.920 --> 36:14.540
Also that's kind of their way of saying, hey, we're going to have an NES virtual console

36:14.540 --> 36:19.820
system on the 3DS and also going to offer Game Boy Advance games since this has never

36:19.820 --> 36:21.880
been mentioned prior to this.

36:21.880 --> 36:26.800
And, you know, some of the games that they're giving away, I mean, they're not half bad

36:26.800 --> 36:27.800
actually.

36:27.800 --> 36:31.060
It's, you know, like The Legend of Zelda, Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, of course they're

36:31.060 --> 36:35.960
seeing some Game Boy Advance games, Yoshi's Island, Super Mario Advance 3, Mario Kart,

36:35.960 --> 36:45.520
Metroid Fusion, WarioWare, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, so, you know, quite a few things.

36:45.520 --> 36:51.240
And also, I guess, let's stop there before we get to some of the other stuff because

36:51.240 --> 36:53.620
I want to dissect this a little bit because I've got to admit, when did this all come

36:53.620 --> 36:54.620
down?

36:54.620 --> 36:56.960
Like it was probably Wednesday or so when this was all announced.

36:56.960 --> 37:02.480
And I've got to admit, I was reading, you know, the updates through Twitter and so forth

37:02.480 --> 37:07.760
and through my Google Reader and I was like, what the hell is going on today?

37:07.760 --> 37:10.160
I feel like I've stepped into Bizarro World.

37:10.160 --> 37:12.100
What happened at Nintendo?

37:12.100 --> 37:17.180
Like something huge went down there because this is just, does this even feel like the

37:17.180 --> 37:19.480
same Nintendo from just a couple months ago?

37:19.480 --> 37:21.440
It's the screams of desperation.

37:21.440 --> 37:28.240
I mean, and when I told Salacious Pop about it, and I think he put it best, he said, wow,

37:28.240 --> 37:31.800
Nintendo just totally ate shit.

37:31.800 --> 37:40.040
And they really did, like, what, I mean, clearly the 3DS not performing up to expectations

37:40.040 --> 37:45.000
and there's been a lot of flack on that, but I honestly didn't see this coming.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.560
I mean, there's so much about this that's just out of character.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.560
A, they didn't announce a price drop today.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.760
They announced a price drop a few weeks from now.

37:53.760 --> 37:57.920
And that's usually not what you want to do because that's kind of suicide to your sales

37:57.920 --> 37:58.920
right away.

37:58.920 --> 38:06.620
But then B, they turn around and announce this program with 20 free games, 20 Nintendo,

38:06.620 --> 38:12.440
that is not, Nintuantido, that is not something I would have ever expected out of Nintendo.

38:12.440 --> 38:16.280
But it gives people incentive to buy the game, the system at full price to get the freebies.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.280
It does.

38:17.280 --> 38:21.000
I don't get that perspective of it, but I still don't get it, like, I still don't get

38:21.000 --> 38:24.280
it being Nintendo because I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:24.280 --> 38:28.240
Like I would have expected Nintendo to be like, oh, well, you know, well, we're going

38:28.240 --> 38:33.600
to cut the price and, you know, we're going to give you some free club Nintendo points

38:33.600 --> 38:38.520
or we're going to let you have Mario Brothers 2 early or something.

38:38.520 --> 38:42.240
I was not expecting 20 games.

38:42.240 --> 38:47.640
That is a huge, like, in my opinion is a huge admission of something on Nintendo.

38:47.640 --> 38:48.680
Like we didn't just fuck up.

38:48.680 --> 38:51.160
We fucked up big.

38:51.160 --> 38:56.160
That's what's surprising about it to me is that to be honest, to be fair, I realize that

38:56.160 --> 39:00.300
if I buy something early, like a 3DS, it's very likely to get a price cut in the future.

39:00.300 --> 39:04.440
If they had announced a price drop and they said, oh, you only get a Mario game, I would

39:04.440 --> 39:08.560
have been like, okay, well, you know, that's the price you pay for getting shit early.

39:08.560 --> 39:13.080
Loki imported a 3DS and paid a premium to have it like a couple weeks early.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.420
That's just what we do sometimes because we're sick.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.320
We want to have the newest gadgets early.

39:17.320 --> 39:21.280
I would have been perfectly fine with it, but now to hear there's like 20 free games

39:21.280 --> 39:22.280
coming out.

39:22.280 --> 39:26.960
Now I'm not just like, oh, I'm not unhappy about this price drop.

39:26.960 --> 39:31.320
Now I'm like, fuck, I'm really glad I bought one early.

39:31.320 --> 39:35.840
I mean, look at the games they're talking about on the Game Boy Advance, Metroid, Yoshi's

39:35.840 --> 39:36.840
Island.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.000
Metroid Fusion's fucking awesome.

39:39.000 --> 39:44.520
They're not, there might be like half and half, half crap, half, but no, half triple

39:44.520 --> 39:45.520
A titles.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.080
I do have a point though to make.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.080
What?

39:48.080 --> 39:51.880
We're glad that we didn't get one because first of all, all of those games that are

39:51.880 --> 39:54.520
worth having, I already own.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.520
I bought them on my old system.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.960
Second, we're not going to spend as much money.

39:59.960 --> 40:00.960
Okay.

40:00.960 --> 40:04.840
But hold that thought because Loki, you got to read this next bit then on this.

40:04.840 --> 40:07.520
I know you're dying to give your impressions to, Loki, but I'm going to make the listeners

40:07.520 --> 40:08.520
wait a minute.

40:08.520 --> 40:12.720
So Loki, read this next story because here's, here's where things get real fucking interesting

40:12.720 --> 40:13.720
real quick.

40:13.720 --> 40:18.040
Uh, 3DS NES games will also include multiplayer following an update.

40:18.040 --> 40:25.000
Yes, you'll be able to play those, um, virtual console games, um, I guess with other people

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
now.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.200
I'm not sure if that's over the internet or if that's just locally, but that's kind

40:29.200 --> 40:30.200
of interesting.

40:30.200 --> 40:33.800
Um, and here's the list of NES games that they've announced.

40:33.800 --> 40:38.880
Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong Jr, Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, and The Legend of Zelda,

40:38.880 --> 40:43.320
and then of course five other unknown games right now.

40:43.320 --> 40:50.120
So, they added multiplayer into virtual console and we don't know yet, but this possibly could

40:50.120 --> 40:53.200
be over the internet.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.320
They're doing what they should have done with the Wii five years ago?

40:56.320 --> 40:57.320
Finally?

40:57.320 --> 41:03.500
I mean, that makes these games a lot more, I mean, because let's face it, Nintendo is

41:03.500 --> 41:05.280
kind of sucker punching us a little bit here.

41:05.280 --> 41:09.640
If you didn't early adopt the 3DS and you do want to get these games and let's say they

41:09.640 --> 41:13.000
do end up being multiplayer over the internet, you're going to have to buy them again.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.080
Even if you bought them for five bucks the first time on the Wii, you're going to have

41:15.080 --> 41:16.580
to buy them again.

41:16.580 --> 41:20.560
But for the early adopters, now you're kind of in this, well, I can't really get mad cause

41:20.560 --> 41:22.040
I'm still going to get it for free.

41:22.040 --> 41:25.080
But Dark Sakura, let's say the multiplayer thing pans out.

41:25.080 --> 41:27.720
Let's say it ends up that you can play it on the internet.

41:27.720 --> 41:31.000
Now does that change your opinion or are you still like, no, at the end of the day I say

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
I'm saving 80 bucks.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.060
I don't care about multiplayer.

41:34.060 --> 41:35.640
I really don't.

41:35.640 --> 41:37.640
So that's just, okay, good.

41:37.640 --> 41:40.960
I'm glad for other people, but I don't care.

41:40.960 --> 41:41.960
That's me.

41:41.960 --> 41:42.960
Fair enough.

41:42.960 --> 41:43.960
Fair enough.

41:43.960 --> 41:49.960
Keep in mind how few times I've done any multiplayer game on Xbox live or I think the last multiplayer

41:49.960 --> 41:57.400
game I've played that involved a Nintendo system was playing Super Mario Brothers.

41:57.400 --> 42:00.760
And then that I didn't really like it with the multiplayer aspect.

42:00.760 --> 42:03.200
So cause I was just like, stop being stupid.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.200
Just let me play by myself.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.880
You know, I was just getting annoyed.

42:06.880 --> 42:11.140
So I do not play well with others.

42:11.140 --> 42:16.680
Now I want to emphasize, we don't know for sure yet if multiplayer means multiplayer

42:16.680 --> 42:18.200
on the internet.

42:18.200 --> 42:22.080
We're all forming a prayer circle right now that for those of us that are in a multiplayer,

42:22.080 --> 42:24.780
we're all forming a prayer circle that Nintendo is going to do the right thing and they are

42:24.780 --> 42:28.440
going to open up the internet because if the emulation scene's been able to do it for years,

42:28.440 --> 42:31.160
there's no reason Nintendo cannot open these games to play on the internet.

42:31.160 --> 42:36.200
However, we should only expect that multiplayer means within the same room, which is still

42:36.200 --> 42:41.160
interesting, I guess.

42:41.160 --> 42:45.880
I don't know if I would repay $5 for these games for that alone, but if Nintendo is going

42:45.880 --> 42:49.280
to hand them to me for free, I'm not exactly going to bash them.

42:49.280 --> 42:51.280
You know what I mean?

42:51.280 --> 42:53.040
And then here's another interesting thing.

42:53.040 --> 43:02.560
Apparently, Satori Iwata, he's gone ahead and taken a 50% reduction in pay as a result

43:02.560 --> 43:04.920
of the 3DS's slow sales.

43:04.920 --> 43:05.920
What?

43:05.920 --> 43:07.320
Who are you people?

43:07.320 --> 43:09.920
Nintendo, I don't even know you anymore.

43:09.920 --> 43:13.640
You're taking pay cuts now?

43:13.640 --> 43:22.600
Other representative directors, including senior managing directors Miyamoto and Shinji

43:22.600 --> 43:30.520
Hatano, are taking a 30% pay cut and other executives will lose 20% off their salaries.

43:30.520 --> 43:34.200
I bet you anything that will not happen to Nintendo US.

43:34.200 --> 43:37.320
I think they said Reggie's one of the affected people, right?

43:37.320 --> 43:38.320
Uh, no.

43:38.320 --> 43:39.320
Oh, interesting.

43:39.320 --> 43:41.120
I didn't pick up on that.

43:41.120 --> 43:43.800
Doing something like that is, honestly, it's...

43:43.800 --> 43:47.380
It is the corporate equivalent of falling on your sword.

43:47.380 --> 43:49.000
It's very much a Japanese thing.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.140
Oh yeah.

43:50.140 --> 43:55.880
To take responsibility, you know, for the sake of the whole company.

43:55.880 --> 43:57.320
If only Congress would do that.

43:57.320 --> 43:58.320
I know, right?

43:58.320 --> 43:59.320
But I mean...

43:59.320 --> 44:05.360
So now, in the scope of a week, we've gone from kicking Nintendo, fuck you Nintendo,

44:05.360 --> 44:09.920
Operation Rainfall for life, fuck you, I hate you, to, oh my god, Congress needs to look

44:09.920 --> 44:12.800
at what Nintendo's doing.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.440
This all happened in a week!

44:14.440 --> 44:15.680
I know.

44:15.680 --> 44:20.400
Honestly, every politician needs to take a look at what Nintendo's doing.

44:20.400 --> 44:23.240
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

44:23.240 --> 44:30.200
Before we start talking about what Congress needs to start emulating from Nintendo, we're

44:30.200 --> 44:36.040
still not over the fact that they botched all this stuff up with the Wii and all the

44:36.040 --> 44:39.240
online and not bringing games over and whatnot.

44:39.240 --> 44:40.880
But this is a very effective diversion.

44:40.880 --> 44:42.920
Let me put it this way, okay?

44:42.920 --> 44:52.480
Sony, they made a multi-million dollar error, if you will, in their online security, and

44:52.480 --> 44:54.720
I got two games for it.

44:54.720 --> 44:58.760
Nintendo, to make up for dropping- You got four games, you know you work the system,

44:58.760 --> 45:02.480
just like the rest of us did with the multi-accounts.

45:02.480 --> 45:05.800
To be fair, you got two PS3 games, two PSP games-

45:05.800 --> 45:11.840
I did not actually do it on my other- Alright, well, whatever, it doesn't matter.

45:11.840 --> 45:17.120
Um, and then, you know, we get- Okay, four games, fine.

45:17.120 --> 45:20.560
Whereas Nintendo, oh, we're making up for dropping the console price.

45:20.560 --> 45:24.620
Something that, you know, we knew was gonna happen, granted, it's a little bit earlier

45:24.620 --> 45:25.620
than expected.

45:25.620 --> 45:26.620
Who cares?

45:26.620 --> 45:29.120
You know, if you've already bought it, whatever.

45:29.120 --> 45:34.400
Um, so, you know, they're gonna give me twenty dollars, or twenty free games.

45:34.400 --> 45:38.660
Now here's the best part, if you really want to game the system, here's what you do.

45:38.660 --> 45:45.520
You go to, you know, a Best Buy, or a Walmart, or something like that, just before August

45:45.520 --> 45:46.520
12th.

45:46.520 --> 45:51.440
You buy a system for the full price, you log it onto Nintendo's network, and then when

45:51.440 --> 45:55.480
it drops the price two days later, you come in and go, what the hell?

45:55.480 --> 45:56.560
Why this drop in price?

45:56.560 --> 45:58.480
I want a, you know, refund.

45:58.480 --> 46:01.260
And they will refund you the difference in price.

46:01.260 --> 46:05.240
If these companies are smart, which I'm not saying they are, but if they're smart, they're

46:05.240 --> 46:09.920
gonna put an exemption to their policy, like just a couple weeks before.

46:09.920 --> 46:10.920
Watch.

46:10.920 --> 46:12.800
At least one of these stores is gonna do that.

46:12.800 --> 46:16.680
They're gonna say, 3DS accepted from the policy from X to Y day.

46:16.680 --> 46:20.760
They're gonna wait till right that first day that the refund, you know, if it's like a

46:20.760 --> 46:24.320
twenty one day window, they'll wait till, well I guess we would be in that window, but,

46:24.320 --> 46:27.320
you know, I don't know what the windows are, depending on what store you shop at, but I

46:27.320 --> 46:29.960
bet some of them are gonna throw up an exception.

46:29.960 --> 46:34.680
Maybe not something as huge as Walmart, but I bet you some of these other stores will.

46:34.680 --> 46:39.160
You'll probably get, well at the very least, you know, if those games are interesting to

46:39.160 --> 46:41.200
you, I mean, you can give it a shot.

46:41.200 --> 46:46.160
I mean, I think that most of the time, if you're gonna, you know, you just play ignorant,

46:46.160 --> 46:51.000
I guess, and, you know, cause not everybody's up reading gaming news and stuff like that.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.040
You know, the moms and stuff like that, they aren't reading that, but then they hear about

46:54.040 --> 46:55.800
an eighty dollar price drop, and they're like, what the hell?

46:55.800 --> 46:57.440
I just spent the money.

46:57.440 --> 47:00.000
Of course, you know.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.320
Of course, we know that, but.

47:03.320 --> 47:08.880
So Loki, you, okay, Loki, sometimes your thoughts on Nintendo really confuse the hell out of

47:08.880 --> 47:15.600
me because you imported a 3DS from Japan just so you could have it before anybody else,

47:15.600 --> 47:20.200
and you know, you were an early adopter of Nintendo, and I know you were an early adopter

47:20.200 --> 47:23.440
of Wii as well, but then Nintendo does things that really piss you off, and you've screamed

47:23.440 --> 47:28.000
and you've yelled at them here on the show, so surely you must have seen the news this

47:28.000 --> 47:29.720
week and gone, what is this?

47:29.720 --> 47:30.720
What is going on?

47:30.720 --> 47:33.440
What is your reaction to all the news this week, and where are you at now?

47:33.440 --> 47:36.080
My reaction is like, wow, I'm surprised they're dropping it this early.

47:36.080 --> 47:40.680
I'm like, I guess that's an admission that, you know, it's not selling well, which we

47:40.680 --> 47:44.760
all knew, and then, you know, wasn't angry about it.

47:44.760 --> 47:48.680
You know, the only thing about these twenty free games is that, you know, it's kind of

47:48.680 --> 47:49.680
cool.

47:49.680 --> 47:52.480
At least I'll have something that I can put on my memory card that I can play, cause I'm

47:52.480 --> 47:56.360
not, I'm not fucking buying any of those virtual console games.

47:56.360 --> 48:00.500
I'm not paying money for that kind of stuff, hell no.

48:00.500 --> 48:04.720
So that's kind of cool that I'll have something to fill up my memory card with, but at the

48:04.720 --> 48:09.000
same time, you know, dropping the price of the system doesn't make any of the good games

48:09.000 --> 48:15.200
come out any sooner, I mean, cause, you know, what, they announced a couple games, you know,

48:15.200 --> 48:21.520
out this year, a new Mario, a Mario Kart, and stuff like that, but, I mean, I've seen

48:21.520 --> 48:25.880
the videos of Mario Kart, and I was just kind of, eh, they added hang gliders and underwater,

48:25.880 --> 48:27.560
big fucking deal.

48:27.560 --> 48:33.280
You know, it's not that exciting, so, you know, I, it, I'll have something to download

48:33.280 --> 48:37.040
for free, but it's not gonna definitely, not gonna get me to buy more things, and it's

48:37.040 --> 48:40.680
definitely not gonna get me to buy crappy games that are out there now.

48:40.680 --> 48:46.640
So, I mean, I would just have, I'm glad I'll have it used to dust off my system, cause

48:46.640 --> 48:50.240
I was looking at it as sitting on the coffee table, not being charged or anything, just

48:50.240 --> 48:53.360
sitting there, I'm like, eh, well, I don't know.

48:53.360 --> 48:58.280
Uh, go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrady.com, technist in our chatroom says, right, Nintendo

48:58.280 --> 49:02.640
running America, that means they will just rehash the same laws and not make new ones.

49:02.640 --> 49:06.600
Isn't that kind of what's happening now, like, nobody wants to do something different, that's,

49:06.600 --> 49:10.240
that's where we're at right now, but anyway, sorry, didn't mean to, uh, get controversial.

49:10.240 --> 49:14.560
So this is Pop in our chat, says, what I want to know is, will DSi XL get a price drop too

49:14.560 --> 49:15.560
now?

49:15.560 --> 49:20.320
Very interesting that that is completely absent, but I would think logically it has to, right,

49:20.320 --> 49:23.560
cause isn't the DSi XL right now, $179?

49:23.560 --> 49:24.560
I don't remember.

49:24.560 --> 49:27.880
I thought they already dropped the price of that stuff, I know they did the regular DS.

49:27.880 --> 49:33.940
But even, I mean, logically, if the 3DS is coming down that low, XL and the rest of them,

49:33.940 --> 49:38.000
if they're not fading into obscurity altogether, are going to have to get some type of price

49:38.000 --> 49:44.640
cut, like XL ought to come down to 129, if not less, but I don't know, there's also a

49:44.640 --> 49:47.720
part of me that kind of thinks like, well, why wouldn't Nintendo just get rid of all

49:47.720 --> 49:52.760
the old DSs altogether and say, buy a 3DS or get GTFO?

49:52.760 --> 49:55.040
I mean, and could you really blame them for doing that?

49:55.040 --> 50:00.040
I mean, you would still have the current inventory on shelves now, we'll get their prices slashed

50:00.040 --> 50:05.220
to get it off the shelves and make room for more 3DSs, but, well, let's talk about the

50:05.220 --> 50:11.160
other topic that kind of comes up with this story and that is how does the Vita play into

50:11.160 --> 50:12.160
all of this?

50:12.160 --> 50:16.480
Because obviously a lot of folks, when they heard that the price point of the Vita was

50:16.480 --> 50:22.080
going to be $250 for the lowest model was like, uh oh, Nintendo's in trouble.

50:22.080 --> 50:27.600
So a lot of people see what's going on right now as a direct response, not just to Nintendo's

50:27.600 --> 50:32.120
not doing so hot right now with the 3DS, but the Vita is going to be the same price and

50:32.120 --> 50:34.160
Nintendo foresees trouble if they don't do this now.

50:34.160 --> 50:37.760
I think it's a good idea that they did it because of the Vita and also because right

50:37.760 --> 50:42.720
now the Vita's launch lineup is looking about as good as Nintendo's 3DS launch lineup.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.640
Thank you, that's where I'm coming from.

50:44.640 --> 50:48.400
There's these, you know, and I'm reading things on the internet that are like, oh, Sony was

50:48.400 --> 50:52.000
just, Sony was ready to give Nintendo rumble and stuff, and like, I'm not trying to hate

50:52.000 --> 50:55.960
on the Vita, but I also don't see where it's in much better of a position right now.

50:55.960 --> 51:00.240
All the announced titles that they've got coming out right now aren't that exciting.

51:00.240 --> 51:01.240
Uncharted.

51:01.240 --> 51:03.960
That's their one big, huge thing they got.

51:03.960 --> 51:09.480
Yeah, the other ones, like, I couldn't give a crap about whatever the hell that game,

51:09.480 --> 51:14.080
the puzzle game is where they're like really showing off the back touch stuff or, you know,

51:14.080 --> 51:21.200
I don't need another fucking rehash of goddamn, you know, uh, was it, uh, well, Little Big

51:21.200 --> 51:22.200
Planet for one.

51:22.200 --> 51:27.840
I mean, yeah, great, you know, Little Big Planet's coming out, but it's just like, okay,

51:27.840 --> 51:30.840
it's gonna do a few different things.

51:30.840 --> 51:32.280
I just don't care.

51:32.280 --> 51:36.560
Or their kart racing game, which for the life of me I can't remember the fuck it's called

51:36.560 --> 51:38.680
right now, but I don't care.

51:38.680 --> 51:42.640
Ooh, I can make mountains by putting my fingers in their, I don't care.

51:42.640 --> 51:44.440
I just don't care.

51:44.440 --> 51:50.280
So I don't know, it's, I just think, you know, and don't get me wrong.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.280
I want a Vita.

51:51.280 --> 51:52.680
I'm going to buy a Vita at launch.

51:52.680 --> 51:53.680
I will.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.800
I mean, I just, I, I'm a techno, techno person.

51:55.800 --> 52:00.120
I have to have it all, but, uh, and there, there are a couple of games on Vita.

52:00.120 --> 52:04.720
I do want, there was that one music game that Miklotov was talking about on one of the E3

52:04.720 --> 52:05.720
specials that I want to get.

52:05.720 --> 52:08.600
And then there's that dungeon game that there, that probably won't be out at launch, but

52:08.600 --> 52:10.520
I know down the road, I'll want to get that.

52:10.520 --> 52:15.120
Um, so there are things on Vita that I want, but I look at the holidays and I go, I still

52:15.120 --> 52:16.640
think Nintendo is going to win.

52:16.640 --> 52:18.520
I don't think the Vita is going to win the holidays.

52:18.520 --> 52:19.920
I got Mario.

52:19.920 --> 52:23.100
I know 3DS has the Mario games coming out.

52:23.100 --> 52:26.360
Do not underestimate the power of the soccer mom.

52:26.360 --> 52:28.380
What won Christmas five years ago?

52:28.380 --> 52:29.400
The Wii.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.080
What won Christmas last year?

52:31.080 --> 52:32.080
The Kinect.

52:32.080 --> 52:34.200
Who is the target audience of both of those?

52:34.200 --> 52:35.580
Oprah watchers.

52:35.580 --> 52:38.920
You know, it's, I think it's going to be the same story this year.

52:38.920 --> 52:43.960
The performance from March to now isn't really going to matter when it comes to the holidays

52:43.960 --> 52:49.640
and all the kids everywhere want the 3DS to play Mario and watch 3D movies on.

52:49.640 --> 52:52.320
I mean, the 3DS kind of has a lot going for it.

52:52.320 --> 52:56.320
And I got to think also that some people, well, a lot of people probably thought, Hey,

52:56.320 --> 52:57.320
you know what?

52:57.320 --> 53:02.480
Nintendo is probably going to drop the price of the 3DS before holiday because you know,

53:02.480 --> 53:04.280
it's not doing that well.

53:04.280 --> 53:08.440
Or I mean, even if it was doing all right, they still want to, you know, incentivize

53:08.440 --> 53:11.000
people for, you know, buying the system.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.680
I mean, I think a lot of people are like, well, you know what?

53:12.680 --> 53:14.280
There's not a lot of good games out right now.

53:14.280 --> 53:16.000
I'm just going to wait.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
And waiting paid off for you.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.320
I'm just saying, imagine you're a soccer mom.

53:21.320 --> 53:23.440
Now, I know, I know.

53:23.440 --> 53:24.440
Just hear me out here for a minute.

53:24.440 --> 53:28.760
Imagine you're a soccer mom and you don't know anything about games, but you know, there's

53:28.760 --> 53:33.760
this one system that's $250 that I guess does some type of back touch thing.

53:33.760 --> 53:40.400
But then there's this other system over here that's $80 less and it does 3D Mario and it

53:40.400 --> 53:41.400
has Mario on it.

53:41.400 --> 53:42.400
Yeah.

53:42.400 --> 53:46.760
Would you remember some of your friends liking when you were in junior high school?

53:46.760 --> 53:48.720
Which is where the soccer moms are at now.

53:48.720 --> 53:49.720
Right?

53:49.720 --> 53:50.720
Yeah.

53:50.720 --> 53:54.000
So I mean, like, when I'm not trying to, again, I'm not trying to knock the Vita.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.360
I think it's going to be huge with the college crowd and the young twenties and you know,

53:58.360 --> 54:01.320
more adult gamers, if you will, it'll still be huge with them.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.960
And the fact that it's a, you know, all in one in the pocket.

54:03.960 --> 54:07.960
But I think when it comes down to the actual sales, I think what shows up under those Christmas

54:07.960 --> 54:13.480
trees and Hanukkah menorahs and so forth are going to be 3DSs.

54:13.480 --> 54:15.440
Do you put your presence under the menorah?

54:15.440 --> 54:16.800
We don't really do presence for Hanukkah.

54:16.800 --> 54:21.000
I thought you were supposed to have eight crazy nights.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.720
The whole presence thing started because of Christmas actually.

54:24.720 --> 54:28.640
Cause little kids that my friends, my Gentile friends get presents.

54:28.640 --> 54:30.840
I want presents too.

54:30.840 --> 54:33.200
Usually it's like the back to school holiday.

54:33.200 --> 54:34.600
You get pencils and paper.

54:34.600 --> 54:36.520
So I don't have to get you a present heathen.

54:36.520 --> 54:37.520
You can get me a present.

54:37.520 --> 54:40.840
I get you a present.

54:40.840 --> 54:44.160
I get you guys presents because I know that you celebrate Christmas.

54:44.160 --> 54:47.980
Well, you know, I like presents because I'm greedy.

54:47.980 --> 54:48.980
There you go.

54:48.980 --> 54:49.980
And special.

54:49.980 --> 54:50.980
There you go.

54:50.980 --> 54:55.920
Uh, going to our chat room, uh, laha in the chat room says, I think the parents didn't

54:55.920 --> 54:57.280
like the 3D.

54:57.280 --> 55:00.000
Something about not wanting to mess up their kids' eyes.

55:00.000 --> 55:05.440
Uh, but what about, okay, look at movies, dude, Smurfs 3D is like a top as a box office.

55:05.440 --> 55:07.280
3D really bugs my eyes.

55:07.280 --> 55:09.880
You know, I hate looking at the world in 3D.

55:09.880 --> 55:12.080
It really hurts my eyes.

55:12.080 --> 55:13.080
Actually I will tell you something.

55:13.080 --> 55:14.920
I know what laha is referring to.

55:14.920 --> 55:20.200
It's those studies about the kids' eyes and so forth, but honestly the 3DS itself is not

55:20.200 --> 55:21.200
true 3D.

55:21.200 --> 55:25.680
It's lenticular and that can cause some issues with, with vision.

55:25.680 --> 55:27.280
I mean, it gives me a headache.

55:27.280 --> 55:30.680
I can't play a 3DS for very long without getting a headache.

55:30.680 --> 55:35.400
So the first day it gave me a headache, but now it's fine.

55:35.400 --> 55:37.520
Ridge Racer was unplayable.

55:37.520 --> 55:38.660
It was just completely unplayable.

55:38.660 --> 55:41.800
I've actually been using the 3DS a little bit as a Netflix device.

55:41.800 --> 55:44.800
Like it's kind of nice to just have it like, you know, when you're like lying in bed, but

55:44.800 --> 55:46.260
you're not really ready to go to sleep.

55:46.260 --> 55:50.000
Like it's kind of nice to just be able to, you know, have the thing there to watch Netflix.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
Yeah.

55:51.000 --> 55:55.400
And funny enough, I have an iPhone, which I could use, but I don't know, usually that's

55:55.400 --> 55:56.400
on the charger.

55:56.400 --> 55:58.280
But the 3DS just kind of works.

55:58.280 --> 55:59.280
Yeah.

55:59.280 --> 56:01.720
You know, I guess they do have a point with the 3D thing.

56:01.720 --> 56:04.360
I mean, that's really gonna torpedo their sales.

56:04.360 --> 56:08.960
If only they had the forethought to, you know, put in a slider or something to turn the 3D

56:08.960 --> 56:09.960
off.

56:09.960 --> 56:10.960
If only.

56:10.960 --> 56:14.200
Sorry Nintendo, maybe next time.

56:14.200 --> 56:16.320
All right.

56:16.320 --> 56:20.680
And Tigerclaw and Chad is correcting me saying Smurfs and Cowboy and Aliens are sharing the

56:20.680 --> 56:22.600
number one spot this week.

56:22.600 --> 56:27.040
But the reason why the Smurfs is even tied in the first place is that it's, it's has

56:27.040 --> 56:31.560
those extra 3D ticket sales because let's face it, no one over the age of 11 wanted

56:31.560 --> 56:33.080
to see the Smurfs movie.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.020
I still want to see Cowboys and Aliens.

56:35.020 --> 56:40.520
I'm very torn about the Smurfs movie because I really like Neil Patrick Harris, but I really

56:40.520 --> 56:42.520
hate everything else about that movie.

56:42.520 --> 56:48.360
I love Hank Azaria and he's Gargamel, but I am not fucking sitting through that movie.

56:48.360 --> 56:49.360
I'm sorry.

56:49.360 --> 56:51.620
He does, however, look just like freaking Gargamel, doesn't he?

56:51.620 --> 56:52.620
I will give you that.

56:52.620 --> 56:54.560
Why are we talking about the Smurfs movie?

56:54.560 --> 56:57.800
Because we're talking about sales and 3D and shit.

56:57.800 --> 56:58.800
But you know what though?

56:58.800 --> 57:03.160
The Muppets movie, there's a lot of the cast from, uh, you know, How I Met Your Mother.

57:03.160 --> 57:04.160
Fuck yes to the Muppets movie.

57:04.160 --> 57:06.640
And I can't wait.

57:06.640 --> 57:07.640
That's going to be me.

57:07.640 --> 57:08.880
A hundred percent yes to the Muppets movie.

57:08.880 --> 57:11.280
A hundred percent no to the Smurfs movie.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.280
Smurfs is terrible.

57:12.280 --> 57:13.280
All right.

57:13.280 --> 57:14.280
You know what else is terrible?

57:14.280 --> 57:15.280
What?

57:15.280 --> 57:16.280
Since we're on this tangent train.

57:16.280 --> 57:17.280
Okay.

57:17.280 --> 57:18.280
Battleship.

57:18.280 --> 57:19.280
What the fuck is that?

57:19.280 --> 57:20.280
Oh my God.

57:20.280 --> 57:22.280
Oh my God.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.400
That movie looks a special kind of terrible.

57:24.400 --> 57:28.520
I saw that you posted the trailer on the Facebook and I think my comment was quote, this looks

57:28.520 --> 57:29.520
like shit.

57:29.520 --> 57:32.480
No, Dan showed it to me and my reply was what?

57:32.480 --> 57:34.360
I'm like, I'm sorry.

57:34.360 --> 57:38.860
Last time I played Battleship, I didn't, I mean, and the way the trailer looked like

57:38.860 --> 57:43.240
with the configuration of the ships, I was literally expecting Leah Neeson to shout out

57:43.240 --> 57:49.640
I seven and Rhianna to go, girl, you shot my battleship.

57:49.640 --> 57:50.760
That's what they're setting up.

57:50.760 --> 57:53.520
It's just like, well, our radar's out.

57:53.520 --> 57:58.200
We have this satellite imagery that we're going to use to plot where we fire stuff and

57:58.200 --> 58:03.320
the enemies, you know, the whatever their missiles or whatever, but the pegs, they spent

58:03.320 --> 58:07.520
money, lots and lots of money on that movie.

58:07.520 --> 58:11.780
And what really freaks me out is that they bought the rights to all these other board

58:11.780 --> 58:12.780
games too.

58:12.780 --> 58:18.000
They want to do a new clue movie and I'm like, oh my God, no, no, no, no.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.680
The one in the eighties was perfect.

58:20.680 --> 58:22.520
It's a cult classic.

58:22.520 --> 58:28.000
It's Tim Curry at his finest, second finest next to Ferder, third finest next to Ferder

58:28.000 --> 58:34.440
and Pennywise and fourth finest next to Ferder, Pennywise and whatever in Annie.

58:34.440 --> 58:35.440
What?

58:35.440 --> 58:36.440
Oh, what about the demon in Labyrinth?

58:36.440 --> 58:37.440
God damn it.

58:37.440 --> 58:38.440
Okay.

58:38.440 --> 58:39.440
Fifth finest.

58:39.440 --> 58:40.440
Let's just face it.

58:40.440 --> 58:41.440
Tim Curry is always awesome.

58:41.440 --> 58:42.440
Every movie he touches is amazing.

58:42.440 --> 58:43.440
Even in the worst witch, he was awesome.

58:43.440 --> 58:47.920
So like, don't make clue like battleship.

58:47.920 --> 58:50.000
I will cry.

58:50.000 --> 58:55.160
Like I just expect this scene of Ms. Peacock walking these little squares in the, like,

58:55.160 --> 58:56.160
oh my God.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.160
Okay.

58:57.160 --> 59:01.580
And then all of a sudden aliens come from outer space and you know, says you suck my

59:01.580 --> 59:06.840
battleship and uh, you sunk my battleship.

59:06.840 --> 59:07.840
Yeah.

59:07.840 --> 59:13.680
Ism said you sunk my box office sales and Frisbee says you sunk my PT boat.

59:13.680 --> 59:14.680
Uh, yeah.

59:14.680 --> 59:15.680
Oh, Yahtzee movie.

59:15.680 --> 59:16.680
Good idea.

59:16.680 --> 59:17.680
Strelok.

59:17.680 --> 59:18.680
Okay.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.720
Tiger Claw and chat says, you know, despite what you see in the trailer, it could be a

59:20.720 --> 59:24.560
fun popcorn movie if you ignore the fact it's based on a board game.

59:24.560 --> 59:32.080
Go watch the trailer again and then come back and tell me that because maybe getting high

59:32.080 --> 59:35.760
will be fun, but not like the first half of that trailer.

59:35.760 --> 59:36.760
Don't get me wrong.

59:36.760 --> 59:41.440
This is like a really cheesy, you know, this guy's like, you know, he's a loose cannon,

59:41.440 --> 59:44.920
but he's going to, you know, this battleship thing and then they're like, Hey, what's that

59:44.920 --> 59:45.920
out there?

59:45.920 --> 59:46.920
You know, what is that?

59:46.920 --> 59:47.920
You know, I thought, Oh, okay.

59:47.920 --> 59:50.560
Maybe it's another boat that they're doing that, you know, it's kinda like Top Gun where

59:50.560 --> 59:55.640
they're doing exercises and then, you know, Oh, they have to, you know, combat, you know,

59:55.640 --> 59:56.640
the enemy and stuff like that.

59:56.640 --> 01:00:04.040
But then it was an alien and I'm like, okay, I can't follow this at all anymore.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:08.920
I just didn't really have the right, uh, stir lock and chat says monopoly movie.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.920
God damn.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.920
Do they have the rights to monopoly?

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.920
Oh my God.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.800
Why do I just, I just picture this trailer in my mind and I don't know monopoly.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:20.880
I just picture Russell Brand is sitting in a top hat and a monocle going, Oh God, get

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.880
out of jail.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:28.240
Free called, uh, monopoly, uh, Ouija, they're doing a new Ouija, uh, movie.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:33.460
Uh, is it going to be like, Oh, what was the best Ouija movie ever?

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:39.960
The, The Exorcist, seriously, that, that how about which board was based off of a week

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.960
off a Ouija board.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.960
How about which board?

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.960
Anyhow.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960
All right.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.600
I don't want to talk about these horrible movies anymore, although it is, it is related

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.600
to games.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.840
Every single one of these movies will have a game tie into it.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.920
You better believe it.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.640
So there will be something on the Wii that you can get for the battleship movie.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:01.600
That'll be, you know, Liam Neeson yelling, I seven, I do, by the way, have to quote something

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:07.280
from Tumblr if you watch, um, The Exorcist backwards, it's about a girl who's really

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.560
sick and then eat some pea soup and gets better.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.560
Shut up.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:17.760
I, uh, uh, I'll bring it up later, but I'm trying to find that list of movies that they

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760
have.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.560
Maybe we'll save it for like the afterbirth or something, but it's terrible.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.560
I know.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560
All right.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.920
Can we move on?

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.880
Let's talk about other three DS related news real quick.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.320
I think you already know about this, but I've got to just jump in here and say this.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.360
Uh, there are new three DS games coming this holiday season, namely Mario Kart, three DS

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.600
and super Mario three DS.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.680
It's apparently has a name now, the Mario game, which was just kind of snuck in there.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.240
That was the other weird thing about this week and the Nintendo, like all this other

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.440
news that just kind of showed up in the press releases.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:56.000
Like the fact that original NES games were coming to virtual console, that just was kind

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
of, Oh yeah.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.040
Well, since we're giving them away, we're just going to throw that out there.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.160
I have to point out something to LAHA.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.380
There was a dungeon and dragons movie.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.480
It was pretty bad.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.760
Tom Baker was in it.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.800
However, yeah, the kid from cereal mom was in it.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.480
There was a sequel by the way.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:21.240
And just to, um, let you know the movie crawl that came out when I was pretty young, I saw

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.240
it in the theater.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.080
I'll put it that way was supposed to be the dungeon and dragons movie and they lost the

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.640
license for it.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:32.640
So dungeons and dragons has been done for the record though.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.480
I did kind of like the dungeon and dragons and dragons and dragons.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.720
You will believe that a Wayans can be an elf.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.720
He wasn't enough.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.720
What was he?

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.720
He played a human.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.040
I thought he was a human thief.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.040
Really?

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.040
Tom Baker played an elf.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.640
Oh, he played the king of the elves and Tom Baker is awesome because he was the fourth

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.640
doctor.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.640
So shut up everybody.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:57.520
Anyway, Mario Kart seven as it's being called right now, it will be out in December and

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.560
Super Mario 3D land will be out in November.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:07.080
No further information still on Kid Icarus, which is also supposed to be this holiday,

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.160
but they haven't exactly said when that is.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.080
And now there's a little bit of concern that maybe it's not going to make this year.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.040
You know the best part about Mario Kart seven according to Kotaku, it's actually the ninth

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.440
Mario Kart game.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.440
Is it really?

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.440
Yes it is.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.560
What games did they forget?

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.560
Arcade ones.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:26.680
Uh, well I think it's Nintendo didn't really develop the arcade ones.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.040
Didn't Namco do those because that's why it's still Mario Kart.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.560
There was a Pac-Man movie by the way, but it was animated.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.400
They would not be considered canon.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:38.800
I would support calling it Mario Kart seven because the arcade ones are not canon.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.880
They're not as good either.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:46.000
They're really not like they're okay for arcade games I guess, but they're not the same quality

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.360
as the home ones.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.840
And unlike Loki, I love me some Mario Kart and I am looking forward to this new one.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.920
As long as it's not double dash bad, then I am looking forward to the new one.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.200
I did actually have to point out that just about everything that Laha suggested, there

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.380
actually have been movies.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.380
There was a Pac-Man movie.

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.380
It was animated.

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.800
There was a Pac-Man TV show back in the day.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:07.800
Yes there was.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.800
It was the same series.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.800
The movie was in the same series.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.440
There's also Pac-Man save Santa Claus.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.960
Hey I watched it.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.480
You know what my two shows were when I was a kid?

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.060
It was Pac-Man and Qbert.

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.920
I watched the Qbert cartoon too.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920
Alright let's move on.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.440
Half the Line gagged me with a rocket ship.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:29.420
Candyland was also one of the other licenses that they had.

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.800
It was Monopoly Battleship Candyland and Ouija.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.800
Great.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:39.720
I hope Patrick Stewart stars in Candyland.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.960
Set course for Yellow Square.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.960
Engage.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.680
Spock is not impressed.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:50.040
So did they get Chutes and Ladders too?

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.040
Alright.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.440
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.440
How about Hi Ho Cheerio?

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.440
Okay.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.560
How about a story?

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.760
This is stupid.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.000
And I'm gonna say why it's stupid after I read it.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.640
Basically the ESA wants 1.1 million dollars of reimbursement from the state of California

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.360
for the law that failed.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.200
Basically it's for Brown versus EMA.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:16.420
And basically the whole point is that, and this is a quote, California persisted in defending

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:21.060
a law that plaintiffs warned of the legislature was unconstitutional before it passed.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:25.240
That was previously found to be unconstitutional by the district court and a unanimous panel

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:30.400
of the 9th circuit and that is similar to at least 8 other laws invalidated as unconstitutional

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:35.080
prior to the time California sought seriatory in this case.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:40.320
So basically, like, you knew, but you pursued it anyway because you're stupid?

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.320
Pay us.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.400
We spent a lot of money beating your ass.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.640
Pay us.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:55.480
Now California did send, um, a check for $282,794 for reimbursement for legal fees.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:02.440
However, um, we're broke in California.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.640
That's kind of where I'm at.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:09.320
I'm like, I'm like, yeah, ESA kind of deserves it, but at the same time we don't have the

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.500
money right now.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.720
So you just need to...

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.680
I'm going to tell you what's going to happen, ESA.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.600
Listen to me, representatives of the ESA.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.320
This is what's going to happen if you get your money.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:22.280
They're going to find another tax to raise or increase our tuition again or do something

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:29.600
else and it's going to hurt the people you're trying to, that pretty much fund your operation.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.920
This is so hard because I can see it from both sides, but from the ESA, the ESA spent

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.720
a lot of money defending something that should have never been sent a law in the first place.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.680
They were defending our rights.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.720
And so it's kind of like they, they should be entitled to that money.

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.240
But I, I am with you.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:49.000
I know damn well that money is not going to come out of thin air and there's so much...

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It doesn't need to come out of thin air.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.960
It needs to come out of fucking Lila Nee's ass is where it needs to fucking come from.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.040
That's I think that's where the money should come from.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.040
Absolutely.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.120
They need to take it right from the source.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:06.080
I honestly think that any of these politicians that have basically brought up anything like

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.080
this that have failed, that spent our taxpayer dollars, cause you know, he didn't pay anything

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.840
out of pocket for any of this shit.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:17.380
Anything that comes out of our pockets as taxpayers, the ones responsible for the failed

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:20.320
law need to pay and pay it themselves.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.520
He want to put his name on it for all the fucking fame.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.760
Well, you know what?

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:27.680
You put your name on that shit and now you need to pay for it because you know, what

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:31.840
kind of reprimand is he going to get for coming up with this law?

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.040
Obviously he didn't fucking learn anything.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.160
He's like, well, I'm going to just try it again.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.660
You know, it's like, you know, Well, you know what?

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:42.880
This is actually some something, cause you know, here in California, basically we are

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.800
pretty much a direct democracy here.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.440
We can vote on what we want.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:52.200
All you have to do is have enough signatures to put it on the ballot and it can be voted

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.360
on.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:59.140
And this is something that I would seriously sit back and pen a potential, and I've got

01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:03.320
friends that will, you know, will review the legal side of it for me for free.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:08.280
This is something that I would sit back and pen myself that a politician needs to be responsible

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.320
for anything they do that fails.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:14.520
You know, if they cost the taxpayer money on a failed venture, then it needs to come

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.840
out of their personal pocket or they need to have them cut and pay.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:22.320
I don't want to get too political, but I could see, but you wouldn't want to scare off a

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:25.560
politician from doing something that maybe they really should be doing.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.400
You know, there's got, there's, there's a middle ground somewhere.

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.420
I know, but there, and you're right, but we got, you have to be very careful in how you

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:37.680
word something like that is that the court should be able to find the person liable when

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.320
gross negligence is shown.

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:44.760
There needs to be something that the judge could do it, but not like you wouldn't want

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:50.980
all politicians to have to suffer because of people constantly going after rights and

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:51.980
things like that.

01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:55.520
But I mean, but I mean, it would have to be on a case by case basis, but I'm saying in

01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:02.640
particular or something like this, and this is why I honestly don't, don't get me started.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.960
I have a big problem with politicians in general, except for, you know, the ones that are pretty

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.260
much putting out their own money for stuff that needs to be done because they're still

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.560
out there.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:17.060
But this, and again, we're broke in California.

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:22.600
We have no money, even though we have some of the highest grossing, you know, income

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:29.540
people in the country that live in our state, are they being taxed any more, you know, relatively

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.360
any more than we are?

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.320
No, because of Republicans.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.280
Anyway, but I'm saying that when you come to the point that we don't have any more money

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:43.840
to pay on any of this and they're still going and pursuing stuff that they know is going

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:49.640
to cost us money, what's the point?

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.060
And when is that going to stop?

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.240
They're going to keep doing stupid shit.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.880
Just look at all the, look at all the dumb laws they have in San Francisco.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.880
Seriously.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880
Yeah.

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.920
And they were going to try to ban circumcision.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:03.000
The whole circumcision thing that went on the ballot and had to be thrown out.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.440
I think it was thrown out by a judge that it's not going to be on the ballot because,

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.440
you know, it was just too ridiculous or whatever legal thing they decided.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.800
And besides that, it is, it would infringe on religious rights, so.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.800
Right.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.160
But I mean, it's just so- But it's like, who paid for that?

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.800
Who paid for that whole process?

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.520
They pay, the reason why I think it's so expensive to live in San Francisco is because they have

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.080
a bunch of ridiculous laws that aren't necessary.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.960
None of us elsewhere have to deal with it.

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.000
Just in San Francisco, they have this shit.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.080
But I mean, I don't want to get too political here, but some could look and say, in San

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.720
Francisco, everyone has health care.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.720
We'll see.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.720
Okay.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720
That's one I agree with.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.320
But I'm saying there's other- Anyhow, all right.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.880
We got to, we got to not.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.400
I think Jamie needs a spinoff show that's political.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.480
No cause then I would be harsh and have a headache.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.480
Called Stitchin' Bitch.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.480
All right.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.480
Let's move on.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.040
Uh, Loki, what do you have for us?

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.040
Back to gaming.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.480
Uh, GameStop is now prepared to offer downloadable PC purchases at retail, much like they do

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:12.360
right now with digital purchases for DLC and stuff like that.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:15.320
I mean, great if you want to do that.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.640
I mean, if you're trading used items for, like, download content or something like that.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:25.920
But I mean, much like I don't see the point in download content being purchased at retail,

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:29.960
I don't really see the point of buying a digital PC title at retail.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:36.000
I mean, shit, if you're going to go to retail to buy a digital title, like, say, you know,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.840
any game that's out there now that, you know, it's like a major game, like, say like a Deus

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:43.720
Ex, Human Revolution, or something like that, just buy the boxed copy.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:47.840
I mean, if you're going to fucking pay money for it at retail anyways, why are you going

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.640
to pay money for a code to go download it for digitally?

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.640
I mean, it's just...

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.920
I think GameCroc's just trying to do what they have to do to stay relevant, but it ain't

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920
going to work.

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920
Period.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.160
Yeah, I mean, they're saying that, like, for example, uh, the first game, yeah, actually,

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:06.680
Deus Ex is the first game that'll be an in-store digital purchase, says those who purchase

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:10.920
the digital versions will also receive downloads for the original Deus Ex Game of the Year

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.040
edition and Deus Ex Invisible War.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.800
So that's kind of how you get a little bit of extra stuff.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:20.920
Customers will also receive explosive mission DLC and double power-up rewards points.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.320
I mean, I guess that's cool if you want all those extras.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:29.040
I mean, I know Steam does a lot of, like, extras like that as well.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:35.240
I guess it's just really, you know, if that's important to you, then I'd go that route.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:40.960
But if you're just looking to buy, you know, digital stuff, I mean, it's kind of like the

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.160
whole point of buying digital in the first place is so you don't have to go to the store.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.800
But I guess if you're young enough and you don't have a credit card or something like

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.840
that, then that may be the only way to go.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.640
But I still think it's ridiculous.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.640
But whatever, you know.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.280
It's what they want to do.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.560
Power to the players, as they say.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.320
It'd be really neat if I could, like, get into the used game market with this stuff.

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:07.960
Like, I should be able to, like, Steam, revoke my access to a game and I get, like, a credit

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:12.240
to use on the store and then somebody else can buy the game at a reduced price or something.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:16.960
I know that'll never happen, but if you think about it, they could do something where the

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.440
publisher would get a cut of that.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.580
And that doesn't happen right now in the retail stores.

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:26.260
There could be a way, if publishers are smarter about the used game market, where they could

01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:29.000
get a cut of it.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.080
And I'm not just talking these $10 online passes, but whatever.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:40.080
Anyhow, moving on, speaking of prices, Xbox Live Arcade.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.800
Have you noticed something about the games on Xbox Live Arcade?

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.840
Yeah, the points have been slowly rising.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.040
That's right, the cost of the games have been rising on Xbox Live.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.840
So far, in 2011, there have been 20 1200-plus games.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:00.060
Last year, 27 of the 85 games released for the service cost 1200 points or more.

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.640
So we're already at 20 for this year.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:09.360
So that was an 8% increase in itself over 2009, when 21 titles hit that price point.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.520
Now they are saying that, well, we have to blame the fact that the quality of games we're

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:17.160
basically making is a lot higher too.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:22.040
Limbo and Castle Crashers, they're as good as anything else that's out on the market.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.040
What do you guys think?

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.880
Do you think that Xbox Live Arcade games are getting better and therefore they're worth

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:33.520
the extra money, or do you think this is just inflation when we're not paying attention?

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.240
I think it's inflation.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.080
I think it's a little bit of a mix of both.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:42.520
I think, yes, it's inflation going on, but at the same time, you really don't see anymore

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.220
like just crappy, lazy arcade ports.

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:51.120
Ever since Microsoft banned those from the service, you don't see any more of this just

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:55.760
re-release of an old-ass game that's 400 Microsoft points.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.760
Most of the stuff that's coming out now definitely had a lot of development dollars put into

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.000
it with mixed success.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Some of it's really good.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Some of it's not so good.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.520
It just depends on what kind of games you're into.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.000
I think it's a little bit of both.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
And you know what?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
That's fine.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.120
They want to put out $20 games because you don't have to buy them, and no one's forcing

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.120
you to buy them.

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.120
And you know what?

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.040
If you're smart, you wait, and then sometimes when that game pops up onto the deal of the

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.840
week, then you buy it for a cheaper price.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.840
And I still do.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.600
I will say one thing I do love is that you still get the demos, and that's something

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.720
you can't always get at a retail store.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.840
So that is one thing I really like.

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.560
And I can really, really try a game before I buy it.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.960
So Xbox Live Arcade, even though the prices are creeping up, as long as the quality stays

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:46.340
good, I mean, there's been a lot of good arcade games I've played lately, I guess it's okay.

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.340
So we'll see.

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:48.340
Dar Sakura.

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:51.840
Well, in other news, this actually is for our UK listeners.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.480
The shop game restarted its Play Now, Trade Later deal.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:02.920
So basically, you can buy a game and trade it in at a guaranteed amount, so you essentially

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.120
end up paying 5 pounds for your game.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:14.280
And the games that are included on this list is UFC Trainer for Wii, Cars 2 on DS, Art

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:18.800
Academy, Calaveras the Cartel, Hunted, The Demon's Forge, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.640
Part 2 for Wii.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.880
So it's a number of games, you'd have to check with your local game store to find out.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.640
But this is going, basically if you trade in any of those games for credit before August

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.040
12th, they'll effectively cost 5 pounds.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.000
You can use the credit on any future purchase.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.200
So that's pretty good, I mean, it's a good way to save money, especially if these are

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.600
games that you got and you're kind of like, eh, meh.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:48.360
Sounds like a really weird way of doing like a demo or like a rental service.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:53.640
Well, in February, they also had one where it guaranteed a 35 pound trade in for shooters

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.440
like Killzone 3 and Bulletstorm.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.960
So it's a good way to basically revolt stock.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:00.960
So.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:01.960
Hmm.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:04.200
Well, we'll see how successful this is.

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.080
I don't know, none of those games are making me go, ooh, gotta get it.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:10.800
I mean, granted, I live in the wrong country anyway, but we'll see.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.400
Well, good luck.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.920
Alright, well, let's travel the world and talk about release dates and what upcoming

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:22.640
games you could maybe get a 5 pound deal or a 5 dollar deal on later.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:29.680
Well, not a whole lot this week, and at least there's some games coming up this week, because

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:33.840
there's a few weeks coming up here where there's nothing.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:36.680
Starting off, Phineas and Ferb, Across the Second Dimension.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.680
I love Phineas and Ferb.

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.320
It's coming out on PlayStation 3 with move support.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.040
How much is it?

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:46.000
We, I believe, 40 dollars.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.560
Do you love Phineas and Ferb, 40 dollars much?

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.960
No, I'll just keep watching episodes off the internet.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.960
There you go.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.040
Well, it's not a bad game, actually.

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.040
It's done by the people who did Ratchet and Clank, so, you know, if you like Ratchet and

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.240
Clank, then it might be worth picking up.

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:06.520
So yeah, Phineas and Ferb, yeah, 40 dollars retail on PlayStation 3, Wii, and the DS.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:12.120
Well, DS, of course, is 30, not 40, that'd be ridiculous.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:17.400
Sesame Street, Ready Set Grover coming out on the DS and the Wii, DS version has a funny

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.400
little Grover stylus.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.240
Aw, bummer, I thought it might be that Kinect game that they were showing at E3.

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.280
No, no, that got delayed.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:30.480
Sesame, on the Wii version, you get a Grover fuzzy Wii remote cover.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.480
Wait, wait, you said that really quick, that got delayed?

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.960
Delayed to when, next year?

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.840
No, just in the fall.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:39.840
Like October.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.560
Oh, I guess, I thought that was when it was always set to come out.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.720
Mmm, it was August at one point.

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:56.160
But anyways, um, and then of course, let's see here, is that really it?

01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:02.160
Oh yeah, I forgot, Saints Row Special Edition 2-pack, they're basically re-releasing the

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.480
Saints Row double pack that they had a while ago where you can get one and two, but this

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:10.920
also gives you early access to the Initiation Station demo that they're gonna be having

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.040
coming out later on.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:19.240
Bleach Soul Resurrection for the Playstation 3, this is gonna be kind of like a Dice Warrior

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:26.000
type of game, also you get three free episodes, or the anime episodes on Playstation Network

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.240
with that, you get a voucher for that, it's kinda cool.

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:38.160
Sniper Ghost Warrior Extended Edition, that's coming out on 360, and that's it.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:43.360
I love the enthusiasm in the chatroom shown by Sturlok at chat.hornslaunchradio.com.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:50.040
Sturlok says, yay Grover, he was my favorite when I was a kid, him and Cookie Monster.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:56.600
Back in my day, Elmo didn't exist on the old school Sesame Street back when I was a kid.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.000
Which we like to refer to as the good old days.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.160
That's right.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:04.360
Brakeman says, I preferred the Muppets, I liked Muppet Babies, but it was always about

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.360
Fraggle Rock.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.120
I don't know about you guys, but anyhow.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.320
Fraggle Rock is awesome.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:12.440
Alright, going to Japanese release dates, it's kind of a slow week over there as well,

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:15.800
but on the Xbox 360 this week you get a couple of price reductions, including Assassin's

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:20.560
Creed Brotherhood Special Edition and Tropico 3 both move into the Platinum Collection,

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:23.400
that's on the 4th of August on the Xbox 360.

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:28.600
Going over to the Playstation 3, we have Assassin's Creed Brotherhood there as well, and then

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:34.080
another game getting a price reduction, this has a whopper of a name, it's R. Tonelico

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:41.360
3, Sekai Shun no Hikigane wa Shujo no Utagahajuku gets a price reduction this week.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.860
I have no idea what game this is.

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:43.860
This looks like...

01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:45.520
It's R. Tonelico.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.720
It's a role playing game, and of course it looks like you can dress the little girls

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:54.840
up as bunnies in the game, and I can see a little item shop in some of these pictures.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.920
The game looks kind of cool, but I don't think we have this here.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:57.920
Yeah we do.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.040
Not number 3 I don't think, we have number 2 at least.

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:01.040
What game is this?

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.040
It's R. Tonelico.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.040
Oh.

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.040
I didn't know that was out here.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.040
Yeah, it's out here.

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.040
Oh, there you go.

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.040
It looks interesting, maybe I'll check it out.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:13.120
Alright, let's see, moving on to other consoles, I don't know if Nintendo has anything on their

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:19.320
lineup that I will check, but I can't do the PSP, we do have a couple games there.

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:26.560
We have Storm Lover, Summer Love from D3, Toriyoko, Gourmet Survival, what is that, like

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.560
Iron Chef or Die?

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.560
Gourmet Survival!

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:33.320
No, it doesn't look like it has anything to do with cooking.

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:37.080
It does look like some type of like you're fighting dinosaurs and gorillas, like you

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.920
take on primates.

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:45.480
Like look at that, this dude's fighting like the guy at the top of the Matterhorn at Disneyland.

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.200
That's what it looks like.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:51.640
Man vs Beast, that's what that is.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:57.040
That's on the PSP this week, as well as Yuusha 32nd from Marvelous comes out this week as

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.040
well.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.000
I wonder if that's a version of 30 Second Hero, or Half Minute, oh yes it is, it's Half

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.960
Minute Hero Part 2 comes out this week in Japan, that could be a lot of fun.

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:12.560
So that's on the PSP this week, and going to the Nintendo Wii, Epic Mickey gets a release

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.040
in Japan this week finally, so they must have localized it for Japan, I know Disney's pretty

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.200
big over there, so they probably took a little while for them to localize it all.

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.440
They had to add Duffy to it.

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.440
Maybe.

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.160
Because Duffy is bigger than Mickey in Japan.

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.160
Is it really?

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.600
Actually Duffy is pretty big.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:33.040
Family fishing as well on the Wii, and lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Nazo Waku Yakata

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:36.760
Otono Aida Ni Ade Ni comes out.

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:40.920
This looks like, is this a Professor Layton game?

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.400
It would appear so.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:46.560
So it's Professor Layton's Haunted Mansion or something like that on the 3DS.

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:49.960
There you go, your Japanese release dates.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.920
As I horribly butcher the names as I always do.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.080
In Europe, two things.

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:58.040
Limbo for PC and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.040
On Xbox 360.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.240
That is an awesome game.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.240
That's it.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.240
That is an incredibly awesome game.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:06.600
I heard it was not leaked early, but there was some URL where you could get the game

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.000
early through the store or something.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
How is it?

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Haven't played it yet.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
But I want to.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I haven't got a chance to play it.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I got it downloaded.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.800
So how do you know it's amazing?

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.800
Based on the videos.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.800
Oh I see.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.080
I'm making an assumption based on trailers.

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.080
It looks amazing.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.680
I'm just giving you crap.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.400
It looks monochrome.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:30.920
Well, it's got a unique art style to it.

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:35.220
Insanely Twisted.

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:40.680
So let's talk a little bit more about earnings and lack thereof.

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:49.280
THQ is disappointed in their earnings for fiscal quarter 2, including Red Faction and

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.080
the performance of that.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:54.600
And they are thinking, of course, quarter 3 could be its best.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:59.880
Oh I'm sorry, it was quarter 1 that they were pissed off about.

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:03.000
These fiscal quarters get confusing.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.560
Of course they are saying, sales of Red Faction Armageddon and our licensed kid titles were

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.740
below expectations.

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:15.320
The late release of UFC Personal Trainer also adversely impacted the quarter.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:23.120
You know, THQ, I mean, you had a Kung Fu Panda game come out and you decided to make it You

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.120
Draw Only.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:30.140
Not a good choice, I gotta say.

01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:35.200
Of course they are saying that the net loss of $38.4 million, and most of the losses are

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.320
from deferred revenue.

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:43.960
Of course the company is not counting yet, because it's going towards their online services

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.960
for its games.

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:52.480
And of course Q3 for them is going to be Saints of the Third, WWE 12, and the You Draw tablet

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.560
for the 360 and PS3, among other things.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:03.680
Red Faction did so poorly that it will not be continuing on in any meaningful way.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.760
So it is done, fortunately.

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:10.000
Your break man is crying in our chat room over the death of Red Faction.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
How do you feel about it, Loki?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Weren't you a fan of that series?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Nope.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Never really.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Why not?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I just didn't play it.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
It's not that I don't like it or anything.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I mean, it looked cool.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
It's volition.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I love volition.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.200
So it's part your fault that the series died, basically.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.760
Yeah, it's because I didn't buy it.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:24.760
Exactly.

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:32.600
So if you are mad about the death of Red Faction, just send those cards and letters to Loki.

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.600
So yeah.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:36.400
It just didn't do that well.

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.160
And you would have thought, you know, a game with a unicorn that shoots rainbows out of

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.160
its ass.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.160
It would have been awesome.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.920
Which, by the way, I hope to God that they bring that weapon over to Saints Row the Third,

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.720
because that would be amazing.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:53.120
And then of course, one of the things that they were experimenting with, starting with

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.800
MX vs ATV, is releasing a game for a lower price point and then hoping to make that money

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.880
up back with download content.

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.720
So they did try that with MX vs ATV Alive.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:12.500
They put it out at $39.99, and their idea was of course to come out with a robust product

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:17.360
at $39.99 price point, build a large install base more quickly, and then monetize that

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:22.080
install base through rapid and large number of DLC drops.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.600
Unfortunately it didn't work.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.040
It says, the only problem is the game didn't move enough units to turn, or in turn, move

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:32.960
enough download content to make the experiment a success.

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:39.840
So the key to learning was that it was not a successful experiment.

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.960
The $39.99 price point, while good, gave us good acceleration of sales, but that wasn't

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:49.520
enough to drive the install base where we wanted it to be, obviously.

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.480
It just wasn't working out.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:59.200
Break Man in chat is calling you Darth Loki.

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.640
He's very upset about this whole Red Faction thing, just so you know.

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:04.440
You know who you need to blame, okay?

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:08.360
You know who put their logo onto that game?

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.360
That would be Syfy.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:12.800
Syfy Channel had a fucking movie.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.880
That was Syfy Games.

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:22.880
If you want to talk about someone putting out a poor product, that would be Syfy.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.560
So that's who you need to blame.

01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.440
So yeah, that kind of sucks for them, but at least you know what?

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:33.600
I can guarantee that Quarter 3 is going to be amazing, because fucking Saints for the

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.600
Third.

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.080
That shit is going to sell like crazy.

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.080
Nice.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:43.480
Alright, well, part of me didn't want to talk about this next story, but this next story

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.720
just really makes me angry.

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:50.120
There's so much to hate in this next story, and I apologize for bringing it up, but you

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.120
know what?

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:55.840
This should piss you off too, because you have the power to change things.

01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:01.560
As you guys know, if you ever watch a television, you know that there was a horrible, horrible

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:08.240
tragedy in Norway this past week, and you had this just crazy asshole, and I'm not even

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.240
going to say his name.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.440
I'm not going to show you his picture, because he doesn't deserve to have it shown.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:17.500
He's a crazy asshole, and he blew up a building, and he shot a bunch of kids at a camp, because

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:20.800
I guess he was afraid of what they were going to grow up into or something like that.

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.820
Just bullshit excuse for doing a crazy, batshit, stupid thing that killed like 77 people, including

01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.200
a bunch of teenagers, which is beyond fucked.

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:33.040
I mean, this guy is worse than Satan.

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:34.960
He's worse than Satan's farts.

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:35.960
He's just terrible.

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.760
He's a terrible human being, but yeah.

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:45.480
So anyway, obviously, this horrific thing happened, and what happens when a horrific

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:46.880
situation happens?

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.940
You want to blame something.

01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:48.940
You want to blame someone?

01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:49.940
You want to blame something.

01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:51.800
So why am I bringing it up here on Orange Lawns Radio?

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:52.800
Guess who got blamed?

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:53.800
Video game.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:54.800
That's right.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.120
Video game retailers have pulled World of Warcraft and Call of Duty after the shooting,

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:05.240
some of the big retailers, because I guess this asshole wrote some manifesto that either

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.320
talked about the games.

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:12.120
I think he had actually said he learned how to shoot or whatever in Call of Duty, which

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:17.320
I don't know why you would take what a crazy asshole says at face value, but whatever.

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:24.360
I mean, this just infuriates me, because it's like, don't pay attention to this stupid asshole.

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:29.960
By banning these games, I feel like you're validating what he says, and that's the last

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.800
thing you should do in a situation like this.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.400
It's so irritating.

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:39.820
He said that Warcraft provided a useful cover story for the time he spent in seclusion plotting

01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:41.440
his terrorist attacks.

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:46.000
So it wasn't even that he was playing WoW, it's just saying he was playing WoW made it

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.680
for a good excuse.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:53.000
And then playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was a way to keep his skills honed.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.860
So the retailers Co-Op Norway and Plate Companyit, I can't say these Norwegian names, but something

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.760
like that, they pulled the games.

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:07.080
They are saying it's a temporary removal, but as far as I'm concerned, you know what,

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.360
don't validate this guy.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.360
Irritating.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:16.320
Now, we will say this, Spaceworld is another retailer, they refused to pull the games,

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.920
saying it saw no connection between the games and the tragedy.

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:25.320
Quote, we have never seen any research that games alone have led to such incidents.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:30.920
So if you live in Norway, that would be A plus Spaceworld, F minus these other guys.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.760
So shame on that.

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:38.440
But then of course, it doesn't end there.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:41.600
There was a very interesting opinion piece that showed up on a Forbes blog.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.420
Of course, Forbes magazine, hugely financial, right?

01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:49.000
And so this guy, now granted, this is an opinion piece, but he talks about an expert saying

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
that if you blame video games for the tragic massacres, like what happened in Norway, what

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.320
happened in Columbine, it's racist.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:03.400
I don't know if that's the word I would choose to use, but I guess that's what this

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.120
article is saying here.

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:09.600
Clinical psychologist Christopher Ferguson, a leading expert on video game violence and

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:14.520
mass killings at Texas A&M International University said, video games aren't to blame for the

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.160
tragedy, nor is Doom, nor is Quake, and so on.

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:23.920
In fact, he believes that placing the blame on video games whenever a white male is guilty

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:28.360
of a killing spree is racist.

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:34.920
Weird, but I can't say he's told, I don't know.

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:39.040
Keep in mind, keep in mind, and this is something that needs to be defined for the entirety

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.960
of America.

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:45.920
Racism does not mean white against black, white against this.

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:50.200
It means one race against another.

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.560
Or it's making a judgment based on racial factors only.

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:55.560
Correct.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:01.340
And this time he's saying because white males commit heinous acts, instantly blaming

01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:04.960
video games is racist.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:05.960
I would say bigoted.

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:06.960
Yeah, I know.

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:07.960
That's a better word.

01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:10.200
Racist just isn't the right word for me.

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.840
But it is sort of profiling.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:13.840
That's a good word.

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:14.840
Profiling.

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:19.920
But racist, I think that word cuts really deep.

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:25.880
For lack of the better, or maybe just for, you know, shock value, but it really is profiling

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:29.320
and a bit of bigotry.

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:30.320
Yeah.

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.120
That's what it is.

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:36.040
And the doctor goes on to say, mass killings are going to happen and there's nothing anyone

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.440
can do about it.

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:41.560
Fortunately, they're not going to happen very often, but they're like lightning strikes.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:46.240
Let's see, quote, I know it's a little controversial to say, but there's a certain type of racism

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.800
in place of these killings.

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:51.880
When shootings happen in an inner city in minority populated schools, video games are

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:52.880
never brought up.

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:56.640
But when these things happen in white majority schools and in the suburbs, people start to

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.920
freak out and video games are inevitably blamed.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:03.320
I think that there's a certain element of racism or ignorance here.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:07.640
People really want to know what kind of boogeyman we can hang this on and video games are still

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:11.280
the top choice when it comes to any type of tragedy.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:15.800
If you want to read more on this, you can go to blog.forbes.com and read the full article

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:16.800
there.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.800
Let me read another quote from this.

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:22.160
It's just really interesting, for lack of a better word.

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:25.760
There are groups out there who are going to blame video games on everything.

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.040
They're like ambulance chasers, really.

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:32.000
I think it's irresponsible and thoughtless to try to make political gain off of someone

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.760
else's tragedy, but they're going to do it.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:35.760
That's what they do.

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:38.800
But even those groups have been much quieter with the Oslo tragedy.

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:42.720
And you know, we had another follow up story in our show role that I neglected to copy

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:47.400
the link for, but in a nutshell, some crazy religious group is trying to get the games

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.680
banned here in the U.S. because of the Norway shooting.

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:52.360
And that quote I agree with.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:58.540
These guys are like ambulance chasers to push their own agenda and they are exploiting a

01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:02.800
disgusting scenario to promote their own agenda and that is sick.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.640
And that part I agree with.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:09.000
So really fascinating study.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I don't know.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Draw your own opinions.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Choose your own words.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
But, you know.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.040
Well, you know, you know what the whole thing is?

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:21.440
And this is my little commentary on the whole situation.

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:24.400
Stop looking for something to blame other than the people themselves.

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.400
Yeah.

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.120
Kaishudo in the chat room says, Rob, don't jump on the side of one nut case that goes

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:31.240
against another nut case's view.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.540
I'm not totally with this guy.

01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:37.720
Like I said, I get what he's saying, but I don't know if racism would be the word I'd

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:38.720
use.

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.200
Like profiling, like Jamie said, I think is maybe a better word to use.

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:47.000
But, you know, when he does talk about the ambulance chaser and how people will use these

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.560
situations to promote their own agendas, I will say, yes, I agree with him on that.

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:56.920
Weren't we just talking about politicians and the whole Supreme Court thing earlier?

01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:02.420
I mean, wasn't that all kind of promoting Leland Yee's own political agenda and continuing

01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:04.520
to promote his own?

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:10.860
I mean, that part, I am with him and a certain Lord Voldemort wouldn't have done this in

01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:12.160
the past at all.

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:20.960
Well, and that's really, again, I think a failing of society in general that and OK,

01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:28.940
I think that if you look at things maybe a hundred years ago or look into another culture,

01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:34.220
people will were more likely to own up to what was their mistake.

01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:39.440
It was considered the mature thing, the honorable thing to do, to own up to your own mistake,

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:47.880
to put the blame where it was to not make those who were circumstantially a part of

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.120
it, pay for it.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:56.280
But those who are specifically responsible for it instead, now we have this, oh, well,

01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:01.240
you're so outraged and yeah, OK, the person who did it is in jail, but we want to blame

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.300
it on something else because we want more punishment.

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.760
We want a little bit more drama out of this.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.540
It's drama whoring is what it is.

01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:09.600
People want more drama.

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.960
And really, it should be.

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:15.800
X person was criminally insane.

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:17.600
I don't care what they did.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:25.240
I don't care if they played My Little Pony, you know, while wearing mantis and and doing

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:27.000
ballet in a little pink, really, too, too.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.280
I don't care.

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.280
I do not care.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:32.080
I don't care that J. Edgar Hoover was a transvestite.

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:33.080
He was a bastard.

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:35.800
Him being a transvestite had nothing to do with being a bastard.

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.760
All those things, by the way, that she mentioned before are able to be done in Dead Rising

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:42.760
2 off the record.

01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:43.760
Yes, that is true.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:50.960
Capcom has your your weird, sick, twisted, I'm sorry, but the word Capcom is still a

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:54.080
I have a bad Pavlov's response to that word this week.

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:59.320
But my my point being is that whatever they did in their private life, whatever they do

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:06.840
on the side has nothing to do with their final action.

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:10.640
It may have been, OK, well, I've done all this and it's led up to this point.

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.520
But really, it's what goes on in the head.

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:19.200
If they're not right in the head, they're not going to do something right to begin with.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:24.660
If they're crazy, OK, yeah, maybe they'll get some pleasure out of playing a video game

01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:28.760
for a little while, but they're going to need something else a little bit later.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:34.800
It's just a bump on, you know, a ripple in the ocean, if that makes sense.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.880
It's a little pebble in the pond on the way to the big boulder falling in and damming

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:39.880
the whole thing.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.020
Does that make sense?

01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:48.240
It does, but I'm just this whole thing is just I just irritates me.

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:50.940
I'm just sick of the blame game.

01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:53.800
That's a big problem with society.

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:59.880
People need to freakin grow up and also have the maturity to put the blame on who it needs

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:02.880
to be put on, which is the person who did it.

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:05.320
It doesn't matter what else they're into.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:10.640
You know, they could be into like latex fetish porn.

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:13.880
He could have been a concert trained piano player.

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:17.720
OK, like, OK, the guy in Japan who was the cannibal.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:20.680
Oh, I'm using him as example.

01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:24.560
He was a cultured, respected person.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:31.040
He was smart, lived a very good life, but he ate some chick that he went out on dinner

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:32.040
with.

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:35.320
He just gave into the temptation of flesh, which, by the way, now he's actually a paid

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:36.320
lecturer.

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.320
Just letting you know.

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:43.320
Ah, and I hear he's eating it up all the attention, but my point is fired.

01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:44.320
OK.

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.320
All right.

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:49.160
So here's another here's another example, and I'm not just saying this because I'm Jewish.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.160
Hitler.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:53.880
Oh, God, failed painter.

01:38:53.880 --> 01:39:01.160
He failed his entrance into a prestigious art school, so he joined the military.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.200
He was a vegetarian.

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:10.680
You would not assume vegetarian and painter would lead to mass murderer, but it did.

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:15.160
Are you going to blame all vegetarians and painters now for being potential mass murdering

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.160
fuckheads?

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:17.160
Well, vegetarians, maybe.

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.160
I'm kidding.

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.160
I'm kidding.

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.160
I'm kidding.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:24.920
A little pita is just psycho anyway, but no, Jamie, you really murdered that onion in your

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:25.920
salad.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:33.640
But but my point is, but my point is, you know, it doesn't matter what their hobbies

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:34.640
are.

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.800
It doesn't matter the walk of life they come from.

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.800
Crazy is fucking crazy.

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.440
And you blame the person.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.160
You don't see anybody blaming vegetarians for, you know, one hundred thousand people

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:44.160
being killed.

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:46.200
You don't see anyone blaming Hitler.

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:49.760
Legend of Zaku in our chat room says, Jamie, you have to accept that playing the blame

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.320
game ever since the Salem witch trials and you see what happened then.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:56.320
A bunch of innocent people died.

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.000
You think we'd learn from history?

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.580
No, because people are stupid.

01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:01.040
There may have been some witches in there.

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.040
We don't know.

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:05.480
All right.

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.480
Enough.

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.480
Enough.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:09.740
On that note, Loki has effectively killed the conversation.

01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:11.580
So let's change things up a bit.

01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:16.920
I need some happy goddammit.

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:21.080
Every week here on the show, Dark Soccer takes a trip down memory lane and visits a classic

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:22.080
video game.

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.920
She says, hey, you need to be playing this game.

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:25.920
What?

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.080
I do have to repeat what William said.

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:29.080
All right.

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.160
The fallacy of correlation equals causation.

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:34.680
Now, can we do the classic game?

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:35.680
Yes.

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.360
Dark Soccer wins the classic game of the week.

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.360
StarTropics.

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:42.600
At least you picked a really good classic game of the week.

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:45.120
You know, I actually didn't really play that game all that much.

01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.120
Really?

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.120
Yeah.

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:52.440
But it's such a cool, but I remember playing it and enjoying it when I did, I just got

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.440
lazy.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.600
My best friend in fourth grade and I stayed up all night playing this game.

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.280
But it's a lot of people's favorite games.

01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:00.600
So it's like, why shouldn't I bring up StarTropics, right?

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:01.600
Right.

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.480
So it was an action adventure RPG.

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:09.520
It came out by Nintendo in 1990 for the NES, and it was never released or intended to be

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:10.520
released in Japan.

01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:14.840
It only came out in North America and Europe, but it was designed by Japanese designers

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:20.860
who lived in the U.S., written and directed by Genyo Takeda of Nintendo Integrated Research

01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:23.740
and Development, who also gave us Punch-Out!

01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:29.320
And it came out on the North American Virtual Console on January 7th, 2008, and on the PAL

01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:31.640
region on January 11th.

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:35.280
And of course I had a sequel, which was Zoda's Revenge, StarTropics 2, in 1994.

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:38.840
That was the year I, not telling people what I did.

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:43.040
So you start off as, I graduated high school.

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:49.280
Mike Jones is visiting his uncle, who is named Dr. J and he lives on Sea Island.

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:53.960
And he finds that Dr. J has gone missing and Babu, his assistant, who also sounds a lot

01:41:53.960 --> 01:42:01.520
like Baloo from the Jungle Book, lets Mike use the submarine to basically go look for

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:08.680
Dr. J. So it starts off all of his adventures, he thinks aliens are involved, and basically

01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:14.560
he finds Dr. J by the wreckage of an alien escape pod.

01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:21.400
So they think it's the Argonians, so he has to go to another ship and do all this stuff.

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.400
And then Zoda comes!

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.440
And I'm not going to say any more, because there's more stuff to the game than just what

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:27.440
I'm saying.

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.440
And there's also children adoption involved too.

01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:31.800
I just thought I'd mention that.

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.800
But you don't adopt the children.

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:35.560
No, you don't adopt children.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.600
So basically it's a 2D top down perspective, kind of like Zelda in the dungeon areas.

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:48.760
But it is linear, consistent storyline, and the story progresses basically with talking

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.360
to NPCs and doing certain actions.

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:55.120
And then you have to, you know, go to your little dungeon-y areas.

01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:04.640
So it switches mechanics there where it has a zoomed in type of perspective.

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:11.520
So basically you get weapons and items, baseball themed in many cases.

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:17.080
And you basically, well you also get baseballs but they're called wonder horse hides.

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:25.200
And cleats known as spikes and bullas and shuriken and slingshots and mirrors and different

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.200
types of stuff.

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:29.600
But basically you get all kinds of things that help you progress through the game and

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.560
fight all of the various baddies.

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:38.000
So you get a life meter of 22 hearts, kind of like Link.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.600
In fact it looks a lot like, you know, the Legend of Zelda life bar.

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:46.520
And you can find big hearts that are again like the heart containers in Zelda.

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:50.440
And you can get vitamin X that fills up all of your hearts.

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:56.480
Even though, you know, you will lose of course help when you take damage.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:03.640
So you can also get try your luck signs that are, you know, basically can give you extra

01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:04.640
lives in the game.

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.840
You only start off with three.

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.600
And if you lose all of your lives at the beginning of a dungeon, I mean in a dungeon then you'll

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:13.600
have to go back to the beginning.

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:15.640
So basically you've got, you know, your boss characters.

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:18.200
It's RPG stuff.

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:25.640
So it's, you know, like I said, I didn't get to play a whole bunch of it, but I know a

01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.640
lot of people liked it.

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:30.360
We got to talk about the letter that came with the game.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.360
Yes, yes.

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.440
There was a letter.

01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:36.560
My friend, we had no idea that this was, Oh my God, it was the coolest fucking thing when

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.520
you were like nine or 10.

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:44.840
You get a parchment letter and actually not, not, not any, like it actually came with the

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:47.960
box, like just, you know, it's not, she's not talking about like something you get in

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:48.960
the game.

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:50.320
It was a tangible thing that came in the box.

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:52.320
Made of parchment.

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.320
Yes.

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:56.760
And basically it has a letter from Dr. Jones addressed to Mike.

01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:02.740
And I, by the way, I actually did have a copy of the letter because when I rented Star Tropics

01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:08.360
back in the day, they included the letter with the rental and I kept it.

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:15.400
Um, but basically, um, it's like you intercepted the letter and we're being, uh, invited to

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:18.720
play the game on Mike's behalf.

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:23.800
And then, um, you get a message from your uncle, evil aliens from a distant planet tell

01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:26.160
Mike to dip my letter in water.

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:35.600
So if you have the letter, the original letter, then you could, um, put, um, what was that

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.600
thing with the water?

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:37.600
That had the secret message?

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.600
Yeah.

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:39.600
The letter you, whatever.

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:40.600
Yeah.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.600
Subcode in it.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:42.600
Yeah.

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.600
And I think it was supposed to be able to do it without damaging the letter.

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:45.600
Yeah.

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.600
Oh yeah.

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.600
You could do it without damaging the letter.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.600
Yeah.

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:49.600
But, um, but you had a secret message in there.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:54.320
I think it had like, I, if I remember right, there was a spot, a very specific spot where

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:55.680
you would drip the water.

01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:57.680
I can't totally recall.

01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:58.680
Actually.

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:00.280
I'm going to see if I can find a picture of the letter.

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:07.280
I remember the code was seven 47 and is they actually like an airplane, Nintendo power

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:13.360
or was asked the question enough because people that rented the game or sometimes their letter

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:16.220
would be damaged or missing in the package.

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:19.040
So Nintendo power actually printed it after a while.

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.040
Yeah.

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:22.320
I had the call into the hotline because I bought it used.

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.320
Yeah.

01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:26.440
It's kind of one of those things that like in retrospect, it probably wasn't a very good

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:27.440
idea.

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:31.840
Like Ubisoft don't pay attention to the letter thing.

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:36.880
Can you imagine that coming back as did as rights, uh, copyright protection.

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:41.000
Remember back in the day on the, uh, sorry, Jamie, but on the PC games, like the old school

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.820
PC games, we'd have to like thumb to page 26 of the manual and read the symbol that's

01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:48.400
on there or get the plastic card that came with the game.

01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.240
And I'm going to go all this insane copy protection back in the day.

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.200
That's kind of what this sounds like, but that one was cool.

01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:02.760
Well now, um, for virtual console, the letter is included in the digital manual and it has

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:06.080
an image of the letter and a bucket of water at the bottom.

01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:10.200
So you click on the image and the letter dips into the bucket and the code shows up.

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:14.720
Um, on the European release though, it just has a click here, link at the bottom and the

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:15.720
thing will pop up.

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:19.280
But I think it's kind of neat that, you know, you dunk the virtual letter.

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.280
It's cute.

01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:21.280
It's cute.

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:22.280
Yeah.

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:23.280
I'm going to see if I can find a copy of it.

01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.280
I'll link it in the chat room.

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.280
But yeah.

01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.800
I was surprised they haven't remade that series yet.

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:30.000
I'm kind of surprised too.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.620
Like they did have a sequel to star tropics.

01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:33.320
I know like it was like soda's revenge.

01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.320
Wasn't soda's revenge.

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:39.560
Wasn't the last NES game they made or no, that was, it was right at the end though.

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:45.040
I think Wario's woods was technically the last NES game they ever made, but Zoda's revenge

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:46.040
was right at the end.

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:47.040
All right.

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.040
We've got the letter.

01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:49.040
Nice.

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:50.040
Oh, that's a bad image.

01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:53.400
Um, there we go.

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:56.920
And I am going to, um, put a link to that in the chat room.

01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.920
Yeah.

01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:58.920
It'd be fun.

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:02.480
If anyone wants to see, it's actually, and I love the name of the website, socks make

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:05.440
people sexy.net slash put on tumbler.

01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:06.440
Put on the tumbler.

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:07.440
Okay.

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.440
But I'm just gonna say it to you.

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:09.440
Okay.

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:11.160
images slash star tropics underscore letter dot JPEG.

01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:12.160
Good.

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.160
Check it out.

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:19.600
This guy looks like a Rob, the robot, by the way, this navcom guy in the, uh, little ship

01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:22.640
that you navigate just so you know, it's just like a Rob the robot.

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:23.640
All right.

01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:24.640
Anyhow, there it is.

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:26.720
Your classic game of the week star tropics.

01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:27.720
One of my favorites too.

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.840
Good, good, good call dark Sakura.

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:33.600
Even though that wasn't one that maybe you remember as fondly, that was, that was a classic

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:34.600
game for the rest of us.

01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:38.160
There are a few games I haven't played or haven't played a whole lot of, but that doesn't

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:41.160
mean that other people haven't, you know, played them.

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.160
There you go.

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.720
So, all right, we're going to take a quick break guys, but when we come back, there is

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:49.520
plenty more of orange launch radio to come, including some rapid fire news.

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:53.240
Uh, the FUs of the week in the mail back, of course, your Twitter topics is twitter.com

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:54.240
slash O L R.

01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:56.040
And of course more phone calls.

01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:05.680
When we get back with more of orange lounge radio.

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:08.240
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:15.120
We are live of course, with our 422nd episode on this July the 31st of 2011.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:17.840
All right, we're into part B of the show.

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:21.560
We're going to start off part B as we always do with some rapid fire news.

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.760
So Loki, start us off with some rapid fire news.

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:24.760
Ah, yes.

01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:26.600
Um, lots of fun stuff.

01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:31.480
Let's talk a little bit about rock band and of course, um, they hit a major milestone

01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:32.480
this week.

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:37.920
3000 tracks now on their service, both combined in the regular rock band store and of course

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:40.280
the rock band network stuff.

01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:49.640
Um, and to celebrate this, harmonix is actually hooking up, uh, 30 people, um, in America,

01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:55.280
um, with a hundred songs of their choosing either on Xbox or PS3.

01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:58.000
And of course then, you know, it's 3000 songs.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:04.440
There's different ways to enter, um, via Twitter, Facebook or the rock band forums.

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:09.720
And um, yeah, hopefully someone out there is going to enjoy those hundred songs if you

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:10.720
win.

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:18.320
Um, of course, as of us recording this, it ended about a few days ago, so, uh, so much

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.320
for that.

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:21.120
And then snooze, you lose.

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:27.280
I forgot to enter to, uh, of course, uh, you know, you don't win the hundred songs.

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.640
There are some other things coming out this week including, um, and these are all individual

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.640
songs.

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.640
They don't have any packs this week.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.960
Uh, make some noise by the beastie boys.

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:37.440
That's going to be two bucks.

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:38.680
No sleep to Brooklyn.

01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:44.840
Um, also two bucks and that's also from the beastie boys, um, brought a barracuda by heart.

01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:47.400
Uh, that's two bucks.

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.980
That's pretty awesome.

01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:52.360
Super bad parts one and two by James Brown.

01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:54.140
That's also two bucks.

01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:58.420
And tell me something good by Rufus featuring Chaka Khan.

01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:00.040
That's also two bucks.

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:06.440
And you can get some pro bass and pro guitar expansions for a barracuda and super bad parts

01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:08.280
one and two.

01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:09.280
Not time for that yet.

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:10.280
Sorry.

01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:13.360
Uh, yes.

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:18.480
It's funny because Duke Nukem still thinks it's popular, but Duke Nukem Forever is going

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:23.500
to be getting some new, uh, download content, new multiplayer modes and maps.

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:30.440
This fall, um, they're going to have a Hail to the Icons parody pack and it's going to

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:40.680
have several parodies of, um, different games including, um, they've got a parody of Team

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:43.920
Fortress 2, um, that's going to be in there.

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:51.360
Uh, two forts one bridge that's going to include hats and, you know, it says Duke doesn't need

01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:52.360
no stinking hats.

01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:56.520
Give him a minigun and he'll beat off all, um, corners.

01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:57.720
He'll beat off?

01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:58.720
Or all comers.

01:51:58.720 --> 01:51:59.720
Okay.

01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:00.720
Um, okay.

01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:03.800
Um, inferno time machine engage.

01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:10.560
Uh, Duke does combat in a hellish landscape of lava and teleporters who turn on the 16

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:11.680
bit graphics.

01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:14.800
More importantly, where did this DFG come from?

01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:19.960
Ha ha ha, you're parodying Doom, a game that's how old?

01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:24.920
Oh, as old as your last game, because that's how long it took to get it out.

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:25.920
Ha ha ha.

01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:31.160
Uh, sand pit, player's sake, roll of mini Duke in a giant sandbox with two bases on

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:33.360
either end made of child's toys.

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:36.360
This map features sticky grenades and Call of Duke.

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:40.080
Gee, I wonder what game that is parodying.

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:43.520
Duke engages in modern combat in a war-torn city.

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:49.160
Foes don't stand a chance against Duke when he spams them back with the noob tube.

01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:55.920
Okay, and they're also gonna have freeze tag, which I guess is gonna be, um, players will

01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:00.720
be able to freeze and shatter their opponents in huge succession for points and combos.

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:01.720
That's gonna be the new mode.

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:05.240
You know what the funny part about it, about all this?

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:08.480
All those games that you're parodying, way better than your own game.

01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:12.200
Ha ha ha, joke's on you, dumbass.

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.480
So that'll be coming, if you bought Duke Nukem.

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:20.080
Hey, you know what, by the time that all this download content comes out, I bet you the

01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:25.840
download content will be priced higher than the actual game, because it already got price

01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:26.840
dropped, by the way.

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:27.840
Did it really?

01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:29.560
$3,999 happened this week.

01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:30.560
Wow.

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:31.560
Yeah.

01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:32.560
That's a good sign.

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:36.480
You know, when you drop something really quick, that means it's selling well, right?

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:37.480
Right?

01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:38.480
Yeah.

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:50.280
Um, and, yeah, ha ha ha, Operation Rainfall apparently is still not working out too well.

01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:54.160
Xenoblade Chronicles is not coming out over here.

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:59.400
Of course, you know, this week, Nintendo released their upcoming software list, and Xenoblade

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:02.080
Chronicles, nowhere near to be found.

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:06.440
It is still scheduled for release in Europe, however, on August 19th, and of course, you

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:13.200
know, the game has been subject to ongoing campaigns by disgruntled American RPG fans,

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:16.560
and um, they're kinda pissed off that it's still not coming out over here.

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:20.640
Seen as it's being localized into languages that, you know, us Americans speak, so you

01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:23.800
would think it'd be easy to publish it.

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:24.800
But Nintendo doesn't care.

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:29.360
Why don't they just put it on their downloadable serv- ohhhh, that's right, they don't really

01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:31.400
have anything like that, yeah.

01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:34.800
I mean, they have the Wii store, but- I don't know if you saw it, they announced this week

01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:38.680
that guess what, they're gonna now start offering download content on the 3DS.

01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:40.080
I heard about that, yeah.

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:43.640
That's like, wow, way to the party.

01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.720
Well, I mean, didn't the Wii do that too?

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.960
I mean, the Wii had Rock Band, and you could download some stuff on there, so I don't think

01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:54.960
it's exactly earth-shattering to hear that Nintendo's supporting DLC, it's really just

01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:55.960
a matter of when.

01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:58.840
But it's just not coming out yet, I mean, it's like they haven't built the infrastructure

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:00.080
into the 3DS.

01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:02.640
There's no games worth it yet.

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:03.680
Wait.

01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:08.880
Now what would be interesting is Nintendo saying, we are getting on board with that.

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:10.240
That would truly be something new.

01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:12.200
That would be like Bizarro World.

01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:15.920
Now that is something- Mario Kart with new downloadable tracks?

01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:16.920
Exactly.

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.080
That is the story to wait for.

01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:19.720
Is that what Nintendo's talking about?

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:22.040
Because then that's news.

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:24.080
Anyhow.

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.680
Moving on to some other news.

01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:29.600
Street Fighter X Tekken is obviously on everybody's radar, especially if you're into fighting

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:30.600
games.

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:35.920
Fans of the characters, Dan, that might be Dark Sakura, she's a fan of Dan.

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:40.040
If you're a fan of Dan or a fan of Anna from Tekken, you might be disappointed.

01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:44.720
Both of them have been announced as not in the roster, in fact they were booted out of

01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:45.720
the game.

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:50.880
The series producer Yoshinori Ono has said that those characters won't be in Street Fighter

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:57.480
X Tekken because he was killed by a Tekken character at Comic-Con last year.

01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:04.480
But I think the real reason is, quote, as much as I personally wanted to have a cool

01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:09.120
Nina and Anna tag battle, the director was against putting Anna because we already had

01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:10.120
Nina in.

01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:13.760
Now, of course, Dan probably isn't gone for real real.

01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:19.160
I would, at this point, knowing Capcom, wait for Street Fighter X Tekken Super or whatever.

01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:24.600
Honestly, I think Anna's gonna be a palette swap for Nina.

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:26.360
Which is what she's been in other games.

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:29.840
Anna kind of played differently though, I loved Anna because she had her big heels and

01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:31.160
everything, it was kind of fun.

01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:33.200
Nina had the heels going on too, she had the big boots.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:34.720
I know, it was just different with Anna.

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:35.720
It's hard to explain.

01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:39.480
Well, Anna had the dress and was super girly with the short hair.

01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:42.160
Yes, fun to play.

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:43.760
My old boss kind of looked like Anna.

01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:44.760
Oh well, anyway.

01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:50.440
There you go, so those characters will not be in Street Fighter X Tekken, sadly.

01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:54.480
Some soundtrack related news, quite a bit of it actually, there's a write in music collection

01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.700
that's due out on September 28th.

01:56:56.700 --> 01:57:00.480
It's Team Entertainment is the record label, a four-disc compilation of music from the

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.680
write in series called The Lightning Strikes Back.

01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:08.760
It will have music from write in the arcade from the 90s, write in 2, write in DX, write

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:12.960
in DX PlayStation, write in 3, and write in 4.

01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:15.180
Coming out September 28th in Japan.

01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:21.840
Also in soundtrack news, The King of Fighters XIII, the pre-orders will come with 15 years

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.840
of musical history, a four CD soundtrack compilation.

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.760
That's what Atlas is putting out there.

01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:30.880
Try and get folks to pre-order The King of Fighters XIII.

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.640
That's pretty cool, actually.

01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:37.200
There's also supposed to be some exclusive game modes in the console version of the game.

01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:42.280
A story mode that will have new visuals and animations, a practice mode, a tutorial mode,

01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:45.500
and other stuff that wasn't in the arcade but you would expect to see in a console release

01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:46.680
of a fighter.

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:53.680
One other soundtrack news, Rhythm Heaven on the Wii is getting a four-disc soundtrack.

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:59.000
It's already out in Japan, Rhythm Heaven Wii, but it's coming out here as well.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.160
So there you go.

01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:09.200
A four-disc CD soundtrack coming out in Japan, August 24th for 4,800 yen, 150 songs.

01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:11.520
Perfect in extended tracks included.

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:16.580
Lastly, on the plate tonight, not in soundtrack news but in sequel rumor news, TimeSplitters

01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:19.880
4 rumored that there is a version of that coming.

01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:24.840
I guess this is because of the official PlayStation Magazine UK's rumor machine section.

01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.880
There's a rumor that says, quote, Gun-wielding monkeys are finally making a comeback.

01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:31.680
A fourth TimeSplitters title is to be announced soon.

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:36.560
Of course, it is coming from the rumors, but when you consider it's the official PlayStation

01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:37.560
Magazine.

01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:38.560
I love me some TimeSplitters.

01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:39.560
I know.

01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:40.560
I bet you're excited about that.

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:41.560
So, we will see.

01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:42.560
Are you giddy?

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:47.160
Uh, not until they actually announce something, because they've been talking new TimeSplitters

01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:48.640
for a long time now.

01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:52.520
All right, let's go to Dark Sakura.

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.860
In other news, we have the Endermen.

01:58:54.860 --> 01:58:55.860
They're coming for you.

01:58:55.860 --> 01:59:01.240
They're actually a new Minecraft mob, and they're just little black stick figures with

01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:02.240
white eyes.

01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:03.240
Like everything in Minecraft.

01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:06.120
You know, but they're all black.

01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:11.320
They actually remind me of, okay, do you ever remember in Mario Galaxy where there were

01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:16.280
the little black guys that were standing on top of the world but you couldn't get to them

01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:18.280
and they would just watch you?

01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:21.200
That's what they look like to me.

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:23.760
And they're just there to be scary.

01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.480
They're there to terrify you.

01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:29.700
So that's all they're there for, and they're going to be in the next Minecraft update.

01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:36.840
It's based off of, I guess, a character that was made on the Something Awful forums, Slenderman.

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:43.840
I watched, they have this ARG, it's called Marvel something, I forget what it's called.

01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:46.880
And really creepy.

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:50.000
Really, really creepy.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.200
The Slenderman's also been thrown in a number of other video games too, just in background

01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:56.200
stuff.

01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:57.200
Very creepy.

01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:01.960
They'll basically stand still moving blocks around stuff, but if you move your reticle

02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:08.160
over them, they'll stare at you and then they'll charge at you.

02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:12.880
They can teleport and kill you.

02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:17.160
I'm actually going to get a picture in the chatroom so they can see what it looks like.

02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:18.720
There you go.

02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:23.160
So moving forward, we also have something from Disney.

02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:31.380
They want to buy UTV Ignition for $454 million.

02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:37.080
Their base, this actually comes from develop, and it says Disney already owns 50.4% of UTV

02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:42.040
and they're wanting to acquire the whole thing for its Bollywood films and TV shows.

02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:47.000
So who knows, but they own Ignition, so that means there might be some issues.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:52.880
And last but never least, and related to Disney a bit, Toy Story download content is coming

02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:54.740
for LittleBigPlanet 2.

02:00:54.740 --> 02:01:03.360
There will be, actually it's going to be on August 3rd in the UK, that's going to be £4.79

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:11.440
or €5.99, and that's nine Toy Story themed levels with two cut scenes, five levels and

02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:17.880
two mini levels, two new music tracks, one new interactive music track, one new level

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:22.320
background, five materials, ten decorations, six objects, and 149 stickers.

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:23.320
That's pretty rad.

02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:28.920
The costume pack, which is going to cost the same, has Buzz Lightyear gloves, helmet, legs,

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:30.520
teeth, and body.

02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:37.880
Then there's Slinky Dog set, which has the feet, ears, hands, nose, skin, body, and tail.

02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:43.720
There's Ham, which is a head, skin, and body, and Rex, which is the claws, head, skin, and

02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:44.960
body.

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:53.240
And then you can also, though, download each set individually for £1.59 or €1.99.

02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.600
Alright, I still got to get LittleBigPlanet 2.

02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.120
I don't know why I keep missing the boat on that one.

02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:01.680
I guess I keep waiting for a price cut that doesn't seem to be coming, but hopefully there'll

02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:05.520
be like a Game of the Year edition or something this holiday like there was the first time.

02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:06.520
So we'll see.

02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:10.720
Anyhow, before I get back into some more news, I want to mention a couple things real quick,

02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:13.360
kind of a second wave of housekeeping, if you will.

02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:17.240
First off, if you enjoy Orange Lawns Radio, do check out another show that we produce

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.240
here.

02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:21.360
It's called The Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth at www.hoardhouse.com.

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:25.800
It's myself and my buddy Xtfer, and this week we had special guest Ferrari, one of the guild

02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:30.960
leaders for Xtfer's Guild, on Talking Smack About WoW, some really good Firelands and

02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:32.160
raiding discussion this week.

02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:35.240
So if you're a fan of WoW, check that out again, hoardhouse.com.

02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:36.320
One more day.

02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:37.320
What's one more day?

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:39.040
Oh, you get your last Firelands vendor, right?

02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:40.040
I know.

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:41.040
You know you get a new mount from that.

02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:42.040
I know!

02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:43.040
You get like a little firebird thing.

02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:44.040
I know!

02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:45.040
SlaciousPop got that the other day.

02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:46.040
I know, I know, I know, I know.

02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:47.040
It's cute.

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:48.280
You'll be getting to ride a flaming bird.

02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:49.280
I know.

02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:50.280
Alright.

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:56.080
Also, the third podcast is probably delayed a little bit considering there's some personal

02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:01.240
stuff going on and so forth, but we are still eyeing that at least by Labor Day, no later

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:02.240
than that.

02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:04.960
We've already got things definitely in motion.

02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:07.200
Yeah, so more hints coming.

02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:10.660
Some of you have been begging me on Twitter for more information about that, so all I

02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:15.800
will say is that, you know, certain components of this show, if you like it, you're gonna

02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:18.120
really like the new show.

02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:21.560
Otherwise, oh well, you still got this show.

02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:23.560
It's all free, so don't complain.

02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:24.560
Alright.

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:25.560
The other thing...

02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:26.560
And they might learn a thing or two.

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:27.560
That's right.

02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:28.560
You might.

02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:34.000
Also, I want to say this, a new segment coming to OLR, actually.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.320
You know how we have like some segments we like to do on the show?

02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:38.760
Obviously, a lot of things you're very used to.

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:42.640
The Twitter topics, the Skype line we do at the end of the show, Classic Game of the Week

02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:44.000
and so forth.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:47.960
We've kind of talked amongst ourselves, you know, we like to mix it up once in a while

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:48.960
at OLR.

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:52.360
While we have a formula that works for us, once in a while we want to mix it up.

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:57.320
And one thing we want to feature more on the program is Indie Games.

02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:59.520
So we're gonna have a new segment starting soon.

02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:00.640
I can't say exactly when.

02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:03.980
It just depends when I can get some folks on the show, but we're actually gonna spotlight

02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:04.980
Indie Games.

02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:09.000
We don't have a name for the segment yet, but we are gonna have, or I guess I should

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:14.760
say, invite developers onto the show to talk about their passion, their game and, you know,

02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:17.040
share our space with the indie developers.

02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:21.660
We've had some on in the past in more full interview capacity, but we decided we wanted

02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:25.080
to have it be something that's a little more regular here on the show.

02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:29.040
After all, we are an independent podcast, so we should do more supportive Indie Games.

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:32.280
You know, I like to think we give them a fair share and a fair shout out here on the show,

02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.080
but I like to regularly feature something on the show, especially with so much that

02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:40.660
you can drown in on Xbox Live, Indie Arcade and the fact that they don't really do anything

02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:42.760
to call any of the notable releases to the top.

02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:47.640
I think it'd be really nice to have something to at least call out one game you should be

02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:48.760
checking out a week.

02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:51.760
I want to point out, it won't just be limited to Xbox.

02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:57.720
We're considering PC, Homebrew, as well as the iOS and iPhone and really Android and

02:04:57.720 --> 02:04:59.200
indie type of phone games.

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:03.080
Pretty much any system that's easily accessible will cover it.

02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:07.340
Hell, if somebody who's developing a new Dreamcast game wants to come on the show, I am all for

02:05:07.340 --> 02:05:10.640
that, and I'm sure Dark Sakura's all over that too, because the fangirl she is.

02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:15.400
So if you are a developer that wants to have your Indie Game featured on the show, I would

02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:19.720
like to keep it to relatively new releases, but in the beginning I won't be too picky.

02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:23.680
But something that's been out in the past few months or so, do drop me an email.

02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:29.240
You can email me personally, rob at orangeloungeradio.com, or you can always drop the general email bag

02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:30.240
as well.

02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:33.080
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com will get you in touch with who you need to get in touch

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:34.080
with.

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.480
So that is coming to the show soon.

02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:38.640
Whenever we get enough stuff in the pipeline where we have some things to feature, we're

02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:40.400
going to spotlight that here in the show.

02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:41.600
I'm excited.

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:44.880
Just think about it like the classic game of the week, but now it's going to be the

02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:45.880
Indie game of the week.

02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:46.880
The new classics.

02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:51.080
I guess you can think about it that way, and it won't just be Dark Sakura telling you about

02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:53.840
it, we want to have a discussion with the developer.

02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:57.140
Although if a week goes by where maybe we're having a hard time getting somebody, we'll

02:05:57.140 --> 02:05:59.080
talk about something that caught our eye.

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:03.440
Speaking of iOS, I want to talk about that real quick, and some of the iPhone games.

02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:06.680
Because there's some really good stuff going on on the iPhone right now, like Groove Coaster.

02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:07.680
Right?

02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:08.680
Amazing.

02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:09.680
We all agree.

02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:10.680
We all agree.

02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:11.680
I love Tiny Tower.

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:12.680
Okay, look.

02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:13.680
Do you see this, Rob?

02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:14.680
What?

02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:15.680
You're downloading it now?

02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:16.680
I will download Tiny Tower.

02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:17.680
Here's the thing.

02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:18.680
Tiny Tower.

02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:19.680
Oh my God.

02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:20.680
I should hate it.

02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:23.760
It's no better than a Facebook game, but it's so adorable, and all the characters are little

02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:27.520
8-bit characters, and they look so cute, and they have their little bit books that they

02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:28.520
update.

02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:29.520
And you know what I really love about-

02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:30.520
There's one called Tiny Zoo.

02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:32.800
You know what I love about Tiny Tower?

02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:35.120
Let me tell you this about Tiny Tower.

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:42.080
What I love about it is that, yes, it's free-to-play, and they have these whole tower bucks things,

02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:46.800
and if you want to buy the tower bucks, you can do that and move the game a lot faster.

02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:51.880
But you don't have to, because once in a while, and more so than in most free-to-play games,

02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:55.960
you'll get tipped a tower buck, or you'll get tower bucks as little incentive rewards.

02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:58.800
And so it helps to move the game along a little bit.

02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:02.960
And what I also love about it is that if you forget to check your tower for three weeks,

02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:06.680
oh well, the lights were dark for three weeks, and you didn't make any money.

02:07:06.680 --> 02:07:08.520
Your citizens don't move out.

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:10.960
They don't burn the building down in protest.

02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:14.960
It's just, it doesn't require your tender love and care all the time.

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.360
So if you want to play it every day, you can.

02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:18.360
If you want to play it once a week, you can.

02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:23.320
That is good design, in my opinion, and where the freemium model should go.

02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:26.040
And I do know people that have spent money on Tiny Tower.

02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:30.140
I wouldn't, but I think if people want to, they can.

02:07:30.140 --> 02:07:31.140
So there you go.

02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:35.320
So, all right, so I'm looking at our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchy.com, and it does look

02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:41.060
like some folks in chat are excited about the whole indie games, talking about that

02:07:41.060 --> 02:07:42.160
segment coming up.

02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:46.960
And Act Deaf there says, woo, new OLR segment.

02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:51.280
Break Man in chat says, how will any of you ever have the time to actually play games

02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:53.040
talking about the third podcast?

02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:54.040
I will say this much.

02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:55.040
Hey, I'm not working.

02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:56.040
I am.

02:07:56.040 --> 02:08:00.000
And yeah, adding a third podcast to the plate is going to be something.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.960
It's not going to be a long show, and it's going to be something where we can record

02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:07.720
several of them in a day, and produce it regularly.

02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:08.720
I'm not going to lie.

02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:10.080
That's the way it's going to be done.

02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:12.080
But I think you guys will get a kick out of it.

02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:15.160
It is going to be myself, DarkSakura, and Dan.

02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:18.680
Loki is, of course, always welcome whenever he wants to come on, but he's got other stuff

02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:19.800
he's got to do, too.

02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:22.560
And Dan, of course, is going to add a whole new element, especially when we tell you more

02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:24.360
about what it's about.

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:29.480
It'll be great.

02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:30.480
Let's see.

02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:31.480
Let's see.

02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:34.240
Breakman in the chat says, Xbox Live Indie Games.

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:36.040
Those devs need to call OLR.

02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:37.040
I agree.

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:40.120
So, please, again, get in touch with me, Rob at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:43.160
Who wants to be first?

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:44.160
And let's see.

02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:47.280
Misty about Tiny Tower in chat says, hey, protest burning might be funny.

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:48.280
Once anyway, at least.

02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:51.840
I do agree it would be nice to see them do a little more with some of the events and

02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:55.840
so forth, but the game is still early in its life, and I'm sure there'll be update patches

02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:56.840
and so forth.

02:08:56.840 --> 02:08:58.560
Now, that's iOS gaming done well.

02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:03.560
I'm going to tell you what iOS game blows, absolutely blows.

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.360
Capcom Arcade.

02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:06.440
You check this out?

02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:14.120
Capcom Arcade, you can play classic Capcom Arcade games like 1942 and, I don't know,

02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:18.860
what else is in the, Ghosts and Goblins and Street Fighter and all that.

02:09:18.860 --> 02:09:24.080
You can play those, and the deal is you can play like three games once for free.

02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:28.320
You get like three tokens every day for free, but if you want more tokens, you have to pay

02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:32.280
more, or you can buy a machine permanently for like three bucks, but it controls like

02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:33.280
shit.

02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:37.320
And I'll tell you what, Magic Sword came out this week, and I love Magic Sword.

02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:41.160
That's like the best, like, Capcom 90s game for me.

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.600
I loved Magic Sword.

02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:46.760
Yes, I love the one on Xbox and PlayStation Network, by the way, the whole remake, but

02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:50.960
I love me some Magic Sword, and I was so excited when it came out to the phone that I played

02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:51.960
it.

02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:53.360
It controls like shit.

02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:59.480
I cannot use, like, I hate the emulation of a thumb stick with the, it just doesn't work,

02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:03.480
and then the game froze up on me halfway through the first stage, completely froze up on me,

02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:07.160
and I was like, the music kept going, so I knew that the emulation was still running,

02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:12.440
but the game itself just froze, and I was like, did anybody fucking test this, or did

02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:15.880
they just decide to just put this shit out and see who'd buy it, because it seemed to

02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:21.240
me like option B. So, yet another strike from Capcom this week.

02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:24.280
That Capcom arcade needs to be tested better.

02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:26.280
It sucks.

02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:28.280
Anyhow.

02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:31.000
So there you go, that's my iOS talk.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.280
Let's get back into some other news.

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:36.600
So we'll do some long news with Loki.

02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:37.600
Yes.

02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:44.720
You know, and since we were, we were talking a little bit about Capcom, and they made an

02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:50.200
errant judgment, if you will, back with Resident Evil Mercenaries, where they said, hey, you

02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:55.280
know what, we're gonna make it impossible for you to erase your game's save, and everybody

02:10:55.280 --> 02:11:00.040
was pissed, and hopefully we figured that maybe people learned by that, you know, that

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:01.040
lesson.

02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:03.320
Well, no.

02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:09.360
Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions from Namco also features a problem where your save files are

02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:12.800
permanent and unable to be reset or erased.

02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:20.640
Of course, they put this out, and you know, there's, you know, according to Game Life

02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:26.080
blog, Wired's Game Life blog, there's simply no way to erase a save once it's been written

02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:27.080
to the cartridge.

02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:30.640
I've looked all over, even going as far as to ask a Namco Bandai representative, and

02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:33.720
it doesn't seem like there's a way to erase a save game.

02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:39.280
And you know, basically saying that the design doesn't just affect earned in-game awards,

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:43.800
which can't be deleted, but also high scores, meaning that the most recent high score is

02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:48.840
the only one that the game records.

02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:55.080
Apparently though, Namco, they have come to an explanation for it, and they're saying

02:11:55.080 --> 02:12:01.200
that, here's how it works.

02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:08.720
Pac-Man Tilt, it says the plus high score from the EX level one, it says it needs to

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:14.440
open 10 mils, let me really see what the high scores are here.

02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:19.400
Score ranking, keeps one of each of the top scores mentioned above to submit to online

02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:25.040
ranking boards, keeps the gamer's name in which the player can input via on-screen keyboard.

02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:33.040
Yeah, it doesn't really say why they did that, it just shows how it's affected.

02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:38.080
It says they confirmed that players have the option to share high scores online, but using

02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:44.300
the same cartridge in different DS main posts to score twice, Namco Bandai didn't comment

02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:48.520
on the decision-making process behind it.

02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:53.920
Sounds like no decision was made, it sounds like just bad design again.

02:12:53.920 --> 02:13:02.040
Yeah, other than, but if they were to copy Capcom's response, it would say that it was

02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:10.280
an attempt to preserve the game's arcade style feel, and it would never do it again.

02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:16.880
Here's my thing, the 3DS, okay, you've got very little penetration for the 3DS out there

02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:26.000
right now, do you really need to hinder sales of any game on that system, and Pac-Man and

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:30.280
Galaga Dimensions, I don't know about you, but that's not really at the top of my list

02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:32.120
of games I would want for the 3DS.

02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:34.840
Well, they're great on Xbox Live Arcade, and it sounds like that's where they're going

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:37.080
to remain great, you know?

02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:41.480
Yeah, but it's just like, really, you thought that was a good idea.

02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:47.220
The thing that concerns me here, I mean, another, and I would say, I might have been interested

02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:50.640
in these games if the price was right, but again, this whole save file thing, I can't

02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:55.760
support this, and I don't, like, the excuse they're giving just fucking doesn't make sense.

02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:57.840
They didn't really talk in us in circles.

02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:59.320
No, they didn't really have an excuse.

02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:01.000
There is, they gave no excuse.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:08.080
This concerns me, because we have two companies that have made the same mistake that's very

02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:12.680
fishy, and that's the whole used game market, right?

02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:17.800
So it's, it's really fishy to me that we have two companies that have now done this.

02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:19.800
You do understand people, like, I, I don't...

02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:20.800
Is this a trend?

02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:26.280
This isn't, this isn't gonna stop you, I mean, yeah, it will stop used game sales.

02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:29.080
You know how it's gonna stop used game sales, or at least hinder it?

02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:33.040
Because people, exactly, because people aren't gonna buy the new game, because if you're

02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:38.440
gonna buy a game, which, you know, games stop me, decide, hey, you know what, we're not

02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:41.680
gonna take it back because you can't erase this save game, granted, they haven't made

02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:46.120
the decision permanently so far, they did at one time with Resident Evil, where they

02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:50.180
said, oh, we're not gonna take it back, and then they changed that, but, you know, if,

02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:55.480
if they do this, then, you know, a consumer that realizes, you know what, I'm gonna play

02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:59.320
this game for a while, then I'm probably gonna get sick of it, and I'm gonna sell it, and

02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:04.520
get some money for something else, if they can't sell it back, they may not buy it.

02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:08.200
They're, you know what, I'll just, I'll just skip buying, and I'll, I'll wait until another

02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:10.160
game comes out.

02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:17.560
It's just, it's dumb, it's really a dumb idea, and it's, and why you should be limited, why

02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:22.840
even at all games should be saved to the carts that they're on instead of your system.

02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:28.480
Your 3DS, which has a goddamn SD card in it, every one comes with one.

02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:31.880
Yeah, it's not even something you have to buy separately, like on most DSPs.

02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:38.040
And you can save to that, I don't understand why you can't do that, and that's stupid.

02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:43.220
You know, with the DS it made sense, because there was, there was no saving whatsoever

02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:50.100
to the system, there was no storage of any sort whatsoever, but this is the 3DS.

02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:56.520
Come on, jump into the century where, you know what, we can store data to these carts.

02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:01.960
I mean, it's not like Namco could have heard what Capcom did and then made the decision.

02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:06.640
Both of these companies made this conscious decision to design the saves this way months

02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:09.520
ago, and that is weird to me.

02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:12.880
It's almost like somebody put them up to it.

02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:15.480
That's what strikes me as, like, just really weird.

02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:17.800
But anyway, I hope this trend stops.

02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:22.360
And yet again, another game, but this one, unlike the Capcom game, this was one I was

02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:26.720
legitimately like, oh, I really do love Pac-Man Championship Edition, I wouldn't mind a portable

02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:29.680
version of it, you know, if it was like 1999 maybe.

02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:34.720
But now, nope, not gonna do it, because I'm not gonna support this type of game design.

02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:40.040
So, even though I do tend to buy most of my games new, and I don't sell a lot of them

02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:41.800
back, very rarely do I sell games back.

02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:46.760
The last game I remember distinctly selling back was Top Spin 3.

02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:52.800
And just a handful of, like, GameCube and old first generation Xbox 360 games.

02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:53.800
So.

02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:58.920
Anyhow, more news about the Xbox 360 anyway, since I brought it up there.

02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:04.440
Free-to-play games apparently are inevitable on the Xbox 360, at least according to one

02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:05.440
publisher.

02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:11.080
Todd Harris of Hi-Rez Studios, who makes the game Tribes Ascend, it's a multiplayer first

02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:15.680
person shooter coming to the PC, and hopefully someday the 360.

02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:19.640
Todd Harris says, quote, at least from our conversations, both Sony and Microsoft are

02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:23.320
moving there strategically, but there are still some things to be worked out on both

02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:29.400
the business side and the technical side of the certification side, that's a tongue twister,

02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:31.880
regarding frequency of patches.

02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:35.680
And those issues just need further advancement before we would be comfortable putting a release

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:37.580
timeframe on the console version.

02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:41.560
It's not the case of never, but we know all those things we can handle on the PC, so that's

02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:43.120
why PC is first.

02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:44.120
Interesting.

02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:47.280
I remember hearing something about this, doesn't Microsoft limit you to the number of patches

02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:49.440
you're able to do within the release?

02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:51.680
I think so, I think you have to pay for that or something.

02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:59.040
And maybe that's why the free-to-play games, well hell, any MMO tends to do a lot of frequent

02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:03.160
updates, maybe that's the reservation they're having, which makes a lot of sense now.

02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:08.040
To me, it's nice to kind of hear what the holdup is, and that makes sense now.

02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:13.000
Although, shit, Final Fantasy XI, man, that game ended up being the exception to every

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:18.600
damn rule, because that game can patch whenever they want, because it runs through play online.

02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:20.480
I found a copy at the thrift store today.

02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:21.480
Did you really?

02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:24.600
Like, the three release one.

02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:27.120
Well, that's kind of dumb, because the code isn't going to work.

02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:29.120
I know, but I thought it was funny.

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:30.400
Yeah, it is kind of funny.

02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:31.400
And Half-Life 2.

02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:33.480
That poor thrift store didn't know any better.

02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:34.480
Yeah.

02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:36.360
If someone's going to buy it and not know any better.

02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:38.280
I know, that's the sad part.

02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:42.880
Alright, and Brakeman comments in our chatroom at chat.orns.com, Xbox has already had

02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:45.760
free-to-play games, 1 versus 100.

02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:46.760
Too bad it didn't last.

02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:47.760
Good point.

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:52.760
1 versus 100 wasn't an MMO, per se, but it was a free-to-play game, sure, it was Microsoft

02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:57.580
backed, for one, but everybody, well, at least a lot of people I know miss it dearly.

02:18:57.580 --> 02:18:59.280
It's not a freemium game, though.

02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:00.280
True.

02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:04.400
But you know, though, that Marvel's MMO is going to be free-to-play.

02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:05.400
That's right, I remember hearing that.

02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:06.400
With Deadpool.

02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:07.400
But it's not going to be on 360.

02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:08.400
No.

02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:09.400
It's going to be a PC game.

02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:10.400
Yeah, but still.

02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:11.400
Yeah.

02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:13.880
So, let's go to the mailbag.

02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:19.200
Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read your emails.

02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:20.200
Live here on air.

02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:24.920
Actually, I've got to say this, live, this is really funny, just live, we had a little

02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:30.640
net split live, and if you've ever been on IRC, you know what a net split is, and I guess

02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:35.380
Loki's on one side of the net split and I'm on another, because I could see that Loki

02:19:35.380 --> 02:19:37.720
just left the room.

02:19:37.720 --> 02:19:39.960
It's me on an island with Black Wolf and Dark Tetsuya.

02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:41.520
Oh, and everybody's back.

02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:42.520
Oh, just reconnected.

02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:43.520
There you go.

02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:44.520
That's kind of funny.

02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:45.520
All right.

02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:46.520
Oh, internets.

02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:47.520
You never cease to amaze me.

02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:48.520
All right, let's move on.

02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:49.520
Mailbag.

02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:50.520
Open shop time.

02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:51.520
Oh.

02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:52.520
Oh yeah, mailbag that thing.

02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:53.520
Well, we got two.

02:19:53.520 --> 02:19:54.520
I'm going to double check and see if we got any more, real quick.

02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:55.520
Nope, just two.

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:56.520
So, the first one.

02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:57.520
Hey, guys.

02:19:57.520 --> 02:19:58.520
Hey.

02:19:58.520 --> 02:19:59.520
Just wondering, do you know of any smaller Xbox controllers?

02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:00.520
The current ones are so big, and the way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons

02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:01.520
are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way the

02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:23.200
buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the

02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:31.260
way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way

02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:35.820
have to probably get a third-party controller and I think most of those are pretty soon.

02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:40.700
Or a joystick. You could try one of those game pads like they put some out for Street Fighter 4,

02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:45.340
the little game pads that came out, but I know Salacious Pop had a lot of problems with those.

02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:51.660
Like he got one, he ordered it brand new out of the bag, broken. What about like, I mean,

02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:55.740
I know she might be thinking smaller, but what about thinking bigger? Like what about an arcade

02:20:55.740 --> 02:21:01.660
stick? That's what my suggestion was. I have, I've had hand surgery twice on my right hand, so it

02:21:01.660 --> 02:21:05.900
gets really stiff really easily and my fingers will lock up because I still need to have one

02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:13.180
other finger worked on. But, um, like for example, I can play Dragon Age 2 just fine because I use

02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:16.540
my thumb and forefinger for a lot of stuff and neither of those are ones that have problems,

02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:21.500
but I cannot play fighting games very well because I'm moving so fast and my hand will

02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:27.340
start cramping up. So what I found is that using the joystick, you know, like we have the tournament

02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:33.260
stick and we've got the Xbox joystick, which you can probably find at a used game store somewhere

02:21:33.260 --> 02:21:41.340
for cheap. Um, I have no problem. So something like that will work. A situation like that is

02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:45.180
tough too, because you really need to get your, no pun intended, you need to get your hands on

02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:49.420
a controller to actually try it before you buy it. So I would really suggest you head out to

02:21:49.420 --> 02:21:54.140
something where they tend to have those things out for you to try, like maybe Best Buy. Uh, I know

02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:58.220
Fry's, but they're more west coast. Fry's always seems to have that kind of stuff out, at least the

02:21:58.220 --> 02:22:02.460
arcade sticks, but I know they don't have those everywhere. Um, hopefully there's a store near

02:22:02.460 --> 02:22:06.300
you. Maybe even an independent store might be a way to go where they would have some of that stuff

02:22:06.300 --> 02:22:11.500
out for you to try it and see how your hand takes to that. By the way, speaking of the controllers

02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:16.700
they have out at Fry's, they have a six button PlayStation controller that's not, it's, it's

02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:23.900
third party but supported by PlayStation, by Sony that's super comfortable. So I mean, maybe see how

02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:29.500
that likes it and see if the same distributor makes another pad like it, because I found that

02:22:29.500 --> 02:22:34.140
to be really comfortable and it was just a six button fighting stick. I was playing, um, Super

02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:40.860
Street Fighter IV with it at Fry's. Interesting. Yeah. So that was that email. And then the last

02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:48.060
one, just two quick unrelated questions. Um, first off, is there an online multiplayer game that

02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:55.180
varies the audio of voice chat or availability of text chat based on proximity? A character closer

02:22:55.180 --> 02:23:00.620
to you would sound louder while players across the map couldn't be heard at all. I haven't gotten my

02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:04.460
feet wet with it, but I suggest World of Warcraft would do something like this. Actually it does.

02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:08.860
It does not, and the voice chat that's built into WoW kind of has a reputation for sucking.

02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:12.780
They tried to build it so that people wouldn't have to get what's called ventrilo servers or

02:23:12.780 --> 02:23:18.220
TeamSpeak some people use. Um, but folks tend to rely on the ventrilo servers. With characters

02:23:18.220 --> 02:23:25.980
though? Actually your proximity does change with in-game, with NPCs. Yeah. But if your sound

02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:29.980
drivers will support it. Right. But not other people. I think he's thinking like a person to

02:23:29.980 --> 02:23:33.660
person game. You know what game comes to mind for me, to me for some reason is Halo. Didn't

02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:39.740
Halo do that? Or specifically Halo 2 and 3 character. He's not saying, Oh, he said a

02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:47.740
character. Yeah. Wow. Does that then? Yeah. Wow. Does that, um, wow. We'll also pan left to right,

02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:58.860
depending on your sound card. Yeah. Um, I know that area noises in portal two and also the

02:23:58.860 --> 02:24:04.140
loudspeaker in portal two based on where you are. The, um, the loudspeaker will project a

02:24:04.140 --> 02:24:07.820
different way depending on the texture of the walls and where you are. Do you remember that?

02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:16.300
So the echo will be different. Um, yeah. And when you're talking to, I don't care spoilers,

02:24:16.300 --> 02:24:22.060
it's been out already. When you're talking to potatoes through the glass wall, um, she's a

02:24:22.060 --> 02:24:26.780
little quieter than when you're actually right in front of her. So a lot more games are doing that,

02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:30.620
but really a lot of it also has to do with your, with your sound card and, you know,

02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:35.260
playing stereo versus mono. So, and then the second question real quick tiger call on our

02:24:35.260 --> 02:24:39.420
chairman says they still use ventrilo ventrilo harassment comes to mind. Yeah. I've seen those

02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:45.100
YouTube's interesting for the record on Star Trek online, which by the way also does the distance

02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:52.300
based. Um, I use team speak and do any of that. It's just like ventrilo. Yeah. They're just

02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:56.620
competing clients, but yeah. Oh yeah. Ventrilo is used by a lot of wow people. A lot of guilds

02:24:56.620 --> 02:25:03.740
use ventrilo. It's really common. Any MMO with a big guild that does any type of group events,

02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:08.540
you're going to find something like ventrilo team speak. One of those clients. I actually host a

02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:12.700
ventrilo server for my private guild of friends for the record. I do prefer ventrilo versus team

02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:19.820
speak. Me too. After having used them both. And I used team speak since February when I was playing,

02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:24.620
um, February last year when I was playing Star Trek online. Okay. The second question, secondly,

02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:31.340
assuming Jamie is on tonight's show, what tense is used in phrases such as will have happened?

02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:37.980
And I do believe that is future perfect. Will have happened. When you're referring to anything

02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:46.140
that will, that is a future event happening, but in that future point where it has already happened,

02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:51.980
it's future perfect. Really? I thought we were a video game show. He asked. Fair enough. Um,

02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:58.780
and that's from Robert M. Add it for the emails then. Yeah. If you want to get in on the email

02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:04.140
bag, mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com. But now's the part of the show where we could rant

02:26:04.140 --> 02:26:14.700
about lack of emails. If we would like. See you at the week.

02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:26.380
Um, you know, I did have one at the beginning of the show and now for the life of me,

02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:33.340
I can't remember what it is. So fuck you do not remember. You know, the memory is the first thing

02:26:33.340 --> 02:26:46.300
you know. Hey Rob, what Loki, um, fuck you. The whole foods being too damn expensive.

02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:51.500
Go to sunflower instead, all the same stuff and it's cheaper. There's some big cheese wheels that

02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:59.500
I really wanted to buy. They're probably like $300. I like me my parm. Um, I don't really have

02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:04.300
a whole lot of FUs. Things are, these are pretty good. Otherwise, um, FU to weekends not being

02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:08.940
three days long. I'll do something a little silly like that. That's it for the FUs of the week.

02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:14.380
Let's get back into some news. Loki. I'm not able to say that FU.

02:27:16.540 --> 02:27:22.140
I get a three day weekend this weekend. Anyways, uh, let's talk. Let's talk about some more,

02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:30.140
more, more, uh, retarded DRM. And you know, I'm saying that because it's Ubisoft and Ubisoft,

02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:35.740
you would have thought, learned their lesson with, uh, the always on, uh, DRM that they had

02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:41.820
with Assassin's Creed and stuff, but no, they're back with the always on Assassin's Creed type DRM

02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:49.580
for Driver San Francisco. Um, yes, the PC version will require a permanent internet connection and,

02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:56.700
um, no word if that's going to be loosened or not like it was with Assassin's Creed. Um, or I

02:27:56.700 --> 02:28:01.900
believe Prince of Persia was the other game that used that. Um, of course the console version has

02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:07.500
the stupid Uplay Passport now, the one time use code that will unlock multiplayer access. Thank

02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:14.140
you Ubisoft. I get to play unlock or I get to play some multiplayer. How generous of you. Also

02:28:14.140 --> 02:28:21.900
from dust is getting the Ubisoft DRM as well. Thanks Ubisoft. And, um, that kind of sucks.

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:29.900
Then, um, to kind of add a little bit of the icing on top of their stupid cake. Um,

02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:37.420
they have come out, they have come out and said that, guess what? Our always on DRM is a success.

02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:45.180
And it's a success and pissing everyone off. Yay. Basically it says, uh, Ubisoft has seen the clear

02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:51.180
reduction in piracy of our titles, which required a persistent online connection. And, uh, from that

02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:56.780
point of view, uh, the requirement is a success. That's because everyone went further underground

02:28:56.780 --> 02:29:01.260
to get around your DRM. I mean, they really think that people aren't going to find a way around it

02:29:01.260 --> 02:29:08.700
again. Here's the thing is, I don't know what exactly is considered a success because, yes,

02:29:08.700 --> 02:29:14.620
less people are pirating your game, but you know what? The number of people pirating your game

02:29:15.580 --> 02:29:19.900
before versus the number of people pirating your game now that you say it's reduced,

02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:25.180
does that actually equal out to more sales? Because that those two numbers are independent

02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:29.580
of each other. They have nothing to do with it. You know, whether people are interested in

02:29:29.580 --> 02:29:34.780
downloading your game or not, you know, um, someone may not have been interested in downloading

02:29:34.780 --> 02:29:40.460
Assassin's Creed 2 on PC or Splinter Cell Conviction on PC. Maybe they just didn't want

02:29:40.460 --> 02:29:48.540
to pirate the game. You ever think of that? Um, and not to mention though that, uh, the previous

02:29:48.540 --> 02:29:58.140
games, you know, the DRM was hacked within a few weeks anyways. So I wouldn't exactly go out and

02:29:58.140 --> 02:30:04.540
shout at the top, you know, your lungs that it's a, you know, great success because all you're

02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:08.700
really doing is affecting the people that legitimately buy the game and now they want to

02:30:08.700 --> 02:30:13.180
play it offline or something like that, you know, play it in an area. Say you take your laptop with

02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:17.660
you and you want to play it at, you know, a friend's house or something and you don't have open

02:30:17.660 --> 02:30:22.940
wi-fi. Or say you're a serviceman overseas serving our country and you want to play a game to relax

02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:32.700
on your break, you know. Can't do it. Can't do it. Thanks Ubisoft. So, yeah, it's stupid and...

02:30:32.700 --> 02:30:37.020
How is that a success? That's offensive. The only people that this hurts is the people who

02:30:37.020 --> 02:30:41.900
bought the game legitimately. That's who this hurts. Pirates will still get their game and

02:30:41.900 --> 02:30:48.140
you're an idiot if you don't think they won't. I mean, because the PSP is unhackable, right?

02:30:48.140 --> 02:30:55.580
Yeah. And, you know, I remember when they... It did get, you know, cracked almost, you know,

02:30:55.580 --> 02:31:02.540
pretty quickly. So, here's the thing. If you're using, and I'm gonna assume it's the same scheme

02:31:02.540 --> 02:31:10.380
as before, it's gonna be cracked even faster. So, all that's... Who's gonna win in that? The pirates.

02:31:10.380 --> 02:31:15.100
Because they don't have your crappy DRM anymore. What's this about? They denied the rumored cracks?

02:31:15.100 --> 02:31:21.820
Oh, this was back in March. They had, of course, their new DRM and I want to say it was for...

02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:27.020
I'm trying to remember which game it was. It wasn't... Maybe it was Assassin's Creed 2, but there was

02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:35.820
another game that they had coming out as well. I guess they... It says, pirated copies of various PC

02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:40.220
games from Ubisoft are apparently making the rounds online, sparking allegations that the DRM

02:31:40.220 --> 02:31:45.900
has already been defeated. And, of course, Ubisoft spokesman reported to Edge, saying this rumor is

02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:52.620
false and while pirated version may seem to be complete at startup, any gamer who downloads and

02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:57.820
plays the cracked version will find that the version is not complete. Yeah, not complete in the

02:31:57.820 --> 02:32:02.060
fact that you don't get... I don't know what it was that they didn't get access to, but it was

02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:06.700
something really stupid. Like, oh, you don't get... You don't get access to our wonderful customer

02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:13.100
service. You don't get the Uplay features. Hooray. Yeah, something like download content or something

02:32:13.100 --> 02:32:17.900
like that. Yeah, oh no, I can't download download content through your service. I guess I'll have to

02:32:17.900 --> 02:32:26.140
pirate that too. It'll be cracked. You watch. Because people love, especially now that they've

02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:32.860
come out and said, oh, it was a success. Whoosh! You just thrown gasoline on the fire, you dumbass.

02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:40.220
Alright, well, speaking of adding fuel to the fire, there's obviously a lot of pissed off people

02:32:40.220 --> 02:32:47.020
that Mega Man Legends 3 got cancelled. What does the internet love? Petitions! So, an activist group

02:32:47.020 --> 02:32:52.780
has called themselves 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3. They're trying to get

02:32:52.780 --> 02:32:58.940
100,000 members and they are trying to get them all on their Facebook page. So, you can go over

02:32:58.940 --> 02:33:04.220
there and like them if you are so inclined. Not exactly. They are doing that, but there's

02:33:05.180 --> 02:33:10.460
an actual official petition which you have to do is sign up for the Dev Room stuff for the Mega Man

02:33:10.460 --> 02:33:15.740
Legends 3 project and you sign up there and then you go to the forums and you make a comment and

02:33:15.740 --> 02:33:19.420
a thread. Well, it also wouldn't surprise me if people are just trying to reach out however they

02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:25.020
can. Yeah, it's basically that's how they're doing it right now. I signed up for it and did all that

02:33:25.020 --> 02:33:30.140
stuff just because, you know, I'd like to play Mega Man Legends 3 and, you know, I'm not going to

02:33:31.180 --> 02:33:35.420
beg them to release it, but I'll support the movement, I guess. Well, right now they're up

02:33:35.420 --> 02:33:42.380
to 36,428. So, they're about a third of the way there. So, we'll see what happens. So, I mean,

02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:47.340
no word on what happens when they hit 100,000. I mean, Capcom hasn't said. Capcom will go,

02:33:47.340 --> 02:33:53.580
thanks for your support. Capcom will say, wow, that's 100,000 people that aren't getting this

02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:59.500
game still. That's 100,000 people that we should market another upcoming game to. You know you

02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:04.140
want to play Dead Rising 2. One of the things that, you know, was on there for their little

02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:09.980
catchphrase was Legends Never Die or something like that. And so, Capcom, they had some DLC or

02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:14.940
whatever for costumes for like Marvel versus Capcom 3, which, by the way, doesn't have any

02:34:14.940 --> 02:34:21.180
Mega Man in it at all. I mean, Tron Bon, right? Well, but that's not Mega Man. Tron Bon's in

02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:26.460
there. So, we love the Mega Man Legends series, but there's no Mega Man characters at all. So,

02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:30.140
they put in there, you know, oh, there's alternate DLC because Legends Never Die,

02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:32.220
and neither does like fashion or something like that. It's like...

02:34:34.380 --> 02:34:37.660
I know that's literally Capcom giving the finger to that group.

02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:46.300
Oh, God. It was like, oh, I gotta find the Facebook thing now. You know it was some intern

02:34:46.300 --> 02:34:51.740
that wrote the little text there, and they were trying to get around the man that's holding them

02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:56.780
down there, the management, and try to throw him a support, but it just comes off the wrong way.

02:34:56.780 --> 02:35:01.420
Oh, I really need to find that quote because it was high-larious.

02:35:01.420 --> 02:35:05.180
High-larious. Well, while you find that, let's go to Dark Sakura. I think he has some more

02:35:05.180 --> 02:35:09.500
high-larious stuff for us. By the way, the Skype line is coming up as well as your Twitter topics

02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:17.740
in just a little bit. Oh, oh, oh. This is... It's kind of... You know how people are always

02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:22.620
finding little Easter eggs in games much later after the games have been out? You know, sort of

02:35:22.620 --> 02:35:33.020
like the blowing on the Famicon speaker to make the Pulse voice disappear and all that? Apparently,

02:35:33.020 --> 02:35:49.900
Bomberman will eat your dust and lick your crack. These were sound files... These were

02:35:50.940 --> 02:35:56.540
sound files hidden in the 1997 game Atomic Bomberman, which was the first Bomberman

02:35:56.540 --> 02:36:02.380
game made for Windows and the second Bomberman that came out on a home computer. But it has,

02:36:02.380 --> 02:36:06.620
I'm so fucking proud of you, I could just shit. You should play that one. That one's great.

02:36:08.460 --> 02:36:13.020
If I can find it. I am so fucking proud of you, I could just shit.

02:36:16.860 --> 02:36:23.340
And then there's like... Eat my dust and lick my crack. There's like, oh, my ass. And there's

02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:30.220
one that says, I'll slap you down and shit. That's right there, tits. The one after that

02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:36.700
is a little funnier. You're fucked. No, I mean, there's like multiple sounds. That's right there,

02:36:36.700 --> 02:36:43.180
sweet tits. That's right there, tits. That's right there, tits. You're talking to me, shit heel.

02:36:45.580 --> 02:36:49.900
This would be a great soundboard for L.R. Talk to the fist because the face is pissed.

02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:54.940
Next time Loki and I get in an argument about Nintendo, Dark Soccer could just say,

02:36:54.940 --> 02:37:01.100
would you guys cut out this macho shit and hurry up? Yeah, don't make me come out there

02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:09.420
and stomp both of your asses. I also like my ass is killing me, I need help. My ass is killing me,

02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:17.340
I need help. The one after that's funny too. That's really funny in like a second grade way.

02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:22.300
Oh, fuck me.

02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:29.980
Oh, fuck me.

02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:35.340
They're going to put out Mega Man Legends 3 after all.

02:37:38.780 --> 02:37:43.100
I will tell you something about this, though, is that you could actually go into the sound files

02:37:43.100 --> 02:37:49.100
in the game and make your own vocal macros for the game. Nice. So I think, I mean, I don't see

02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:54.140
why this is reported on now, except that, you know, I think it's fucking funny. Time for a

02:37:54.140 --> 02:38:01.180
fucking dirt nap. Sounds kind of like Bugs Bunny saying that. That's kind of funny that they made

02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:05.020
all these really sick things they were just never found, you know. I like the last one. You talking

02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:14.540
to me, shit heel? You talking to me, shit heel? Oh, fuck me. I like, I'll break your fucking head

02:38:14.540 --> 02:38:23.980
with a ratchet. That one's great too. Xenocorn chat says, sounds like the jerky boys did the

02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:29.340
audio. Yeah, kind of. It's kind of what it sounds like. These are the, well, you know, another game

02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:33.420
had unused voice clips and I actually, I was reading a little bit more about this. It's not

02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:39.020
a story that kind of has something, you know. Did you know in Portal 2, what's his name that did

02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:43.180
Cave Johnson? I can never remember his name. I know who he is, but I can never remember his name.

02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:47.980
The guy from Spider-Man. Yeah. He would, he refused to do certain lines because it sounded

02:38:47.980 --> 02:38:53.740
too much like a rape scene. Yeah, I read that this week. And I had posted something about it on my

02:38:53.740 --> 02:39:01.420
Tumblr, but you can find Ellen's lines, who was the voice of GLaDOS and Carolyn saying, no, I

02:39:01.420 --> 02:39:06.860
don't want this. You know, basically, but there was one line that I wish they would have recorded

02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:13.020
because I would love to hear it. It's after she gets put in GLaDOS says, I'm awake and I'm going

02:39:13.020 --> 02:39:21.180
to kill you all. So. Okay. I found that actual, that quote, and it was from the DLC for Super

02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:27.660
Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. It says, all alternate costumes for Guile, Blanca, Dalsim,

02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:32.940
Genn, and Feilong are included in this pack. Show everyone that legends never die and never go out

02:39:32.940 --> 02:39:38.700
of fashion. And to which, you know, the hundred thousand strongs, uh, for bringing back, maybe

02:39:38.700 --> 02:39:45.740
a legendary ego. Seriously? Seriously? And the chat room is lighting up a minute and a half later

02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:52.540
because of the buffer. JK Simmons is who you're trying to think of. Yes. All right. Insolacious

02:39:52.540 --> 02:40:00.380
Pop says he's fucking hot. All right. Uh, moving on a couple more stories for you guys. And then

02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:07.980
the Skype line at 1 877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. Yes. Sony soon

02:40:07.980 --> 02:40:13.980
enough will be saying, show me on the doll where they touched you. Uh, cause they actually have

02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:20.780
patented some creepy looking doll thing. And I don't know if this was the crying baby out of the

02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:27.420
PlayStation 3 commercials or what, but apparently the patent was filed back in 2008. Uh, it's only

02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:34.700
been, uh, recently been publicized. Um, it's a plush toy that's, um, packing, I guess like a

02:40:34.700 --> 02:40:40.540
wireless receiver, uh, means for reading storage medium and even a processor along with both USB

02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:47.020
and ethernet ports. It would be act as some sort of buddy for kids who can pop a disc into their

02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:52.780
PS3 and have the console communicate with it, telling it to act surprised or its arms up or a

02:40:52.780 --> 02:41:02.460
certain point, you know, certain points during gameplay or viewing or whatever. Um, weird and

02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:08.700
creepy looking. Wasn't there a controller like on the Wii for some type of game that was a doll and

02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:14.220
you put the Wii mode up its butt and yeah, there's two games. Yeah. Yes. That sounds like kind of

02:41:14.220 --> 02:41:19.100
two games. Oh my. There's my baby. Well actually it was funny cause I think one evolved into the

02:41:19.100 --> 02:41:26.700
other. There was, um, My Baby and Me. I think it was, uh, from 505 Games and that came out in

02:41:26.700 --> 02:41:32.540
Europe. I don't know if that came out over here, but we got Babysitting Mama also developed by the

02:41:32.540 --> 02:41:37.020
same studio that put out My Baby and Me. But the baby was actually cute, not disturbing looking

02:41:37.020 --> 02:41:42.300
like that picture. Yeah. Well the, to be fair though, they did have a, it was a holster that

02:41:42.300 --> 02:41:47.580
you could put on your baby so you could holster the remote that way instead of shoving it up its

02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:53.020
ass. Um, this thing is kind of creepy, but I could see, you know, some interesting implementations

02:41:53.020 --> 02:41:59.420
to that. Say you jailbreak your PS3. The PS3 can send a kill signal to the doll and stop

02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:04.780
and they can attack you in your sleep. Play fun pranks on all your family.

02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:11.740
I'm reminded that one Halloween episode of, uh, the Simpsons where it was like,

02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:15.420
I'm Christie the clown and I'm going to kill you. It's a little dolly.

02:42:18.060 --> 02:42:23.820
Uh, it is creepy though. Would you play a game that involved a doll as a peripheral Loki?

02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:29.500
Would it have to be murder dolls or something like that? I don't know. It would have to be fun.

02:42:30.620 --> 02:42:34.140
All right, one more story for you guys and then we'll get to the Skype line. This is about

02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:39.580
connectimals. Uh, guess what was announced? A sequel of sorts to connectimals. You can think

02:42:39.580 --> 02:42:45.900
of it as connectimals plus or more formally connectimals now with bears. Yes, that is

02:42:45.900 --> 02:42:50.860
exactly the name of a connectimals now with bears. Uh, it's, I guess there's going to be

02:42:50.860 --> 02:42:57.580
download content called bear Island and you'll be able to download this for $15. And, uh, well, no,

02:42:57.580 --> 02:43:01.820
it's not those types of bears. Not like the kind that were at Folsom street fair, but I like those

02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:06.220
bears. Well, these, well, I like Panda bears and that's the types of bears you're going to see in

02:43:06.220 --> 02:43:12.620
this. Yeah. So there you go. Uh, I don't know. They say five different types of bears that are

02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:17.420
going to be in it. Um, they do have some pictures. I don't, I saw a polar bear. I don't think,

02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:23.820
is that a koala? Kinda. Let me see. Let me see. My favorite is the box art. Cause it just looks

02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:29.340
like they totally just photoshopped in the little Panda there. Um, let's see. I'm trying to see if

02:43:29.340 --> 02:43:34.380
we have any koalas. That's definitely a polar bear polar bear polar bears are in there. There's

02:43:34.380 --> 02:43:39.820
a black bear and a Brown bear and I think a Brown bear climbing a tree. So I don't think they have

02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:46.460
koalas. No, you're thinking of the wrong game. I'd like to mention though, Jamie, I made that joke

02:43:46.460 --> 02:43:53.980
about a month ago on my Twitter. What? Oh really? Oh, you, Oh, you made that joke a month ago and

02:43:53.980 --> 02:43:58.780
now they just announced it officially. Interesting. How funny. Cause I put Microsoft is releasing

02:43:58.780 --> 02:44:02.220
connectables plus bears. So if I followed you on Twitter, I would have known about the bears.

02:44:02.220 --> 02:44:08.460
I sure hope that the animal type of bear, not the big hairy gay kind, but you know what? I would

02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:15.580
play that game too. Anyhow, you can download the download content for 15 bucks or there'll be a

02:44:15.580 --> 02:44:22.540
new retail release called connectables now with bears. Grr. There you go. That does it for the

02:44:22.540 --> 02:44:26.860
news tonight. We're going to go to the Skype line. It is open now at one eight seven seven

02:44:26.860 --> 02:44:31.660
game O L R or our username on Skype is orange launch radio. You can call us right now and we

02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:35.580
will talk about whatever you want to talk about. Any news stories tonight or what have you.

02:44:35.580 --> 02:44:40.940
Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, let's go to the Twitter and get some tweets to read here in

02:44:40.940 --> 02:44:44.540
between the waiting for some phone calls. Another screen capture. I'm going to put it in the chat

02:44:44.540 --> 02:44:51.260
room. God, what'd you find? Do I want to know? It's just, it's just a couple of bears. Oh yeah,

02:44:51.260 --> 02:45:00.060
probably gay bears, right? Wearing assless chaps. Nice, but they have cute little ears.

02:45:00.060 --> 02:45:03.900
Can I go to the Twitter while we wait for some calls again? One eight seven seven game O L R

02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:08.380
your username on Skype is orange launch radio. 13 X forever tweets us. So what do you guys think

02:45:08.380 --> 02:45:14.220
about the group coaster by Taito for iOS? Well, I guess we said at the top of the show, but a plus

02:45:14.220 --> 02:45:20.060
well done, right? Dark Sakura. And hopefully you'll give it a try this week. I meant to

02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:22.940
download it. I just haven't gotten a chance to. All right. We got a call coming in. Hi,

02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:27.580
you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's CD thunder. Hey, what's up CD thunder.

02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:32.060
Not much. I have a couple of things I want to discuss. All right. What?

02:45:34.140 --> 02:45:38.940
The two newest games that are out Duke Nukem forever and LA noir. Yes. What about them?

02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:43.100
Well, I like to start with the Duke Nukem forever. Please do.

02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:51.580
Well, first off, yeah, I agree with what you're saying that graphics aren't really that great.

02:45:52.540 --> 02:46:01.900
And, um, but it's still, Duke still has his, um, sarcasm that's made it, that's made the games

02:46:01.900 --> 02:46:08.060
great over the years. And, and only in this could, and only in this game could you kick a

02:46:08.060 --> 02:46:13.260
monster's eyeball and consider it a field goal. So you kind of like the potty humor in it. I mean,

02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:17.820
there's no shame in that potty humor is funny once in a while. There you go.

02:46:19.580 --> 02:46:25.500
I mean, but what about, uh, what's up with the girls giving him a blowjob in the very beginning?

02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:33.180
Because he's Duke. Yeah. And they're acting in the game and they're acting like he's actually

02:46:33.180 --> 02:46:37.500
playing it and he's got the controller and everything. Because what they're trying to do is

02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:44.140
like, imagine this is you. Yeah. Hot chicks giving you a BJ while you're playing this game.

02:46:44.140 --> 02:46:48.140
Awesome. Isn't that awesome? Yeah, I actually wouldn't mind that.

02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:52.700
Exactly. There you go. Point made. That's some pre-order bonus right there.

02:46:57.340 --> 02:47:00.620
Maybe more people would have bought the game if they gave that away as a pre-order.

02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:09.420
To pre-order the game and we'll suck your dick. Yeah. Hey. All right. Anyhow, what was the other

02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:15.420
game you wanted to say about not Duke Nukem? Uh, you said, um, LA noir. LA noir. Ah, yes.

02:47:15.420 --> 02:47:22.620
What do you think of LA noir? I actually like it. It's, um, I like how it's set in the 40,

02:47:22.620 --> 02:47:26.700
in the forties and everything with all the classic cars and everything. But I,

02:47:26.700 --> 02:47:32.380
I, it's not really set. You could tell it's not a complete forties game because they

02:47:32.380 --> 02:47:39.260
usually don't use that language, all the F words and stuff. But besides that, it's really,

02:47:39.260 --> 02:47:43.340
it looks really fun. So the F is for fun in this game.

02:47:44.380 --> 02:47:50.700
Uh. All right. Forget it. Well, I, well, I mean, you know, this game's, the thing is,

02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:54.940
if you like the toilet humor in Duke Nukem Forever, my understanding is that you get

02:47:54.940 --> 02:48:02.540
full on beaver in LA noir. So I mean, it might be a dead chick, but still she's still warm.

02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:08.540
Yeah. I mean, I like how it integrates where you have to interview the person and you have

02:48:08.540 --> 02:48:14.460
to figure out on your own if they're lying or if they're acting doubtful or if they're

02:48:14.460 --> 02:48:19.260
flat out telling a lie. Yeah. And from what I understand in the game, when you

02:48:19.260 --> 02:48:22.060
guess correct, or like, you know, you have to guess if they're telling the truth or lying

02:48:22.060 --> 02:48:25.020
and then a little chime sounds, right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:48:25.020 --> 02:48:28.540
Well, what they should do is they should, instead of like just a dumb little chime that

02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:32.460
should sound, you should get rewarded with more pussy shots. Don't you think?

02:48:33.260 --> 02:48:38.220
Yeah. And if you get it wrong, you have to look at that bear picture of the Dark

02:48:38.220 --> 02:48:41.340
Soccer just posted in chat. If you're not, they should just like, uh,

02:48:41.340 --> 02:48:45.180
edit it, like have a little, uh, blur there or something, maybe.

02:48:45.180 --> 02:48:49.340
There you go. There you go. All right. Well, anything else on your mind tonight, CD Thunder?

02:48:49.340 --> 02:48:55.740
Oh, let's see. What other games are on your radar to play soon?

02:48:57.660 --> 02:49:03.100
Um, I haven't actually played those two. I just mentioned, I was just looking at play through

02:49:03.100 --> 02:49:09.500
something, but, um, I haven't been able to listen to you guys lately because I've been working,

02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:14.860
but I'm glad I've been able to tonight. You guys have made my evening and rock on.

02:49:14.860 --> 02:49:19.740
Don't forget. There is always the podcast. You can take us with you in your pocket every week.

02:49:20.860 --> 02:49:23.900
All right. Did you say something? I couldn't hear you.

02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:27.980
Yeah. Just plug in the podcast. That's all right. OrangeLunchRadio.com. More information.

02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:32.220
You can take us in your pocket with you and listen to us whenever you want. Not just Sunday nights.

02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:35.420
All right. CD Thunder, thanks so much for the call and enjoy the potty humor.

02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:37.180
Hee hee poop poop. All right. Thanks. Bye.

02:49:37.180 --> 02:49:41.020
Bye. All right. Uh, let's go to another call since our phone's ringing off the hook. Hi,

02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:44.380
you're on Orange Lunch Radio. Who's this? Let me turn down my computer. Hey,

02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:46.620
this is Sky Judo. Hey, Sky Judo. What's on your mind?

02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:50.860
And I just have, uh, one thing I want to mention and then I want to go into a game.

02:49:50.860 --> 02:49:55.020
All right. Um, when you guys are talking about the killer dolls, do you remember, um,

02:49:55.020 --> 02:50:00.060
a couple of years ago, the news report where the, um, they had like these cabbage patch dolls that

02:50:00.060 --> 02:50:03.820
if you, I guess you hold like a spoon up to their mouth or something and they would chew

02:50:03.820 --> 02:50:06.300
and they were actually like eating little girls' hairs at night.

02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:10.860
Yes. I remember that. Yes. They had to like fix those dolls because yes,

02:50:10.860 --> 02:50:13.660
like some girl got their hair caught in it or something, right?

02:50:13.660 --> 02:50:18.060
Yeah. A lot of girls. I mean the, um, the news report had me cracking up because like if you're

02:50:18.060 --> 02:50:22.460
a fan of horror movies, you know, there's always like some type of instruction on how to kill the

02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:25.020
monster. Hilarious.

02:50:25.020 --> 02:50:28.860
Yeah. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. So on the news, they actually had

02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:33.100
instructions on what you would have to do if you caught the cabbage, the cabbage patch doll

02:50:33.660 --> 02:50:37.740
eating your kid late at night. Like you had to twist the head off and there was like this whole

02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:42.540
ritual that you had to do. It was great. That sounds awesome.

02:50:42.540 --> 02:50:46.540
I would have just gotten a pair of scissors. There was actually like four main things they

02:50:46.540 --> 02:50:51.260
tell you to do to like dismantle the doll before I ate your kid. It's great.

02:50:51.260 --> 02:50:56.620
Oh my God. That's awesome. And yeah, don't feed the dolls after midnight and not leave them in

02:50:56.620 --> 02:51:01.100
direct sunlight. Yeah. You gotta leave that story and read it.

02:51:01.100 --> 02:51:03.820
Yeah. I'll leave that story. What's the game you want to talk about?

02:51:04.700 --> 02:51:09.340
It's a card game actually. I know everyone on all games is, uh, you know, they're like

02:51:09.340 --> 02:51:13.660
ready to rip their hair out because I've been calling every show talking about it.

02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:17.740
Now it's our turn now. We're the last show of the week. So it's our turn, right?

02:51:17.740 --> 02:51:23.900
You, you guys have to try Yogi. Look at this game up, man. It's, it's a fucking awesome game.

02:51:23.900 --> 02:51:29.740
Yogi like the bear or the brand of tea. Well, um, it comes from some type of a

02:51:29.740 --> 02:51:33.500
Japanese saying it means to read. Like it's supposed to read your opponent's mind or

02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:37.260
something, you know, some, it has some kind of mystical kind of crap.

02:51:37.260 --> 02:51:40.860
So you're not, you're not talking about like a card based video game. You're talking about

02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:45.740
like actual table and cards. I'm down with that. Like one of my favorite games ever is

02:51:45.740 --> 02:51:50.460
Millborn. It's a French game. That's cards. And it's like cars racing. It's a lot of fun.

02:51:50.460 --> 02:51:53.100
And I know that tons of people are going to magic. Those are all cards.

02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:58.380
Yeah. Uh, you need to Google this game, uh, Google Yomi, uh, Yomi. And, uh, the website

02:51:58.380 --> 02:52:03.980
is, uh, Serlin games. That's like what you can get the info on the game. And then, uh,

02:52:03.980 --> 02:52:08.780
there's also a, um, a website that allows you to play the game for free against either

02:52:08.780 --> 02:52:13.260
computer or other places so you can get a hang of it. But I re I recommend it. It's

02:52:13.260 --> 02:52:19.820
like, um, the guy with the Yomi Yomi. What? Oh, not Yogi. I was thinking Yogi bear.

02:52:20.860 --> 02:52:25.740
All right. So Yomi. Okay. Got it. The guy who, uh, the guy who invented it, he, uh,

02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:30.700
he's some type of, um, high ranking, like street fighter player. Like he's done a few of those,

02:52:30.700 --> 02:52:35.180
whatever the hell you call them. Oh, this is kind of interesting. This looks like I'm looking at all

02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:42.380
the cards. The artwork looks very nice. Uh, yeah, I'm on this. It's Serlin games.com apparently

02:52:42.380 --> 02:52:46.860
sells this. It's the Japanese word for reading and reading the mind of your opponent. It's competitive

02:52:46.860 --> 02:52:50.380
card game that simulates a battle between two characters. It was like a fighting game,

02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:56.860
but a card game. Interesting. It's great. And what I like about it best is, um, it's not technically

02:52:56.860 --> 02:53:02.460
a trading card game. Like as once you, there's like a set amount of cards that you get and that's

02:53:02.460 --> 02:53:06.380
it. It's like, you don't have to collect any more cards. There aren't any like rare cards that you

02:53:06.380 --> 02:53:11.420
have to go out looking for and spending tons of money on. It's just a complete card game.

02:53:11.420 --> 02:53:15.340
You know, what else is interesting about this is that I noticed every card has traditional

02:53:15.340 --> 02:53:20.860
card stamps on it. Like the Dodge card can substitute as a three of hearts and the flame

02:53:20.860 --> 02:53:26.940
arrow is a Jack of spades. Like that's, that's interesting to me that they, yeah, every character

02:53:26.940 --> 02:53:31.820
is a, uh, is a deck you could actually use as a deck of playing cards. Huh? It comes with a

02:53:31.820 --> 02:53:37.420
complete, I guess, what is it? 52 playing cards deck. Yeah. Yeah. So that's pretty much the game

02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:41.820
in a nutshell. All right. Where can I buy this at Walmart or do I have to get it online? Uh,

02:53:41.820 --> 02:53:47.660
well there's a, um, there's a download version that you can, um, I think it's like 1495. Uh,

02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:51.100
you can add, it's called an employee where I guess you just print it out from your printer.

02:53:51.100 --> 02:53:55.420
Oh wow. Uh, you get little card sleeves and you can play it that way. Or you can go

02:53:56.060 --> 02:53:59.740
the super expensive route and get it for like a hundred bucks to complete game.

02:54:00.300 --> 02:54:04.460
Yeah, I'll take the cheap route. No, but I, I, I did the battle and it's,

02:54:04.460 --> 02:54:08.060
I'm not going to take up all your time, but I did the math on it because it looked pretty expensive.

02:54:08.060 --> 02:54:13.420
But when you do the math on it, like if you buy the deck separately, um, each deck comes with two

02:54:13.420 --> 02:54:19.020
characters. You're getting like decks of playing cards and that's like $24 in change. So if you've

02:54:19.020 --> 02:54:22.780
bought them loosely, you actually be paying a little bit more than what you put a full game.

02:54:22.780 --> 02:54:26.060
So it's not, it's not entirely. You know what though? A hundred bucks

02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:29.180
doesn't seem so bad when you consider how much I spent on magic back in the day.

02:54:30.460 --> 02:54:35.580
So the website to play it online free, I'll put it in the chat room, but you need to try that.

02:54:35.580 --> 02:54:39.340
All right. Oh, that I can do free. I like that word. You should have started with that. All

02:54:39.340 --> 02:54:46.780
right. All right. Thanks so much for the call and for the heads up on a new game later. All right.

02:54:47.500 --> 02:54:50.620
I want to do tweets, but we keep getting calls and, and I definitely want to hear

02:54:50.620 --> 02:54:53.100
what the callers have to say. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:54:53.900 --> 02:54:57.340
No guys. It's Zina Corp. Hey Casey, how you doing? Hey Zina Corp. How you doing?

02:54:58.060 --> 02:55:01.660
You know, just keeping it real. How are you keeping it real?

02:55:02.780 --> 02:55:06.300
But by going to court, you know, long story. Wow. I'll talk about that.

02:55:06.300 --> 02:55:09.740
Good luck with that. I hope it's not Judge Judy presiding. She can be kind of mean.

02:55:10.300 --> 02:55:14.460
Yeah, that's true. It's kind of a rough. Well, good luck. Well, what's on your mind?

02:55:14.460 --> 02:55:16.860
Happier thoughts. Video games. Take our mind off of that.

02:55:17.420 --> 02:55:24.700
Good Lord. Video games. I tried getting back into some games that I passed over because I wasn't

02:55:24.700 --> 02:55:30.460
sure how far their reach would be, but since I've been on YouTube for the past two months,

02:55:30.460 --> 02:55:35.420
almost nonstop, I finally decided to try out both of the, uh, defense of the agent clones,

02:55:35.420 --> 02:55:39.660
legends of, uh, what league of legends and the heroes of new earth.

02:55:40.460 --> 02:55:42.940
League of legends. Yep. I know those games. What'd you think?

02:55:45.180 --> 02:55:50.700
I guess it depends on the time of the day you're there. Like, especially it seems that these games

02:55:50.700 --> 02:55:55.580
took off more in Europe than they did here. So while you're still getting European players,

02:55:55.580 --> 02:56:00.540
everything's calm, you know, when you're in a newbie room and they're actually newbies playing

02:56:00.540 --> 02:56:04.140
and if there's some more experienced players actually trying to help the people learn,

02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:09.020
but the moment the afternoon comes up and all the US comes up, uh, it's pretty much like,

02:56:09.020 --> 02:56:11.660
get the hell out you noob left and right. It's ridiculous.

02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:16.140
See, I hate that shit. Like, I wish games had a better structure for noobs how to play.

02:56:16.140 --> 02:56:20.540
You know, one game I randomly played this week, I forgot to mention in my top of the week was

02:56:20.540 --> 02:56:24.060
Starcraft 2. I just randomly was like, I want to play Star Jeweled again because I love the

02:56:24.060 --> 02:56:27.980
Star Jeweled add-on. That like made that game 10 times better. And you know, part of me was like,

02:56:27.980 --> 02:56:31.820
I should learn how to play like real Starcraft and then go online and play. But then I'm like,

02:56:31.820 --> 02:56:36.700
no, I'm too scared because there's no, like, there's nobody like me. Everybody that plays

02:56:36.700 --> 02:56:39.260
Starcraft online is already really good and wah.

02:56:40.380 --> 02:56:45.340
Yes, that's the truth. I tried getting back into a game here and of course I'm still in the Bronze

02:56:45.340 --> 02:56:51.100
League, but now Bronze League is quite seasoned. So you really have no hope. You got to play your

02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:55.260
buddies and that's it. That's about the only way to do it. What do you think about some of the

02:56:55.260 --> 02:56:59.580
upcoming Defense of the Angels? Like there's a Blizzard Dota is coming to Starcraft 2 speaking

02:56:59.580 --> 02:57:04.220
of which, and then we have actual Dota 2 from Valve soon.

02:57:04.940 --> 02:57:09.660
I'm not holding my breath. The game is not going to change at all. I mean, it's good. It's going

02:57:09.660 --> 02:57:15.100
to play almost exactly the same. Even like with Heroes of Newerth and League of Legends, the only

02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:20.780
thing they really change is how the functionality of the game and it's switching from one to the

02:57:20.780 --> 02:57:25.260
other is painful. You get set up for the way one game works and it messes you up for the other. So

02:57:25.260 --> 02:57:27.420
you pretty much got to pick your flavor and stick with it.

02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:30.460
So who do you think will walk away victorious at the end of the day, Blizzard, Valve,

02:57:30.460 --> 02:57:33.500
or one of these other games? I hope they all drop to tell you the truth.

02:57:33.500 --> 02:57:38.540
They need to work on something more original. Touché.

02:57:38.540 --> 02:57:43.980
Hey, I told that to a Blizzard headhunter while I was in school. It's like I called them out on

02:57:43.980 --> 02:57:50.700
it. It's like, why does Warcraft 3 play like Warcraft 2 and Starcraft? And he did it. Yeah,

02:57:50.700 --> 02:57:56.380
everybody was there like, because they sell gazillions. That's why they all play the same.

02:57:56.380 --> 02:58:01.260
Yeah, exactly. Because it's the same damn game. And I heard he actually wanted to talk to me

02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:08.940
after the headhunter briefing he was doing at the school, but I think I already left in disgust. So

02:58:08.940 --> 02:58:13.420
I didn't get a chance to give it to him directly. Who knows? I might've missed out on a job.

02:58:15.020 --> 02:58:21.340
Nice. Well, good luck. I hope maybe you'll get a second shot with Blizzard at some point. Don't

02:58:21.340 --> 02:58:25.900
mention that all the games are the same. Also, I got one final thing for you. Has

02:58:25.900 --> 02:58:32.140
anybody seen the Comic-Con coverage for the Star Wars MMO?

02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:40.300
Not extensively. I haven't been really watching this carefully. I'm kind of just waiting for when

02:58:40.300 --> 02:58:44.700
the game gets really closer to release, but I know a lot did come out of Comic-Con.

02:58:44.700 --> 02:58:48.940
Yeah. Based off what I saw, because they had actually, they showed the first part of an

02:58:48.940 --> 02:58:55.820
instance adventure. And any wild head that played this game, I don't think you're really going to

02:58:55.820 --> 02:59:00.540
see any difference. I see based off what I saw in the video, I mean, it's up on YouTube now,

02:59:01.180 --> 02:59:07.420
but based off that footage, you still have the same tropes. You still have the same

02:59:08.380 --> 02:59:12.540
player classes, the same structure. That's what I heard is that it's so well with

02:59:12.540 --> 02:59:16.860
Star Wars laid over it. And I was really hoping for a little bit more. Where can I find that video?

02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:22.220
Uh, it's on YouTube. Let me, I'll see if I can dig up the link for you and put it in chat.

02:59:22.220 --> 02:59:24.940
Okay Ed, do that for me and I'll check it out here in a minute.

02:59:24.940 --> 02:59:30.300
Yeah man. That's pretty much all I had. I'd say wait until you see more footage

02:59:30.300 --> 02:59:33.500
on the game before you make an adjustment to do the initial investment.

02:59:33.500 --> 02:59:37.420
Well, you know, we'll see how much it is and I definitely won't get that collector's edition,

02:59:37.420 --> 02:59:41.420
but you never know. Especially if they cut the price as fast as they did on Rift,

02:59:41.420 --> 02:59:43.980
I definitely have no excuse not to check it out.

02:59:43.980 --> 02:59:47.260
Yeah, but this LucasArts stuff, they're not cutting that price anytime soon.

02:59:47.260 --> 02:59:51.260
That's true. All right Xenocore, we're going to let you go buddy so we get more calls. Take care.

02:59:51.260 --> 02:59:52.860
All right. I'll take that link for you. Take care.

02:59:52.860 --> 02:59:58.620
Thanks. Bye. 1877 game OLR or username on Skype is orange launch radio if you'd like to get through.

02:59:58.620 --> 03:00:01.660
Let's do some more tweets while we wait for at least one more call to come through here.

03:00:02.220 --> 03:00:07.820
Kibben project tweets us sensationalism go. Sad as it is, if he felt pains in his chest,

03:00:07.820 --> 03:00:11.660
he should have called an ambulance then and there. You might know what story is coming.

03:00:11.660 --> 03:00:17.260
It's a link to a story about death by Xbox. That's the headline from The Sun.

03:00:17.260 --> 03:00:20.060
Gotta love it. I wonder whose phone they hacked to get that headline.

03:00:20.780 --> 03:00:28.700
Game addict 20 killed by deep vein thrombosis. Apparently a 20-year-old died from a blood clot

03:00:28.700 --> 03:00:34.700
because he played his Xbox for up to 12 hours at a time. And his parents, of course, were stunned

03:00:34.700 --> 03:00:39.980
by it saying, quote, as a parent, you think playing computer games can't do them any harm

03:00:39.980 --> 03:00:43.980
because you know what they are doing. Kids all over the country are playing these games for

03:00:43.980 --> 03:00:49.660
long periods. They don't realize it could kill them. I mean, 12 hours at a time, though,

03:00:50.620 --> 03:00:56.620
shouldn't you? It's a parent sessive. That was not a good way to do it. That's the parents

03:00:56.620 --> 03:01:04.540
not interfering and saying, hey, you need to slack off. Yeah. So maybe, um, your kid was obsessive

03:01:04.540 --> 03:01:10.380
and you should have put a stop to it. That too. There is that. All right. Uh, let's see,

03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:15.740
going on to more tweets. Uh, Roboditya Knight tweets us saying, hi, OLR. Have any of you played

03:01:15.740 --> 03:01:20.620
Action 52 for the NES? This is another one of those multi-cart games, isn't it? I don't think

03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:24.460
I have. Let me look it up real quick. I want to see what this is. Does that sound familiar,

03:01:24.460 --> 03:01:29.180
Dark Soccer? You, you've, you know, a lot of the old school stuff. Yeah, but I never played

03:01:29.180 --> 03:01:35.740
multi-carts. I'm assuming it is. Just from like ROM sets, but I haven't really played it because

03:01:35.740 --> 03:01:39.020
why bother playing a multi-cart when you can play the actual game? I am actually looking at the

03:01:39.020 --> 03:01:44.940
multi-cart. It did come out in 91 and then it was also out in 93 for Genesis consoles. They say a

03:01:44.940 --> 03:01:49.580
lot of the titles had major glitches in it. Let me get to the next call. We'll talk more about this

03:01:49.580 --> 03:01:54.460
in a minute. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hey, it's Strelok. Hey, Strelok,

03:01:54.460 --> 03:02:01.820
what's up, buddy? Uh, not much. Uh, just wanted to, uh, say well played Nintendo. Well played.

03:02:01.820 --> 03:02:06.220
Ah, I was hoping somebody would call in on this. What did you think about all this Nintendo news

03:02:06.220 --> 03:02:14.780
this week? Um, it's both. You can tell it, you know, they were desperate because the 3DS hasn't

03:02:14.780 --> 03:02:19.340
really been selling well because they really should have waited like another year. Or at

03:02:19.340 --> 03:02:27.100
least until the holidays. Yeah, um, but at the same time, the way they did it was just fucking

03:02:27.100 --> 03:02:35.820
genius because everybody wins. People who are, have waited, which is probably a lot of people

03:02:35.820 --> 03:02:42.860
because, you know, people are waiting for your actual games to come out and, uh, you know,

03:02:42.860 --> 03:02:48.620
and for like a price drop. And, you know, people who have already bought the system,

03:02:48.620 --> 03:02:54.620
you know, they're getting 20 free games and some exclusive stuff. So, you know,

03:02:54.620 --> 03:03:02.860
it's good for everybody. And also it's really good for Nintendo because, um,

03:03:05.420 --> 03:03:13.180
they've really made sure by doing this that the 3DS is probably going to be, end up being the,

03:03:13.180 --> 03:03:17.500
uh, number one Christmas gift this year with the price drop. You know,

03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:21.340
I could see though, to be fair, as much as I, I pretty much agree with you on all these points,

03:03:21.340 --> 03:03:25.500
I, I, to be fair, I could see where somebody could still be pissed off at Nintendo because

03:03:25.500 --> 03:03:29.340
maybe these 20 years, maybe Virtual Console just isn't really interesting to them. Or,

03:03:29.340 --> 03:03:32.860
you know, they already bought them all on the Wii, so they don't really want them on the,

03:03:32.860 --> 03:03:37.580
uh, 3DS. It's kind of like $80, you know, that's still a steep cut.

03:03:38.220 --> 03:03:40.860
You're getting free stuff. I mean, they, they could have just gone,

03:03:40.860 --> 03:03:47.660
uh, yeah, we're not going to, you know, we're not going to throw you a bone and look at Apple.

03:03:48.380 --> 03:03:52.620
Yeah. It's just the price of being an early adopter. And that's not even like,

03:03:52.620 --> 03:03:56.060
that's not even just with the 3DS. That's with like games in general. Dude,

03:03:56.060 --> 03:04:00.380
Loki just mentioned the price of Duke Nukem Forever dropped already. That game is maybe

03:04:00.380 --> 03:04:06.220
two months old, you know, and you didn't get nothing for free, no free hats for being an

03:04:06.220 --> 03:04:11.900
early adopter. So, I mean, this is just the nature of the beast. Yeah. But I, I think it's, uh,

03:04:14.140 --> 03:04:19.020
I thought it was brilliant that they put the spin on it that they did because,

03:04:20.780 --> 03:04:26.700
yeah, it was a desperate act, but it's going to, I think it's really going to save them in the

03:04:26.700 --> 03:04:33.660
long run because, you know, like eventually, like, well, the, like the DS launch was kind

03:04:33.660 --> 03:04:38.860
of shitty too. That didn't have very many good games for a while. That's true. But look at it

03:04:38.860 --> 03:04:46.220
now. The thing it had going for it most of all was the Mario 64 port that was on it. Yeah. But

03:04:46.220 --> 03:04:52.700
now it's the best selling handheld, like pretty much ever. I mean, like the original Game Boy,

03:04:52.700 --> 03:04:58.380
but it's, it's, it's doing well. It is. All right. Well, any other thoughts on your mind

03:04:58.380 --> 03:05:04.220
tonight before we let you go? Um, yeah, I'll crack your head with a fucking ratchet.

03:05:05.420 --> 03:05:11.260
Gee, thanks. All right, buddy. Thanks for the call. All right. Later. I wish I still had that

03:05:11.260 --> 03:05:16.460
soundboard up. I would have played something in response to that. It's on our Tumblr. I just,

03:05:16.460 --> 03:05:19.500
I don't have the Tumblr up. All right. That's going to do it for the calls tonight. We got

03:05:19.500 --> 03:05:22.860
to get through the rest of these tweets. Thank you guys for calling tonight. Sorry,

03:05:22.860 --> 03:05:26.460
if you didn't get through, but you can always send us an email mailbag at orangelaungerated.com

03:05:26.460 --> 03:05:31.100
or you might be able to get a last minute tweet in real quick. Look at it. The suggested retail

03:05:31.100 --> 03:05:38.140
of action 52, $200, but it really was, I guess like 52 different like games that were in it.

03:05:38.140 --> 03:05:43.100
Like they actually have, they were all different games. I'm sure they were all shitty. In fact,

03:05:43.100 --> 03:05:49.500
one of them, I guess, crashes right when you started up. Awesome. All right. Uh, let's see,

03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:54.540
going on to more tweets here at twitter.com slash O L R M and Ziba tweets us about, you know,

03:05:54.540 --> 03:05:59.660
we were talking earlier in the show about WTF battleship. She tweeted us the monopoly

03:05:59.660 --> 03:06:03.260
parody movie trailer. I don't know if I want to play this whole thing. We can start in the

03:06:03.260 --> 03:06:09.900
beginning here. Let's see. Richie Benjamin never followed in his father's footsteps

03:06:12.300 --> 03:06:16.940
until one day when all that changed, this is where your father left you

03:06:16.940 --> 03:06:21.420
a board game.

03:06:29.180 --> 03:06:30.140
Thanks a lot, dad.

03:06:38.140 --> 03:06:41.660
He threw all the, he threw all the houses on the ground and then of course the house shook

03:06:41.660 --> 03:06:46.140
go in a world where money matters.

03:06:50.460 --> 03:06:52.460
You lost kid. Who are you?

03:06:57.020 --> 03:07:00.380
For the first time in his life, Richie is taking a chance.

03:07:02.780 --> 03:07:05.340
I want to teach you all about the game.

03:07:05.340 --> 03:07:15.180
Rolling the dice. Yeah, it's got strippers. This is already better than the battleship trailer.

03:07:15.980 --> 03:07:23.980
Never fall in love. Unless it's with money. The community chest.

03:07:23.980 --> 03:07:34.620
Oh, this is great. Love her more than money. I don't care what you think because now I have

03:07:34.620 --> 03:07:44.380
the monopoly. Oh son, don't you know only I can win this game this summer. Do not pass go.

03:07:44.380 --> 03:07:54.380
You didn't pay the luxury tax. Go to jail. Do not collect $200.

03:08:06.780 --> 03:08:08.700
That was great. I would see that.

03:08:08.700 --> 03:08:14.780
They should screen that at midnight at the shadiest looking theater in town.

03:08:16.780 --> 03:08:19.900
After Rocky Horror, of course. Of course.

03:08:22.060 --> 03:08:25.820
Act Def tweets is something that somehow we missed in our news feed tonight. Dragon Age

03:08:25.820 --> 03:08:30.700
got removed from Steam because of DLC issues. Basically EA has a lot of sand in their vagina

03:08:30.700 --> 03:08:34.860
and it basically has to do with origin. But I guess what they're saying is it has to do with

03:08:34.860 --> 03:08:39.740
the whole, you know, it's that whole thing where Steam wants to control the download stuff but EA

03:08:39.740 --> 03:08:45.420
really wants that in their own house and herpa derp. EA says at EA we offer our games and content

03:08:45.420 --> 03:08:51.180
to all major download services. Unfortunately Steam has adopted a set of restricted terms

03:08:51.180 --> 03:08:55.820
of service which limit how developers interact with customers to sell downloadable content.

03:08:55.820 --> 03:09:00.620
No other download services adopted this practice. Consequently some of our games have been removed

03:09:00.620 --> 03:09:09.420
by Steam. Whatever. That's a bummer. Dragon Age is a pretty cool game. Uh, apparently,

03:09:09.420 --> 03:09:15.820
uh, Darth Tetsuya is tweeting and saying WonderCon 2012 moved from San Francisco to Anaheim

03:09:16.460 --> 03:09:24.380
just for the next year. That's kind of a big deal. Like, that's far. That's a six hour drive between

03:09:24.380 --> 03:09:30.060
the two if not more. WonderCon, which is probably the second or third largest comic convention next

03:09:30.060 --> 03:09:38.060
to actual Comic-Con and maybe what, New York Comic-Con, uh, is moving. But I guess it's just

03:09:38.060 --> 03:09:45.980
this year. Yeah. Interesting. Oh, but they're saying now there are some updates saying nothing

03:09:45.980 --> 03:09:51.900
has actually been confirmed about this. I guess Anaheim is in discussion right now.

03:09:52.620 --> 03:09:55.420
So it's don't freak out yet. Yeah, maybe it's don't freak out yet.

03:09:55.420 --> 03:09:59.900
Uh, let's see. Uh, Darth Tetsuya is saying Wonder what the holdup was for the worldwide release of

03:09:59.900 --> 03:10:07.420
La Mulana. It's Germany! I guess La Mulana has been held up for release in Germany. What is it?

03:10:07.420 --> 03:10:14.300
Uh, I'm trying to read here. The ratings board of Germany, excuse me, the USK,

03:10:16.300 --> 03:10:21.100
uh, Nigoro, who developed the game, submitted the game for review to the ESRB, the OFLC,

03:10:21.100 --> 03:10:26.140
and the USK two months ago. Uh, those, the other two boards have the game ready to go,

03:10:26.140 --> 03:10:32.060
but the USK has not finished yet. Interesting. I guess they can't release it until it gets reviewed.

03:10:32.860 --> 03:10:38.860
Sorry, Joe. I know you're a big fan of La Mulana. Maybe soon. Spazinator giving us an update on the

03:10:38.860 --> 03:10:45.100
PS3 saga. I sent my PS3 in for repairs this past Friday. I figure that I'm likely to get it back

03:10:45.100 --> 03:10:51.820
early next week. We will see. SSJ100Matt tweets us saying the only way to defeat China is to attack

03:10:51.820 --> 03:10:59.740
their productivity. Coming soon to China. Angry Birds. That's right. Angry Birds is coming to

03:10:59.740 --> 03:11:05.180
China. Uh, I guess, uh, in order to prevent knockoffs and so forth. I don't know. It was

03:11:05.180 --> 03:11:09.740
officially launched in May through a partnership with Chinese mobile games network Downjoy.

03:11:09.740 --> 03:11:15.340
Uh, but so far, there's been all these knockoffs and pirated versions on jailbroken iPhones,

03:11:15.340 --> 03:11:21.580
but now Rovio has teamed up with the ad network Madhouse to try and expand the game's presence.

03:11:22.940 --> 03:11:27.820
I still say, uh, Angry Birds isn't really all that, and I don't understand why so many people

03:11:27.820 --> 03:11:36.540
are so like losing their shit over it. Amen. All right. Uh, Tigerclaw sends us a tweet here.

03:11:36.540 --> 03:11:41.740
Samsung is going to be manufacturing the PlayStation Vita CPU. Uh, the core processing

03:11:41.740 --> 03:11:46.780
unit or central processing unit of Samsung's upcoming portable will be, excuse me, by Sony's

03:11:46.780 --> 03:11:52.140
upcoming portable will be done by Samsung. These are from Samsung. These are from online reports

03:11:52.140 --> 03:11:58.060
out of Japan. Uh, this was on the website of Japanese industry paper, the semiconductor

03:11:58.060 --> 03:12:04.220
industry news. Not a lot of further con, uh, text besides just that, but there you go.

03:12:04.220 --> 03:12:12.300
Samsung will play a role in the actual development of the Vita. There it is. Your Twitter topics,

03:12:12.300 --> 03:12:17.420
twitter.com slash O L R. If you want to get in your tweets in the future. By the way,

03:12:17.420 --> 03:12:24.620
huh? Did you hear about the, um, last sales reports on, um, smartphones? Motor roll is dipped

03:12:24.620 --> 03:12:30.460
way down. Well, yeah, cause libraries going out, it's all Androids and, uh, iPhones. Now

03:12:30.460 --> 03:12:35.500
the top three is Apple, Samsung and Nokia. Interesting. I would think blackberries are

03:12:35.500 --> 03:12:39.900
still big in the corporate world. They're interesting. They've gone way down. They're

03:12:39.900 --> 03:12:46.060
not, they're not in the top three. So interesting. All right. Well, uh, before we close out the

03:12:46.060 --> 03:12:49.020
show tonight, I got to go to Loki and ask if there's any last minute stories he wants

03:12:49.020 --> 03:12:57.100
to tear through. Um, no. Wow. We, we covered quite a bit of everything. So there you go.

03:12:57.100 --> 03:13:04.700
All right. Well, uh, we'll work on more last minute stories for next week, but I guess

03:13:04.700 --> 03:13:08.220
we've covered everything so far tonight. If you think we missed a topic, you can always

03:13:08.220 --> 03:13:12.300
email us mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and we'll bring it up on next week's show.

03:13:12.300 --> 03:13:15.820
Um, thank you guys of course, as always for downloading our show and supporting orange

03:13:15.820 --> 03:13:20.700
lounge radio. We really appreciate it. Remember we do the show for free. We don't play commercials.

03:13:20.700 --> 03:13:24.380
All we really ask help spread the word about orange launch radio. Get more butts in our

03:13:24.380 --> 03:13:28.860
chat room on Sunday night. Tell a friend about the show. Even if you're like, I don't really

03:13:28.860 --> 03:13:32.620
know who I could tell about orange on video, help spread the word on websites. Uh, there's

03:13:32.620 --> 03:13:37.260
people that put signatures on forums, uh, or just as simple as leaving a five star review

03:13:37.260 --> 03:13:41.500
in iTunes really goes a long way because that drives the popularity rankings and helps us

03:13:41.500 --> 03:13:45.820
get exposure to more people. Uh, there's been some reports on the internet this week that

03:13:45.820 --> 03:13:50.540
I've seen come up on Google plus and all that, uh, people linking stories saying podcasting

03:13:50.540 --> 03:13:57.580
is dying. Well to that I say because maybe corporate podcasting is dying, but people

03:13:57.580 --> 03:14:00.940
like us were never really in it for the money anyways. And we were doing this since before

03:14:00.940 --> 03:14:06.620
podcasting. We're not going away anytime soon. We're awesome sauce, but we can still use

03:14:06.620 --> 03:14:11.100
every piece of word of mouth we can get and we'll continue to provide this show for your work day

03:14:11.100 --> 03:14:17.580
and whatever else. So there you go, but we can't have call it a show until we get around

03:14:17.580 --> 03:14:22.060
and get everybody's final thoughts. So dark soccer, what's your final thought tonight?

03:14:22.060 --> 03:14:27.340
Um, I think we're going to miss pinkberry. Yes, this makes me sad, but, uh, we'll, we'll do it

03:14:27.340 --> 03:14:33.260
another time. Maybe on Tuesday. I would like to do a tiny little plug. Look on geek life tomorrow,

03:14:33.260 --> 03:14:40.300
geek-life.com for a special geeks in history that has to do with Nintendo. All right. A Nintendo

03:14:40.300 --> 03:14:45.740
geek in history. Yes. Very cool. Uh, Loki, your last minute story tonight. Oh, I don't have any

03:14:45.740 --> 03:14:51.500
last minute stories, but excuse me, your final thought tonight. Uh, fortunately today is both,

03:14:51.500 --> 03:14:59.500
uh, very sad and, uh, but kind of happy tomorrow though. Sad because it is the two year anniversary

03:14:59.500 --> 03:15:07.180
of the twins death. Unfortunately, uh, we lost two babies two years ago. Um, however happy news,

03:15:07.180 --> 03:15:11.900
though. Josh's first birthday is tomorrow. So, uh, happy birthday to Josh. I never realized it

03:15:11.900 --> 03:15:16.380
was in such class, close proximity to each other. Everything is on the 31st of the first.

03:15:17.180 --> 03:15:23.340
Interesting. Well, you know, um, looking forward, uh, I look forward to Josh's first birthday. I'm

03:15:23.340 --> 03:15:27.500
sure it'll be looking forward to seeing pictures of the mess he's going to make. Oh, we've already

03:15:27.500 --> 03:15:33.180
fed him, um, that kind of stuff. Like extra for his nephew and that party we actually had,

03:15:33.180 --> 03:15:39.260
we had a professional, uh, pictures taken of him and he's eating a cupcake and that was funny.

03:15:39.260 --> 03:15:45.020
Oh, that's cute. We had a picture of my brother Matthew when he was one sitting in his high chair

03:15:45.020 --> 03:15:50.540
with a cake in front of him and half the cake demolished by smash, smash, smash. I think

03:15:50.540 --> 03:15:54.300
there's a picture like that of me out there somewhere too. You'll never see it. He's having

03:15:54.300 --> 03:16:02.140
his, uh, birthday party next Saturday. It is a pork theme party. Um, awesome. And, uh, so we

03:16:02.140 --> 03:16:07.260
all have a little piggy cake then, but no tomorrow we want the leftovers. Uh, tomorrow we're taking

03:16:07.260 --> 03:16:12.540
him to, uh, at least I do. Maybe not dark, sorry. We're taking him to, um, the gallery to go on the

03:16:12.540 --> 03:16:18.540
merry-go-round. Oh, fun. Good time. And maybe have some ice cream. Uh, my final thought tonight is

03:16:18.540 --> 03:16:25.260
there may not be time for pink berry, but there's always time for tacos. Yes. That's going to do it

03:16:25.260 --> 03:16:28.700
for another episode of orange launch radio. Thanks again for tuning in and spending your day with us

03:16:28.700 --> 03:16:32.300
