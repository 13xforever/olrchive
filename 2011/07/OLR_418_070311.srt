00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:24,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, July 3rd, 2011, online videos may soon make you a criminal, Nintendo spends big bucks on a new facility, and an early build of an anticipated 360 game leaks to the internet.

2
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:37,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:46,380
[SPEAKER_10]: We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com as we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,980
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,182
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:54,123
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

[SPEAKER_08]: Mar Mar Mar Mar Mar Mar

8
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:19,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

9
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,305
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you, Loki?

10
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:21,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing good.

11
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:21,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.

12
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:22,647
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

13
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're going to get into, of course, all the good stuff we like to do at the top of the show.

14
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,811
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your gaming week and so forth?

15
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,873
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm going to start off tonight's show with a bang.

16
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:31,515
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's going to be in our chat room.

17
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:33,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat.OrangeLounge.

18
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:35,238
[SPEAKER_10]: If I even knew our website.

19
00:01:35,538 --> 00:01:43,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com I'm going to give away one of my birthday presents right here, live on air, starting off the show tonight.

20
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:46,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I love the listeners that much, I'm going to share my birthday with you guys.

21
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:50,905
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an Xbox 360 game, so I'm going to give it to one of you guys in chat.

22
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:56,947
[SPEAKER_10]: So all I need you to do is whoever wants it in the chat room say, I want Rob's 360 game.

23
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:57,768
[SPEAKER_10]: You just type that out.

24
00:01:57,848 --> 00:01:59,048
[SPEAKER_10]: I want Rob's 360 game.

25
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:00,209
[SPEAKER_10]: You only say it once.

26
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,330
[SPEAKER_10]: If you say it more than once, you've disqualified yourself.

27
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:24,382
[SPEAKER_10]: at the end we'll pick a number one through whatever of how many of you said I want Rob's 360 game and we are going to give it away right here at the top of the show this week I'll tell you more about what it is after our gaming week see that's what we do is a little thing called a radio tease it's Yaris I can say with a clean conscience this is not Yaris it is something I received for my birthday on the 360 and I'm giving it away

28
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:26,163
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

29
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:27,363
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to sweeten the pot a little bit.

30
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:31,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only are we going to give it away, I'm going to sign it, so is DarkSakura and Loki.

31
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:33,208
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going to be like an autographed OLR game.

32
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:34,348
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll sign it with my butt.

33
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:36,350
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura will sign it with her butt.

34
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:36,730
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

35
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

36
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,391
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to give it away.

37
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:38,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

38
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:39,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it away.

39
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:40,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it away now.

40
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:40,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

41
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:42,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

42
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:42,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's start off.

43
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:44,455
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

44
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:48,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I played WoW.

45
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:51,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I got 50 mounts today.

46
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I have an albino drake.

47
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So it has a skin condition.

48
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:01,814
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's about it.

49
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:03,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Next.

50
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:03,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Lol.

51
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:05,377
[SPEAKER_10]: You're addicted to WoW.

52
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:06,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Your fault.

53
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:09,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, then Loki, how was your gaming week?

54
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been playing anything that's not WoW?

55
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:18,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course I haven't been playing WoW, because I don't get WoW, nor would I want to play WoW.

56
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:21,508
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I played more Grand Theft Auto this week.

57
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Same old stuff.

58
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,435
[SPEAKER_11]: and then of course Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon because it's awesome.

59
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:37,990
[SPEAKER_11]: I got that early this week and was able to play through quite a bit of it and I'm happy to say it exceeds my expectations in every possible way.

60
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,531
[SPEAKER_11]: It is...

61
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,721
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

62
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,521
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, it's just, it's very fun.

63
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And the multiplayer over the internet is actually pretty fun.

64
00:04:06,103 --> 00:04:14,470
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been playing a few games, uh, because I picked up a few copies of it, um, between my coworkers, and it was pretty cool.

65
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Tried to play some games over the weekend, though, and was unable to connect to my other coworker that has it.

66
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:20,255
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh...

67
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:24,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm definitely digging this game and highly recommend you pick it up.

68
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:30,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's... Depending on where you go, it may be out yesterday or out on Tuesday.

69
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,021
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's an interesting story behind that, too.

70
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:38,183
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, so it's really fun.

71
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:41,765
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, graphics and sound are pretty good.

72
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:48,648
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, especially when you're comparing them to Earth Defense Force, you know, the first one, it's just night and day.

73
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:49,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

74
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:51,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's a little bit of slowdown.

75
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of your AI are kind of dumb, but they're actually pretty smart this time around.

76
00:04:55,672 --> 00:05:04,398
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually do a lot of work and they don't die quite often because you have a three-man team the entire time, whether it be with players or AI.

77
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,600
[SPEAKER_11]: And the different suits you can try out, those are kind of cool.

78
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,023
[SPEAKER_11]: But overall, it's just a great, great game and I really...

79
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:13,505
[SPEAKER_11]: I love playing.

80
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,187
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, I'll be playing some of it during the show.

81
00:05:16,188 --> 00:05:17,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's what I do.

82
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Be careful, though.

83
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,295
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to stream it anywhere to the internet because you might get arrested for that.

84
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:24,137
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll get into that later in the show.

85
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:29,458
[SPEAKER_10]: So how does this game outshine the original?

86
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:30,958
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it outshine the original?

87
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:38,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the original was really, really, really buggy and just really cheap, but it was fun because you're fighting a bunch of different things all at once.

88
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,440
[SPEAKER_11]: This one kind of ramps up everything.

89
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,381
[SPEAKER_11]: The graphics are better.

90
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:46,182
[SPEAKER_11]: The detail in the game, like destroying buildings and stuff, it's not just...

91
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:48,703
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

92
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

93
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:34,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Sound is actually really good in it.

94
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:38,504
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was just really action-packed.

95
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:43,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Just all the missions seem to like, oh, here, you're going to be attacked by these things.

96
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:45,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and now here's this thing coming in.

97
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:49,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and some dropships just came in, and they're going to be making your life hell.

98
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:55,090
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just really overwhelming, and yet without being too difficult.

99
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,151
[SPEAKER_11]: And although I am playing on the...

100
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:03,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Normal mode right now because I'm starting everything off normal then going through the hard and then the Inferno which is just insane.

101
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:11,173
[SPEAKER_11]: It is ramping up difficulty pretty fast, and that's the thing.

102
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:27,185
[SPEAKER_11]: In each mission, whereas the first game, the missions are pretty short, and they have like 73 of them, this one, the missions have different waypoints and different things going on, and they have the game broken up into chapters with different bits of the story going on.

103
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:29,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Like right now, this part I'm

104
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

105
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelongeradio.com, the ever-present fourth guest here on Orange Lounge Radio.

106
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:53,793
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, I played Earth Defense Force 2 at PAX East, and it really just reminded me of a next-gen version of the N64 game of Body Harvest.

107
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:56,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I sadly didn't like it as much as Loki likes it.

108
00:07:57,197 --> 00:07:58,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Breakman says, wait, what's going on here?

109
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki actually likes a game?

110
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,143
[SPEAKER_11]: I like games all the time.

111
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:23,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I look for this, I'm like... You're the only one that cares.

112
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:24,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

113
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:29,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you think you... And that happens in gaming sometimes.

114
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes we like a game that nobody else seems to like for unexplainable reasons.

115
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you so drawn to this freaking game?

116
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:35,857
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just fun.

117
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:38,079
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of taking games back to where...

118
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:40,668
[SPEAKER_11]: What the focus should be in any game.

119
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:47,275
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not about the great, great graphics or, you know, making sure everything's cinematic and has a great story.

120
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:49,858
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about being fun, and that's what this is.

121
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:52,781
[SPEAKER_11]: This is basically like a popcorn action flick or something like that.

122
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:56,325
[SPEAKER_11]: The story, yeah, there's somewhat of a story there, but who gives a shit?

123
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:56,726
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just...

124
00:08:57,967 --> 00:08:59,568
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

125
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:26,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, our intelligences have a better name for it, but that's what we're calling it.

126
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:37,020
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a part where I got picked up by this one dropship, and the pilot, he's just doing all the really typical...

127
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:52,569
[SPEAKER_11]: and yes, off to the left you'll see here there's a giant swarm of enemy ants attacking and you'll notice that we'll be cruising at an altitude of... It's kind of like Starship Troopers.

128
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,512
[SPEAKER_11]: It is very much like Starship Troopers, just without all the propaganda in there.

129
00:09:57,652 --> 00:09:58,632
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very...

130
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:00,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it's fun.

131
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:26,084
[SPEAKER_11]: and, you know, the spaceships, when they crash, they just kind of slowly sink through the ground and you could be in the path of one of them and it just clips right through you and stuff.

132
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:38,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this one, I mean, the actual ships, when they crash, I mean, they will take out buildings and they explode and they will possibly kill you if you're too close to it or, like, the enemy kind of spaceships are flying around.

133
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,713
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're shooting them and they get damaged enough, they will actually try to kamikaze into you and try to destroy you that way, but...

134
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:46,434
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, it's ridiculous fun.

135
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:47,134
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all it is.

136
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:48,475
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great game.

137
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,758
[SPEAKER_11]: And really, I mean, when you look at it in the month of July, there's not a lot coming out anyways.

138
00:10:53,818 --> 00:11:00,622
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're not a fan of football, then you're left with Harry Potter and Call of Juarez, you know, the cartel, which I hear is kind of terrible.

139
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:05,899
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, at least it's not Grand Theft Auto 4, which is all he ever plays.

140
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,299
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

141
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:06,680
[SPEAKER_10]: True that.

142
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited to hear Loki give an in-depth review to something else on the show for once.

143
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:13,782
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

144
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:20,584
[SPEAKER_10]: So Dan just walked in without a mic, interrupting the show, saying that Shadows of the Damned is fucking hilarious.

145
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:21,424
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a fun game.

146
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:25,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard this is kind of a... I haven't played it at all, but I've heard it's kind of fun too.

147
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:27,426
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing.

148
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:33,593
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a road trip movie game in hell, basically.

149
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:38,901
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like very Grindhouse-ish, but it's just, I don't know, insane.

150
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:41,397
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

151
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,062
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I bought a new headset.

152
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:12,449
[SPEAKER_10]: But I saw on the shelf, for $40, I saw a copy of Dance Dance Revolution on the Xbox 360, which is the brand new one.

153
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:15,111
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the reboot, quote unquote, of DDR.

154
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,873
[SPEAKER_10]: They had the brand new game and dance pad for $40.

155
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:19,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, well, you know...

156
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:21,356
[SPEAKER_10]: How bad could this possibly be?

157
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:23,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I like DDR.

158
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:26,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, OLR was built on DDR and all that, so why not?

159
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:27,499
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to buy this game.

160
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:33,742
[SPEAKER_10]: And I took it home and played it for a little while, and I was sad because it is horrible.

161
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:36,043
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a step backward for the genre.

162
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:41,086
[SPEAKER_10]: It is just a terrible, terrible version of DDR.

163
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:45,848
[SPEAKER_10]: And big parts of that I can really blame on the song list.

164
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:48,290
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

165
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,891
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

166
00:13:33,290 --> 00:14:00,737
[SPEAKER_10]: and then the song that just made me want to crinkle up my dance pad and throw it out the window Need You Now by Lady Antebellum that's right that slow jam song country western music somehow is appropriate for DDR and I was just like I died inside so the song list is terrible the interface is set up like a what no wonder it was 30 bucks it was 40 you overpaid what's that you overpaid

167
00:14:03,536 --> 00:14:03,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this.

168
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:08,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Islander in our chat says, Was Rob trying to sign his computer headphones with his butt?

169
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently.

170
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:10,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently.

171
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:16,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's not just the song list that's offensive, but the interface is just crap.

172
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, there's really nothing to it.

173
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,666
[SPEAKER_10]: The videos are just very generic videos.

174
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,347
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't even... Like, it's just... Like, they didn't even try.

175
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:30,892
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you put this game next to the Universe games on DDR, which, granted, at the time they came out were just kind of okay, now...

176
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:35,174
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't realize how good those fucking games were compared to this.

177
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:41,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I've got the most value out of this game using the dance pad because my old one was long destroyed.

178
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,481
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been using the dance pad to go back and play DDR Universe 1 and 2.

179
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:46,122
[SPEAKER_10]: That is what I've been using it for.

180
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:47,463
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

181
00:15:16,235 --> 00:15:20,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, go into our chatroom at chat.orangeonestrater.com.

182
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:21,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an issue with websites tonight.

183
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:25,739
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw says, so what Sky is trying to say, DDR360 is an abomination.

184
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:33,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and don't forget, this is the same game that's on the PS3, only it has move support, so whoopee, you get to wave your arms too.

185
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:35,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, but this has vision camera support.

186
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:39,445
[SPEAKER_10]: If it does, I don't know where it is, because I didn't see an option for it.

187
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Does the Kinect not read the same way as a vision cam?

188
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:42,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it should.

189
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:46,448
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's in there, I didn't find it, and I really didn't give a shit.

190
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,430
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's also on the Wii, and here's the hilarious part.

191
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,092
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look up videos of the Wii version, the Wii version actually kind of looks like the arcade versions.

192
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:58,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm saying the Wii version's interface looks better than the 360, and presumably PS3 versions.

193
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:01,795
[SPEAKER_10]: So you explain that one to me.

194
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:07,219
[SPEAKER_10]: All these weird combo things that are supposed to add points, I didn't even understand.

195
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,843
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the mode where you unlock stuff is the club mode, which is just non-stop mode.

196
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:14,944
[SPEAKER_10]: So that the songs come non-stop.

197
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:20,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And occasionally the difficulty will just randomly change in the song, or the arrows will move faster or slower.

198
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:24,791
[SPEAKER_10]: And then unexplainably, the way you unlock songs is you gain points.

199
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:32,213
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even fucking explain it.

200
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,794
[SPEAKER_10]: This game is just poopy poopy caw caw terrible.

201
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:38,376
[SPEAKER_10]: And it makes me sad as somebody who liked DDR so much.

202
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:42,357
[SPEAKER_10]: It is time for the Dance Dance Revolution franchise to be revoked from Konami.

203
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:45,538
[SPEAKER_10]: They no longer deserve to have that franchise based on this game.

204
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:52,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I truly believe that somehow some divine being needs to come into Konami.

205
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:55,840
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how this happens, but somehow there needs to be a legal decision.

206
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,162
[SPEAKER_10]: The Supreme Court should be involved in a 7-2 decision to revoke DDR from Konami.

207
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:02,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I realize they're a Japanese company.

208
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:03,402
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

209
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:07,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Somehow that needs to happen where they are no longer allowed to make Dance Dance Revolution.

210
00:17:07,964 --> 00:17:08,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Give it to me.

211
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:09,204
[SPEAKER_11]: I can take care of it.

212
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:16,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll clothe it, take it in, give it some shelter.

213
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:25,974
[SPEAKER_10]: So, anyhow, by the way, by the way, while I was playing that random non-stop mode, guess what awesome DDR jam started playing?

214
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:37,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, yeah, because, you know, sometimes there's, you know, there's these, there's the American songs you would expect to cross over, like some of the 80s classics, like, you know, Walk Like an Egyptian and so forth.

215
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,022
[SPEAKER_10]: But, oh man, I just couldn't believe my ears.

216
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:46,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I always thought this was such a great dance song, and I've always wanted to play this in DDR.

217
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:46,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the fall of

218
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:49,443
[SPEAKER_02]: What the crap is this?

219
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:50,444
Who is this?

220
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:52,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't listen to her.

221
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:05,880
[SPEAKER_10]: D.D.R.

222
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:29,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, hold me tight and we'll dance to Battlefield.

223
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:32,389
[SPEAKER_10]: We could do the four-player mode.

224
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold each other's hands.

225
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:35,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Step, step, step.

226
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:36,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Battlefield.

227
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:38,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Did that have, like, was it the quad?

228
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, why does love feel like a battlefield?

229
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:43,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, did that have the new pads with the eight arrows or some garbage?

230
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,483
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's the exact same fucking pad that came with Universe.

231
00:18:46,763 --> 00:18:50,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, clearly the surplus that got sent back to Konami headquarters was just packaged in this game.

232
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

233
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:00,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Breakman in our chatroom.

234
00:19:00,952 --> 00:19:02,252
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck is going on tonight?

235
00:19:02,332 --> 00:19:05,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki likes games, Sky is angry, and DarkSakura is quiet.

236
00:19:07,074 --> 00:19:08,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I like games all the time.

237
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:22,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you heard me talk negative about Saints Row the Third, Grand Theft Auto, Motorstorm Apocalypse, I'm sure there's other games in there that I liked.

238
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Sigh.

239
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:35,448
[SPEAKER_11]: So in our chatroom, we have... And, and, and, this goes back a few mixes ago, but what is the fucking abomination that is the new Dynamite Rave?

240
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:36,969
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck is that?

241
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:39,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not even gonna, I'm not even gonna try.

242
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,912
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have Frisbee, I'm sorry, was it Frisbee?

243
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:46,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Frisbee in our chatroom says, this is like Kelly Clarkson in Supernova PlayStation 2.

244
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:51,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm so glad you brought that up, because guess what another one of those awesome songs in the tracklist is?

245
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:00,789
[SPEAKER_10]: At least that's danceable.

246
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:01,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

247
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:09,911
[SPEAKER_10]: At least, like, that one didn't, I mean, lover or hater, at least you can kind of dance to that.

248
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Step, step, step, step, step, step, step.

249
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:14,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it has a beat.

250
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:15,952
[SPEAKER_10]: That one, not so terrible.

251
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:19,053
[SPEAKER_10]: But, come on.

252
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:25,454
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all right to have, like, one of those songs in there, but not...

253
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:26,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that.

254
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:29,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Songs like that to cross over to mainstream audience, that's fine.

255
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:31,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a problem with that song being in DDR.

256
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:37,068
[SPEAKER_10]: But like the Jordan Sparks and Leona Lewis, and I like Leona Lewis when I'm feeling sad.

257
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:41,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let me talk about a game that was a much better investment.

258
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:44,305
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, going on right now, Steam is having a sale.

259
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:47,246
[SPEAKER_10]: There's tons and tons of stuff that's discounted on Steam right now.

260
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:51,808
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the games I grabbed on sale was Bit.Trip Runner was $2.50 on Steam.

261
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:58,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Somehow I stepped into the Twilight Zone where that's the game I should have paid $40 for and DDR was worth about $2.50.

262
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:01,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Bit.Trip Runner is cool.

263
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:05,774
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this game because Bit.Trip beat...

264
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:11,038
[SPEAKER_10]: was neat, but it kind of, like, the shtick got old pretty fast, so the whole Pong thing.

265
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,820
[SPEAKER_10]: But I liked Bit.Trip Runner a lot.

266
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:26,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it really reminds me of an old-school 2600 game like what it would look like today, with the chiptune music, very simple controls, but a lot of that whole kind of repetition about how to learn to beat a level, and, you know, I...

267
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:34,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Even throwbacks to the classic Atari console with the whole bonus levels looking like pitfall complete with a noisy television.

268
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:40,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if you've ever tried to hook up on an old TV with the RF switch, you get that noise in there mixed with your game.

269
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:42,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I just loved the way it looked.

270
00:21:42,496 --> 00:21:44,256
[SPEAKER_10]: A Bit.Trip Runner was a great deal for $250.

271
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I played more of that game than I did the $40 DDR game.

272
00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:49,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

273
00:21:49,378 --> 00:21:51,639
[SPEAKER_10]: So Bit.Trip Runner, I endorse that game especially.

274
00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:13,721
[SPEAKER_10]: you could call it a music game because yeah it involves chiptunes but to me that's kind of the niche that makes it that much more awesome to me it's just like a classic Atari game what it would look like today just the chiptune element makes it attractive to those that maybe don't always care for the simplistic games if that makes sense so

275
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, anything else I played this week?

276
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:17,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I checked out some demos.

277
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:26,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't always like to review games based on the demos, but I'll quickly say I checked out the 32nd Hero Super Mega Neo Climax game on the Xbox 360.

278
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I own the PSP version of that, so I wanted to see what it looked like on 360.

279
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:34,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how the 360 has the completely different art modes that look completely different.

280
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:42,341
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the cel-shaded hand-drawn mode, which is pretty cool, but they also have the retro mode, which looks more like the PSP version or an 8-bit Nintendo classic.

281
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:44,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was pretty cool.

282
00:22:44,942 --> 00:23:10,807
[SPEAKER_10]: um let's see uh and um what was the other demo I played oh Galaga Legions DX I think I'm gonna buy that one that one was really cool that was kind of like Geometry Wars with the whole Pac-Man Championship Edition elements in it with the music and everything because by the same team if I'm not mistaking but it played a little more like Geometry Wars but it doesn't play like the old Galaga games at all so I thought that was kind of neat

283
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:15,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

284
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:19,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Ezam in our chatroom says, Bit.Trip is more rhythm puzzle than anything else.

285
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can see that.

286
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:23,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Rhythm puzzle, I think, is a good way to describe it.

287
00:23:25,475 --> 00:23:30,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, going into our chatroom, Blackwolf says, hey, that's not the Glee version, that sucks.

288
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:34,324
[SPEAKER_10]: And Breakman says, I hear Glee versions of songs every time I go to Target.

289
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:38,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's the other awesome music franchise that Konami's doing right now, Glee Karaoke Revolution.

290
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:39,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

291
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:39,990
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

292
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:43,854
[SPEAKER_11]: It sells for them, I guess.

293
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:46,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't know.

294
00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:48,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I don't know either.

295
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:57,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you all are dying to know more about the game that I'm giving away here on the program.

296
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:01,557
[SPEAKER_10]: At the top of the show I said, who wants to win my birthday present?

297
00:24:02,237 --> 00:24:03,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are going to give that away.

298
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:06,060
[SPEAKER_10]: But to tell us more about the birthday present...

299
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to call the person who bought it for me.

300
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:11,702
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is my significant other, Salacious Pop, that we're going to bring on the line.

301
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:12,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's right.

302
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:15,724
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm giving away the present that my significant other bought for me.

303
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:17,045
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to talk about why.

304
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:22,547
[SPEAKER_10]: He actually ordered a copy of Child of Eden for me online.

305
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:28,049
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to talk about why we are giving away, once it arrived, why we're giving it away.

306
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:29,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Salacious Pop, are you there?

307
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:29,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

308
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:30,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

309
00:24:30,895 --> 00:24:31,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I...

310
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:54,129
[SPEAKER_05]: decided that that was definitely what you needed to get for your birthday.

311
00:24:54,249 --> 00:25:04,011
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went on a hunt online to try and find it at a good price because I wasn't really prepared to, you know, drop the 60 bones or whatever it costs at Target.

312
00:25:04,812 --> 00:25:12,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So I checked out Amazon and a bunch of other sites and I just wasn't happy with, you know, how, what they were offering it for.

313
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:16,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So I ended up through Google Shopping, I ended up on eBay and

314
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:21,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure already some people in the studio might know where this story is going.

315
00:25:22,451 --> 00:25:32,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I found a lot of retailers with tens of thousands of feedback positive score that I could have got it from, but I found this one sort of dog and pony show seller with a feedback score of five or six.

316
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:43,439
[SPEAKER_05]: and selling Child of Eden and a bunch of other games like Halo Reach and Madden 11 and a bunch of other stuff new shrink-wrapped in America for what I thought was a good price.

317
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:46,721
[SPEAKER_10]: And at least it was a feedback of one or higher.

318
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,422
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't some new eBay account, right?

319
00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:54,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was five, which is still pretty low for the fact they had like 80 auctions running at once.

320
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, all right, I am going to give this a shot.

321
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:01,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And I sell a ton of stuff on eBay and I take it very seriously.

322
00:26:01,164 --> 00:26:06,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I kind of projected the fact that I'm a legit EJ seller onto this stranger person.

323
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:08,109
[SPEAKER_05]: So I buy it.

324
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:15,654
[SPEAKER_05]: And three days later, when I get my tracking number, I see that for one, I notice that they closed their account.

325
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:19,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've unregistered from eBay and their feedback score is now zero.

326
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:24,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And I look at the tracking number and it is from China.

327
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:32,104
[SPEAKER_05]: and anyone who ever orders anything on eBay knows that if your item comes from China, it is a counterfeit.

328
00:26:32,164 --> 00:26:38,529
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bootleg because the piracy market over in China and Taiwan is millions and millions of dollars of counterfeit titles.

329
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:43,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, well, shit, it's going to take this game three weeks to get to me and it's obviously fake.

330
00:26:45,074 --> 00:26:47,716
[SPEAKER_05]: So it arrived on Thursday.

331
00:26:48,197 --> 00:26:50,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I open it and here's the punchline.

332
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is a counterfeit.

333
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, it's

334
00:26:53,982 --> 00:26:58,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised at how good the quality is, but it's not good enough.

335
00:26:58,824 --> 00:27:03,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you can tell, like, wow, they printed this on a very high-quality, expensive color laser printer.

336
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:05,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it definitely looks like a color copy.

337
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:12,811
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's very high-quality, but if you look closely, you can just kind of see that ink, inkjet little dotting.

338
00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:13,391
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean.

339
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:16,893
[SPEAKER_10]: If you ever look at an original and an inkjet side-by-side, you can tell the difference.

340
00:27:18,157 --> 00:27:27,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so obviously it's a counterfeit, and if you look at the underside of the disc, you can see that it's like a DVD-R that they just bought a huge spindle of them.

341
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:37,106
[SPEAKER_05]: But the game wasn't even a counterfeit Child of Eden, it was a counterfeit PAL edition, so they bootlegged the European version, of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

342
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:41,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a bootlegged game from China...

343
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:45,577
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the PAL version, Whammy number two.

344
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:48,820
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the wrong counterfeit game from what I ordered, Whammy number three.

345
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is some Yakety Sax, Benny Hill-themed shit right there.

346
00:27:53,324 --> 00:28:02,652
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to give, and before we had the call tonight, I asked you to pick a number from one, two, of all the people in chat who said that they wanted my 360 game.

347
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:03,893
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to congratulate...

348
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:17,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Kaijudo won a copy, bootleg copy of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood PAL edition on the Xbox 360 signed by DarkSakura's butt.

349
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:21,292
[SPEAKER_10]: My birthday present.

350
00:28:22,173 --> 00:28:25,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I care about the listeners, I am giving away my birthday present.

351
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:31,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I opened a case for it on eBay and I'm confident that I'm gonna get my money back.

352
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:32,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

353
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:40,369
[SPEAKER_05]: The price that I got it for was sort of in that nebulous, too good to be true, but I could see someone selling the game for cheap at this amount.

354
00:28:40,748 --> 00:29:08,482
[SPEAKER_11]: so even if I get screwed over which I doubt I will it's not a horrible heartbreaking amount of money but come on eBay it's not completely unreasonable for someone to sell stuff for cheap for example I take games sometimes that I get for free and I just don't want them and I don't really care what I get for them so I start the auction at one penny and whatever they end at that's what they sell for so a lot of times you know I think Brink was one that went recently it went for $24 so it's not unreasonable for that to happen

355
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:10,547
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

356
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:35,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I sold them on the adult section of eBay for a penny and some of them only went for $10 and they were perfectly brand new retail good items.

357
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:38,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So I absolutely understand how that could happen.

358
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:49,018
[SPEAKER_10]: So you thought maybe you'd find somebody like you who was just giving away their excess promo copies of Child of Eden but unfortunately you got a PAL copy that's not even real of Assassin's Creed.

359
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Of a game that I didn't order, yes.

360
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:50,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

361
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:53,903
[SPEAKER_10]: So TigerClaw in our chatroom says, what's the moral of the story?

362
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:55,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't order from Amazon.

363
00:29:56,124 --> 00:29:57,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I think you got the moral mixed up.

364
00:29:57,746 --> 00:29:59,667
[SPEAKER_10]: It's don't order from eBay.

365
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:06,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Order from a, quote, legit store like Amazon or Best Buy or Fry's or whatever the hell you want.

366
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:10,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Thankfully, even though PayPal is evil, usually...

367
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:16,350
[SPEAKER_11]: WTF, if I would ever try to give away a gift from my girl, she would fucking kill me.

368
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you going to fucking kill me, SalaciousPop?

369
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:43,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've found an even better solution to get you your Child of Eden fix, and I get to play it too.

370
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:45,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So no, I'm not too heartbroken over this.

371
00:30:45,414 --> 00:30:47,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can go ahead and share what we ended up doing instead.

372
00:30:47,656 --> 00:30:51,500
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually kind of, in an ironic way, it's actually kind of funny this worked out this way.

373
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:58,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a listener of OLR, I'm trying to think of his name.

374
00:30:58,548 --> 00:30:58,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Nicholas Austin.

375
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:17,389
[SPEAKER_05]: his screen name Miklatov called us today Miklatov told us that on BestBuy.com or the brick and mortar store if you have one nearby for today and tomorrow Kinect games are two for one so we picked up Child of Eden and

376
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:22,264
[SPEAKER_05]: and a fitness game that looked like a fitness game that wasn't actually horrible.

377
00:31:23,024 --> 00:31:26,486
[SPEAKER_05]: We got both of those, so that's your birthday present are those two games.

378
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:28,107
[SPEAKER_10]: So I ended up getting a two-for-one deal out of it.

379
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:28,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Which fitness game?

380
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:29,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the Year Fitness.

381
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:30,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's not bad.

382
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:32,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because, no, trust me, we looked.

383
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:35,171
[SPEAKER_10]: We're like, okay, Zumba Fitness is the one that's selling really well in Europe.

384
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:36,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Went to Metacritic.

385
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,733
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like 40-something.

386
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:41,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless you like Latin dancing, and I'm talking about Latin female dancing.

387
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:42,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I do like Latin female dancing.

388
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:43,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

389
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was.

390
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:50,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Your Shape Fitness Evolved, which I think is like a 74 on Metacritic for a fitness game.

391
00:31:50,022 --> 00:31:50,602
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty good.

392
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,122
[SPEAKER_11]: That was pretty good.

393
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:57,384
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the sequel coming out this year, but I mean... We just kind of went to Metacritic and picked the one with the best score, and that's the one we went with.

394
00:31:58,024 --> 00:32:03,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we were like, well, let's get a fitness game, because I've actually kind of been into fitness and all that stuff lately, like trying to walk more, eat better.

395
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:07,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I've lost seven pounds in the past two months, so I kind of want to keep that trend going without having to join a gym.

396
00:32:07,406 --> 00:32:09,327
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it'd be cool.

397
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:16,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Breakman in chat says, so basically someone wins Sky's coffee table drink coaster.

398
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:18,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I never said it was a good game.

399
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:20,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you think I was giving it away?

400
00:32:21,888 --> 00:32:24,389
[SPEAKER_10]: But Kaijudo says, I will put that game up on a plaque.

401
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:27,111
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm glad someone won it who will appreciate it.

402
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:28,792
[SPEAKER_10]: So congratulations once again.

403
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:39,038
[SPEAKER_10]: You win my birthday bootleg PAL copy of the wrong fucking game, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, signed by myself, Loki, and DarkSakura's butt.

404
00:32:40,217 --> 00:33:08,839
[SPEAKER_11]: and uh I think doesn't Loki probably has a system somewhere that would play it that was actually my first reaction I'm like one of Loki's like 10 360s could probably play this game I don't have 10 360s no my my JTAG which which by the way I broke this week but I will be fixing it um yes I would probably be able to play that but Loki I've decided I'm gonna give it to a listener instead in fact uh Dan's JTAG out there probably could play it all right well oh well

405
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:12,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Salacious Pop, while we have you on, anything else you want to share with the listeners?

406
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:17,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that really insane Steam sale that's running, I think, all week.

407
00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:18,710
[SPEAKER_05]: People need to get on that.

408
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Some great stuff on there.

409
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:20,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, indeed.

410
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,913
[SPEAKER_10]: And win tickets.

411
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:24,095
[SPEAKER_10]: And join the OLR group while you're on there.

412
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:25,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray.

413
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:26,657
[SPEAKER_10]: More information at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

414
00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:27,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, take care.

415
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Salacious Pop.

416
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:29,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

417
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:58,819
[SPEAKER_10]: and it really is one of those situations where it's the thought that counts like I just laughed it off like I kind of knew he was getting me Child of Eden because when I tried to buy it in the store he's like don't you want to wait till after your birthday to buy any big purchases like that you know that whole little thing so I kind of knew that was coming but you know the story behind it is even better than just the game showing up on the doorstep you know and you even said ahead of time that you felt or that Alan felt something like that might happen

418
00:33:59,133 --> 00:33:59,894
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

419
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:17,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Team Fortress 2

420
00:34:36,884 --> 00:35:06,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Or Portal 2, your copies on PS3 that work on Steam, what have you We actually do have our own little Steam community And you can see that on our website, orangelauntrader.com On the left hand side is a little button for Steam In the extended play section Steamcommunity.com slash groups slash OLR So there you go Alright, let's get into tonight's news There actually is a lot of gaming news too this week So let's get right into it Loki, start us off, what's going on in the news?

421
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we talked a little bit about this on our tease with Bobby.

422
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:14,672
[SPEAKER_11]: But Resident Evil Mercenary 3D just came out last week.

423
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:19,493
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was a big controversy over the fact that Capcom decided, hey, guess what?

424
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:22,993
[SPEAKER_11]: You know that save game data that you have on there?

425
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:24,674
[SPEAKER_11]: It cannot be reset.

426
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:30,255
[SPEAKER_11]: So, for example, say you get really far in the game and you decide to sell it.

427
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:36,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the next person that buys it, they're stuck with your save game and having everything being unlocked.

428
00:35:38,397 --> 00:36:04,927
[SPEAKER_11]: it was funny because actually at one point GameStop and a lot of the major retailers out there were not going to be taking the game in as a trade I guess they've reversed their policy on that but they're saying upon further review of the process with our publisher partner Capcom GameStop will resume taking trades on the game effective Wednesday June 29th makes me wonder a couple things here one

429
00:36:06,912 --> 00:36:09,398
[SPEAKER_11]: So, GameStop probably bitched to Capcom.

430
00:36:11,994 --> 00:36:13,995
[SPEAKER_11]: GameStop Employee GameStop Employee GameStop Employee

431
00:36:37,317 --> 00:36:40,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Overseas, though, it says retailer HMV has ceased taking trades in for the title.

432
00:36:41,402 --> 00:36:44,786
[SPEAKER_11]: EB Games Australia has also stopped stocking the game altogether.

433
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:52,555
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, they're just saying if, you know, EB Games, I guess, if you would like to purchase it with us, then of course we will sell it to you.

434
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:57,658
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be a case of an order with our store.

435
00:36:57,978 --> 00:37:03,501
[SPEAKER_11]: We made the tough decision to remove it from sale because we had everybody's best interest in mind.

436
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:10,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't feel that it's fair that you guys would be paying $60 Australian for what is essentially a one-use game.

437
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:22,796
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, let's get back to the root problem here, because amongst the whole 9th anniversary show and the fact that this news kind of came out on a Sunday last week, we kind of overlooked this story.

438
00:37:24,337 --> 00:37:28,721
[SPEAKER_10]: In what fucking universe was this a good game design idea to not reset the save file?

439
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:34,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I get the defense as the whole, well, it's like an arcade game, and...

440
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:58,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying that is the defense I'm not saying I understand it but that is the whole like well it's it's like an arcade game and it's not detrimental so what like I hate it when game companies try to tell me what I want as a gamer because that's what the gamers want no I'm telling you that's not what I want I do sometimes like to reset my games well here's the thing about I did it on Final Fantasy 13 a few weeks ago

441
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:00,820
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like an arcade game, okay?

442
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,001
[SPEAKER_11]: That's your defense then?

443
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:04,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Arcade cabinets I can reset the goddamn high score.

444
00:38:04,964 --> 00:38:08,188
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, Capcom arcade games I can reset the high score on.

445
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,251
[SPEAKER_11]: So, where's your logic there?

446
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:13,823
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't make sense.

447
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:35,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, clearly, somebody made this decision, and I think this decision absolutely was made to impact the used market, because somebody made a conscious decision not to let the game save to the 3DS card, internal memory, like all the other freaking 3DS games do, where if you wanted to reset your data, oh, it's as easy as deleting the file.

448
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:37,122
[SPEAKER_10]: How easy is that?

449
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:40,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody made the conscious decision, no, we don't want to do that.

450
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:44,939
[SPEAKER_10]: We're specifically moving it to the cart and not making it deletable.

451
00:38:47,688 --> 00:38:55,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet now they've come up with all this crap to kind of backtalk their way into how that was a great decision and it's where the game industry is going.

452
00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:56,536
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really what you wanted.

453
00:38:56,696 --> 00:38:57,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's what we wanted.

454
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:00,539
[SPEAKER_11]: You wanted an arcade experience, didn't you?

455
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:06,084
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I didn't really want to play the Mercenary missions from 4 and 5 ported to the 3DS.

456
00:39:06,284 --> 00:39:08,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like, I don't know, maybe a new Resident Evil game.

457
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:09,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, but guess what?

458
00:39:09,967 --> 00:39:14,691
[SPEAKER_11]: You can play the demo for the new Resident Evil game on this game itself.

459
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:14,991
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

460
00:39:16,696 --> 00:39:17,957
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess there's something to it.

461
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:24,863
[SPEAKER_11]: But once again, you know, I mean, to be fair, it didn't get very good reviews because apparently the game wasn't that great.

462
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:28,026
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, you know, I don't really consider a big loss.

463
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:32,911
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting, though, because this news story yet has people talking about it.

464
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:41,899
[SPEAKER_10]: And despite the fact it was a mediocre game that probably, you know, the Resident Evil fans would have been, yay, but most other people would have been like, bring on the other 3DS games.

465
00:39:42,942 --> 00:39:49,004
[SPEAKER_11]: It's another entry in the long line of bad DRM decisions from Capcom.

466
00:39:49,404 --> 00:39:55,266
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's not, oh, this game needs to be online at all times in order for it to work even in single player.

467
00:39:56,266 --> 00:40:03,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Or in games that don't even have a multiplayer component, oh, and then the PlayStation Network goes down and their game stops working for a month or whatever.

468
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:07,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so I'm being corrected by the chat room as tends to happen sometimes on this show.

469
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:12,292
[SPEAKER_10]: BlackWolf in our chat says, actually Rob, none of the 3DS games I have saved to the SD card.

470
00:40:12,692 --> 00:40:15,953
[SPEAKER_10]: They all save to the 3DS card, but you can do data management.

471
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:20,875
[SPEAKER_10]: The only things that save to the SD card are the street pass and maybe data that won't fit on the card.

472
00:40:21,235 --> 00:40:28,738
[SPEAKER_10]: So fine, I just haven't noticed because there hasn't really been that big RPG 3DS game that I've wanted to reset the data on so far.

473
00:40:29,474 --> 00:40:35,757
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, when all is said and done, would I probably really want to reset the data on a game like this?

474
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:36,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not.

475
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:37,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Me, personally.

476
00:40:38,178 --> 00:40:38,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not.

477
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,279
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably wouldn't have noticed this if it hadn't been called out.

478
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,241
[SPEAKER_10]: But what ticks me off about it is this whole, we all see what you're doing.

479
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:48,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Quit trying to make excuses to say otherwise.

480
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:52,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it's very obvious why they're doing this.

481
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:53,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop lying.

482
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,566
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because they don't want to piss off the fans.

483
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:59,609
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't want to piss off the fans because they're trying to do this to save some money.

484
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:04,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Then they are assuming that their fans are stupid and you should be offended.

485
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:06,074
[SPEAKER_11]: And really, how much money are they saving?

486
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:10,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this game itself is probably going to sell, what, maybe 400,000 units?

487
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:13,519
[SPEAKER_11]: And that right there is a really...

488
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Generous estimate.

489
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, 400,000 units in the lifetime of this game.

490
00:41:20,601 --> 00:41:29,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we're talking like, you know, maybe a few 10,000 copies or whatever that they're going to lose out sales on because someone's going to buy it used.

491
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:38,225
[SPEAKER_11]: And, okay, say like 25% of those copies are going to sell for used or something like that.

492
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:42,550
[SPEAKER_11]: How many people are you really turning away from putting this feature on there?

493
00:41:42,911 --> 00:41:45,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, what, maybe let's just say 10,000 of those people.

494
00:41:45,614 --> 00:41:52,744
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's such a minor, minor, minor number compared to, you know, people are just not going to give a shit or they just won't buy your game.

495
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:53,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

496
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:06,761
[SPEAKER_10]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says Hey, this is an investment opportunity Buy 5 copies this week, save them for 3 years and sell them as unopened on eBay for $100 each.

497
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:11,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Profit I don't know if that will work if the game is only kind of mediocre

498
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:15,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, however, I say at the end of the day, vote with your wallet.

499
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,851
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really what it boils down to.

500
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:21,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, to be honest, I probably wouldn't have bought this game anyway, but I especially wouldn't have bought it.

501
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:25,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, if I was on the fence, I would have said, no, I don't really want to support this methodology.

502
00:42:25,597 --> 00:42:29,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, see, that's what was going through my head the whole time, is why the crap would I buy that game?

503
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,261
[SPEAKER_07]: There hasn't been a good Resident Evil game since 3.

504
00:42:32,321 --> 00:42:34,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, come on, 4?

505
00:42:34,983 --> 00:42:35,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't like it.

506
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:39,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, oh my god, that's one of the best GameCube games ever.

507
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:39,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Period.

508
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:41,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I realize everybody has their own opinion.

509
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:42,148
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

510
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:44,729
[SPEAKER_10]: But I cannot agree with you.

511
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:46,450
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite to this day is still 2.

512
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:49,432
[SPEAKER_10]: 4 was, like, one of the best games they had.

513
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:50,973
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really liked Code Veronica.

514
00:42:50,993 --> 00:42:51,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Period.

515
00:42:52,514 --> 00:42:52,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

516
00:42:52,995 --> 00:42:53,315
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

517
00:42:53,795 --> 00:42:56,697
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would be with you that 5 was not what it could have been.

518
00:42:56,717 --> 00:42:57,197
[SPEAKER_10]: No, 5 was not.

519
00:42:57,838 --> 00:42:58,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

520
00:42:59,238 --> 00:43:00,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, vote with your wallet, kids.

521
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:01,660
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really what it boils down to.

522
00:43:02,532 --> 00:43:21,008
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, now, speaking of fun money-related decisions and what you support and what you don't, where the industry is going, last week on the show we talked about the impending Supreme Court decision, and I gotta admit, we were a little bit in the negative defeatist realm last week where we were pretty sure that it was gonna come out and

523
00:43:21,408 --> 00:43:22,109
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

524
00:43:46,144 --> 00:43:59,660
[SPEAKER_10]: So in Brown vs. Entertainment Merchants Association, which used to be Schwarzenegger vs. Entertainment Merchants Association, but we've had a new governor since the law first went into effect, it was reversed in a 7-2 decision.

525
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:00,281
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

526
00:44:01,903 --> 00:44:02,784
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

527
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:23,468
[SPEAKER_10]: We understand why there might be a law, just this wasn't really the way to do it.

528
00:44:23,548 --> 00:44:26,128
[SPEAKER_10]: The way you're defining offensive here is a little vague.

529
00:44:26,148 --> 00:44:26,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Things like that.

530
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:31,689
[SPEAKER_10]: So is this all going to be said and done and over with?

531
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:33,790
[SPEAKER_10]: I guarantee you it's not.

532
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:41,551
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, there was some reaction this week from Leland Yee, who was the state senator who originally drafted this whole bill in the first place.

533
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:45,292
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a Democrat representing San Francisco.

534
00:44:45,932 --> 00:45:05,479
[SPEAKER_10]: and he put together a whole little statement that said that the ruling of the Supreme Court puts the interests of corporate America before the interests of children as a result of their decision Walmart and the video game industry will continue to make billions of dollars at the expense of our kids mental health and the safety of our community good god

535
00:45:05,879 --> 00:45:09,500
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you read the terms... He clearly didn't read the syllabus.

536
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Because... And I read the whole thing.

537
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,721
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes in there to say that the research that they used was inherently flawed.

538
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:33,764
[SPEAKER_07]: And that actually the same researchers who were trying to make the claim that violent video games were harmful to children said also television, movies, books, Saturday morning cartoons...

539
00:45:34,724 --> 00:45:35,925
[SPEAKER_07]: were all equally harmful.

540
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:40,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, on top of all that, he's saying it's in the interest of children.

541
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:51,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, children aren't able to purchase, I mean, as it is with the company policies, they're unable to purchase these games in these stores.

542
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,723
[SPEAKER_11]: And last time I checked, you know,

543
00:45:54,264 --> 00:45:54,844
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

544
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:29,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, these same parents, keep in mind, are encouraging their kids to go play high school football and participate in sports where far more injuries occur as opposed to those related to video games.

545
00:46:30,215 --> 00:46:30,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And deaths.

546
00:46:30,795 --> 00:46:31,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, don't forget deaths.

547
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:42,117
[SPEAKER_10]: So, by the way, Leland Yee, at the end of the day, basically said he's going to try again because there were a couple people on the fence.

548
00:46:42,137 --> 00:46:42,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, of course.

549
00:46:42,818 --> 00:46:44,700
[SPEAKER_11]: You haven't wasted enough taxpayer money yet.

550
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:45,721
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like this.

551
00:46:46,101 --> 00:46:48,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so you guys lost the case, Leland Yee.

552
00:46:49,165 --> 00:46:52,027
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're going to pony up that $2 million that we wasted on this?

553
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:54,230
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what else is very interesting about this?

554
00:46:54,510 --> 00:47:01,257
[SPEAKER_10]: You hear a lot about partisan politics in this nation and this whole Republican, Democrat stuff going on here.

555
00:47:01,357 --> 00:47:05,882
[SPEAKER_10]: This really is one of those things that doesn't seem to fall on one party or the other.

556
00:47:06,643 --> 00:47:09,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, a Democrat wrote it, but then when you look at who

557
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:15,493
[SPEAKER_10]: and the Supreme Court decided to dissent against the majority and actually side with Leland Yee.

558
00:47:15,953 --> 00:47:21,019
[SPEAKER_10]: One of those justices was Clarence Thomas, who was a Herbert Walker Bush nominee to the court.

559
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:24,383
[SPEAKER_10]: The other one being Breyer, a Clinton appointee to the court.

560
00:47:24,443 --> 00:47:27,066
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't partisan either, which is interesting.

561
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:35,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's so many issues in America where it's like, you know, it's a Republican issue or it's a Democrat issue, but this is one of those things that's really all over the map.

562
00:47:35,157 --> 00:47:36,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Partisan politics is bullshit anyway.

563
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:41,599
[SPEAKER_11]: It's trying to add regulation for something that there's already regulation for.

564
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:49,842
[SPEAKER_11]: I suggest that they go in there and we need to enact some sort of force that'll go out there and stop people from committing laws.

565
00:47:50,262 --> 00:47:51,062
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

566
00:48:19,549 --> 00:48:38,901
[SPEAKER_07]: and and that you know they understand parents have a right to want a little bit more assistance from the government and which I think is bullshit but um the whole point is that it's basically the government shall not step in on your personal liberties we've already had enough of that going on this is where we draw the line

567
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,321
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand the whole needing for education for the ESRB ratings.

568
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:48,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody need education for the movie MPA ratings?

569
00:48:48,203 --> 00:48:51,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never seen somebody go, oh, I don't know what an R-rated movie has in it.

570
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:55,285
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, does that ever confuse anybody?

571
00:48:55,345 --> 00:48:58,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I see no point to this excuse anyways.

572
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:04,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, as a parent, I don't understand English on the back of my box that says violence, nudity.

573
00:49:04,728 --> 00:49:06,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Does this game contain violence and nudity?

574
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:08,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, it says right there that it does.

575
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:08,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean,

576
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:17,110
[SPEAKER_07]: But the issue, and I'm not even going to say this flat out as a parental issue, I'm going to say this as an essentially American issue, people are fucking lazy.

577
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:19,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody wants to think for themselves.

578
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:25,412
[SPEAKER_07]: They want everything handed to them on a plate that says, here, here's everything spelled out for you, so now it's easy.

579
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:27,592
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take out the hard work part of it.

580
00:49:27,692 --> 00:49:31,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you see the part, did you see the whole thing being discussed on the Daily Show?

581
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:34,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you see that whole clip of Jon Stewart talking about it?

582
00:49:34,053 --> 00:49:36,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched some of it in the moment that he said he supported it, I left the room.

583
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:37,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I...

584
00:49:38,454 --> 00:50:04,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't think I didn't get that impression necessarily supported it it sure seemed like it watching it but then there was part of me that was like it was very tongue-in-cheek like is this kind of like tongue-in-cheek onion style humor that maybe we're just not getting because what amazed me about it is as he was talking about the bill and you know these horrible games that would be sold yet he was showing clips uncensored of the games on his program that I could just turn on my television and watch and

585
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:06,632
[SPEAKER_08]: But granted, primetime.

586
00:50:07,232 --> 00:50:12,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, surely this is just highbrow humor that I'm not getting.

587
00:50:12,715 --> 00:50:14,195
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think he was actually serious.

588
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:29,022
[SPEAKER_11]: If you knew nothing about the issue at all and you were just presented this, oh, hey, there was a law that was going to ban these violent games from ending up in children's laps, then you could see, oh, well, why did they vote against that?

589
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:32,544
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that doesn't make any sense why they would vote against these violent games going in kids' laps.

590
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:40,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Until you explain that, hey, there's already regulation in place, you know, done by these retailers where they're not selling this stuff to people.

591
00:50:40,614 --> 00:50:46,723
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's also not this sort of regulation, you know, done by the law for any other type of media, including TV.

592
00:50:47,103 --> 00:50:47,364
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

593
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's the point that he forgot to point out.

594
00:50:51,688 --> 00:50:59,475
[SPEAKER_11]: But because, you know, it's more interesting to have, you know, this violent imagery on screen and him going, you know, just because that gets him.

595
00:50:59,996 --> 00:51:09,825
[SPEAKER_07]: One point that Dan brought up was that now this might set a precedent for people to basically sue a company for not selling the game like when they've sent their kid in to go buy it.

596
00:51:10,425 --> 00:51:14,289
[SPEAKER_07]: And the company says no, but it is part of the business that you have.

597
00:51:14,429 --> 00:51:14,809
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

598
00:51:33,206 --> 00:51:35,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Violent enough to fall under this, that's the problem with it.

599
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Go into our chatroom at chat.org.com.

600
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:07,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Salacious Pop is actually commenting in our chatroom right now and saying, Loki, there's actually two movies where that happened, and I think talking about some of the violence.

601
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:12,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which was PG, made parents flip their shit.

602
00:52:12,372 --> 00:52:14,153
[SPEAKER_10]: It's why PG-13 was invented.

603
00:52:14,493 --> 00:52:15,053
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

604
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:18,054
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw faces melting when I was a kid, and I turned out okay.

605
00:52:19,214 --> 00:52:19,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that scene?

606
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,412
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in Pee-wee's Big Adventure.

607
00:52:41,932 --> 00:52:42,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God!

608
00:52:43,954 --> 00:52:46,216
[SPEAKER_10]: When he gets in the truck with Large Marge.

609
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And she does this.

610
00:52:47,817 --> 00:52:48,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.

611
00:52:48,718 --> 00:52:49,378
[SPEAKER_10]: She's telling the story.

612
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,541
[SPEAKER_10]: On a night just like this.

613
00:52:53,242 --> 00:52:53,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

614
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:56,485
[SPEAKER_10]: And then she goes, and it looked like this.

615
00:52:56,505 --> 00:52:56,805
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

616
00:52:57,345 --> 00:52:59,788
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole claymation thing, right?

617
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:04,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Little kids bursting into tears across the country, scarred for life.

618
00:53:05,554 --> 00:53:07,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I still can't watch that scene.

619
00:53:07,736 --> 00:53:09,678
[SPEAKER_10]: It's why we are afraid of truckers.

620
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:11,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Our generation is afraid of truckers.

621
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,961
[SPEAKER_07]: My daddy was a trucker.

622
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:14,903
[SPEAKER_10]: He actually still is.

623
00:53:16,244 --> 00:53:16,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

624
00:53:35,743 --> 00:53:37,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not find the damn picture, Rob.

625
00:53:37,383 --> 00:53:37,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

626
00:53:37,824 --> 00:53:38,024
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

627
00:53:38,044 --> 00:53:38,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not finding the picture.

628
00:53:38,724 --> 00:53:40,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure the movie was rated PG.

629
00:53:41,325 --> 00:53:41,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Where was it?

630
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:42,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was.

631
00:53:43,885 --> 00:53:46,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Check IMDb.

632
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,347
[SPEAKER_10]: See, look, I can't figure out what this freaking movie is rated.

633
00:53:49,367 --> 00:53:50,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, should it be this typical?

634
00:53:50,307 --> 00:53:50,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, IMDb.

635
00:53:51,087 --> 00:53:51,587
[SPEAKER_10]: IMDb.

636
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:58,089
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, actually, there was one movie that I saw when I was a kid, and it was rated R movie, and I went to see it with my uncle.

637
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:02,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen tons of rated R movies when I was a little kid.

638
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:03,558
[SPEAKER_10]: It's PG.

639
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:04,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, IMDB.

640
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the only movie rated R that ever scared me.

641
00:54:09,283 --> 00:54:11,504
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, today, you will laugh at this.

642
00:54:11,644 --> 00:54:11,885
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

643
00:54:11,985 --> 00:54:12,925
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Poltergeist 3.

644
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:14,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

645
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:16,308
[SPEAKER_07]: That I was afraid of mirrors for like a week.

646
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:17,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen it?

647
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:18,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

648
00:54:19,611 --> 00:54:20,772
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

649
00:54:39,311 --> 00:54:40,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at any Disney movie.

650
00:54:41,252 --> 00:54:42,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, okay, Tarzan.

651
00:54:43,432 --> 00:54:45,253
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all seen that Disney movie, right?

652
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:46,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

653
00:54:46,814 --> 00:54:52,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Spoiler alert, the main villain dies in the movie by being strangled to death.

654
00:54:53,656 --> 00:54:57,777
[SPEAKER_07]: By falling down with vines wrapped around his neck, with his neck broken.

655
00:54:58,217 --> 00:54:59,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I remember seeing that.

656
00:54:59,298 --> 00:55:00,678
[SPEAKER_07]: And they show the silhouette of it.

657
00:55:00,858 --> 00:55:03,139
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, this is very violent for kids.

658
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:05,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Or how about Snow White?

659
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:11,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Almost all Disney villains die by falling off a cliff and then you just see that little poof of smoke that rises from the bottom.

660
00:55:11,285 --> 00:55:12,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Or how about Snow White?

661
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:17,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Movie from, what was it, 1947, wasn't it?

662
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:27,217
[SPEAKER_07]: The queen is the old witch trying to push the boulder down the hill and instead lightning strikes her, she falls off the cliff and the boulder lands on her.

663
00:55:27,237 --> 00:55:28,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

664
00:55:28,818 --> 00:55:29,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

665
00:55:29,479 --> 00:55:29,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

666
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:37,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, lots of people in chat talking about the Large Marge scene and how actually there were a lot of people that apparently were scared by that.

667
00:55:37,225 --> 00:55:39,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Dungeon Buster mentions the death of Optimus Prime.

668
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:40,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

669
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:42,929
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope I'm saying this right.

670
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:48,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Rade, or maybe that's Raid, Rade says, Oh Jesus, Large Marge, that scarred me for life.

671
00:55:48,594 --> 00:55:50,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Breakman says, Yeah, that was scary because it was so unexpected.

672
00:55:51,075 --> 00:55:52,897
[SPEAKER_10]: And Frisbee says, I still can't watch that.

673
00:55:54,386 --> 00:55:55,166
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're not alone.

674
00:55:55,487 --> 00:55:58,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, SSJ100 Matt provides a YouTube link if you want to see that.

675
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:00,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Zether, another one here.

676
00:56:00,449 --> 00:56:03,050
[SPEAKER_10]: The boat scene in Willy Wonka scared me shitless.

677
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, that movie was fucked up.

678
00:56:05,531 --> 00:56:05,972
[SPEAKER_10]: It was.

679
00:56:07,092 --> 00:56:07,873
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like the new one.

680
00:56:08,473 --> 00:56:09,914
[SPEAKER_10]: The old one is far more fucked up.

681
00:56:09,954 --> 00:56:15,456
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate them both, but the old one, I was actually a child when I saw the old one, and it was kind of fucked up.

682
00:56:15,556 --> 00:56:16,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a little afraid.

683
00:56:16,317 --> 00:56:19,098
[SPEAKER_10]: When she's a bad egg and she falls through the chute and all these...

684
00:56:19,438 --> 00:56:31,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I want the world, I want the whole world There is no way of knowing where exactly we are going I was afraid of Gene Wilder when I was little For a while For a while

685
00:56:32,614 --> 00:56:33,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Our whole generation.

686
00:56:33,554 --> 00:56:36,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, where do you think... Why are we not more screwed up?

687
00:56:37,735 --> 00:56:38,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And yet we all turned out fine.

688
00:56:38,955 --> 00:56:39,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we turned out fine.

689
00:56:40,395 --> 00:56:44,456
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying that kids should be subjected to this violence.

690
00:56:44,476 --> 00:56:44,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, come on.

691
00:56:45,016 --> 00:56:46,696
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that's a parent's decision to make.

692
00:56:46,716 --> 00:56:49,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Star Trek V in the theater and I'm not fucked up.

693
00:56:49,177 --> 00:56:49,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was awful.

694
00:56:49,937 --> 00:56:58,418
[SPEAKER_11]: I think any parent that's saying, I didn't know what this game was rated or I didn't know that this game had violence in it or I didn't know this is just retarded.

695
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:01,099
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're like, I didn't know how to read the rating system...

696
00:57:01,879 --> 00:57:02,679
[SPEAKER_11]: You're an idiot.

697
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:04,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind what our old Saturday morning cartoons were like.

698
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:11,243
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I realize I don't have kids, so maybe some people are not going to value my opinion, but whatever, F you, it's my show.

699
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:19,066
[SPEAKER_10]: If I had kids, I would want them to see that violence the first time, because they're going to see it.

700
00:57:19,286 --> 00:57:20,726
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to see it at a friend's house.

701
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:22,527
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to see it at some point.

702
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:23,927
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to see it on CNN.

703
00:57:23,947 --> 00:57:27,429
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to see it when they're flipping through the TV, and they'll see it on Comedy Central, okay?

704
00:57:28,189 --> 00:57:31,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand the double standard between sexual stuff and violent stuff.

705
00:57:48,212 --> 00:57:55,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll, regardless of the ESRB rating, I'm just going to pick games that I think are suitable for my child.

706
00:57:55,975 --> 00:58:02,437
[SPEAKER_11]: And that may be different than, like, honestly, if you teach them well enough, they know what fiction is, I mean...

707
00:58:04,261 --> 00:58:07,063
[SPEAKER_11]: The people that I'm killing in Grand Theft Auto aren't real people.

708
00:58:07,403 --> 00:58:11,405
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously you don't want to go emulate that on the street by going and killing real people.

709
00:58:11,485 --> 00:58:16,568
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're just AI computer controlled people.

710
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:19,570
[SPEAKER_11]: You can brutally murder them and nothing happens.

711
00:58:20,511 --> 00:58:22,432
[SPEAKER_07]: My point was going back to Saturday morning cartoons.

712
00:58:22,452 --> 00:58:26,034
[SPEAKER_07]: How many of us grew up with Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinx?

713
00:58:26,465 --> 00:58:26,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Tom and Jerry

714
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:58,445
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I grew up watching Tom and Jerry with, you know, Tom and Blackface.

715
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:02,007
[SPEAKER_10]: We watched Tom and Jerry cartoons in church.

716
00:59:02,687 --> 00:59:04,428
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to a Baptist church when I was younger.

717
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:06,390
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll save that discussion for another day.

718
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:07,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I was raised in one.

719
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:08,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

720
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:12,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember there was a lock-in, quote-unquote, at the church once, and we watched Tom and Jerry cartoons all night.

721
00:59:12,813 --> 00:59:16,256
[SPEAKER_07]: So... We watched Song of the South.

722
00:59:16,876 --> 00:59:17,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

723
00:59:17,676 --> 00:59:18,057
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, look.

724
00:59:18,557 --> 00:59:21,279
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to move on to other topics, but I... But the point...

725
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,921
[SPEAKER_07]: The point is that parents need to do their job.

726
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:28,542
[SPEAKER_07]: It's better that you were there with them to explain it than leave them unexposed.

727
00:59:28,562 --> 00:59:33,944
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I did actually know somebody who was pretty much blocked from everything when she was growing up.

728
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,824
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't know her while she was growing up.

729
00:59:36,964 --> 00:59:37,644
[SPEAKER_07]: My friends knew her.

730
00:59:38,225 --> 00:59:44,126
[SPEAKER_07]: But from what I understand, she was a lot more messed up than anyone I know who grew up exposed to everything.

731
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me quickly get some comments from chatroom.

732
00:59:46,656 --> 00:59:47,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat.orange.com.

733
00:59:47,896 --> 00:59:51,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Breakman says, if I ever have kids, I refuse to use cutesy names for things.

734
00:59:51,638 --> 00:59:55,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I want my kids to know that they have a penis or vagina, not a wee-wee or a hoo-hoo.

735
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:57,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Bonds006 says, I agree.

736
00:59:58,001 --> 01:00:02,043
[SPEAKER_10]: My mom had us watch a lot of adult shows and movies, and personally, I don't think it messed me up.

737
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:07,545
[SPEAKER_10]: And then DungeonBuster says, I love the Penn & Teller bullshit show where they looked at violent video games.

738
01:00:07,745 --> 01:00:08,646
[SPEAKER_07]: That was good.

739
01:00:08,826 --> 01:00:10,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'll have to find you the clip.

740
01:00:10,947 --> 01:00:16,751
[SPEAKER_07]: They get a 13-year-old with his mother's permission, put a gun in his hand, and they have a trainer there.

741
01:00:17,171 --> 01:00:17,832
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supervised.

742
01:00:17,852 --> 01:00:18,833
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a police officer there.

743
01:00:19,513 --> 01:00:23,075
[SPEAKER_07]: They give him an automatic weapon and say, okay, go ahead and shoot it once.

744
01:00:23,115 --> 01:00:23,836
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how you do it.

745
01:00:24,236 --> 01:00:26,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Shows him the proper everything.

746
01:00:26,558 --> 01:00:26,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

747
01:00:27,198 --> 01:00:30,561
[SPEAKER_07]: The kid shoots the gun, steps back, and says, wow.

748
01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:31,721
[SPEAKER_07]: And the guy goes, do you want to do it again?

749
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:33,563
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, no, I don't want to touch this thing again.

750
01:00:33,983 --> 01:00:36,284
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they showed him later on that he was in tears, 13 years old.

751
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:53,002
[SPEAKER_07]: But he goes home and plays SOCOM and all these violent games, yet is this the reaction that those people who are putting out that propaganda want to think is going to happen?

752
01:00:54,002 --> 01:01:16,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I would go to that extreme to teach my child but then again I have an issue with guns but we'll save that for another episode of the show but you get the point you're saying no I do I do the point was do these games train kids to be killers and clearly not first of all he didn't even hit the target or like he hit like way off right and second of all he didn't even want to touch it again

753
01:01:17,338 --> 01:01:18,359
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

754
01:01:39,961 --> 01:01:45,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Ab1371 in 2003 Strengthens informed consent requirements for mentally handicapped patients that take part in medical research

755
01:02:10,942 --> 01:02:17,044
[SPEAKER_10]: 2004, AB 2412, allows part-time community college faculty to access unemployment benefits.

756
01:02:17,564 --> 01:02:20,925
[SPEAKER_10]: AB 3042, enhances sentences for child prostitution.

757
01:02:22,185 --> 01:02:29,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, 2006, AB 409, establishes tighter controls and higher health standards for nail salons.

758
01:02:29,987 --> 01:02:36,068
[SPEAKER_10]: AB 1207, adds sexual orientation to the list of protections in the Code of Fair Political Practices.

759
01:02:36,608 --> 01:02:42,658
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, he's not been all about, you know, take it or leave it, whether you, I don't know what there you agree with or what you don't agree with.

760
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:51,131
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been other stuff to him than just this violent video game law, which I think, unfortunately, he's making a whole career defining thing out of.

761
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:54,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a heads up, he is running for mayor of San Francisco.

762
01:02:55,054 --> 01:02:55,915
[SPEAKER_10]: You may or may not know.

763
01:02:56,335 --> 01:03:02,759
[SPEAKER_10]: San Francisco, the former mayor, Gavin Newsom, is now the lieutenant governor of California after the November elections.

764
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:07,902
[SPEAKER_10]: So they have an interim mayor, and that means there's going to be a new mayor election this year.

765
01:03:08,002 --> 01:03:11,584
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are a handful of candidates in the ring, and Lee Lanee is one of them.

766
01:03:11,904 --> 01:03:13,505
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

767
01:03:13,765 --> 01:03:17,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Possibly maybe violent video games will be banned in San Francisco.

768
01:03:18,388 --> 01:03:18,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

769
01:03:18,809 --> 01:03:22,094
[SPEAKER_10]: They're banning Happy Meal Toys and Circumcision, too, on top of everything else.

770
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:22,895
[SPEAKER_10]: So why not?

771
01:03:22,935 --> 01:03:24,657
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just throw violent video games in there.

772
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:26,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

773
01:03:28,956 --> 01:03:29,636
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

774
01:03:55,891 --> 01:04:01,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still trying to find this one article that was talking about the greatest cartoons for traumatizing children.

775
01:04:02,654 --> 01:04:03,995
[SPEAKER_07]: But how about we talk about Zynga?

776
01:04:04,976 --> 01:04:07,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Zynga has something... That's pretty traumatic for children.

777
01:04:07,937 --> 01:04:08,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

778
01:04:08,918 --> 01:04:09,938
[SPEAKER_07]: It has something very new.

779
01:04:10,058 --> 01:04:14,140
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm actually going to quote this article because I like the way it's laid out.

780
01:04:14,761 --> 01:04:15,541
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a new venture.

781
01:04:15,881 --> 01:04:19,043
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something different from Farmville and Frontierville.

782
01:04:19,783 --> 01:04:21,164
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's where the quote begins.

783
01:04:21,964 --> 01:04:23,685
[SPEAKER_07]: 1.

784
01:04:22,064 --> 01:04:23,685
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't actually have VIL in the title.

785
01:04:24,645 --> 01:04:23,685
2.

786
01:04:24,746 --> 01:04:26,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Players play with actual, totally real money.

787
01:04:28,047 --> 01:04:26,807
3.

788
01:04:28,747 --> 01:04:30,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Players' companies won't necessarily grow.

789
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:32,749
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, it may shrink through no fault of their own.

790
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:33,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait.

791
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:35,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Players play with real money?

792
01:04:35,591 --> 01:04:35,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

793
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:40,773
[SPEAKER_07]: The company is Zynga, and it's not a game, but a stock offering.

794
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:41,333
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going public.

795
01:04:41,513 --> 01:04:43,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I get it.

796
01:04:43,374 --> 01:04:43,995
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going public.

797
01:04:45,015 --> 01:04:50,838
[SPEAKER_07]: They are filling an S1 form and going to be publicly traded.

798
01:04:52,532 --> 01:04:53,313
[SPEAKER_07]: We can really fuck them now

799
01:05:15,652 --> 01:05:22,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Now with all this talk about the decline of people using Facebook, Google Plus is coming out and has people talking.

800
01:05:22,797 --> 01:05:25,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, don't put it in the nail coffin of Facebook.

801
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:27,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Assuming that they let people in.

802
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,582
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just saying, there is this talk about Facebook might be slipping a little bit.

803
01:05:31,642 --> 01:05:34,864
[SPEAKER_10]: So is this the time for Zynga to say, trust in us?

804
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:36,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I really think...

805
01:05:37,506 --> 01:05:37,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Zynga's Profile

806
01:05:52,603 --> 01:05:53,624
[SPEAKER_10]: FarmVillain Facebook Games

807
01:06:21,552 --> 01:06:29,899
[SPEAKER_10]: That and a very neutered dog on their logo Doesn't that name have like a weird meaning to it too?

808
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:47,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember like where the company name came from Something silly Islander says I didn't know Zynga was on Facebook I've just been playing on Myspace Ladies and gentlemen we have found the one person that is still on Myspace I thought it was Tom I thought it was Justin Timberlake but go to chat right now he's there

809
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Zynga is the CEO's dog.

810
01:06:50,942 --> 01:06:52,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so that's why the logo's a dog.

811
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:52,843
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes sense.

812
01:06:53,403 --> 01:06:54,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see.

813
01:06:54,784 --> 01:06:58,586
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, we got a tweet about this tonight from Twitter user Nathan Jackson.

814
01:06:59,326 --> 01:07:01,347
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like you all to talk about Zynga going public.

815
01:07:01,427 --> 01:07:04,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you all think it would be sustainable with games like Farmville going down?

816
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:08,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of that same point I was just making, like things are declining.

817
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:10,833
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the only way Zynga can be...

818
01:07:11,943 --> 01:07:14,204
[SPEAKER_10]: I just hope to God it's not true that they tried to buy PopCap.

819
01:07:14,324 --> 01:07:16,585
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be, that would make me very sad if Zynga and PopCap merged.

820
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:17,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Very sad.

821
01:07:17,085 --> 01:07:17,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

822
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, moving on.

823
01:07:39,381 --> 01:07:42,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to some other news stories and release dates soon.

824
01:07:43,123 --> 01:07:44,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Some more depressing news.

825
01:07:45,605 --> 01:07:46,566
[SPEAKER_11]: If you thought, you know...

826
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:50,225
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

827
01:08:17,562 --> 01:08:30,493
[SPEAKER_11]: The bill states that 10 or more public performances by electronic means during any 180-day period of one or more copyrighted works will result in not more than five years of imprisonment.

828
01:08:30,933 --> 01:08:35,777
[SPEAKER_11]: So as long as the performance in question is valued at at least $2,500 U.S.

829
01:08:35,877 --> 01:08:41,662
[SPEAKER_11]: or the value of the license to legally perform its content is valued at $5,000 or more.

830
01:08:44,085 --> 01:08:44,245
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um...

831
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:03,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they're saying right now it says if it manages to pass.

832
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:20,158
[SPEAKER_11]: The homemade gameplay clips, which I've never heard of them called like this, but apparently referred to as Let's Play videos, fan-made music videos, a webcam, cover songs, anything I guess that involves music or video.

833
01:09:20,578 --> 01:09:24,941
[SPEAKER_11]: It could potentially cover cell phone videos of concerts and press events.

834
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:26,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

835
01:09:27,222 --> 01:09:37,824
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, basically, they're saying that this could apply to YouTube users and also sites that embed YouTube content as well.

836
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:45,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And really, to get down to the bottom of it, I think they're going to have a hard time regulating this stuff.

837
01:09:45,626 --> 01:09:48,887
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if they're going to go after everything, then...

838
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:51,111
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

839
01:09:51,171 --> 01:09:53,113
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is only going to benefit what?

840
01:09:53,553 --> 01:10:05,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that, you know, for example, if you take a song off an album and you put it as a YouTube video and you leave it there so people can listen or, you know, pirate that song, I understand that's bad.

841
01:10:05,721 --> 01:10:12,125
[SPEAKER_11]: If, for example, you know, you're... And I don't even know about so much the, you know, music videos and stuff.

842
01:10:12,145 --> 01:10:13,946
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a real big problem with that.

843
01:10:14,326 --> 01:10:15,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially gameplay videos.

844
01:10:15,827 --> 01:10:17,548
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand gameplay at all because...

845
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:28,995
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not really the same as putting a movie up, like an actual cinematic movie and you're pirating or a TV show or something like that.

846
01:10:30,235 --> 01:10:32,657
[SPEAKER_10]: This law is absolute, total, utter bullshit.

847
01:10:32,877 --> 01:10:36,619
[SPEAKER_10]: And the problem with it is that it's just shittily written.

848
01:10:37,159 --> 01:10:38,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a word I can use?

849
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:39,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Shittily?

850
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:39,821
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be.

851
01:10:40,181 --> 01:10:41,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

852
01:10:41,522 --> 01:10:42,482
[SPEAKER_10]: This law was shittily.

853
01:10:42,502 --> 01:10:44,283
[SPEAKER_10]: It's shite.

854
01:10:44,644 --> 01:10:45,164
[SPEAKER_10]: It's shite.

855
01:10:45,464 --> 01:10:46,785
[SPEAKER_10]: It is total, utter shite.

856
01:10:47,325 --> 01:10:51,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason why it's shite, it's just badly written because it includes all this other stuff.

857
01:10:51,268 --> 01:10:52,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I get what they're trying to do.

858
01:10:52,909 --> 01:11:00,833
[SPEAKER_10]: What they're trying to do is they're trying to get at these websites where you can log in and you can stream movies that are in the theater.

859
01:11:00,873 --> 01:11:01,794
[SPEAKER_10]: You can stream them.

860
01:11:02,134 --> 01:11:03,816
[SPEAKER_10]: or current TV shows and all that.

861
01:11:03,856 --> 01:11:13,446
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they're doing, but because they've left the door so wide fucking open, if somebody gets on there and tapes a karaoke performance and puts it up on YouTube, it could be subject to this law.

862
01:11:13,986 --> 01:11:18,611
[SPEAKER_10]: And you might be saying, well, that's not what they're trying to go after, but unfortunately when you have a shittily written law...

863
01:11:19,372 --> 01:11:20,133
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

864
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:40,739
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem is this is also, it's just taking a big fat dump all over fair use.

865
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:47,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I should be, yes, I should be able to upload video for the purpose of critiquing and commenting on it.

866
01:11:48,227 --> 01:11:52,812
[SPEAKER_10]: So you mean I'm going to have to contact the copyright owner to get express permission to do that?

867
01:11:53,152 --> 01:11:53,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, guess what?

868
01:11:54,014 --> 01:12:00,804
[SPEAKER_10]: All of your game review videos are going to be done by IGN, 1UP, GameSpot, and all the big companies.

869
01:12:00,844 --> 01:12:08,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Activision, all those times, they don't have the time for little pissants like you and me that they're going to sign off on the rights for that.

870
01:12:08,895 --> 01:12:12,158
[SPEAKER_10]: So say goodbye to independent media if something like this passes.

871
01:12:12,478 --> 01:12:12,998
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

872
01:12:13,019 --> 01:12:15,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Say goodbye to Orange Lounge Radio if this passes.

873
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:20,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm telling you, if this bill in its current form passes and goes effective, I'm walking away from this show.

874
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:26,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I am not going to go to jail because I like to play music over the classic game of the week.

875
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:28,932
[SPEAKER_10]: for the purposes of critiquing it.

876
01:12:29,653 --> 01:12:30,454
[SPEAKER_10]: That is not a threat.

877
01:12:30,494 --> 01:12:31,215
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a promise.

878
01:12:31,295 --> 01:12:35,300
[SPEAKER_10]: If this law passes and is enforced, there will not be Orange Launch Radio anymore.

879
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:35,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Period.

880
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:36,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.

881
01:12:36,842 --> 01:12:41,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Loki and DarkSakura will decide they want to do it, but somehow I don't think they want to subject themselves to that either.

882
01:12:42,389 --> 01:12:46,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, that is the seriousness of this bullshit law.

883
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:49,115
[SPEAKER_10]: I get what they're trying to do.

884
01:12:49,215 --> 01:12:50,496
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not doing it right.

885
01:12:50,576 --> 01:12:59,842
[SPEAKER_10]: So you need to contact your senator, contact folks, and tell them that this law is a bad thing for America.

886
01:13:01,996 --> 01:13:08,338
[SPEAKER_07]: There actually is a site up there that will generate email to your local legislature.

887
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,539
[SPEAKER_07]: So you do have a way of getting out.

888
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:15,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I have relinked it on my Facebook.

889
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,261
[SPEAKER_11]: And who is voting these goddamn people in the office?

890
01:13:18,321 --> 01:13:21,141
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously, all these Lenys and shit.

891
01:13:21,241 --> 01:13:25,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and he's going to become mayor now because he's such full of wonderful ideas?

892
01:13:25,182 --> 01:13:27,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember what I said about lazy Americans?

893
01:13:29,691 --> 01:13:35,244
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact that people won't get up and vote when these things come up.

894
01:13:36,728 --> 01:13:37,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Just sit back and bitch about it.

895
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:39,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, you don't vote about it, you have no right to complain.

896
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:47,899
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, yesterday I was on JustinTV and I did a search for Transformers and sure enough people were streaming a bootleg of Transformers 3 in a foreign language.

897
01:13:47,939 --> 01:13:48,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha ha ha.

898
01:13:48,999 --> 01:13:55,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then that needs to be worked out between JustinTV and the copyright owners of the work.

899
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:02,642
[SPEAKER_10]: And JustinTV should take action thusly against those accounts of people doing it because I'm sure that is against their terms of service.

900
01:14:03,122 --> 01:14:05,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, that's the law you need.

901
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:08,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Not sending me to jail because I want to sing...

902
01:14:09,283 --> 01:14:12,885
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to post a tape of Jessica and I singing Love Shack on the internet.

903
01:14:12,985 --> 01:14:15,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I would never post that tape on the internet, but she did.

904
01:14:15,446 --> 01:14:17,487
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't want her to go to jail for that.

905
01:14:17,908 --> 01:14:21,570
[SPEAKER_11]: And on top of that, that would make certain games illegal.

906
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:31,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I believe SingStar and stuff like that allows you to take songs and record videos to them and post them up on the internet.

907
01:14:31,214 --> 01:14:31,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

908
01:14:31,855 --> 01:14:35,917
[SPEAKER_11]: And also there's going to be a game like SingFor the Hits Edition that's

909
01:14:36,277 --> 01:14:38,122
[SPEAKER_11]: are going to have connectivity with YouTube as well.

910
01:14:38,403 --> 01:14:41,050
[SPEAKER_11]: So all those are basically felony makers.

911
01:14:43,228 --> 01:15:09,411
[SPEAKER_10]: unless of course those people that own those songs or you know own those video game companies and stuff like that don't stop these things from going because if no one complains then you know it's going to be alright Blackwolf in our chatroom says well to be fair I don't know if the guy who wrote this bill campaigned on this so they could have voted him in without knowing he was going to pen this specific bill and that's a true point you never know what politicians are going to do but we need to hold them accountable

912
01:15:09,811 --> 01:15:15,634
[SPEAKER_10]: And I plan to write my congresspeople and say, if you support this bill, I will not vote for you.

913
01:15:16,434 --> 01:15:17,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I will not vote for you.

914
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:21,857
[SPEAKER_11]: What's it take to, say, for example, get these guys out of office?

915
01:15:22,357 --> 01:15:25,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's these elections that they have every few years.

916
01:15:25,138 --> 01:15:29,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I understand that, but hey, we can— Recall, I guess.

917
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:33,202
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what happened with how Governor Schwarzenegger got into office in the first place.

918
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:37,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember the Governator?

919
01:15:38,495 --> 01:15:39,376
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where that all came from.

920
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:41,036
[SPEAKER_10]: He terminated the other governor.

921
01:15:41,437 --> 01:15:42,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't do shit.

922
01:15:43,137 --> 01:15:45,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think we ended up with the worst governor, but I don't want to make this show political.

923
01:15:46,579 --> 01:15:46,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyhow.

924
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:48,940
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm too late for that.

925
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

926
01:15:51,021 --> 01:15:58,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially after last week where things got a little heated, I really didn't want to have a political show tonight, but we can't fucking get away from it.

927
01:15:58,424 --> 01:16:01,025
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all that's in the news this week is all this political stuff.

928
01:16:02,446 --> 01:16:02,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

929
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:06,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's make our own country.

930
01:16:07,157 --> 01:16:07,418
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Oelaria.

931
01:16:11,808 --> 01:16:18,669
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, the senator that's behind this is Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota.

932
01:16:19,469 --> 01:16:20,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Minnesota.

933
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:25,010
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a whole website, opencongress.org, that will show you who's in favor of it and who's against it.

934
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:27,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, 51 companies for it, 3 against.

935
01:16:28,771 --> 01:16:36,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you, though, if it goes through, it's going to be yet another one of those laws that gets tied up because I would be fucking pissed because this just seems to violate fair use.

936
01:16:36,812 --> 01:16:37,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, really?

937
01:16:37,473 --> 01:16:39,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't film somebody at karaoke?

938
01:16:40,553 --> 01:16:41,414
[SPEAKER_10]: That is wrong.

939
01:16:42,494 --> 01:16:44,175
[SPEAKER_11]: How more ridiculous is this going to go?

940
01:16:44,215 --> 01:16:49,037
[SPEAKER_10]: On the bright side, American Idol will finally go off the air.

941
01:16:49,637 --> 01:16:52,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Say, for example, the Happy Birthday song.

942
01:16:52,418 --> 01:16:53,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that public domain?

943
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:59,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Are people going to get sued because there's a song playing in the background of a YouTube video or something like that?

944
01:17:00,262 --> 01:17:01,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Wedding videos?

945
01:17:04,604 --> 01:17:05,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know.

946
01:17:07,381 --> 01:17:09,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Leland Yee, at least one quote.

947
01:17:09,362 --> 01:17:13,444
[SPEAKER_11]: He's talking about different stuff, pandering towards corporations.

948
01:17:13,564 --> 01:17:16,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is one of those things that panders towards a corporation.

949
01:17:16,385 --> 01:17:26,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Not necessarily the one that you were quoting when he made that comment, but there are definitely a lot of bills and stuff that go towards these corporations that have these senators in their pockets.

950
01:17:27,791 --> 01:17:28,071
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

951
01:17:28,272 --> 01:17:29,653
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not much of a surprise.

952
01:17:29,794 --> 01:17:33,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you guys know, here's some of the organizations that are supporting this bill.

953
01:17:33,678 --> 01:17:46,153
[SPEAKER_10]: The Directors Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild, the Motion Picture Association of America, Recording Industry Association of America, NBCUniversal, Viacom, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Ultimate Fighting Championship...

954
01:17:49,396 --> 01:17:51,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Church Music Publishers Association.

955
01:17:51,838 --> 01:17:52,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're fucked.

956
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:54,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Church Music Publishers Association.

957
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:58,885
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all the RAA and MPAA and all the different movie studios because no one wants piracy.

958
01:17:58,965 --> 01:17:59,586
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

959
01:18:00,847 --> 01:18:02,368
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand.

960
01:18:02,448 --> 01:18:04,571
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no problem with them fighting piracy.

961
01:18:04,891 --> 01:18:05,712
[SPEAKER_10]: I get the...

962
01:18:07,573 --> 01:18:10,475
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason this bill is going into place, I get it.

963
01:18:11,116 --> 01:18:12,297
[SPEAKER_10]: This bill doesn't cut it.

964
01:18:12,617 --> 01:18:20,843
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to close these loopholes in the bill before it's... What is going to stop every website in Canada and other countries?

965
01:18:23,025 --> 01:18:26,288
[SPEAKER_10]: This is another reason... I promised I wouldn't get political, but I can't.

966
01:18:28,489 --> 01:18:28,609
[SPEAKER_10]: China.

967
01:18:28,629 --> 01:18:28,749
[SPEAKER_10]: China.

968
01:18:58,146 --> 01:18:59,850
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd rather live in Taiwan

969
01:19:08,682 --> 01:19:11,464
[SPEAKER_11]: We can still stream it, you know, stream to Canada.

970
01:19:11,604 --> 01:19:13,245
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can play all the Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

971
01:19:13,265 --> 01:19:14,565
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have to say where we're located.

972
01:19:16,066 --> 01:19:17,227
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in Canada.

973
01:19:17,927 --> 01:19:18,748
[SPEAKER_11]: And not in the U.S.

974
01:19:18,808 --> 01:19:22,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm not Benji in our chatroom says, actually, happy birthday is copyrighted.

975
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:22,750
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

976
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:28,393
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you put up a YouTube singing happy birthday to someone, you're going to be, your ass is going to jail.

977
01:19:28,533 --> 01:19:30,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to see that article.

978
01:19:30,354 --> 01:19:32,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Grandma goes, you know.

979
01:19:34,023 --> 01:19:37,246
[SPEAKER_11]: What happens if you do three different songs?

980
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:41,892
[SPEAKER_11]: If you sing Happy Birthday and then a couple other karaoke songs, and that's three strikes.

981
01:19:43,273 --> 01:19:44,194
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's not three strikes.

982
01:19:44,275 --> 01:19:47,158
[SPEAKER_11]: It's major violent felonies, I think, but...

983
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,521
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Morpheus in the chat room, our good buddy from Under Sedation Live, Saturday nights here at All Games.

984
01:19:53,841 --> 01:20:02,563
[SPEAKER_10]: But not to worry, this is going through Congress, so the public will have a voice and courts to fight it, unlike CARP, which was all secretly done behind closed doors.

985
01:20:02,703 --> 01:20:08,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, goddamn, sir, I hope you are right, because three words, this bill sucks.

986
01:20:08,745 --> 01:20:09,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking sucks, four words.

987
01:20:11,525 --> 01:20:14,726
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is really more important than balancing a budget, right?

988
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:21,749
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkTetsuya says, well, we're still waiting to see if Under Station Live will be banned in China.

989
01:20:22,449 --> 01:20:24,770
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be a great little thing for the network.

990
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:28,773
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be like the show from China versus the show that can't be in China.

991
01:20:28,933 --> 01:20:29,773
[SPEAKER_10]: All on one network.

992
01:20:29,793 --> 01:20:33,175
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, AllGames.com will also have to move to China or Canada.

993
01:20:33,435 --> 01:20:36,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Where could AllGames.com go if this bill passes?

994
01:20:36,717 --> 01:20:39,319
[SPEAKER_10]: AllGames.com, what country would we put them in?

995
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:40,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Where would Scott Rubin want to be?

996
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,503
[SPEAKER_10]: They can go to... Where would Scott... Amsterdam.

997
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:46,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Amsterdam.

998
01:20:50,187 --> 01:20:50,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit.

999
01:20:52,268 --> 01:20:52,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1000
01:20:52,828 --> 01:20:59,251
[SPEAKER_10]: There's football, but not... Well, then I guess they could do Canadian football in Canada.

1001
01:21:01,252 --> 01:21:01,552
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1002
01:21:02,013 --> 01:21:02,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

1003
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:08,553
[SPEAKER_10]: This bill is taking far too much time on our show, but at the same time it is very important.

1004
01:21:08,754 --> 01:21:11,235
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we just want to bring your attention to it.

1005
01:21:11,275 --> 01:21:12,176
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not fucking around.

1006
01:21:12,196 --> 01:21:18,341
[SPEAKER_10]: If this bill passes, say goodbye to a lot of your favorite gaming press stuff.

1007
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,462
[SPEAKER_10]: This is bad for the gaming industry.

1008
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,844
[SPEAKER_10]: This is bad for the gaming industry.

1009
01:21:23,064 --> 01:21:23,885
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they don't see it,

1010
01:21:24,534 --> 01:21:29,457
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1011
01:21:48,286 --> 01:21:54,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, on Tuesday, I think was the day it was finally posted, they finally posted a response.

1012
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:56,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Fans have been waiting for this.

1013
01:21:56,872 --> 01:22:03,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Quote, we never say never, but we can confirm that there are no plans to bring these three games to the Americas at this time.

1014
01:22:04,997 --> 01:22:15,391
[SPEAKER_10]: The Twitter response thanked Operation Rainfall folks for being such incredible fans but said there continues to be no plans for Nintendo of America to release these three games right now.

1015
01:22:15,812 --> 01:22:16,393
[SPEAKER_10]: So I see.

1016
01:22:16,533 --> 01:22:20,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen people rally for a Wii games release in a very long time.

1017
01:22:20,438 --> 01:22:21,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Not since President Cat.

1018
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,821
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1019
01:22:38,619 --> 01:22:42,440
[SPEAKER_10]: So our little campaign was not forgotten, which I think is great.

1020
01:22:43,061 --> 01:22:49,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And they actually said, the game is called President Cat, people, which made me laugh because the game actually wasn't called President Cat.

1021
01:22:49,363 --> 01:22:52,804
[SPEAKER_10]: We kind of gave it that name because the translation was like Boss Cat.

1022
01:22:53,164 --> 01:22:53,664
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I don't know.

1023
01:22:53,684 --> 01:22:54,325
[SPEAKER_10]: It just kind of came out.

1024
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:55,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's call it President Cat.

1025
01:22:55,925 --> 01:23:01,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the definition of a sukeban is like a delinquent gang leader girl.

1026
01:23:03,371 --> 01:23:12,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you imagine a cat being like a delinquent gang leader who is also the president of the company Yes Then that's what it's like Gangbanger cat

1027
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:15,664
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be the sequel.

1028
01:23:17,345 --> 01:23:17,626
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1029
01:23:19,447 --> 01:23:19,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeez.

1030
01:23:20,747 --> 01:23:28,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, by the way, Xenoblade is still getting a localization for an English-speaking country, and then some.

1031
01:23:29,372 --> 01:23:39,518
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a European localization in the works, and this is for Xenoblade Chronicles, and it was in an Iwata Asks interview that's a little video clip there.

1032
01:23:39,998 --> 01:24:06,950
[SPEAKER_10]: and Xenoblade is coming out in Europe on September 2nd it's going to come out with a red classic controller pro in order to localize a game for Europe I think it's got to be in English, French, Spanish, German and I'm forgetting a language but like there's like five languages Swahili probably wait English, French, German, Spanish probably Italian that's like five different languages the game's got to be in to come out over there and they should just do it in Latin

1033
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:10,252
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not worth the money to put out here

1034
01:24:33,647 --> 01:24:40,111
[SPEAKER_11]: To which I put, dot dot dot, instead we have some more Nintendo 64 games we'd like to port over and make zero changes and Zelda you get a premium.

1035
01:24:40,651 --> 01:24:41,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Love, Nintendo.

1036
01:24:43,212 --> 01:24:43,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1037
01:24:43,813 --> 01:24:45,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Zelda Ocarina of Time in 3D?

1038
01:24:45,954 --> 01:24:46,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a problem.

1039
01:24:46,674 --> 01:24:47,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Xenoblade?

1040
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:47,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you.

1041
01:24:49,756 --> 01:24:50,356
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm hearing.

1042
01:24:50,657 --> 01:24:52,057
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, you know what though?

1043
01:24:52,538 --> 01:24:55,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo's gonna be... You don't understand.

1044
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:57,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's how Nintendo's gonna fucking play this shit off.

1045
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we have no plans on doing that right now.

1046
01:24:59,121 --> 01:24:59,602
[SPEAKER_11]: But come E3...

1047
01:25:00,856 --> 01:25:26,759
[SPEAKER_11]: fans demanded it and Nintendo we hear you fans we're gonna bring it out for you because we're so gracious we're gonna bring them out to you it's basically you're gonna beg for it and then they're gonna say no and they're like ah well we're so gracious we're gonna bring it out to you so you know what when they do that don't fucking buy it tell them fuck you wait but why wouldn't you if they finally do decide to release the game isn't that what you wanted because it's the attitude that they're having with it

1048
01:25:28,532 --> 01:25:53,584
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I meet you all the way there like I don't disagree that something like that is very likely to happen but I had said before the show I said watch because Nintendo likes to kind of take games and redo them for new consoles like these will all be games on the Wii U and they'll be able to say that oh we're listening and we're oh these are games that the hardcore gamers want Last Story Plus Edition on the Wii U it's Last Story U and Xenoblade U

1049
01:25:54,424 --> 01:25:58,908
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not going to be that at all, because that would take additional effort.

1050
01:26:00,109 --> 01:26:01,450
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to put in additional effort.

1051
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:13,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even understand what the point is, because they've had other games that they have translated into English and released only in Europe and Japan, and never brought the Europe version of the game over here, which...

1052
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:19,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I would think if you're spending the money to translate into English, why not release it?

1053
01:26:19,506 --> 01:26:22,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell, you don't have to fucking advertise this thing very much.

1054
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:23,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Just put it out.

1055
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,013
[SPEAKER_11]: You will sell some copies of it.

1056
01:26:26,877 --> 01:26:27,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1057
01:26:53,110 --> 01:27:09,137
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a bummer that it's the Wii because if this was the 360 and there was enough fan demand, we've seen now where that game, and I forget what it was, Death Smile or whatever it was, that Japanese shooter game that came out in Japan and they just said, you know what, we'll put it up as a download title.

1058
01:27:09,177 --> 01:27:12,038
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to bother to translate it though, so fucking here it is.

1059
01:27:12,318 --> 01:27:14,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Just take it if you want it.

1060
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:16,080
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think people are generally happy with that.

1061
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:18,721
[SPEAKER_07]: And now there are special box sets and everything.

1062
01:27:18,741 --> 01:27:19,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1063
01:27:19,441 --> 01:27:23,843
[SPEAKER_10]: So, unfortunately, it would be great if the Wii could support that, but it can't.

1064
01:27:24,263 --> 01:27:31,947
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that... Maybe the punchline is the Wii U will, and these games will be downloadable on the Wii U. No, and here's the funny part about that.

1065
01:27:32,087 --> 01:27:39,091
[SPEAKER_11]: On top of the fact that they won't even bring it over here, they give Europe a nice collector's edition with a controller and everything for them.

1066
01:27:39,371 --> 01:27:43,613
[SPEAKER_11]: So, obviously, they know that the game's popular, but they just still don't give a fuck about you.

1067
01:27:44,033 --> 01:28:10,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Rickster in our chatroom says why do that Nintendo has already put the Wii out to pasture and I think that's a good point is you know well they've already said the Wii U is coming so let the Wii die basically a slow death as we get our last little hurrah Zelda game people still own Wiis and people and this Wii U isn't coming out until the end of next year so what the fuck are they gonna put out is everybody planning on buying a Wii U day one no if I've learned one thing from Nintendo consoles no I'm not

1068
01:28:10,712 --> 01:28:12,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not planning on buying this thing day one.

1069
01:28:12,813 --> 01:28:15,394
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, unless there's that just kick-ass must-have game.

1070
01:28:15,795 --> 01:28:16,515
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll wait and see.

1071
01:28:16,775 --> 01:28:21,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I am a consumer whore, though, so I still may succumb to needing it early or something like that.

1072
01:28:21,857 --> 01:28:22,278
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know.

1073
01:28:22,638 --> 01:28:30,602
[SPEAKER_11]: It really, so far, hasn't... I mean, it's basically a Wii with better graphics and a stupid controller that I don't really give two shits about.

1074
01:28:31,062 --> 01:28:31,222
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

1075
01:28:33,055 --> 01:28:38,481
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just gonna like, well, just because, okay, like when the PlayStation 3 came out, the PlayStation 2 didn't just roll over and die.

1076
01:28:38,581 --> 01:28:39,542
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it still hasn't.

1077
01:28:39,562 --> 01:28:44,788
[SPEAKER_10]: God of War was still going, and the old systems don't just roll over and die.

1078
01:28:45,369 --> 01:28:46,590
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think these games could keep it going.

1079
01:28:46,731 --> 01:28:48,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially not the Wii, because you have to understand...

1080
01:28:49,093 --> 01:28:55,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because everyone bought a Wii does not mean they're going to buy a Wii U. In fact, I think because you got all these old people and stuff like that to buy Wiis.

1081
01:28:56,278 --> 01:28:59,760
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that is not going to translate into more Wii U sales.

1082
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:02,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because you can use these Wii games on there.

1083
01:29:03,383 --> 01:29:04,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, think about it.

1084
01:29:04,263 --> 01:29:06,905
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, Rob, I need to buy a Blu-ray player.

1085
01:29:06,985 --> 01:29:09,167
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, it's okay because I can still play my DVDs on it.

1086
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:13,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, why am I going to buy a new unit if I already have something to play DVDs?

1087
01:29:13,068 --> 01:29:13,888
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't make any sense.

1088
01:29:14,668 --> 01:29:15,428
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta say this.

1089
01:29:15,548 --> 01:29:22,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not the only one that doesn't understand your perspective, Loki, of campaign to get the games out, and then when they come out, say fuck them because of their bad attitude.

1090
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:26,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Derek H in our chatroom says, Wait, so you'd be upset if they do what you want them to do?

1091
01:29:27,211 --> 01:29:32,432
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like going to McDonald's, buying a Happy Meal, then throwing it on the ground yelling, Fuck you, Ronald McDonald!

1092
01:29:34,232 --> 01:29:36,373
[SPEAKER_10]: The sad thing is I can see Loki doing that.

1093
01:29:37,993 --> 01:29:39,574
[SPEAKER_10]: There isn't enough fucking bacon.

1094
01:29:40,514 --> 01:29:53,918
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's my problem is how else then do you teach a company like this that you're not going to fucking take their... Oh, well, you're going to just have to take Reggie and bend him over your knee and say you're being very, very naughty.

1095
01:29:53,938 --> 01:29:59,940
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like fucking Konami with, well, if you really want this game to come out, you better have those pre-orders in.

1096
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:00,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

1097
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:01,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you!

1098
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not buying your goddamn game then.

1099
01:30:03,641 --> 01:30:10,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't give a shit if you put it out, because it will probably suck anyways, because all of your games, especially music games lately, have really blown.

1100
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:16,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I like doing the pre-orders to determine things, because that's how we got the low cost on the Macross box sets.

1101
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:19,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how the random ass DDR, we can never get away from that.

1102
01:30:20,205 --> 01:30:20,465
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1103
01:30:20,906 --> 01:30:22,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, it's because they pulled that bullshit.

1104
01:30:22,988 --> 01:30:25,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Capcom, why don't you step up and do this bullshit?

1105
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:27,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, this seems perfectly down your alley.

1106
01:30:27,692 --> 01:30:28,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what Nintendo should do?

1107
01:30:29,074 --> 01:30:33,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Should Nintendo put it up on their website and say, okay, if 10,000 people order Xenoblade, then we'll put it out?

1108
01:30:34,539 --> 01:30:37,722
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's what it's going to take for them to do it in time and matter, then fine.

1109
01:30:37,762 --> 01:30:38,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you do it?

1110
01:30:38,663 --> 01:30:40,124
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because I don't want to buy this fucking game.

1111
01:30:40,665 --> 01:30:41,666
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't play the Wii anymore.

1112
01:30:42,146 --> 01:30:42,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Who do I care?

1113
01:30:46,049 --> 01:30:47,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you, Ronald McDonald!

1114
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:48,730
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1115
01:30:49,311 --> 01:30:52,152
[SPEAKER_11]: I would, seriously, I would boycott the game then.

1116
01:30:52,252 --> 01:30:53,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you don't want to bring it out?

1117
01:30:53,472 --> 01:30:53,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine.

1118
01:30:53,753 --> 01:30:55,754
[SPEAKER_11]: You just want to put out some more Mario and Kirby games.

1119
01:30:56,174 --> 01:31:04,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Kirby, which, by the way, I don't know if anyone still cares about Kirby, but... This is like the opposite of Operation Rainfall.

1120
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:06,078
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Operation Thunder Snow.

1121
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:07,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Yo, fuck those games!

1122
01:31:09,961 --> 01:31:20,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you should start a campaign on Twitter Operation Thunder Snow Don't release those games In fact, don't buy Wii games P.S.

1123
01:31:20,956 --> 01:31:21,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you, Ronald McDonald

1124
01:31:22,136 --> 01:31:22,636
[SPEAKER_11]: No, seriously.

1125
01:31:22,716 --> 01:31:23,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's see.

1126
01:31:25,338 --> 01:31:29,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone's going to get fucking raging boner over goddamn Skyward Sword.

1127
01:31:29,861 --> 01:31:33,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, it's a Zola game with stuff in it.

1128
01:31:34,244 --> 01:31:38,127
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to say, though, the last story looked fucking great.

1129
01:31:38,267 --> 01:31:40,889
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was looking forward to seeing that announcement E3.

1130
01:31:40,969 --> 01:31:42,090
[SPEAKER_10]: And would I have bought that on the Wii?

1131
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:43,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, yes, I think I would have.

1132
01:31:44,774 --> 01:31:49,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I have one of those boners for Mistwalker that I kind of do for Q Entertainment.

1133
01:31:49,997 --> 01:31:53,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, even their mediocre games, I will still support, like Blue Dragon.

1134
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:54,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Mistwalker, guess what?

1135
01:31:55,141 --> 01:31:59,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because you had Nintendo publish your game in fucking Japan, you know what?

1136
01:31:59,704 --> 01:32:01,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Other companies will fucking publish it over here.

1137
01:32:01,326 --> 01:32:04,508
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need to go through all this bullshit of having to beg a company to bring it out.

1138
01:32:04,748 --> 01:32:05,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Because guess what?

1139
01:32:05,429 --> 01:32:06,970
[SPEAKER_11]: There's companies like Ignition...

1140
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:07,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1141
01:32:29,358 --> 01:32:35,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Guilty Gear that you would never ever fucking play if you relied on Nintendo to bring that shit over.

1142
01:32:35,682 --> 01:32:40,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know how many decibels I've taken down your mic this episode and it's still not enough because you keep getting louder?

1143
01:32:41,445 --> 01:32:43,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'm just saying that... You're just passionate.

1144
01:32:43,946 --> 01:32:45,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I am seriously passionate about it.

1145
01:32:45,667 --> 01:32:52,871
[SPEAKER_11]: The fact is I don't think that it should result in people begging a company like Nintendo to try to get them to understand the niche market.

1146
01:32:53,132 --> 01:32:57,434
[SPEAKER_11]: You need companies that already understand the niche market and will bring this shit over regardless.

1147
01:32:57,634 --> 01:33:02,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me ask this and then we can move on with more stories because we're an hour and a half into the show and haven't got to the end of part A yet.

1148
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:05,681
[SPEAKER_10]: What is your passion?

1149
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:07,683
[SPEAKER_11]: My passion?

1150
01:33:08,543 --> 01:33:09,724
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as these games go?

1151
01:33:09,845 --> 01:33:12,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do these stories get you so angry?

1152
01:33:12,307 --> 01:33:21,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's this whole, oh, we're this big company and we're just, you know, you should be gracious for everything they were putting out.

1153
01:33:21,354 --> 01:33:25,298
[SPEAKER_11]: And they just don't, they think they understand what their users want and they don't.

1154
01:33:25,578 --> 01:33:27,199
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1155
01:33:48,987 --> 01:34:13,169
[SPEAKER_11]: and we could bring this stuff over because we know we're doing the translation for Europe because hey they're a smaller market and I guess that makes it worth translating the game for it we could bring this over here with little effort whatsoever but no we're going to be assholes and say basically no we don't have any plans on doing this and yeah I know that you guys all rallied and really want this stuff over here and have committed to really going to buy this stuff

1156
01:34:13,889 --> 01:34:16,090
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Morpheus in our chatroom says Loki needs Prozac flavored bacon.

1157
01:34:36,618 --> 01:34:38,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I really want bacon flavored like medicine.

1158
01:34:39,801 --> 01:34:41,102
[SPEAKER_11]: That's disgusting.

1159
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:42,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you want to flavor bacon?

1160
01:34:42,123 --> 01:34:45,526
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you meant bacon flavored Prozac.

1161
01:34:46,186 --> 01:34:47,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Sky, is Loki turning green yet?

1162
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:49,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, still as white as you can believe.

1163
01:34:50,530 --> 01:34:54,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on with another news story and then we'll get into the release dates.

1164
01:34:54,453 --> 01:34:55,234
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

1165
01:34:57,556 --> 01:34:58,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Nintendo.

1166
01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:19,646
[SPEAKER_10]: you've been a very quiet lady over there and usually you're the opinionated one so I've got to know what is your thought on all this mess like Nintendo not releasing these are they being hard-headed is does it make good business sense I say it's average for Nintendo this is just par for the course I'm used to this shit that this is why this is why you've just become desensitized to this

1167
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:20,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much.

1168
01:35:21,741 --> 01:35:23,942
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically people... And not like I play my Wii anymore.

1169
01:35:24,123 --> 01:35:29,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo does something wrong, Loki yells and screams about it, lather, rinse, repeat for the past nine years.

1170
01:35:29,046 --> 01:35:32,788
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically people are... They're barking up the wrong tree.

1171
01:35:32,868 --> 01:35:45,256
[SPEAKER_11]: They're asking Nintendo to bring over this really niche game when they should really be bugging these other publishers that put stuff out on the Wii as well as other systems to bring over the games because I think these people... Like, you know, like, Atlus.

1172
01:35:45,436 --> 01:35:47,857
[SPEAKER_11]: There's another perfect example of a company that would do this.

1173
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:48,277
[SPEAKER_11]: They...

1174
01:35:49,278 --> 01:35:50,799
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all they deal with is niche shit.

1175
01:35:50,979 --> 01:35:51,940
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we get it.

1176
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:53,941
[SPEAKER_07]: We need the return of working designs.

1177
01:35:56,162 --> 01:36:00,044
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, actually, one of our pinball tables belongs to the owner of working designs.

1178
01:36:00,724 --> 01:36:00,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really?

1179
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:01,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Our Twilight Zone.

1180
01:36:01,525 --> 01:36:02,105
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of right, actually.

1181
01:36:02,125 --> 01:36:03,466
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how we got our Goemon doll.

1182
01:36:04,107 --> 01:36:06,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo plans on spending 16.5 billion yen on a new research and design facility in Kyoto.

1183
01:36:22,413 --> 01:36:23,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Nikkei, Japanese Stock Market

1184
01:36:43,917 --> 01:36:47,879
[SPEAKER_07]: They basically are trying to move everything into one house.

1185
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:54,943
[SPEAKER_07]: They are bringing in their R&D offices, all of the main staff.

1186
01:36:55,723 --> 01:36:57,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is going to be under one roof.

1187
01:36:59,586 --> 01:37:06,349
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Loki, 16.5 billion yen on a new research and design facility, yet no last story.

1188
01:37:06,789 --> 01:37:09,231
[SPEAKER_11]: What are your thoughts?

1189
01:37:10,832 --> 01:37:12,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they want to put everyone under one roof.

1190
01:37:12,332 --> 01:37:13,273
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see a problem with that.

1191
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:15,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Apple's doing the same thing.

1192
01:37:15,871 --> 01:37:18,153
[SPEAKER_11]: They're building some giant space saucer thing.

1193
01:37:18,173 --> 01:37:20,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they're building a metal donut in the middle of San Jose.

1194
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:22,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Homework approved.

1195
01:37:22,277 --> 01:37:26,741
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no square wall in the building or something like that.

1196
01:37:27,021 --> 01:37:31,125
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually wanted to make a building that looks like Steve Jobs' asshole.

1197
01:37:31,565 --> 01:37:33,527
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they're building in the middle of San Jose.

1198
01:37:35,208 --> 01:37:38,471
[SPEAKER_10]: So everybody can literally walk up his ass day in and day out.

1199
01:37:38,571 --> 01:37:40,053
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's going to be all made of glass.

1200
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:43,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I can actually point out something.

1201
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:49,402
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a psychological reason that you want to remove hard edges is that it reduces the urge for violence.

1202
01:37:50,523 --> 01:37:53,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, because when I think of Apple products, I think of violence.

1203
01:37:53,524 --> 01:37:54,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, maybe.

1204
01:37:55,045 --> 01:37:56,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's to make happier workers.

1205
01:37:57,646 --> 01:37:58,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, really?

1206
01:37:58,567 --> 01:38:04,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I know people that would kill someone, literally kill someone in the dead of night to get a job at Apple.

1207
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:07,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I don't think of Apple as having angry workers.

1208
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:09,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't do that.

1209
01:38:10,212 --> 01:38:10,412
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1210
01:38:10,432 --> 01:38:10,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1211
01:38:14,517 --> 01:38:20,918
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole, like, fact that, you know, it's been shown that circle buildings or whatever cause people not to be violent.

1212
01:38:21,578 --> 01:38:24,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like the hippie mumbo jumbo that Steve Jobs would be spouting anyways.

1213
01:38:25,839 --> 01:38:26,399
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

1214
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:27,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Hectagons piss me off.

1215
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:31,881
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think the whole thing is that he didn't like being called a square, you know?

1216
01:38:33,801 --> 01:38:34,521
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why.

1217
01:38:34,801 --> 01:38:35,201
[SPEAKER_11]: So, ha!

1218
01:38:35,301 --> 01:38:36,422
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't call me a square now.

1219
01:38:36,602 --> 01:38:37,502
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a fucking idiot.

1220
01:38:37,882 --> 01:38:38,302
[SPEAKER_11]: And a hippie.

1221
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,620
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to plant some trees.

1222
01:38:41,901 --> 01:38:43,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Go plant some trees, Steve.

1223
01:38:43,541 --> 01:38:45,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, we're going to plant a lot of trees.

1224
01:38:46,042 --> 01:38:47,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't need the brew me right anymore.

1225
01:38:47,723 --> 01:38:53,585
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how Loki had a wide open door to do more Nintendo bashing and he decided to take a pass.

1226
01:38:53,965 --> 01:38:56,286
[SPEAKER_11]: What am I going to say about Nintendo opening a facility?

1227
01:38:56,346 --> 01:38:57,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Good for them.

1228
01:38:57,067 --> 01:38:58,047
[SPEAKER_11]: They're opening a building.

1229
01:38:58,107 --> 01:39:01,048
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like this facility is going to research more Mario games.

1230
01:39:01,108 --> 01:39:03,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't know.

1231
01:39:03,389 --> 01:39:05,490
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just they're consolidating their stuff.

1232
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:06,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get you a little platter.

1233
01:39:07,631 --> 01:39:09,955
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm gonna hand you the joke on the platter, okay?

1234
01:39:10,015 --> 01:39:11,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is, here it is.

1235
01:39:11,317 --> 01:39:18,770
[SPEAKER_10]: They're building a, they're putting all these billions of dollars into a research facility for all those new franchises they put out.

1236
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:19,712
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, Loki.

1237
01:39:20,626 --> 01:39:22,727
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not... Hey, you know what?

1238
01:39:23,188 --> 01:39:27,630
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe they research shit for any of their franchises, so that's obviously not what it's for.

1239
01:39:27,890 --> 01:39:31,513
[SPEAKER_11]: It's for their new consoles that are so innovative and different from their last console.

1240
01:39:31,753 --> 01:39:35,395
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, this new console, what, it has a tablet for a controller.

1241
01:39:35,715 --> 01:39:38,837
[SPEAKER_11]: That's such a genius idea that they need a new research facility.

1242
01:39:38,857 --> 01:39:41,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Clearly an idea like that only could have come out of a building shaved like a donut.

1243
01:39:44,853 --> 01:40:00,492
[SPEAKER_07]: and basically quite a number of articles I just randomly found from anthropologists, different biologists, psychologists all pointing to the by the circle is a comforting and familiar shape to the mind on an unconscious level.

1244
01:40:01,193 --> 01:40:06,076
[SPEAKER_07]: As well as in art, we study the golden mean as a curve.

1245
01:40:07,256 --> 01:40:14,040
[SPEAKER_07]: So that it's like the shape of a shell, the circular shape of a shell.

1246
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:20,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Why a more circular face in some cultures is considered to be more attractive, they look for symmetry.

1247
01:40:22,424 --> 01:40:24,125
[SPEAKER_10]: The hectagons are still very rude, right?

1248
01:40:24,145 --> 01:40:24,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they are.

1249
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:29,148
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the record, they're actually a psychology behind it.

1250
01:40:30,481 --> 01:40:31,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe in psychology.

1251
01:40:33,243 --> 01:40:33,924
[SPEAKER_07]: That's clear.

1252
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:41,349
[SPEAKER_10]: There's that witty retort I've been waiting for DarkSakura all night.

1253
01:40:41,789 --> 01:40:44,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on to release dates.

1254
01:40:44,391 --> 01:40:48,955
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to travel the world and check out what's coming out to a store near you and eventually we'll get through this show.

1255
01:40:50,136 --> 01:40:50,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki!

1256
01:40:51,256 --> 01:40:58,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll save yourself some time because there's only one thing that's coming out this week that you really need to pick up and that would be Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.

1257
01:40:59,102 --> 01:41:17,650
[SPEAKER_11]: and that's of course assuming that Earth Defense or assuming that they didn't release it on Saturday wherever you live because that was the case in fact since we're getting into it now I will explain why it's being released on Saturday because it's a funny story actually and it also goes to show you GameStop they're fucking assholes

1258
01:41:19,192 --> 01:41:20,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so get this.

1259
01:41:20,813 --> 01:41:25,575
[SPEAKER_11]: D3, they put out the game, they shipped it to stores or whatever like that early and stuff like that.

1260
01:41:25,875 --> 01:41:32,679
[SPEAKER_11]: They misprinted the street date letter or the street date number or whatever on the master cases that went out.

1261
01:41:32,919 --> 01:41:37,901
[SPEAKER_11]: So it said streets July 2nd, despite the fact that all their paperwork, the street date letters, etc.

1262
01:41:37,941 --> 01:41:38,562
[SPEAKER_11]: say July 5th.

1263
01:41:39,102 --> 01:41:42,243
[SPEAKER_11]: GameStop's going, no take-back Cs, no take-back Cs.

1264
01:41:42,303 --> 01:41:43,323
[SPEAKER_11]: It fucking says the second.

1265
01:41:43,343 --> 01:41:50,265
[SPEAKER_11]: We're putting it on the second on all systems, even though it was only the 360 MasterCases that they messed up on.

1266
01:41:50,725 --> 01:41:57,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of, you know, D3 saying, you know, hey, GameStop, you know, I understand that we did misprint that on there, but the street date is still the fifth.

1267
01:41:57,847 --> 01:41:58,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you put it on the fifth?

1268
01:41:58,547 --> 01:41:59,847
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, fuck you.

1269
01:41:59,907 --> 01:42:01,928
[SPEAKER_11]: We're putting it out whenever we goddamn feel like it.

1270
01:42:02,048 --> 01:42:03,448
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's kind of what happened.

1271
01:42:03,588 --> 01:42:06,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Pinch, poke, yell me a coke, no take-back Cs.

1272
01:42:07,049 --> 01:42:12,390
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically now everybody's kind of putting it out because, well, GameStop's doing it.

1273
01:42:13,011 --> 01:42:14,791
[SPEAKER_11]: And they advertised it on the website.

1274
01:42:14,831 --> 01:42:16,372
[SPEAKER_11]: They called all their pre-order customers.

1275
01:42:16,692 --> 01:42:18,572
[SPEAKER_11]: They're assholes.

1276
01:42:18,952 --> 01:42:19,692
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, you know what?

1277
01:42:20,313 --> 01:42:22,673
[SPEAKER_11]: The benefit of it is that you get to play the game early.

1278
01:42:23,053 --> 01:42:26,274
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of people are going to be putting it out as well other than GameStop early.

1279
01:42:26,374 --> 01:42:31,075
[SPEAKER_11]: So bug killing on the 4th of July doesn't sound too bad.

1280
01:42:31,115 --> 01:42:33,376
[SPEAKER_10]: So the moral of the story is D3, learn to type.

1281
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:43,046
[SPEAKER_11]: yes and that's coming out on PS3 and 360 this week and I kid you not that's literally the only thing that's coming out this week

1282
01:42:44,690 --> 01:42:45,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how to play Mahjong.

1288
01:44:01,926 --> 01:44:02,509
[SPEAKER_10]: You should teach me.

1289
01:44:03,132 --> 01:44:03,936
[SPEAKER_08]: You've never played Mahjong?

1290
01:44:04,952 --> 01:44:08,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I played Shanghai on the old Macintosh.

1291
01:44:08,054 --> 01:44:08,894
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that counts.

1292
01:44:09,094 --> 01:44:10,755
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Mahjong Solitaire.

1293
01:44:11,176 --> 01:44:12,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about, like, for real Mahjong.

1294
01:44:13,317 --> 01:44:13,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

[SPEAKER_10]: Tekken 6 gets a price reduction this week on the PSP.

01:44:20,321 --> 01:44:20,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

[SPEAKER_10]: The Nintendo Wii, a red Wii Remote Plus control.

1300
01:44:24,543 --> 01:44:26,324
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all that's coming out on the Wii this week.

1301
01:44:26,765 --> 01:44:28,266
[SPEAKER_10]: But 3DS gets a couple games.

1302
01:44:28,746 --> 01:44:34,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Lotrek Tobuyaku no Kishidan comes out from Konami Games.

1303
01:44:34,409 --> 01:44:39,450
[SPEAKER_10]: This is... It's Dr. Lorcan, I don't remember the fucking subtitle to it.

1304
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:42,031
[SPEAKER_11]: It's from Konami, it's coming out in September.

1305
01:44:42,071 --> 01:44:43,991
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not Professor Layton.

1306
01:44:44,231 --> 01:44:47,832
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very similar to Professor Layton, but it's not.

1307
01:44:48,132 --> 01:44:56,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week, by the way, in Japan, you can look forward to this, not this week, next week, the 14th, the Flare Red 3DS and Star Fox 64 are the big releases in Japan next week.

[SPEAKER_07]: Virtua Tennis 4.

1311
01:45:03,178 --> 01:45:03,598
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 8th.

1312
01:45:04,439 --> 01:45:05,099
[SPEAKER_07]: For PC.

1313
01:45:05,739 --> 01:45:06,019
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1314
01:45:06,039 --> 01:45:06,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hooray.

1315
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:07,700
[SPEAKER_10]: I love tennis.

1316
01:45:08,941 --> 01:45:09,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

1317
01:45:09,662 --> 01:45:11,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Who plays tennis on the PC?

1318
01:45:11,123 --> 01:45:15,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week.

1319
01:45:15,645 --> 01:45:18,647
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll tell you what, this week's classic game of the week is old.

1320
01:45:18,667 --> 01:45:21,649
[SPEAKER_10]: No, really old, you guys.

1321
01:45:21,709 --> 01:45:22,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it is.

1322
01:45:22,429 --> 01:45:22,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1323
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:23,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1324
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:23,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1325
01:45:24,885 --> 01:45:46,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Game for Windows well at least the marketplace is going to be no longer is actually merging with Xbox.com on July 11th and that's all you need to know I guess they tried to overhaul it back in November and no one cared so now it's going to be part of the Xbox marketplace

1326
01:45:48,163 --> 01:45:48,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

1327
01:45:48,683 --> 01:45:50,344
[SPEAKER_10]: This actually kind of makes sense.

1328
01:45:50,464 --> 01:46:09,231
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Games for Windows was having a hard time kind of finding its market, especially versus Steam, to merge all the gaming into one place and to really kind of homogenize, if you will, the Xbox gamer tag and the experience and all that, bringing that, you know, connect to PCs even and all that, kind of bringing that all together.

1329
01:46:10,471 --> 01:46:12,432
[SPEAKER_10]: That all seems kind of smart for Microsoft.

1330
01:46:12,472 --> 01:46:14,173
[SPEAKER_10]: So this seems logical.

1331
01:46:15,453 --> 01:46:17,454
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess there's really not a lot else to say on that.

1332
01:46:18,755 --> 01:46:22,239
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be interesting though what will happen with the Windows 8 integration.

1333
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:25,522
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm most curious about because you know it'll somehow integrate into Windows 8.

1334
01:46:26,103 --> 01:46:33,391
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm really curious how Microsoft is going to tie together the 360 and Windows 8.

1335
01:46:33,711 --> 01:46:38,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Now there's only so much they can do because they don't want to get... Well the new interface looks like Windows 8.

1336
01:46:38,476 --> 01:46:40,158
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an optional interface, though.

1337
01:46:40,178 --> 01:46:45,764
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one thing that they haven't been... That was one type of interface that you can have.

1338
01:46:45,804 --> 01:46:48,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Windows will still have the traditional way of doing it.

1339
01:46:48,087 --> 01:46:48,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, that's right.

1340
01:46:48,788 --> 01:46:49,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Optional on Windows.

1341
01:46:50,229 --> 01:46:50,810
[SPEAKER_11]: My mistake.

1342
01:46:52,392 --> 01:46:53,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Required on 360.

1343
01:46:53,132 --> 01:46:53,172
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1344
01:46:55,629 --> 01:46:57,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's just like, what is that thing called?

1345
01:46:57,992 --> 01:47:00,836
[SPEAKER_10]: The multimedia Windows thing that you can do on the 360.

1346
01:47:01,917 --> 01:47:02,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Windows Media Center.

1347
01:47:02,898 --> 01:47:05,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Windows Live or whatever.

1348
01:47:05,081 --> 01:47:08,505
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a lot of what was shown with Windows 7, but how many people really use that?

1349
01:47:08,626 --> 01:47:09,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't use that in my house.

1350
01:47:09,767 --> 01:47:10,528
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too damn slow.

1351
01:47:11,129 --> 01:47:13,572
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know how many people use that, but there you go.

1352
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:17,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyhow, one other story for you guys and then we'll get into the classic game of the week.

1353
01:47:18,143 --> 01:47:20,664
[SPEAKER_10]: This is about a different classic game, GoldenEye.

1354
01:47:21,285 --> 01:47:25,848
[SPEAKER_10]: A domain has been spotted for a game called GoldenEye Reloaded.

1355
01:47:26,008 --> 01:47:27,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Not just one domain, a bunch of games.

1356
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:34,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it possible that last year's Wii game will be coming out on the 360 and PS3?

1357
01:47:34,574 --> 01:47:36,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Could it maybe be getting a sequel?

1358
01:47:36,676 --> 01:47:38,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Or could it just mean fucking nothing?

1359
01:47:38,837 --> 01:47:43,881
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be any of the above, but that domain has been spotted and it indicates that GoldenEye

1360
01:47:44,421 --> 01:47:48,162
[SPEAKER_10]: is not quite dead, even though the Wii version got kind of lukewarm reviews.

1361
01:47:48,542 --> 01:47:52,143
[SPEAKER_10]: But what would happen if that game came out in HD on the 360 or PS3?

1362
01:47:52,863 --> 01:47:55,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say that's actually kind of rad if that happens.

1363
01:47:55,324 --> 01:48:07,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, someone had already done the translation to HD already, but it got kind of tied up with the whole rights being owned by... Yeah, but doesn't Activision pretty much solely own the James Bond stuff now?

1364
01:48:07,888 --> 01:48:08,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1365
01:48:09,108 --> 01:48:19,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but I think that's why Goldeneye came out on the Wii and not on the other systems because the other James Bond games are terrible.

1366
01:48:20,207 --> 01:48:22,551
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's go to the gaming vault.

1367
01:48:24,332 --> 01:48:34,018
[SPEAKER_10]: and we're going to take a stroll down the gaming lane and find a classic video game in the vault that DarkSakura says, hey, you kids need to respect where your games come from.

1368
01:48:34,058 --> 01:48:37,720
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you wouldn't have Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.

1369
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:42,422
[SPEAKER_10]: You wouldn't have The Last Story or any of these games if it weren't for games such as this one.

1370
01:48:42,783 --> 01:48:44,504
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1371
01:48:44,824 --> 01:48:48,126
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a game that I played when I was five years old.

1372
01:48:48,566 --> 01:48:50,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, so this would have been like 50 years ago?

1373
01:48:50,887 --> 01:48:51,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

1374
01:48:51,348 --> 01:48:51,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

1375
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:57,373
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called The Quest for the Rings, and it was on the Odyssey 2 and Video Pack.

1376
01:48:57,753 --> 01:49:00,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Came out in 1981.

1377
01:49:00,816 --> 01:49:02,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's listen to some of those bleeps and bloops.

1378
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:08,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, that's the game sound.

1379
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:10,622
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when it's having you pick your class.

1380
01:49:11,343 --> 01:49:16,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get to somebody like... That's gonna hurt our listeners' ears, but there you go, it's in the background.

1381
01:49:17,856 --> 01:49:18,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this game.

1382
01:49:18,676 --> 01:49:28,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And keep in mind, I played this game actually for a few years, because when I moved next door to a couple other friends, they had an Odyssey 2.

1383
01:49:29,219 --> 01:49:32,660
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got to play it again, and I loved the game even over the years.

1384
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:36,422
[SPEAKER_07]: But okay, Quest for the Rings basically was sort of...

1385
01:49:37,882 --> 01:49:40,563
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what Gauntlet should have been based off of.

1386
01:49:41,564 --> 01:49:48,428
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very Gauntlet-y, but this came out four years before Gauntlet existed.

1387
01:49:49,928 --> 01:49:52,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It had a board game released with it.

1388
01:49:52,610 --> 01:49:54,991
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a combination of a video game and a board game.

1389
01:49:55,011 --> 01:49:56,952
[SPEAKER_07]: It came in this huge-ass box.

1390
01:49:57,012 --> 01:49:58,073
[SPEAKER_07]: It was gorgeous.

1391
01:49:59,493 --> 01:50:02,095
[SPEAKER_07]: You had one person who was the ringmaster.

1392
01:50:02,615 --> 01:50:07,858
[SPEAKER_07]: So sort of like a combination between playing the D&D board game and playing Gauntlet.

1393
01:50:09,799 --> 01:50:21,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could play the board game with the stuff that would go on in the quest mode, or you could actually just play the game in quest mode and play through the different levels.

1394
01:50:21,685 --> 01:50:25,447
[SPEAKER_07]: This was the game that I was trying to remember the name of a few episodes ago.

1395
01:50:27,188 --> 01:50:30,030
[SPEAKER_07]: So you had four classes that you could play as.

1396
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:31,731
[SPEAKER_07]: You could be a warrior.

1397
01:50:33,212 --> 01:50:34,813
[SPEAKER_07]: He can kill stuff.

1398
01:50:35,373 --> 01:50:40,336
[SPEAKER_07]: You could be a wizard who can stun other enemies.

1399
01:50:41,116 --> 01:50:48,460
[SPEAKER_07]: You could also be a changeling who could turn invisible.

1400
01:50:48,921 --> 01:50:52,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Except when the changeling was invisible, you couldn't see him either.

1401
01:50:53,703 --> 01:51:10,431
[SPEAKER_07]: and then there was the phantom who could walk through all kinds of walls except for one kind and he did it at half speed which actually I would usually pick either the phantom or the changeling but the phantom was super convenient to have because there were levels later on where the walls would change location

1402
01:51:11,730 --> 01:51:12,911
[SPEAKER_07]: It was super aggravating.

1403
01:51:13,492 --> 01:51:15,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the gameplay video stopped because there was only about two minutes of it.

1404
01:51:16,615 --> 01:51:19,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I found this related video that I'd seen before that's actually pretty funny.

1405
01:51:20,079 --> 01:51:21,981
[SPEAKER_10]: This is how games were marketed back then.

1406
01:51:22,001 --> 01:51:24,344
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to play the commercial for this game real quick.

1407
01:51:26,909 --> 01:51:28,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Wizard of Odyssey?

1408
01:51:28,270 --> 01:51:31,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the keyboard really the key to greater challenge in video games?

1409
01:51:31,771 --> 01:51:32,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it is.

1410
01:51:32,611 --> 01:51:35,012
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play strategy games like Quest for the Rings.

1411
01:51:35,272 --> 01:51:37,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Plan your strategy on the game board.

1412
01:51:37,213 --> 01:51:39,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Use the keyboard to change heroes, enemies, places.

1413
01:51:40,054 --> 01:51:40,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Be a wizard.

1414
01:51:40,875 --> 01:51:43,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Outwit fiery dragons.

1415
01:51:43,136 --> 01:51:44,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Take that dragon.

1416
01:51:44,376 --> 01:51:45,797
[SPEAKER_04]: We wizards hate to lose.

1417
01:51:46,097 --> 01:51:50,759
[SPEAKER_04]: The Master Strategy Series, only from Odyssey 2, where the keyboard is the key to greater challenge.

1418
01:51:51,219 --> 01:51:51,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy Odyssey.

1419
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:55,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Get $82 worth of free games, including Quest for the Rings and Pickaxe Pete.

1420
01:51:57,483 --> 01:52:00,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I had pick XP too.

1421
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:01,148
[SPEAKER_10]: $82 worth of games.

1422
01:52:01,208 --> 01:52:02,771
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was $41 a piece.

1423
01:52:02,811 --> 01:52:05,715
[SPEAKER_10]: So this game with its bleepy bloops, $41 in 19... What is this commercial?

1424
01:52:05,735 --> 01:52:06,757
[SPEAKER_10]: 1981, I think?

1425
01:52:06,817 --> 01:52:07,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1426
01:52:07,097 --> 01:52:07,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Was this commercial?

1427
01:52:11,443 --> 01:52:13,425
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's... I mean, games were expensive.

1428
01:52:13,825 --> 01:52:14,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1429
01:52:15,306 --> 01:52:17,027
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting, too, that they used the keyboard.

1430
01:52:17,087 --> 01:52:18,669
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really the niche for the Odyssey.

1431
01:52:18,709 --> 01:52:20,290
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess just be competitive with the 2600.

1432
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:24,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, real gaming uses a keyboard, which is funny because that argument is still used today.

1433
01:52:25,093 --> 01:52:34,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the other thing with the Odyssey, too, is that it was also advertised as an educational system, too, because there were a number of educational games on it.

1434
01:52:34,981 --> 01:52:39,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, one that we used to play all the time was CryptoQuip, where you put in a word...

1435
01:52:42,346 --> 01:53:06,765
[SPEAKER_07]: We put in a word and then it scrambles it and we would always pick one person in our group that had to unscramble the word and so they'd have us face the wall except whenever it was me, I mean I was always really good at it anyway but the wall that they would have us face had a mirror on it and I've been able to read backwards since I've been able to read so it was never that difficult.

1436
01:53:07,165 --> 01:53:09,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And this also was a system that had Casey Munchkin.

1437
01:53:10,126 --> 01:53:13,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it Munchkin or Crazy Chase that was the Pac-Man clone?

1438
01:53:13,347 --> 01:53:15,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Casey Munchkin, I think it was called.

1439
01:53:15,208 --> 01:53:16,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I've actually got a couple copies of.

1440
01:53:18,249 --> 01:53:20,290
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was a cease and desist put on them.

1441
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:26,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So to find... I mean, it's not really super expensive, but to find a copy of Casey Munchkin is, you know, kind of a find.

1442
01:53:27,233 --> 01:53:29,293
[SPEAKER_10]: So what made this game awesome to a five-year-old?

1443
01:53:30,814 --> 01:53:33,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it was just that you could, you know, you could fight a dragon.

1444
01:53:34,195 --> 01:53:36,236
[SPEAKER_07]: But the dragon, you know, you couldn't kill the dragon.

1445
01:53:37,405 --> 01:53:38,766
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was just an adventure game.

1446
01:53:38,786 --> 01:53:40,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, look how awesome the dragon looked.

1447
01:53:40,807 --> 01:53:41,948
[SPEAKER_07]: The big green blip.

1448
01:53:42,608 --> 01:53:44,089
[SPEAKER_07]: That was serious graphics.

1449
01:53:44,349 --> 01:53:45,069
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Godzilla.

1450
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:55,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to show everybody what this picture looks like because, I mean, seriously, that was pretty hardcore awesome graphics for, you know, when I was five.

1451
01:53:56,756 --> 01:53:59,719
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1452
01:53:59,779 --> 01:54:00,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry, there's more?

1453
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1454
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:02,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you sounded like we were done.

1455
01:54:02,361 --> 01:54:03,041
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, then what else?

1456
01:54:03,742 --> 01:54:06,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was going to tell you about the other things that were in the game.

1457
01:54:06,364 --> 01:54:07,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay, well, please do.

1458
01:54:07,665 --> 01:54:09,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then let me restart the music.

1459
01:54:10,027 --> 01:54:14,251
[SPEAKER_07]: You had five kinds of monsters, and they had the most awesome names.

1460
01:54:15,111 --> 01:54:17,113
[SPEAKER_07]: There were orcs and fire wraiths.

1461
01:54:18,294 --> 01:54:21,799
[SPEAKER_07]: who were really... They actually looked just alike, except they were different colors.

1462
01:54:21,899 --> 01:54:22,861
[SPEAKER_07]: One was pink, one was blue.

1463
01:54:23,321 --> 01:54:29,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you had dragons, which they basically moved left and right across the screen, but if you got in their way, they'd be like, and run at you.

1464
01:54:29,850 --> 01:54:31,152
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'd be like, oh shit, it's a dragon.

1465
01:54:32,314 --> 01:54:33,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was...

1466
01:54:35,618 --> 01:54:51,744
[SPEAKER_07]: The Nightmares, by Droth Tarantulas, and Doomed Wing Bloodthirst, which makes me think that the designers of WoW played this game and took inspiration from the characters in the game.

1467
01:54:53,556 --> 01:54:58,438
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, I always... This is one game that I seriously thought they should totally remake.

1468
01:54:59,358 --> 01:55:06,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Because... It was just... The theory behind it was so awesome.

1469
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:07,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It really was.

1470
01:55:08,781 --> 01:55:10,881
[SPEAKER_07]: It was simple, simple gameplay.

1471
01:55:12,402 --> 01:55:21,705
[SPEAKER_07]: But it did it so effectively that I don't think any other game has been, you know... If I'm looking back to this as one of my favorite classic games ever...

1472
01:55:23,686 --> 01:55:26,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, you know, it's got to have something, say something for its staying power.

1473
01:55:27,349 --> 01:55:32,054
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll go ahead and actually link what the cover looked like in the chat room.

1474
01:55:32,154 --> 01:55:34,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it had a really epic 80s cover.

1475
01:55:34,056 --> 01:55:36,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, man, that's when people actually juice shit by hand.

1476
01:55:37,790 --> 01:55:38,250
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm done.

1477
01:55:39,171 --> 01:55:42,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Classic game of the week, the quest for the rings for the Odyssey 2.

1478
01:55:43,314 --> 01:55:44,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn, that's old.

1479
01:55:44,475 --> 01:55:48,858
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we're going to take a break here, but don't worry, there's plenty more of Orange Lawns ready to come.

1480
01:55:48,898 --> 01:55:50,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God there's no work tomorrow.

1481
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:51,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Fear!

1482
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,422
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yep, we can stay up late a little bit.

1483
01:55:54,442 --> 01:55:54,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Pinkberry run.

1484
01:55:55,943 --> 01:55:56,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Pinkberry closes at 10.

1485
01:55:56,984 --> 01:55:58,064
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be done by 10.

1486
01:55:58,365 --> 01:55:59,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to break it to you.

1487
01:55:59,625 --> 01:56:00,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll send the husband to go get it.

1488
01:56:01,207 --> 01:56:02,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that I can buy into.

1489
01:56:03,408 --> 01:56:05,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we gotta take a break though.

1490
01:56:05,269 --> 01:56:08,210
[SPEAKER_10]: When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

[SPEAKER_07]: You were thinking of vanilla ice.

1508

01:57:51,298 --> 01:58:17,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Doing lulzy Warcraft chat And this week was a real fun show We talked a lot There was a brand new patch in WoW this week 4.2 And also huge news about Warcraft It didn't make this show roll Probably because I already talked about it on Horde House But WoW has gone free to play in some ways Until level 20 Basically what existed as the free trial before Is now an unlimited trial It's not capped to 14 days So you can play all the way to level 20

1516
01:58:18,260 --> 01:58:19,160
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1517
01:58:40,285 --> 01:59:01,401
[SPEAKER_10]: which we actually got into a discussion about we really wish that there was some way that we could cross zones in play because you can't play on... Oh yeah, it's one of the biggest drawbacks of WoW is that there's no way for us to roll on Europe and they can't roll on us unless you actually buy that region's copy of the freaking game and do it that way and it's kind of a pain in the ass.

1518
01:59:01,441 --> 01:59:02,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's butt-hearted.

1519
01:59:03,423 --> 01:59:09,668
[SPEAKER_10]: But the host over there still, we're good net friends because she's been on Horde House a couple times now and always brings the lulz.

1520
01:59:10,288 --> 01:59:11,590
[SPEAKER_07]: But I signed up on their forums.

1521
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:12,271
[SPEAKER_07]: They're fun people.

1522
01:59:13,472 --> 01:59:16,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had a really, really good time.

1523
01:59:16,376 --> 01:59:17,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Really long discussion.

1524
01:59:18,959 --> 01:59:21,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope to go back again.

1525
01:59:22,623 --> 01:59:24,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Prospects seem hopeful.

1526
01:59:24,846 --> 01:59:26,308
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were just great people.

1527
01:59:26,408 --> 01:59:26,949
[SPEAKER_07]: All three of them.

1528
01:59:27,249 --> 01:59:28,631
[SPEAKER_07]: I really enjoyed the time I had.

1529
01:59:29,972 --> 01:59:32,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you just love EJ's accent?

1530
01:59:32,735 --> 01:59:32,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1531
01:59:32,956 --> 01:59:34,037
[SPEAKER_10]: I love her accent.

1532
01:59:34,938 --> 01:59:35,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Love it.

1533
01:59:35,579 --> 01:59:37,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Just want to put it in a little voice box and open it.

1534
01:59:38,001 --> 01:59:38,923
[SPEAKER_10]: The haters are going to hate.

1535
01:59:39,403 --> 01:59:42,607
[SPEAKER_07]: She says, fuck all, better than anyone I've ever heard.

1536
01:59:43,911 --> 01:59:51,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, by the way, we got a tweet from the Girls Gone Wow show on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR is our Twitter and GGW show is theirs.

1537
01:59:51,803 --> 01:59:54,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I loved having DarkSakura on our podcast.

1538
01:59:54,227 --> 01:59:55,348
[SPEAKER_10]: She was an amazing guest.

1539
01:59:55,508 --> 01:59:57,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in your show kidnapping your host.

1540
01:59:58,092 --> 01:59:58,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Kisses.

1541
02:00:00,015 --> 02:00:00,295
Okay.

1542
02:00:01,776 --> 02:00:02,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, no.

1543
02:00:03,216 --> 02:00:03,937
[SPEAKER_10]: You're here first.

1544
02:00:03,977 --> 02:00:06,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Clone, clone, clone, clone, clone.

1545
02:00:07,438 --> 02:00:08,139
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think that's great.

1546
02:00:09,059 --> 02:00:12,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, since I said it on Bobby's show tonight, I guess we could say it here.

1547
02:00:13,441 --> 02:00:17,963
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a third podcast in the works.

1548
02:00:18,363 --> 02:00:18,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there is.

1549
02:00:18,823 --> 02:00:21,845
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're looking at taping the pilot in the next week or so.

1550
02:00:22,625 --> 02:00:24,726
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm hoping we'll have more information soon.

1551
02:00:25,046 --> 02:00:25,786
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's all you get.

1552
02:00:26,867 --> 02:00:27,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I can say one thing.

1553
02:00:27,747 --> 02:00:28,067
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

1554
02:00:28,328 --> 02:00:29,188
[SPEAKER_07]: It will involve a Dan.

1555
02:00:30,396 --> 02:00:31,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we can say that.

1556
02:00:31,296 --> 02:00:32,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, it will involve Dan.

1557
02:00:32,277 --> 02:00:32,977
[SPEAKER_07]: It will involve Dan.

1558
02:00:33,117 --> 02:00:34,818
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are going to leave it at that.

1559
02:00:34,838 --> 02:00:35,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I said A-Dan.

1560
02:00:35,779 --> 02:00:35,979
[SPEAKER_10]: A-Dan.

1561
02:00:35,999 --> 02:00:36,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not say which Dan.

1562
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:38,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It will involve a Dan.

1563
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:39,541
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1564
02:00:42,062 --> 02:00:44,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get into some rapid fire news.

1565
02:00:44,683 --> 02:00:53,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the news that there's lots of news this week and some of it we just don't have time to talk 15 minutes about like we did some of those Nintendo stories tonight.

1566
02:00:53,447 --> 02:00:54,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

1567
02:00:55,161 --> 02:00:56,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, this is kind of neat.

1568
02:00:57,423 --> 02:01:07,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Kotaku, I don't know if they've been doing the actual translations themselves, but they've been running on their website every Thursday starting a couple weeks ago.

1569
02:01:10,382 --> 02:01:12,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Localized versions of Retro Game Master.

1570
02:01:12,905 --> 02:01:26,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, for those who haven't heard of Retro Game Master, it's a show in Japan that has this game master who plays through old classic games, and there's kind of commentary going along with it, so...

1571
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:29,302
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like the same thing I see on billions of YouTube channels and JustinTVs.

1572
02:01:29,322 --> 02:01:30,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of like that, but it's funny.

1573
02:01:31,984 --> 02:01:34,105
[SPEAKER_11]: He has trouble with some of the games, and it's his commentary.

1574
02:01:34,185 --> 02:01:35,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Professionally written, I guess?

1575
02:01:36,107 --> 02:01:36,547
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

1576
02:01:36,707 --> 02:01:37,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1577
02:01:38,348 --> 02:01:43,732
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first episode was Ninja Gaiden, and then, of course, this week's episode was Super Fantasy Zone.

1578
02:01:44,172 --> 02:01:45,193
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can check them out.

1579
02:01:45,213 --> 02:01:50,816
[SPEAKER_11]: They're streaming, like I said, every Thursday on their Thursday at 8 p.m.

1580
02:01:50,977 --> 02:01:54,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Eastern is when they have the thing going.

1581
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:55,399
[SPEAKER_11]: So check it out.

1582
02:01:56,701 --> 02:02:00,245
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the type of stuff that should have been on G4 back in the day when they talked about games.

1583
02:02:00,265 --> 02:02:03,649
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the Portal 2 information.

1584
02:02:04,009 --> 02:02:10,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Portal 2... Sorry, I was talking to our chatters who now of course are asking a ton of questions on that little tease about the other podcast.

1585
02:02:11,518 --> 02:02:11,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1586
02:02:13,059 --> 02:02:16,040
[SPEAKER_10]: They teamed up with Kotaku to put the episodes out?

1587
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:16,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1588
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:17,280
[SPEAKER_10]: That's interesting.

1589
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:18,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm not knocking Kotaku.

1590
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:20,101
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fine website, what have you.

1591
02:02:20,121 --> 02:02:20,801
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just interesting.

1592
02:02:20,861 --> 02:02:28,963
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like a big Hulu or Netflix or even YouTube.

1593
02:02:29,043 --> 02:02:31,563
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very kind of niche gaming site.

1594
02:02:31,723 --> 02:02:33,984
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's one of the bigger gaming blogs, certainly.

1595
02:02:34,044 --> 02:02:35,864
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just an interesting path.

1596
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:38,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I don't think of Kotaku television very often.

1597
02:02:38,765 --> 02:02:40,165
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's interesting for them.

1598
02:02:40,505 --> 02:02:40,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1599
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:43,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Portal 2 Patent Pending

1600
02:02:59,197 --> 02:03:01,820
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also another called Infinifling.

1601
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:05,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I was, I guess, focusing on mid-air portaling techniques.

1602
02:03:06,303 --> 02:03:07,004
[SPEAKER_11]: That was second.

1603
02:03:07,064 --> 02:03:13,129
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Endifice, which is based on some destroyed aperture chambers, picked up an honorable mention.

1604
02:03:13,489 --> 02:03:18,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, all these are available to download at, of course, the portal website, thinkwithportals.com.

1605
02:03:20,935 --> 02:03:45,773
[SPEAKER_10]: and many other user created levels so if you've played through Portal 2 already on PC and you want to go back and try some custom maps and stuff you can go and download these and it's really easy to access them in game so I haven't really played around with this yet but I always thought if this came out it would kind of all be integrated into Steam but it's not like I have to go to this website and do like I don't have to hack my game per se right but don't I have to have this dev mode or something

1606
02:03:46,112 --> 02:03:46,653
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not really.

1607
02:03:46,673 --> 02:03:53,824
[SPEAKER_11]: You just pull up the console in the game by hitting the title key and then there's a simple command you put in there.

1608
02:03:55,327 --> 02:03:56,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well that's cool.

1609
02:03:59,932 --> 02:04:06,695
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be kind of cool if they integrated it with some sort of option in a menu or something like that where you can just select a map and play it.

1610
02:04:07,416 --> 02:04:11,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe make multiple maps or something like that so you can have your own single player campaigns.

1611
02:04:12,558 --> 02:04:16,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, obviously, not something that you're going to be able to play on consoles.

1612
02:04:16,881 --> 02:04:19,743
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, Left 4 Dead 2.

1613
02:04:21,964 --> 02:04:24,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently they had a little Easter egg in there.

1614
02:04:24,525 --> 02:04:31,089
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a community-made campaign called Suicide Blitz 2 in Left 4 Dead 2.

1615
02:04:31,849 --> 02:04:36,211
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's one of the officially featured fan-created add-ons for the game.

1616
02:04:36,932 --> 02:04:40,294
[SPEAKER_11]: And it has a very neat Portal 2 Easter egg buried in it.

1617
02:04:40,854 --> 02:04:41,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently if you...

1618
02:04:44,966 --> 02:04:51,211
[SPEAKER_11]: You find a portal, I guess, into the actual Aperture Science.

1619
02:04:53,252 --> 02:05:05,600
[SPEAKER_11]: You can, I guess, find the Aperture Science and also Companion Cube, Propression Gel, Special Infected Zombies, and all sorts of neat stuff.

1620
02:05:05,740 --> 02:05:06,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I was watching the video.

1621
02:05:06,681 --> 02:05:09,803
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a video attached to the story that had two giggling girls playing the game.

1622
02:05:10,804 --> 02:05:14,766
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked really well done from what I was watching.

1623
02:05:15,967 --> 02:05:19,710
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked like you were freaking playing Portal but inside Left 4 Dead.

1624
02:05:20,190 --> 02:05:22,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I like those wacky, zany crossovers.

1625
02:05:23,192 --> 02:05:24,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and I like how you have to find a gnome.

1626
02:05:25,874 --> 02:05:26,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1627
02:05:28,163 --> 02:05:29,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Street Fighter 4, the ports keep on coming

1628
02:05:46,677 --> 02:05:47,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Volt, it's now available.

1629
02:05:47,959 --> 02:05:49,100
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not something you have to wait for.

1630
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:52,564
[SPEAKER_10]: It was announced at a Capcom event in Tokyo, but it's available now.

1631
02:05:52,865 --> 02:05:54,647
[SPEAKER_10]: There are three new fighters available.

1632
02:05:55,027 --> 02:05:56,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Balrog, Vega, and Cody.

1633
02:05:57,069 --> 02:06:00,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind that when Street Fighter 4 was ported to the iPhone, not all the fighters from the

1634
02:06:01,314 --> 02:06:02,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1635
02:06:27,425 --> 02:06:27,825
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do it.

1636
02:06:29,366 --> 02:06:30,707
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Street Fighter IV Volt.

1637
02:06:31,307 --> 02:06:35,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, in retro gaming's getting upgrades, Boulder Dash.

1638
02:06:35,949 --> 02:06:37,249
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember this game, Boulder Dash?

1639
02:06:37,409 --> 02:06:41,651
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember this because this was huge on the Commodore 64, was the series Boulder Dash.

1640
02:06:41,671 --> 02:06:49,334
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think a lot of the old PC, not PC, sorry, old computing platforms like the Apples and so forth, this game saw some type of port on it.

1641
02:06:49,374 --> 02:06:50,575
[SPEAKER_10]: These games were huge back in the 80s.

1642
02:06:51,235 --> 02:06:53,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's getting a remake, I guess you could say.

1643
02:06:53,276 --> 02:06:54,577
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an HD update.

1644
02:06:54,657 --> 02:06:57,758
[SPEAKER_10]: It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon, July 13th.

1645
02:06:58,699 --> 02:07:01,840
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be just shy of the Summer Arcade promotion.

1646
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:03,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, it's going to be going up against Ms.

1647
02:07:03,881 --> 02:07:07,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Splosion Man, so it might fall through the cracks a little bit.

1648
02:07:07,523 --> 02:07:14,126
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you're fond of the old game on the 64 or whatever computer back in the day, Boulder Dash XL is on its way.

1649
02:07:14,826 --> 02:07:40,418
[SPEAKER_10]: it will have 7 times the amount of caves as the original 1984 version it's coming out from Calypso Media there will be a new puzzle mode with items like speed enhancers and telescoping arms, online leaderboards it will set you back 800 Microsoft points there will also be a PC version late in the summer if you are a personal computing purist and you don't want to play the game on one of those evil consoles

1650
02:07:41,718 --> 02:07:42,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1651
02:07:56,664 --> 02:07:57,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1652
02:08:13,292 --> 02:08:25,757
[SPEAKER_10]: This all coming out from an interview with Zelda longtime producer Eiji Onuma, who said, so when we show a graphic demo, people think, oh, this is what the next Zelda will look like, but that's not necessarily the case.

1653
02:08:26,457 --> 02:08:30,758
[SPEAKER_10]: And they also cite, again, the Wind Waker GameCube comparison there.

1654
02:08:31,179 --> 02:08:34,740
[SPEAKER_10]: So confirmed, we use Zelda to be cel-shaded, right?

1655
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:36,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, maybe not quite.

1656
02:08:37,861 --> 02:08:38,981
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1657
02:08:39,662 --> 02:08:40,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Broadband!

1658
02:08:42,659 --> 02:08:43,760
[SPEAKER_07]: New download content!

1659
02:08:44,821 --> 02:08:54,390
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be For What It's Worth by Buffalo Springfield, Man on the Moon by R.E.M., Aerials by System of the Down, Hypnotized by System of the Down, and Turning Japanese by The Vapors.

1660
02:08:55,491 --> 02:09:04,379
[SPEAKER_07]: And for Aerials and Turning Japanese and For What It's Worth, there will be pro guitar bass expansions available for another 80 Microsoft points.

1661
02:09:05,512 --> 02:09:05,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

1662
02:09:06,892 --> 02:09:11,054
[SPEAKER_07]: And next up, Final Fantasy Tactics for the iOS is delayed.

1663
02:09:11,574 --> 02:09:13,914
[SPEAKER_07]: That's according to Sequenix's Facebook page.

1664
02:09:14,274 --> 02:09:21,557
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs a little bit more time, so it's going to be in late July instead of June, as they said it would.

1665
02:09:21,657 --> 02:09:22,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that might be a little old.

1666
02:09:24,466 --> 02:09:27,368
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have the bare minimum of an iPhone 3GS to play it.

1667
02:09:28,169 --> 02:09:32,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the remake of the PlayStation 1 version, so it's the good one.

1668
02:09:33,372 --> 02:09:36,775
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, last but not least, oh, you addict people.

1669
02:09:37,475 --> 02:09:38,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Minecraft!

1670
02:09:38,596 --> 02:09:42,759
[SPEAKER_07]: They passed 10 million registered users.

1671
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:47,482
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's according to Marcus Persson's blog.

1672
02:09:48,383 --> 02:09:51,165
[SPEAKER_07]: So they are now officially at 10,005,304.

1673
02:09:52,646 --> 02:09:59,190
[SPEAKER_07]: The people who've actually bought it are in the 2 million range.

1674
02:10:00,511 --> 02:10:01,492
[SPEAKER_10]: That's still pretty good.

1675
02:10:01,812 --> 02:10:03,093
[SPEAKER_10]: 2 million copies of the game.

1676
02:10:03,333 --> 02:10:04,634
[SPEAKER_10]: One out of every five are buying it.

1677
02:10:05,495 --> 02:10:05,955
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not bad.

1678
02:10:07,611 --> 02:10:14,382
[SPEAKER_07]: But they say that basically they're getting 42,000 new players registering in the last 24 hours.

1679
02:10:15,664 --> 02:10:16,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I take my registration back?

1680
02:10:17,547 --> 02:10:18,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

1681
02:10:18,088 --> 02:10:19,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not that big a jerk, I promise.

1682
02:10:21,636 --> 02:10:22,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yay for Minecraft.

1683
02:10:22,657 --> 02:10:23,737
[SPEAKER_10]: And yay for our Twitter.

1684
02:10:23,817 --> 02:10:28,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week you guys send us tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

1685
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:30,261
[SPEAKER_10]: And we read some of your tweets here live on air.

1686
02:10:31,262 --> 02:10:32,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a lot of tweets tonight, actually.

1687
02:10:32,763 --> 02:10:35,565
[SPEAKER_10]: There's like not a lot of Twitter news tonight.

1688
02:10:36,385 --> 02:10:48,073
[SPEAKER_10]: MNZiba says this tweet saying, Xenoblade or Monado, beginning of the world, is actually number three on the best sellers in Nintendo Wii action games list at Amazon.com.

1689
02:10:48,973 --> 02:10:51,675
[SPEAKER_10]: and she gives us a link here to Amazon.com bestsellers.

1690
02:10:52,236 --> 02:10:54,257
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually up to number two now, just so you know.

1691
02:10:55,478 --> 02:11:06,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Smash Brothers Brawl is the game that's beating it and it in turn is beating, Monado is beating Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Lego Star Wars.

1692
02:11:08,112 --> 02:11:09,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So, interesting.

1693
02:11:09,253 --> 02:11:13,256
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, granted, keep in mind, we are looking at just the action game list.

1694
02:11:13,356 --> 02:11:15,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see where it ranks overall.

1695
02:11:15,918 --> 02:11:19,781
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at the overall list, and it's number 16.

1696
02:11:21,583 --> 02:11:32,411
[SPEAKER_10]: That's still not bad overall, but just so you know, overall, Monado is being beat by a Wii Nunchuck controller in black and the HD component cable, which is number 8.

1697
02:11:35,366 --> 02:11:42,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Another tweet to us from TigerClaw sends us a tweet saying, Space station internet too slow for online video games.

1698
02:11:45,028 --> 02:11:47,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, it links us to a Kotaku article here.

1699
02:11:47,769 --> 02:11:50,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Regarding life in space, everyone has three questions.

1700
02:11:50,069 --> 02:11:50,749
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you poop?

1701
02:11:50,789 --> 02:11:51,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Has anyone screwed?

1702
02:11:51,610 --> 02:11:53,110
[SPEAKER_10]: And can you play video games up there?

1703
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:54,890
[SPEAKER_07]: They poop in a vacuum tube.

1704
02:11:55,710 --> 02:11:56,051
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true.

1705
02:11:56,171 --> 02:11:58,711
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura would know the answer to that.

1706
02:11:59,111 --> 02:12:02,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, a Canadian astronaut, I didn't know they had astronauts in Canada.

1707
02:12:04,878 --> 02:12:06,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Canadians in Space.

1708
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:08,041
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be a great sitcom.

1709
02:12:08,701 --> 02:12:17,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield said that the internet connection aboard the International Space Station is simply too slow for games.

1710
02:12:18,089 --> 02:12:20,831
[SPEAKER_10]: He compared it to a 56K dial-up modem.

1711
02:12:21,251 --> 02:12:25,735
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess the reason why it stinks is because of the space station's orbital velocity speed.

1712
02:12:26,175 --> 02:12:29,038
[SPEAKER_10]: That thing moves at five miles per second.

1713
02:12:29,598 --> 02:12:31,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Because keep in mind, it's orbiting the Earth.

1714
02:12:32,561 --> 02:12:39,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Hadfield was the first Canadian to walk in space, and he's in line anyway to become the first Canadian commander of the space station.

1715
02:12:39,746 --> 02:12:41,047
[SPEAKER_10]: And clearly he must be a gamer.

1716
02:12:41,888 --> 02:12:46,211
[SPEAKER_10]: This all came out during a Canada Day event in Edmonton, so thank you for the link, Tigerclaw.

1717
02:12:47,192 --> 02:12:48,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Blinder says this is a tweet.

1718
02:12:49,453 --> 02:12:54,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Blinder222, to be specific, on Twitter, says, Did any of you play the Uncharted 3 beta?

1719
02:12:55,899 --> 02:12:56,079
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1720
02:12:56,159 --> 02:12:56,199
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1721
02:12:56,219 --> 02:12:56,299
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1722
02:13:11,776 --> 02:13:12,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I think.

1723
02:13:12,497 --> 02:13:15,799
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm assuming because it appeared on my... Just fucking download it if you're going to get it.

1724
02:13:15,819 --> 02:13:16,859
[SPEAKER_10]: The servers are fine now.

1725
02:13:16,919 --> 02:13:29,427
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it appeared on my download list now, but it's just... I have my PlayStation up in the front room and I have to drag an Ethernet cable because remember, old-ass PlayStation, no Wi-Fi built in because it's a 20 gig.

1726
02:13:30,208 --> 02:13:33,910
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to put an Ethernet cable, drag it into the front room and

1727
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:36,161
[SPEAKER_11]: See you last night.

1728
02:13:36,181 --> 02:13:38,645
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to play Earth Defense Force online as well.

1729
02:13:38,685 --> 02:13:43,552
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, I can do that with my console, but for some reason I wanted to plug it in.

1730
02:13:45,672 --> 02:13:52,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, I'm going to check it out hopefully in the next week But I tell you guys, I have a backlog of games to play I still have Loki's L.A.

1731
02:13:52,297 --> 02:14:09,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Noire I haven't even touched yet And I have two racing games that I have for my rental service And I have touched none of it Because I've been playing this new Warcraft patch I've been playing the other games I've been talking about And Final Fantasy XIII I'm up to 30 hours in Final Fantasy XIII Rob, are your racing games PS3?

1732
02:14:09,190 --> 02:14:09,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of them?

1733
02:14:09,810 --> 02:14:11,911
[SPEAKER_10]: They're Xbox 360, but they're from my rental service.

1734
02:14:12,172 --> 02:14:13,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was gonna save.

1735
02:14:14,453 --> 02:14:16,835
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got, like, a huge driving setup for PS3.

1736
02:14:17,215 --> 02:14:17,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, fine.

1737
02:14:17,995 --> 02:14:18,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Nah, it's 360.

1738
02:14:19,870 --> 02:14:25,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Test Drive Unlimited 2, and one of the Need for Speed games.

1739
02:14:25,672 --> 02:14:26,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Shift 2 Unleashed?

1740
02:14:27,592 --> 02:14:28,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it Hot Pursuit?

1741
02:14:28,873 --> 02:14:29,733
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's Hot Pursuit.

1742
02:14:29,873 --> 02:14:30,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to look.

1743
02:14:31,174 --> 02:14:31,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

1744
02:14:34,174 --> 02:14:37,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't Hot Pursuit the one they just announced that isn't even out yet?

1745
02:14:37,455 --> 02:14:40,036
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Hot Pursuit is the one that came out last year.

1746
02:14:40,076 --> 02:14:41,737
[SPEAKER_10]: That one looks badass, I gotta say.

1747
02:14:41,817 --> 02:14:43,157
[SPEAKER_10]: That new one looks fucking rad.

1748
02:14:43,878 --> 02:14:46,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Hot Pursuit is the one that came out back in November.

1749
02:14:46,422 --> 02:14:50,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Shift to Unleashed was the one that's sort of like Project Gotham that came out back in March.

1750
02:14:50,849 --> 02:14:53,253
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, yeah, The Run is the one that's coming out later on.

1751
02:14:53,616 --> 02:14:57,579
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, at some point I will get to Uncharted 3 before they close the beta.

1752
02:14:57,839 --> 02:15:05,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually have a pretty big gaming queue right now of stuff I want to play, and I'm still trying to beat Final Fantasy XIII, which is just, I'm so into it right now.

1753
02:15:05,485 --> 02:15:06,666
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's spreading.

1754
02:15:06,686 --> 02:15:09,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you see Bobby Blackwolf, our guy before us here?

1755
02:15:09,468 --> 02:15:10,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I should finish mine.

1756
02:15:10,789 --> 02:15:12,170
[SPEAKER_10]: He posted a tweet last night.

1757
02:15:12,210 --> 02:15:13,130
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, you know what?

1758
02:15:14,151 --> 02:15:16,212
[SPEAKER_10]: After a year, it's time for me to beat Chapter 10.

1759
02:15:16,912 --> 02:15:19,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is funny, because I didn't struggle on that same boss fight.

1760
02:15:19,273 --> 02:15:21,654
[SPEAKER_10]: There were boss fights I struggled on, but not that one.

1761
02:15:22,294 --> 02:15:26,916
[SPEAKER_10]: There were some Eidolon fights that made me want to just... I'll have Sazh's Eidolon.

1762
02:15:29,137 --> 02:15:31,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, I went crazy on that fight, just so you know.

1763
02:15:32,038 --> 02:15:33,119
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to find my save.

1764
02:15:33,159 --> 02:15:36,600
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on one of the hard drives I have, because I've swapped hard drives around.

1765
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's not on that console, because that's the internal hard drive.

1766
02:15:40,942 --> 02:15:43,143
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have to track it down, and once I do, then I'll play it.

1767
02:15:45,046 --> 02:15:47,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on.

1768
02:15:47,767 --> 02:15:51,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Another tweet, last tweet here from TigerClaw305 on Twitter.

1769
02:15:52,470 --> 02:15:55,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Professor Layton Movie is getting a US release.

1770
02:15:56,172 --> 02:15:59,253
[SPEAKER_10]: And, oh, I hate these websites that have ads you have to click through.

1771
02:16:00,234 --> 02:16:00,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1772
02:16:02,475 --> 02:16:03,135
[SPEAKER_10]: See how they do that, Nintendo?

1773
02:16:03,155 --> 02:16:07,316
[SPEAKER_10]: They release something that's English language and release it in British markets, isn't it?

1774
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:30,565
[SPEAKER_11]: they can come over here without any effort whatsoever because it's already translated into English.

1775
02:16:31,046 --> 02:16:38,653
[SPEAKER_10]: As revealed at Anime Expo 2011 this weekend the feature length animated film is on its way to North America reports Anime Your Way.

1776
02:16:39,234 --> 02:16:44,780
[SPEAKER_10]: It was actually fairly well received and the developer Level 5 has already commissioned a sequel and would like a new movie out annually.

1777
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:52,826
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to add also, seeing as we're talking about anime movies coming out soon, they announced a Trigun movie coming out, and that's awesome.

1778
02:16:52,846 --> 02:16:54,227
[SPEAKER_08]: The trailer, did you watch it?

1779
02:16:54,307 --> 02:16:54,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I did.

1780
02:16:55,208 --> 02:16:55,588
[SPEAKER_08]: So nice.

1781
02:16:56,489 --> 02:17:00,852
[SPEAKER_11]: It will take place, obviously, during the series, for obvious reasons.

1782
02:17:04,875 --> 02:17:05,716
[SPEAKER_11]: But that is very exciting.

1783
02:17:06,021 --> 02:17:07,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, that's it for Twitter topics tonight.

1784
02:17:07,382 --> 02:17:08,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get back to some other gaming news.

1785
02:17:08,722 --> 02:17:09,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1786
02:17:09,282 --> 02:17:13,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's talk a little bit about Minecraft since we were just talking about Minecraft not too long ago.

1787
02:17:14,404 --> 02:17:20,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Minecraft 1.7 is out now and it adds pistons and deadly sheep.

1788
02:17:20,146 --> 02:17:22,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know.

1789
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:24,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Black Sheep, Pistons, Minecraft

02:17:41,858 --> 02:17:47,283

[SPEAKER_11]: And 1.8 would add the Minecraft Adventure mode.

1792
02:17:52,607 --> 02:17:54,468
[SPEAKER_11]: And that'll be coming very soon.

1793
02:17:54,548 --> 02:17:59,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, 1.8 is released in the next few months.

1794
02:17:59,733 --> 02:18:05,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're saying that they're also starting the crunch for the full release, which is going to be on 11.11.11.

1795
02:18:05,377 --> 02:18:05,417
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1796
02:18:09,349 --> 02:18:09,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, neat.

1797
02:18:10,190 --> 02:18:21,977
[SPEAKER_11]: And the adventure mode, I believe, was where you can actually create your own... I know that they've added maps recently, but maybe you can make your own Zelda-type game or something.

1798
02:18:22,938 --> 02:18:23,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Should be kind of neat.

1799
02:18:25,420 --> 02:18:26,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely adding a lot more stuff to this.

1800
02:18:26,941 --> 02:18:29,322
[SPEAKER_11]: At some point, I'll have to check it out.

1801
02:18:30,143 --> 02:18:30,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Just not yet.

1802
02:18:32,589 --> 02:18:39,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, DDR News, DarkToagag wants to know, before I get to DDR News, does Loki have Minecraft?

1803
02:18:39,334 --> 02:18:41,575
[SPEAKER_10]: That's from our chatroom.

1804
02:18:42,316 --> 02:18:44,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I have it on my iPod, actually.

1805
02:18:44,737 --> 02:18:45,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's interesting.

1806
02:18:45,778 --> 02:18:51,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, that one Minecraft app or whatever that came out and they got pulled immediately?

1807
02:18:52,022 --> 02:18:53,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I found it.

1808
02:18:53,583 --> 02:18:57,786
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I have that, but I haven't really, I mean, trying to use it on an iPod is just...

1809
02:18:59,167 --> 02:19:04,974
[SPEAKER_11]: that's retarded no I haven't really played it yet I thought I had downloaded it at one point but I guess not

1810
02:19:06,761 --> 02:19:10,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Dance Revolution X3 vs. Dance Dance Revolution 2nd Mix

1811
02:19:31,314 --> 02:19:41,968
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be a second mix mode in the game where you can play the full version of Dance Dance Revolution second mix including all the licensed music that appeared in that game.

1812
02:19:42,725 --> 02:19:43,245
[SPEAKER_10]: E-Amusement Capability

1813
02:20:02,077 --> 02:20:05,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, X3 is really the highlight, and that's the game they want you to play.

1814
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:23,130
[SPEAKER_10]: 480 tracks in total, standard DDR music, mix, songs, let's see, a variety of Bomani artists, transplant songs from other Bomani series, eAmusementGate, a community-oriented website for Konami games that allows players to form groups, share scores, and interact with other players.

1815
02:20:23,150 --> 02:20:24,391
[SPEAKER_10]: That actually sounds kind of cool.

1816
02:20:25,972 --> 02:20:27,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Will it make an arcade here?

1817
02:20:27,433 --> 02:20:27,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1818
02:20:28,113 --> 02:20:29,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Could it get a home release that good?

1819
02:20:29,935 --> 02:20:30,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Doubt it.

1820
02:20:31,618 --> 02:20:34,260
[SPEAKER_11]: See, that's the... Why can't I get that as a home release?

1821
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:54,517
[SPEAKER_11]: See, this is what pisses us off so much, is like, they put all this effort into DDR for the arcade, which, you know, we would love to believe that the arcade is still, you know, a viable place to have these type of games, but at the same time, they can't just strictly port this to the home console.

1822
02:20:54,897 --> 02:20:56,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever happened with the problem being...

1823
02:20:58,039 --> 02:21:03,760
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, back in the PlayStation 1 days, just take the arcade release, you bring it home, and you add a couple things.

1824
02:21:04,001 --> 02:21:04,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Done.

1825
02:21:04,821 --> 02:21:05,261
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

1826
02:21:05,701 --> 02:21:06,341
[SPEAKER_11]: People loved it.

1827
02:21:06,821 --> 02:21:08,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do you gotta change it up now?

1828
02:21:08,842 --> 02:21:09,642
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand the point.

1829
02:21:12,202 --> 02:21:18,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's because probably licensing 480 songs for home would be a little bit expensive, I guess.

1830
02:21:19,064 --> 02:21:19,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1831
02:21:21,585 --> 02:21:24,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, I'm curious about this whole second mix.

1832
02:21:24,988 --> 02:21:31,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, second mix, just to put it in perspective for those that haven't followed DDR like we have, it's like 11 years old.

1833
02:21:31,673 --> 02:21:34,215
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the first one I owned, was second mix on Dreamcast.

1834
02:21:34,255 --> 02:21:37,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so it's weird that they're kind of going back to that.

1835
02:21:37,258 --> 02:21:41,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, dude, I wonder if second mix will have, what was that fucking mode that's only in second mix, Jamie?

1836
02:21:41,841 --> 02:21:43,082
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like your favorite fucking mode.

1837
02:21:43,162 --> 02:21:43,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.

1838
02:21:43,843 --> 02:21:44,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance battle.

1839
02:21:44,524 --> 02:21:45,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance battle.

1840
02:21:45,244 --> 02:21:46,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that'll come back.

1841
02:21:46,445 --> 02:21:46,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1842
02:21:46,685 --> 02:21:47,486
[SPEAKER_10]: That would actually be kind of rad.

1843
02:21:47,506 --> 02:21:48,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Battle was awesome.

1844
02:21:48,787 --> 02:21:54,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Battle's the one where you would have a measure where you could just make up your own steps, and then the other player had to do them.

1845
02:21:54,531 --> 02:21:54,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1846
02:21:54,871 --> 02:21:58,373
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could just... But you could only have, like, two things at any beat at a time.

1847
02:21:58,673 --> 02:22:03,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, you couldn't go too shit crazy, but they would have to do whatever you just did.

1848
02:22:03,657 --> 02:22:06,219
[SPEAKER_07]: But we used to just try to fuck each other's day.

1849
02:22:06,699 --> 02:22:09,621
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, on top of that, there was no vivid.

1850
02:22:10,542 --> 02:22:12,103
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all flat.

1851
02:22:13,103 --> 02:22:13,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh.

1852
02:22:13,664 --> 02:22:13,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh.

1853
02:22:14,875 --> 02:22:15,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1854
02:22:40,038 --> 02:22:42,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really curious to see how this translates in the arcades, but we'll see.

1855
02:22:42,962 --> 02:22:44,044
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll fuck it up somehow.

1856
02:22:44,985 --> 02:22:46,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Prove me wrong, Konami, I dare you.

1857
02:22:46,407 --> 02:22:50,593
[SPEAKER_07]: You should play Strictly Businesses or Transfer Music after birth.

1858
02:22:50,913 --> 02:22:51,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Remind me after the show.

1859
02:22:52,015 --> 02:22:52,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, moving on.

1860
02:22:55,583 --> 02:22:56,284
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, right?

1861
02:22:56,744 --> 02:22:57,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.

1862
02:22:57,304 --> 02:22:57,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1863
02:22:58,265 --> 02:22:59,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop playing on Facebook.

1864
02:22:59,546 --> 02:23:00,526
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to do a show.

1865
02:23:00,847 --> 02:23:01,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Nah.

1866
02:23:01,727 --> 02:23:04,249
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, can I say something that's pissing me off about Facebook right now?

1867
02:23:04,409 --> 02:23:04,629
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1868
02:23:05,149 --> 02:23:06,690
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still not in the Civ World beta.

1869
02:23:07,090 --> 02:23:08,011
[SPEAKER_10]: That pisses me off.

1870
02:23:08,851 --> 02:23:09,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

1871
02:23:09,712 --> 02:23:10,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Rob.

1872
02:23:10,853 --> 02:23:11,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm mad.

1873
02:23:11,973 --> 02:23:12,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be mad.

1874
02:23:13,374 --> 02:23:13,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Get even.

1875
02:23:15,696 --> 02:23:17,076
[SPEAKER_07]: So, guess what?

1876
02:23:18,237 --> 02:23:24,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Kazuo Hirai is now the chairman of Sony SCEI.

1877
02:23:25,891 --> 02:23:28,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he's now the head doo-doo in charge

1878
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:33,422
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess who is replacing him as group CEO?

1879
02:23:34,502 --> 02:23:35,583
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be Andrew House.

1880
02:23:36,223 --> 02:23:37,063
[SPEAKER_07]: He's taking over.

1881
02:23:37,644 --> 02:23:42,146
[SPEAKER_07]: But guess what's happening to Ken Kutaragi, the crayon eater and helmet wearer?

1882
02:23:42,686 --> 02:23:44,207
[SPEAKER_07]: He's retiring for reals.

1883
02:23:44,807 --> 02:23:47,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Except he's going to hang around as senior technology advisor.

1884
02:23:47,689 --> 02:23:51,891
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to a very special home where they serve crayons for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

1885
02:23:52,891 --> 02:23:56,113
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to be eating the rest of his dinner through straws.

1886
02:23:58,418 --> 02:23:59,300
[SPEAKER_07]: For the rest of his life.

1887
02:24:00,042 --> 02:24:03,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they don't give you food that you can hurt yourself with in the home.

1888
02:24:05,868 --> 02:24:07,109
[SPEAKER_07]: He's gonna be eating some Gerber!

1889
02:24:08,269 --> 02:24:34,104
[SPEAKER_07]: No, um, but yeah, he actually, uh, did retire, but he's remaining behind as Senior Technology Advisor, and, yeah, it seems like a really crappy time to do, like, oh, you just, uh, have the most insecure system ever, blah blah blah, oh, here's a promotion, but really the fact is that, um, Akira Sato retired, so that's why they're shoving people up.

1890
02:24:37,611 --> 02:24:41,393
[SPEAKER_10]: We knew there was going to be a management shakeup coming though after everything that they went through the past few months.

1891
02:24:41,413 --> 02:24:43,914
[SPEAKER_07]: But I thought it would be deserved firings.

1892
02:24:45,554 --> 02:24:46,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Sackings.

1893
02:24:47,055 --> 02:24:48,596
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the word sacking a little more.

1894
02:24:50,597 --> 02:24:52,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like them to be rendered redundant.

1895
02:24:53,798 --> 02:24:54,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, moving on.

1896
02:24:54,658 --> 02:24:55,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what do you got for us?

1897
02:24:57,534 --> 02:25:00,476
[SPEAKER_10]: We were talking... You're watching the Giggling Girls video, aren't you?

1898
02:25:00,676 --> 02:25:01,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I am.

1899
02:25:02,558 --> 02:25:04,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, it's so awesome!

1900
02:25:04,839 --> 02:25:06,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, it's GLaDOS!

1901
02:25:06,321 --> 02:25:08,422
[SPEAKER_11]: And now for two giggling schoolgirls!

1902
02:25:09,903 --> 02:25:12,465
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, that is the third podcast that OLR is working on.

1903
02:25:12,525 --> 02:25:13,946
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Giggling Girls Playing Video Games.

1904
02:25:14,247 --> 02:25:14,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

1905
02:25:15,668 --> 02:25:17,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't that be the Giggling Lesbian Show?

1906
02:25:18,310 --> 02:25:19,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish, if they still lived here.

1907
02:25:21,723 --> 02:25:46,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, the PSP remaster titles that were announced during both E3 and their own events, they're basically able to do this because of the help of a PSP engine that's a software development kit that Sony put out regarding these PSP remaster titles that allows them to be able to port them into HD.

1908
02:25:47,613 --> 02:26:14,643
[SPEAKER_11]: and with high resolution rendering, stereoscopic 3D and wireless controller support for DualShock 3 and apparently they haven't announced any more remastered titles other than Monster Hunter Portable 3rd and then also of course there's I mean they call it the remastered title but the God of War Origins Collection which is coming out that's basically the two PSP God of War games um

1909
02:26:16,277 --> 02:26:16,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Funny!

1910
02:26:26,573 --> 02:26:27,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry I'm slow.

1911
02:26:27,333 --> 02:26:30,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm chatting with listeners about Final Fantasy XIII.

1912
02:26:30,274 --> 02:26:31,915
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about what parties we use.

1913
02:26:32,555 --> 02:26:39,857
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're telling me that... Somebody... Who's telling me that they use... Dungeon Buster is saying I think it's Lightning, Saws, and Vanilla.

1914
02:26:39,877 --> 02:26:41,017
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, who do you have as a Sentinel?

1915
02:26:41,037 --> 02:26:42,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you don't have a Sentinel in that party.

1916
02:26:42,598 --> 02:26:43,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you have to have Fang or Snow.

1917
02:26:44,198 --> 02:26:45,999
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't use Snow because he's a whiny vagina.

1918
02:26:46,299 --> 02:26:47,799
[SPEAKER_10]: But I like Fang because she's hardcore.

1919
02:26:47,839 --> 02:26:48,820
[SPEAKER_10]: So I use her as my Sentinel.

1920
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:49,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1921
02:26:50,615 --> 02:26:51,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, PSP remasters.

1922
02:26:51,916 --> 02:26:52,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

1923
02:26:52,316 --> 02:26:52,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool deal.

1924
02:26:53,978 --> 02:26:55,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Any of those worth getting, you think?

1925
02:26:56,520 --> 02:27:02,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Um... I didn't really play Monster Hunter and God of War... I don't know.

1926
02:27:02,345 --> 02:27:04,787
[SPEAKER_11]: God of War would be fun to play, I guess.

1927
02:27:05,247 --> 02:27:08,670
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't really played in... I only think I went through all the way in 2.

1928
02:27:09,871 --> 02:27:14,855
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I didn't play all the way through in 1 because my... It glitched out in 1.

1929
02:27:15,096 --> 02:27:17,338
[SPEAKER_11]: At the very last boss.

1930
02:27:20,465 --> 02:27:45,934
[SPEAKER_10]: um going on to anticipated games Gears of War 3 has leaked to the internet already uh oh this is a uh not a finalized build by the way but it does have the full campaign and there are some multiplayer modes this could be the E3 build of the game but not sure uh they say it's a developer build or what they call oh and you've heard this term on the show before a JTAG version of the game

1931
02:27:46,374 --> 02:27:49,616
[SPEAKER_10]: You may need a special modified Xbox 360 or dev kit to run it.

1932
02:27:49,756 --> 02:27:55,739
[SPEAKER_10]: But Loki would never indulge in that because that would be wrong to download that and play that.

1933
02:27:55,899 --> 02:27:56,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that would be wrong.

1934
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:06,646
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a developer version of the game because JTAGS basically can operate like a developer's console.

1935
02:28:07,386 --> 02:28:08,887
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a dev kit too, so that'd be...

1936
02:28:09,702 --> 02:28:37,251
[SPEAKER_11]: so if you're trying to keep yourself spoiler free on Gears of War 3 stories you might want to leave the internet you might want to take a break from the internet for about 6 months or whenever this game is supposed to come out yeah, careful because they do have a bunch of different I guess builds in here they have a testing, shipping, release and then multiplayer so they're testing a bunch of different things

1937
02:28:38,888 --> 02:29:05,030
[SPEAKER_10]: by the way I love having a podcast can I just say that I love this like you know I was just bitching a minute ago that I'm not playing Civ World and one of the listeners just said oh there's an invite in your inbox now aww love the internet love it I love it I wish Google Plus had been that easy if I didn't invite you like during that 90 minute window that one night you got screwed I didn't get my invite I know cause they shut it off like I cannot invite people now to Google Plus fucking retarded

1938
02:29:05,991 --> 02:29:08,374
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be opened up soon for others.

1939
02:29:08,874 --> 02:29:10,376
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1940
02:29:11,057 --> 02:29:12,338
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not a lot on there right now.

1941
02:29:12,678 --> 02:29:15,762
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, you know, yay, I'm on Google Plus and it's not Facebook.

1942
02:29:15,802 --> 02:29:18,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that's what every status update I see on there is right now.

1943
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:19,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's not Facebook.

1944
02:29:20,987 --> 02:29:24,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, it's not Facebook, but is 10 times more awesome is our mailbag.

1945
02:29:26,092 --> 02:29:31,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Every week DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and dives in and reads some emails.

1946
02:29:32,418 --> 02:29:35,021
[SPEAKER_10]: She's going to share them with you right now if she can stop playing on Tumblr.

1947
02:29:36,342 --> 02:29:38,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm putting something important to other artists on there.

1948
02:29:40,046 --> 02:29:41,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I will tell you what it is because it's actually pretty cool.

1949
02:29:42,028 --> 02:29:48,775
[SPEAKER_07]: The iCloud logo is actually using the golden ratio as its design background.

1950
02:29:48,795 --> 02:29:49,155
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway.

1951
02:29:50,961 --> 02:30:00,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Implications of Brown vs. EMA ruling.

1952
02:30:00,807 --> 02:30:02,528
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll talk the subject to death this week.

1953
02:30:02,628 --> 02:30:08,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I find whenever I try to explain this to a non-gamer, they not only don't care, but they think it doesn't affect them.

1954
02:30:08,832 --> 02:30:18,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time they play Solitaire, Farmville, Bejeweled, take an online test, give games to their kids, or anything else software related, they're doing so without fear of breaking a bunch of state-by-state laws.

1955
02:30:19,198 --> 02:30:24,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Soon we won't do anything without some sort of interactive media, be it a question or a controller.

1956
02:30:24,561 --> 02:30:26,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It affects everyone in the USA.

1957
02:30:26,202 --> 02:30:28,023
[SPEAKER_07]: My two bits without repeating a story.

1958
02:30:30,224 --> 02:30:31,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I've given him some more babas.

1959
02:30:33,620 --> 02:30:43,786
[SPEAKER_07]: And, okay, there is a couple, actually one from Game Politics, another story that he linked, about Star Wars Galaxy's players filing a class action lawsuit.

1960
02:30:44,266 --> 02:30:44,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, really?

1961
02:30:45,447 --> 02:30:46,588
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know more about that, actually.

1962
02:30:46,808 --> 02:30:49,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the game is shutting down soon, right?

1963
02:30:49,870 --> 02:30:51,110
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're filing class action lawsuits?

1964
02:30:51,171 --> 02:30:51,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

1965
02:30:51,951 --> 02:30:53,632
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got to be lifetime subscriptions, isn't it?

1966
02:30:55,831 --> 02:31:03,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically it says that more than 50 Star Wars Galaxies players are filing a class action lawsuit against Sony.

1967
02:31:04,613 --> 02:31:09,014
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are a bunch of other players that says that they will do the same thing.

1968
02:31:11,215 --> 02:31:15,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Sony is shutting down... They basically are having their petitions go out.

1969
02:31:15,195 --> 02:31:19,877
[SPEAKER_07]: But the problem is that they agreed that Sony could cancel the game at any time.

1970
02:31:20,437 --> 02:31:20,717
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1971
02:31:22,217 --> 02:31:23,818
[SPEAKER_10]: and their SOL.

1972
02:31:23,938 --> 02:31:27,900
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty sure that's in the terms of service for any MMO, even Warcraft.

1973
02:31:28,060 --> 02:31:29,301
[SPEAKER_10]: They can pull the plug at any time.

1974
02:31:29,601 --> 02:31:31,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember Warcraft shut down in China for four months?

1975
02:31:31,742 --> 02:31:32,362
[SPEAKER_10]: That could happen here.

1976
02:31:32,882 --> 02:31:33,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1977
02:31:33,262 --> 02:31:34,103
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't, but it could.

1978
02:31:35,211 --> 02:32:04,735
[SPEAKER_07]: well also about the whole Resident Evil Mercenaries basically Amazon customers are actually putting like huge huge negative reviews on Amazon like there is one person saying I don't care how much fun this game is or how good it looks or how much it costs there's one save slot save data is permanent and cannot be deleted Capcom is attempting to set a new precedent in consumer manipulation and control with this product

1979
02:32:07,256 --> 02:32:07,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1980
02:32:11,279 --> 02:32:16,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, Dear Sakura, Loki, and Roger.

1981
02:32:19,345 --> 02:32:19,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Roar!

1982
02:32:20,086 --> 02:32:21,167
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Roger Roberts.

1983
02:32:22,672 --> 02:32:27,977
[SPEAKER_07]: This week, a game company did slash said slash didn't do slash didn't say something.

1984
02:32:28,437 --> 02:32:30,919
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing is the worst thing in the history of the world and ever.

1985
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:31,960
[SPEAKER_07]: That's bad.

1986
02:32:32,421 --> 02:32:34,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Roar!

1987
02:32:34,883 --> 02:32:34,583
112.

1988
02:32:35,423 --> 02:32:36,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay Black, Red Entertainment.

1989
02:32:36,985 --> 02:32:38,746
[SPEAKER_07]: This message has been brought to you by Korn.

1990
02:32:39,046 --> 02:32:41,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Korn, great addition to tacos, bad addition to Silent Hill.

1991
02:32:42,069 --> 02:32:44,591
[SPEAKER_07]: After all, adding Korn to tacos has never caused haze.

1992
02:32:46,353 --> 02:32:47,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Sent from my iPad.

1993
02:32:48,976 --> 02:32:50,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm allergic to corn of all kinds.

1994
02:32:50,877 --> 02:32:53,919
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm assuming my name got auto-corrected to Roger.

1995
02:32:54,119 --> 02:32:55,900
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because Julian called you Roger.

1996
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:57,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's... He said, happy birthday, Roger.

1997
02:32:58,041 --> 02:32:58,562
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1998
02:32:58,902 --> 02:32:59,342
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1999
02:32:59,802 --> 02:33:00,303
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember now.

2000
02:33:00,883 --> 02:33:02,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, I forgot to bring back the cake plate.

2001
02:33:02,784 --> 02:33:05,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, by the way, a certain someone is listening right now.

2002
02:33:05,686 --> 02:33:06,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

2003
02:33:06,626 --> 02:33:09,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope the four-year-old's not listening with all our potty mouth language.

2004
02:33:13,330 --> 02:33:16,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't you say you wanted to say something to... I said it on Facebook.

2005
02:33:16,792 --> 02:33:16,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2006
02:33:16,912 --> 02:33:17,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care of that.

2007
02:33:18,007 --> 02:33:20,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I didn't know you wanted to say something publicly.

2008
02:33:20,208 --> 02:33:21,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for the cake.

2009
02:33:21,389 --> 02:33:23,690
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I expressed that last week.

2010
02:33:23,750 --> 02:33:24,591
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, it's fine.

2011
02:33:25,932 --> 02:33:28,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this is from Chiggers, which that's the worst nickname ever.

2012
02:33:28,813 --> 02:33:30,254
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I love that nickname.

2013
02:33:31,215 --> 02:33:32,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what those are?

2014
02:33:32,355 --> 02:33:44,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, is it something really... They're bugs that burrow under your skin and lay their eggs and infect under your skin and then the eggs hatch and they come out of your skin leaving these weird zombie-like trails on your arms.

2015
02:33:44,662 --> 02:33:45,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen it happen.

2016
02:33:46,209 --> 02:33:47,270
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of awesome, actually.

2017
02:33:47,290 --> 02:33:48,170
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really disgusting.

2018
02:33:49,191 --> 02:33:52,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear OLR, long-time listener, six years, first-time emailer.

2019
02:33:52,654 --> 02:33:53,374
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, hearts.

2020
02:33:54,875 --> 02:33:58,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I've noticed PS3 is now starting to put out TurboGrafx-16 games.

2021
02:33:58,498 --> 02:34:06,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it's possible they may try and get some games that were released out on the SNES or Saturn from any third-party publishers?

2022
02:34:06,204 --> 02:34:08,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep up the good work and belated happy ninth anniversary.

2023
02:34:08,826 --> 02:34:10,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Yours truly, in Horde House, Gildy, Chickers.

2024
02:34:12,168 --> 02:34:12,908
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

2025
02:34:32,233 --> 02:34:56,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, as far as the whole PlayStation 3, TurboGrafx-16 games No, they will not get games on the NES, SNES, or any of that Even if they were third party Even if they were third party because you're emulating the hardware that doesn't belong And so I think the whole licensing and all that would be I mean, they would have to completely redo the game Completely redo it And I just don't see that happening They're not gonna Yeah

2026
02:34:58,392 --> 02:35:01,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, never say never just like Nintendo.

2027
02:35:01,514 --> 02:35:05,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be hilarious if they did Saturn games on a PlayStation at all.

2028
02:35:06,258 --> 02:35:07,939
[SPEAKER_07]: That would just be lol.

2029
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:12,002
[SPEAKER_07]: The big competition was the Saturn and PlayStation back in the day.

2030
02:35:12,022 --> 02:35:13,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Or what about PlayStation games on a Dreamcast?

2031
02:35:15,121 --> 02:35:18,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I have three video games that I can play on my Dreamcast.

2032
02:35:18,164 --> 02:35:18,704
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the joke.

2033
02:35:18,884 --> 02:35:19,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it what?

2034
02:35:19,365 --> 02:35:20,806
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Tekken and Crazy Taxi?

2035
02:35:20,826 --> 02:35:24,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Tekken 3 and Crazy Taxi and Metal Gear.

2036
02:35:24,409 --> 02:35:25,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Metal Gear Solid.

2037
02:35:25,190 --> 02:35:25,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it really?

2038
02:35:25,650 --> 02:35:26,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was.

2039
02:35:26,130 --> 02:35:27,451
[SPEAKER_07]: That was all Bleemcast, by the way.

2040
02:35:27,471 --> 02:35:28,252
[SPEAKER_07]: They were Bleemcast.

2041
02:35:28,352 --> 02:35:30,694
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember when I tried to run Bleem on my PC.

2042
02:35:30,774 --> 02:35:35,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Granted, this was way back in the day and that did not work.

2043
02:35:35,338 --> 02:35:37,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when I had an emulator that worked better than Bleem.

2044
02:35:39,716 --> 02:35:53,239
[SPEAKER_07]: and we were trying to play Street Fighter EX3 that was lousy because it still ran like crap but yeah Tekken actually did look a lot better on Dreamcast just saying that's it

2045
02:35:54,540 --> 02:35:59,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Email us, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Make DarkSakura work more next week.

2046
02:35:59,202 --> 02:36:08,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Send us more emails, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Meanwhile, we do a segment here every week on the show that sometimes has to do with video games, sometimes not.

2047
02:36:08,246 --> 02:36:08,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

2048
02:36:08,586 --> 02:36:09,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we can.

2049
02:36:10,307 --> 02:36:10,827
[SPEAKER_10]: F-U's of the week!

2050
02:36:26,315 --> 02:36:28,716
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to everybody who's eating at Wendy's today, Rob.

2051
02:36:30,096 --> 02:36:30,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Haters gonna hate.

2052
02:36:31,116 --> 02:36:32,436
[SPEAKER_07]: For not bringing me a Frosty.

2053
02:36:33,697 --> 02:36:35,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I wanted a Frosty all day.

2054
02:36:35,837 --> 02:36:39,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't get a Frosty, but the berry tea was very good, I'm not gonna lie.

2055
02:36:39,218 --> 02:36:41,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I even told my husband to go get me a Frosty, and you know what he did?

2056
02:36:42,278 --> 02:36:44,139
[SPEAKER_07]: He went across the street and got a hamburger.

2057
02:36:45,019 --> 02:36:46,999
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he brought me one, and I just had a hot dog.

2058
02:36:47,059 --> 02:36:48,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, from your neighbors that are cooking?

2059
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:48,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2060
02:36:49,140 --> 02:36:50,080
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing our barbecue tomorrow.

2061
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:52,881
[SPEAKER_10]: You did tell the neighbors it's July 3rd, right?

2062
02:36:53,901 --> 02:36:54,381
[SPEAKER_07]: No one curve.

2063
02:36:56,698 --> 02:36:58,099
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to Wendy's for sucking.

2064
02:36:58,779 --> 02:36:59,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

2065
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:00,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they have terrible food.

2066
02:37:01,441 --> 02:37:06,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody send me a coupon for free Frosty since you gave Rob a Civ Beta thing.

2067
02:37:08,725 --> 02:37:10,746
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them is game related, the other is not.

2068
02:37:11,626 --> 02:37:12,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't care, I want a Frosty.

2069
02:37:13,247 --> 02:37:14,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Frosty's the best thing ever.

2070
02:37:14,448 --> 02:37:17,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know what Miklatov tried to convince me was a good idea once?

2071
02:37:17,796 --> 02:37:19,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Dipping your french fries into your Frosty?

2072
02:37:19,337 --> 02:37:21,657
[SPEAKER_10]: No, dipping chicken McNuggets into Frosty.

2073
02:37:22,378 --> 02:37:22,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Gross.

2074
02:37:22,658 --> 02:37:23,998
[SPEAKER_07]: What, the Wendy's don't have McNuggets?

2075
02:37:24,038 --> 02:37:25,059
[SPEAKER_10]: There's people that love that.

2076
02:37:25,079 --> 02:37:25,639
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean.

2077
02:37:25,659 --> 02:37:26,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Like chocolate shakes.

2078
02:37:26,599 --> 02:37:26,899
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob.

2079
02:37:27,139 --> 02:37:27,379
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2080
02:37:27,459 --> 02:37:28,140
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually is good.

2081
02:37:28,420 --> 02:37:28,800
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2082
02:37:29,140 --> 02:37:29,800
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gross.

2083
02:37:30,180 --> 02:37:33,742
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, Miklatov, hey, I don't know if he's still working.

2084
02:37:33,922 --> 02:37:35,322
[SPEAKER_11]: No, he doesn't still work at GameStop.

2085
02:37:35,462 --> 02:37:37,343
[SPEAKER_10]: No, he definitely does not work at GameStop.

2086
02:37:37,923 --> 02:37:40,784
[SPEAKER_11]: I need the DLC for Earth Defense Force.

2087
02:37:40,844 --> 02:37:43,765
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to pick up that pre-order shit somewhere.

2088
02:37:44,705 --> 02:38:11,848
[SPEAKER_10]: ask the listeners someone send me the DLC for Earth Defense Force and you will give them nothing a high five a handshake can't even do that alright my FU of the week goes to this is a work related FU because I don't want people thinking it has to do with other things it's work related FU to surprises work related surprises

2089
02:38:13,996 --> 02:38:15,336
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, that's really it.

2090
02:38:15,417 --> 02:38:16,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, things are actually pretty good.

2091
02:38:17,877 --> 02:38:18,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

2092
02:38:19,558 --> 02:38:20,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2093
02:38:21,118 --> 02:38:22,359
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is kind of neat.

2094
02:38:23,219 --> 02:38:26,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, unexpected, I guess, because life goes on, I guess.

2095
02:38:27,221 --> 02:38:31,222
[SPEAKER_11]: But Tokyo Game Show is going to have a pretty good showing this year.

2096
02:38:31,662 --> 02:38:35,503
[SPEAKER_11]: They're up to 146 exhibitors over the 138 in 2010.

2097
02:38:35,864 --> 02:38:41,906
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, people are like, earthquake and all the developers, they suffered from it.

2098
02:38:43,266 --> 02:38:47,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's going to be a while, and you know what?

2099
02:38:47,289 --> 02:38:48,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Life does go on.

2100
02:38:49,411 --> 02:38:51,352
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to be up.

2101
02:38:51,532 --> 02:38:57,077
[SPEAKER_11]: They're expecting to see, I guess, or they're going to try to reduce the power usage during the show.

2102
02:38:58,098 --> 02:39:02,801
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to drop it down 25% versus 2010 as well.

2103
02:39:04,622 --> 02:39:06,884
[SPEAKER_11]: But overall, it's going to have a really good showing.

2104
02:39:07,925 --> 02:39:09,106
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's pretty cool.

2105
02:39:12,202 --> 02:39:15,444
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great that it seems like it's going to be such a big, big show.

2106
02:39:15,525 --> 02:39:18,707
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's great that they're kind of bouncing with all that recovery stuff.

2107
02:39:18,727 --> 02:39:20,448
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm very happy to hear it, actually.

2108
02:39:21,309 --> 02:39:21,889
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

2109
02:39:23,971 --> 02:39:29,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on to one last story here about music, music-related stuff.

2110
02:39:29,775 --> 02:39:35,639
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, if you didn't already know about this, I imagine most of you listeners already have downloaded this and put them on their iPods.

2111
02:39:35,679 --> 02:39:37,120
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you are the one that has not...

2112
02:39:38,121 --> 02:39:40,824
[SPEAKER_10]: More Portal 2 free music is now available.

2113
02:39:40,964 --> 02:39:43,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Volume 2 of the Songs to Test By.

2114
02:39:44,307 --> 02:39:48,091
[SPEAKER_10]: 18 new tracks, 14 ringtones for your iPhone and Android devices.

2115
02:39:48,532 --> 02:39:50,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I had no idea there were ringtones in there.

2116
02:39:50,353 --> 02:39:51,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to look more carefully at this stuff.

2117
02:39:52,616 --> 02:39:53,316
[SPEAKER_10]: You can check that out.

2118
02:39:53,396 --> 02:39:58,742
[SPEAKER_10]: New songs include Bring Your Daughter to Work Day, I Am Not a Moron, and Potatoes Lament.

2119
02:39:59,301 --> 02:40:25,984
[SPEAKER_10]: which is actually really cool you can also have the orange or blue portal sound as your messaging ringtone unless you have an iPhone because you can't change your iPhone sounds that's why I didn't notice it yes you can only for the ones that they put on your phone oh yeah that's true volume 3 is coming soon how soon?

2120
02:40:26,204 --> 02:40:26,845
[SPEAKER_10]: I said soon

2121
02:40:28,726 --> 02:40:56,775
[SPEAKER_10]: also in music related news another Rockman Arrange album of course you know that, here's Mega Man Rockman Unity announced a new Rockman Arrange soundtrack We Are Rockman is the podcast it includes Mashihiro Aoki on guitar Yasumasa Kitagawa on bass he did work on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom All Stars

2122
02:40:57,495 --> 02:41:18,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Mitsuhiko, bleep bleep bloop maestro Takano on drums and there will be some guest musicians as well otherwise we don't have a lot of details about the album but some of basically Capcom's greats are getting together to do some rock band arranged music that'll be cool that kind of sounds like what the Black Mages did for Final Fantasy that's kind of what that sounds like to me so there you go

2123
02:41:20,103 --> 02:41:21,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, that does it for Gaming News tonight.

2124
02:41:22,084 --> 02:41:22,525
[SPEAKER_10]: We're done.

2125
02:41:23,205 --> 02:41:23,886
[SPEAKER_10]: We're out of here.

2126
02:41:24,706 --> 02:41:26,787
[SPEAKER_10]: But not until we open up the Skype line and take some calls.

2127
02:41:26,807 --> 02:41:29,349
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2128
02:41:29,389 --> 02:41:31,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us a call and you can talk with us.

2129
02:41:31,791 --> 02:41:35,813
[SPEAKER_10]: We can talk about any of the stories we've talked about tonight or maybe we missed something that you wanted to talk about.

2130
02:41:36,254 --> 02:41:43,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to talk about Nintendo and the localization or maybe you want to talk more about, I don't know, Minecraft or Gears of War 3 leaking.

2131
02:41:43,298 --> 02:41:44,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever it is you want to talk about, give us a call.

2132
02:41:44,579 --> 02:41:48,522
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2133
02:41:49,382 --> 02:41:52,165
[SPEAKER_10]: In the meantime, you know I'm going to ask Loki if there's any last minute stories.

2134
02:41:52,765 --> 02:42:00,151
[SPEAKER_11]: So apparently, because to celebrate Independence Day, you can now dress up your avatar on Xbox 360 as a Confederate soldier.

2135
02:42:02,233 --> 02:42:02,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

2136
02:42:03,073 --> 02:42:03,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh boy.

2137
02:42:03,734 --> 02:42:04,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Go south.

2138
02:42:06,496 --> 02:42:08,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, that's kind of weird.

2139
02:42:09,939 --> 02:42:12,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Not at all a bad thing.

2140
02:42:12,541 --> 02:42:12,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2141
02:42:14,352 --> 02:42:20,615
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you mean that they... Oh, but okay, it's just like you do the right combination of hats and gear.

2142
02:42:20,635 --> 02:42:23,817
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they have Civil War uniform, 160 Microsoft points.

2143
02:42:24,137 --> 02:42:24,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

2144
02:42:25,558 --> 02:42:26,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

2145
02:42:26,058 --> 02:42:29,380
[SPEAKER_11]: But you could do also the other stuff.

2146
02:42:29,440 --> 02:42:31,701
[SPEAKER_11]: They have also some funny hats.

2147
02:42:33,182 --> 02:42:34,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Because everyone loves funny hats.

2148
02:42:36,043 --> 02:42:36,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I love funny hats.

2149
02:42:38,416 --> 02:42:51,645
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd just be weird though, like, since a lot of that DLC doesn't translate over though into games, it would still be funny like playing, you know, seeing it or something like that with a civil, you know, a confederate soldier or something.

2150
02:42:51,706 --> 02:42:53,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else in last minute news tonight?

2151
02:42:57,910 --> 02:42:59,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Earth Defense Force is awesome.

2152
02:42:59,864 --> 02:43:01,805
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually watched you playing that a little bit over there.

2153
02:43:01,905 --> 02:43:03,365
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really hard.

2154
02:43:03,425 --> 02:43:05,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, and I'm only playing it easy.

2155
02:43:05,866 --> 02:43:09,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, if you play the harder difficulties, you can turn your AI bots off.

2156
02:43:11,248 --> 02:43:12,128
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even want to know.

2157
02:43:12,448 --> 02:43:19,070
[SPEAKER_11]: And then once you beat the game, they also have a campaign remix where you can play with different enemies spawning.

2158
02:43:19,790 --> 02:43:22,111
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's got a lot of gameplay built in there.

2159
02:43:22,151 --> 02:43:26,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry if I'm just ranting about this game, but it's worth picking up.

2160
02:43:27,193 --> 02:43:28,233
[SPEAKER_10]: You are a little bit, but it's fine.

2161
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:30,640
[SPEAKER_10]: We all knew this would happen.

2162
02:43:30,660 --> 02:43:32,421
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been talking about this game for like a year.

2163
02:43:33,441 --> 02:43:35,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Just you wait until Saints Row 3 comes out.

2164
02:43:35,262 --> 02:43:37,023
[SPEAKER_11]: You think this is bad.

2165
02:43:37,043 --> 02:43:43,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually kind of want to be there when you're playing Saints Row 3 for the first time.

2166
02:43:43,585 --> 02:43:47,206
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how I can do that, but we need to have a Saints Row 3 party.

2167
02:43:47,246 --> 02:43:48,226
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be fucking nuts.

2168
02:43:48,666 --> 02:43:50,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so here's something we can talk about.

2169
02:43:50,287 --> 02:43:53,068
[SPEAKER_10]: We can stream it on the internet, except, oh shit, we would be breaking the law.

2170
02:43:53,708 --> 02:43:56,889
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR His name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio if you want to give us a call.

2171
02:43:56,929 --> 02:43:58,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Bunchy Aerospace was finally announced.

2172
02:43:58,690 --> 02:44:16,296
[SPEAKER_11]: What that is, it's a partnership program with social and mobile devs where they're basically going to help either publish, promote, or draw interest for different games that are coming out on these platforms where they may not get as much interest.

2173
02:44:16,936 --> 02:44:18,157
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of cool.

2174
02:44:18,357 --> 02:44:23,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, they will not be building spaceships as not part of the aerospace program.

2175
02:44:24,019 --> 02:44:24,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the phones.

2176
02:44:24,760 --> 02:44:25,280
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a call.

2177
02:44:25,300 --> 02:44:27,801
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR after this is done.

2178
02:44:27,841 --> 02:44:28,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2179
02:44:28,602 --> 02:44:28,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2180
02:44:29,622 --> 02:44:29,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Pleasure.

2181
02:44:29,842 --> 02:44:30,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Zaku here.

2182
02:44:30,442 --> 02:44:30,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Zaku.

2183
02:44:30,943 --> 02:44:31,243
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

2184
02:44:32,563 --> 02:44:33,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much.

2185
02:44:33,104 --> 02:44:35,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to recover before tomorrow and everything.

2186
02:44:36,405 --> 02:44:40,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, tomorrow's when the real parties are supposed to happen.

2187
02:44:40,127 --> 02:44:42,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomorrow is when the real parties are supposed to happen.

2188
02:44:43,405 --> 02:44:45,947
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, just like a barbecue at my place at home.

2189
02:44:46,347 --> 02:44:46,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

2190
02:44:46,987 --> 02:44:49,348
[SPEAKER_01]: That and trying to go out with this girl tomorrow.

2191
02:44:50,229 --> 02:44:51,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I hope he gets some.

2192
02:44:51,049 --> 02:44:52,951
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind tonight?

2193
02:44:53,011 --> 02:45:08,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much, just like trying to lament over the fallout of what transpired last week with the whole Supreme Court decision, which I know you probably covered in great detail before this call.

2194
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:10,681
[SPEAKER_10]: We did, but what are your thoughts?

2195
02:45:11,829 --> 02:45:21,617
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, on one hand, it's like they're grasping at straws and trying to legislate something that's already been declared protected speech for all intents and purposes.

2196
02:45:21,737 --> 02:45:35,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like the people who were the ones who pushed the particular person that pushed the law and actually introduced the law and got it passed,

2197
02:45:36,129 --> 02:45:37,090
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2198
02:45:56,061 --> 02:46:03,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but what about how there were a couple justices that basically said, you can regulate games just not like this.

2199
02:46:04,065 --> 02:46:06,706
[SPEAKER_01]: That's leaving the door wide open for somebody else.

2200
02:46:06,766 --> 02:46:07,226
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

2201
02:46:07,806 --> 02:46:16,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Some have said it's a 5-4 split in reality because two of them concurred with the... Yeah, two of the other justices concurred with Scalia.

2202
02:46:17,130 --> 02:46:17,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

2203
02:46:17,650 --> 02:46:23,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's basically... It's like they weren't for it, but at the same time, they were in between.

2204
02:46:23,873 --> 02:46:24,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

2205
02:46:25,422 --> 02:46:39,451
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like a, you know, if you really get, if you really go deep into that decision, there's not that much, there's only like a, you know, a thin, you know, thin margin of just prevailing opinion.

2206
02:46:39,531 --> 02:46:40,151
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about this?

2207
02:46:40,171 --> 02:46:43,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's just like, that it barely got through.

2208
02:46:44,213 --> 02:46:47,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me quickly ask you, what do you think about this other bill we spent some time talking about tonight?

2209
02:46:47,435 --> 02:46:51,118
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole, you know, no more streaming of movies and games and so forth.

2210
02:46:52,318 --> 02:46:52,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that one is...

2211
02:46:54,383 --> 02:46:56,387
[SPEAKER_01]: That one right there, that's a landmine.

2212
02:46:57,028 --> 02:47:03,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure if it ever comes to court, one way or another we'll know what impact it has.

2213
02:47:03,940 --> 02:47:05,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's very murky.

2214
02:47:06,590 --> 02:47:11,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just waiting, and they're just waiting, you know, the feds are just waiting to at least use it on something.

2215
02:47:12,012 --> 02:47:12,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait for the 12-year-old.

2216
02:47:12,933 --> 02:47:19,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guy just, like, leaking a trailer on YouTube or just posting up a gameplay footage.

2217
02:47:19,936 --> 02:47:29,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason, you know, some video game company, which doesn't, you know, which took offense to that whole act, will sick the feds on them.

2218
02:47:29,420 --> 02:47:29,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it.

2219
02:47:30,060 --> 02:47:30,900
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait for the

2220
02:47:52,253 --> 02:47:55,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand, but guess who owns and still has control of the music?

2221
02:47:55,518 --> 02:48:07,135
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I get it, but I mean, if I... The label, remember, Lady Gaga's only one person that, until she's met the, until she's already honored the contract with her label, she doesn't own her music.

2222
02:48:07,896 --> 02:48:09,617
[SPEAKER_10]: She's a slave, just like Prince was.

2223
02:48:10,058 --> 02:48:10,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

2224
02:48:11,399 --> 02:48:11,999
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.

2225
02:48:12,059 --> 02:48:18,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you own your master tracks and you can take them anywhere else, then you have control of it.

2226
02:48:18,724 --> 02:48:25,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you've already sold your soul to the label, and they'll be the ones taking the feds on that 10-year-old kid.

2227
02:48:25,528 --> 02:48:27,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, any other quick thoughts before we let you go and get another call?

2228
02:48:28,686 --> 02:48:34,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, take advantage of these sales right now on these sites, Amazon, Steam in particular.

2229
02:48:36,070 --> 02:48:38,631
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of really good stuff to be had right now.

2230
02:48:38,691 --> 02:48:41,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Great FYI in chat from William Murderface.

2231
02:48:41,572 --> 02:48:42,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Always love that name.

2232
02:48:42,873 --> 02:48:48,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, if anyone's looking for a Diablo 2 fix and does not have Torchlight, it's on sale for $2.99 on Steam today.

2233
02:48:48,656 --> 02:48:49,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a $3 game.

2234
02:48:49,456 --> 02:48:50,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about it right now.

2235
02:48:50,657 --> 02:48:51,197
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like...

2236
02:48:51,497 --> 02:48:57,242
[SPEAKER_10]: If you even remotely like Diablo or Diablo 2, you will get $3 worth out of Torchlight.

2237
02:48:57,262 --> 02:48:59,323
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've played that game, you know, years ago.

2238
02:48:59,523 --> 02:49:02,025
[SPEAKER_01]: All I remember is just, like, mashing my mouse.

2239
02:49:02,546 --> 02:49:04,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Just click mashing.

2240
02:49:04,487 --> 02:49:07,250
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very much a dungeon... Well, here's the great thing.

2241
02:49:07,350 --> 02:49:07,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have a 360?

2242
02:49:09,752 --> 02:49:11,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but I... Go download the demo.

2243
02:49:12,254 --> 02:49:14,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just do it for my... I want to keep it old school.

2244
02:49:15,076 --> 02:49:15,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Ugh.

2245
02:49:15,919 --> 02:49:17,542
[SPEAKER_10]: We can at least download the demo to see what the game's like.

2246
02:49:17,582 --> 02:49:19,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I gotta let you go to get more calls.

2247
02:49:19,145 --> 02:49:19,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

2248
02:49:20,969 --> 02:49:21,930
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Torchlight's a great deal.

2249
02:49:21,970 --> 02:49:23,113
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it's a dungeon crawler.

2250
02:49:23,774 --> 02:49:28,443
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know, if you aren't into the dungeon crawlers, you may not like it, but we'll see.

2251
02:49:29,045 --> 02:49:30,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2252
02:49:30,266 --> 02:49:30,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2253
02:49:31,247 --> 02:49:32,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's Ranma.

2254
02:49:32,028 --> 02:49:32,768
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, everyone?

2255
02:49:32,949 --> 02:49:33,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

2256
02:49:33,669 --> 02:49:35,211
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, just hanging.

2257
02:49:36,111 --> 02:49:36,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Chillin'.

2258
02:49:37,012 --> 02:49:38,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Smoking a little, you know.

2259
02:49:39,535 --> 02:49:41,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Smoking a J. I'm allergic.

2260
02:49:41,977 --> 02:49:42,517
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't do that.

2261
02:49:43,018 --> 02:49:44,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, pass it over this way, man.

2262
02:49:44,219 --> 02:49:44,919
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the fourth.

2263
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:46,161
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

2264
02:49:46,681 --> 02:49:55,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I can think of no better way on Spending Independence Day than burning various things, including fireworks, our money, and a J.

2265
02:49:57,404 --> 02:49:59,546
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to complain, so it works for me.

2266
02:50:00,808 --> 02:50:02,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Only in America will we celebrate fire.

2267
02:50:02,550 --> 02:50:03,071
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

2268
02:50:04,432 --> 02:50:05,994
[SPEAKER_12]: I have just one question.

2269
02:50:06,014 --> 02:50:09,238
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been meaning to ask you guys this for as long as I keep forgetting.

2270
02:50:09,258 --> 02:50:10,099
[SPEAKER_10]: The answer is no.

2271
02:50:11,121 --> 02:50:12,382
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn it, Rob.

2272
02:50:13,083 --> 02:50:13,864
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the question?

2273
02:50:13,904 --> 02:50:14,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

2274
02:50:14,881 --> 02:50:16,002
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2275
02:50:33,395 --> 02:50:34,737
[SPEAKER_12]: turn their back on the fans.

2276
02:50:34,917 --> 02:50:36,920
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just looking for a quick pop.

2277
02:50:37,420 --> 02:50:45,711
[SPEAKER_12]: The other half are saying Konami is doing this to garner interest into the series to see if it's worth another game.

2278
02:50:45,991 --> 02:50:46,532
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think?

2279
02:50:48,694 --> 02:50:50,935
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a little bit of both, to be honest.

2280
02:50:51,035 --> 02:50:58,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's, you know, why not make a little more cash on games that were previously out, although they are having to redo them and so forth.

2281
02:50:58,497 --> 02:51:00,558
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they're having to change it up a little bit.

2282
02:51:01,478 --> 02:51:04,639
[SPEAKER_10]: But if the game sold phenomenally.

2283
02:51:05,459 --> 02:51:06,060
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2284
02:51:23,043 --> 02:51:51,322
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the games will sell alright and as far as Konami's motivation I mean, it's hard to say because the whole repackaging thing you can't say that Konami's the first to do it so I think they're just jumping on a bandwagon that people have shown they want to be on God of War has already done it the Ico games Shadow of the Colossus all that stuff's being redone so the gaming populace has already shown they'll buy it so you can't really blame Konami for putting it out there

2285
02:51:51,542 --> 02:51:59,605
[SPEAKER_11]: and even stuff that's come out recently like the Prince of Persia trilogy, the Splinter Cell trilogy is coming out a little bit later and Tomb Raider.

2286
02:52:00,225 --> 02:52:01,846
[SPEAKER_11]: They already did all those as well.

2287
02:52:03,647 --> 02:52:05,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I understand that.

2288
02:52:05,187 --> 02:52:19,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, do you think maybe time could be also a factor in this compared to like if the games came out within a certain range and maybe a couple years later they put out the collection compared to maybe waiting like five, six years later for a complete collection?

2289
02:52:21,158 --> 02:52:22,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure I follow you.

2290
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:23,922
[SPEAKER_10]: These collections are coming out next year.

2291
02:52:23,942 --> 02:52:26,085
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd say they put out Zone of the Enders 1, 2, and 3, let's say in 2000, 2001, 2002.

2292
02:52:26,166 --> 02:52:29,711
[SPEAKER_12]: And in 2005, they put out the collectors of all three together.

2293
02:52:37,592 --> 02:52:42,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Now let's say instead of 2005, they wait until about now to put them all out.

2294
02:52:42,355 --> 02:52:43,776
[SPEAKER_12]: They wait almost 10 years.

2295
02:52:44,096 --> 02:52:47,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but they're going to up-res them and make them more current.

2296
02:52:48,219 --> 02:52:50,561
[SPEAKER_10]: They're redoing them in HD, so I'm okay with it.

2297
02:52:51,361 --> 02:52:52,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's also be honest.

2298
02:52:52,342 --> 02:52:53,803
[SPEAKER_10]: How is this any different from the movie industry?

2299
02:52:55,224 --> 02:52:58,747
[SPEAKER_10]: The movie industry does this shit all the time, and we eat it up.

2300
02:52:59,287 --> 02:53:01,049
[SPEAKER_10]: How many times have the Star Wars movies come out?

2301
02:53:01,429 --> 02:53:06,694
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're coming out again on Blu-ray, and I know tons of people that'll be there right when they come out.

2302
02:53:06,714 --> 02:53:07,875
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't mean to interrupt, Rob.

2303
02:53:07,895 --> 02:53:11,819
[SPEAKER_12]: That's because George Lucas turned his back on the fans, and he's a money-grubbing whore.

2304
02:53:12,739 --> 02:53:14,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that, but the new Star Tours is really awesome.

2305
02:53:15,682 --> 02:53:19,345
[SPEAKER_10]: But what about Harry Potter?

2306
02:53:20,532 --> 02:53:24,613
[SPEAKER_10]: When those movies come out, they come out on Blu-ray and then you can get a box set with 1 through 5.

2307
02:53:25,393 --> 02:53:26,973
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when 6 came out, you could buy 6.

2308
02:53:27,093 --> 02:53:30,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and then now it's a box set with 1 through 6 and maybe some other bonus features.

2309
02:53:30,814 --> 02:53:31,454
[SPEAKER_10]: A preview of 7.

2310
02:53:32,254 --> 02:53:32,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, now 7's out.

2311
02:53:33,215 --> 02:53:35,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Now there's a box set of 1 through 7 and there'll be a preview for 8.

2312
02:53:36,675 --> 02:53:43,557
[SPEAKER_10]: And there'll be another box set when 8 comes out and it'll have the special features online, Uber, God, Poopy Pop.

2313
02:53:43,597 --> 02:53:43,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob?

2314
02:53:44,037 --> 02:53:44,237
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2315
02:53:45,257 --> 02:53:46,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Book 7 was the last one.

2316
02:53:47,197 --> 02:53:48,178
[SPEAKER_10]: But there was 8 movies.

2317
02:53:48,718 --> 02:53:49,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about the movies.

2318
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:52,941
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, book seven was two movies, but I see your point.

2319
02:53:53,021 --> 02:53:55,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just trying to be an ass.

2320
02:53:55,101 --> 02:53:55,821
[SPEAKER_12]: You're trying to be an ass.

2321
02:53:55,841 --> 02:53:57,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, wait, wait, now hold on a second.

2322
02:53:57,602 --> 02:54:01,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Is not, is not this new movie the eighth movie coming out?

2323
02:54:02,423 --> 02:54:06,844
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand it's two parts, but it is, in the line of movies, the eighth movie.

2324
02:54:06,884 --> 02:54:09,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yes, it is the eighth movie.

2325
02:54:09,645 --> 02:54:09,925
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.

2326
02:54:09,985 --> 02:54:14,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Watch Warner Brothers release both movies together as movie seven.

2327
02:54:14,246 --> 02:54:15,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to fuck with you.

2328
02:54:16,980 --> 02:54:18,021
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like Twilight.

2329
02:54:18,401 --> 02:54:20,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't they splitting the last one into two so there's five movies?

2330
02:54:20,803 --> 02:54:23,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, as if it hasn't drug out long enough already.

2331
02:54:23,946 --> 02:54:25,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's put the last one in the two.

2332
02:54:26,929 --> 02:54:27,129
Ugh.

2333
02:54:27,689 --> 02:54:28,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Boring.

2334
02:54:28,830 --> 02:54:32,533
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Morpheus in our chatroom says, actually, Lord of the Rings is the biggest DVD whore.

2335
02:54:33,074 --> 02:54:33,915
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, yeah.

2336
02:54:34,335 --> 02:54:39,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Now Blu-ray whore because the super extended editions, yes, as if that movie wasn't long enough.

2337
02:54:39,399 --> 02:54:43,523
[SPEAKER_07]: And theatrical re-release bullshit, which I don't give a shit about and I won't go see.

2338
02:54:44,232 --> 02:54:45,494
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't mind going to see it.

2339
02:54:45,915 --> 02:54:46,275
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

2340
02:54:46,796 --> 02:54:47,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I should admit this.

2341
02:54:49,139 --> 02:54:50,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I never saw the third movie.

2342
02:54:51,776 --> 02:54:52,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw it.

2343
02:54:52,176 --> 02:54:54,757
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw the first two opening day, nonetheless.

2344
02:54:54,857 --> 02:54:55,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I never saw the third movie.

2345
02:54:55,578 --> 02:54:58,559
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, for me, and people are going to go, oh, you're a hater.

2346
02:54:59,339 --> 02:55:02,061
[SPEAKER_07]: But the whole point is that I read the books.

2347
02:55:03,121 --> 02:55:05,082
[SPEAKER_07]: The movies were good.

2348
02:55:06,463 --> 02:55:10,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm more interested in The Hobbit coming out because I like The Hobbit better than I liked the other books.

2349
02:55:10,945 --> 02:55:12,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe you read those books.

2350
02:55:12,305 --> 02:55:13,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I've tried to read those books.

2351
02:55:13,386 --> 02:55:13,766
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't.

2352
02:55:13,866 --> 02:55:16,327
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, speak a language I can read.

2353
02:55:16,427 --> 02:55:18,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Tolkien was so fucking boring.

2354
02:55:19,640 --> 02:55:24,284
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good story, but my god, we don't need that much description of the grass.

2355
02:55:24,564 --> 02:55:26,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.

2356
02:55:27,206 --> 02:55:31,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob, before I go, I just want to say, in response to Twilight, I love that picture you posted on your Tumblr.

2357
02:55:32,830 --> 02:55:40,276
[SPEAKER_10]: The one of the stakes on the fence that says, in case of sparkly vampires, or break off in case of sparkly vampires, right?

2358
02:55:40,356 --> 02:55:43,318
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think I posted it and I put, how about screaming fangirls, too?

2359
02:55:43,888 --> 02:55:48,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and before I go, I'm going to say I dedicate this picture to you that I put on my blog post.

2360
02:55:48,652 --> 02:55:50,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I just posted it in the chat room.

2361
02:55:50,253 --> 02:55:50,533
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2362
02:55:51,073 --> 02:55:51,474
[SPEAKER_10]: You got it.

2363
02:55:51,994 --> 02:55:52,234
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2364
02:55:52,594 --> 02:55:52,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

2365
02:55:58,899 --> 02:55:59,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry for the awkward silence there.

2366
02:55:59,980 --> 02:56:04,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I was typing an important message because there's a YouTube I want to find real quick there, so I'm trying to find it there.

2367
02:56:04,683 --> 02:56:06,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me look at what Ranma posted to his Tumblr.

2368
02:56:06,485 --> 02:56:07,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on one sec.

2369
02:56:07,225 --> 02:56:07,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2370
02:56:09,254 --> 02:56:11,157
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm following the link and let's see.

2371
02:56:14,002 --> 02:56:14,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that.

2372
02:56:15,044 --> 02:56:17,869
[SPEAKER_10]: It's haters gonna hate but it's Frank and Furter from the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

2373
02:56:17,889 --> 02:56:18,691
[SPEAKER_10]: You see this, DarkSakura?

2374
02:56:19,767 --> 02:56:20,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's awesome.

2375
02:56:20,808 --> 02:56:23,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you need to put that on Tumblr so I can reblog it.

2376
02:56:23,069 --> 02:56:23,969
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on Ranma's Tumblr.

2377
02:56:24,249 --> 02:56:24,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then I'll reblog it.

2378
02:56:24,769 --> 02:56:25,330
[SPEAKER_10]: If you follow him.

2379
02:56:26,090 --> 02:56:27,591
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up with... Now it's Tumblr.

2380
02:56:28,811 --> 02:56:33,574
[SPEAKER_10]: There was LiveJournal, which I'm a permanent member of, so I always have to love LiveJournal forever and ever.

2381
02:56:34,054 --> 02:56:35,234
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Facebook.

2382
02:56:35,715 --> 02:56:37,896
[SPEAKER_10]: There's MySpace back in the day.

2383
02:56:38,356 --> 02:56:39,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Friendster, shit.

2384
02:56:39,777 --> 02:56:40,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.

2385
02:56:40,617 --> 02:56:41,297
[SPEAKER_10]: And now there's fucking Tumblr.

2386
02:56:41,317 --> 02:56:42,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I never used Friendster.

2387
02:56:42,558 --> 02:56:43,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I never used it.

2388
02:56:43,218 --> 02:56:43,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

2389
02:56:43,938 --> 02:56:44,819
[SPEAKER_10]: How did you avoid that?

2390
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:48,581
[SPEAKER_07]: It was... I love my LiveJournal so much.

2391
02:56:48,921 --> 02:56:49,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

2392
02:56:52,461 --> 02:56:56,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's Blender.

2393
02:56:56,603 --> 02:56:57,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.

2394
02:56:59,085 --> 02:57:06,949
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I kind of wanted to go back to this whole class action lawsuit that you guys were talking about with these online games.

2395
02:57:07,049 --> 02:57:07,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2396
02:57:08,049 --> 02:57:16,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I think eventually somebody's going to find a loophole and actually get in on this.

2397
02:57:18,103 --> 02:57:21,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a couple of you guys are into Disney and all that.

2398
02:57:21,605 --> 02:57:24,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember the Virtual Magic Kingdom game?

2399
02:57:25,128 --> 02:57:26,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you ever heard of it.

2400
02:57:26,809 --> 02:57:29,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember the NES game Adventures in the Magic.

2401
02:57:29,832 --> 02:57:30,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait, no, no, no.

2402
02:57:30,652 --> 02:57:31,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Online.

2403
02:57:31,173 --> 02:57:33,374
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it was the online MMO.

2404
02:57:33,495 --> 02:57:34,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I ever played it.

2405
02:57:34,375 --> 02:57:36,097
[SPEAKER_06]: That Disney put out for the 50-year anniversary.

2406
02:57:37,438 --> 02:57:40,060
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'm familiar with some of the Disney MMOs.

2407
02:57:40,220 --> 02:57:43,782
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Club Penguin, and I know that they're infamous for not letting you type.

2408
02:57:44,803 --> 02:57:45,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2409
02:57:45,184 --> 02:57:46,865
[SPEAKER_10]: You can only select from select phrases.

2410
02:57:47,836 --> 02:57:48,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, no, no.

2411
02:57:48,957 --> 02:57:59,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what they did is for the 50-year anniversary, they created an MMO, which was a free walk through Disneyland Park, and you can create friends and meet people.

2412
02:58:00,427 --> 02:58:03,229
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really messed up some people when they closed that site down.

2413
02:58:03,410 --> 02:58:04,791
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I got a link.

2414
02:58:05,771 --> 02:58:10,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's going to post, but... Rob, Peter was telling us about that when we were at the park.

2415
02:58:10,953 --> 02:58:14,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... I just... Because I have a pin from it.

2416
02:58:14,975 --> 02:58:15,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right.

2417
02:58:16,015 --> 02:58:16,875
[SPEAKER_10]: That I do remember.

2418
02:58:16,895 --> 02:58:17,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2419
02:58:17,276 --> 02:58:17,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2420
02:58:17,696 --> 02:58:18,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried it with a cast member.

2421
02:58:18,616 --> 02:58:20,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have one of the links that I just picked.

2422
02:58:20,797 --> 02:58:23,918
[SPEAKER_06]: It was from Joystick.com is when they closed the actual site.

2423
02:58:24,658 --> 02:58:29,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it was really devastating because I was actually on it for like two years.

2424
02:58:30,681 --> 02:58:30,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

2425
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,122
[SPEAKER_06]: It killed a lot of kids.

2426
02:58:36,322 --> 02:58:42,127
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like 10, 11-year-old kids, or even younger, that couldn't play this game anymore.

2427
02:58:42,768 --> 02:58:49,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really think that if somebody's going to find a loophole with closing down these large MMOs, that they're going to...

2428
02:58:51,397 --> 02:58:52,057
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2429
02:59:11,550 --> 02:59:15,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Here, open up your own damn servers, and if you want to copy your characters over, here's how you do it.

2430
02:59:16,274 --> 02:59:16,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, isn't that right?

2431
02:59:17,394 --> 02:59:26,961
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, you followed this better than I did, but Blue Burst, when they went under, Sega was very much like... Sega was like, here's your character data, and you can transfer it to the server of your choice.

2432
02:59:27,322 --> 02:59:27,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2433
02:59:28,342 --> 02:59:37,850
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you're in an interesting position with Star Wars Galaxies, because they probably just don't... They want those people playing the Bioware Star Wars game that's coming out.

2434
02:59:38,770 --> 02:59:38,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

2435
02:59:38,910 --> 02:59:39,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

2436
03:00:03,001 --> 03:00:30,690
[SPEAKER_10]: the closest thing you get are these expansions such as Cataclysm that changed Warcraft so drastically it's almost like a sequel so that's what you're the way you're talking about it is breaking it up instead of like for example Virtual Magic Kingdom where they closed it down totally they should have gone open source so somebody who loved it could have kept it going but how can you force a company to do that?

2437
03:00:32,102 --> 03:00:41,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and it's so funny because I had a bunch of friends on there, and we were on there for, oh, we'd go on there every day, you know.

2438
03:00:42,666 --> 03:00:51,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing was, the kids that were on this actual site weren't allowed to actually give out emails and communicate with each other.

2439
03:00:52,330 --> 03:00:55,691
[SPEAKER_06]: They were only allowed to talk on this virtual Magic Kingdom.

2440
03:00:56,809 --> 03:01:00,091
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you weren't allowed to give any personal information away.

2441
03:01:00,271 --> 03:01:02,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right, because you were very restrictive of what you could say.

2442
03:01:02,432 --> 03:01:06,434
[SPEAKER_06]: All of a sudden they said in a month from now we're closing the site and it's done.

2443
03:01:06,654 --> 03:01:07,074
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

2444
03:01:08,235 --> 03:01:08,835
[SPEAKER_10]: And people don't...

2445
03:01:09,963 --> 03:01:13,384
[SPEAKER_06]: God, it just kills a bunch of these little kids, you know?

2446
03:01:13,684 --> 03:01:18,945
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sad, but at the same time, how can you force a company to keep something going that's not making them any money?

2447
03:01:19,405 --> 03:01:23,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, if the miniature golf place closes down, what can you do about it?

2448
03:01:24,486 --> 03:01:24,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2449
03:01:25,346 --> 03:01:30,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone's actually made a, quote, replacement called Virtual Family Kingdom.

2450
03:01:31,767 --> 03:01:33,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, yeah, I've seen that one.

2451
03:01:33,788 --> 03:01:36,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, everybody jumped over to that.

2452
03:01:36,448 --> 03:01:39,169
[SPEAKER_06]: That was sponsored by the Smithsonian Kingdom.

2453
03:01:39,958 --> 03:01:42,299
[SPEAKER_06]: or Smithsonian Institute.

2454
03:01:42,719 --> 03:01:46,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was just horrible when they went over to that.

2455
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:52,502
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know if you guys saw the post that I put.

2456
03:01:52,802 --> 03:01:54,403
[SPEAKER_06]: You should see some of the stories.

2457
03:01:54,443 --> 03:02:00,004
[SPEAKER_06]: There were actually people protesting in front of Disneyland the day that it closed down.

2458
03:02:00,044 --> 03:02:00,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2459
03:02:00,484 --> 03:02:00,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2460
03:02:03,730 --> 03:02:06,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe they'll be protesting on Star Wars.

2461
03:02:20,976 --> 03:02:23,037
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm going to be able to get some money out of it.

2462
03:02:23,357 --> 03:02:23,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2463
03:02:24,178 --> 03:02:28,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I still think the terms of service are going to ultimately let the companies come out ahead.

2464
03:02:28,981 --> 03:02:29,381
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll see.

2465
03:02:29,741 --> 03:02:30,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll see.

2466
03:02:30,502 --> 03:02:32,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to let you go, buddy, before we wrap up the show.

2467
03:02:32,243 --> 03:02:32,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your call.

2468
03:02:33,183 --> 03:02:33,683
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

2469
03:02:34,484 --> 03:02:35,064
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a good topic.

2470
03:02:35,264 --> 03:02:35,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.

2471
03:02:36,465 --> 03:02:37,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Blender, live on OLR.

2472
03:02:54,372 --> 03:03:06,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know you guys, I got sent this YouTube and this is a YouTube of DJ Ranma S actually watching the Breaking Dawn trailer and let's see how Ranma actually reacted to seeing this trailer the first time.

2473
03:03:08,562 --> 03:03:09,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking massive boobs.

2474
03:03:26,465 --> 03:03:28,107
[SPEAKER_10]: God, Ranma, you're getting really upset over this.

2475
03:03:33,633 --> 03:03:34,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get naked.

2476
03:03:36,035 --> 03:03:37,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get naked, Ranma.

2477
03:03:37,417 --> 03:03:40,080
[SPEAKER_10]: You were the one talking about vagina in the chat room earlier.

2478
03:03:40,721 --> 03:03:40,821
No.

2479
03:03:45,785 --> 03:03:46,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Breaking Dawn Trailer Badly Written

2480
03:04:13,689 --> 03:04:17,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried to read a page of that and I was like, who let this woman write?

2481
03:04:19,872 --> 03:04:29,337
[SPEAKER_10]: There should be a class action lawsuit against Bic for selling that woman a pen.

2482
03:04:29,357 --> 03:04:30,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I blame her for being Mormon.

2483
03:04:33,939 --> 03:04:35,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I love DJ Morpheus in chat.

2484
03:04:35,860 --> 03:04:37,061
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just cold, Rob.

2485
03:04:37,301 --> 03:04:39,682
[SPEAKER_10]: That's coming from Travis, of all people.

2486
03:04:41,603 --> 03:04:42,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, that's just cold.

2487
03:04:43,686 --> 03:04:46,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, that's going to do it for another week of Orange on Trail.

2488
03:04:47,008 --> 03:04:48,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have any other last minute news?

2489
03:04:50,291 --> 03:04:51,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Just real quick stuff.

2490
03:04:51,291 --> 03:04:51,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm alive.

2491
03:04:51,872 --> 03:04:54,093
[SPEAKER_11]: It's supposed to be coming out still.

2492
03:04:55,995 --> 03:05:00,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Classifications are found on the Australian website and Crisis is supposed to be coming to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

2493
03:05:02,278 --> 03:05:03,178
[SPEAKER_11]: because this is on the ESRB.

2494
03:05:04,439 --> 03:05:04,719
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2495
03:05:05,219 --> 03:05:07,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

2496
03:05:07,560 --> 03:05:13,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we get the final thoughts, I want to thank you once again for listening to Orange Launch Radio and supporting us over these nine years of our program.

2497
03:05:13,583 --> 03:05:15,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, we're here to do it every Sunday night.

2498
03:05:15,183 --> 03:05:17,864
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you've never come out for a live show, it's a bummer.

2499
03:05:17,924 --> 03:05:20,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight would have been a great night because many folks out there don't work on Monday.

2500
03:05:21,006 --> 03:05:25,187
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, if you have the time in the future, please do consider joining us for a live show.

2501
03:05:25,227 --> 03:05:27,488
[SPEAKER_10]: We do tape live at All Games Radio, allgames.com.

2502
03:05:27,908 --> 03:05:31,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Buffett Show.

2503
03:05:31,070 --> 03:05:32,010
[SPEAKER_07]: You always say specific.

2504
03:05:32,150 --> 03:05:32,570
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

2505
03:05:55,287 --> 03:05:58,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Choo is the sound that What's-Her-Name makes in Space Channel 5.

2506
03:05:58,850 --> 03:05:59,731
[SPEAKER_10]: La la.

2507
03:05:59,751 --> 03:06:00,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's Choo!

2508
03:06:01,472 --> 03:06:01,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh la la.

2509
03:06:02,052 --> 03:06:03,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh la la.

2510
03:06:03,353 --> 03:06:06,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Space Channel 5 Part 2 is on Steam for six bucks.

2511
03:06:06,996 --> 03:06:07,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, nice.

2512
03:06:07,577 --> 03:06:07,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2513
03:06:08,217 --> 03:06:09,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I already have like two copies of it.

2514
03:06:10,059 --> 03:06:10,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

2515
03:06:10,979 --> 03:06:11,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of good stuff to buy on Steam.

2516
03:06:12,020 --> 03:06:14,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you, BitTrip Runner, if it's still $2.50, is a great buy.

2517
03:06:16,147 --> 03:06:18,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lodge Radio.

2518
03:06:18,488 --> 03:06:19,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Please help spread the word.

2519
03:06:20,809 --> 03:06:24,250
[SPEAKER_10]: OrangeLodgeRadio.com, join our website, check the forums, all that good stuff.

2520
03:06:24,290 --> 03:06:25,891
[SPEAKER_10]: We really need to get the activity on the forums again.

2521
03:06:25,911 --> 03:06:28,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to really think about how we can get those going.

2522
03:06:28,852 --> 03:06:31,994
[SPEAKER_10]: But meanwhile, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for tonight.

2523
03:06:32,014 --> 03:06:32,874
[SPEAKER_10]: So Loki, we'll start with you.

2524
03:06:32,894 --> 03:06:33,734
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your final thought tonight?

2525
03:06:34,635 --> 03:06:38,276
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to work in some more Earth Defense Force this weekend.

2526
03:06:39,096 --> 03:06:40,597
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to play it for a few hours last night.

2527
03:06:40,997 --> 03:06:42,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I really need to play more of that.

2528
03:06:44,615 --> 03:06:46,398
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought of the night is, you know what?

2529
03:06:46,458 --> 03:06:48,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Vanille and Hope, they aren't that bad.

2530
03:06:48,761 --> 03:06:51,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Like 30 hours later, they aren't that bad.

2531
03:06:52,225 --> 03:06:53,306
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

2532
03:06:54,588 --> 03:06:55,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Lesbians.

2533
03:06:57,366 --> 03:06:57,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck yeah.

2534
03:06:59,388 --> 03:07:00,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I just looked at Alan's Twitter.

2535
03:07:01,091 --> 03:07:02,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Tumblr.

2536
03:07:02,793 --> 03:07:04,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, what's Alan tweeting about lesbians for?

2537
03:07:04,735 --> 03:07:05,576
[SPEAKER_10]: This is his picture.

2538
03:07:05,696 --> 03:07:08,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and don't buy, my other final thought, don't buy your games from eBay.

2539
03:07:09,821 --> 03:07:12,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless they're, well, I guess the used market's okay, but just be careful.

2540
03:07:13,205 --> 03:07:14,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy or beware on eBay.

2541
03:07:14,827 --> 03:07:16,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Just look at the feedback before you buy.

2542
03:07:17,370 --> 03:07:28,917
