00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,160
Tonight, July 3rd, 2011, online videos may soon make you a criminal, Nintendo spends

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,000
big bucks on a new facility, and an early build of an anticipated 360 game leaks to

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,560
the internet.

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,440
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,120
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,200
We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com as we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,040
Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,240
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts,

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,520
first off, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Mar.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
How are you?

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Mar mar mar.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
Mars?

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
Are you offering me a Mars bar?

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
No.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
I love British chocolate.

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,320
I was thinking, well you can get a Snickers Dark and it's the same thing.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,200
I was, it just popped into my head about Seaman.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,320
Mar mar mar.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,400
One of the things a little Seaman says.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,520
So you're thinking about Seaman at the top of the show.

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Man.

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
Okay, I see.

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,080
I also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Hi.

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
How are you, Loki?

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Good.

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
All right.

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, we're going to get into, of course, all the good stuff we like to do at the top

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
of the show.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
How was your gaming week and so forth.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,240
But I'm going to start off tonight's show with a bang and it's going to be in our chat

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,720
room, chat.orangelaunge, if I even knew our website, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,680
I'm going to give away one of my birthday presents right here, live on air, starting

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,280
off the show tonight because I love the listeners that much.

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,300
I'm going to share my birthday with you guys.

37
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,200
It's an Xbox 360 game, so I'm going to give it to one of you guys in chat.

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,080
So all I need you to do is whoever wants it in the chat room, say, I want Rob's 360 game.

39
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
You just type that out.

40
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,280
I want Rob's 360 game.

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,320
You only say it once.

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,960
If you say it more than once, you've disqualified yourself.

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,320
At the end, we'll pick a number one through whatever of how many of you said, I want Rob's

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
360 game.

45
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,960
And we are going to give it away right here at the top of the show this week.

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,840
I'll tell you more about what it is after our gaming week.

47
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,920
See, that's what we do is a little thing called a radio tease.

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
It's yours.

49
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
It's not yours.

50
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,320
I can say with a clean conscience is not yours.

51
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,800
It is something I received from my birthday on the 360 and I'm giving it away, but you

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
know what?

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
We're a sweeten the pot a little bit.

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,840
Not only are we going to give it away, I'm going to sign it.

55
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,320
So is Dark Soccer and Loki.

56
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,680
So it's going to be like a autographed sign it with my butt and Dark Soccer will sign

57
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
it with her butt.

58
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
No.

59
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
All right.

60
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Yep.

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Give it away.

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Give it away now.

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
All right.

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Moving on.

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Let's start off.

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
How was your gaming week?

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,720
I, um, played WoW.

68
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,400
I got 50 mounts today, so now I have an albino drake.

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:02,680
So it has a skin condition and, uh, that's about it.

70
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Next.

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Lol.

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,760
You're addicted to WoW.

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Your fault.

74
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
All right.

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,200
Uh, then Loki, how was your gaming week?

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,480
Have you been playing anything like that's not WoW?

77
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,400
Of course I haven't been playing WoW, because I don't get WoW and nor would I want to play

78
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
WoW.

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Um, no, I played more Grand Theft Auto this week, um, same old stuff.

80
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,040
And then of course Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon, because it's awesome.

81
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,400
I got that early this week and was able to play through quite a bit of it and, um, I'm

82
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,320
happy to say it exceeds my expectations in every possible way.

83
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,720
It is, it's just basically, you know, a very polished version of, like, Earth Defense Force

84
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:53,060
2017, um, done in the U.S. and, you know, they've taken a lot of stuff that people like

85
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,760
from other shooters and stuff kind of incorporated into the game.

86
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,380
Um, everything seems to be more action-packed, missions seem a little bit longer, and, um,

87
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,740
it's just, it's very fun.

88
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,280
And the multiplayer over the internet's actually pretty fun.

89
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,480
I've been playing a few games, uh, because I picked up a few copies of it, um, between

90
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,800
my coworkers and it was pretty cool.

91
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,400
Tried to play some games over the weekend, though, and was unable to connect to my other

92
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,120
coworker that has it, but, uh, yeah, I'm definitely digging this game and highly recommend you

93
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
pick it up.

94
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,280
I mean, it's, depending on where you go, it may be out yesterday or out on Tuesday, um,

95
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,520
there's an interesting story behind that, too.

96
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:41,920
But, yeah, so, it's, it's really fun, um, you know, graphics and sound are pretty good,

97
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,240
uh, I mean, especially when you're comparing them to Earth Defense Force, you know, the

98
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,080
first one, it's just night and day, um, I mean, there's a little bit of slowdown, some

99
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,960
of your AI are kind of dumb, but they're actually, uh, pretty smart this time around, they actually

100
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,520
do a lot of work and they don't die as, you know, quite often, because you have a three-man

101
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,240
team the entire time, whether it be with players or AI, and, uh, the different suits you can

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,840
try out, those are kind of cool, um, but overall, it's just a great, great game, and I really,

103
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,600
I love playing, in fact, I'll be playing some of it during the show, because that's what

104
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
I do.

105
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,880
Uh, be careful, though, you don't want to stream it anywhere to the internet, because

106
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,320
you might get arrested for that, but we'll get into that later in the show.

107
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,920
So, how does this game outshine the original?

108
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
How's it outshine the original?

109
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,680
Well, the original was really, really, really buggy, and just really cheap, but it was fun

110
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,160
because you're fighting a bunch of different things all at once.

111
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,640
This one kind of ramps up everything, the graphics are better, um, you know, the detail

112
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,560
in the game, like destroying buildings and stuff, it's not just, you know, kind of breaking

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,680
apart and falling, I mean, they still do that, but there's a lot more ways you can interact,

114
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,760
it breaks up the gameplay quite a bit, um, you know, you have the standard just running

115
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,280
around shooting stuff, and then you have, like, parts where you're in a, you know, drop

116
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,720
ship and you're manning, uh, you know, auto cannons off the side of that, or you're inside

117
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,120
of a turret, or you're in the mechs, which, by the way, the rideable vehicles that they

118
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,560
have in this game aren't terrible, like the first game, where they had just these mechs

119
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,920
that moved super fucking slow, and were weak, and you just, it was kind of pointless to

120
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,880
be inside of them, um, but this time, though, the mechs are actually pretty awesome, uh,

121
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,880
the tank is really cool, and the turrets are pretty fun to play around with, uh, sound

122
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,960
is actually really good in it, um, I thought, you know, it was just really action packed,

123
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,520
um, just all the missions, seeing the, like, oh, here, you're gonna be attacked by these

124
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,640
things, oh, and now here's this thing coming in, oh, and some drop ships just came in,

125
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,680
and they're gonna be, uh, making your life hell, it's just, it's really overwhelming,

126
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,240
and, uh, yet without being too difficult, and although I am playing on the normal mode

127
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,000
right now, because I'm starting everything off normal, then going through the hard, and

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,160
then the inferno, which is just insane, um, it is ramping up difficulty pretty fast, and,

129
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,960
uh, you know, that's the thing, in each mission, whereas the first game, the missions were

130
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,040
pretty short, and they had, like, 73 of them, this one, the missions have different, like,

131
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,720
waypoints, different, um, things going on, and as, uh, they have, kind of, the game broken

132
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,800
up in the chapters with different, uh, bits of the story going on, uh, like, right now,

133
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,880
this part, I'm retrieving a package with it, ended up being some sort of alien bomb, and

134
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,520
then I had to take out some sort of queen ant thing, and that's where I died last, but,

135
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,920
uh, it's just, it's very, very action packed.

136
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,560
Let's go to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, the ever present, present fourth guest here

137
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,800
on Orange Launch Radio, uh, sha100matt says, I played Earth Defense Force 2 at PAX East,

138
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,080
and it really just reminded me of the next gen version of the N64 game of Body Harvest.

139
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,760
I sadly didn't like it as much as Loki likes it.

140
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,000
Uh, Brakeman says, wait, what's going on here?

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,240
Loki actually likes a game?

142
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
So you don't...

143
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,900
I like games all the time.

144
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,960
This isn't really one that you hear about a lot, though, and clearly you're biased towards

145
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,920
this series, you really enjoyed the first one, you like this, you're not being paid

146
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,640
under the table by these folks, right?

147
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
No.

148
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,680
And you actually spilled the news on this a long time ago, didn't you?

149
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Yes.

150
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
I seem to recall.

151
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,040
Because I, I look for this, I'm like, whooo, whooo, whooo, whooo.

152
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
You're the only one who cares.

153
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Exactly.

154
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
I was like, this is kinda...

155
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,720
Why do you think you, you know, and, and that happens in gaming sometimes.

156
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,560
Sometimes we like a game that nobody else sees to like for unexplainable reasons.

157
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,080
Why are you so drawn to this freaking game?

158
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
It's just fun.

159
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,880
It's, it's kinda taking games back to where, what the focus should be in any game.

160
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,360
It's not about the great, great graphics or, you know, making sure everything's cinematic

161
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,520
and has a great story.

162
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,040
It's all about being fun.

163
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
And that's what this is.

164
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,360
This is basically like a popcorn action flick or something like that.

165
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,480
The story, yeah, there's somewhat of a story there, but who gives a shit?

166
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,800
It's just, you know, just there to move, move the game up.

167
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Yeah, exactly.

168
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,360
It's basically, you know, you're going crazy, there's all these, you know, different bugs

169
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,480
coming, and they even poke fun at everything, I mean, because they're like, they're all

170
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
yes.

171
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,880
This, because they call the aliens Ravagers, they're all, yes, this Ravager we've named

172
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,960
Daddy Longlegs because it looks like a Daddy Longlegs spider.

173
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,200
He's like, I know, it's our intelligence doesn't have a better name for it, but, you know,

174
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
that's what we're calling it.

175
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,880
And they have like a, there was a part where I got picked up by this one, this one dropship

176
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,260
in the pilot.

177
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:39,120
He's just being, doing all the like really typical, and yes, off to the left, you'll

178
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,520
see here, there's a giant swarm of enemy, you know, and it's attacking, and you'll notice

179
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,200
that our, that we'll be cruising at an altitude of, you know, it just like, the really-

180
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
That's kind of like Starship Troopers.

181
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,120
It is very much like Starship Troopers, just without all the, you know, propaganda in there.

182
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,080
I mean, it's very, I don't know, it's fun.

183
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,440
If you tried the first game and you thought, oh my god, this game is like a piece of shit

184
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,640
as far as, you know, and granted, the first game had no physics whatsoever.

185
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,080
I mean, you could fall from a helicopter in space and land on the ground and be just fine.

186
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,280
I mean, there is no anything.

187
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,280
And you know, the spaceships, when they crash, they just kind of slowly sink through the

188
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,640
ground and you could be in the path of one of them and it just clips right through you

189
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
and stuff.

190
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,200
Well, this one, I mean, the actual ships when they crash, I mean, they will take out buildings

191
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,240
and they will, they explode and they will possibly kill you if you're too close to it.

192
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,080
Or like the enemy kind of spaceships that are flying around, if you're shooting them

193
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,200
and they get damaged enough, they will actually try to kamikaze into you and try to destroy

194
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
you that way.

195
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,560
But it's just, it's ridiculous fun.

196
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
That's all it is.

197
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,880
It's a great game.

198
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,320
And really, I mean, when you look at it in the month of July, there's not a lot coming

199
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
out anyways.

200
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,960
If you're not a fan of football, then you're left with Harry Potter and Call of Juarez,

201
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
you know, the cartel.

202
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,200
What you hear is kind of terrible.

203
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,320
Tigerclaw in our chat room says, at least it's not Grand Theft Auto IV, which is all

204
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
he ever plays.

205
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
You know what?

206
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
True that.

207
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,480
I'm excited to hear Loki give an in-depth review to something else on the show for once.

208
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,160
All right.

209
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,760
So Dan just walked in without a mic interrupting the show saying that Shadows of the Damned

210
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
is fucking hilarious.

211
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
It is a fun game.

212
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,860
I've, I've heard this is kind of a, I haven't played it at all, but I've heard it's kind

213
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,000
of fun too.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,440
It's amazing.

215
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,300
It's a road trip movie, a road trip movie game in hell, basically.

216
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:40,420
It's like very Grindhouse-ish, but it's just, I don't know, insane.

217
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,120
This is why people want to ban these games.

218
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
All right.

219
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,980
Uh, let's move on to my gaming week.

220
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,920
First off, before I get to the contest, which I know you're all eagerly awaiting to see

221
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,680
who won the contest, let me tell you about my gaming week because I did play some new

222
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,920
games this week.

223
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,040
First game I'm going to tell you about.

224
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,800
On a whim, I was at Fry's the other day because I had to buy a new headset for my computer

225
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,400
because my fat ass sat down on my old ones.

226
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,240
Don't ask how I do that, but uh, yeah, I bought a new headset, but I saw on the shelf for

227
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,120
40 bucks, I saw a copy of Dance Dance Revolution on the Xbox 360, which is the brand new one.

228
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,160
This is the reboot, quote unquote, of DDR.

229
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,200
They had the brand new game and dance pad for 40 bucks and I was like, well, you know,

230
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,320
how bad could this possibly be?

231
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
I like DDR.

232
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,600
I, you know, obviously, OLR was built on DDR and all that, so why not?

233
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm going to buy this game.

234
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,920
And I took it home and played it for a little while and I was sad because it is horrible.

235
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,480
It is a step backward for the genre.

236
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,840
It is just a terrible, terrible version of DDR.

237
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,320
It is, and big parts of that I can really blame on the song list.

238
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,660
Um, you know, I was excited when I read the back of the box and saw that Lady Gaga was

239
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,680
in it and yes, there is a Gaga song in it and that's pretty cool.

240
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,600
Then there's some of the Japanese DDR songs that you've come to expect, except I would

241
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,240
say 75 percent of them were Naoki or one of his other incarnations, which, you know, back

242
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,720
when Max, Max 2, Extreme, all of that was out, it wasn't so dominated by Naoki.

243
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,520
I mean, granted, he's always been a huge presence in DDR, but not this bad.

244
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,700
But then you look at some of the other licensed songs they pick.

245
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,280
I kid you not.

246
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,120
There's a Leona Lewis song in there because when I think dance, I think a slow jam by

247
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,320
Leona Lewis.

248
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,000
There was a train song in there, I think Drops of Jupiter or something, I don't know.

249
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
I can't even remember the names of their songs.

250
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,320
They all sound the same to me, the guy whines like he has a vagine.

251
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,000
And then the song that just made me want to crinkle up my dance pad and throw it out the

252
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,880
window, Need You Now by Lady Antebellum.

253
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:48,920
That's right, that slow jam song, country, western music somehow is appropriate for DDR.

254
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,380
And I was just like, I died inside.

255
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,120
So the song list is terrible.

256
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,440
The interface is set up like a, what?

257
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
No wonder it was 30 bucks.

258
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
It was 40.

259
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
You overpaid.

260
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
What's that?

261
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,440
You overpaid.

262
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
I like this.

263
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,360
Islander in our chat says, was Rob trying to sign his computer headphones with his butt?

264
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,540
Apparently, apparently.

265
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,760
I mean, it's not just the song list that's offensive, but the interface is just crap.

266
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,080
Like there's really nothing to it.

267
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,000
The videos are just very generic videos.

268
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,760
They didn't even like, it's just like, they didn't even try.

269
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,820
And when you put this game next to the universe games on DDR, which granted at the time they

270
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,600
came out, were just kind of okay.

271
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,320
Now you don't realize how good those fucking games were compared to this.

272
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,960
Like I actually, I've got the most value out of this game using the dance pad because my

273
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,440
old one was long destroyed.

274
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,120
I've been using the dance pad to go back and play DDR universe one and two.

275
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
That is what I've been using.

276
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,600
I have two of those dance pads that are still folded up.

277
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,920
I never actually use them.

278
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,860
They're still folded up in my closet because I got, way back in the day when we actually

279
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,480
used to get free shit from publishers at my work.

280
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,960
I got a couple of the dance bundles and I played the games and yeah, I didn't really

281
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
care for them.

282
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
I sold those.

283
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,680
I kept the dance pads because hey, you never know when you might need a dance pad or might

284
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,720
need to hack one apart to, you know, make a DDR heart pad.

285
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,440
Yeah, I'm going to our chat, my chat that orange knows radio.com.

286
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,040
I have an issue with websites tonight.

287
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,160
Tiger class says, so what sky is trying to say, DDR three 60 is an abomination.

288
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,320
Uh, yes.

289
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,360
And don't forget, this is the same game that's on the PS three only.

290
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,520
It has moved support.

291
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,920
So whoopee, you get to wave your arms to wait, wait, but this has vision camera support.

292
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,040
If it does, I don't know where it is because I didn't see an option for it.

293
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,800
I thought that does the connect not read the same way as a vision cam.

294
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Yes, it should.

295
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
They should.

296
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,760
If it's in there, I didn't find it, I really didn't give a shit.

297
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,520
Um, and it's also on the Wii.

298
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
And here's the hilarious part.

299
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,080
If you look up videos of the Wii version, the Wii version actually kind of looks like

300
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,480
the arcade versions.

301
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,780
I'm saying the Wii versions interface looks better than the three 60 and presumably PS

302
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,200
three versions.

303
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,400
So you explain that one to me, all these weird combo things that are supposed to add points.

304
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,580
I didn't even understand.

305
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:13,540
And then the mode where you unlock stuff is the club mode, which is just nonstop mode.

306
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,720
So that the songs come nonstop and occasionally the difficulty will just randomly change in

307
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,380
the song or the arrows will move faster, slower.

308
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:26,840
And then unexplainably, the way you unlock songs is you gain meters on songs that you

309
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
do well in.

310
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,200
But if you miss steps, then you don't get as much because the difficulty would, I can't

311
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,280
even fucking explain it.

312
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,140
Like this game is just poopy, poopy, caca, terrible.

313
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,720
And it makes me sad as somebody who liked DDR so much.

314
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,640
It is time for the Dance Dance Revolution franchise to be revoked from Konami.

315
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,480
They no longer deserve to have that franchise based on this game.

316
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,040
I truly believe that somehow some divine being needs to come into Konami.

317
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,880
I don't know how this happens, but somehow there needs to be a legal decision.

318
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,000
The Supreme court should be involved in a seven, two decision to revoke DDR from Konami.

319
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes.

320
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I realize they're a Japanese company.

321
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't care.

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,200
It's like somehow that needs to happen where they are no longer allowed to make Dance Dance

323
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Revolution.

324
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Give it to me.

325
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:17,320
I'll, I'll, I'll, you know, clothe it, you know, take it in, give it some shelter.

326
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,200
So anyhow, by the way, by the way, while I was playing that random nonstop mode, guess

327
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,160
what awesome DDR jam started playing?

328
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Like, yeah.

329
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,560
Uh, because you know, sometimes there's, um, you know, there's these, there's the, the

330
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,600
American songs you would expect to cross over, like some of the eighties classics, like,

331
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,200
uh, you know, walk like an Egyptian and so forth.

332
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,200
But Oh man, I just couldn't believe my ears.

333
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,680
I always thought this was such a, uh, great dance song and I've always wanted to play

334
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:58,520
this in DDR step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, die.

335
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Who is this?

336
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:08,080
Oh, I don't listen to her because when I hear this song, I think DDR.

337
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Okay.

338
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,320
And I think about anti-abortionists because it's called dance dance revolution.

339
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,400
That's not dance music.

340
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,200
You can't do anything other than slow dance to it.

341
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,800
Are you gonna see someone break out into like some sort of, you know, break dance routine

342
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
to that shit?

343
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
No, you can't.

344
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,680
You can't dance to it cause it's too fucking slow.

345
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Low key.

346
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,360
Hold me tight and we'll dance to battlefield.

347
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,000
It's the four player mode.

348
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Hold each other's hands.

349
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,880
Oh, Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

350
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,800
Did that have like, was it the quality?

351
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,360
Why does love feel like a battlefield?

352
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Now?

353
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Did they have the new pads with the eight arrows or some garbage?

354
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,800
It's the exact same fucking pad that came with the universe.

355
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,400
Like clearly the surplus that got sent back to Konami headquarters was just packaged in

356
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,760
this game.

357
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:59,680
All right.

358
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,000
Break man in our chat room.

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,320
What the fuck is going on tonight?

360
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,880
Loki likes games, sky is angry and dark soccer is quiet.

361
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,640
I like games all the time.

362
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:16,360
Have you heard me talk negative about saints road the third, grand theft auto, uh, motor

363
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:24,920
store apocalypse, um, I'm sure there's other games in there that I liked.

364
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:30,880
So I, in our chat room, uh, we have free- And, and, and this goes back a few mixes ago,

365
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,920
but what is the fucking abomination that is the new dynamite rave?

366
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
What the fuck is that?

367
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,160
I'm not even going to, I'm not even going to try.

368
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,840
Uh, we also have Frisbee.

369
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Was it Frisbee?

371
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Yeah.

372
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,640
Frisbee in our chat room says, this is like Kelly Clarkson in supernova PlayStation two.

373
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,040
Well, I'm so glad you brought that up because guess what?

374
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,080
Another one of those awesome songs in the track list is

375
00:19:51,080 --> 00:20:05,600
At least that's danceable at least like that one didn't, I mean, lover or a hater, at least

376
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:14,480
you can kind of dance to that.

377
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
That one.

378
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,840
Not so terrible, but come on.

379
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:27,120
It's, it's all right to have like one of those songs in there, but not, I get that the songs

380
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,920
like that to cross over to mainstream audience.

381
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
That's fine.

382
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,960
I don't have a problem with that song being in DDR, but like the Jordan sparks and Leona

383
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Lewis.

384
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,840
And I like Leona Lewis when I'm feeling sad, anyhow, let me talk about a game that was

385
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,920
a much better investment.

386
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,560
As you know, going on right now, steam is having a sale.

387
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,120
Uh, there's tons and tons of stuff that's discounted on steam right now.

388
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,320
One of the games I grabbed on sale was bit trip runner was $2 and 50 cents on steam.

389
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,640
Um, somehow I stepped into the twilight zone where that's the game I should have paid $40

390
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,840
for and DDR was worth about $2 and 50 cents because bit trip runner is cool.

391
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,400
And like, I wasn't expecting a whole lot of out of this game cause you know, bit trip

392
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,920
beat was neat, but it kind of like the shtick got old pretty fast.

393
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,880
So the whole pong thing, um, but I liked bit trip runner a lot.

394
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,400
Like it really reminds me of an old school 2,600 game, like what it would look like today

395
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,320
with the chip to music, very simple controls, but a lot of that whole kind of repetition

396
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,440
about how to learn to beat a level and, and, uh, I even throwbacks to the classic Atari

397
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,400
console with the whole, uh, bonus levels looking like pitfall complete with a noisy television.

398
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,840
Like if you've ever tried to hook up, uh, on an old TV with the RF switch, you get that

399
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,760
noise in there mixed with your game.

400
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,840
Like I just loved the way it looked like a bit trip runner was a great deal.

401
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,760
For two 50, I played more of that game than I did the $40 DDR game.

402
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
Just say him.

403
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,480
So bit trip runner, I endorsed that game, especially if you could call it a music game

404
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,600
cause yeah, it involves chip tunes, but to me that's kind of the niche that makes it

405
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
that much more awesome.

406
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,800
Like to me, it's just like a classic Atari game.

407
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:08,720
What it would look like today, just the chip tune element makes it attractive to those

408
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,600
that maybe don't always care for the simplistic games, if that makes sense.

409
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,240
So, um, let's see, anything else I played this week?

410
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
I checked out some demos.

411
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,600
I don't always like to review games based on the demos, but I'll quickly say I checked

412
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,520
out the 32nd hero super mega Neo climax, uh, game on the Xbox 360.

413
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,720
I own the PSP version of that.

414
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,480
So I wanted to see what it looked like on 360.

415
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,880
I like how the 360 has the completely different art modes that look completely different.

416
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,080
They have the cell shaded hand drawn mode, which is pretty cool, but they also have the

417
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,740
retro mode, which looks more like the PSP version or an eight bit Nintendo classic.

418
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,640
So that, that was pretty cool.

419
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,160
Um, let's see, uh, and, um, what was the other demo I played?

420
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,760
Oh, Galaga legions DX.

421
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,000
I think I'm going to buy that one.

422
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,500
That one was really cool.

423
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,440
That was kind of like geometry wars with the whole Pac-Man championship edition elements

424
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,680
in it with the music and everything.

425
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,040
Cause by the same team, if I'm not mistaken, but it played a little more like geometry

426
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,260
wars, but it doesn't play like the old Galaga games at all.

427
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,140
So I thought that was kind of neat.

428
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,440
Going to our chat room at a chat dot orange lounge, radio.com, uh, Izzam in our chat room

429
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,640
says bit trip is more rhythm puzzle than anything else.

430
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,040
Yeah, I could see that I rhythm puzzle, I think is a good way to describe it.

431
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,280
Um, let's see, uh, going into our chat room, uh, black Wolf says, Hey, that's not the Glee

432
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
version.

433
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,300
That sucks.

434
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,360
And break man says, I hear Glee versions of songs every time I go to target.

435
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Yeah.

436
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,360
That's the other awesome music franchise.

437
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
The Konami is doing right now.

438
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
Glee karaoke revolution.

439
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
Awesome.

440
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
But you know what?

441
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,320
I, it sells for them, I guess.

442
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,920
I mean, I don't know.

443
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,480
Yeah, I don't know either.

444
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
All right.

445
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:56,760
So I bet you all are dying to know more about, um, the game that I'm giving away here on

446
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
the program.

447
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,320
Uh, at the top of the show, I said, uh, who wants to win my birthday present?

448
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,080
And we are going to give that away, but to tell us more about, uh, the birthday present,

449
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,740
uh, I'm going to call the person who bought it for me.

450
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,960
And this is my significant other salacious pop that we're going to bring on the line.

451
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Yes, that's right.

452
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,760
I'm giving away the present that my significant other bought for me.

453
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,320
And we're gonna talk about why.

454
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,240
Um, he actually ordered a copy of a child of Eden for me online.

455
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,720
And I want to talk about why we are giving away once it arrived, while we're giving it

456
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
away.

457
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Hi.

458
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
Yeah.

459
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Hey, how you doing?

460
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
I'm doing all right.

461
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
All right.

462
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,560
So we're giving away a game on tonight's show and it's a present you bought me for my birthday.

463
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,080
Now you went to buy me a copy of child of Eden, right?

464
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Yes.

465
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
All right.

466
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,360
So tell the listeners about how we get from your buying me child of Eden on my birthday

467
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,640
to me giving away my present here on the show.

468
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,240
Well, I decided that that was definitely what you needed to get for your birthday.

469
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,500
So I went on a hunt online to try and find it at a good price because I wasn't really

470
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,800
prepared to, um, you know, drop the 60 bones or whatever it costs at target.

471
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,520
So I checked out Amazon and a bunch of other sites and I just wasn't happy with, you know,

472
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,320
how, uh, what they were offering it for.

473
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,120
So I ended up, uh, through Google shopping.

474
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,000
I ended up on eBay and I'm sure already some people in studio might know where this story

475
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
is going.

476
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,640
Um, I found a lot of retailers with tens of thousands of feedback, positive score that

477
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,920
I could have got it from, but I found this one sort of dog and pony show seller with

478
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,380
a feedback score of five or six, um, selling child of Eden and a bunch of other games like

479
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,480
halo reach and you know, Madden 11 and a bunch of other stuff new, um, shrink wrapped in

480
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,120
America for what I thought was a good price.

481
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,720
And at least it was a feedback of one or higher.

482
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,680
It wasn't some new eBay account, right?

483
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,600
It was like, yeah, it was five, um, which is still pretty low for the fact that they

484
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,640
have like 80 auctions running at once.

485
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,320
So I was like, all right, I am going to give this a shot and I sell a ton of stuff on eBay

486
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,200
and I take it very seriously.

487
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,820
So I think I kind of projected the fact that I'm a legit EJ seller onto this stranger person.

488
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:14,000
So um, I buy it and three days later when I get my tracking number, I see that for one

489
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I noticed that they closed their account.

490
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,160
So they've unregistered from eBay and their feedback score is now zero.

491
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,800
Um, and I look at the tracking number and it is from China and anyone who ever orders

492
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,240
anything on eBay knows that if your item comes from China, it is a counterfeit.

493
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,640
It's a bootleg because the piracy market over in China and Taiwan is millions and millions

494
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
of dollars of counterfeit titles.

495
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,960
So I was like, well shit, it's going to take this game three weeks to get to me and it's

496
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,120
obviously fake.

497
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,520
So uh, it arrived on Thursday, I open it and here's the punchline.

498
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,900
Yes, it is a counterfeit.

499
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:58,920
Obviously it's, it's, I'm surprised at how good the quality is, but it's not good enough.

500
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,800
Like you can tell like, wow, they, they printed this on a very high quality, expensive color

501
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
laser printer.

502
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,640
Yeah, it definitely looks like a color copy like, but, but it's very, it's, it's very

503
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
high quality.

504
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,040
But if you look closely, you can just, you can just kind of see that ink, inkjet, little

505
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,440
dotting, you know, you know what I mean?

506
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,320
If you ever look at an original and an inkjet side by side, you can tell the difference.

507
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Yeah.

508
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,360
So, um, it obviously it's a counterfeit and if you look at the underside of the disc,

509
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,520
you can see that it's, you know, like a DVD are that they, you know, just bought a huge

510
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,980
spindle of them.

511
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,160
But the game wasn't even a counterfeit child of Eden.

512
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,440
It was a counterfeit pal edition.

513
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,560
So they bootlegged the European version of Assassin's Creed brotherhood.

514
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:46,080
So it's a bootleg game from China that the pal version whammy number two, that's the

515
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,200
wrong counterfeit game from what I ordered.

516
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Whammy number three.

517
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,360
So that is some yackety sacks, Benny Hill theme shit right there.

518
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,280
So we want to give, and before we had the call tonight, I asked you to pick a number

519
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,680
from one to, um, of all the people in chat who said that they wanted my 360 games.

520
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:11,800
So we want to congratulate Kaijuto won a copy bootleg copy of Assassin's Creed brotherhood

521
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:22,560
pal edition on the Xbox 360 signed by dark soccer is, but my birthday present because

522
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,080
I care about the listeners, I am giving away my birthday present.

523
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,320
So yeah, I opened a case for it on eBay and I'm confident that I'm going to get my money

524
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
back.

525
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,720
Um, the price that I got it for was sort of in that nebulous too good to be true, but

526
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,800
I could see someone selling the game for cheap at this amount.

527
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,520
So even if I get screwed over, which I doubt I will, it's not a horrible heartbreaking

528
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,920
amount of money, but not come on eBay.

529
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,900
It's not completely unreasonable for someone to sell stuff for cheap.

530
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:55,760
For example, I take games sometimes that I get for free and I just don't want them and

531
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,960
I don't really care what I get for them.

532
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,240
So I started the auction at one penny and whatever they end at, that's what they sell

533
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
for.

534
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,760
So a lot of times, you know, I think a brink was one that went recently.

535
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,400
It went for $24 so it's not unreasonable for that to happen.

536
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,560
Of course, my self, my feedback rating is not five.

537
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,080
It is much higher than that.

538
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,400
But you know, yeah, mine's like 86 and you can actually click on the history and see

539
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
what they are.

540
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,320
But yeah, when I had it, when I had a bunch of, um, uh, adult DVDs from that job, I had

541
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,480
like dozens of them that were shrink wrapped that cost, you know, 60 bucks down at the

542
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
bookstore.

543
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,000
I sold them on the adult section of eBay for a penny and some of them only went for 10

544
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,960
bucks and they were perfectly brand new retail good items.

545
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,480
So I absolutely understand how that could happen.

546
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,160
So you thought maybe you'd find somebody like you who was just giving away their excess

547
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:48,040
promo copies of child of Eden, but unfortunately you got a pal copy that's not even real of

548
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,360
Assassin's Creed of the game that I didn't order.

549
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Yeah, exactly.

550
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,240
So tiger claw in our chat room says, what's the moral of the story?

551
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,360
Don't order from Amazon.

552
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,840
Actually I think you got the moral mixed up.

553
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,780
It's it's it's don't order from eBay.

554
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:06,620
Order from a quote legit store like Amazon or Best Buy or fries or whatever the hell

555
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,620
you want.

556
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:13,320
Usually, even though, even though PayPal is evil, usually when it comes to shit like this,

557
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,320
they usually side with the buyer.

558
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,120
So yeah, and there are lots of legit reseller or sellers on eBay that have their own website,

559
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,320
but they all just have an eBay account and you'll know that they're legit because their

560
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,080
feedback score is in the tens of thousands and those are the ones that you should stick

561
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
to.

562
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,700
So a break man in our chat room says, wait, WTF, if I would ever try to give away a gift

563
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,720
from my girl, she would fucking kill me.

564
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,720
So are you going to fucking kill me?

565
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,380
Well we've we found an even better solution to get you your child of Eden fix and I get

566
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,380
to play it too.

567
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,460
So no, I'm not, I'm not too heartbroken over this.

568
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,640
And we can go ahead and share what we ended up doing instead.

569
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,840
It's actually kind of in an ironic way.

570
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
It's actually kind of funny.

571
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
This worked out this way.

572
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Yeah.

573
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,480
I'm a listener of O.L.R.

574
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,520
I'm what I'm trying to think of his name is a screen name.

575
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:09,680
Mieglotov called us today told us that on best buy.com or the brick and mortar store

576
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:15,620
if you have one nearby for today and tomorrow, connect games are two for one.

577
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:21,200
So we picked up child of Eden and a fitness game that looked like a fitness game that

578
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,040
wasn't actually horrible.

579
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
We got both of those.

580
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,560
So that's, that's your birthday present or those two games.

581
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,880
So I ended up getting a two for one deal on which fitness game, I think the year fitness.

582
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
Oh, that's not bad.

583
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Yeah.

584
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
I mean, I trust me.

585
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
We looked.

586
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,600
We're like, okay, Zumba fitness is the one that's selling really well in Europe.

587
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Went to Metacritic.

588
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,440
It's 40 something unless you like Latin dancing and I'm talking about Latin female dancing.

589
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,320
I do like Latin female dancing.

590
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,040
Yeah, it was.

591
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Yeah.

592
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,120
Your shape fitness evolved, which I think is like a 74 on Metacritic fitness game.

593
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
That's pretty good.

594
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
That was pretty good.

595
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,320
They have the sequel coming out this year, but we purposely, we just kind of went to

596
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,460
Metacritic and pick, pick the one with the best score.

597
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,880
So, and that's the one we went with.

598
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,780
So we're like, well, let's get a fitness game because I've actually kind of been into fitness

599
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,240
and all that stuff lately, like trying to walk more, eat better.

600
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,980
I've lost seven pounds in the past two months, so I kind of want to keep that trend going

601
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,600
without having to join a gym, join a gym.

602
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,960
So be cool.

603
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,360
Uh, also, uh, break man in chat says, so basically someone wins Sky's coffee table drink coaster.

604
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,520
Hey, I never said it was a good game.

605
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,960
Why do you think I was given it away?

606
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,080
But Kaijuto says I will put that game up on a plaque, so I'm glad someone, uh, won it

607
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,520
who will appreciate it.

608
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,520
So congratulations.

609
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,040
Once again, you win my birthday bootleg pal copy of the wrong fucking game, Assassin's

610
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:40,320
Creed brotherhood signed by myself, Loki and Dark Sakura's butt.

611
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,640
And uh, I think doesn't Loki probably has a system somewhere that would play it.

612
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,760
That was actually my first reaction.

613
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,400
I'm like, one of Loki's like 10, three sixties could probably play this game.

614
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,280
I don't have 10, three sixties.

615
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:58,560
No, my, my J tag, which, which by the way, I broke this week, but I will be fixing it.

616
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,600
Um, yes, that would probably be able to play that.

617
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,200
But Loki, I've decided I'm going to give it to a listener instead.

618
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,480
In fact, uh, Dan's J tag out there probably could play it.

619
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
All right.

620
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Well, Oh, well.

621
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
All right.

622
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,400
Uh, slashes pop while we have you on anything else you want to share with the listeners?

623
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,280
Um, just that really insane steam sale that's running, I think all week people need to get

624
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
on that.

625
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Some great stuff on there.

626
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Yes.

627
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Indeed.

628
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
Yeah.

629
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
And win tickets and join the OLR group while you're on there.

630
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,280
Hurray.

631
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Yeah.

632
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Yep.

633
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
More information.

634
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Orange owns radio.com.

635
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Okay.

636
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Take care.

637
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Uh, thank you.

638
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
Salacious pop.

639
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Bye.

640
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
Bye.

641
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
And it really is one of those situations where it's the thought that counts.

642
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Like I just laughed it off.

643
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,880
Like I kind of knew he was getting me child of Eden because when I tried to buy it in

644
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,840
the store, he's like, don't you want to wait till after your birthday to buy any big purchases

645
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
like that?

646
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
You know, that, that whole little thing.

647
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,820
So I kind of knew that was coming, but you know, it, the story behind it is even better

648
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,920
than just the game showing up on the doorstep.

649
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:58,120
You know, and you, you even said ahead of time that you felt or that Alan felt something

650
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
like that might happen.

651
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
Yeah, no.

652
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,680
Well, he knew right away when he bought the game off eBay, but we were all just kind of

653
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
waiting to see.

654
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,600
So we thought we turned it into something fun, like a giveaway.

655
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,360
So I'll get in touch with you guys, you know, a little later and we'll get your address.

656
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,160
Um, probably ship it out after next week's show because I didn't bring it to the show

657
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
tonight.

658
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,160
So we got to get everyone to actually sign it.

659
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
All right.

660
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,120
Anyhow, um, let's move on quickly housekeeping.

661
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:24,200
Uh, if you want to, uh, sign up for our Facebook, you should facebook.com slash orange launch

662
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
radio.

663
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,280
Also we're on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. And as I mentioned before, uh, if you

664
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,280
go to orange lounge radio.com and you are getting in on these steam sales or what have

665
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,000
you, the more of you that are getting into steam for team fortress two or portal to your

666
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,400
copies on PS three that work on steam, what have you, uh, we actually do have our home,

667
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,760
our own little steam community, and you can see that on our website, orange launch radio.com

668
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:53,280
on the left hand side is a little button for steam, uh, in the extended play section, steam

669
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,120
community.com slash groups slash O L R. So there you go.

670
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
All right.

671
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,040
Um, let's get into tonight's news.

672
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
There actually is a lot of gaming news too this week.

673
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,520
Uh, so let's get right into it.

674
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
Loki, start us off.

675
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
What's going on in the news.

676
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,520
Uh, yes.

677
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,360
Um, we talked a little bit about this on our teas with, um, Bobby, but a resident evil

678
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:18,560
mercenary 3d just came out last week and there was a big controversy over the fact that Capcom

679
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,600
decided, Hey, guess what?

680
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,900
You know that save game that, uh, data that you have on there, it cannot be reset.

681
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,760
So for example, say you get really far in the game and you decide to sell it and then

682
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,320
the next person that buys it, uh, they're stuck with your save game and having everything

683
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,640
being unlocked.

684
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:43,320
Um, it was funny because actually at one point GameStop and a lot of the major retailers

685
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,560
out there were not going to be taking the game in as a trade.

686
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,600
I guess, um, they've reversed their policy on that, but, um, you know, they're saying

687
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,520
if upon further review the process with our publishing, our publisher partner, Capcom,

688
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:03,160
uh, GameStop will resume taking trades on the game effective Wednesday, June 29th makes

689
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:12,080
me wonder a couple things here, one, um, so GameStop probably bitched the Capcom to it's

690
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,720
all okay all of a sudden.

691
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,120
So it makes you wonder if they either they're just fine with the fact that you can't reset

692
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:23,000
your save or there's maybe like a key combination or something like that where GameStop can

693
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,720
reset your save, which if that were the case, it'd probably go interesting.

694
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,840
I didn't know if, if that's the case that will leak out in seconds.

695
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,880
That'll be on GameFacts.com within five seconds of that code being given to a GameStop employee.

696
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,280
Um, overseas though it says a retailer HMV has ceased taking trades in for the title.

697
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,200
EB Games Australia has also stopped stocking the game altogether and, um, you know, they're

698
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,480
just saying if, you know, EB Games, I guess, if you would like to purchase it with us and

699
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,800
of course we will sell it to you, it will be a case of an order within our, or with

700
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
our store.

701
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,360
And it says we made, we made the tough decision to remove it from sale because we had everybody's

702
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,880
best interest in mind and don't feel that it's fair that you guys would be paying, this

703
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,440
is $60 Australian, for what is essentially one, a one use game.

704
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,800
So I mean, let's, let's get back to the root problem here because amongst the whole ninth

705
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,480
anniversary show and the fact that this news kind of came out on a Sunday last week, we

706
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,400
kind of overlooked this story.

707
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,920
Um, in what fucking universe was this a good game design idea to not reset the save file?

708
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:36,440
Like I, I, I get the defense is the whole, well it's like an arcade game and I, I, I'm

709
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,880
just saying that is the defense.

710
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,560
I'm not saying I understand it, but that is the whole like, well it's, it's like an arcade

711
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,420
game and it's not detrimental.

712
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,560
So what?

713
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,920
Like I hate it when game companies try to tell me what I want as a gamer because that's

714
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,080
what the gamers want.

715
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,760
No, I'm telling you that's not what I want.

716
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,600
I do sometimes like to reset my games and start from scratch.

717
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,360
I did it on Final Fantasy 13 a few weeks ago.

718
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,560
It's like an arcade game.

719
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Okay.

720
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
That's your defense sin.

721
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,960
Arcade cabinets, I can reset the goddamn high score.

722
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,880
In fact, Capcom arcade games, I can reset the high score on.

723
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,000
So where's your logic there?

724
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It doesn't make sense.

725
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,440
I mean, clearly somebody made this decision and I think this decision absolutely was made

726
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,240
to impact the used market because somebody made a conscious decision not to let the game

727
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:32,480
save to the 3DS card internal memory like all the other freaking 3DS games do where

728
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,300
if you wanted to reset your data, oh, it's as easy as deleting the file.

729
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,200
How easy is that?

730
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,400
Somebody made the conscious decision, no, we don't want to do that.

731
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,840
We're specifically moving it to the cart and not making it deleteable.

732
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,560
But now they've come up with all this crap to kind of back talk their way into how that

733
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,560
was a great decision and it's where the game industry is going.

734
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
It's really what you wanted.

735
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,260
Yeah, it's what we wanted.

736
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,800
You wanted an arcade experience, didn't you?

737
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,120
No, I didn't really want to play the mercenary missions from 4 and 5 ported to the 3DS.

738
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,920
I would like, you know, I don't know, maybe a new Resident Evil game.

739
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
Oh, but guess what?

740
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,800
You can play the demo for the new Resident Evil game on this game itself.

741
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,980
So I guess there's something to it.

742
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:23,760
But once again, you know, I mean to be fair, it didn't get very good reviews because apparently

743
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,660
the game wasn't that great.

744
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,040
And so, you know, I don't really consider it a big loss.

745
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,360
It's interesting though because this new story yet has people talking about it.

746
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,600
And despite the fact it was a mediocre game that probably, you know, the Resident Evil

747
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,840
fans would have been, yay, but most other people would have been like, bring on the

748
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,360
other 3DS games.

749
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:48,800
It's another, you know, another entry in the long line of bad DRM decisions from Capcom.

750
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,680
You know, if it's not, oh, this game needs to be online at all times, you know, in order

751
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,480
for it to work even in single player, or like in games that don't even have a multiplayer

752
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,180
component, oh, you know, and then the PlayStation Network goes down and their game stops working

753
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,080
for, you know, a month or whatever.

754
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,600
Alright, so I'm being corrected by the chat room, as tends to happen sometimes on this

755
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
show.

756
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,640
And the chat says, actually Rob, none of the 3DS games I have saved to the SD card.

757
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,200
They all save to the 3DS cart, but you can do data management.

758
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,160
The only things that save to the SD cart are the street pass and maybe data that won't

759
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,220
fit on the cart.

760
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,220
So fine.

761
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,600
I just haven't noticed because there hasn't really been that big RPG 3DS game that I've

762
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,300
wanted to reset the data on so far.

763
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,860
I mean, when all is said and done, would I probably really want to reset the data on

764
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,360
a game like this?

765
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
Probably not.

766
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
Me personally.

767
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Probably not.

768
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,740
I probably wouldn't have noticed this if it hadn't been called out.

769
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,920
But what ticks me off about it is this whole, we all see what you're doing, quit trying

770
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,400
to make excuses to say otherwise.

771
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,800
Like it's very obvious why they're doing this.

772
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Stop lying.

773
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,720
It's because they don't want to piss off the fans.

774
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:01,040
They want to piss off the fans because they're trying to do this to save some money.

775
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,400
Then they are assuming that their fans are stupid and you should be offended.

776
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,320
And really how much money are they saving?

777
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,120
Because this game itself is probably going to sell, what, maybe 400,000 units?

778
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:16,480
And that right there is a really generous estimate.

779
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,480
I mean, 400,000 units in the lifetime of this game.

780
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,280
I mean, we're talking like maybe a few 10,000 copies or whatever that they're going to lose

781
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,940
out sales on because someone's going to buy it used.

782
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:39,200
And of saying like 25% of those copies are going to sell for used or something like that.

783
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,680
How many people are you really turning away from putting this feature on there?

784
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,960
I mean, what, maybe let's just say 10,000 of those people.

785
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:51,360
That's such a minor, minor, minor number compared to people are just not going to give a shit

786
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,800
or they just won't buy your game.

787
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,440
I mean, I don't know.

788
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
It's stupid.

789
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,000
Black Wolf in our chat room says, hey, this is an investment opportunity, buy five copies

790
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,440
this week, save them for three years and sell them as unopened on eBay for a hundred dollars

791
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
each profit.

792
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
I don't know.

793
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,880
I don't know if that will work if the game is only kind of mediocre.

794
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,640
However, I say at the end of the day, vote with your wallet.

795
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,320
That's really what it boils down to.

796
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,340
Now, to be honest, I probably wouldn't have bought this game anyway, but I especially

797
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,560
wouldn't have bought, like if I was on the fence, I would have said, no, I don't really

798
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
want to support this.

799
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,480
Well, that's what was going through my head the whole time is why the crap would I buy

800
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
that game?

801
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,880
There hasn't been a good resident evil game since three.

802
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,400
Oh, come on.

803
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,400
Four.

804
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
I like it.

805
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
Oh, Oh my God.

806
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,600
That's one of the best GameCube games, period.

807
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,920
Like I realize everybody has their own opinion.

808
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
That's fine.

809
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,640
But I, I, I cannot agree with you.

810
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,440
My favorite to this day is still two.

811
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,480
I four was like one of the best and I really liked Code Veronica.

812
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,480
Period.

813
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
Wow.

814
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
All right.

815
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,080
I can't agree that five was not what it could have five was not anyhow.

816
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Uh, yeah.

817
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,640
Vote with your wallet kids.

818
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,040
That's really what it boils down to.

819
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,040
All right.

820
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:09,540
Now, speaking of, uh, fun money related decisions and what you support and what you don't, where

821
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,400
the industry is going.

822
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,920
Last week on the show, we talked about the impending Supreme court decision and I got

823
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,880
to admit we were a little bit in the, you know, negative defeatist drone last week where

824
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,680
we were pretty sure that it was going to come out and that the Supreme court was going to

825
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:28,200
uphold the California law and this vague ass law about what is deemed offensive or whatever

826
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,280
would end up with a GameStop employees getting thousand dollar fines and all this crap.

827
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,700
Well, the good news is the Supreme court actually ruled the other way.

828
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,040
They ruled in favor of the video game industry.

829
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:45,520
They overturned the law, so to speak, which really was never essentially effective.

830
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,520
Uh, so in Brown versus entertainment merchants association, which used to be Schwarzenegger

831
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,760
versus entertainment merchants association, but you know, we've had a new governor since

832
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,560
the law first went into effect.

833
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,060
Um, it was reversed in seven to decision.

834
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:05,360
So, uh, they are essentially saying that, yeah, it is a violation of the first amendment

835
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,360
and so forth.

836
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,800
But there were a couple of justices that seemed to be on the fence with this whole thing.

837
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,560
I'm not going to go super, super in depth.

838
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,840
I think a lot of you already kind of read about this.

839
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,160
It was such a huge thing, but there were a couple of justices that were on the fence

840
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,320
with this that were saying like, we understand why there might be a law, just this wasn't

841
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,520
really the way to do it.

842
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,240
The way you're defining offensive here is a little vague, you know, things like that.

843
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,360
So you know, is this all going to be said and done and over with?

844
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,880
I guarantee you it's not.

845
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,600
In fact, there was some reaction this week from Leland Yee, who was the state Senator

846
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,760
who originally drafted this whole bill in the first place.

847
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,080
Uh, he's a Democrat, a Democrat representing San Francisco and, uh, he put together a whole

848
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:53,080
little statement that said that the ruling of the Supreme Court, quote, puts the interests

849
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,320
of corporate America before the interests of children.

850
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,600
As a result of their decision, Walmart and the video game industry will continue to make

851
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,720
billions of dollars at the expense of our kids' mental health and the safety of our

852
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,720
community.

853
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,720
Good God.

854
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:11,560
But if you read the terms, he clearly didn't read the syllabus because, and I read the

855
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:18,120
whole thing, it goes in there to say that the, uh, research that they used was inherently

856
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:24,320
flawed and that actually the same researchers who were trying to make the claim that violent

857
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:32,880
video games were harmful to children said also television, movies, books, Saturday morning

858
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,240
cartoons were all equally harmful.

859
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,440
Well, on top of all that, he's saying it's in the interest of children, well, children

860
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,960
aren't able to purchase, I mean, as it is with the company policies, they're unable

861
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:54,880
to purchase these games in these stores and last time I checked, you know, children don't

862
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,680
have $60 of, you know, they don't have a job, so someone's giving them money.

863
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,320
Someone's obviously purchasing, someone's driving them to the stores to purchase these

864
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,480
games, um, you know, and that person to be a parent and yeah, you know, bikes and stuff

865
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,480
like that.

866
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:17,020
But I mean, come on, it's just take some damn responsibility, let, let the responsibility

867
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,440
lie with the parents.

868
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,580
Well, these also, these same parents keep in mind are encouraging their kids to go play

869
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:27,780
high school football and participate in sports where far more injuries occur as opposed to

870
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:34,440
those related to video games and deaths, oh, don't forget deaths.

871
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:40,000
So uh, by the way, Leland Yi at the end of the day basically said, uh, he's going to

872
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,200
try again because there were a couple of people on the fence.

873
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,000
No, of course you haven't wasted enough taxpayer money yet.

874
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,080
I would like this, okay, so you guys lost the case, Leland Yi, um, so you're gonna pony

875
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,720
up that $2 million that we wasted on this?

876
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,280
You know what else is very interesting about this?

877
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,520
You know, you hear a lot about partisan politics in this nation and this whole like, you know,

878
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,440
Republican, Democrat stuff going on here.

879
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,040
This really is one of those things that doesn't seem to fall on one party or the other.

880
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,760
I mean, yes, a Democrat wrote it, but then when you look at who in the Supreme Court

881
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:16,180
decided to dissent against the majority and actually side with Leland Yi, one of those

882
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:21,280
justices was Clarence Thomas, who was a Herbert Walker Bush nominee to the court.

883
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,480
The other one being Breyer, a Clinton, appointee to the court.

884
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,280
So this, this isn't partisan either, which is interesting.

885
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,000
I think there's so many issues in America where it's like, you know, it's a Republican

886
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,560
issue or it's a Democrat issue, but this is one of those things that's really all over

887
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,560
the map.

888
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,560
Partisan politics is bullshit anyway.

889
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:42,320
It's trying to add regulation for something that there's already regulation for.

890
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:48,000
I suggest that they go in there and we need to enact some sort of force that'll go out

891
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,320
there and stop people from committing laws.

892
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,260
You know, um, it'll, it'll work above the police department because, you know, we've

893
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:00,440
got the police department there, but I think we need a special military police department

894
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,440
or something.

895
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,600
I mean, that's almost kind of what this is like to the extreme, obviously.

896
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,640
The other thing in the wording of the decision was that they were picking a scapegoat to

897
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,680
treat a serious social problem that was not at the heart of the problem, that they're

898
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:20,120
only picking one thing that may actually more be a symptom of the social issue.

899
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,120
And that they, you know, they understand parents have a right to want a little bit more assistance

900
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:31,760
from the government and which I think is bullshit, but, um, the whole point is that it's basically

901
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,240
the government shall not step in on your personal liberties.

902
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,000
We've already had enough of that going on.

903
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,760
This is where we draw the line.

904
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,100
And I don't understand the whole needing for education for the ESRB ratings.

905
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,120
Does anybody need education for the movie MPAA ratings?

906
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,960
I've never seen somebody go, oh, I don't know what an R rated movie has in it.

907
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,600
I mean, does that ever confuse anybody?

908
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:01,300
Because I see no point to this excuse anyways that, oh, as a parent, I don't understand

909
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:06,320
English on the back of my box that says violence, nudity, does this game contain violence and

910
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,320
nudity?

911
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,320
Oh, well, it says right there that it does.

912
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
I mean, so.

913
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,360
But the issue, and I'm not even going to say this flat out as a parental issue.

914
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,440
I'm going to say this as an essentially American issue.

915
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,160
People are fucking lazy.

916
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,800
Nobody wants to think for themselves.

917
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,360
They want everything handed to them on a plate that says, here, here's everything spelled

918
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,360
out for you.

919
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,880
So now it's easy.

920
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,760
We're going to take out the hard work part of it.

921
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,200
Did you see the part?

922
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,840
Did you see the whole thing being discussed on the Daily Show?

923
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,840
Did you see that whole clip of Jon Stewart talking about it?

924
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,600
I watched some of it in the moment that he said he supported Adele of the Room.

925
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,340
Well, I didn't think, I didn't get that impression necessarily supported it.

926
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,900
It sure seemed like it watching it.

927
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,200
But then there was part of me that was like, it was very tongue in cheek, like, is this

928
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,060
kind of like tongue in cheek onion style humor that maybe we're just not getting?

929
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,680
Because what amazed me about it is as he was talking about the bill and, you know, these

930
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,080
horrible games that would be sold, yet he was showing clips uncensored of the games

931
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:05,240
on his program that I could just turn on my television and watch.

932
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,120
So granted primetime.

933
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,960
I was like, surely this is like just highbrow humor that I'm not getting.

934
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,680
No, I think he was actually serious.

935
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,460
If you knew nothing about the issue at all and you were just presented this, oh, hey,

936
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,800
there was a law that was going to ban these violent games from going, you know, ending

937
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,800
up in children's laps, then you could see, oh, well, you know, why did they vote against

938
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,800
that?

939
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,720
I mean, that doesn't make any sense why they would vote against, you know, these violent

940
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,360
games going to kids' laps.

941
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,560
Until you explain that, hey, there's already regulation in place, you know, done by these

942
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,680
retailers where they're not selling this stuff to people.

943
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,040
And there's also not this sort of regulation, you know, done by the law for any other type

944
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,140
of media, including TV.

945
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:52,800
So I mean, that's the point that he forgot to point out, because, you know, it's more

946
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,740
interesting to have, you know, this violent imagery on screen and him going, you know,

947
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,000
because that gets him raided.

948
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,520
One point that Dan brought up was that now this might set a precedent for people to basically

949
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,640
sue a company for not selling the game, like when they've sent their kid in to go buy it.

950
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,800
And the company says no.

951
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:17,040
But it is part of the business that you have the sign that says we reserve a right to refuse

952
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,040
service to anyone.

953
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,040
That's what I pointed out.

954
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,440
No shirts, no shoes, no service.

955
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,080
That's what I pointed out.

956
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,560
And I'm like, that's not going to be an issue.

957
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,480
And he thinks it's going to be otherwise, but I'm like, it's not going to be an issue.

958
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,760
A business has the right to refuse service.

959
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,400
As long as it's not, you know, discriminatory.

960
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:39,400
And really, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter to me too much because I'm an adult,

961
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,160
so it's not going to restrict the thing for me, although it's just, you know, if violent

962
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,960
video games have this kind of stigma, then, yeah, a publisher may be more apt to censor

963
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,720
the game a bit so that it receives a little rain.

964
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,400
But who's to say, you know, that a teen rated game could be deemed, you know, violent enough

965
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,400
to fall under this?

966
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,400
That's the problem with it.

967
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,440
Going to our chat room at chat.org.com, Salacious Pop is actually commenting in our chat room

968
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,440
right now and saying, Loki, there's actually two movies where that happened.

969
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,280
I think talking about some of the violence.

970
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,440
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which was PG, made parents flip their shit.

971
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,680
It's why PG-13 was invented.

972
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,680
That's right.

973
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,400
I saw faces melting when I was a kid and I turned out okay.

974
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,960
Remember that scene?

975
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Yeah.

976
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,880
And it's so fake now, but when you were a kid, you like close your eyes.

977
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,160
No, I'll tell you, you know what?

978
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,160
I will tell you what?

979
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,160
I saw Gremlins.

980
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,840
I'm going to tell you what movie scene scared the fucking shit out of me when I was a kid.

981
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,360
And you look back on it now and you're like, that is so dopey.

982
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,620
But I'll tell you what, anybody in chat who's in their lower thirties is going to know exactly

983
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,200
what their high twenties is going to know exactly what I'm talking about.

984
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,200
Okay.

985
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Ready?

986
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,200
It was in Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

987
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,200
Oh my God.

988
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,200
Yeah.

989
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:49,680
When he gets in the truck with large Marge and she does this, she's telling the story

990
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,600
on a night just like this, right?

991
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:59,680
And then she goes, and it looked like this whole like claymation thing, right?

992
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:05,680
Like little kids bursting into tears across the country, scarred for life will never like,

993
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,840
I still can't watch that scene.

994
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,360
It's why we are afraid of truckers.

995
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,960
Our generation is afraid of truckers.

996
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,600
My daddy was a trucker.

997
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,480
Then we're afraid of your daddy.

998
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,480
Actually my dad is still a trucker.

999
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,760
And it's all large Marge's fault.

1000
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,760
But you know what?

1001
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,760
That was a PG movie.

1002
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,400
One of my, no, that scene actually, I still can't watch it.

1003
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,480
And I actually had a friend had that as their Facebook picture and I messaged them and asked

1004
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,600
them very nicely if they would remove it because that was a very traumatic scene.

1005
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,200
Do not find the damn picture, Rob.

1006
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,200
Oh my God.

1007
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,200
No, no, no.

1008
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,200
I'm not finding the picture.

1009
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,440
I just want to make sure the movie was rated PG.

1010
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,440
Where was it?

1011
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,440
I think it was.

1012
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,000
I just, I, cause I'd be on the art world.

1013
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Check IMDB.

1014
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,480
See, look, I can't figure out what this freaking movie is rated.

1015
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,480
Like should it be this?

1016
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,480
Rob, IMDB.

1017
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,480
IMDB.

1018
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,760
But you know, actually there was one movie that I saw when I was a kid and it was rated

1019
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,460
our movie and I went to see it with my uncle.

1020
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,160
I've seen tons of rated our movies when I was a little kid.

1021
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,220
It's PG.

1022
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,220
Thank you.

1023
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,220
IMDB.

1024
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,380
And this is the only movie rated R that ever scared me.

1025
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,760
And now today you will laugh at this.

1026
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,760
What?

1027
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,760
It was poultry guys three.

1028
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,760
Oh wow.

1029
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,440
And then I was afraid of mirrors for like a week.

1030
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,440
Have you seen it?

1031
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,240
I was afraid of mirrors for like a week and then I thought that I would die.

1032
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,520
Like like what's like Heather O'Rourke.

1033
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,000
And then after a week I was like, Oh yeah, it's stupid.

1034
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,520
I would love to see as a challenge to filmmakers out there to see what kind of, how fucked

1035
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,240
up of a movie they could make and have it still be rated G because that would be awesome.

1036
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,200
Well, look at any Disney movie.

1037
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,880
I mean, okay, Tarzan, we've all seen that Disney movie, right?

1038
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,880
Yeah.

1039
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,880
Spoiler alert.

1040
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:54,960
The main villain dies in the movie by being strangled to death by falling down with vines

1041
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,760
wrapped around his neck with his neck broken and they show the silhouette of it.

1042
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,620
I was like, this is very violent for kids.

1043
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,380
Or how about Snow White?

1044
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,120
Almost all Disney villains die by falling off a cliff and then it's, you just see that

1045
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,920
little poof of smoke.

1046
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:19,260
Or how about Snow White movie from, what was it, 1947 wasn't it?

1047
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:24,020
The queen is the old witch trying to push the boulder down the hill and instead lightning

1048
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,020
strikes her.

1049
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,360
She falls off the cliff and the boulder lands on her.

1050
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,680
Okay, right.

1051
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,120
Lots of people in chat talking about the large Marge scene and how actually there were a

1052
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,240
lot of people that apparently were scared by that.

1053
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,360
Dungeon Buster mentions the death of Optimus Prime.

1054
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,600
Let's see.

1055
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,160
I hope I'm saying this right.

1056
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:48,600
Rade, or maybe that's Raid, Rade says, oh Jesus, large Marge, that scarred me for life.

1057
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,100
Break Man says, yeah, that was scary because it was so unexpected.

1058
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,420
And Frisbee says, I still can't watch that.

1059
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,540
So you're not alone.

1060
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,000
And of course, SSJ100 Matt provides a YouTube link if you want to see that.

1061
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,920
Zethur, another one here, the boat scene in Willy Wonka scared me shitless.

1062
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,520
Dude, that movie was fucked up.

1063
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
It was.

1064
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,480
Like, I don't like the new one.

1065
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,840
The old one is far more fucked up.

1066
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:13,960
I appreciate them both, but the old one, I was actually a child when I saw the old one

1067
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,480
and it was kind of fucked up.

1068
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,480
I was a little afraid.

1069
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,200
When she's a bad egg and she falls through the chute and all these, I want the world,

1070
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,040
I want the whole world.

1071
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,960
There is no way of knowing where exactly we are going.

1072
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,640
I was afraid of Gene Wilder when I was little for a while, for a while.

1073
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,640
Our whole generation.

1074
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,640
I mean, where do you think?

1075
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,760
Why are we not more screwed up?

1076
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,920
And yet we all turned out fine.

1077
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,240
Yeah, we turned out fine.

1078
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:46,160
I'm not saying that kids should be subjected to this violence, but I think that's a parent's

1079
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,160
addiction to make.

1080
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,840
I saw Star Trek 5 in the theater and I'm not fucked up and that was awful.

1081
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,160
I think any parent that's saying, I didn't know what this game was rated or I didn't

1082
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,640
know that this game had violence in it or I didn't know this is just retarded.

1083
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,240
And if you're like, I didn't know how to read the rating system, you're an idiot.

1084
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,300
Can you tell us what our old Saturday morning cartoons were like?

1085
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:09,600
You know, I realize I don't have kids, so maybe some people are not going to value my

1086
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,260
opinion, but whatever, F you, it's my show.

1087
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:18,640
If I had kids, I would want them to see that violence the first time because they're gonna

1088
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,640
see it.

1089
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,840
They're going to see it at a friend's house.

1090
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,740
They're going to see it at some point.

1091
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,020
You're going to see it on CNN.

1092
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,480
They're going to see it when they're flipping through the TV and they'll see it on Comedy

1093
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,480
Central.

1094
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,480
Okay.

1095
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,080
I would rather they see it with me present so we can talk about it.

1096
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,080
Yeah.

1097
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,720
It's just like sexual things, although that's a very uncomfortable subject for a lot of

1098
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,720
parents.

1099
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,280
I don't want my kids to find out from other places.

1100
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,840
And I don't understand the double standard between sexual stuff and violent stuff.

1101
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,840
You have a kid.

1102
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,840
Tell me I'm right.

1103
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,280
So it validates my opinion.

1104
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:54,660
Well, regardless of the ESRB rating, I'm just going to pick games that I think are suitable

1105
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,080
for my child.

1106
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:01,320
And that may be different than like, honestly, if you teach them well enough, they know what

1107
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
fiction is.

1108
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,440
I mean, the people that I'm killing in Grand Theft Auto aren't real people.

1109
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,560
And obviously you don't want to go emulate that on street by going and killing real people,

1110
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:17,600
but they're just AI computer controlled people.

1111
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,640
You can brutally murder them and nothing happens.

1112
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,360
But my point was going back though to Saturday Morning Cartoons, how many of us grew up with,

1113
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,160
you know, Pixie and Dixie, Mr. Jinx?

1114
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,680
Or how about fucking Tom and Jerry?

1115
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,680
Tom and Jerry.

1116
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,680
That shit was vulgar.

1117
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,680
Like, it was very violent.

1118
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:37,340
Well, on top of that, keep in mind that these were, and they banned, and they came actually

1119
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,120
right from vaudeville humor too.

1120
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:44,040
But keep in mind, keep in mind, not only did we have, you know, them beating up on each

1121
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:50,480
other, but if you look at when a lot of these cartoons were made, when certain racial stereotyping

1122
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,320
was considered to be standard humor.

1123
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,660
You know, I grew up watching Tom and Jerry with, you know, Tom and Blackface.

1124
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:02,560
We watched Tom and Jerry cartoons in church.

1125
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,640
I went to a Baptist church when I was younger.

1126
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,440
Let's, we'll save that discussion for another day.

1127
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,760
I was raised in one.

1128
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,760
Yeah.

1129
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,560
I remember there was a lock in, quote unquote, of the church once and we watched Tom and

1130
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,840
Jerry cartoons all night.

1131
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,480
So we watched Song of the South.

1132
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,480
Oh God.

1133
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:23,480
All right, look, I want to move on to other topics, but I, uh, but the point, the point

1134
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,440
is that parents need to do their job.

1135
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,600
It's better that you were there with them to explain it than leave them unexposed.

1136
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:33,200
You know, I did actually know somebody who was pretty much blocked from everything when

1137
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,960
she was growing up and now I didn't know her while she was growing up.

1138
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,240
My friends knew her, but from what I understand, she was a lot more messed up than anyone I

1139
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,960
known who grew up exposed to everything.

1140
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,920
Let me quickly get some comments from chat room, chat dot orange on show.com.

1141
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,560
Break man says, if I ever have kids, I refuse to use cutesy names for things.

1142
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:56,660
I want my kids to know that they have a penis or vagina, not a wee wee or a who, um, bonds

1143
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,000
double six as I agree.

1144
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,680
My mom had us watch a lot of adult shows and movies and personally I don't think it messed

1145
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,680
me up.

1146
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,320
Uh, and then dungeon Buster says, I love the Penn and Teller bullshit show where they looked

1147
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,960
at violent video games.

1148
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,960
That was good.

1149
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,000
Actually, I'll have to find you the clip.

1150
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,640
They get a 13 year old with his mother's permission, put a gun in his hand and they have a trainer

1151
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,640
there.

1152
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,640
You know, it's supervised.

1153
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,640
There's a police officer there.

1154
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,160
They give him an automatic weapon and say, okay, go ahead and shoot it once.

1155
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,400
This is how you do it.

1156
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,240
Shows him the proper everything.

1157
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,240
Oh God.

1158
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,720
The kid shoots the gun, steps back and says, wow, and the guy goes, do you want to do it

1159
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,720
again?

1160
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,020
He says, no, I don't want to touch this thing again.

1161
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:38,760
And then they showed him later on that he was in tears, 13 years old, but he played,

1162
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:46,400
but he goes home and plays so calm and all these violent games yet, you know, is, is

1163
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,800
this the, you know, reaction that those people who are putting out that propaganda want us,

1164
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,920
you know, to think is going to happen?

1165
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,320
I don't know if I would go to that extreme to teach my child, but then again, I have

1166
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,280
an issue with guns, but we'll save that for another episode of the show.

1167
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,560
But you get the point that you're saying, no, I do.

1168
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,560
I do.

1169
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:09,400
So the point was, do these games train kids to be killers and clearly not, first of all,

1170
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,680
he didn't even hit the target or like he hit like way off.

1171
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,360
And second of all, he didn't even want to touch it again.

1172
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,360
Now me, I want as many guns as possible, but I would rather have a real gun than play a

1173
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,360
gun game.

1174
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,360
Oh God.

1175
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,360
Here's another one.

1176
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,360
This was on television.

1177
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,360
You ready for this one?

1178
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,160
This is some scary fucking shit from when you were a kid.

1179
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:34,120
SGA 100 Matt says, just show your kids Tim Curry as it and they will crap themselves.

1180
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,720
Actually his name was Pennywise the clown, but yes, same thing.

1181
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,720
Right?

1182
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,720
Remember that?

1183
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,720
That shit was fucking scary.

1184
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,720
That was.

1185
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,720
And that was on TV.

1186
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,720
That was an ABC.

1187
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,720
Or how many of us watched legend?

1188
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,360
There's actually a scene in that I can't watch ever.

1189
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,280
Anyway, we got to get past the kid scary stuff.

1190
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,120
I want to address from chat real quick.

1191
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:57,120
Somebody had asked, what has Leland Yee done besides the bill?

1192
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,460
So I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, just thumbing through some of the other things

1193
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:01,460
he's done.

1194
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:07,720
Uh, AB 1371 in 2003 strengthens informed consent requirements for mentally handicapped patients

1195
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,640
that take part in medical research.

1196
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:17,440
Uh, 2004 AB 2412 allows part-time community college faculty to access unemployment benefits.

1197
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,160
AB 3042 enhances sentences for child prostitution.

1198
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:28,600
Uh, let's see, 2006 AB 409 establishes tighter controls and higher health standards for nail

1199
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,600
salons.

1200
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:35,520
Uh, AB 1207 adds sexual orientation to the list of protections in the code of fair political

1201
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,520
practices.

1202
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,640
So, you know, he's not been all about, you know, take it or leave it with you.

1203
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,080
I don't know what there you agree with or what you don't agree with.

1204
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,320
There's been other stuff to him than just this violent video game law, which I think

1205
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:52,000
unfortunately he's making a, uh, a whole career defining thing out of.

1206
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,080
Just a heads up, he is running for mayor of San Francisco.

1207
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,080
You may or may not know.

1208
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:00,840
Uh, San Francisco, the former mayor Gavin Newsom, uh, is now the Lieutenant Governor

1209
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,000
of California after the November elections.

1210
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,440
Uh, so they have an interim mayor and that means there's going to be a new mayor election

1211
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,440
this year.

1212
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,920
So there are a handful of candidates in the ring and Leland Yee is one of them.

1213
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,240
So there you go.

1214
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,400
Unfortunately, maybe violent video games will be banned in San Francisco.

1215
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,400
Why not?

1216
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,200
They're banning Happy Meal toys and circumcision too on top of everything else.

1217
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,200
So why not?

1218
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,480
We'll just throw violent video games in there.

1219
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,480
Anyhow.

1220
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:32,160
Oh yeah, I guess I should get one other story here that I meant to mention.

1221
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:36,880
Uh, Utah, uh, Utah was going to be doing a similar type of thing.

1222
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:41,920
However, the rep, uh, Michael Morley that was trying to get the law passed in Utah said,

1223
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:48,040
uh, after the Supreme Court decision, quote, it's not on my radar to fight that fight.

1224
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:52,160
So I guess after the Supreme Court decision, he's decided there are better things to do.

1225
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,700
All right, let's move on.

1226
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,700
More news.

1227
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,700
Dark Sakura.

1228
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:00,180
I was still trying to find this one article that was talking about the greatest cartoons

1229
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:01,640
for traumatizing children.

1230
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,800
Um, but how about we talk about Zinga?

1231
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,760
Zinga has something that's pretty traumatic for children.

1232
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,760
Yes, it is.

1233
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,120
It has something very new.

1234
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:14,840
And I am actually going to quote this article because I like the way it's laid out.

1235
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,960
It's a new venture.

1236
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,840
It's something different from Farmville and Frontierville.

1237
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,440
So here's where the quote begins.

1238
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,240
One, it doesn't actually have Ville in the title.

1239
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,760
Two, players play with actual totally real money.

1240
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,720
Three, players companies won't necessarily grow.

1241
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,080
In fact, it may shrink through no fault of their own.

1242
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,080
Wait, wait.

1243
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,000
Players play with real money?

1244
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Mm-hmm.

1245
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,880
The company is Zinga and it's not a game but a stock offering.

1246
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,880
They're going public.

1247
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,480
Oh, I get it.

1248
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,040
They're going public.

1249
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:52,560
They are filling an S1 form and it's not going to be publicly traded.

1250
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,560
So you know what this means?

1251
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,560
We can really fuck them now.

1252
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:01,560
No, I think their stock's actually, they're expecting their stock to jump up in price

1253
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,400
quite a bit, so it might not be a bad buy.

1254
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:09,520
So, I mean, Zinga really, really relies on Facebook for a lot of their business.

1255
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,520
A lot.

1256
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,960
Like I know they're going to come out and say they don't need Facebook to survive, but

1257
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:13,960
they kind of do.

1258
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,680
Like Facebook put them on the map.

1259
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:21,440
Now with all this talk about the decline of people using Facebook, Google Plus is coming

1260
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,800
out and has people talking.

1261
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,360
I mean, you know, don't put it in the nail coffin of Facebook yet.

1262
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,200
Assuming that they let people in.

1263
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,320
But I'm just saying, you know, there is this talk about Facebook might be slipping a little

1264
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,320
bit.

1265
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,600
Like it's time for Zinga to say, trust in us.

1266
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:41,000
Like I really think I personally, I just kind of think Zinga needs to find a niche that

1267
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,940
isn't just Facebook games or isn't just a VIL game.

1268
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,120
Like I know you were kind of joking with the whole story about the stock market, but like

1269
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:52,640
it would be great for Zinga's profile if they could do a game that's not VIL.

1270
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,720
Now I'm sure somebody is going to bring up and okay, find the words.

1271
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,720
Farm villain.

1272
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,720
No, no.

1273
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,720
The words with friends.

1274
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,120
There actually is a Facebook game called Farm Villain and it's about like posting status

1275
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,080
updates to your wall that are fucked up shit.

1276
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:09,240
But anyway, there's the words with friends free and the, uh, hanging with friends on

1277
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:13,920
that they got from buying other developers basically, but you know, Zinga doesn't kind

1278
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:19,080
of yet have that thing that they're known for besides Facebook games.

1279
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,320
You know what I mean?

1280
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:27,340
So that and a very neutered dog on their logo.

1281
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,880
Where does that, doesn't that name have like a weird meaning to it too?

1282
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,640
I can't remember like where the company name came from or something silly.

1283
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,100
Islander says, I didn't know Zinga was on Facebook.

1284
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,320
I've just been playing on MySpace.

1285
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:43,080
Ladies and gentlemen, we have found the one person that is still on MySpace.

1286
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,240
I thought it was Tom.

1287
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,400
I thought it was Justin Timberlake, but go to chat right now.

1288
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,400
He's there.

1289
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,400
Zinga is the CEO's dog.

1290
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,320
Oh, that's why the logo is a dog.

1291
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,320
That makes sense.

1292
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,320
All right.

1293
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,320
Uh, let's see.

1294
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:59,200
By the way, we got a tweet about this tonight from a Twitter user, Nathan Jackson.

1295
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,440
I would like you all to talk about Zinga going public.

1296
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,280
Do you all think it would be sustainable with games like Farmville going down?

1297
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,880
Uh, kind of that same point I was just making like things are declining.

1298
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:14,920
So I think the only way Zinga can be successful is for them to show what else they have that

1299
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,040
isn't just Farmville and Facebook games.

1300
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,120
And I think this whole word with friends and stuff is a good place to start, but they have

1301
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:25,880
to be able to show that they can consistently be on top of these social or casual gaming

1302
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,880
trends if you will.

1303
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,840
I just hope to God it's not true that they tried to buy PopCap.

1304
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:36,260
That would be, that would make me very sad if Zinga and PopCap merged.

1305
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,260
Very sad.

1306
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:43,240
All right, moving on, let's get to some other news stories and release dates soon.

1307
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,640
Some more depressing news.

1308
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:53,020
If you thought, you know, the government trying to fine you for purchasing an adult game if

1309
01:07:53,020 --> 01:08:01,120
you're under the age was bad, well, Senate Bill S978 is gonna really get you going.

1310
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:07,540
It's gonna basically regulate a lot of stuff that's going on the internet, mainly streaming

1311
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:12,880
unauthorized copyrighted material, making it a felony that will result in up to five

1312
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,660
years of jail time if it's passed.

1313
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:20,920
Basically it says, the bill states that 10 or more public performances by electronic

1314
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:28,200
means during any 180 day period of one or more copyrighted works will result in not

1315
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,960
more than five years of imprisonment.

1316
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:37,760
So as long as the performance in question is valued at least $2500 US, or the value

1317
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:44,160
of the license to legally perform its content is valued at $5000 or more.

1318
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:49,120
And basically it's the same criteria that they allow right now for the DMCA takedown

1319
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,720
notices to be issued by copyright holders.

1320
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:57,160
However, jail time and felony status are not currently associated obviously with those,

1321
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:04,720
and now they're saying right now it says if it manages to pass.

1322
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,640
The homemade gameplay clips, which I've never heard of them called like this, but apparently

1323
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:17,980
referred to as let's play videos, fan made music videos, a webcam, cover songs, anything

1324
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:20,560
I guess that involves music or video.

1325
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:27,240
It could potentially cover cell phone videos of concerts and press events.

1326
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:35,420
So yeah, basically if they're saying that this could apply to YouTube users, and also

1327
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:43,360
sites that embed YouTube content as well, and really to get down to the bottom, I think

1328
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,680
they're gonna have a hard time regulating this stuff.

1329
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:52,240
I mean, if they're gonna go after everything, then, I don't know, and this is only gonna

1330
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,440
benefit what?

1331
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:58,400
I understand that you, for example, if you take a song off an album and you put it as

1332
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:04,840
a YouTube video and you leave it there so people can listen or pirate that song, I understand

1333
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,840
that's bad.

1334
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:12,320
If for example, and I don't even know about so much the music videos and stuff, I don't

1335
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,760
have a real big problem with that, especially gameplay videos, I don't understand gameplay

1336
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:25,540
at all because it's not really the same as like putting a movie up, like an actual cinematic

1337
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:30,320
movie and you're pirating or like a TV show or something like that.

1338
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,600
This law is absolute total utter bullshit, and the problem with it is that it's just

1339
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,160
shittily written.

1340
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,440
Is that a word I can use, shittily?

1341
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,440
It can be.

1342
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:48,840
Anyway, this law was shite, it is total utter shite, and the reason why it's shite, it's

1343
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,200
just badly written because it includes all this other stuff.

1344
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,000
I get what they're trying to do.

1345
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,800
What they're trying to do is they're trying to get at these websites where you can log

1346
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:02,940
in and you can stream movies that are in the theater, you can stream them, or current TV

1347
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:04,040
shows and all that.

1348
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,200
That's what they're doing, but because they've left the door so wide fucking open, if somebody

1349
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:12,780
gets on there and tapes a karaoke performance and puts it up on YouTube, it could be subject

1350
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,080
to this law.

1351
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,400
And you might be saying, well that's not what they're trying to go after, but unfortunately

1352
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:22,560
when you have a shittily written law, excuse me, a shite law like this, it leaves the door

1353
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,560
open for that.

1354
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:27,280
I mean, if you're saying that if this isn't what they're going to try to do with it, well

1355
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:32,520
yeah, sure, I'm sure that that one person downloading that one MP3 really costs that

1356
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,880
music company $100,000 for that one song.

1357
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,640
The problem is this is also, it's just taking a big fat dump all over fair use.

1358
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:46,640
Like I should be, yes, I should be able to upload video for the purpose of critiquing

1359
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,280
and commenting on it.

1360
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:52,320
So you mean I'm going to have to contact the copyright owner to get express permission

1361
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,320
to do that?

1362
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,320
Well guess what?

1363
01:11:54,320 --> 01:12:00,080
All of your game review videos are going to be done by IGN, 1UP, GameSpot, and all the

1364
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,200
big companies because Activision all those times, they don't have the time for little

1365
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,920
pissants like you and me that they're going to sign off on the rights for that.

1366
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,520
So say goodbye to independent media if something like this passes.

1367
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,520
You know what?

1368
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,200
Say goodbye to Orange Lounge Radio if this passes because I'm telling you, if this bill

1369
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:21,480
in its current form passes and goes effective, I'm walking away from the show because I am

1370
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:27,640
not going to go to jail because I like to play music over the classic game of the week

1371
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,720
for the purposes of critiquing it.

1372
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,720
That is not a threat.

1373
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,720
That is a promise.

1374
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:35,560
If the law passes and is enforced, there will not be Orange Lounge Radio anymore.

1375
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,560
Period.

1376
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,560
Well, I don't know.

1377
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,920
Maybe Loki and Dark Soccer will decide they want to do it, but somehow I don't think they

1378
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,440
want to subject themselves to that either.

1379
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:47,520
Like that is the seriousness of this bullshit law.

1380
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,320
I get what they're trying to do.

1381
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,640
They're not doing it right.

1382
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,760
So they need to, you need to contact your senator, contact folks and tell them that

1383
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:01,200
this law is a bad thing for America.

1384
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:06,000
Now just to let you know, there actually is a site up there that will generate email to

1385
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,660
your local legislature.

1386
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:12,520
So you do have a way of getting out there.

1387
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,560
Actually I have relinked it on my live, not my live channel, but my Facebook.

1388
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,080
And who is voting these goddamn people in the office?

1389
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,120
I mean, seriously, all these Lin Yee's and shit.

1390
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,880
Oh, and he's going to become mayor now because he's such full of wonderful ideas.

1391
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,880
That's great.

1392
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,680
Remember what I said about lazy Americans?

1393
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:37,280
The fact that people won't get up and vote when these things come up, just sit back and

1394
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,280
bitch about it.

1395
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,280
Sorry, you don't vote about it.

1396
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,280
You have no right to complain.

1397
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:44,440
Uh, Tiger Claw in our chat room says, yesterday I was on Justin TV and I did a search of Transformers

1398
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:48,200
and sure enough people were streaming a bootleg of Transformers 3 in a foreign language.

1399
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,200
Hahaha.

1400
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:54,660
Well then they, that needs to be worked out between Justin TV and the copyright owners

1401
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,080
of the work.

1402
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:00,400
And Justin TV should take action there thusly against those accounts of people doing it

1403
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,200
because I'm sure that is against their terms of service.

1404
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,600
Like that's the law you need.

1405
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,880
Not sending me to jail because I want to sing, uh, or I wouldn't, I want to post a tape of

1406
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,160
Jessica and I singing Love Shack on the internet.

1407
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,880
Actually I would never post that tape on the internet, but she did and I don't want her

1408
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,960
to go to jail for that.

1409
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:23,920
And, and, and on top of that, that would make certain games illegal because I believe like

1410
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:30,160
SingStar and stuff like that allows you to take songs and record videos to them and post

1411
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,160
them up on the internet.

1412
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,160
Correct.

1413
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:36,660
And also there's going to be a game like SingFour, um, the hits edition that's going to have

1414
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,440
connectivity with YouTube as well.

1415
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:43,240
So all those are basically felony makers.

1416
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:48,400
Unless of course those people that own those songs or, you know, own those video game companies

1417
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,960
and stuff like that.

1418
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:55,400
Don't stop these things from going, cause if no one complains, then you know, it's going

1419
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,400
to be all right.

1420
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,320
Black Wolf in our chat room says, well, to be fair, I don't know if the guy who wrote

1421
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:03,080
this bill campaigned on this, so they could have voted him in without knowing he was going

1422
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,840
to pen this specific bill.

1423
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,280
And that's a, that's a true point.

1424
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:10,280
You never know what politicians are going to do, but we need to hold them accountable.

1425
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:14,960
And I plan to write my Congress people and say, if you support this bill, I will not

1426
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,240
vote for you.

1427
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,640
I will not vote for you.

1428
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:22,920
What's it take to like, say for example, um, get these guys out of office, you know, there's

1429
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,160
these elections that they have every few years.

1430
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:30,040
Well, I understand that, but I'm, I, you know, Hey, we can recall, I guess that's what happened

1431
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:35,760
with governor or how governor Schwarzenegger got into office in the first place.

1432
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,600
So I can't remember the govern ater, that's where that all came from.

1433
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:44,000
He terminated the other governor and where that shit, you know, I think we ended up with

1434
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,620
the worst governor, but I don't want to make this show political.

1435
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:49,640
So anyhow, I'm too late for that.

1436
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,640
I know, right?

1437
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,560
Like I really didn't want, especially after last week where things got a little heated,

1438
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,840
like I really didn't want to have a political show tonight, but like we can't fucking get

1439
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,840
away from it.

1440
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:05,500
It's all that's in the news this week is all this political stuff.

1441
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,280
Let's move to another country.

1442
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,400
Let's make our own country.

1443
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,400
It's O.L.A.

1444
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:17,800
Uh, by the way, the Senator that's behind this is, uh, Amy Klobuchar, Klobuchar, Democrat

1445
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,480
from Minnesota and Minnesota.

1446
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,400
There's a whole website, open congress.org that will show you who's in favor of it and

1447
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,400
who's against it.

1448
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,720
Right now, 51 companies for it, three against.

1449
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,320
I'm telling you though, if it goes through, it's going to be yet another one of those

1450
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,520
laws that gets tied up because I, I would be fucking pissed cause this is just seems

1451
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,840
to violate fair use.

1452
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,400
Like really, I can't film somebody at karaoke?

1453
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,400
Like that is wrong.

1454
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,200
Well, and how, how more ridiculous is this going to go?

1455
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,680
I mean, on the bright side, American Idol will finally go off the air.

1456
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:52,400
It's like, um, say for example, you know, the happy birthday song.

1457
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,400
Is that public domain?

1458
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:57,800
I mean, is, are people going to get sued because there's a song playing in the background of

1459
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,440
like a YouTube video or something like that?

1460
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:09,640
Quoting videos, well, you know, Leland, you at least one quote, you know, he's talking

1461
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:13,480
about different, you know, stuff, you know, pandering towards corporations.

1462
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:17,160
I think this is one of those things that panders towards a corporation, not necessarily the

1463
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,960
one that you're quoting.

1464
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,080
Um, when he made that comment, but there are definitely a lot of bills and stuff that go

1465
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,840
towards these corporations that have these senators in their pockets.

1466
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,320
So I don't know.

1467
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,960
It's not, not much of a surprise.

1468
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,680
Just so you guys know, here's some of the organizations that are supporting this bill.

1469
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,720
The Directors Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild, the Motion Picture Association

1470
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:43,840
of America, Recording Industry Association of America, NBCUniversal, Viacom, Sony Pictures

1471
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:51,320
Entertainment, Ultimate Fighting Championship, uh, Church Music Publishers Association.

1472
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,760
Well, we're fucked.

1473
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,280
Church Music Publishers Association.

1474
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:59,000
It's all the RAA and MPAA and all the different movies to use because no one wants piracy.

1475
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,720
But you know what, that I understand, hey, no, I have no problem with them fighting piracy.

1476
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:11,200
I get the, yeah, the, the, the reason this bill is going into place, I get it.

1477
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,640
This bill doesn't cut it.

1478
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,880
You need to close these loopholes in the bill before it, and basically what is going to

1479
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:25,000
stop every website in Canada and other countries like I, this is another reason, oh, I promised

1480
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,560
I wouldn't get political, but I can't.

1481
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,120
This is another reason I can't keep supporting these bills that try to regulate the internet

1482
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,440
in America.

1483
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:37,400
You idiots, America does not rule the world, contrary to what everybody seems to think

1484
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,040
sometimes here.

1485
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,040
You can't stop the rest of the world.

1486
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,480
Hey, well, at least we can still stream in Canada.

1487
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:46,000
It will all go to China.

1488
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,440
Look at the story we started off with tonight.

1489
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,160
Where did the rampant piracy come from?

1490
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:54,800
Where did Ask Cree Bro come from?

1491
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,120
China.

1492
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:01,440
So all the fine Orange Lawn's radio is moving to China.

1493
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:06,080
If this bill goes through, at least we can do our show from there.

1494
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,680
I'd rather live in Taiwan.

1495
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:13,000
We can still stream it, you know, stream to Canada and I can play all the Assassin's Creed

1496
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
brotherhood.

1497
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,160
We don't have to say where we're located.

1498
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:21,160
We're in Canadian and not in the U S I'm not Benji in our chat room says actually happy

1499
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,500
birthday is copyrighted.

1500
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,500
That's right.

1501
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:27,120
So if you put up a YouTube singing happy birthday to someone, you're going to be, your ass is

1502
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,400
going to jail for, I would love to see that article.

1503
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,140
Grandma goes is, you know, okay.

1504
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:38,080
What happens if you know, you make do three different songs, we'd be singing like happy

1505
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:43,560
birthday and then a couple of other karaoke songs and that's three strikes or three, no,

1506
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,560
that's not three strikes.

1507
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:51,000
It's major like a violent felonies I think, but DJ Morpheus in the chat room, our good

1508
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,720
buddy from under sedation live Saturday nights here at all games, but not to worry.

1509
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,200
This is going through Congress.

1510
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,800
So the public will have a voice and courts to fight it.

1511
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,960
Unlike carp, which was all secretly done behind closed doors.

1512
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:09,000
Well, God damn sir, I hope you are right because three words, this bill sucks.

1513
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Fucking sucks.

1514
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Four words.

1515
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
All right.

1516
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,560
And this is really more important than, you know, balancing a budget.

1517
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,220
Dark Ted Sousa says, well, we're still waiting to see if under station live will be banned

1518
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:22,220
in China.

1519
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:25,020
It'll, it'll be a great little thing for the network.

1520
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:29,000
It'll be like the show from China versus the show that can't be in China.

1521
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
All on one network.

1522
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,560
He said all games.com will also have to move to China or Canada.

1523
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:38,040
Where can all games.com go if this bill passes all games.com?

1524
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,440
What country would we put them in?

1525
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,920
Where would Scott Rubin want to be?

1526
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:50,320
They can go to, uh, where would Scott Amsterdam, no, no, there's no football there.

1527
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,960
Oh shit.

1528
01:20:52,960 --> 01:21:01,280
Football, but not, well then I guess they could do Canadian football in Canada.

1529
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,280
All right.

1530
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,160
Moving on.

1531
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,640
This bill is, uh, it's taking far too much time on our show, but at the same time it

1532
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:08,800
is very important.

1533
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,120
And so, uh, we just want to bring your attention to it.

1534
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:17,180
Like I'm not fucking around if this bill passes, say goodbye to a lot of your favorite gaming

1535
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,180
press stuff.

1536
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:21,120
This, this is bad for the gaming industry.

1537
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,080
This is bad for the gaming industry.

1538
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,680
And if they don't see it, they're morons.

1539
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,800
It's impotent.

1540
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:32,880
Speaking of morons, Nintendo of America updated their Facebook page on Sunday, promising that

1541
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,440
they would give more updates soon regarding some of the petitions that have been going

1542
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,440
around.

1543
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,440
We talked about this last week on the show.

1544
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:42,520
I think dark soccer brought up how fans were petitioning for releases of Xenoblade, the

1545
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:48,480
last story in Pandora's tower here in the U S uh, it was called operation rainfall.

1546
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:52,920
Well on, uh, let's see Tuesday, I think was the day it was finally posted.

1547
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,880
They finally posted a response.

1548
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,400
Fans have been waiting for this quote.

1549
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:02,100
We never say never, but we can confirm that there are no plans to bring these three games

1550
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,960
to the Americas at this time.

1551
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:10,200
The Twitter response thanked operation rainfall folks for being such incredible fans, but

1552
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:15,000
said there continues to be no plans for Nintendo of America to release these three games right

1553
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
now.

1554
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,520
So I see, I haven't seen people rally for a Wii games release in a very long time, not

1555
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:26,440
since president cat have fans rallied for a Wii game to be released, which by the way,

1556
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:31,520
I don't know if you guys saw this, but a destructor had an article this week because of all this

1557
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,320
about the 10 great Wii games that should have been released that folks are campaigning for

1558
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,680
that never were president cat made the list.

1559
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:43,140
So our little campaign was not forgotten, which I think is great.

1560
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:47,400
And they actually said the game is called president cat people, which made me laugh

1561
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,360
because the game actually wasn't called president cat.

1562
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,200
We kind of gave it that name because the translation was like boss cat.

1563
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,960
And so I don't know, it just kind of came out, let's call it president cat.

1564
01:22:55,960 --> 01:23:03,440
Well, the, the definition of a Sukeban is like a delinquent gang leader girl.

1565
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:08,640
So if you imagine a cat being like a delinquent gang leader who was also the president of

1566
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,120
the company, yes, then that's what it's like.

1567
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,920
Gang banger cat.

1568
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,360
That can be the sequel.

1569
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,560
All right.

1570
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,840
Um, geez.

1571
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:27,600
Anyhow by the way, Xenoblade is still getting a localization for an English speaking country

1572
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:34,580
and then some, uh, there is a European localization in the works and uh, this is for Xenoblade

1573
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:38,120
Chronicles and it was in an Iwata Asks interview.

1574
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:40,120
That's a little video clip there.

1575
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:43,080
And uh, Xenoblade is coming out in Europe on September 2nd.

1576
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,800
It's going to come out with a red classic controller pro in order to, to localize a

1577
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:48,800
game for Europe.

1578
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:54,280
I think it's gotta be an English, French, Spanish, German, and I'm forgetting a language,

1579
01:23:54,280 --> 01:24:00,920
but like there's like five languages, Swahili, probably English, French, Spanish, probably

1580
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:01,920
Italian.

1581
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,600
That's like five different languages.

1582
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:08,380
The game's got to be in to come out over there and uh, she just do it in Latin yet.

1583
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:11,260
It's not worth the money to put out here.

1584
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:16,280
It would take no money, I mean, no additional money to bring it over here, seeing as they're

1585
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,280
already doing the translation.

1586
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,640
Well at least I could go on eBay and get a bootleg of it from China, at least you'll

1587
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,640
get that.

1588
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,640
At least.

1589
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:27,360
I'm of course, you know, their comment on Twitter was, you know, that in fact, Operation

1590
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:32,320
Rainfall, someone retweeted that and they made the comment of, they basically retweeted

1591
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:37,440
what Nintendo said, to which I put dot dot dot, instead we have some more Nintendo 64

1592
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,720
games we'd like to port over and make zero changes and Zelda you had a premium.

1593
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,280
Love Nintendo.

1594
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:49,840
Exactly, Zelda, Zelda Ocarina of Time in 3D, not a problem, Xenoblade, fuck you.

1595
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,840
That's what I'm hearing.

1596
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,800
But hey, you know what though?

1597
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,600
Nintendo's gonna be, you don't understand, here's how Nintendo's gonna fucking play this

1598
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,600
shit off.

1599
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:03,120
Well we have no plans on doing that right now, but come E3, fans demanded it, and Nintendo,

1600
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:07,360
we hear you fans, we're gonna bring it out for you because we're so gracious, we're gonna

1601
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,000
bring them out to you.

1602
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,360
It's basically, you're gonna beg for it, and then they're gonna say no, and they're like,

1603
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,800
ah, well we're so gracious, we're gonna bring it out to you.

1604
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,800
So you know what?

1605
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,480
When they do that, don't fucking buy it.

1606
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,480
Tell them, fuck you.

1607
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,640
Wait, but why wouldn't you?

1608
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:24,720
If they finally do decide to release the game, isn't that what you wanted?

1609
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:28,360
Because it's the attitude that they're having with it?

1610
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,480
I don't know if I meet you all the way, they're like, I don't disagree that something like

1611
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:37,320
that is very likely to happen, but I had said before the show, I said, watch, because Nintendo

1612
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:42,040
likes to kind of take games and redo them for new consoles, like, these will all be

1613
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:46,080
games on the Wii U, and they'll be able to say that, oh, we're listening, oh, these are

1614
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:51,360
games that the hardcore gamers want, Last Story Plus Edition on the Wii U, it's Last

1615
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,400
Story U, and Xenoblade U.

1616
01:25:53,400 --> 01:26:00,120
No, it's not gonna be that at all, because that would take additional effort.

1617
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,400
They're not gonna put in additional effort.

1618
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,760
I don't even understand what the point is, because like, they've had other games that

1619
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:10,240
they have translated the English and released only in Europe and Japan, and never brought

1620
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:16,400
the Europe version of the game over here, which, I mean, I would think if you're spending

1621
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,480
the money to translate in the English, why not release it over here?

1622
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:23,500
Hell, you don't have to fucking advertise this thing very much, just put it out.

1623
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:28,420
You will sell some copies of it, especially something that people are demanding that be

1624
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,420
brought over here.

1625
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:32,640
Of course, their thought is probably, oh, well, this is such a niche game that no one's

1626
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:36,840
gonna really buy it, but then at the same time, I think, well, let's see, you put out

1627
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:42,160
Mr. Case Files, the Malgrave incident, no one really gives a shit about that.

1628
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:45,280
That one just went poof, like, no one even knew that came out.

1629
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:50,000
If we had not mentioned that it came out, no one would fucking know that the game came

1630
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,520
out.

1631
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,920
It's a bummer that it's the Wii, because if this was the 360 and there wasn't enough fan

1632
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,840
demand, we've seen now where that game, and I forget what it was, Death Smile or whatever,

1633
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:07,280
was that Japanese shooter game that came out in Japan, and they just said, you know what,

1634
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,880
we'll put it up as a download title, we're not gonna bother to translate it, though,

1635
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:15,460
so fucking, here it is, just take it, if you want it, but I think people are generally

1636
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:16,460
happy with that.

1637
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:19,460
And now there are special box sets and everything.

1638
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:24,280
So unfortunately, it would be great if the Wii could support that, but it can't.

1639
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,280
And on top of that.

1640
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:29,680
Maybe the Wii, maybe the punchline is the Wii U will, and these games will be downloadable

1641
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,680
on the Wii U.

1642
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,080
And here's the funny part about that.

1643
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,520
On top of the fact that they won't even bring it over here, they give Europe a nice collector's

1644
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,400
edition with a controller and everything for them.

1645
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:43,560
So obviously they know that the game's popular, but they just still don't give a fuck about

1646
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,560
you.

1647
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,880
Rickster in our chatroom says, why do that?

1648
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:48,120
Nintendo has already put the Wii out to pasture.

1649
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,760
And I think that's a good point, is, you know, well, they've already said the Wii U's coming,

1650
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,200
so let the Wii die, basically a slow death as we get our last little hurrah Zelda game

1651
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,200
this holiday.

1652
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:01,160
The Wii U's and people, and this Wii U isn't coming out until the end of next year, so

1653
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,280
what the fuck are they going to put out?

1654
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,840
Is everybody planning on buying a Wii U day one?

1655
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:07,840
No!

1656
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,640
If I've learned one thing from Nintendo consoles, no I'm not.

1657
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:14,560
I'm not planning on buying this thing day one, I mean, unless there's that just kick-ass

1658
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,680
must-have game, we'll wait and see.

1659
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:21,560
I am a consumer whore though, so I still may succumb to needing it earlier or something

1660
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:26,880
like that, but it really so far hasn't, I mean it's basically a Wii with better graphics

1661
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:31,200
and a stupid controller that I don't really give two shits about.

1662
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,200
But...

1663
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:37,480
But I'm just gonna like, well, when the PlayStation 3 came out, the PlayStation 2 didn't just

1664
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,480
roll over and die.

1665
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,480
No, it still has it.

1666
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:45,400
God of War was still going, and the old systems don't just roll over and die.

1667
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,400
So I think these games...

1668
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:50,200
Especially not the Wii, because you have to understand, just because everyone bought a

1669
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,840
Wii does not mean they're going to buy a Wii U.

1670
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:56,320
In fact, I think because you got all these old people and stuff like that to buy Wii's,

1671
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,320
no!

1672
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:02,320
That is not going to translate into more Wii U sales, just because you can use these Wii

1673
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,320
games on there.

1674
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,320
I mean, think about it.

1675
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:08,160
It's like, Rob, I need to buy a Blu-ray player, but hey, it's okay, because I can still play

1676
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:09,440
my DVDs on it.

1677
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:13,080
Well, why am I going to buy a new unit if I already have something that plays DVDs?

1678
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,440
It doesn't make any sense.

1679
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,440
I gotta say this.

1680
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,880
I'm not the only one that doesn't understand your perspective, Loki, of campaign to get

1681
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,520
the games out, and then when they come out, say fuck them because of their bad attitude.

1682
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:26,520
Derek H. in our chat room says, wait, so you'd be upset if they do what you want them to

1683
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,520
do?

1684
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,760
That's like going to McDonald's, buying a Happy Meal, then throwing it on the ground

1685
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:34,240
yelling, fuck you, Ronald McDonald!

1686
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:38,080
The sad thing is, I can see Loki doing that!

1687
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,000
There isn't enough fucking bacon!

1688
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:46,780
No, it's my problem is, how else then do you teach a company like this that you're not

1689
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:48,080
going to fucking take their...

1690
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,080
Oh, well, if you're big...

1691
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:52,560
Well, if you're going to just have to take Reggie and bend him over your knee and say

1692
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,560
you're being very, very...

1693
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:57,280
And it's just like, it's like fucking Konami, you know, with, well, if you really want this

1694
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:00,080
game to come out, you better have those pre-orders in!

1695
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:03,520
I mean, fuck you, I'm not buying your goddamn game then.

1696
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,040
I don't give a shit if you put it out, because it will probably suck anyways, because all

1697
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:11,480
of your games, you know, especially music games, they have really blown.

1698
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:15,720
I like doing the pre-orders to determine things, because that's how we got the low cost on

1699
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,000
the Macross box sets.

1700
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,280
I like how the random-ass DDR, just, we can never get away from that.

1701
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,280
Alright.

1702
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,000
Well, no, it's because they pulled that bullshit.

1703
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Hey, Capcom!

1704
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,400
Why don't you step up and do this bullshit, because, you know, this seems perfectly down

1705
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:28,400
your alley.

1706
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,400
Is that what Nintendo should do?

1707
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,640
Should Nintendo put it up on their website and say, okay, if 10,000 people order Xenoblade,

1708
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,560
then we'll put it out?

1709
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,840
If that's what it's going to take for them to do it in a timely manner, then fine.

1710
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:38,840
Would you do it?

1711
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,280
No, because I don't want to buy this fucking game.

1712
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:46,200
I don't play the Wii anymore, who do I care?

1713
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,080
Fuck you, Ronald McDonald!

1714
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:52,120
No, I would seriously, I would boycott the game then.

1715
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,600
Oh, well, you don't want to bring it out?

1716
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,160
Fine, you just want to put out some more Mario and Kirby games.

1717
01:30:56,160 --> 01:31:00,160
Kirby, which, by the way, I don't know if anyone still cares about Kirby, but...

1718
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:04,280
This is like the opposite of Operation Rainfall.

1719
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,240
This is Operation Thunder Snow.

1720
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:09,840
Yo, fuck those games!

1721
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:14,480
I think you should start a campaign on Twitter, Operation Thunder Snow.

1722
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,600
Don't release those games.

1723
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,440
In fact, don't buy Wii games.

1724
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:21,880
P.S., fuck you, Ronald McDonald.

1725
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,880
No, seriously, okay, let's see you...

1726
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:29,880
Everyone's going to get a fucking raging boner over a goddamn, you know, Skyward Sword.

1727
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:34,080
Ooh, it's a Zelda game with stuff in it, I mean...

1728
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:39,700
I gotta say, though, the last story looked fucking great, and I was looking forward to

1729
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:42,360
seeing that announcement in E3, and would I have bought that on the Wii?

1730
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,120
Actually, yes, I think I would have.

1731
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,120
Where are the reviews in Japan?

1732
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:50,040
I have one of those boners for Mistwalker that I kind of do for Q Entertainment.

1733
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:53,560
Like, even their mediocre games I will still support, like Blue Dragon.

1734
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,240
Hey, Mistwalker, guess what?

1735
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:59,720
Just because you had Nintendo publish your game in fucking Japan, you know what?

1736
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:01,320
Other companies will fucking publish it over here.

1737
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:04,220
You don't even have to go through all this bullshit of having to beg a company to bring

1738
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:05,220
it out.

1739
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:06,220
Because guess what?

1740
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,560
There's companies like Ignition that have said, hey, you know what?

1741
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,600
We're going to try our own internal game development, but that went up in smoke, so we're going

1742
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,880
to go and shop games that people want to be brought over here, and we're going to bring

1743
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:16,880
them over here.

1744
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,880
Or there's a company called Axis Game Localization.

1745
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,440
They localize games!

1746
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,360
That's all they fucking do is localize games!

1747
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:30,240
They bring over shit like BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2, and shit like that Guilty Gear that

1748
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:35,640
you would never, ever fucking play if, you know, you relied on Nintendo to bring that

1749
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,640
shit.

1750
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,580
Do you know how many decibels I've taken down your mic this episode and it's still

1751
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:40,480
not enough because you keep getting louder?

1752
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:43,800
Sorry, I'm just saying that you're just passionate.

1753
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,800
I am.

1754
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,800
I'm seriously passionate about it.

1755
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:50,640
The fact is, I don't think that it should result in people begging a company like Nintendo

1756
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:53,180
to try to get them to understand the niche market.

1757
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:56,520
You need companies that already understand the niche market and will bring this shit

1758
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,720
over regardless.

1759
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,560
Let me let me ask this and then we can move on with more stories because we're an hour

1760
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,520
and a half into the show and haven't got to the end of party yet.

1761
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,100
What is your passion?

1762
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:09,920
My passion as far as these games go.

1763
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,680
Why do these stories get you so angry?

1764
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:19,400
Because it's this whole, oh, we're this big company and we're just, you know, you should

1765
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,400
be gracious for everything they were putting out.

1766
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:25,760
And they just don't, they think they understand what their users want and they don't.

1767
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:30,500
I mean, their whole focus on, oh, let's, you know, make sure that we're putting out games

1768
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:36,240
that families want to play and elderly people want to play so we can sell lots of Wii systems

1769
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:40,360
and then they get all these systems out and it's like, hey, there's some really good games

1770
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:44,760
that, you know, kind of go towards the niche market of say people are like, you know, Japanese

1771
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:49,080
role playing games, something that's really been underrepresented on the Wii system.

1772
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:53,280
And we could bring this stuff over because we know we're doing the translation for Europe

1773
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:58,500
because, hey, they're a smaller market and I guess that makes it worth translating the

1774
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,400
game for it.

1775
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:04,120
We could bring this over here with little effort whatsoever, but no, we're going to

1776
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,200
be assholes and say basically, no, we don't.

1777
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,520
We don't have any plans on doing this and yeah, I know that you guys all rallied and

1778
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:13,920
really want this stuff over here and have committed to really going to buy this stuff,

1779
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,880
but you know what we're going to do and say we're going to put out another Kirby game

1780
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:23,120
or maybe another, you know, Mario basketball game or some bullshit like that because we

1781
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:28,020
know that Mario will sell and it requires very little effort on our part and really

1782
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:31,340
that's what we want to do is spend the least amount of effort possible.

1783
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:36,600
DJ Morpheus in our time says Loki needs Prozac flavored bacon.

1784
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,840
I really want bacon flavored like medicine.

1785
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,840
That's disgusting.

1786
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,960
Why would you want to flavor bacon?

1787
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:44,320
I think you meant bacon flavored Prozac.

1788
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,280
All right.

1789
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,040
Skye is Loki turning green yet?

1790
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,040
Nope.

1791
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,040
Still as white as you can believe.

1792
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,920
All right, let's move on with another news story and then we'll get into the release

1793
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:54,920
dates.

1794
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:55,920
Dark Sakura.

1795
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:56,920
Oh, Nintendo.

1796
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:02,460
You've been a very quiet lady over there and usually you're the opinionated one.

1797
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:05,360
So I've got to know what is your thought on all this mess?

1798
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,480
Like Nintendo not releasing these.

1799
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:08,480
Are they being hard-headed?

1800
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:11,280
Is does it make good business sense?

1801
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:14,180
I say it's average for Nintendo.

1802
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,360
This is just par for the course.

1803
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,640
I'm used to this shit.

1804
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:20,200
This is why you've just become desensitized to this.

1805
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,200
Pretty much.

1806
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:24,480
It's basically people- And not like I play my Wii anymore.

1807
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,760
Nintendo does something wrong.

1808
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,560
Nikki yells and screams about it, lather, rinse, repeat for the past nine years.

1809
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:32,960
It's basically, people are, they're barking up the wrong tree.

1810
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,160
They're asking Nintendo to bring over this really niche game when they should really

1811
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:41,200
be bugging these other publishers that put stuff out on the Wii as well as other systems

1812
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,520
to bring over the games.

1813
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:46,640
Because I think these people like, you know, like Atlas, there's another perfect example

1814
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,080
of a company that would do this.

1815
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,000
They, that's all they deal with is niche shit.

1816
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
All right, we get it.

1817
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
We need the return of working designs.

1818
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,120
You know, I actually, one of our pinball tables belongs to the owner of working designs.

1819
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,120
Oh really?

1820
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,120
Our Twilight Zone.

1821
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,120
That's kind of rad actually.

1822
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,120
That's how we got our Goemon doll.

1823
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:05,120
All right, let's move on.

1824
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,120
More gaming news.

1825
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,800
And uh, oh god, it's another Nintendo story, isn't it?

1826
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:13,600
Yeah, I'll- Oh god, get your earmuffs!

1827
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:22,400
Nintendo plans on spending 16.5 billion yen on a new research and design facility in Kyoto.

1828
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:28,000
This was reported by Miike, which is the Japanese stock market, that they're going to start

1829
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,840
building in January 2012 and will be finished by the end of 2013.

1830
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:40,180
And they have had this in the works since 2009, but the original price they had on it

1831
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:43,960
was 12 billion yen.

1832
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:49,000
They basically are trying to move everything into one house.

1833
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:56,000
They are bringing in their R&D offices, all of the main staff.

1834
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,640
Everything is going to be under one roof.

1835
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:06,400
So Loki, 16.5 billion yen on a new research and design facility, yet no last story.

1836
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,400
What are your thoughts?

1837
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:10,920
Maybe that's why I spent all this money on a new building.

1838
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:15,160
Well they want to put everyone under one roof, I don't see a problem with that.

1839
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:16,160
Apple's doing the same thing.

1840
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,320
They're building some giant space saucer thing.

1841
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:22,400
They're building a metal donut in the middle of San Jose.

1842
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:27,040
There's no square wall in the building or something like that.

1843
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:31,760
They actually wanted to make a building that looks like Steve Job's asshole.

1844
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:35,200
That's what they're building in the middle of San Jose.

1845
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:38,640
So everybody can literally walk up his ass day in and day out.

1846
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:42,160
And it's going to be all made of glass.

1847
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,560
I can actually point out something.

1848
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:48,560
There is a psychological reason that you want to remove hard edges is that it reduces the

1849
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,880
urge for violence.

1850
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:53,480
Oh, because when I think of Apple products, I think of violence.

1851
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:55,200
Loki, maybe.

1852
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,960
Maybe it's to make happier workers.

1853
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,440
Wow, really?

1854
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:03,920
I know people that would kill someone, literally kill someone in the dead of night to get a

1855
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:04,920
job at Apple.

1856
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:07,480
Like, I don't think of Apple as having angry workers.

1857
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:12,480
I wouldn't do that, no.

1858
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:19,800
The whole, like, fact that, you know, it's been shown that circle buildings or whatever

1859
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,760
cause people not to be violent.

1860
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,920
Sounds like the hippie mumbo jumbo that Steve Jobs would be spouting anyways.

1861
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,920
But you know what?

1862
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:27,920
Hectagons piss me off.

1863
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:33,840
No, I think the whole thing is that he didn't like being called a square.

1864
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:34,840
So that's why.

1865
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:35,840
So, ha!

1866
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:36,840
You can't call me a square now.

1867
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:37,840
You're a fucking idiot.

1868
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:38,840
And a hippie.

1869
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,960
We're going to plant some trees.

1870
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:42,960
Go plant some trees, Steve.

1871
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,200
Well, actually, we're going to plant a lot of trees.

1872
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,600
Don't need to prove me right anymore.

1873
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,840
I like how Loki had a wide open door to do more Nintendo bashing and he decided to take

1874
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:52,840
a pass.

1875
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:53,840
He just...

1876
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,440
What am I going to say about Nintendo opening a facility?

1877
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,440
Good for them.

1878
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,440
They're opening a building.

1879
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:01,040
It's not like this facility is going to research more Mario games.

1880
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:02,920
I mean, I don't know.

1881
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:03,920
I was...

1882
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:04,920
It's just...

1883
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:05,920
They're consolidating their stuff.

1884
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,080
Let me get you a little platter and I'm going to hand you the joke on the platter, okay?

1885
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,080
Here it is.

1886
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:12,080
Look at this.

1887
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,080
They're building a...

1888
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:17,120
They're putting all these billions of dollars into a research facility for all those new

1889
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,000
franchises they put out.

1890
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,700
There you go, Loki.

1891
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:21,700
It's not...

1892
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:23,100
Hey, you know what?

1893
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:26,040
I don't believe they research shit for any of their franchises.

1894
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,960
So that's obviously not what it's for.

1895
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:31,520
It's for their new consoles that are so innovative and different from their last console.

1896
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:35,840
In fact, this new console, what, it has a tablet for a controller.

1897
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,160
That's such a genius idea that they need a new research facility.

1898
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:45,400
Certainly an idea like that only could have come out of a building shaved like a donut.

1899
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:50,600
Basically quite a number of articles I just randomly found from anthropologists, different

1900
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:55,300
biologists, psychologists, all pointing to the...

1901
01:39:55,300 --> 01:40:01,000
By the circle is a comforting and familiar shape to the mind on an unconscious level.

1902
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I understand that.

1903
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:10,720
Well, as in art, we study the golden mean as a curve, so that it's like the shape of

1904
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:18,720
a shell, the circular shape of a shell, why a more circular face in some cultures is considered

1905
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,720
to be more attractive.

1906
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:22,480
They look for symmetry.

1907
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,520
The hecticons are still very rude, right?

1908
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,040
Yes, they are.

1909
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:30,440
So for the record, there actually is psychology behind it.

1910
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,480
I don't believe in psychology.

1911
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:38,560
That's clear.

1912
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,640
There's that witty retort I've been waiting for all night.

1913
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,480
All right, let's move on to release dates.

1914
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,360
We're going to travel the world and check out what's coming out to a store near you

1915
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,600
and eventually we'll get through this show.

1916
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:54,520
Loki, I'll save yourself some time because there's only one thing that's coming out this

1917
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:59,160
week that you really need to pick up and that would be Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.

1918
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:06,280
And that's, of course, assuming that they didn't release it on Saturday wherever you

1919
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:07,920
live, because that was the case.

1920
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:11,280
In fact, since we're getting into it now, I will explain why it's being released on

1921
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:16,840
Saturday because it's a funny story, actually, and it also goes to show you GameStop.

1922
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,240
They're fucking assholes.

1923
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,600
Okay, so get this.

1924
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:23,040
D3, they put out the game.

1925
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,920
They shipped it to stores or whatever like that early and stuff like that.

1926
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:32,960
They misprinted the street date number on the master cases that went out.

1927
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,900
So it said, Streets July 2nd, despite the fact that all their paperwork, the street

1928
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:39,240
date letters, et cetera, say July 5th.

1929
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:42,320
GameStop's going, no taking backsies, no taking backsies.

1930
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,400
It fucking says the second.

1931
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:47,780
We're putting it on the second on all systems, even though it was only the 360 master cases

1932
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:50,520
that they messed up on.

1933
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:55,880
Instead of D3 saying, hey, GameStop, I understand that we did misprint that on there.

1934
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:57,920
But the street date is still the fifth.

1935
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:58,920
Could you put it on the fifth?

1936
01:41:58,920 --> 01:41:59,920
They're like, fuck you.

1937
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,080
We're putting it out whenever we goddamn feel like it.

1938
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,800
And so that's kind of what happened.

1939
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:04,800
And because...

1940
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,800
Pinchpoke, you owe me a Coke.

1941
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,120
No take backsies.

1942
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:13,200
It's basically now everybody's kind of putting it out because, well, GameStop's doing it.

1943
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,840
And they advertise it on the website.

1944
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,840
They call it all their pre-order customers.

1945
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:17,840
They're assholes.

1946
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,320
But hey, you know what?

1947
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:23,120
The benefit of it is that you get to play the game early.

1948
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:26,440
And a lot of people are going to be putting it out as well other than GameStop early.

1949
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:31,120
So you know, bug killing on the 4th of July doesn't sound too bad.

1950
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:34,320
So the moral of the story is D3, learn to type.

1951
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,320
Yes.

1952
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:40,200
And that's coming out on PS3 and 360 this week.

1953
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:44,780
And I kid you not, that's literally the only thing that's coming out this week.

1954
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:47,880
Let's go to Japan and look at the releases there coming out in Japan this week.

1955
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,240
Also their own version of Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon comes out this week on the

1956
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,120
360 as well as Knight's Contract.

1957
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:55,520
L.A. Noire finally gets a release this week on the 360.

1958
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:58,320
I'm not sure how localized that game is for Japan.

1959
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:02,520
I imagine for it to have come out this fast, it's probably just subtitles and not full

1960
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,400
redone stuff, especially with all the actors and stuff.

1961
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:05,400
It's probably subtitles.

1962
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:07,240
I'm going to just guess on that.

1963
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:11,800
On the PlayStation 3, Angel Senki comes out as well as Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.

1964
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:14,200
Infamous 2 gets its Japanese release this week.

1965
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,880
Just Cause 2 gets a price reduction.

1966
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:21,800
Knight's Contract, L.A. Noire, a game called R.U.S.E. moves into the Ubisoft best collection,

1967
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,600
Tom Clancy's Hawks 2.

1968
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:26,600
Also a best collection price reduction this week on the PS3.

1969
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:29,480
It's a busy week on the PlayStation 3.

1970
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:34,920
Moving on to other consoles, let's see if I can get to the Wii or the 3DS here, my list.

1971
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:41,960
Oh, my list is starting to show Vita releases, but not until December over in Japan.

1972
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:42,960
No hard dates yet.

1973
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:45,200
I think those are all placeholders, just so you know.

1974
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:50,560
Sony PSP, Suzumiya Haruichan no Mahjong.

1975
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:53,640
They're doing a Haruhi Mahjong game?

1976
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:56,160
Yeah, look at that, right there.

1977
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,160
Check that out.

1978
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:58,160
I play it.

1979
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,160
And it's Mahjong.

1980
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,160
There you go.

1981
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:03,200
I don't know how to play Mahjong, you should teach me.

1982
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,520
You've never played Mahjong?

1983
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:09,640
Okay, I played Shanghai on the old Macintosh, I don't think that counts.

1984
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:10,640
That's Mahjong Solitaire.

1985
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:13,400
I'm talking about, like, for real, Mahjong.

1986
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:14,400
Oh, okay.

1987
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,400
All right.

1988
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:20,400
Tekken 6 gets a price reduction this week on the PSP.

1989
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:24,680
Let's see, the Nintendo Wii, a red Wii remote plus control.

1990
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:26,800
That's all that's coming out on the Wii this week.

1991
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:34,520
But 3DS gets a couple games, Dr. Lotrek Toboyaku no Kishidan comes out from Konami.

1992
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:35,920
This is...

1993
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:39,680
It's Dr. Lork in the, I don't remember the fucking subtitle to it.

1994
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,680
Okay, so it's that game.

1995
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,080
It's from Konami, it's coming out in September.

1996
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,280
So it's not Professor Layton.

1997
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:48,320
It's very similar to Professor Layton, but it's not.

1998
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,360
Next week, by the way, in Japan, you can look forward to this, not this week, next week,

1999
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:57,400
the 14th, the Flare Red 3DS and Star Fox 64 are the big releases in Japan next week.

2000
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:59,280
UK.

2001
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:05,080
One thing Virtua Tennis 4 on the 8th for PC.

2002
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,080
That's it.

2003
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,080
Oh, hooray.

2004
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:08,080
I love tennis.

2005
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,080
Moving on.

2006
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:11,280
Who plays tennis on the PC?

2007
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:15,160
Couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're gonna get to the classic game of

2008
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:16,160
the week.

2009
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:19,360
And I'll tell you what, this week's classic game of the week is old.

2010
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,760
No, really old, you guys.

2011
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:22,760
Yeah, it is.

2012
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:23,760
All right.

2013
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:24,760
Loki.

2014
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:30,320
Um, game for Windows, well, at least the marketplace is gonna be no longer, is actually merging

2015
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:35,000
with Xbox.com on July 11th.

2016
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,760
And that's all you need to know, I guess.

2017
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:44,840
They tried to overhaul it back in November, and no one cared.

2018
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:47,440
So now it's gonna be part of the Xbox marketplace.

2019
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,800
Awesome.

2020
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,440
This actually kind of makes sense.

2021
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:54,440
I mean, games for Windows was having a hard time kind of finding its market, especially

2022
01:45:54,440 --> 01:46:00,960
versus Steam, to merge all the gaming into one place and to really kind of homogenize,

2023
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:06,920
if you will, the Xbox gamertag and the experience and all that, bringing that, you know, connect

2024
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:10,600
to PCs even and all that, kind of bringing that all together.

2025
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:12,520
That all seems kind of smart for Microsoft.

2026
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:15,480
So this seems logical.

2027
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:18,040
So I guess there's really not a lot else to say on that.

2028
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:19,040
Nope.

2029
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:22,640
It'll be interesting, though, what will happen with the Windows 8 integration.

2030
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:25,520
That's what I'm most curious about, because you know it'll somehow integrate into Windows

2031
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:26,520
8.

2032
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:33,720
And I'm really curious how Microsoft is going to tie together the 360 and Windows 8.

2033
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:36,280
Now there's only so much they can do, because, you know, they don't want to get...

2034
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,680
Well, the new interface looks like Windows 8.

2035
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,260
That's an optional interface, though.

2036
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:41,260
That's one thing that...

2037
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:42,260
Thank God.

2038
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:45,680
...they haven't been... that was one type of interface that you can have.

2039
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,840
Like Windows will still have the traditional way of doing it.

2040
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:48,840
Oh, wait.

2041
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:49,840
That's right.

2042
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:50,840
Optional on Windows.

2043
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:51,840
My mistake.

2044
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:52,840
You know.

2045
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:53,840
Required on 360.

2046
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:54,840
So.

2047
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:58,020
Well, it's just like, what is that thing called?

2048
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:01,160
The multimedia Windows thing that you can do on the 360?

2049
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:02,160
I know.

2050
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,160
Windows Media Center.

2051
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,360
Windows Live or whatever.

2052
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:07,800
Like, you know, that was a lot of what was shown in Windows 7, but how many people really

2053
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:08,800
use that?

2054
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:09,800
Like, I can't use that in my house.

2055
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,160
It's too damn slow.

2056
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:14,200
So I don't know how many people use that, but there you go.

2057
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:15,200
All right.

2058
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:17,600
Anyhow, one other story for you guys, and then we'll get into the Classic Game of the

2059
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,600
Week.

2060
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:21,160
This is about a different classic game, GoldenEye.

2061
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:26,100
A domain has been spotted for a game called GoldenEye Reloaded.

2062
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:27,100
Not just one domain.

2063
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:28,360
A bunch of games.

2064
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:34,680
Is it possible that last year's Wii game will be coming out on the 360 and PS3?

2065
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:36,600
Could it maybe be getting a sequel?

2066
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,840
Nobody or could it just mean fucking nothing?

2067
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:44,440
It could be any of the above, but that domain has been spotted and it indicates that GoldenEye

2068
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:48,640
is not quite dead, even though the Wii version got kind of lukewarm reviews.

2069
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:52,680
But what would happen if that game came out in HD on the 360 or PS3?

2070
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:55,520
That I would say that's actually kind of rad if that happens.

2071
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:00,320
Someone had already done the translation to, like, HD already, but it got kind of tied

2072
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:03,960
up with the whole rights being owned by different people.

2073
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:08,240
Yeah, but does Activision pretty much solely own the James Bond stuff now?

2074
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:15,320
Yeah, but I think that's why GoldenEye came out on the Wii and not on the other systems,

2075
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:19,600
because the other James Bond games are terrible.

2076
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:23,280
All right, let's go to the gaming vault.

2077
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:28,840
And we're going to take a stroll down the gaming lane and find a classic video game

2078
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:33,720
in the vault that Dark Soccer says, hey, you kids need to respect where your games come

2079
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:34,720
from.

2080
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:38,160
You know, you wouldn't have Earth Defense, Forts, Insect, Armageddon.

2081
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:42,000
You wouldn't have The Last Story or any of these games if it weren't for games such as

2082
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
this one.

2083
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,880
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

2084
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,200
This is a game that I played when I was five years old.

2085
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,760
Wow, so this would have been like 50 years ago?

2086
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:51,760
Shut up.

2087
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,760
Just kidding.

2088
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:57,840
It's called The Quest for the Rings, and it was on the Odyssey 2 and video pack.

2089
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,880
Came out in 1981.

2090
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,880
Let's listen to some of those bleeps and bloops.

2091
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:08,160
Yep, that's what the game sounds like.

2092
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,520
That's when it's having you pick your class.

2093
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:14,080
Let me get to something like...

2094
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:17,680
That's going to hurt our listeners' ears, but there you go, it's in the background.

2095
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:18,680
I love this game.

2096
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:24,880
And keep in mind, I played this game actually for a few years, because when I moved next

2097
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:29,240
door to a couple other friends, they had an Odyssey 2.

2098
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:32,720
So I got to play it again, and I loved the game even over the years.

2099
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:37,920
But okay, Quest for the Rings basically was sort of...

2100
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,560
It's what Gauntlet should have been based off of.

2101
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:47,760
It was very gauntlet-y, but you know, this came out, you know, four years before Gauntlet

2102
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,920
existed.

2103
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,600
It had a board game released with it.

2104
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:55,560
It was a combination of a video game and a board game.

2105
01:49:55,560 --> 01:50:02,640
Came in this huge-ass box, it was gorgeous, and you had one person who was the ringmaster.

2106
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:08,320
So sort of like a combination between playing the D&D board game and playing Gauntlet, you

2107
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,320
know.

2108
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:16,320
So, you could play the board game with the stuff that would go on in the Quest mode,

2109
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:20,800
or you could actually just play the game in Quest mode and play through the different

2110
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:21,800
levels.

2111
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:27,240
This was the game that I was trying to remember the name of, like, a few episodes ago.

2112
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:30,260
So you had four classes that you could play as.

2113
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:35,400
You could be a warrior, who, he can, you know, kill stuff.

2114
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:41,200
You could be a wizard who can stun other, you know, enemies.

2115
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:50,160
You could also be a changeling, who could turn invisible, except when the changeling

2116
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:53,760
was invisible, you couldn't see him either.

2117
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:57,560
And then there was the phantom, who could walk through all kinds of walls, except for

2118
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:00,560
one kind, and he did it at half-speed.

2119
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:05,000
Which actually, I would usually pick either the phantom or the changeling, but the phantom

2120
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:09,680
was super convenient to have, because there were levels later on where the walls would

2121
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:11,720
change location.

2122
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:12,960
It was super aggravating.

2123
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,320
Okay, the gameplay video stopped because there was only about two minutes of it, but can

2124
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:20,120
I, I found this related video that I'd seen before that's actually pretty funny.

2125
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:21,960
This is how games were marketed back then.

2126
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:24,880
I want to play the commercial for this game real quick.

2127
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:31,880
Wizard of Odyssey, is the keyboard really the key to greater challenge in video games?

2128
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:32,880
Of course it is.

2129
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,880
You can play strategy games like Quest for the Rings.

2130
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,880
Plan your strategy on the game board.

2131
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,880
Use the keyboard to change heroes, enemies, racers.

2132
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:42,880
Be a wizard, ultimate, fire a dragon.

2133
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:43,880
Take that dragon.

2134
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,880
We wizards hate to lose.

2135
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:49,880
Master strategy series, only from Odyssey 2, where the keyboard is the key to greater

2136
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:50,880
challenge.

2137
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,880
By Odyssey, get $82 worth of free games, including Quest for the Rings and Pickaxe Pete.

2138
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:56,880
Take that dragon.

2139
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,880
I had pick, we had Pickaxe Pete too.

2140
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:02,880
Dude, just $82 worth of games, so that was $41 a piece.

2141
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:09,880
So this game, with its bleepy bloops, $41 in 19, what is this commercial, 1981 I think?

2142
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:10,880
Yeah.

2143
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:11,880
Was this commercial?

2144
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,880
And that's, I mean games were expensive.

2145
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:14,880
Yeah.

2146
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:15,880
So.

2147
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:16,880
Now.

2148
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:17,880
It's interesting too that they used the keyboard.

2149
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:18,880
It's really the niche for the Odyssey.

2150
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:22,880
I guess just be competitive with the 2600, like real gaming uses a keyboard.

2151
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,880
Which is funny because that argument is still used today.

2152
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:32,480
Well, the other thing with, with the Odyssey 2 is that it was also advertised as an educational

2153
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:35,080
system too, because there were a number of educational games on it.

2154
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:39,880
Like one that we used to play all the time was Crypt Equip, where you put in a word.

2155
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:40,880
Okay.

2156
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:44,420
Well, we're still talking classic into the week, so.

2157
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:49,440
You put in a word and then it scrambles it, and we would always pick one person in our

2158
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:54,640
group that had to unscramble the word, and so they'd have us face the wall, except whenever

2159
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:58,520
it was me, I mean I was always really good at it anyway, but the wall that they would

2160
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:01,280
have us face had a mirror on it.

2161
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:05,440
And I've been able to read backwards since I've been able to read.

2162
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:07,280
So it was never that difficult.

2163
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:12,200
And this also was a system that had K.C. Munchkin, or was it Munchkin or Crazy Chase that was

2164
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,200
the Pac-Man clone?

2165
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:14,720
K.C. Munchkin I think it's called.

2166
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:15,720
Yeah.

2167
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:18,400
Which I've actually got a couple copies of.

2168
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,880
But there was a cease and desist put on them.

2169
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:25,560
So to find, I mean it's not really super expensive, but to find a copy of K.C. Munchkin is, you

2170
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,320
know, kind of a find.

2171
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:29,920
So what made this game awesome to a five year old?

2172
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:34,960
Well, it was just that you could, you know, you could fight a dragon, but the dragon,

2173
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,520
you know, you couldn't kill the dragon.

2174
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:40,840
And it was just an adventure game, like look how awesome the dragon looked.

2175
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:42,720
The big green blip.

2176
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:43,720
That was serious graphics!

2177
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:44,720
Godzilla!

2178
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:45,720
It's Godzilla!

2179
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:51,160
I'm going to show everybody what this picture looks like, because I mean seriously, that

2180
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:55,920
was pretty hardcore awesome graphics for, you know, when I was five.

2181
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:59,720
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

2182
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:00,720
Oh, I'm sorry, there's more?

2183
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:01,720
Yes!

2184
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:02,720
Oh, it sounded like we were done.

2185
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:03,720
Alright, then what else?

2186
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:06,480
Well, I was going to tell you about the other things that were in the game.

2187
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:07,480
Oh, okay, well please do.

2188
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,480
Well then let me restart the music.

2189
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:15,160
You had five kinds of monsters, and they had the most awesome names.

2190
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:21,040
There were orcs and fire wraiths, who were really, they actually looked just alike except

2191
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,040
they were different colors.

2192
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:23,040
One was pink, one was blue.

2193
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:26,400
Then you had dragons, which they basically moved left and right across the screen, but

2194
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:30,600
if you got in the way, they'd be like ROAR and run at you, and it would be like, oh shit,

2195
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,400
it's a dragon!

2196
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:38,120
And there was the nightmares that had different names.

2197
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:43,320
There was Spidroth Tarantulas, which is a giant spider, and Doomed Wing Bloodthirst,

2198
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:50,040
which makes me think that the designers of WoW played this game and took inspiration

2199
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:52,720
from the characters in the game.

2200
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:59,720
But I mean, I always, this is one game that I seriously thought they should totally remake,

2201
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:06,520
because it was just, the theory behind it was so awesome.

2202
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,740
It really was.

2203
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:16,040
It was simple, simple gameplay, but it did it so effectively that I don't think any other

2204
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:21,300
game has been, you know, if I'm looking back to this as one of my favorite classic games

2205
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:27,400
ever, then, you know, it's gotta have something, say something for it's staying power.

2206
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:32,280
But I'll go ahead and actually link what the cover looked like in the chat room, because

2207
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:36,000
it had a really epic 80's cover, because, man, that's when people actually drew shit

2208
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
by hand.

2209
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Alright, I'm done.

2210
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:43,440
Classic giveaway of the week, the quest for the rings for the Odyssey 2.

2211
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,440
Damn that's old.

2212
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:48,040
Alright, we're gonna take a break here, but don't worry, there's plenty more of Orange

2213
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:51,480
Launch Radio to come, thank god there's no work tomorrow.

2214
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:52,560
Fear!

2215
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,520
So yep, we can stay up late a little bit.

2216
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:55,520
Pinkberry run!

2217
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:59,520
Pinkberry closes at 10, we're not gonna be done by 10, I hate to break it to you.

2218
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,160
I'll send the husband to come get it.

2219
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:03,160
Now that I can play into.

2220
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:07,640
Alright, we gotta take a break though, when we come back, there's plenty more Orange Launch

2223
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:17,560

01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,680
You're thinking of vanilla ice.

01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:22,640
No, maybe this lovely cup of ice water I have.

2240
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:24,040

2246
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:52,680
It's a show about the world of Warcraft and it's myself and Extifer doing lolsy Warcraft

2247
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:55,420
chat and this week was a real fun show.

2248
01:57:55,420 --> 01:58:01,000
We talked a lot, there was a brand new patch in WoW this week, 4.2, and also huge news

2249
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
about Warcraft.

2250
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,120
It didn't make this show roll, probably because I already talked about it on Hoard House,

2251
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:09,080
but WoW has gone free to play in some ways.

2252
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:15,160
Level 20, basically what existed as the free trial before is now an unlimited trial, it's

2253
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:18,760
not capped to 14 days, so you can play all the way to level 20.

2254
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:21,480
Lots of restrictions with that though, I don't think you can join a guild or what have you,

2255
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:25,240
but more information about the Hoard House Guild and all that stuff is on hoardhouse.com.

2256
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:28,560
Now DarkStalker, I understand you guested on a Warcraft show this week, right?

2257
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:29,560
Yes I did.

2258
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:30,560
Can we talk about it?

2259
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:31,560
Yeah!

2260
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:32,560
Ok, cool.

2261
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:38,020
I was on Girls Gone WoW, which you can go to their website at girlsgonewow.net and they

2262
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:39,480
are UK players.

2263
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:40,480
Yes.

2264
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:44,600
Which, we actually got into a discussion about, we really wish that there was some way that

2265
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:49,800
we could cross zones in play, because you can't play on...

2266
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:53,640
Oh yeah, it's one of the biggest drawbacks of WoW is that there's no way for us to roll

2267
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:58,760
on Europe and they can't roll on us, unless you actually buy that region's copy of the

2268
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:01,600
freaking game and do it that way, and it's kind of a pain in the ass.

2269
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,600
That's butt-tarded.

2270
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:07,360
So, but the host over there still, we're good net friends, because she's been on Hoard House

2271
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:09,840
a couple of times now and always brings the lulz.

2272
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:11,760
But I signed up on their forums.

2273
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:12,760
They're fun people.

2274
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:13,760
Great!

2275
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:18,920
And we had a really, really good time, really long discussion.

2276
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:24,040
I hope to go back again, prospects seem hopeful.

2277
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,040
Excellent!

2278
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:29,200
And they were just great people, all three of them, I really enjoyed the time I had.

2279
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:30,200
Wonderful!

2280
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:32,720
Don't you just love, what's her name, EJ's accent?

2281
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:33,720
Yes.

2282
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:34,720
Love her accent.

2283
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:35,720
Love it.

2284
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:38,000
I just want to put it in a little voice box and open it.

2285
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,400
The haters are gonna hate.

2286
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:43,520
She says, fuck all, better than anyone I've ever heard.

2287
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:48,440
Okay, by the way, we got a tweet from the Girls Gone WoW show on Twitter, at twitter.com

2288
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:51,620
slash o-l-r is our Twitter and ggwshow is theirs.

2289
01:59:51,620 --> 01:59:54,240
I loved having DarkSakura on our podcast.

2290
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:55,360
She was an amazing guest.

2291
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:59,160
I'm in your show, kidnapping your host, kisses.

2292
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:00,160
So.

2293
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,160
Okay.

2294
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:02,160
Hey!

2295
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:03,160
No!

2296
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:04,160
You're here first.

2297
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:06,720
I'll call you to that chair.

2298
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:08,880
No, I think that's great.

2299
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:13,560
Also, since I said it on Bobby's show tonight, I guess we could say it here.

2300
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:18,080
There is a third podcast in the works.

2301
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:19,080
Yes, there is.

2302
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:22,740
And we're looking at taping the pilot in the next week or so.

2303
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:25,100
And I'm hoping we'll have more information soon.

2304
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:26,760
But that's all you get.

2305
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:27,760
I can say one thing.

2306
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:28,760
What's that?

2307
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:29,760
It will involve a Dan.

2308
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:30,760
Okay, we can say that.

2309
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:32,280
Yep, it will involve Dan.

2310
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:33,280
It will involve Dan.

2311
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,280
Yeah, we're gonna leave it at that.

2312
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:35,280
I said a Dan.

2313
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,280
A Dan.

2314
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:37,280
It did not say which Dan.

2315
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:40,280
It will involve a Dan.

2316
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:42,160
Alright.

2317
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:44,780
Let's get into some rapid-fire news.

2318
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:49,340
Let's go to the news that there's lots of news this week and some of it we just don't

2319
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:53,040
have time to talk 15 minutes about like we did some of those Nintendo stories tonight.

2320
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:55,320
Loki, why don't you start us off?

2321
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:56,320
Uh, yes.

2322
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,320
This is kinda neat.

2323
02:00:57,320 --> 02:01:01,920
Kotaku, I don't know if they've been doing the actual translations themselves, but they've

2324
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:11,200
been running on their website every Thursday starting a couple weeks ago, localized versions

2325
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:12,880
of Retro Game Master.

2326
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:19,320
Now for those who haven't heard of Retro Game Master, it's a show in Japan that has this

2327
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:24,980
game master who plays through old classic games and there's kind of commentary going

2328
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:25,980
along with it.

2329
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:29,840
So it's like the same thing I see on billions of YouTube channels and just on TV.

2330
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:34,160
But it's funny, you know, he has trouble with some of the games and it's his commentary.

2331
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:35,960
Professionally written, I guess?

2332
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:38,320
I guess, I don't know.

2333
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:42,680
So the first episode was Ninja Gaiden and then of course this week's episode was Super

2334
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:44,200
Fantasy Zone.

2335
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:50,120
But you can check them out, they're streaming, like I said, every Thursday on their Thursday

2336
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:54,460
at 8pm Eastern is when they have the thing going.

2337
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:55,720
So check it out.

2338
02:01:55,720 --> 02:01:59,560
I mean, this is the type of stuff that should have been on G4 back in the day when they

2339
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:00,560
talked about games.

2340
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:04,120
That was the Portal 2 information.

2341
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:05,120
Portal 2...

2342
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:06,120
Can I back up real quick?

2343
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:09,440
Sorry, I was talking to our chatters who now, of course, are asking a ton of questions on

2344
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:13,040
that little tease about the other podcast.

2345
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:16,240
They teamed up with Kotaku to put the episodes out?

2346
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:17,240
Yes.

2347
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:18,240
That's interesting.

2348
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:20,880
I mean, I'm not going to Kotaku, it's a fine website, what have you, but it's just interesting.

2349
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:31,440
It's not like a big Hulu or Netflix or even YouTube, it's a very kind of niche gaming

2350
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:32,440
site.

2351
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:36,040
I mean, it's one of the bigger gaming blogs, certainly, but it's just an interesting path.

2352
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:41,080
I don't think of Kotaku television very often, so it's interesting for them.

2353
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:42,080
Yeah.

2354
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:49,000
So anyways, Portal 2, they had a map contest recently and they've had the winners chosen

2355
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:54,440
for that, and it's part of the Summer Mapping Initiative contest.

2356
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:59,560
The winning map, I guess a map called Patent Pending, took top prize.

2357
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:06,400
Also another called Infinifling, that was, I guess, focusing on mid-air portaling techniques,

2358
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:07,400
that was second.

2359
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:12,240
And then Endifice, which is based on some destroyed Aperture Chambers, picked up an

2360
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:13,240
honorable mention.

2361
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:18,760
Now, all these are available to download at, of course, the Portal website, thinkingwithportals.com.

2362
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:24,680
And many other user-created levels, so if you've played through Portal 2 already on

2363
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:29,640
PC and you want to go back and try some custom maps and stuff, you can go and download these

2364
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:31,560
and it's really easy to access them in-game.

2365
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:35,320
So I haven't really played around with this yet, but I always thought if this came out

2366
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:38,080
it would kind of all be integrated into Steam, but it's not.

2367
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:43,800
Like I have to go to this website and do, like, I don't have to hack my game per se,

2368
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:44,800
right?

2369
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:45,800
But don't I have to have this dev mode or something?

2370
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:46,800
No, not really.

2371
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:51,800
You just, you pull up the developers, the console in the game by hitting the title key,

2372
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:54,400
and then you just, there's a simple command you put in there.

2373
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:55,400
Hmm, okay.

2374
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:56,400
Well, that's cool.

2375
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:57,400
To play the stuff.

2376
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:58,400
So, yeah.

2377
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:03,200
And, I mean, it'd be kind of cool if they integrated it with, like, some sort of map,

2378
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:06,240
you know, option in, like, a menu or something like that where you can just select a map

2379
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:07,240
and play it.

2380
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:10,640
Or, you know, maybe make multiple maps or something like that so you can have your own

2381
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:11,640
single-player campaigns.

2382
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:17,000
And, of course, obviously, not something that you're going to be able to play on consoles

2383
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
yet.

2384
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:24,600
And then, finally, Left 4 Dead 2, apparently they had a little Easter egg in there.

2385
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:32,520
There was a community-made campaign called Suicide Blitz 2 in Left 4 Dead 2, and it's

2386
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:37,020
one of the officially featured fan-created add-ons for the game.

2387
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:40,800
And it has a very neat Portal 2 Easter egg buried in it.

2388
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:51,640
Apparently, if you, um, you find a portal, I guess, into the actual Aperture Science

2389
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:58,320
in there, and it says, uh, you can, um, I guess, figure, you find the Aperture Science

2390
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:05,040
and also Companion Cube, Propression Gel, Special Infected Zombies, and all sorts of

2391
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:06,040
neat stuff.

2392
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:08,840
I was watching the video, there was a video attached to the story that had two giggling

2393
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:14,080
girls playing the game, and, um, it was, it looked really well done, like, from what I

2394
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:15,080
was watching.

2395
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:19,080
So, uh, yeah, I mean, it looked like you were frickin' playing Portal, but inside Left 4

2396
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,080
Dead.

2397
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:22,280
So, I like those wacky, zany crossovers.

2398
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:26,640
Yes, and I like how you have to find a gnome.

2399
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:27,640
Yes.

2400
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:31,720
But they have her voice and everything, the infamous GLaDOS voice is in there.

2401
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:33,120
So, that's really cool.

2402
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,120
Very cool.

2403
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:35,120
Alright, going to some other stories.

2404
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:38,760
Uh, Street Fighter 4, the ports keep on comin'.

2405
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:41,160
This one is called Street Fighter 4 Volt.

2406
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:42,840
It's coming out on the iPhone.

2407
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:46,200
It will have three new fighters and Wi-Fi support.

2408
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,680
Uh, Volt, it's now available.

2409
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:49,160
It's not something you have to wait for.

2410
02:05:49,160 --> 02:05:52,940
It was announced at a Capcom event in Tokyo, but it's available now.

2411
02:05:52,940 --> 02:05:54,840
There are three new fighters available.

2412
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:57,200
Balrog, Vega, and Cody.

2413
02:05:57,200 --> 02:06:00,360
Keep in mind that when Street Fighter 4 was ported to the iPhone, not all the fighters

2414
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:02,320
from the game made it over.

2415
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:05,360
So yes, having some of these characters in it is new.

2416
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:07,000
Seventeen fighters available.

2417
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
So there you go.

2418
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,560
Uh, you can get Volt for a buck, but the price is going up each day by one dollar.

2419
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:16,800
So about now, it's about $3.99 or $4.99.

2420
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:20,380
On July 6th, the game will be $6.99.

2421
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:21,620
That will be its final price.

2422
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:22,680
But you know what?

2423
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:26,520
They have these 99 cent sales all the time, so if you miss it, you can like wait a month.

2424
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:27,520
Just wait.

2425
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,480
You can do it.

2426
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:31,040
That's Street Fighter 4 Volt.

2427
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:36,000
Uh, also, uh, in Retro Gaming's Getting Upgrades, Boulder Dash.

2428
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,240
You remember this game, Boulder Dash?

2429
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:41,520
I remember this because this was huge on the Commodore 64, uh, was the series Boulder Dash.

2430
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:46,280
And I think a lot of the, um, old PC, er, not PC, sorry, old computing platforms like

2431
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:49,400
the Apples and so forth, this game saw some type of port on it.

2432
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:51,120
These games were huge back in the 80s.

2433
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:53,280
Well, it's getting a remake, I guess you could say.

2434
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,680
It's an HD update.

2435
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:57,880
It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon, July 13th.

2436
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:01,880
Uh, it will be just shy of the Summer Arcade promotion.

2437
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:06,440
Unfortunately it's going to be going up against Ms. Splosion Man, so, uh, it might fall through

2438
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:10,800
the cracks a little bit, but if you're fond of the old game on the 64 or whatever computer

2439
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:14,280
back in the day, Boulder Dash XL is on its way.

2440
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:19,440
Uh, it will have seven times the amount of caves as the original 1984 version.

2441
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:21,520
It's coming out from Calypso Media.

2442
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:26,720
There will be a new puzzle mode with items like speed enhancers and telescoping arms,

2443
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,120
online leaderboards.

2444
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:31,000
It will set you back 800 Microsoft points.

2445
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:37,640
There will also be a PC version late in the summer if you are a personal computing purist

2446
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:40,640
and you don't want to play the game on one of those evil consoles.

2447
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:46,040
Speaking of evil consoles, there's more news on the Wii U and, uh, it has to do with the

2448
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:47,280
Zelda game.

2449
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:51,520
Well, Nintendo has come out and said, hey, that Zelda game that'll inevitably come out

2450
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:56,240
on the Wii U, yeah, it's not really going to look like that E3 demo.

2451
02:07:56,240 --> 02:08:00,960
So that video we showed and all that, that was just, that was all concept videos.

2452
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:03,720
So just, just so you know, it's not necessarily what's going to happen.

2453
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:08,240
Hey, you remember when we originally showed Zelda on the GameCube and then we put out

2454
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:10,640
Wind Waker that was all cel shaded?

2455
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:13,320
Yeah, that, that might happen too.

2456
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:19,840
This all coming out from an interview with Zelda longtime producer Eiji Onuma who said,

2457
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:23,720
so when we show a graphic demo, people think, oh, this is what the next Zelda will look

2458
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:26,520
like, but that's not necessarily the case.

2459
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:31,200
And, uh, they also cite, again, the Wind Waker GameCube comparison there.

2460
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:35,360
So, uh, confirmed Wii U Zelda to be cel shaded, right?

2461
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:36,360
Okay.

2462
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:37,360
Maybe not quite.

2463
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:39,760
Dar Sakura, what do you have for us?

2464
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:40,760
Rock Band!

2465
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:42,640
Because we like Rock Band.

2466
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:44,800
New download content.

2467
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:49,640
It will be For What It's Worth by Buffalo Springfield, Man on the Moon by R.E.M., Aerials

2468
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:55,600
by System of the Down, Hypnotized by System of the Down, and Turning Japanese by The Vapors.

2469
02:08:55,600 --> 02:09:00,880
And for Aerials and Turning Japanese and For What It's Worth, there will be Pro Guitar

2470
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:05,520
Bass Expansions available for another 80 Microsoft points.

2471
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,960
Yay.

2472
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:11,680
And next up, Final Fantasy Tactics for the iOS is delayed.

2473
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:13,960
That's according to Squeenix's Facebook page.

2474
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:20,760
Needs a little bit more time, so it's going to be in late July instead of June, um, as

2475
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:21,760
they said it would.

2476
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:25,240
I think that might be a little old, but it's going to be on, you have to have the bare

2477
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:28,200
minimum of an iPhone 3GS to play it.

2478
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:33,440
And this is the remake of the Playstation 1 version, so it's the good one.

2479
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:38,600
And then, last but not least, oh, you addict people, Minecraft!

2480
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:44,160
They passed 10 million registered users.

2481
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:48,400
And that's according to Marcus Person's blog.

2482
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:56,840
So they are now officially at 10,005,304.

2483
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:00,600
The people who actually bought it are in the 2 million range, so.

2484
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:01,600
That's still pretty good.

2485
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:05,120
2 million copies of the game, 1 out of every 5 are buying it.

2486
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:06,120
Yeah.

2487
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:07,120
That's not bad.

2488
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:13,680
But they say that basically they're getting 42,000 new players registering in the last

2489
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:15,680
24 hours.

2490
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:17,640
Can I take my registration back?

2491
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:18,640
Just kidding.

2492
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:21,640
I'm not that big a jerk, I promise.

2493
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:23,880
Well yay for Minecraft, and yay for our Twitter!

2494
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:29,200
Every week you guys send us tweets at twitter.com slash O-L-R, and we read some of your tweets

2495
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:31,280
here live on air.

2496
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:32,800
Not a lot of tweets tonight, actually.

2497
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:35,800
There's like, not a lot of Twitter news tonight.

2498
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:42,840
Uh, MNZeba says this tweet saying, uh, Xenoblade, or Monado, Beginning of the World, is actually

2499
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:49,000
number 3 on the Best Sellers in Nintendo Wii Action Games list at Amazon.com.

2500
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,240
And she gives us a link here to Amazon.com Best Sellers.

2501
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:55,600
It's actually up to number 2 now, just so you know.

2502
02:10:55,600 --> 02:11:00,080
Super Smash Bros. Brawl is the game that's beating it, and it in turn is beating, Monado

2503
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:07,520
is beating Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Lego Star Wars.

2504
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:09,120
So, interesting.

2505
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:13,200
I mean, granted, keep in mind, we are looking at just the action game list.

2506
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:15,800
I want to see where it ranks overall.

2507
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:21,640
I'm looking at the overall list, and it's number 16.

2508
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:27,160
That's still not bad overall, but just so you know, overall, Monado is being beat by

2509
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:35,480
a Wii Nunchuck controller in black, and the HD component cable, which is number 8.

2510
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:40,480
Another tweet to us from Tiger Claw sends us a tweet saying, Space Station internet

2511
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:43,000
too slow for online video games.

2512
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:47,720
Uh, let's see, it links us to a Kotaku article here.

2513
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:50,040
Regarding life in space, everyone has three questions.

2514
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:51,040
How do you poop?

2515
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:53,400
Has anyone screwed, and can you play video games up there?

2516
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:55,680
They poop in a vacuum tube.

2517
02:11:55,680 --> 02:11:56,680
It's true.

2518
02:11:56,680 --> 02:11:57,680
They poop in a vacuum cleaner.

2519
02:11:57,680 --> 02:11:59,080
Our soccer would know the answer to that.

2520
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:05,280
Anyhow, a Canadian astronaut, I didn't know they had astronauts in Canada.

2521
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:06,280
Canadians in space.

2522
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:08,680
That'd be a great sitcom.

2523
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:14,080
Anyhow, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield said that the internet connection aboard the

2524
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:18,040
International Space Station is simply too slow for games.

2525
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:23,280
He compared it to a 56K dial-up modem, but I guess the reason why it stinks is because

2526
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:26,300
of the space station's orbital velocity speed.

2527
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:31,960
That thing moves at 5 miles per second, because keep in mind, it's orbiting the Earth.

2528
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:36,520
So Hadfield was the first Canadian to walk in space, and he's going to be, he's in line

2529
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:39,760
anyway to become the first Canadian commander of the space station.

2530
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:41,920
And clearly he must be a gamer.

2531
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:44,960
This all came out during a Canada Day event in Edmonton.

2532
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:46,600
So thank you for the link, Tiger Claw.

2533
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:49,400
Uh, Blinder says it's a tweet.

2534
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:55,240
Blinder222, to be specific, on Twitter, says, did any of you play the Uncharted 3 beta?

2535
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:56,880
Sadly, I haven't.

2536
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:03,000
I want to, but I just registered my PlayStation Plus yesterday, because remember, oh by the

2537
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:07,280
way, PSA, it's July 3rd, this is like the last chance for you to get the stuff in the

2538
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:08,280
Welcome Back program.

2539
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:10,600
You don't have to download that stuff, you just have to pick what you want.

2540
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:11,600
Oh, really?

2541
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:12,600
I think.

2542
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:13,600
I mean, I'm assuming, because it appeared on my-

2543
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:15,880
Just fucking download it if you're going to get it.

2544
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:16,880
The servers are fine now.

2545
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:22,200
No, it appeared on my, uh, my download list now, but it's just, I, you know, because I

2546
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:25,800
have my PlayStation up in the front room and I have to drag, you know, an ethernet cable,

2547
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:29,760
because remember, old ass PlayStation, no Wi-Fi built in, because it's a 20 gig.

2548
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:35,720
Um, so I have to put, um, you know, an ethernet cable, drag it into the front room, and see,

2549
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:40,080
last night I wanted to play Earth Defense Force online as well, and yeah, I can do that

2550
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:43,480
with my console, but for some reason I wanted to plug it in.

2551
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:49,360
Anyhow, uh, yeah, so I, I, I'm going to check it out hopefully in the next week, but I tell

2552
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:51,080
you guys, I have like a backlog of games to play.

2553
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:56,600
I still have Loki's L.A. Noire, I haven't even touched yet, and I have, um, uh, two

2554
02:13:56,600 --> 02:14:00,720
racing games that I have for my rental service, and I have touched none of it, because I've

2555
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:03,720
been playing this new Warcraft patch, I've been playing the other games I've been talking

2556
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:07,000
about, and Final Fantasy 13, I'm up to 30 hours in Final Fantasy 13.

2557
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Rob.

2558
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
What?

2559
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Are your racing games PS3, any of them?

2560
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,960
They're Xbox 360, but they're from my rental service.

2561
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:16,880
Oh, I was gonna say, uh, we've got like a huge driving setup for PS3.

2562
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:17,880
Oh, fun.

2563
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,040
Nah, it's 360.

2564
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:25,600
I got, it's, uh, Test Drive Unlimited 2, and one of the, one of the Need for Speed games,

2565
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:26,600
whatever.

2566
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:27,600
Shift 2 Unleashed?

2567
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:28,600
Uh, I think it's...

2568
02:14:28,600 --> 02:14:29,600
Or is it Hot Pursuit?

2569
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:30,600
I think it's Hot Pursuit.

2570
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:31,600
I don't, I, I have to look.

2571
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:32,600
I don't remember.

2572
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:36,000
What's the, not, wait, no, isn't Hot Pursuit the one they just announced that isn't even

2573
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
out yet?

2574
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,680
No, the runs the one they, they announced, Hot Pursuit is the one that came out last

2575
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:40,680
November.

2576
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:41,880
Oh, that one looks badass, I gotta say.

2577
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:43,720
That new one looks fucking rad, I wanna play that.

2578
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:47,480
No, Hot Pursuit is the one that came out back in November, Shift 2 Unleashed was the one

2579
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:50,880
that's sort of like Project Gotham that came out back in March.

2580
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:53,640
And then, uh, yeah, the run's the one that's coming out later on.

2581
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:57,320
So yes, at some point, I will get to Uncharted 3 before they close the beta, it's just, you

2582
02:14:57,320 --> 02:15:00,780
know, I gotta, I actually have a pretty big gaming queue right now of stuff I wanna play,

2583
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:04,840
and I'm still trying to beat Final Fantasy 13, which is just, like, I'm, like, so into

2584
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:05,840
it right now.

2585
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:06,840
And, like, it's spreading.

2586
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:09,400
Like, did you see Bobby Blackwolf, our, uh, guy before us here?

2587
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:10,400
I should finish mine.

2588
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:14,280
He, he posted a tweet last night, he said, you know what?

2589
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:18,180
After a year, it's time for me to beat Chapter 10, which is funny, because I didn't struggle

2590
02:15:18,180 --> 02:15:19,320
on that same boss fight.

2591
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:21,720
There were boss fights I struggled on, but not that one.

2592
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:25,000
There were some, there were some Eidolon fights that made me wanna just, ugh.

2593
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:31,920
I'll have Saz's Eidolon, I, I, I, oh my god, I went crazy on that fight, just so you know.

2594
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:36,000
I have to find my save, it's on one of the hard drives I have, because I've swapped hard

2595
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
drives around.

2596
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:40,600
I know it's not on that console, because, um, you know, that's the internal hard drive.

2597
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:44,520
But I have to track it down, and once I do, then I'll play it.

2598
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:46,520
Alright.

2599
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:47,520
Let's move on.

2600
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:54,360
Uh, another tweet, last tweet here, from TigerClaw305 on Twitter, Professor Layton movie is getting

2601
02:15:54,360 --> 02:16:00,280
a US release, and, oh, I hate these websites that have ads you have to click through, uh,

2602
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:08,080
let's see, um, Professor Layton, a manga and an animated feature film, the latter, Professor

2603
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:13,200
Layton and the Eternal Diva, excuse me, was first released in Japan in December 09.

2604
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:16,680
It wasn't something you'd necessarily expect to make it out of Japan, but an English version

2605
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:19,520
was created for British markets and was released last year.

2606
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:24,000
See how they do that Nintendo, they release something that's, you know, English language

2607
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:28,200
and release it in British markets, and then they can come over here without any, any effort

2608
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:31,020
whatsoever, because it's already translated into English.

2609
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:35,400
As revealed at Anime Expo 2011 this weekend, the feature length animated film is on its

2610
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:39,160
way to North America, reports Anime Your Way.

2611
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:42,680
It was actually fairly well received, and the developer, Level 5, has already commissioned

2612
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:44,560
a sequel and would like a new movie out annually.

2613
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:49,200
And I'd like to add also, but seeing as we're talking about anime movies coming out soon,

2614
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:52,840
um, they announced a Trigun movie coming out, and that's awesome.

2615
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:54,200
The trailer, did you watch it?

2616
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:55,200
Yes I did.

2617
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:56,440
Oh, that's so nice.

2618
02:16:56,440 --> 02:17:00,160
It will take place, obviously, during the series, because, uh, for, you know, obvious,

2619
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,160
obvious reasons.

2620
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:05,760
But that is very exciting.

2621
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:08,800
Alright, that's it for Twitter topics tonight, let's get back to some other gaming news,

2622
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:09,800
Loki.

2623
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:13,000
Alright, let's talk a little bit about Minecraft, since, uh, we were just talking about Minecraft

2624
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
not too long ago.

2625
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:23,360
Uh, Minecraft 1.7 is out now, and it adds pistons and deadly sheep, because, you know,

2626
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:27,800
I think that kind of reminds me of, what was it, the black sheep, um, movie that they put

2627
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:29,840
out a while ago, where the sheep are zombies.

2628
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:30,840
It's funny.

2629
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:34,960
Uh, but yes, pistons, though, you can make, uh, more complex machines now, so that's kind

2630
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:36,520
of cool.

2631
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:46,760
And, um, also, apparently, uh, Minecraft update 1.8 has been, uh, delayed a little bit, by

2632
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:53,760
a week, and 1.8 would add, uh, the Minecraft Adventure mode, and that'll be coming, uh,

2633
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:54,760
very soon.

2634
02:17:54,760 --> 02:18:01,960
Apparently, um, 1.8 is released in the next few months, and they're saying that they're

2635
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:10,240
also starting the crunch for the full release, which is gonna be on 11.11.11, so, yeah, neat.

2636
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:15,960
And the Adventure mode, I believe, was, like, where you can actually create your own, um,

2637
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:20,440
I think, I know that they've added maps recently, but, uh, maybe you can make your own kind

2638
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:22,160
of, like, Zelda-type game or something.

2639
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:24,880
It should be kind of neat.

2640
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:27,120
Definitely adding a lot more stuff to this.

2641
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:32,600
At some point, I'll have to check it out, just not yet.

2642
02:18:32,600 --> 02:18:33,600
All right.

2643
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:34,600
Uh, DDR News.

2644
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:39,440
Uh, Dar Toagak wants to know, before I get to DDR News, does Loki have Minecraft, question

2645
02:18:39,440 --> 02:18:40,440
mark.

2646
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:41,440
That's from our chatroom.

2647
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:44,280
Um, I have it on my iPod, actually.

2648
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:45,280
Oh, that's interesting.

2649
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:50,280
Uh, cause, you know, that one, uh, Minecraft app or whatever that came out and they got

2650
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:53,600
pulled immediately, yeah, I found it.

2651
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:59,320
So, um, I have that, but I haven't really, I mean, trying to use it on iPods is just,

2652
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:00,320
it's retarded.

2653
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:02,080
Um, no, I haven't really played it yet.

2654
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:05,800
I had, I thought I had downloaded it at one point, but I, I guess not.

2655
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:12,760
All right, um, moving on to, uh, DDR, and this is about a new arcade release.

2656
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:18,000
It's Dance Dance Revolution X3, uh, Konami is moving on with the DDR series, which I'm

2657
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:23,400
just kind of like shaking my head at, but, um, I don't know, I do find this kind of interesting.

2658
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:29,080
The full title of the game is going to be Dance Dance Revolution X3 versus Dance Dance

2659
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:31,360
Revolution Second Mix.

2660
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:36,560
There will be a second mix mode in the game where you can play the full version of Dance

2661
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:42,320
Dance Revolution Second Mix, including all the licensed music that appeared in that game.

2662
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:44,740
Would that include Strictly Business?

2663
02:19:44,740 --> 02:19:45,740
Because that song-

2664
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:46,740
That would be great.

2665
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:48,120
I don't think that is possible.

2666
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:51,800
I think Strictly, it's got to come from the version where Strictly Business got taken

2667
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:55,800
out and a different song got put in, but anyway, we're digressing into too much DDR nerddom.

2668
02:19:55,800 --> 02:20:00,080
Uh, but anyhow, there, they will be introducing new features into the Second Mix game, including

2669
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:02,040
eAmusement capability.

2670
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:05,960
Of course, X3 is really the highlight, and that's the game they want you to play.

2671
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:11,800
Four hundred and eighty tracks in total, uh, standard DDR music, uh, mix songs, uh, let's

2672
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:16,840
see, uh, variety of Bimani artists, transplant songs from other Bimani series, eAmusement

2673
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:21,240
Gate, a community-oriented website for Konami games that allows players to form groups,

2674
02:20:21,240 --> 02:20:23,200
share scores, and interact with other players.

2675
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:27,320
That actually sounds kind of cool, um, will it make an arcade here?

2676
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:28,320
I don't know.

2677
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:30,080
Could it get a home release that good?

2678
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:31,080
Doubt it.

2679
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:32,080
See, that's the-

2680
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:33,080
That's the-

2681
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:34,080
Why can't I get that as a home release?

2682
02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:38,640
See, this is what pisses us off so much, is like, they put all this effort into DDR for

2683
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:44,400
the arcade, which, you know, we would love to believe that the arcade is still, you know,

2684
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:52,320
a viable place to have these type of games, but at the same time, they can't just strictly

2685
02:20:52,320 --> 02:20:54,960
port this to the home console.

2686
02:20:54,960 --> 02:21:00,440
Whatever happened with the problem being, you know, back in the PlayStation 1 days,

2687
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:04,080
just take the arcade release, you put it- bring it home, and you add a couple things.

2688
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,080
Done.

2689
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:06,080
That's it.

2690
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:07,080
People loved it.

2691
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:08,760
Now you gotta change it up now.

2692
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:11,080
I don't understand the point.

2693
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:17,800
Oh, it's because probably licensing 480 songs for home would be a little bit expensive,

2694
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:18,800
I guess.

2695
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:20,800
I don't know.

2696
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:21,800
Alright.

2697
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:26,640
Well, I'm- I'm curious about this whole, like, second- I mean, second mix, just to put it

2698
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:30,240
in perspective for those that haven't followed DDR like we have, it's like 11 years old.

2699
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:31,720
What- the game came out in 99, right?

2700
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:34,240
That was the first one I owned, was second mix on Dreamcast.

2701
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:37,200
Yeah, so it's weird that they're kind of going back to that.

2702
02:21:37,200 --> 02:21:41,080
I mean, dude, I wonder if second mix will have- what was that fucking mode that's only

2703
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:42,080
in second mix, Jamie?

2704
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:43,080
It was like your favorite fucking mode?

2705
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:44,080
Oh shit.

2706
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:45,080
Unison?

2707
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:46,080
Dance battle.

2708
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:47,080
Dance battle.

2709
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:48,080
Maybe that'll come back.

2710
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:49,080
Yeah.

2711
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:50,080
That would actually be kind of rad.

2712
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:51,080
Dance battle was awesome.

2713
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:52,080
Dance battle's the one where you would have a measure where you could just make up your

2714
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:54,280
own steps, and then the other player had to do them.

2715
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:55,280
Yeah.

2716
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:58,560
So you could just- You could only have like two- two things at any beat at a time.

2717
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:02,920
Yeah, I mean, you couldn't go too shit crazy, but they would have to do whatever you just

2718
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:03,920
did.

2719
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:06,760
I mean, we used to just try to fuck each other's day.

2720
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:10,560
And also, on top of that, there was no Vivid.

2721
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:12,040
It was all flat.

2722
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:13,040
Ooh.

2723
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:17,120
We didn't have any of them speed modifiers either.

2724
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:22,240
We didn't have any of them fancy full video backgrounds neither either.

2725
02:22:22,240 --> 02:22:27,480
I mean, this was at third Korean where you could switch it into second mix.

2726
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:28,960
Yes.

2727
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:32,880
Or SSR mode in second mix on the Dreamcast one.

2728
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:33,880
Oh yeah.

2729
02:22:33,880 --> 02:22:34,880
Yeah.

2730
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:35,880
You know what SSR was, people?

2731
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:39,720
Those were all the nine footers.

2732
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:43,040
I'm really curious to see how this translates in the arcades, but we'll see.

2733
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,040
They'll fuck it up somehow.

2734
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:46,040
Prove me wrong, Konami.

2735
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:47,040
I dare you.

2736
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:50,920
You should play Strictly Businesses, our transfer music, after birth.

2737
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:51,920
Remind me after the show.

2738
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:52,920
All right.

2739
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:53,920
Moving on.

2740
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:54,920
Ah.

2741
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:55,920
Dark Sakura, right?

2742
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:56,920
Oh, yes.

2743
02:22:56,920 --> 02:22:57,920
Sorry.

2744
02:22:57,920 --> 02:22:59,600
Stop playing on Facebook.

2745
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:00,600
We're trying to do a show.

2746
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:01,600
Nah.

2747
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:03,840
By the way, can I say something that's pissing me off about Facebook?

2748
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:04,840
What?

2749
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:07,160
I'm still not in the Civ world beta.

2750
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:08,160
That pisses me off.

2751
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:09,160
Just saying.

2752
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:10,160
Sorry, Rob.

2753
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:11,160
I'm mad.

2754
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:12,160
Don't be mad.

2755
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:13,160
Get even.

2756
02:23:13,160 --> 02:23:14,160
So, guess what?

2757
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:25,160
Kazuo Hirai is now the chairman of Sony SEI.

2758
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:30,400
Yeah, he's now the head doodoo in charge.

2759
02:23:30,400 --> 02:23:34,600
And guess who is replacing him as group CEO?

2760
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:36,320
That would be Andrew House.

2761
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:37,320
He's taking over.

2762
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:42,800
But guess what's happening to Ken Kutaragi, the crayon eater and helmet wearer.

2763
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:47,800
He's retiring for reals, except he's going to hang around as senior technology advisor.

2764
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:51,800
He's going to a very special home where they serve crayons for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

2765
02:23:51,800 --> 02:24:00,300
He's going to be eating the rest of his dinner through straws for the rest of his life, because

2766
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:03,920
they don't give you food that you can hurt yourself with in the home.

2767
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:07,880
He's going to be eating some gurber.

2768
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:08,880
No.

2769
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:16,720
But yeah, he actually did retire, but he's remaining behind as senior technology advisor.

2770
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:23,920
And yeah, it seems like a really crappy time to do, like, oh, you just had the most insecure

2771
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:25,480
system ever, blah, blah, blah.

2772
02:24:25,480 --> 02:24:26,880
Oh, here's a promotion.

2773
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:31,760
But really, the fact is that Akira Sato retired.

2774
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:37,640
So that's why they're shoving people up.

2775
02:24:37,640 --> 02:24:40,520
We knew there was going to be a management shakeup coming, though, after everything that

2776
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:41,520
they went through the past few months.

2777
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:44,000
But I thought it would be deserved firings.

2778
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Sackings.

2779
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:50,200
I like the word sacking a little more.

2780
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:51,200
The people have been sacked.

2781
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,800
I would like them to be rendered redundant.

2782
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:54,640
All right, moving on.

2783
02:24:54,640 --> 02:24:57,520
Loki, what do you got for us?

2784
02:24:57,520 --> 02:24:58,720
We were talking...

2785
02:24:58,720 --> 02:25:00,760
You're watching the Giggling Girls video, aren't you?

2786
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:01,760
Yes, I am.

2787
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:02,760
It looks like it's...

2788
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:03,760
Oh my god, it's so awesome!

2789
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:06,400
Oh my god, it's GLaDOS, oh my god!

2790
02:25:06,400 --> 02:25:09,920
And now for two Giggling Schoolgirls.

2791
02:25:09,920 --> 02:25:12,560
By the way, that is the third podcast that OLR is working on.

2792
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:14,120
It's Giggling Girls playing video games.

2793
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:15,120
I'm just kidding.

2794
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:18,040
Wouldn't that be the Giggling Lesbian Show?

2795
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:20,560
I wish, if they still lived here.

2796
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:21,560
Anyways.

2797
02:25:21,560 --> 02:25:32,600
The PSP remaster titles that were announced during both E3 and at their own events, they're

2798
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:38,280
basically able to do this because of the help of a PSP engine, a software development kit

2799
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:45,720
that Sony put out regarding these PSP remaster titles that allows them to be able to port

2800
02:25:45,720 --> 02:25:47,720
them into HD.

2801
02:25:47,720 --> 02:25:54,640
And with high-resolution rendering, stereoscopic 3D, and wireless controller support for Dual

2802
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:55,640
Shock 3.

2803
02:25:55,640 --> 02:26:00,540
And apparently, they haven't announced any more remaster titles other than Monster Hunter

2804
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:06,000
Portable III, and then also, of course, there's, I mean, they call it the remaster title, but

2805
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:12,760
the God of War Origins collection, which is coming out, that's basically the two PSP God

2806
02:26:12,760 --> 02:26:16,360
of War games.

2807
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:20,120
But yeah, it looks like we're going to see a lot more of these, because they've run out

2808
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:22,120
of ideas.

2809
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:23,760
Funny!

2810
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:27,320
Sorry, I'm slow.

2811
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:30,360
I'm chatting with listeners about Final Fantasy XIII.

2812
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:34,640
We're talking about what parties we use, and they're telling me that, somebody, who's telling

2813
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:40,000
me that they use, Dungeon Buster is saying, I think it's lightning saws and vanilla, I'm

2814
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,000
like, who do you have as a sentinel?

2815
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,440
Because you don't have a sentinel in that party.

2816
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:46,040
Like, you have to have Fang or Snow, and I don't use Snow because he's a whiny vagina,

2817
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:49,680
but I like Fang, because she's hardcore, so I use her as my sentinel.

2818
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:50,680
Anyway.

2819
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:54,040
Oh yeah, PSP remasters, cool, cool deal.

2820
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:55,840
Any of those worth getting, you think?

2821
02:26:55,840 --> 02:27:03,280
Um, I didn't really play Monster Hunter, and God of War, I don't know, God of War would

2822
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:05,180
be fun to play, I guess.

2823
02:27:05,180 --> 02:27:09,760
I haven't really played in, I only think I went through all the way in two.

2824
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:16,120
I know I didn't play all the way through in one because my, it glitched out of me in one,

2825
02:27:16,120 --> 02:27:21,120
the very last boss.

2826
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:29,520
Going on to anticipated games, Gears of War 3 has leaked to the internet already, uh oh,

2827
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:34,200
this is a, not a finalized build by the way, but it does have the full campaign and there

2828
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:36,060
are some multiplayer modes.

2829
02:27:36,060 --> 02:27:39,800
This could be the E3 build of the game, but not sure.

2830
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:43,880
They say it's a developer build, or what they call, oh and you've heard this term on the

2831
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:46,420
show before, a JTAG version of the game.

2832
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:49,880
You may need a special modified Xbox 360 or dev kit to run it.

2833
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:50,880
It's a developer.

2834
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:55,680
But Loki would never indulge in that, because that would be wrong to download that and play

2835
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:56,680
that.

2836
02:27:56,680 --> 02:28:02,720
Yes, that would be wrong, and it's a developer version of the game, because JTAGs basically

2837
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:06,240
can operate like a developer's console.

2838
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:09,720
I have a dev kit too, so that'd be.

2839
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:14,920
So if you're trying to keep yourself spoiler free on Gears of War 3 stories, you might

2840
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:15,920
want to leave the internet.

2841
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:19,620
Yeah, you might want to take a break from the internet for about six months, or whenever

2842
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:21,280
this game is supposed to come out.

2843
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:22,800
Uh, yeah, careful.

2844
02:28:22,800 --> 02:28:29,760
Because they do have, I mean they have a bunch of different, I guess, builds in here.

2845
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:34,800
Uh, they have like a testing, shipping, release, and then multiplayer.

2846
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:38,920
So they're testing a bunch of different things.

2847
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:40,960
By the way, I love having a podcast.

2848
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:41,960
Can I just say that?

2849
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:42,960
I love this.

2850
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:45,720
Like, you know, I was just bitching a minute ago that I'm not playing Civ World, and one

2851
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:48,560
listener just said, oh, there's an invite in your inbox now.

2852
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:49,560
Awwww.

2853
02:28:49,560 --> 02:28:51,560
Love the internet.

2854
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:53,160
Love it.

2855
02:28:53,160 --> 02:28:54,160
I love it.

2856
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:55,680
I wish Google Plus had been that easy.

2857
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:59,120
If I didn't invite you, like, during that 90 minute window that one night, you got screwed.

2858
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:00,320
I didn't get my invite.

2859
02:29:00,320 --> 02:29:01,840
I know, because they shut it off.

2860
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:04,400
Like, I cannot invite people now to Google Plus.

2861
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:06,000
Fucking retarded.

2862
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,080
It'll be, it'll be opened up soon.

2863
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:09,080
For others.

2864
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:10,080
We'll see.

2865
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:12,760
Uh, there's not a lot on there right now.

2866
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:15,860
It's just, you know, yay, I'm on Google Plus and it's not Facebook.

2867
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:18,520
Like that's what every status update I see on there is right now.

2868
02:29:18,520 --> 02:29:21,160
Hey, it's not Facebook.

2869
02:29:21,160 --> 02:29:26,200
Also it's not Facebook, but is ten times more awesome is our mailbag.

2870
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:28,620
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

2871
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:32,520
Every week DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and dives in and reads some emails.

2872
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:36,280
She's gonna share them with you right now if she can stop playing on Tumblr.

2873
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:39,360
I'm putting something important to other artists on there.

2874
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:42,040
Well, I will tell you what it is, because it's actually pretty cool.

2875
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:50,240
The iCloud logo is actually using the golden ratio, um, as its design background, so anyway.

2876
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:51,240
Nyeh.

2877
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:52,240
It's important.

2878
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:53,240
See?

2879
02:29:53,240 --> 02:29:54,240
People like circles.

2880
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:55,240
Okay.

2881
02:29:55,240 --> 02:30:00,800
This one is from Robbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb, it's called Implications of Brown vs. EMA Ruling.

2882
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:02,480
You'll talk the subject to death this week.

2883
02:30:02,480 --> 02:30:06,760
I find whenever I try to explain this to a non-gamer, they not only don't care, but they

2884
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:08,880
think it doesn't affect them.

2885
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:12,720
Every time they play Solitaire, Farmville, Bejeweled, take an online test, give games

2886
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:17,080
to their kids, or anything else software related, they're doing so without fear of breaking

2887
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:19,240
a bunch of state-by-state laws.

2888
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:23,640
Soon we won't do anything without some sort of interactive media, be it a question or

2889
02:30:23,640 --> 02:30:24,640
a controller.

2890
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,240
It affects everyone in the USA.

2891
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:30,200
My two bits without repeating a story, Robbbbbbbbbbbb.

2892
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:33,920
I've given him some more bubbas.

2893
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:35,000
And okay.

2894
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:40,680
There is, uh, a couple, actually one from Game Politics, another story that he linked,

2895
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:44,120
about Star Wars Galaxies players filing a class action lawsuit.

2896
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:45,400
Wow, really?

2897
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:49,480
I want to know more about that, actually, because the game is shutting down soon, right?

2898
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:50,480
Yeah.

2899
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:51,480
So they're filing class action lawsuits?

2900
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:52,480
Why?

2901
02:30:52,480 --> 02:30:55,880
It's one of the lifetime subscriptions, isn't it?

2902
02:30:55,880 --> 02:31:00,880
So basically it says that more than 50 Star Wars Galaxies players are filing a class action

2903
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:07,960
lawsuit against Sony, and there are a bunch of other players that says that they will

2904
02:31:07,960 --> 02:31:14,600
do the same thing, um, because Sony is shutting down, they basically are having, you know,

2905
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:18,680
their petitions go up, but the problem is that they agreed that Sony could cancel the

2906
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:20,520
game at any time.

2907
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:23,800
So uh, they're SOL.

2908
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:28,120
I'm pretty sure that's in the terms of service for any MMO, even Warcraft.

2909
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:29,800
They can pull the plug at any time.

2910
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:31,840
Remember Warcraft shut down in China for four months?

2911
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:32,840
That could happen here.

2912
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:33,840
Yeah.

2913
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:34,840
It won't, but it could.

2914
02:31:34,840 --> 02:31:43,720
Well, also, um, about the whole Resident Evil mercenaries, basically, um, Amazon customers

2915
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:50,040
are actually putting like huge, huge negative reviews on Amazon.

2916
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:54,640
Like there is one person saying, I don't care how much fun this game is or how good it looks

2917
02:31:54,640 --> 02:31:56,200
or how much it costs.

2918
02:31:56,200 --> 02:31:57,760
There's one save slot.

2919
02:31:57,760 --> 02:31:59,840
Save data is permanent and cannot be deleted.

2920
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:04,040
Capcom is attempting to set a new precedent and consumer manipulation and control with

2921
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:07,280
this product.

2922
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:11,360
Yes.

2923
02:32:11,360 --> 02:32:17,880
And then, um, dear Sakura, Loki and Roger.

2924
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:21,960
Roar, this is Roger Roberts.

2925
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:28,520
This, this week a game company did slash said slash didn't do slash didn't say something.

2926
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:31,400
This thing is the worst thing in the history of the world and ever.

2927
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:32,400
That's bad.

2928
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:33,400
Roar.

2929
02:32:33,400 --> 02:32:34,400
112.

2930
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:37,060
Stay black for entertainment.

2931
02:32:37,060 --> 02:32:40,920
This message has been brought to you by corn corn, great addition to tacos, bad addition

2932
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:41,920
to Silent Hill.

2933
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:46,480
After all, adding corn to tacos has never caused haze.

2934
02:32:46,480 --> 02:32:48,880
Not for my iPad.

2935
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:50,920
I'm allergic to corn of all kinds.

2936
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:54,160
So I'm assuming my name got auto corrected to Roger.

2937
02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:56,040
No cause Julian called you Roger.

2938
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:58,280
Oh, he said happy birthday Roger.

2939
02:32:58,280 --> 02:32:59,280
That's right.

2940
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:00,280
Happy.

2941
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:01,280
That's right.

2942
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:02,280
I remember now.

2943
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:03,280
Shit, I forgot to bring back the cake plate.

2944
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:04,280
God damn it.

2945
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:05,760
Which by the way, a certain someone is listening right now.

2946
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:06,760
Hi.

2947
02:33:06,760 --> 02:33:10,320
Oh, I hope, I hope the four year old's not listening with all our potty mouth language.

2948
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:15,360
Didn't you say you wanted to say something to...

2949
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:16,680
I said it on Facebook.

2950
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:17,680
Okay.

2951
02:33:17,680 --> 02:33:18,680
Take care of that.

2952
02:33:18,680 --> 02:33:19,680
Okay.

2953
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:20,680
I didn't know you wanted to say something publicly.

2954
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:21,680
Well thank you for the cake.

2955
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:22,680
I think I expressed that last week.

2956
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:23,680
Sorry.

2957
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:24,680
No, no, no.

2958
02:33:24,680 --> 02:33:25,680
It's fine.

2959
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:26,680
Nah.

2960
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:27,680
Okay.

2961
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:28,680
This is from Chiggers, which that's the worst nickname ever.

2962
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:29,680
Okay.

2963
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:30,680
I'm sorry.

2964
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:31,680
No, I love that nickname.

2965
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:32,680
Do you know what, do you know what those are?

2966
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:33,680
Uh oh.

2967
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:34,680
Is this something really...

2968
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:39,040
They're bugs that burrow under your skin and lay their eggs and infect under your skin

2969
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:43,320
and then the eggs hatch and they come out of your skin leaving these weird zombie like

2970
02:33:43,320 --> 02:33:44,480
trails on your arms.

2971
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:46,320
I've seen it happen.

2972
02:33:46,320 --> 02:33:47,320
That's kind of awesome actually.

2973
02:33:47,320 --> 02:33:48,320
It's really disgusting.

2974
02:33:48,320 --> 02:33:52,700
Um, dear OLR, long time listener, six years, first time emailer.

2975
02:33:52,700 --> 02:33:58,540
By the way, hearts, I've noticed PS3 is now starting to put out TurboGrafx-16 games.

2976
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:02,680
Do you think it's possible they may try and get some games that were released out on the

2977
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:06,280
NES or Saturn from any third party publishers?

2978
02:34:06,280 --> 02:34:08,920
Keep up the good work and belated happy ninth anniversary.

2979
02:34:08,920 --> 02:34:12,080
Yours truly in Hoard House, Gildy, Chiggers.

2980
02:34:12,080 --> 02:34:15,520
I really hope that you didn't name yourself after a bug that lays skin and...

2981
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:17,000
I kind of hope you did.

2982
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:21,320
Lays eggs in your skin and explodes everywhere into red bloody masses.

2983
02:34:21,320 --> 02:34:24,360
And Becky says she has no idea why Julian called you Roger.

2984
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:27,120
Cause kids get confused sometimes.

2985
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:28,120
He was nice.

2986
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:29,120
It's cute.

2987
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:30,120
Four year olds can get away with it cause it's cute.

2988
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:32,120
And then he screamed.

2989
02:34:32,120 --> 02:34:40,400
Anyhow, as far as the whole PlayStation 3 TurboGrafx-16 games, no, they will not get games on the

2990
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:42,320
NES, SNES, or any of that because that talks...

2991
02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:43,920
Even if they were third party.

2992
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:47,800
Even if they were third party because you're emulating the hardware that doesn't belong.

2993
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:50,400
And so I think the whole licensing and all that would be...

2994
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:54,180
I mean they would have to completely redo the game.

2995
02:34:54,180 --> 02:34:55,180
Completely redo it.

2996
02:34:55,180 --> 02:34:56,180
And I just don't see that happening.

2997
02:34:56,180 --> 02:34:57,180
They're not gonna.

2998
02:34:57,180 --> 02:34:58,180
Yeah.

2999
02:34:58,180 --> 02:35:01,500
I mean never say never just like Nintendo, herp-a-derp.

3000
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:06,320
It would be hilarious if they did Saturn games on a PlayStation at all.

3001
02:35:06,320 --> 02:35:09,120
That would just be lol.

3002
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:11,960
Cause the big competition was the Saturn and PlayStation back in the day.

3003
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:14,960
Or what about PlayStation games on a Dreamcast?

3004
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:18,200
That I have three video games that I can play on my Dreamcast.

3005
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:19,200
That's the joke.

3006
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:20,200
Was it what?

3007
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:21,200
It was Tekken and Crazy Taxi.

3008
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:23,840
Tekken 3 and Crazy Taxi and Metal Gear.

3009
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:24,840
Metal Gear Solid.

3010
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:25,840
Was it really?

3011
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:26,840
Yes it was.

3012
02:35:26,840 --> 02:35:27,840
That was all Bleemcast by the way.

3013
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:28,840
They were Bleemcast.

3014
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:33,880
I remember when I tried to run Bleem on my PC, granted this was way back in the day and

3015
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:35,160
that did not work.

3016
02:35:35,160 --> 02:35:39,760
I remember when I had an emulator that worked better than Bleem.

3017
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:44,080
And we were trying to play Street Fighter EX3.

3018
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:47,560
That was lolsy cause it still ran like crap.

3019
02:35:47,560 --> 02:35:48,560
But yeah.

3020
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:51,520
Tekken actually did look a lot better on Dreamcast.

3021
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:53,040
Just saying.

3022
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:54,480
That's it.

3023
02:35:54,480 --> 02:35:55,480
Email us.

3024
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:57,240
Mailbag at OrangelaungeRadio.com.

3025
02:35:57,240 --> 02:35:59,280
Make Dark Sakura work more next week.

3026
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:00,280
Send us more emails.

3027
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:02,160
Mailbag at OrangelaungeRadio.com.

3028
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:06,960
Meanwhile, we do a segment here every week on the show that sometimes has to do with

3029
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:07,960
video games.

3030
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:08,960
Sometimes not.

3031
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:09,960
Why?

3032
02:36:09,960 --> 02:36:10,960
Because we can.

3033
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:15,960
FUs of the Week!

3034
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:30,160
FU to everybody who's eating at Wendy's today, Rob.

3035
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:31,160
Haters gonna hate.

3036
02:36:31,160 --> 02:36:33,000
For not bringing me a Frosty.

3037
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,600
Cause I wanted a Frosty all day.

3038
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:38,160
I didn't get a Frosty, but the berry tea was very good.

3039
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:39,160
I'm not gonna lie.

3040
02:36:39,160 --> 02:36:41,040
I even told my husband to go get me a Frosty.

3041
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:42,040
And you know what he did?

3042
02:36:42,040 --> 02:36:44,160
He went across the street and got a hamburger.

3043
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:46,960
And then he brought me one and I just had a hot dog.

3044
02:36:46,960 --> 02:36:48,680
Oh, from your neighbors that are cooking?

3045
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:49,680
Yes.

3046
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:50,680
We're doing our barbecue tomorrow.

3047
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:53,920
You did tell the neighbors it's July 3rd, right?

3048
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:56,680
No one cur.

3049
02:36:56,680 --> 02:36:58,560
FU to Wendy's for sucking.

3050
02:36:58,560 --> 02:36:59,560
Hey.

3051
02:36:59,560 --> 02:37:01,560
Cause they have terrible food.

3052
02:37:01,560 --> 02:37:08,760
Somebody sent me a coupon for free Frosty since you gave Rob a Civ beta thing.

3053
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:11,760
One of them is game related, the other is not.

3054
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:12,760
Don't care.

3055
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:13,760
I want a Frosty.

3056
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:14,760
Frosty's the best thing ever.

3057
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:18,000
Do you know what Miek Latov tried to convince me was a good idea once?

3058
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:19,480
Dipping your french fries into your Frosty?

3059
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:21,960
No, dipping chicken McNuggets into Frosty.

3060
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:22,960
Gross.

3061
02:37:22,960 --> 02:37:23,960
The Wendy's don't have McNuggets.

3062
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:24,960
There's people that love that.

3063
02:37:24,960 --> 02:37:25,960
You know what I mean?

3064
02:37:25,960 --> 02:37:26,960
Like chocolate shakes.

3065
02:37:26,960 --> 02:37:27,960
And Rob?

3066
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:28,960
What?

3067
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:29,960
It's gross.

3068
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:34,400
I was gonna say Miek Latov, hey, I don't know if he's still working, no you don't still

3069
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:35,400
work in Gamestop.

3070
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:37,800
No, he definitely does not work in Gamestop.

3071
02:37:37,800 --> 02:37:44,520
I need the DLC for Earth Defense Force, I need to pick up that pre-order shit somewhere.

3072
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:45,520
Ask the listeners.

3073
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:48,640
Someone sent me the DLC for Earth Defense Force.

3074
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:49,880
And you will give them?

3075
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:50,880
Nothing.

3076
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:51,880
A high-five.

3077
02:37:51,880 --> 02:37:52,880
A handshake.

3078
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:53,880
Can't even do that.

3079
02:37:53,880 --> 02:38:04,360
Alright, my F.U. of the week goes to, this is a work-related F.U. because I don't want

3080
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:06,520
people thinking it has to do with other things.

3081
02:38:06,520 --> 02:38:07,520
It's work-related.

3082
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:11,160
F.U. to surprises.

3083
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:12,160
Work-related surprises.

3084
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:15,480
Alright, that's really it.

3085
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:18,000
Otherwise things are actually pretty good.

3086
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:19,000
Let's move on.

3087
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Yeah.

3088
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:27,360
So, this is kind of neat, I mean, unexpected, I guess, because life goes on, I guess.

3089
02:38:27,360 --> 02:38:31,800
But, Tokyo Game Show's gonna have a pretty good showing this year.

3090
02:38:31,800 --> 02:38:38,200
They're up to 146 exhibitors over the 138 in 2010, and of course people are like, ah,

3091
02:38:38,200 --> 02:38:43,120
you know, earthquake, and old developers, ah, they, you know, suffered from it.

3092
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:49,480
I mean, it's been, it's gonna be a while, and you know what, life does go on, you know,

3093
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:54,880
so it's gonna be up, they're expecting to see, I guess, or they're gonna try to reduce

3094
02:38:54,880 --> 02:38:58,200
the power usage during the show.

3095
02:38:58,200 --> 02:39:05,520
They're gonna drop it down 25% versus 2010 as well, and, but overall it's gonna have

3096
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:07,960
a really good showing.

3097
02:39:07,960 --> 02:39:12,320
So it's pretty cool.

3098
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:16,540
That's great that it seems like it's gonna be such a big, big show, and just, it's great

3099
02:39:16,540 --> 02:39:19,800
that they're kind of bouncing with all that recovery stuff, so I'm very happy to hear

3100
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:21,360
it, actually.

3101
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:24,120
So there you go.

3102
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:30,000
Moving on to one last story here about music, music-related stuff.

3103
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:33,680
First off, if you didn't already know about this, I imagine most of you listeners already

3104
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:38,320
have downloaded this and put them on their iPods, but if you are the one that has not,

3105
02:39:38,320 --> 02:39:45,160
more Portal 2 free music is now available, volume 2 of the Songs to Test by, 18 new tracks,

3106
02:39:45,160 --> 02:39:48,280
14 ringtones for your iPhone and Android devices.

3107
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:50,280
I had no idea that there were ringtones in there.

3108
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:52,680
I need to look more carefully at this stuff.

3109
02:39:52,680 --> 02:39:53,680
You can check that out.

3110
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:59,360
New songs include Bring Your Daughter to Work Day, I Am Not a Moron, and Potatoes Lament.

3111
02:39:59,360 --> 02:40:00,620
Which is actually really cool.

3112
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:04,040
You can also have the orange or blue Portal sound as your messaging ringtone.

3113
02:40:04,040 --> 02:40:05,040
So like, I would love...

3114
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:06,040
Unless you have an iPhone.

3115
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:07,040
Don't you wanna have your...

3116
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:08,040
Oh, really?

3117
02:40:08,040 --> 02:40:09,040
It doesn't work on iPhone?

3118
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:10,480
Because you can't change your iPhone sounds for your messages.

3119
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:11,480
That's why I didn't notice it.

3120
02:40:11,480 --> 02:40:12,480
Yes, you can.

3121
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:13,480
You can.

3122
02:40:13,480 --> 02:40:14,480
For messages?

3123
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:15,480
For messages?

3124
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:17,760
Only for the ones that they put on your phone.

3125
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:18,760
Oh, yeah.

3126
02:40:18,760 --> 02:40:20,760
Yeah, that's true.

3127
02:40:20,760 --> 02:40:21,760
Yeah.

3128
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:25,520
Volume 3 is coming soon.

3129
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:26,520
How soon?

3130
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:28,880
I said soon.

3131
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:33,320
Also in music-related news, another Rockman Arrange album, of course you know that, here's

3132
02:40:33,320 --> 02:40:42,480
Mega Man, Rockman Unity announced a new Rockman Arrange soundtrack.

3133
02:40:42,480 --> 02:40:46,440
We Are Rockman is the...Rockman, excuse me, is the podcast.

3134
02:40:46,440 --> 02:40:54,680
It includes Mashihiro Aoki on guitar, Yasumasa Kitagawa on bass.

3135
02:40:54,680 --> 02:40:57,520
He did work on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom All-Stars.

3136
02:40:57,520 --> 02:41:04,920
Mitsuhiko Bleep Bleep Boop Bloop Maestro Takano on drums, and there will be some guest musicians

3137
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:05,920
as well.

3138
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:09,400
Otherwise, we don't have a lot of details about the album, but basically Capcom's greats

3139
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:12,360
are getting together to do some Rockman Arrange music.

3140
02:41:12,360 --> 02:41:13,360
Gotta be cool.

3141
02:41:13,360 --> 02:41:16,280
That kind of sounds like what the Black Mages did for Final Fantasy.

3142
02:41:16,280 --> 02:41:17,960
That's kind of what that sounds like to me.

3143
02:41:17,960 --> 02:41:19,760
So there you go.

3144
02:41:19,760 --> 02:41:22,160
Alright, that does it for gaming news tonight.

3145
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:23,280
We're done.

3146
02:41:23,280 --> 02:41:24,280
We're out of here.

3147
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:26,720
But not until we open up the Skype line and take some calls.

3148
02:41:26,720 --> 02:41:29,440
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.

3149
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:31,800
Give us a call and you can talk with us.

3150
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:34,680
We can talk about any of the stories we talked about tonight, or maybe we missed something

3151
02:41:34,680 --> 02:41:36,280
that you wanted to talk about.

3152
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:40,240
Do you want to talk about Nintendo and the localization, or maybe you want to talk more

3153
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:44,160
about, I don't know, Minecraft or Gears of War 3 leaking, whatever you want to talk about,

3154
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:45,160
give us a call.

3155
02:41:45,160 --> 02:41:49,400
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.

3156
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:52,800
In the meantime, you know I'm going to ask Loki if there's any last minute stories.

3157
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:58,480
So apparently, because to celebrate Independence Day, you can now dress up your avatar on Xbox

3158
02:41:58,480 --> 02:42:00,760
360 as a Confederate soldier.

3159
02:42:00,760 --> 02:42:01,760
Awesome.

3160
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:03,760
Oh boy.

3161
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:06,440
Go south.

3162
02:42:06,440 --> 02:42:10,160
I don't know, that's kind of weird.

3163
02:42:10,160 --> 02:42:14,440
Not at all a bad thing.

3164
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:19,760
What do you mean that they, oh, but ok, it's just like you do the right combination of

3165
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:20,760
hats and gear.

3166
02:42:20,760 --> 02:42:24,440
No, they have Civil War uniform, 160 Microsoft points.

3167
02:42:24,440 --> 02:42:25,440
Really?

3168
02:42:25,440 --> 02:42:26,440
Interesting.

3169
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:29,480
I mean, but you could do also, you know, the other stuff.

3170
02:42:29,480 --> 02:42:36,000
They have also, you know, some funny hats, because everyone loves funny hats.

3171
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,400
I love funny hats.

3172
02:42:37,400 --> 02:42:42,960
It'd just be weird though, like, since a lot of that DLC doesn't translate over though

3173
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:47,640
into games, it would still be funny like playing, you know, seeing it or something like that

3174
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:51,680
with a civil, you know, a Confederate soldier or something.

3175
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:54,120
Anything else in last minute news tonight?

3176
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:55,120
Uhhhhh.

3177
02:42:55,120 --> 02:42:59,680
Earth Defense Force is awesome.

3178
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:01,960
I actually watched you playing that a little bit over there.

3179
02:43:01,960 --> 02:43:03,240
It's really hard.

3180
02:43:03,240 --> 02:43:06,160
It seriously, and I'm only playing it easy.

3181
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:11,160
Apparently if you play the harder difficulties, you can turn your AI bots off.

3182
02:43:11,160 --> 02:43:12,480
I don't even want to know.

3183
02:43:12,480 --> 02:43:16,760
It's just, and then once you beat the game, they also have campaign remix where you can

3184
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:19,800
play with different enemies spawning.

3185
02:43:19,800 --> 02:43:22,080
So it's got a lot of gameplay built in there.

3186
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:27,040
I'm sorry if I'm just ranting about this game, but it's just, it's worth picking up.

3187
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:29,640
You are a little bit, but it's fine.

3188
02:43:29,640 --> 02:43:30,640
We all knew this would happen.

3189
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:32,680
You've been talking about this game for like a year.

3190
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:33,680
Exactly.

3191
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:35,400
Just you wait until Saints Row 3 comes out.

3192
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:39,320
I mean, you think this is bad, oh no, not even close.

3193
02:43:39,320 --> 02:43:42,400
I actually kind of want to be there when you're playing Saints Row 3 for the first time.

3194
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:43,400
It is gonna be just...

3195
02:43:43,400 --> 02:43:47,280
Like, I don't know how I can do that, but I need, we need to have a Saints Row 3 party.

3196
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:48,520
It's gonna be fucking nuts.

3197
02:43:48,520 --> 02:43:50,280
Okay, so here's something we can talk about.

3198
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:53,480
You can stream it on the internet except, oh shit, we would be breaking the law.

3199
02:43:53,480 --> 02:43:56,960
1877 Game O.L.R., username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio if you want to give us a call.

3200
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:59,200
Bunchy Aerospace was finally announced what that is.

3201
02:43:59,200 --> 02:44:03,400
It's a partnership program with social and mobile devs where they're basically gonna

3202
02:44:03,400 --> 02:44:13,260
help either publish, promote, or, you know, draw interest for different games that are

3203
02:44:13,260 --> 02:44:16,960
coming out on these platforms where they may not get as much interest.

3204
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:18,280
So that's kind of cool.

3205
02:44:18,280 --> 02:44:24,040
Unfortunately, they will not be building spaceships as not part of the aerospace program.

3206
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:25,040
Let's go to the phones.

3207
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:26,040
We have a call.

3208
02:44:26,040 --> 02:44:27,040
1877 Game O.L.R.

3209
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:28,040
after this is done.

3210
02:44:28,040 --> 02:44:29,040
Hi, OrangeLawnsRadio.

3211
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:30,040
Who's this?

3212
02:44:30,040 --> 02:44:31,040
Hi.

3213
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:32,040
Pleasure, Zaku here.

3214
02:44:32,040 --> 02:44:33,040
Hi, Zaku.

3215
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:36,480
I'm just trying to recover before tomorrow and everything.

3216
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:38,680
Well tomorrow is when the real parties are supposed to happen.

3217
02:44:38,680 --> 02:44:39,680
What not?

3218
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:40,680
What?

3219
02:44:40,680 --> 02:44:42,680
Tomorrow is when the real parties are supposed to happen.

3220
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:44,080
I don't know.

3221
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:46,160
Just like a barbecue at my place at home.

3222
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:47,160
Oh, okay.

3223
02:44:47,160 --> 02:44:50,320
That and trying to go out with this girl tomorrow.

3224
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:51,320
Well I hope he gets some.

3225
02:44:51,320 --> 02:44:52,320
What's on your mind tonight?

3226
02:44:52,320 --> 02:44:53,880
Uh, nothing much.

3227
02:44:53,880 --> 02:45:01,920
Just like trying to lament over the fallout of, you know, what transpired last week with

3228
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:07,800
the whole Supreme Court decision, which I know you probably covered in great detail

3229
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:09,160
before this call.

3230
02:45:09,160 --> 02:45:11,700
We did, but what are your thoughts?

3231
02:45:11,700 --> 02:45:12,700
I don't know.

3232
02:45:12,700 --> 02:45:17,640
On one hand, it's like they're grasping at straws and trying to legislate something that's

3233
02:45:17,640 --> 02:45:21,720
already been declared protected speech for all intents and purposes.

3234
02:45:21,720 --> 02:45:28,600
So it's like the people who were, you know, the ones who pushed the, you know, the particular

3235
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:33,480
person that pushed the law and, you know, and actually got the law, you know, introduced

3236
02:45:33,480 --> 02:45:39,920
the law and got it passed, well he's, he's, he's basically not giving up in that sense.

3237
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:45,120
He thinks he can wrangle his way through the constitution when it's pretty clear, even,

3238
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:48,920
you know, it's pretty clear that, you know, when you ban something like this, that's no

3239
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:52,960
matter, no matter if you put lipstick on, on that same bill, it's still going to be

3240
02:45:52,960 --> 02:45:56,160
unconstitutional because they've already...

3241
02:45:56,160 --> 02:46:02,080
Well, but what about how there were a couple justices that basically said, you can regulate

3242
02:46:02,080 --> 02:46:03,480
games just not like this.

3243
02:46:03,480 --> 02:46:06,720
That's maybe leaving the door wide open for somebody else.

3244
02:46:06,720 --> 02:46:12,240
I know it's, some have said it's a 5-4 split in reality because two of them concurred with

3245
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:16,480
the, you know, two of the other justices concurred with Scalia.

3246
02:46:16,480 --> 02:46:17,480
Right.

3247
02:46:17,480 --> 02:46:18,480
Yeah.

3248
02:46:18,480 --> 02:46:22,400
So it's basically, it's like they weren't, they weren't for it, but at the same time

3249
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:23,920
they were in between.

3250
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:30,960
So it wasn't like, you know, if you really get, if you really go deep into that decision,

3251
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:36,200
there's not that much, there's only like a, you know, a thin, you know, a thin margin

3252
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:39,600
of just prevail, of prevailing opinion.

3253
02:46:39,600 --> 02:46:40,600
What do you think about this?

3254
02:46:40,600 --> 02:46:43,800
Something that's just like, that it barely got through.

3255
02:46:43,800 --> 02:46:46,900
Let me quickly ask you, what'd you think about this other bill we spent some time talking

3256
02:46:46,900 --> 02:46:51,640
about tonight, the whole, you know, no more streaming of movies and games and so forth?

3257
02:46:51,640 --> 02:46:56,960
Oh, that one is, that one right there, that's a landmine.

3258
02:46:56,960 --> 02:47:02,080
I'm pretty sure if it ever comes to court, it's going to, one way or another will know

3259
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:04,080
what impact it has.

3260
02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:06,680
Right now it's very murky.

3261
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:09,680
And you're just waiting, and they're just waiting, you know, the feds are just waiting

3262
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:11,400
to at least use it on something.

3263
02:47:11,400 --> 02:47:16,400
I can't wait for the 12 year old- Some guy just like leaking a trailer on YouTube

3264
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:20,040
or just posting up a gameplay, gameplay footage.

3265
02:47:20,040 --> 02:47:26,360
And for some reason, you know, some, some video game company, which doesn't, you know,

3266
02:47:26,360 --> 02:47:29,560
which took offense to that whole act, will stick the feds on him.

3267
02:47:29,560 --> 02:47:30,560
Think about it.

3268
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:35,160
I can't wait for the 10 year old to get sued for posting a YouTube of her singing-

3269
02:47:35,160 --> 02:47:36,160
That's the thing, it's not even sued.

3270
02:47:36,160 --> 02:47:39,600
He's actually, you're going to see federal agents roll up in his house.

3271
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:45,600
Singing Lady Gaga's Born This Way, when Lady Gaga herself loves that shit and posts about

3272
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:46,600
it to Twitter.

3273
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:50,600
There's some 10 year old girl that she invited on stage with her because she loved watching

3274
02:47:50,600 --> 02:47:51,880
her YouTube performance.

3275
02:47:51,880 --> 02:47:55,520
I understand, but guess who owns, still has control of the music.

3276
02:47:55,520 --> 02:48:01,200
No, I get it, but I mean if I- The label, remember, Lady Gaga's only one person that

3277
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:06,520
until she's met the, until she's already honored the contract with her label, she doesn't own

3278
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:08,000
her music.

3279
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,760
She's a slave, just like Prince was, hence the symbol.

3280
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:11,760
Exactly.

3281
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:14,920
And that's the thing, unless you own your master tracks and you can take them anywhere

3282
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:21,680
else, then you have control of it, otherwise you've already sold your soul to the label

3283
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:25,360
and they'll be the ones taking the feds on that 10 year old kid.

3284
02:48:25,360 --> 02:48:28,640
All right, any other quick thoughts before we let you go and get another call?

3285
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:36,120
Yeah, take advantage of these sales right now on the sites of Amazon, Steam in particular.

3286
02:48:36,120 --> 02:48:38,920
Lot of really good stuff to be had right now.

3287
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:42,560
Great FYI in chat from William Murderface, always love that name.

3288
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:46,600
Oh, if anyone's looking for a Diablo 2 fix and does not have Torchlight, it's on sale

3289
02:48:46,600 --> 02:48:48,400
for $2.99 on Steam today.

3290
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:51,520
That's a $3 game, I'm thinking about it right now.

3291
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:57,120
If you even remotely like Diablo or Diablo 2, you will get $3 worth out of Torchlight.

3292
02:48:57,120 --> 02:49:04,560
But I played that game years ago, all I remember is just mashing my mouse, just click mashing.

3293
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:09,640
It's very much a dungeon, well here's the great thing, do you have a 360?

3294
02:49:09,640 --> 02:49:12,160
Yes, but I- Go download the demo.

3295
02:49:12,160 --> 02:49:15,960
I want to just do it from my end, I want to keep it old school.

3296
02:49:15,960 --> 02:49:17,880
We can at least download the demo to see what the game's like, all right.

3297
02:49:17,880 --> 02:49:20,840
I gotta let you go to get more calls, take care buddy.

3298
02:49:20,840 --> 02:49:24,680
I think Torchlight's a great deal, but yeah, it's a dungeon crawler, so I don't know if

3299
02:49:24,680 --> 02:49:29,040
you aren't into the dungeon crawlers, you may not like it, but we'll see.

3300
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:30,920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3301
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:33,040
Hey, it's Ronmo, what's up everyone?

3302
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:35,360
Not much, you know, just hanging.

3303
02:49:35,360 --> 02:49:39,800
Chilling, smoking a little, you know- Doing a show.

3304
02:49:39,800 --> 02:49:42,000
Smoking a J, no I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding, we don't do that.

3305
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:45,320
Oh, pass it over this way, man, it's the fourth.

3306
02:49:45,320 --> 02:49:50,400
What's on your mind- Yes, I can think of no better way on spending Independence Day than

3307
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:57,520
burning various things, including fireworks, our money, and a J.

3308
02:49:57,520 --> 02:50:00,920
I'm not gonna complain, so it works for me.

3309
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:04,360
Only in America will we celebrate fire, what's on your mind?

3310
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:09,240
I have this one question, I've been meaning to ask you guys this for long, so I keep forgetting.

3311
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:10,240
The answer is no.

3312
02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:13,240
God damn it, Ron!

3313
02:50:13,240 --> 02:50:14,880
What's the question, I'm kidding.

3314
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:21,360
Okay, now back at E3, Konami had announced that they were re-releasing, I believe, Zoner

3315
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:26,360
the Enders and Silent Hill as the collectors of all the games together?

3316
02:50:26,360 --> 02:50:27,360
Correct.

3317
02:50:27,360 --> 02:50:28,360
Yes.

3318
02:50:28,360 --> 02:50:33,600
Now we had a discussion about that on Twitter, half of us are saying that Konami pretty much

3319
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:37,480
turned their back on the fans, they're just looking for a quick pop.

3320
02:50:37,480 --> 02:50:42,960
The other half are saying Konami is doing this to garner interest into the series to

3321
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:46,080
see if it's worth another game.

3322
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:48,680
What do you think?

3323
02:50:48,680 --> 02:50:51,000
I think it's a little bit of both, to be honest.

3324
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:56,480
I think it's, you know, why not make a little more cash on games that were previously out,

3325
02:50:56,480 --> 02:50:59,960
although they are having to re-do them and so forth, you know, they're having to change

3326
02:50:59,960 --> 02:51:07,360
it up a little bit, but if the game sold phenomenally, they would really have no choice but to continue

3327
02:51:07,360 --> 02:51:08,840
the series, you know what I mean?

3328
02:51:08,840 --> 02:51:14,000
Like the Metal Gear selection will sell well no matter what, but, you know, Silent Hill

3329
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:17,560
1 will probably sell alright, although it's really weird that 1 is not involved, but I

3330
02:51:17,560 --> 02:51:20,960
guess it has to do with all the voice acting, I don't know.

3331
02:51:20,960 --> 02:51:26,520
But yeah, you know, I think the games will sell alright, and as far as Konami's motivation,

3332
02:51:26,520 --> 02:51:31,080
I mean, it's hard to say because the whole repackaging thing, you can't like say that

3333
02:51:31,080 --> 02:51:35,140
Konami is the first to do it, so I think they're just jumping on a bandwagon that people have

3334
02:51:35,140 --> 02:51:43,920
shown they want to be on, God of War has already done it, the Ico games and Shadow of the Colossus,

3335
02:51:43,920 --> 02:51:47,620
all that stuff is being read out, you know, so the gaming populace has already shown they'll

3336
02:51:47,620 --> 02:51:51,600
buy it, so you can't really blame Konami for putting it out there.

3337
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:55,000
And even stuff that's come out recently, like the Prince of Persia trilogy, the Splinter

3338
02:51:55,000 --> 02:52:01,360
Cell trilogy is coming out a little bit later, and Tomb Raider, they already did all those

3339
02:52:01,360 --> 02:52:02,360
as well.

3340
02:52:02,360 --> 02:52:05,200
Okay, I understand that.

3341
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:10,600
Now do you think maybe time could be also a factor in this compared to like, if the

3342
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:15,520
games came out within a certain range, and maybe a couple years later they put out the

3343
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:21,100
collection compared to maybe waiting like five, six years later for a complete collection?

3344
02:52:21,100 --> 02:52:24,920
I'm not sure I follow you, these collections are coming out next year, so...

3345
02:52:24,920 --> 02:52:30,320
I mean like, let's say like, they put out Zoner Yenders 1, 2, and 3 with let's say like

3346
02:52:30,320 --> 02:52:37,680
in 2000, 2001, 2002, and like in 2005 they put out the collectors of all three together.

3347
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:42,620
Now let's say instead of 2005 they wait like till about now to put them all out, they wait

3348
02:52:42,620 --> 02:52:43,960
like almost ten years.

3349
02:52:43,960 --> 02:52:48,280
But they're gonna upres them and make them more current, you know.

3350
02:52:48,280 --> 02:52:51,480
They're redoing them in HD, so I'm okay with it.

3351
02:52:51,480 --> 02:52:54,480
Let's also be honest, how's this any different from the movie industry?

3352
02:52:54,480 --> 02:52:59,480
You know, the movie industry does this shit all the time and we eat it up, like how many

3353
02:52:59,480 --> 02:53:01,500
times did the Star Wars movies come out?

3354
02:53:01,500 --> 02:53:06,240
And they're coming out again on Blu-ray, and I know tons of people that'll be there right

3355
02:53:06,240 --> 02:53:07,240
when they come out.

3356
02:53:07,240 --> 02:53:10,160
Well, I don't mean to interrupt, Rob, that's because George Lucas turned his back on the

3357
02:53:10,160 --> 02:53:12,560
fans and he's a money-grubbing whore.

3358
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:15,920
I know that, but the new Star Wars is really awesome.

3359
02:53:15,920 --> 02:53:20,600
But what about like, okay, Harry Potter.

3360
02:53:20,600 --> 02:53:23,900
When those movies come out, they come out on Blu-ray, and then you can get a box set

3361
02:53:23,900 --> 02:53:25,480
with one through five.

3362
02:53:25,480 --> 02:53:28,520
And then when six came out, you buy six, oh and then now it's a box set with one through

3363
02:53:28,520 --> 02:53:32,120
six and maybe some other bonus features, a preview of seven.

3364
02:53:32,120 --> 02:53:33,240
Oh, now seven's out.

3365
02:53:33,240 --> 02:53:36,740
Now there's a box set of one through seven and there'll be a preview for eight.

3366
02:53:36,740 --> 02:53:40,340
And there'll be another box set when eight comes out and it'll have the special features

3367
02:53:40,340 --> 02:53:45,360
online, Uber, God, Poopy Pop, what?

3368
02:53:45,360 --> 02:53:47,280
Book seven was the last one.

3369
02:53:47,280 --> 02:53:48,280
But there was eight movies.

3370
02:53:48,280 --> 02:53:50,040
I'm talking about the movies.

3371
02:53:50,040 --> 02:53:53,040
I know, book seven was two movies, but I see your point.

3372
02:53:53,040 --> 02:53:55,160
I was just trying to be an ass.

3373
02:53:55,160 --> 02:53:56,160
You're trying to be an ass.

3374
02:53:56,160 --> 02:53:57,160
Wait, wait, wait, now hold on a second.

3375
02:53:57,160 --> 02:54:02,280
Is not, is not this new movie the eighth movie coming out?

3376
02:54:02,280 --> 02:54:07,000
I understand it's two parts, but it is, in the line of movies, the eighth movie.

3377
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Yeah.

3378
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Yeah, yes.

3379
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:10,000
It is the eighth movie.

3380
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:11,000
It is.

3381
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:14,480
Watch Warner Brothers release both movies together as movie seven.

3382
02:54:14,480 --> 02:54:17,040
Just the fuck with you.

3383
02:54:17,040 --> 02:54:18,040
It's just like Twilight.

3384
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:20,040
Aren't they splitting the last one into twos?

3385
02:54:20,040 --> 02:54:21,040
There's five movies.

3386
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:22,040
Yeah.

3387
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:24,160
As if it hasn't drug out long enough already.

3388
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:26,400
Let's put the last one in the two.

3389
02:54:26,400 --> 02:54:31,680
DJ Morin, DJ Morpheus in our chat room says, actually Lord of the Rings is the biggest

3390
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:33,320
DVD horror.

3391
02:54:33,320 --> 02:54:34,360
That's yeah.

3392
02:54:34,360 --> 02:54:37,540
Now Blu-ray horror because the super extended editions, yes.

3393
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:42,120
As if that movie wasn't long enough and theatrical re-release bullshit, which I don't give a

3394
02:54:42,120 --> 02:54:45,480
shit about and I won't go see, I wouldn't mind going to see it.

3395
02:54:45,480 --> 02:54:49,040
I know, you know, it's, I don't know if I should admit this.

3396
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:51,600
I never saw the third movie.

3397
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:54,800
I saw, I saw the first two opening day nonetheless.

3398
02:54:54,800 --> 02:54:55,800
I never saw it.

3399
02:54:55,800 --> 02:54:56,800
For me.

3400
02:54:56,800 --> 02:55:03,160
And people are going to go, oh, you're a hater, but the whole point is that I read the books.

3401
02:55:03,160 --> 02:55:06,280
The movies were good.

3402
02:55:06,280 --> 02:55:10,160
I'm more interested in the Hobbit coming out because I like the Hobbit better than I liked

3403
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:11,160
the other books.

3404
02:55:11,160 --> 02:55:12,280
I can't believe you read those books.

3405
02:55:12,280 --> 02:55:13,320
I've tried to read those books.

3406
02:55:13,320 --> 02:55:16,440
I can't like, I'm like, speak a language I can read.

3407
02:55:16,440 --> 02:55:18,440
Tolkien was so fucking boring.

3408
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:24,400
It's a good story, but my God, we don't need that much description of the grass.

3409
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:26,440
Rama, I got to let you go and get more calls.

3410
02:55:26,440 --> 02:55:30,920
Rob, before I go, I just want to say in response to Twilight, I love that picture you posted

3411
02:55:30,920 --> 02:55:32,800
on your Tumblr.

3412
02:55:32,800 --> 02:55:38,840
The one of the stakes on the fence that says in case of sparkly vampires or break off in

3413
02:55:38,840 --> 02:55:39,840
case of sparkly vampires.

3414
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:40,840
Right.

3415
02:55:40,840 --> 02:55:43,680
And I think I posted it and I put, how about screaming fangirls too?

3416
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:44,680
Yes.

3417
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:47,760
And before I go, I'm going to say, I dedicate this picture to you that I put on my blog

3418
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:48,760
post.

3419
02:55:48,760 --> 02:55:50,200
I just posted it in the chat.

3420
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:51,200
All right.

3421
02:55:51,200 --> 02:55:52,200
You got it.

3422
02:55:52,200 --> 02:55:53,200
All right.

3423
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:54,200
Later.

3424
02:55:54,200 --> 02:56:00,000
Sorry for the awkward silence there.

3425
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,880
I was typing an important message because there's a YouTube I want to find real quick

3426
02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:03,880
there.

3427
02:56:03,880 --> 02:56:04,880
So I'm trying to find it there.

3428
02:56:04,880 --> 02:56:06,600
Let me look at what Rama posted to his Tumblr.

3429
02:56:06,600 --> 02:56:07,600
Hold on one sec.

3430
02:56:07,600 --> 02:56:08,600
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

3431
02:56:08,600 --> 02:56:13,960
And I'm following the link and let's see.

3432
02:56:13,960 --> 02:56:15,120
I love that.

3433
02:56:15,120 --> 02:56:17,920
It's haters going to hate, but it's Frankenfurter from the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

3434
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:20,080
You see this dark Sakura?

3435
02:56:20,080 --> 02:56:21,080
That's awesome.

3436
02:56:21,080 --> 02:56:22,080
Okay.

3437
02:56:22,080 --> 02:56:23,160
You need to put that on Tumblr so I can reblog it.

3438
02:56:23,160 --> 02:56:24,160
It's on Rama's Tumblr.

3439
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:25,160
Okay.

3440
02:56:25,160 --> 02:56:26,160
Then I'll reblog it.

3441
02:56:26,160 --> 02:56:27,160
If you follow him.

3442
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:28,160
What's up with...

3443
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:29,160
Now it's Tumblr.

3444
02:56:29,160 --> 02:56:32,920
There was LiveJournal, which I'm a permanent member of, so I always have to love LiveJournal

3445
02:56:32,920 --> 02:56:34,360
forever and ever.

3446
02:56:34,360 --> 02:56:36,080
There's Facebook.

3447
02:56:36,080 --> 02:56:38,440
There's Myspace back in the day.

3448
02:56:38,440 --> 02:56:39,440
Friendster shit.

3449
02:56:39,440 --> 02:56:40,440
Twitter.

3450
02:56:40,440 --> 02:56:41,440
And now it's fucking Tumblr.

3451
02:56:41,440 --> 02:56:42,440
I never used Friendster.

3452
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:43,440
I never used it.

3453
02:56:43,440 --> 02:56:44,440
Really?

3454
02:56:44,440 --> 02:56:46,080
How did you avoid that?

3455
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:47,080
It was...

3456
02:56:47,080 --> 02:56:50,040
I love my LiveJournal so much.

3457
02:56:50,040 --> 02:56:51,040
That was me.

3458
02:56:51,040 --> 02:56:52,040
All right.

3459
02:56:52,040 --> 02:56:53,040
Take one more call real quick and then we're going to wrap up the show.

3460
02:56:53,040 --> 02:56:54,040
Let's go to our own Orange Pots Radio.

3461
02:56:54,040 --> 02:56:55,040
Hey, it's Blender.

3462
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:56,040
Blender!

3463
02:56:56,040 --> 02:56:57,520
What's on your mind, buddy?

3464
02:56:57,520 --> 02:56:58,880
Nothing.

3465
02:56:58,880 --> 02:57:03,960
You know, I kind of wanted to go back to this whole class action lawsuit that you guys were

3466
02:57:03,960 --> 02:57:07,100
talking about with these online games.

3467
02:57:07,100 --> 02:57:09,000
These Star Wars Galaxies?

3468
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Yeah.

3469
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:11,000
Yeah.

3470
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:12,000
What's up?

3471
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:17,480
I think eventually somebody's going to find a loophole and actually get in on this.

3472
02:57:17,480 --> 02:57:18,880
I know you guys...

3473
02:57:18,880 --> 02:57:21,640
A couple of you guys are into Disney and all that.

3474
02:57:21,640 --> 02:57:25,160
Do you remember the Virtual Magic Kingdom game?

3475
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:26,760
I don't know if you ever heard of it.

3476
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:29,800
I remember the NES game Adventures in the Magic,

3477
02:57:29,800 --> 02:57:31,400
oh wait, no, no, no, online.

3478
02:57:31,400 --> 02:57:33,520
No, no, it was the online MMO.

3479
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:34,360
I don't think I ever played it.

3480
02:57:34,360 --> 02:57:37,420
That they put out for the 50 year anniversary.

3481
02:57:37,420 --> 02:57:38,920
You know what, I know I'm familiar

3482
02:57:38,920 --> 02:57:40,240
with some of the Disney MMOs.

3483
02:57:40,240 --> 02:57:42,800
I know Club Penguin and I know that they're infamous

3484
02:57:42,800 --> 02:57:44,040
for not letting you type.

3485
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:47,840
You can only select from select phrases.

3486
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:50,160
Well, no, no, no, well what they did is

3487
02:57:50,160 --> 02:57:54,440
for the 50 year anniversary, they created an MMO,

3488
02:57:54,440 --> 02:57:57,640
which was, it was a free walk through Disneyland Park

3489
02:57:57,640 --> 02:58:00,400
and you can create friends and meet people.

3490
02:58:00,400 --> 02:58:02,040
And it really messed up some people

3491
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:03,360
when they closed that site down.

3492
02:58:03,360 --> 02:58:05,800
In fact, I got a link.

3493
02:58:05,800 --> 02:58:07,760
I don't know if it's gonna post, but.

3494
02:58:07,760 --> 02:58:10,080
Rob, Peter was telling us about that

3495
02:58:10,080 --> 02:58:10,960
when we were at the park.

3496
02:58:10,960 --> 02:58:11,920
I don't know, I just.

3497
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:14,720
Because I have a pen from it.

3498
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:16,960
Oh, that's right, that I do remember.

3499
02:58:16,960 --> 02:58:17,800
Yeah. Yes, I do.

3500
02:58:17,800 --> 02:58:20,800
Yeah, I have one of the links that I just picked.

3501
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:22,440
It was from joystick.com

3502
02:58:22,440 --> 02:58:24,480
is when they closed the actual site.

3503
02:58:24,480 --> 02:58:27,680
And you know, it was really devastating

3504
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:30,440
because I was actually on it for like two years.

3505
02:58:30,440 --> 02:58:35,440
And it just, it killed a lot of kids.

3506
02:58:36,320 --> 02:58:39,280
There was like 10, 11 year old kids that could,

3507
02:58:39,280 --> 02:58:42,680
or even younger that couldn't play this game anymore.

3508
02:58:42,680 --> 02:58:46,080
And I really think that somebody's gonna find a loophole

3509
02:58:46,080 --> 02:58:48,960
with closing down these large MMOs

3510
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:51,360
that they're gonna, you know,

3511
02:58:51,360 --> 02:58:53,960
find a psychological way to get out of this.

3512
02:58:53,960 --> 02:58:56,120
They can always, it's weird though

3513
02:58:56,120 --> 02:58:59,000
that a company should be like locked into doing it.

3514
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:00,800
You know, like, I'm not sure I agree with that,

3515
02:59:00,800 --> 02:59:03,400
but I think the nice thing, quote unquote, to do,

3516
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:06,160
if you're gonna pull support for your game altogether

3517
02:59:06,160 --> 02:59:08,360
is to go the Phantasy Star route.

3518
02:59:08,360 --> 02:59:10,080
And when they closed up Blue Burst,

3519
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:13,720
they just said, here, open up your own damn servers.

3520
02:59:13,720 --> 02:59:15,120
And if you wanna copy your characters over,

3521
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:16,240
here's how you do it.

3522
02:59:16,240 --> 02:59:17,360
Like, isn't that right?

3523
02:59:17,360 --> 02:59:18,800
Dark Soccer, you followed this better than I did,

3524
02:59:18,800 --> 02:59:20,520
but Blue Burst, when they went under,

3525
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:21,760
Sega was very much like-

3526
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:24,760
Sega was like, here's your character data

3527
02:59:24,760 --> 02:59:27,280
and you can transfer it to the server of your choice.

3528
02:59:27,280 --> 02:59:29,880
Yeah, but you're in an interesting position

3529
02:59:29,880 --> 02:59:34,480
with Star Wars Galaxies because they probably just don't,

3530
02:59:34,480 --> 02:59:37,320
they want those people playing the BioWare Star Wars game

3531
02:59:37,320 --> 02:59:38,240
that's coming out.

3532
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:40,960
They don't want them on the old game.

3533
02:59:40,960 --> 02:59:44,120
They don't wanna split the fan base like EverQuest did.

3534
02:59:44,120 --> 02:59:46,760
A lot of people look at what EverQuest did

3535
02:59:46,760 --> 02:59:49,880
and say, oh boy, that was a mistake.

3536
02:59:49,880 --> 02:59:51,720
They should have never put out EverQuest 2

3537
02:59:51,720 --> 02:59:54,320
because people were still tied to EverQuest 1

3538
02:59:54,320 --> 02:59:55,160
and didn't wanna play it

3539
02:59:55,160 --> 02:59:56,560
and then it split their fan base.

3540
02:59:56,560 --> 02:59:59,480
That's why there will never be a World of Warcraft 2.

3541
02:59:59,480 --> 03:00:02,920
There will never be a World of Warcraft 2.

3542
03:00:02,920 --> 03:00:05,440
The closest thing you get are these expansions

3543
03:00:05,440 --> 03:00:10,080
such as Cataclysm that changed Warcraft so drastically,

3544
03:00:10,080 --> 03:00:11,560
it's almost like a sequel.

3545
03:00:11,560 --> 03:00:16,560
So the way you're talking about it is breaking it up

3546
03:00:16,880 --> 03:00:21,480
instead of like, for example, Virtual Magic Kingdom

3547
03:00:21,480 --> 03:00:24,480
where they closed it down totally.

3548
03:00:24,480 --> 03:00:25,840
They should have gone open source

3549
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:28,280
so somebody who loved it could have kept it going

3550
03:00:28,280 --> 03:00:30,920
but how can you force a company to do that?

3551
03:00:32,080 --> 03:00:32,920
Yeah.

3552
03:00:32,920 --> 03:00:33,760
You can't.

3553
03:00:33,760 --> 03:00:36,600
And it's so funny because we were,

3554
03:00:36,600 --> 03:00:38,120
I had a bunch of friends on there

3555
03:00:38,120 --> 03:00:41,680
and we were on there for, oh, we'd go on there every day.

3556
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:46,680
And the thing was, the kids that were on this actual site

3557
03:00:47,840 --> 03:00:50,520
weren't allowed to actually give out emails

3558
03:00:50,520 --> 03:00:52,360
and communicate with each other.

3559
03:00:52,360 --> 03:00:55,880
They were only allowed to talk on this Virtual Magic Kingdom

3560
03:00:56,840 --> 03:01:00,280
You weren't allowed to give any personal information away.

3561
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:01,600
Right, right, because you were very restricted

3562
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:02,440
to what you could say.

3563
03:01:02,440 --> 03:01:04,320
All of a sudden they said in a month from now,

3564
03:01:04,320 --> 03:01:08,240
we're closing the site and it's done, that's it.

3565
03:01:08,240 --> 03:01:10,000
And you should just,

3566
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:13,600
God, it just killed a bunch of these little kids, you know.

3567
03:01:13,600 --> 03:01:16,440
It's sad, but at the same time,

3568
03:01:16,440 --> 03:01:18,160
how can you force a company to keep something going

3569
03:01:18,160 --> 03:01:19,360
that's not making them any money?

3570
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:20,640
Hey. Right, right.

3571
03:01:20,640 --> 03:01:21,480
There's a-

3572
03:01:21,480 --> 03:01:23,160
If the miniature golf place closes down,

3573
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:24,480
what can you do about it?

3574
03:01:24,480 --> 03:01:25,320
Yeah.

3575
03:01:25,320 --> 03:01:28,800
Someone's actually made a quote replacement

3576
03:01:28,800 --> 03:01:31,720
called Virtual Family Kingdom.

3577
03:01:31,720 --> 03:01:33,280
Oh no, no, yeah, I've seen that one.

3578
03:01:33,280 --> 03:01:36,480
It was actually a lot, everybody jumped over to that.

3579
03:01:36,480 --> 03:01:39,920
That was sponsored by the Smithsonian Kingdom

3580
03:01:39,920 --> 03:01:42,720
or Smithsonian Institute.

3581
03:01:42,720 --> 03:01:43,560
Interesting.

3582
03:01:43,560 --> 03:01:45,560
But it was just, it was horrible.

3583
03:01:45,560 --> 03:01:47,480
I mean, we went over to that.

3584
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:52,480
But I don't know if you guys saw the post that I put,

3585
03:01:52,600 --> 03:01:54,800
like you should see some of the stories that were,

3586
03:01:54,800 --> 03:01:58,760
there was actually people protesting in front of Disneyland

3587
03:01:58,760 --> 03:02:00,080
the day that it closed down.

3588
03:02:00,080 --> 03:02:00,920
Wow.

3589
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:01,760
Because they were so upset.

3590
03:02:01,760 --> 03:02:02,880
Wow.

3591
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:03,720
Yeah.

3592
03:02:03,720 --> 03:02:06,160
Well, maybe they'll be protesting on Starbucks.

3593
03:02:06,160 --> 03:02:10,000
The only thing that ties in with the class action lawsuit

3594
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:11,520
that you guys were talking about

3595
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:13,280
is I think that somebody's gonna find

3596
03:02:13,280 --> 03:02:16,200
a psychological loophole that's gonna say,

3597
03:02:16,200 --> 03:02:19,600
you close down this site that I've spent so much time into,

3598
03:02:21,480 --> 03:02:23,120
I'm gonna be able to get some money out of it.

3599
03:02:23,120 --> 03:02:23,960
I don't know.

3600
03:02:23,960 --> 03:02:25,640
I still think the terms of service

3601
03:02:25,640 --> 03:02:28,960
are gonna ultimately let the companies come out ahead.

3602
03:02:28,960 --> 03:02:29,800
But we'll see.

3603
03:02:29,800 --> 03:02:30,640
All right, we'll see.

3604
03:02:30,640 --> 03:02:31,480
I gotta let you go, buddy, so you wrap up the show.

3605
03:02:31,480 --> 03:02:32,320
All right, thank you, thank you.

3606
03:02:32,320 --> 03:02:33,200
Thank you for your call.

3607
03:02:33,200 --> 03:02:34,480
Appreciate it.

3608
03:02:34,480 --> 03:02:35,320
It was a good topic.

3609
03:02:35,320 --> 03:02:36,440
I like that.

3610
03:02:36,440 --> 03:02:38,040
Blender, live on OLR.

3611
03:02:38,040 --> 03:02:39,120
We're gonna show off the Skype line.

3612
03:02:39,120 --> 03:02:40,200
Sorry to you guys who didn't get through

3613
03:02:40,200 --> 03:02:41,240
on the Skype line tonight.

3614
03:02:41,240 --> 03:02:43,000
But if you wanna send us an email with your thoughts,

3615
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:44,560
mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com,

3616
03:02:44,560 --> 03:02:47,160
or of course you can always tweet us, twitter.com slash OLR.

3617
03:02:47,160 --> 03:02:48,400
By the way, I found this,

3618
03:02:48,400 --> 03:02:51,760
you know, DJ Rama was talking about Twilight

3619
03:02:51,760 --> 03:02:53,600
and how much he doesn't really like Twilight,

3620
03:02:53,600 --> 03:02:55,040
but yet, I don't know you guys.

3621
03:02:55,040 --> 03:02:56,320
I got sent this YouTube,

3622
03:02:56,320 --> 03:02:58,920
and this is a YouTube of DJ Rama S

3623
03:02:58,920 --> 03:03:02,200
actually watching the Breaking Dawn trailer.

3624
03:03:02,200 --> 03:03:03,480
And let's see.

3625
03:03:03,480 --> 03:03:05,480
Let's see how Rama actually reacted

3626
03:03:05,480 --> 03:03:07,000
to seeing this trailer the first time.

3627
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:08,560
Cool.

3628
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:10,160
Fucking massive boobs.

3629
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:12,280
Shh.

3630
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:15,640
Ah.

3631
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:17,760
Ah.

3632
03:03:20,680 --> 03:03:23,400
Oh my God, I'm still living in mine.

3633
03:03:23,400 --> 03:03:24,240
No.

3634
03:03:26,400 --> 03:03:28,240
God, Rama, you're getting really upset over this.

3635
03:03:28,240 --> 03:03:29,160
I'm so sad.

3636
03:03:29,160 --> 03:03:30,000
No.

3637
03:03:31,880 --> 03:03:32,720
No.

3638
03:03:33,720 --> 03:03:35,040
Don't get naked.

3639
03:03:36,040 --> 03:03:37,240
Don't get naked, Rama.

3640
03:03:37,240 --> 03:03:38,920
You were the one talking about vagina

3641
03:03:38,920 --> 03:03:40,760
in the chat room earlier.

3642
03:03:40,760 --> 03:03:41,600
No.

3643
03:03:44,400 --> 03:03:45,840
Stop it.

3644
03:03:45,840 --> 03:03:47,080
All right, let me tell you what this really is.

3645
03:03:47,080 --> 03:03:49,080
This is some chick.

3646
03:03:49,080 --> 03:03:50,680
So let me just pop, show me this video.

3647
03:03:50,680 --> 03:03:52,320
It goes on for seven and a half minutes.

3648
03:03:52,320 --> 03:03:55,320
It's a trailer reaction video to this chick.

3649
03:03:55,320 --> 03:03:57,680
And I guess what she did, what is this?

3650
03:03:57,680 --> 03:04:00,240
She was internet famous for starting

3651
03:04:00,240 --> 03:04:03,400
the Fuck Stephen King movement when, I guess,

3652
03:04:03,400 --> 03:04:04,960
Stephen King knocked the Twilight series

3653
03:04:04,960 --> 03:04:06,160
and said it was badly written.

3654
03:04:06,160 --> 03:04:07,440
And that's a video of her watching

3655
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:09,480
the Breaking Dawn trailer for the first time.

3656
03:04:09,480 --> 03:04:11,800
Well, it was badly written.

3657
03:04:13,640 --> 03:04:15,240
I tried to read a page of that.

3658
03:04:15,240 --> 03:04:18,000
And I was like, who let this woman write?

3659
03:04:19,880 --> 03:04:23,360
There should be a class action lawsuit against Bic

3660
03:04:23,360 --> 03:04:25,040
for selling that woman a pen.

3661
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:25,880
All right.

3662
03:04:28,280 --> 03:04:30,920
She's, I blame her for being Mormon.

3663
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:35,800
I love DJ Morpheus in chat.

3664
03:04:35,800 --> 03:04:37,240
That's just cold, Rob.

3665
03:04:37,240 --> 03:04:39,920
That's coming from Travis of all people.

3666
03:04:41,560 --> 03:04:43,640
Dude, that's just cold.

3667
03:04:43,640 --> 03:04:46,000
All right, that's gonna do it for another week

3668
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:46,840
Orange on Trail.

3669
03:04:46,840 --> 03:04:48,240
Or do we have any other last minute news?

3670
03:04:48,240 --> 03:04:49,080
Did I miss anything?

3671
03:04:49,080 --> 03:04:50,240
I think we got it.

3672
03:04:50,240 --> 03:04:51,240
Just real quick stuff.

3673
03:04:51,240 --> 03:04:53,160
I'm alive.

3674
03:04:53,160 --> 03:04:54,600
Supposed to be coming out still.

3675
03:04:54,600 --> 03:04:56,920
But because the classifications are found

3676
03:04:56,920 --> 03:04:57,760
on the Australian website

3677
03:04:57,760 --> 03:04:59,200
and Crisis is supposed to be coming

3678
03:04:59,200 --> 03:05:01,080
to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

3679
03:05:02,320 --> 03:05:03,440
Cause it is on the SRB.

3680
03:05:04,400 --> 03:05:05,240
All right.

3681
03:05:05,240 --> 03:05:07,560
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

3682
03:05:07,560 --> 03:05:08,560
Before we get the final thoughts,

3683
03:05:08,560 --> 03:05:09,440
I wanna thank you once again

3684
03:05:09,440 --> 03:05:10,520
for listening to Orange on Trail

3685
03:05:10,520 --> 03:05:13,360
and supporting us over these nine years of our program.

3686
03:05:13,360 --> 03:05:15,200
Of course, we're here to do it every Sunday night.

3687
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:17,280
So if you've never just come out for a live show,

3688
03:05:17,280 --> 03:05:18,120
it's a bummer.

3689
03:05:18,120 --> 03:05:18,960
Tonight would have been a great night

3690
03:05:18,960 --> 03:05:20,960
cause many folks out there don't work on Monday.

3691
03:05:20,960 --> 03:05:23,560
But you know, if you have the time in the future,

3692
03:05:23,560 --> 03:05:25,240
please do consider joining us for a live show.

3693
03:05:25,240 --> 03:05:26,680
We do tape live at All Games Radio,

3694
03:05:26,680 --> 03:05:27,840
allgames.com.

3695
03:05:27,840 --> 03:05:30,040
Sunday nights at six Pacific, nine Eastern,

3696
03:05:30,040 --> 03:05:30,880
right after the Bobby Blackwood show.

3697
03:05:30,880 --> 03:05:32,160
You always say specific.

3698
03:05:32,160 --> 03:05:33,680
Specific, six Pacific.

3699
03:05:33,680 --> 03:05:35,920
It's cause they all kind of run together.

3700
03:05:35,920 --> 03:05:38,000
I talk too fast for radio.

3701
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:38,840
You know what?

3702
03:05:38,840 --> 03:05:39,680
That's why I'm stuck here.

3703
03:05:39,680 --> 03:05:40,500
You know what?

3704
03:05:40,500 --> 03:05:41,340
What?

3705
03:05:41,340 --> 03:05:42,960
It also goes along with like one of my pet peeves

3706
03:05:42,960 --> 03:05:43,800
and songs.

3707
03:05:43,800 --> 03:05:46,280
So people instead of saying, don't you say, don't you?

3708
03:05:46,280 --> 03:05:49,520
Oh, don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?

3709
03:05:49,520 --> 03:05:52,720
I was like, you, not chew.

3710
03:05:52,720 --> 03:05:55,240
Chew is a sound that mice make in Japan.

3711
03:05:55,240 --> 03:05:58,280
Chew is a sound that what's-her-name makes

3712
03:05:58,280 --> 03:05:59,520
in Space Channel Five.

3713
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:00,360
La la.

3714
03:06:00,360 --> 03:06:01,440
Because it's chew.

3715
03:06:01,440 --> 03:06:02,280
Ooh la la.

3716
03:06:02,280 --> 03:06:03,100
Ooh la la.

3717
03:06:03,100 --> 03:06:04,880
You know, actually Space Channel Five part two

3718
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:06,960
is on Steam for six bucks.

3719
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:07,780
Oh, nice.

3720
03:06:07,780 --> 03:06:08,620
Yeah.

3721
03:06:08,620 --> 03:06:10,040
I already have like two copies of it.

3722
03:06:10,040 --> 03:06:10,920
Very nice.

3723
03:06:10,920 --> 03:06:12,000
Lots of good stuff to buy on Steam.

3724
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:13,120
I tell you, BitTrip Runner,

3725
03:06:13,120 --> 03:06:16,080
if it's still $2 and 50 cents is a great buy.

3726
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:17,920
Anyhow, that's gonna do it for another episode

3727
03:06:17,920 --> 03:06:18,760
of Orange House Radio.

3728
03:06:18,760 --> 03:06:19,580
Please help spread the word.

3729
03:06:19,580 --> 03:06:20,760
Da da da da da.

3730
03:06:20,760 --> 03:06:22,800
OrangeHouseRadio.com, join our website,

3731
03:06:22,800 --> 03:06:24,280
check the forums, all that good stuff.

3732
03:06:24,280 --> 03:06:25,940
We really need to get the activity on the forums again.

3733
03:06:25,940 --> 03:06:28,820
I gotta really think about how we can get those going.

3734
03:06:28,820 --> 03:06:30,440
But meanwhile, let's go around

3735
03:06:30,440 --> 03:06:32,040
and get everybody's final thought for tonight.

3736
03:06:32,040 --> 03:06:32,920
So, Loki, we'll start with you.

3737
03:06:32,920 --> 03:06:34,520
What's your final thought tonight?

3738
03:06:34,520 --> 03:06:35,840
I need to work in some more

3739
03:06:35,840 --> 03:06:39,160
Earth Defense Force this weekend.

3740
03:06:39,160 --> 03:06:41,680
Got to play it for a few hours last night.

3741
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:43,320
Really need to play more of that.

3742
03:06:44,600 --> 03:06:46,440
My final thought of the night is, you know what?

3743
03:06:46,440 --> 03:06:48,720
Vanilla and Hope, they aren't that bad.

3744
03:06:48,720 --> 03:06:52,220
Like 30 hours later, they aren't that bad.

3745
03:06:52,220 --> 03:06:54,520
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

3746
03:06:54,520 --> 03:06:55,620
Lesbians.

3747
03:06:57,360 --> 03:06:58,200
Fuck yeah.

3748
03:06:59,360 --> 03:07:01,080
I just looked at Alan's Twitter.

3749
03:07:01,080 --> 03:07:02,800
I mean, Tumblr.

3750
03:07:02,800 --> 03:07:04,760
Wait, what's Alan tweeting about lesbians for?

3751
03:07:04,760 --> 03:07:05,640
This is his picture.

3752
03:07:05,640 --> 03:07:07,440
Oh, and don't buy, my other final thought,

3753
03:07:07,440 --> 03:07:09,760
don't buy your games from eBay.

3754
03:07:09,760 --> 03:07:11,800
Unless they're, well, I guess the used market's okay,

3755
03:07:11,800 --> 03:07:12,840
but just be careful.

3756
03:07:12,840 --> 03:07:14,680
Be a buyer beware on eBay.

3757
03:07:14,680 --> 03:07:15,520
All right, that's-

3758
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:17,340
Just look at the feedback before you buy.

3759
03:07:17,340 --> 03:07:18,760
That's it, guys, have a wonderful night.

3760
