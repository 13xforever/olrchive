13888	22990	Tonight, July 24th, 2011, games appear to be incoming to Google+, Sony experiments with virtual reality, and you know we've got to talk about Capcom.
31297	38279	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38699	47461	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about video games and gaming culture and all of that with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47741	48101	Ooga.
48341	48882	How are you doing?
49122	49422	Booga.
50939	52060	Dark Sakura, you've been very, very naughty.
52080	52721	Thank you, sir.
52741	53662	May I have another?
76381	76541	No.
77002	79624	Alright, say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster, Loki.
80445	81345	How are you doing, Loki?
81986	82807	You're actually muted.
82847	83187	There you go.
83227	84188	How are you doing now, Loki?
84268	84989	I'm doing better.
85249	87030	We're having mic fail tonight in studio.
87611	90113	If I sound different, by the way, don't adjust your speakers.
90433	91014	It's on our end.
91054	92295	I'm on backup mic tonight.
92575	93376	He's on helium.
94357	95858	Yes, maybe a little bit.
96178	101803	No, I think I'm just on the overly sensitive mic, which for my voice is really not good, but that's all we got tonight.
102023	102624	Rob's high on life.
102644	103504	Let's switch mics.
105727	110531	No, because I know you're going to have a rant or two in you tonight, and I'm not letting you do that on this mic.
110571	113394	You will blow up speakers across America and beyond.
115035	116256	Well, what's new in your world, Loki?
118558	118858	Nothing.
119279	121400	So Josh is turning one very soon, right?
121580	122381	Yeah, a week from Monday.
122521	123802	Your baby is turning one.
124062	128185	And the other week you were talking about your possible party plans you were doing.
128466	132649	And I was talking to the wife today, and it sounds like you guys have settled on a theme, correct?
132689	133830	Well, yeah.
134470	135971	It was always going to be like the pork party.
136231	139754	Oh, I thought at one point you were talking about the pedo bear party.
140274	142596	No, those were just funny ideas we were throwing around.
142616	143657	I see, I see.
143917	145197	So you are going to do the pork party.
145458	146078	Yes.
146158	148719	Teach the child at a young age about the wonders of bacon, right?
149039	149399	Of course.
149839	150179	All right.
151099	151919	Well, have fun with that.
151960	152720	That'll be a lot of fun.
153160	153380	All right.
153400	164043	We're going to have fun with you guys here live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, as we do every week, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
164403	172746	If you want to join us in chat, we are ready to go in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and we do read comments from chat throughout the show.
173586	177667	For instance, some folks commenting on Bunga Bunga, the game we were talking about a minute ago.
178047	180628	Actdeft says that game didn't make it outside of Japan.
181208	182349	I wonder why, y'all.
183949	185349	But no, seriously, like Google it.
185530	188410	It was a real game, so it's something else.
188430	191291	If I had the money and it was cheap enough, I'd... You would import it?
191311	191971	I'd import it.
192011	193652	It's just really expensive to import.
193672	195012	Give that to Josh for his birthday?
195032	196773	It'd just be fun to have.
196873	198393	Just put it in my garage.
199193	200014	What the hell is that?
200034	201154	Hey guys, want to come over?
202520	203761	DarkSakura, what you been doing?
224549	225429	I played WoW.
225690	227151	I finally hit my next item level.
227471	228452	Congrats.
228572	228973	Addict.
229493	229794	Dealer.
231615	233617	And I played some other games.
233958	237461	I played Kid Dracula again because I love that game.
237761	239103	Going back, kicking it Game Boy.
239283	241125	Kid Dracula is an old ass game.
241565	248130	Yeah, and we actually watched a playthrough of the NES version, so I was playing the Game Boy version.
248590	254615	And I have been fighting and fighting with Planet Harriers to get it to work on MAME to no avail.
254635	256637	Because it's not done yet.
257077	261941	I know, but there's a Hikaru BIOS and all this other stuff I was playing with and it's not working.
263202	264923	So, well...
265920	269323	Classic Gaming in Your Week Classic Gaming in Your Week
287421	288841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
317250	319330	So we've been all about the homebrew.
320822	323283	I saw an interesting little cabinet the other day.
323364	327026	I was at this pizza joint in town that had... It wasn't an Altercade.
327166	328346	I'll tell you that right off the bat.
328366	328967	It wasn't an Altercade.
328987	332049	It was some other type of machine that had a lot of classic games in it.
332089	337172	But the interesting thing about it is it was Pac-Man and Donkey Kong and Galaga.
337432	345917	And it was kind of like... You don't usually see Nintendo games participating in the collections because Nintendo keeps that stuff to Nintendo.
346177	346957	So it was kind of weird.
346977	347598	Like, where did this...
347978	348939	Like the PlayChoice?
349319	350901	Yeah, where did... No, it wasn't PlayChoice, though.
350921	355765	It was like actual arcade Pac-Man and Galaga and stuff, so... And that was talking about the Nintendo ones.
355945	356786	Oh, yeah, I remember those.
356806	358007	The Nintendo's were the PlayChoice games.
358027	359568	Yeah, or like the Wii and stuff now.
359608	363732	You don't see a lot of like the retro... It had to have been a homebrew type of self-made thing.
363752	364372	I don't know.
364412	371198	It was interesting, though, because, you know, I remember Salacious Pop commenting on it like, those are games you wouldn't usually see together in a collection.
371438	373380	Yeah, but I don't think it's a homebrew thing.
373540	374000	They have...
374961	382026	Other machines, they're very similar to the multi-game machines.
382486	384488	They have packs that you can buy.
384968	390812	So it's like, okay, here's Atari games, here's Nintendo, here's Capcom or whatever.
391333	392654	So they've got those out there.
394955	397737	It's just I didn't know Nintendo to usually participate in those.
397858	401200	Usually it's kind of like they keep it for their own systems and so forth.
404251	406892	whatever's alright well let's move on Loki how was your gaming week?
408553	422858	same old stuff didn't really play a whole ton of stuff other than basically Grand Theft Auto and I think I did play a little bit of Earth Defense Force in there this week mainly Grand Theft Auto just you know
425236	425956	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
445828	446730	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
458343	459664	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
477061	503046	Um, no, it was funny, we, uh, we have these nice Sony headsets, like, headphones, I should say, not headsets, um, headphones that we use for the gameplay, we have it hooked up through the stereo connectors on all the VGA cables, but, you know, as you know, you can't really talk over a headset because the headset goes on your head, and it's usually meant for people to have TV's,
503226	503967	Thanks for watching!
522703	523503	And so that's what I did.
523563	525604	I snapped the headpiece off.
526204	528105	I broke the thing apart.
528265	531467	I took out the actual speaker from the headphone.
531787	537689	And then, of course, the only way I could attach it to it is with plain old tape.
538489	539990	Just scotch tape.
540350	541190	Not even duct tape.
541390	542231	Not even duct tape.
542271	543231	Just scotch tape.
543471	546872	Here's the reason why I did scotch tape, because these are nice headphones.
547052	548173	I don't want to ruin them.
548673	549633	I just want it to stay.
550153	554675	And it works great, because now we have the nice headphones, and we can talk.
556174	562878	for the occasional person that's from Mexico or... Usually it's the UK.
562918	574605	We've got people that complain in the UK and every now and then it's like, gee, I really wish I had a headset so I could tell them to shut the hell up because they'll be like, oh, you have to use the stickies to kill me.
574685	575005	What?
575366	575906	You suck?
575926	577947	You just can't kill me with anything else?
578087	581209	So then I proceed to kill them with every weapon in the game and they still complain.
581249	581289	So...
583270	584511	So you've gotten in lately.
585192	589955	Long story short, you fixed headphones so that you could smack talk people on Xbox Live this week.
590315	591896	And what types of things do you tell them off with?
592677	594318	Do you want some tea and crumpets with your wine?
594378	596059	I haven't really been using it to talk.
596699	598861	I originally gave it to my co-worker, Jason.
598881	605425	Unfortunately, we had to take it away from him because all he kept doing throughout the first game is going, Hello?
606306	607346	Hello?
608107	609368	And we're like, listen, okay?
609488	612330	You're not going to talk like a rapist over the goddamn...
613050	613971	You know, headset.
613991	615712	We're taking that damn thing away from you.
615972	624078	No, I gave it to my other coworker, Rob, now, and he'll usually do a Julia Child impersonation on there, which is pretty fun.
624118	626540	First, we're going to get the cake and kill you with it.
626580	628141	It's all, hello, boobies!
629502	631763	Wait, that sounds like Dame Edna, actually.
631783	633924	Hello, my puppets!
634744	636705	Welcome to your death!
636985	646368	I didn't say that his impersonations were good, but he'll do the French knight from... Shall I kill you with my sticky whip?
647408	648910	But there's some pretty funny ones.
649030	653313	I love playing with the people in the UK because I love their accent.
653353	658958	And the kids that we play with on there, I'm going to get the orange, fella.
658978	662041	Really proper English is hilarious to me.
663522	669405	By the way, I didn't think any British impersonation could be worse than mine, but yours is really bad.
669425	671906	Well, I was doing an impersonation of what he does.
672866	675408	I can't vouch for his impersonation of anything.
676528	678229	No, it's just fun.
679430	683632	Really, this is just a temporary thing until I get my Saints Row headset.
683872	688795	Now, we do know that the Saints Row Collector's Edition headset is not compatible through Live.
689935	692478	Without some adapters that I can easily find.
693078	695160	So I will have my auto-tuned voice.
695200	698103	They're selling headsets for Saints Row that you can't use for live?
698444	699965	Yes, and it comes with a collector's edition.
700305	703208	It's only meant for PCs and phones.
703629	704089	Okay.
704209	709034	It's because it's got a 3.5mm connection, whereas most of those things are 2.5mm.
709054	710736	They were too cheap to make a deal with Microsoft.
711176	712417	Yes, they were too cheap.
712517	726567	So basically there's a thing that you can get that splits a headset into both the speaker and the microphone port and then there's something in the reverse that goes to 2.5mm.
726607	731491	So I can get that stuff and I can make it work.
731791	732692	I've already figured it out.
732712	734593	I've already bookmarked the stuff on Amazon.
734693	737255	It's all a matter of waiting now.
737635	738516	I've... I've thought of...
752792	754372	I was going to do one better on that.
754552	761274	I can do this once I get that actual device to connect my autotune headset.
762634	770076	You hook up a splitter to it and then you hook it up to your iPod or iPhone or whatever and just pull up a soundboard and tap away.
770136	770636	There you go.
770656	771456	Nice.
771696	773997	The Trash Talk is pretty awesome, but it's only four.
774337	779058	Sometimes you want Duke Nukem to say a few other things other than the four preset stuff.
779238	779618	That's right.
780612	782052	Four insults is very limiting.
782372	782853	Exactly.
782873	783953	Repeat yourself a little much.
784053	784313	All right.
784553	789134	And pushing buttons on the headset and stuff to make Duke Nukem say things.
789594	795456	It's funny, but see, the problem is because I cut the speaker off, so I can't hear what it's actually saying.
795876	798956	I can't hear myself talk over everything.
799096	803618	I can only hear my coworkers saying, oh, yeah, I heard you.
804638	805198	That's the only way.
806580	820059	whatever works good luck in your trash talking with the Brits adventure whatever comes of that let's see my gaming week actually not a whole lot of new stuff I had a very Jamie week all I really played was wow this week
821921	823541	I did play a few other things, though.
823581	824862	There was a few other things I played.
825662	827884	Like, I went back to the fitness game, and I gave that another go.
827944	833066	Remember I razzed that game on the show last week, the Yourself Fitness, because it didn't have me stretched beforehand?
833106	835687	Well, this time I stretched, and what do you know?
835868	838309	I made it a lot further in the opening act.
838329	844012	I actually made it through the entire calibration this time and didn't feel like dying the next day.
844312	848574	My legs were a little sore that night, but it wasn't nearly the pain and suffering I went through the week before.
848954	850095	Like I'm actually walking today.
850115	851256	Do you think you can bring it over?
851676	852397	If you really want to see it.
852417	853678	Why don't you come over to my place?
853698	854818	Why do I always have to come over here?
854838	857080	You should come pet the kitties.
857460	860983	I do want to go to your place, but you've never given me your address, silly Rob.
861083	863285	Well, my address is... Something.
863405	863705	Oh, wait.
863785	864546	I can't say it here.
866147	866407	All right.
866969	869551	1, 2, 3, any street, Anytown, USA
890066	902016	It's a place where they take kids in elementary school, and it's one of those tiny towns where all the buildings are built at a kid's height or whatever, so that when they're walking through the town, they're little Godzillas in the town.
902056	908702	But it's where they learn about safety and look both ways before you cross the street, or the little plastic cars will get you, things like that.
909482	912705	But it's adorable to drive by and look at because all these tiny, chibi little buildings.
913065	917189	So I don't know why, but Loki talking about any town in the USA, maybe think of Safetyville, USA.
917429	919289	It's like that town in Hot Fuzz.
920630	921030	I guess.
921070	922970	I haven't seen Hot Fuzz, so I guess.
922990	924891	There's like a miniature of the main village.
925211	925491	Is there?
925671	925991	Yeah.
926591	927831	I don't see like any movies.
927911	929212	I was just talking about this the other day.
930232	931532	I didn't see Captain America.
932112	933193	I didn't see Green Lantern.
933813	934453	I didn't see Green Hornet.
934473	936053	That's because Green Lantern was shit anyway.
936954	939534	Well, but you are clearly a Marvel fan girl.
940354	943215	DC fans have said that Green Lantern was shit.
943235	944175	I heard it was terrible.
944295	944915	I don't know.
945356	946336	Look, look.
947316	952177	I know some of y'all don't want to hear it, but I would gladly pay money to look at Ryan Reynolds for two hours, okay?
952197	953417	But it's actually not him.
953497	954898	It's a CG fake body.
956098	957978	Now, when Deadpool comes out... Imagination's all the same.
958138	959179	All right, look.
959839	960939	That's not what we're here to talk about.
961239	962299	Other games I played this week.
962339	964360	I did check out the demo for one new title.
964640	974122	I don't like doing game reviews based on a demo, but I will say it was a great demo, and it did kind of sell me on the game, and that was Bastion on Xbox Live, which is a new game that's...
975343	977325	Summer of Arcade Solstice and Equinox
996482	997162	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1015451	1034547	and I used to love those games and so when I played Bastion it kind of was that same thing I was like oh this is kind of cool but it's the art style is very different the art style reminds me a little more something like I don't know Braid or something but what I thought was really neat about it is that the levels kind of appear as you're walking very interesting and then of course most of all the way the story is told is that
1035287	1036368	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1060527	1061628	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1090126	1091547	So you do have to kind of make some decisions.
1091607	1093389	And I just, I don't know, I thought that was kind of neat.
1094830	1095811	Just the whole way it was designed.
1095831	1097992	So I definitely think I will pick up the full version of that.
1098393	1103557	It does seem to be like there's, like I noticed right when I got to the end of the demo in the main world.
1105576	1112961	Well, not the main world, but like, I guess the Bastion Square or whatever the central square is that's supposed to be like the hub that I guess the rest of the game takes place through.
1113361	1118505	I noticed that there was a place where I could put a shop of one of two types.
1118685	1120346	I could pick one or the other.
1120686	1124409	So it's kind of like the choice on what you put there will affect your game a little later.
1124709	1131493	Unfortunately, the demo doesn't let you kind of fully realize that out, but I'll have to tell you more about that when I pick up the full game.
1131914	1132034	So...
1132614	1135015	DarkTetsuya is asking, can you do the rest of the show like that?
1135095	1135655	No, I can't.
1154435	1157337	Maybe I'll read an email tonight in that voice.
1157417	1158878	DarkSakura can pick an email and I'll do it.
1159718	1159998	Okay.
1160179	1160459	Alright.
1160679	1161159	I'm just kidding.
1161199	1161700	I'm not going to do it.
1163381	1163801	Let's see.
1164581	1166102	Stop trying to get out of reading emails.
1167183	1168424	I think that's really it.
1168544	1171445	Otherwise, I've just been playing a lot of the other same stuff I've been playing.
1171465	1172306	Like, Beat Hazard.
1172826	1175048	I tried to play Survival Mode one night.
1175088	1175948	I didn't get very far.
1175968	1177149	I got through like a song and a half.
1177969	1179670	And just, you know, playing some other stuff on Steam.
1179730	1182192	Bit.Trip and some of the other games I've talked about in previous weeks.
1182392	1197457	Bastion is probably the only new thing I've played I have two games at home sitting for my game rental service waiting to play and I just haven't gotten around to playing them and that's Test Drive 2 and one of the Need for Speed games I don't even remember which one
1198686	1199507	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1222610	1237183	and you know I'm not going to tell anybody else what to do and I realize that there are people that might be employees of GameStop and so forth that listen to this show and I want you to know the boycott does not have to do with any type of like store employee
1237683	1257023	but the management of GameStop is like doing things to a friend of mine right now that I really don't agree with and we're talking like things of a legal nature that just like disgust me like the way this person who worked for this company with so much loyalty for so many years really I think demonstrated and somebody who I think
1258104	1259065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1287703	1288965	that's going to do that to people.
1289486	1291409	It's gross.
1291790	1293873	And it's... I don't know.
1293933	1294895	I'm not going to support it.
1295035	1298080	I'm not going to support this company...
1300479	1302320	I don't even know how far I want to go with this.
1302360	1303421	I got to be careful what I say.
1303481	1305623	But I'm just saying, I'm boycotting GameStop.
1306644	1310567	I would encourage you, but I'm not going to tell you what to do.
1310787	1313770	And I realize we may have employees that listen to the show.
1314190	1317052	And this is no fault of a store employee or anything like that.
1317232	1321236	I realize people have to do what they have to do, especially in this economy, to make a living.
1321716	1322737	But I'm just going to say...
1324598	1329219	I hope... Sometimes I really hope these rumors are true that digital distribution may kill GameStop.
1329539	1332620	And that's, again, no offense to those of you that work in the retail front.
1332980	1335621	I hope you all find other jobs somewhere else very soon.
1336021	1338761	It won't because they bought a digital distribution company.
1338781	1340482	Well, that will hopefully fail miserably.
1340602	1341742	That's what I hope.
1341862	1346123	Because the management and the uppers at GameStop clearly are just...
1346568	1346968	Assholes.
1347229	1351812	I have freedom of speech, freedom of press granted to me in the US Constitution.
1351852	1355794	I can say, in my humble opinion, GameStop management is assholes.
1356035	1358816	And I am not going to support a company run by assholes.
1360197	1360918	It's as simple as that.
1361792	1363653	I will now step off my soapbox.
1364074	1365815	But that was something that came to mind this week.
1365855	1372199	That's actually something that I wanted to address like two weeks ago, but I think it was the same week as our ninth anniversary show, so I kind of never got into it.
1372520	1377823	And now I'm not as ranty pants as I probably would have been that week.
1377964	1382287	But I'm feeling like I needed to touch on that at some point.
1382367	1384928	If you don't ever hear me talk about that store again, now you know why.
1386390	1389172	Unless it's bad news about them.
1390012	1398737	Well, I will continue to do my job of reporting on them in the most impartial way I possibly can here on the show.
1399058	1403500	You know, whether the news is good or bad, we'll continue to report on it so you guys can talk about it.
1403780	1405481	But just don't expect me to be their cheerleader.
1405501	1409904	You know, Dan's been like the recipient of like three payouts from class action lawsuits.
1410424	1410725	Really?
1410985	1411225	Yeah.
1411585	1411845	Really?
1412386	1413766	Well, I hope...
1417788	1425952	Actdeft in chat says, was it the planking thing?
1426492	1430054	I read about that where the GameStop employees got fired for doing the planking.
1430594	1434516	Believe it or not, now I can't believe I'm going to say this after my rant.
1434956	1435617	Have you heard of this?
1435717	1437278	Is that like that Pilates move?
1437378	1441462	Do you remember like in the 50s when people used to sit on flagpoles and that's what was cool?
1441482	1451450	Okay, what's cool now is to put pictures on Twitter of yourself lying dead in the most strange places, like in the middle of traffic or what these GameStop employees did.
1452530	1460637	Do a news.google search on GameStop planking and a guy is lying dead between two GameStop displays, like a plank, like a straight plank.
1460657	1462198	He was laying on top of the displays.
1462258	1464140	Yeah, he's lying on top of the displays.
1464500	1489397	And I gotta admit, even though I just chewed GameStop out there That was a real dumb thing to do, to be in your GameStop uniform and take a picture like that I mean, actually in that case, I kinda think I know why GameStop hired me I think they're allowed to do that, I gotta say Otherwise, they're assholes It's like the stewardess that put pictures of herself on the airplane, showing some cleavage
1489617	1496001	or the Disney employees at Euro Disney that were all in the costumes and they were doing nasty things backstage.
1496201	1498283	Don't put that shit on the internet.
1498983	1502346	If you're gonna do it, keep it on your phone and laugh at a party or something.
1502386	1503366	Don't put it on the internet.
1503386	1504327	That was the dumb thing they did.
1504347	1507289	Keep in mind, my experience with planking has to do with Pilates.
1509062	1509843	Oh, here we go.
1509863	1510424	Actdeft.
1510584	1514508	See, this is why I love having a live chat because chat will actually link us to these things live.
1514969	1516530	So there you go.
1516570	1519714	I'm going to bring this up so you can see the picture here, DarkSakura.
1520094	1521316	I've got it up too.
1521636	1525260	I can't believe... Oh, Spazinator in chat tells me that flagpole sitting was in the 1920s.
1525300	1525520	Actually...
1528703	1531125	That was, um... I thought it was the 50s.
1531365	1531545	No.
1531985	1536428	Okay, then Swallowing Goldfish, or... Oh, this is actually kind of cool.
1537589	1538870	Why, you like that?
1539570	1541071	I think that's ridiculous.
1541131	1544013	Well, I mean, it is ridiculous, but it's kind of neat.
1544053	1545914	That's some good abdominal control.
1546095	1548056	And as I've complained about...
1548436	1550658	You're the most unpredictable woman I've ever met.
1550758	1550958	Okay.
1551018	1553760	And that is saying a lot because most women are unpredictable.
1554260	1556262	This is, this is retarded.
1556722	1557002	I'm sorry.
1557302	1557683	Stupid.
1557703	1561085	I've been told not to say retarded by my wife.
1561425	1562846	You might have been retarded people.
1563186	1563547	Whatever.
1563607	1566329	Well, you should cut back on that quite frankly, but.
1566989	1567209	Okay.
1567369	1568530	I'm not going to tell you what you can and can't say.
1568550	1569391	It is incredibly stupid.
1569451	1572493	I mean, this, Konin, which is the new thing where you.
1572513	1573694	You're offending stupid people.
1573934	1578660	Where you go through the drive-thru, order an ice cream cone, and then you grab the ice cream off the cone.
1578861	1579762	Who cares?
1580222	1581784	I would just think you're stupid.
1582425	1583507	Good job, man!
1584468	1585249	Ah, you're smart.
1585309	1585930	Wait, wait, tell me that.
1586210	1587011	What is coning?
1588012	1591076	You get an ice cream cone, and then someone else runs by and takes the ice cream off the cone?
1591096	1591777	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1592298	1593499	Thanks for watching!
1613410	1618472	Yes, this is what... These are the people that will be voters someday.
1618812	1621973	If they're not already, thank you for ruining the world.
1622373	1624834	I thought that was called fire in the hole.
1625014	1626194	That's what people did.
1626694	1630596	And that actually was not cool because somebody got burned over that whole thing.
1630616	1636558	But the fire in the hole is where you go through a drive-thru and you order the combo meal and then you yell fire in the hole and throw the soda.
1638358	1639399	Not through the window.
1639679	1643381	But some asshole did it with coffee and burned some guy.
1643761	1644842	That is actually not funny.
1645002	1645682	Well, of course.
1645842	1648964	It always takes stupider people to ruin everything.
1649184	1651105	And then there's a new thing called owling.
1651445	1654647	I would demonstrate owling, except I don't know if this chair would hold me.
1655047	1661190	But owling is basically where you kind of squat down on top of something like you're a stupid owl.
1661550	1662591	And then you take a picture of it.
1662631	1665032	Because, you know, planking wasn't dumb enough.
1665472	1666633	So the people have to...
1667333	1668975	Come up with even dumber things.
1669215	1669695	I don't know.
1669815	1672998	It's just stupid.
1673799	1675620	The internet makes people stupid.
1676922	1677562	We have proof.
1679764	1691294	So anyway, I didn't mean to get... You're not supposed to... After I do a rant like that on GameStop, you're not supposed to give me a news article where I agree with one of their crappy management decisions.
1692495	1694177	They also fired the person that took the picture.
1698044	1699286	I think it's justified.
1699346	1703871	I hate to say it, but you're there to work, not to do fucking planking photos.
1703891	1708535	Well, I can't make my fellow employee do his job if he wants to go lay down on something.
1708976	1714682	I'm taking the picture to expedite this whole retarded, stupid thing that he is doing.
1714942	1715142	Mm-hmm.
1716263	1740396	well okay but let me put it this way let me put it this way let's say those employees leave their position at GameStop and go plank somewhere else and GameStop threatens to do things to them because they've done things after the fact that's kind of what's going on in another situation right now and that's why I think it's just just icky so that's all I'm gonna say
1742731	1743532	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
1765369	1767731	Oh, I can't wait to see where we're going to start tonight.
1768772	1770694	What is the internet talking about tonight?
1771034	1781503	Let's talk about a wonderful game that was highly anticipated, made by Capcom, long-awaited sequel to Mega Man Legends.
1782304	1789810	Mega Man Legends 3, this project that they were also kind of getting input from the fans themselves to help them create this game.
1790871	1791811	They said, you know what?
1793732	1796233	And we're not going to put it up.
1796273	1804575	Originally, they were going to have this prototype version that was going to hit the eShop and you're going to be able to download it.
1804915	1809556	And then they started doing this crap like, well, not a lot of people download this game.
1809596	1810476	We're not going to make it.
1811017	1816098	And then now they're like, well, there's not enough systems that sold, so we're not going to make it.
1817579	1831398	Basically, the actual quote, I guess, is, Unfortunately, it was not felt that the Mega Man Legends 3 project met the required criteria to go into full productions, and thus it was pulled.
1835145	1841648	and apparently they're saying there's a fan campaign going on now to get people, you know, get them to put this game out.
1842468	1843649	I have a few problems with this.
1844269	1848691	One... Not to be rude, but that fan campaign will be about as effective as the mother fan campaign.
1849031	1849331	Sorry.
1850405	1874223	uh number one um who told Capcom to fucking put it on 3ds anyways I mean that's risky you're you're kind of assuming well it's a Nintendo system it's gonna sell incredibly well but what happens if it if it doesn't they're like what do you mean what if it happens if it doesn't it's a Nintendo system it's gonna sell incredibly well I mean that's kind of their logic there and then when it didn't they're like crap um
1876523	1879467	I don't understand why they just don't put it out on their system.
1879507	1890502	I mean, God, it can't be that hard to port a PlayStation 1 looking game onto another system like Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, WiiWare...
1890842	1911171	you've always been quite the fan of Mega Man Legends haven't you because I remember earlier episodes of the show and I mean like early in the first few years of the show where you were talking about how much you love those games and you always wish they'd make a third one so now here it is Capcom's gonna make a third one and then oh well you know what and it was one of the reasons I got a 3DS granted not one of the top reasons I got a 3DS
1913072	1919596	But at this point, I'll take any reason to justify getting a 3DS because there's not many reasons out there.
1919656	1928121	But it's one of those things, it's seriously stupid because this is one of the games, oh yeah, the fans wanted this and we're going to take all this fan support.
1928361	1930642	Then they're like, well, we didn't get a lot of support on this.
1932483	1935025	So they're gonna give... They're gonna abort.
1935085	1938388	They're gonna have a live abortion of Mega Man and make all their fans watch.
1938408	1938808	Yeah, I love it.
1938968	1943952	We didn't get enough support on the forums for this, you know, voting processing.
1945233	1946434	I'm sorry, but...
1948030	1949451	You're the fucking game developer.
1949471	1952172	Why do you need people to input on the game?
1952373	1955494	Well, we didn't get enough input on the game, so we don't know what to do.
1956075	1964179	What do you do in the situation where you don't ask the fans what they want, and you just, I don't know, create, develop, if you will, the game?
1964780	1968942	The crowdsourcing was not up to our expectations, so we fired all the employees.
1969202	1969422	You.
1969722	1970863	It was stupid.
1971223	1974425	It's just Capcom being Capcom now.
1974625	1976086	I'm sorry, but Capcom's kind of...
1976989	1977990	I don't know what they're doing.
1978890	1982433	I think some people higher up are making really dumb decisions.
1992345	1995686	Well, that's awesome.
1995726	1997267	Yeah, let's shove it in his face.
1998907	2000248	Yeah, that'll show the fans.
2003569	2004549	I don't see the point.
2004829	2010491	Do you think there could be, to play devil's advocate here a little bit, could there be legitimate concern on Capcom's part
2010931	2011771	And so therefore it's not worth...
2030376	2057991	they've done more retarded things like they put out the Mega Man powered up Mega Man game on the PSP and they did the Mega Man I think there was a Mega Man X kind of remake thing on the PSP as well that I mean the PSP it didn't have that many people that bought it and in a game like that especially where it's just a remake of the first Mega Man game not a lot of people really cared about that even though it was kind of cool they had a level editor and stuff like that
2058491	2059292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2075560	2093231	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and 2 and you know there's cameos from the Servbot characters are everywhere like you know and Dead Rising and all that stuff and people love Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and Tatsunoko vs. Capcom I mean they're definitely around there it's just
2094712	2096434	I don't know, it's just kind of stupid.
2097175	2099697	There's some games you just put out to make the fans happy.
2099857	2108364	Granted, you're not going to make a lot of money on it, but I'm sorry, but when you're not really marketing this game, you're not really...
2109745	2110426	Thank you for watching!
2129361	2140288	The problem with porting a game like Mega Man Legends 3 to Xbox Live and PSN versus the 3DS is because Capcom could sell it for $40 on a physical medium versus $15 on a digital-only medium.
2141308	2145191	TheRobD in our chatroom says, Reasons why Capcom probably canceled Mega Man Legends 3.
2146191	2148393	Not many people liked Mega Man Legends 1 and 2.
2148973	2150274	Inafune left.
2150294	2151334	3DS didn't sell well.
2151715	2152675	Lack of fan demand.
2152935	2153896	Pick any of those reasons.
2154036	2154817	All of them are valid.
2155157	2158839	That said, with the fan support they were asking for, they should have released the game.
2158959	2161061	Who said that they couldn't put it on a physical medium?
2161281	2165344	I mean, they could have easily done that and put it out as a disc sell for 40 bucks.
2165664	2167286	I mean, people would have eaten it up.
2167426	2171609	Oh yeah, especially if they'd released it as a budget title, quote unquote, or it was like $29.99.
2172049	2173290	It would have sold like crazy, I think.
2174311	2181241	and you could do download content later on because everyone's about download content but Capcom just doesn't get it.
2181441	2185987	I know we're going to be talking about some other stuff from Capcom but let's look at what they're doing.
2187008	2189311	Here's their good ideas that they have.
2189932	2190753	Death Rising 2 Death Rising 2
2205729	2206890	I mean, that's kind of dumb.
2207470	2212715	And then you have, you know, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2213655	2223483	It's like, well, you know, we were going to offer download content for the first game, and we charged a buttload for a couple of them, and then we said, fuck you!
2223984	2225164	You buy a disc now.
2225885	2226185	So...
2228627	2231930	and then all the stuff that they're doing on the IOS marketplace.
2232370	2233691	Their crappy DRM.
2233911	2236213	I mean, there's just a lot of really bad decisions.
2237994	2240596	And we see this similar type of trend with other companies.
2240696	2243018	I mean, Activision, for example.
2245599	2247921	They just kind of have to have a reality check for a little bit.
2248141	2253105	Oh, and let's not forget to mention Devil May Cry, how they're rebooting that franchise.
2254886	2256567	I don't even know what they're doing to Dante.
2256627	2257448	It's just ridiculous.
2257796	2264240	Could it maybe be that it's not so much the news that they've cancelled the project, but it was kind of the way they delivered the news?
2264660	2271244	Like, part of me thinks, especially seeing in our chatroom that there are some people that are kind of sympathetic to why Capcom cancelled Mega Man Universe.
2272685	2273926	Well, Mega Man Legends 3, actually.
2273946	2275187	There's another comment on Mega Man Universe.
2275847	2277268	Don't forget that project was cancelled, too.
2277568	2278549	I'll come back to that in a minute.
2279209	2293785	but see that's the point could it be the way they handled it like you know Netflix took a lot of crap a couple weeks ago for the way they handled the news about the price increase to Netflix service could maybe Capcom have handled this a little better well I mean
2296089	2296689	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2319798	2333691	that that strikes me as odd like that they talked about this whole way you better buy the prototype if you want the game type essentially is what they're saying without saying it and now they've just canned the whole thing they're not even gonna let the prototype come out that strikes me as very like just
2335416	2336257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2361833	2367715	You know, it's just, I wasn't that, I mean, I thought it was cool, but I wasn't super psyched.
2367755	2386741	I mean, it would have been nice to have a game that I was kind of looking forward to on the 3DS, but I've just kind of come to accept that the stuff on the 3DS, there's just a lot of the stuff I was looking forward to, and trust me, there's been already three games canceled on the 3DS, including Mega Man Legends 3 that I was looking forward to for the 3DS.
2387121	2390622	Saints Row on the 3DS, and DJ Hero on the 3DS, all of those have
2390802	2393684	Well, DJ Hero's not surprising, though, considering what went on over there.
2393724	2402811	I understand that, but these were all games that kind of sold me on a 3DS, other than, you know, Kid Icarus looks pretty awesome.
2403011	2408355	I think Nintendo's going to recover a little bit come Christmas time, though, and I think some of these companies might regret it, you know?
2409035	2409796	I don't know, but we'll see.
2410076	2412577	I want to read some other comments in chat because some of these are really good here.
2413178	2414459	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says,
2432890	2453084	well, you can't say Mega Man Universe or the Mega Man Universe was completely omitted because Trombon's a character and Servbots show up there but I also, I will admit I had a similar train of thought is that this whole stuff had me thinking as I thought about, well gee, they cancelled Mega Man Universe 2 and now they've cancelled this and I thought, how come we never got a Mega Man 11?
2454605	2462431	Mega Man 9 obviously did crazy good Mega Man 10 I think did alright but I think a lot of people were just like, okay, jokes getting old now
2462711	2463772	But, like, I'm a little worried.
2463812	2467775	Like, does this mean Mega Man at all is done for now?
2467835	2471157	I mean, I realize the creators left Capcom, so that's a very distinct possibility.
2471177	2471778	But it's a big deal.
2471798	2473639	We had Katamari games without the creator being there.
2473679	2477522	I mean, it's... And none of them really were as good as the original.
2477542	2478823	Well, that's because they didn't try.
2479203	2483946	But, you know, the whole point is, is it that they can't make any of these games or they're just not?
2484106	2489110	I mean, because if they're not, I don't understand... I mean, get over your guy themselves.
2489430	2491412	You know, if you're just like, well, we don't want his character...
2492372	2493193	He left us.
2494234	2495075	He left us.
2495435	2496195	Oh, sad.
2496336	2497537	I mean, get over yourself.
2497677	2499438	Mega Man's an iconic character.
2499458	2503241	I would think I would be challenged to make the best Mega Man game we've ever made.
2503701	2508786	If you really want to get at him, make the best Mega Man game that anyone's ever seen.
2508806	2509926	We don't need you anymore.
2510967	2513209	I mean, but... But they did.
2514230	2514870	They do need him.
2515011	2516792	That's essentially what they're admitting.
2517733	2517953	Right?
2518794	2519234	I guess.
2520215	2520475	All right.
2521898	2525319	Ah, let's move on with some more gaming news, I suppose.
2525359	2536062	Of course, you can always join our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, where a lot of folks kind of going back and forth on this, talking a little bit about the Twitter and how the announcement was handled there on Twitter.
2536162	2539863	I did not see this, but I guess it was pretty harsh on the Europe Twitter anyway.
2540763	2541063	Yikes.
2542183	2543744	All right, more gaming news here.
2544124	2548145	This is a rumor that's been confirmed to be true, and it has to do with...
2548945	2555871	GoldenEye Reloaded, we saw a listing for this on Amazon.com a couple weeks ago and it turns out it is true.
2556192	2559214	The GoldenEye remake is coming out on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
2559815	2561897	Some screenshots were released earlier this week.
2562777	2571745	It is interesting because the game press release didn't even mention the Nintendo 64 original or last year's Wii game.
2572506	2572987	Interesting.
2573367	2575068	But nevertheless, the game is coming out.
2575469	2578931	Daniel Craig is still playing Bond, not Pierce Brosnan.
2579712	2582574	Activision says that the game will run at 60 frames a second.
2582675	2586097	It will support the PlayStation Move sharpshooter gun controller.
2586718	2587198	Interesting.
2588920	2589760	So there you go.
2589780	2592323	It's also going to support 16 players online.
2592363	2593463	The Wii version only supported 8.
2594164	2597167	They're saying more maps, weapons, characters, and game modes.
2598127	2598628	Interesting.
2598988	2599188	I concur.
2599208	2600548	That's really, I think, what our issue with that would be.
2621075	2623557	Yeah, it's going to really be the price that this comes out.
2624318	2628883	And I'm not seeing a price here on the list, so I guess we just have to assume it's probably going to be full price.
2630244	2630824	Most likely.
2631909	2640036	Just hopefully they're smart enough not to release it like a week before Modern Warfare 3 comes out, like the last, you know, Bond game.
2640276	2642778	Release dates are really crucial in gaming.
2642858	2645680	I think that's something we're kind of coming to learn over the past couple years.
2645760	2646541	I mean, come on.
2646861	2648963	Activision, get your shit together.
2649223	2652445	You know that you have Modern Warfare 3 coming out the week after.
2652766	2660152	You may think, huh, you know, if we put this game out a week before, we're only going to get maybe one week to have sales because everyone's going to go, oh my god.
2661212	2663853	Modern Warfare 3, who gives a shit about buying this?
2665214	2668735	Honestly, this is a game, this Goldeneye Reloaded is a game that should be out now.
2669396	2672117	It should have come out now, because what do we have right now?
2672457	2672737	Nothing.
2673077	2673917	Right now, nothing.
2674598	2680420	I mean, and yes, I realize they want to get a lot of the Christmas sales and so forth, but at the same time, you've got to be real.
2681020	2683341	Look at why the one on the Wii didn't do so well.
2683361	2686743	You can't put that out this holiday, because you've got, you know, let's...
2687543	2688924	Let's start with September.
2688944	2691284	You've got Gears 3 and Resistance 3 coming out.
2691704	2694945	You've got the following month Battlefield 3 coming out.
2694965	2696586	And then you have Modern Warfare 3.
2697206	2698687	It's just going to get lost.
2699287	2705289	You need to really put that out either in August or you're going to have to wait until winter.
2706309	2708630	Don't worry about getting it out for holiday.
2709250	2710291	Or put it out in December.
2712271	2713372	Because there's nothing in December.
2713392	2714552	Nothing.
2714572	2714812	Nothing.
2715919	2719921	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.orangepontrader.com says, I already played the Wii version.
2719981	2721122	No need to play it again.
2721662	2726004	But 16 players online and new characters and new maps and HD.
2726205	2726465	OMG.
2728007	2728907	Oh, sign me up.
2729108	2736751	It would be really hard to ask somebody to pay $60 twice, though, because the Wii was probably only about $50, but if this one's full price, it'll be $60.
2736871	2742714	It's going to be hard to ask somebody to pay that twice, especially for what was essentially a remake of an old game.
2742914	2745975	I'd rather see an HD remake of TimeSplitters 2.
2747556	2748396	And why that game?
2748576	2749917	Because that game is awesome.
2750357	2752558	Even TimeSplitters Future Perfect would be awesome.
2753438	2754599	It was such a great shooter.
2754979	2755099	Mm-hmm.
2756454	2756716	Alright.
2757259	2758446	Well, let's move on with some more news.
2758486	2759833	DarkSakura, what do you have for us tonight?
2760433	2764115	Well, we have some news about Google+, actually.
2765176	2769398	They have said that they're going to be getting some gaming features soon.
2769438	2770959	It's actually on the Help page.
2772220	2780745	According to a few sources, they say that they're going to do something called GameStream, where you can check for updates on the games that you're playing.
2781786	2786649	And actually, when it was on there, the link to it now is a 404.
2788795	2788915	Oh.
2789215	2799502	So, but it said that there are some things in the source code that are games get game friends, games get activities, and games post to stream.
2800502	2801163	So, hmm?
2803089	2812772	Well, I mean, this is kind of a duh, especially if you think about that we had news before that Google had invested in Zynga a couple months ago.
2812972	2814412	Actually, it was maybe more like six months ago.
2814713	2817373	They'd invested, what, like $100 million in Zynga?
2817993	2822715	So, I mean, the fact that games are going to come to Google is a bit of a duh.
2823095	2823315	Yeah.
2823596	2830042	But, you know, A, it's about how soon and I think the question that really has everyone wondering is how are they going to implement it?
2830382	2832684	Because this could really make or break Google+.
2833305	2836648	A lot of folks are really excited about Google+, right now.
2836728	2836989	Why?
2837029	2837950	Because it's not Facebook.
2838770	2868097	and what Google Plus is doing right is that they're giving people a lot of what Facebook has been very slow or very stubborn to give and that is a decent mobile app for starters once Apple finally approved it let's see they have given folks the control total control over well I shouldn't say total because there's some things about the privacy that even frustrate me too in the pictures department but like you have to have a public profile to keep your account as of the end of the month
2869033	2869453	Oh really?
2869713	2885301	Yes, actually as of the 27th Interesting I posted that on Google Plus Oh, I missed it But yeah, they said if you're You're in a circle with people I don't read their stuff I'm kidding, I just missed it It can be as little as just your name Yeah But you have to have a public profile
2885541	2888482	I think I, well, I thought you just kind of had one by default.
2888542	2890302	It's kind of like Facebook.
2890642	2900065	You have a profile, but as long as, you know, you lock everything down, nobody sees anything but your name and your default picture, which doesn't have to be you.
2900245	2901565	Yeah, I think that's it.
2901645	2907067	But I mean, but they're saying that for people who have them fully private, then their Google Plus accounts are getting wiped.
2908187	2909288	No, they wouldn't wipe.
2909728	2910328	That's what it said.
2910348	2912729	Well, wouldn't you just change it from private or something?
2912769	2914010	That seems a little ridiculous.
2914050	2914550	Hold a second.
2914650	2915271	I will get it for you.
2915371	2915671	All right.
2915831	2917272	Yeah, share the story because I'm curious about that.
2917652	2922274	So then Google might damn themselves on all these, you know, hey, we're going to do privacy right.
2922354	2923815	And then, oh, well, we're not.
2924495	2926076	That seems a little bit ridiculous to me.
2926136	2926456	I don't know.
2926806	2927146	Here it is.
2928806	2939829	It says, and this is under the Google Plus project area, public profiles, the purpose of Google profiles is to enable you to manage your online identity.
2940229	2942169	Today, nearly all Google profiles are public.
2942510	2947651	We believe that using Google profiles to help people find and connect with you online is how the product is best used.
2948131	2953412	Private profiles don't allow for this, so we have decided to require all profiles to be public.
2953952	2958717	Keep in mind that your full name is the only required information that will be displayed in your profile.
2958997	2961959	You'll be able to edit or remove any other information you don't want to share.
2962420	2968685	If you currently have a private profile but you do not wish to make your profile public, you can delete your profile or you can simply do nothing.
2968766	2971408	All private profiles will be deleted after July 31st, 2011.
2972249	2974411	That doesn't seem any worse than what Facebook does.
2974831	2979095	I mean because, okay, so you can have your name and a picture of your cat.
2981739	2984184	I mean, that doesn't seem so terrible to me.
2984915	3011762	But there are people that are getting kind of Well, because it's a step backwards for Google I think a little bit in the privacy area where everybody's been really I think it kind of feels a little bit like a slap or a step back when everybody's been very rah, rah, rah Circles are the right thing to do Circles are amazing It's the whole reason why Google Plus works Circles are this year's squares Yes, circles are this year's squares Exactly
3012222	3024418	So as far as going back to the games implementation though, I think a lot of people are nervous about how are they going to implement games because one reason that people hate Facebook is that they hate the so-and-so is growing bullshit on their farm.
3024478	3025800	Why don't you come farm with them?
3026521	3027382	And all the invites...
3027822	3031824	One thing I'm glad though, on Facebook, they have at least do hide all posts by.
3032184	3036906	Yeah, and Facebook, I will say a lot of that got better, but it took a long time for that to happen.
3037387	3040908	And so the question is, how's Google going to implement it, especially if they have a stake in Zynga?
3041248	3048572	Now, based off of the stuff that's leaked out, it sounds like a gameplay stream will be a totally separate thing.
3048932	3052254	that you would have to click on to view just the game posts.
3052534	3054216	And I think that's a great way to do it.
3054616	3060019	That way it keeps it out of my main feed where people are posting cute pictures of their cat and status updates.
3060319	3065483	And it just puts it in a place where if I feel like playing a game, then I'll click on that stream and see what's going on.
3066543	3070466	But I don't always, believe it or not, I don't always feel like playing a game when I go online.
3071038	3073239	And believe it or not, I don't always care what other people are playing.
3073879	3074420	Exactly.
3074740	3076360	Especially my mother in Farmville.
3076721	3079802	And believe it or not, everybody that sends me an invite for a game, I deny it.
3080662	3090907	Oh, and all those people, I wish that, this is one thing I wish Facebook had, to have an option where send everyone who sends you an invite a message saying, knock it off.
3092916	3098478	And another interesting comment from BlackWolf in our chat room, and this is something I have thought about before, so I guess I'll address it now.
3098818	3103440	BlackWolf says, Sky, one other thing to realize is that they insist on you using your real name.
3103881	3105381	If you use a pseudonym, i.e.
3105481	3108562	you and me, we are at risk of being suspended from Google+.
3108923	3112484	And to get unsuspended, you would need to send them a photocopy of your government-issued ID.
3112904	3113625	Well, here's the thing.
3113785	3121648	I think most of the reason why they're doing that is they're trying to keep the businesses out of profiles right now, and that my name on there isn't fuckyou.
3122668	3125710	If my name was Rob Fuck You, I think they might have a problem with that.
3126230	3133333	I think the way I'm doing it on there and the way you're doing it on there, we're kind of okay because we're people that are just trying to protect our privacy.
3133633	3137795	Because I think podcasters can be in a very unique situation sometimes.
3137815	3142757	And I've talked about violations that have happened to my privacy before and how alarming that can be.
3142797	3145778	I don't want to get into that whole spiel before, but it's scary until you've been there.
3146198	3163540	so here's my thing if Google Plus cancels my account fine I'll stop using it I'm not going to sign up under my real name period but my life will go on without a Google Plus I won't talk about it on this show I'll make my friends go to another website if they want to see my pictures and give another company the ad dollars or what have you like
3164301	3190676	I am not required to use this website I think it's pretty cool and I'd like to keep using it but there's just some things I'm not going to bend on and what would infuriate me is if Lady Gaga gets a profile on Google Plus that will infuriate me if Lady Gaga gets to have a profile and I would get mine removed because I have to use a fake last name to protect myself from stalkers then that would piss me off
3191736	3192817	because that's a double standard.
3192937	3197221	How come Lady Gaga gets to have a Google Plus profile and not Stephanie Germanotta?
3197661	3198522	That would piss me off.
3199303	3200364	Absolutely would piss me off.
3200464	3204247	Or any other celebrity that doesn't go by their real name, which is most of them.
3205128	3206970	Cher's name isn't Cher, you guys.
3207030	3207890	Madonna's name.
3207910	3209192	Actually, I think her name is Madonna.
3209232	3210853	Katy Perry isn't even Katy Perry.
3210913	3212294	Katy Perry is not Katy Perry.
3212314	3215997	Look at actors like David Tennant couldn't register under his real name.
3216198	3216398	Mm-hmm.
3216778	3221521	because there was another actor with that name registered with the Actors Guild in the UK.
3222042	3225844	The greatest rock star singer of all fucking time.
3226324	3226545	No.
3226985	3229447	Freddie Mercury was not his real name either.
3229667	3232008	Well, Ringo Starr wasn't his name, but he had to legally change.
3232649	3233509	So, there you go.
3235391	3237872	I like how someone in chat changed their name to Rob Fuck You.
3239914	3244817	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.org.com says, Rob Fuck You from fucking Austria?
3244837	3244917	Yeah.
3246063	3247405	You know what I would like?
3248686	3252150	Yeah, you have to register your real name, but you can choose a pseudonym.
3252911	3254272	That would be great.
3254472	3255273	That would be great.
3257235	3261139	And Ranma in chat says, Sky, but what if she legally changes her name to Lady Gaga?
3261159	3261580	She hasn't.
3262861	3263682	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3285080	3288282	Most people I meet don't realize I have a different last name.
3288582	3293826	But I have to use a different last name on the radio to protect the things I do from 8 to 5 Monday through Friday.
3294126	3300250	I'm sorry, but I'm not sharing the details of my job and my life and how I pay my rent and eat.
3300590	3301391	Because guess what?
3301471	3302732	This show doesn't do that.
3303092	3306754	Nor any podcast that you listen to unless it's maybe Adam Carolla.
3307415	3309136	Podcasts will not feed somebody.
3309236	3313319	If someone gives me a job in exchange for me having to blog about it, then I would do that.
3313339	3313639	Yeah.
3314159	3325604	If you want to pay me six digits a year to do this show, or you want us to start charging a subscription fee so that we start making six digits a year off this show, which I still wouldn't think would happen, then I'll happily use my real last name.
3327785	3330406	But that's, you know, that's where it's at.
3332987	3338351	All right, anyhow, I didn't mean this to turn into like a stalker privacy conversation, but yeah, games on Google+.
3338631	3341514	Will you play games on Google+, let me ask that.
3341974	3357246	I would think if Google has a $100 million stake in Zynga, I think Zynga has a hot new game that they're going to have exclusive on Google+, and I'm talking like Farmville 2 will be like a big land for Google+, which is going to make a lot of people eye roll.
3357546	3360987	But if they launch it the right way, it won't piss everybody off.
3361747	3366249	If they make it so that it's not in your face, people will be fine.
3366289	3367849	But this could make or break Google+.
3368169	3373691	If it's all over and it's Facebook all over again, people will just go right back to Facebook because they have their network built up there.
3373711	3379153	Well, obviously, they have a huge stake in this because with Apple going with big integration with –
3379693	3393832	Twitter, and I'm assuming at some point Facebook or something like that, the Android iOS, or the Android OS, I guess, is going with Google+, since it's a Google-based operating system.
3393872	3394473	It makes sense.
3396690	3398791	Yeah, it has the phrase on here.
3398871	3402252	If you're looking for updates shared from games, check out your game stream.
3402993	3405574	So let's hope it's all hidden in there.
3405594	3406194	That would be great.
3406794	3409035	Because I wouldn't mind playing Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on Google.
3409135	3410215	That would be kind of fun, actually.
3411336	3419739	Well, the whole reason I stopped playing a lot of those stuff, and that's actually why I haven't signed up for Turntable yet, is because Turntable requires you to link through your Facebook.
3420419	3422720	And I don't like all those apps associated with my Facebook.
3423476	3424257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3438516	3450180	and I don't want to, I've seen a lot of people who've signed up for things that I might have been interested in and later on it uses, it'll tag them as a way to advertise their stuff because the tag will show up on your friend's feed.
3450380	3450560	Right.
3451280	3453821	And I don't want to be used for something that they're not paying me for.
3454241	3454421	Right.
3454822	3462864	I gotta say though, I chose to go ahead and go into Turntable FM and I gotta say, that is a rad, it's way better than Spotify.
3463304	3464965	Turntable FM is awesome.
3465362	3468588	Well, I also read something about the legalities, how they're getting away with it.
3469159	3471081	Yeah, yeah, somebody had posted that to my wall.
3471201	3474944	If you haven't seen Turntable FM, how can I explain Turntable FM real quick?
3474984	3480528	It's basically like you and your friends get to play DJ and you can't go in a room by yourself.
3480588	3481669	That's the important thing to know.
3482009	3483270	You can, but you can't do anything.
3483670	3492637	Once a friend signs up and it's you and a friend, you can set a queue of songs to play and it'll basically go down the line of up to five DJs and play the next song on your playlist.
3493117	3496720	And it sounds so simple, but the great thing about it...
3500284	3501786	After that whole thing you just said?
3502226	3503027	Well, yeah.
3503107	3503388	Liar.
3503848	3506151	No, I'm not a liar, but that's why I'm not doing the games.
3507513	3507853	No, I know.
3508034	3510317	And you can always go revoke its permissions at any time.
3510357	3511318	That's the other thing to keep in mind.
3511338	3514902	Which I spent like an hour doing because the stupid quizzes count as apps.
3515123	3515403	Oh, yeah.
3515663	3515864	Oh, yeah.
3516224	3533376	so no one's in right now so you would be going into random rooms but like if any of your friends were DJing their little pictures would show up on the right hand side and you go into rooms and just it goes down the line and up to five people just it goes into their playlist and it sounds so simple ooh they're playing Fuel I'm going to the 90s mix it's an awesome way to discover new music
3534176	3535716	It is an awesome way to discover new music.
3535756	3541318	Me and a couple of my WoW guildies were in there the other night just playing random music that we like and it was cool.
3541958	3543579	Hey, have you guys heard this song?
3543959	3544479	And it comes up next.
3544659	3547060	And yeah, the legalities, highly questionable.
3547100	3550440	This website probably won't be around in a year, but I'm going to enjoy it while I can.
3551721	3552161	There you go.
3553263	3555545	Alright, let's move on.
3555625	3559067	God, we keep bringing up stories and then it just turns into something else completely.
3559588	3560509	There, it's on there.
3560529	3563091	Everyone has to put up with my music.
3563291	3564351	Orange Tangent Radio.
3564372	3564792	You know what?
3564992	3566613	After the show, everyone in my room.
3568340	3583526	you should name your room Pillow Fight, DarkSakura's Pillow Fight well but the thing is DarkSakura you can't the way that's set up and the way they do that legality, you can't be the sole DJ you have to be DJing with at least one other person
3584574	3585555	DarkSakura's Pillow Fight
3604784	3607146	And maybe it's going to be the next evolution of 3D.
3607286	3621856	Right now, apparently, according to an interview with Develop Magazine, Sony London Studios chief Mick Hawking is talking about some head-mounted 3D displays that they've been showing off at CES.
3622716	3629441	And they're saying that we're working with a couple games at Sony that are experimenting with virtual reality type experiences.
3630542	3634044	And it's basically saying that VR could make a comeback.
3634685	3645498	and definitely, you know, I think, yeah, maybe a little bit it could because, you know, remember back in the day, graphics on PCs, not that great.
3645879	3650184	I mean, if anyone's seen Lawnmower Man, that's pretty basic stuff.
3651185	3655607	Some of those virtual reality demos back in like 95 and stuff were hilarious.
3656027	3664550	I distinctly remember one to this day where you could either be a dude walking down the street or like in the car and it was like virtual reality.
3664570	3668451	You could walk up to these homes that were just giant blocks like it but it was it was awesome.
3668711	3670912	The whole thing looked like hard driving.
3671846	3673907	Yeah, it seriously was that basic.
3674367	3678848	And nowadays, I mean, who knows when this kind of technology will be coming out.
3679228	3682969	Just technology keeps getting way better and better each year just exponentially.
3683309	3692492	And, I mean, very well in 10 years we could be seeing some sort of 3D virtual reality technology being the kind of standard for gaming and stuff.
3692832	3696453	It's definitely within the realm of possibility, I suppose.
3697801	3701245	This could definitely, certainly, maybe happen.
3702746	3707670	It is a distinct, absolute possibility.
3709692	3713896	There is a chance out there that something like this may or may not happen.
3717179	3717419	Nice.
3720054	3720354	All right.
3721395	3724278	So moving on, I guess.
3724358	3724658	I don't know.
3725178	3729162	What Sony virtual reality stuff could they really make that would be that awesome?
3730203	3737449	Well, they could really enhance home with some virtual reality technology, too.
3737489	3737809	I don't know.
3737849	3739391	Allow more members in your clubs.
3742751	3743071	All right.
3744692	3745173	I'm trying to think.
3745213	3754719	I'm thinking back to there was a peripheral back in the Super Nintendo days that were just basically goggles you could put on your face that were just televisions literally right in front of your face.
3755060	3760043	And they called it a virtual reality headset for games like on the Super Nintendo, you know, Faceball 2000.
3760944	3762545	I played it one time.
3763826	3765667	We played a couple virtual reality games.
3765687	3768009	Well, it wasn't even really virtual reality.
3768029	3771131	It was basically, yes, monitor on my eyes type thing.
3771811	3780719	um but it was at Santa Cruz on the beach boardwalk they had a thing that you could do and you could either play Quake or Duke Nukem 3D
3783435	3783755	Awesome.
3784075	3785016	It was pretty awesome.
3786096	3786357	All right.
3787977	3788237	Go ahead.
3789058	3790518	I hate getting on all these tangents.
3790758	3792139	There's something that they have at the boardwalk.
3792159	3793480	It's called being on Orange Lounge Radio.
3793500	3793720	I know.
3793740	3793940	I know.
3794240	3796321	There's something that they have on the boardwalk now.
3796601	3798402	It's called like Safe Crackers.
3799122	3799803	Not Safe Cracker.
3799983	3807266	It's like some sort of like heist game where you go in a room and you have to dodge lasers kind of like, you know.
3807586	3809689	So you're Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment?
3809729	3810250	Yes, exactly.
3810411	3811753	Basically, you're doing that.
3813015	3813575	It's a game.
3813716	3815458	Or you're that scene out of Resident Evil.
3816809	3818030	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3841468	3843289	Catherine Zeta, Spartacus Douglas Jones
3863453	3863773	Anyhow.
3863853	3865154	No, he's not my grandfather.
3865194	3865954	He's my husband.
3868995	3869335	Anyhow.
3869835	3871796	Yes, we need to do a Santa Cruz Boardwalk show.
3871816	3872596	That would be a lot of fun.
3872676	3872936	Anyhow.
3874277	3874637	Moving on.
3875737	3880439	Talking about the Wii U. Yes, it seems like there's new Wii U news every week and it's somebody reacting to it.
3880759	3887601	This week it's Ubisoft is reacting to the Wii U. They must like it because the whole console has a capital U just like their company.
3888342	3900472	Well, they said, Yves Guillemont, who is the Ubisoft CEO, says, We feel this console is coming with very innovative features that will change the video game industry, and we want to be a part of that.
3900933	3903235	I love that you have a screen very close to you.
3903555	3907859	You can get information and send it as well, but you don't have to learn too many things.
3908880	3913924	I think it's sending the message that the new transition is going to happen, and we're going to have new machines coming soon.
3916286	3918311	That almost seems like a bad translation to me.
3918691	3921778	You get information and send it but you don't have to learn too many things.
3924620	3929602	Well, anyhow, speaking of Ubisoft, there's been some clarification, if you will, on Assassin's Creed.
3930203	3932604	It is not a port of Revelations.
3932724	3936025	The game that is coming to the Wii U is an all-new Assassin's Creed title.
3936465	3938866	It was part of the little Nintendo announcement.
3938906	3943949	They showed a clip of Assassin's Creed, but it's actually going to be an all-new title.
3944609	3947290	So, yeah, that was clarified in the interview.
3947870	3949371	So it's something new.
3950071	3950592	Who knows?
3950972	3952092	Could be Assassin's Creed 3?
3953513	3953813	We'll see.
3956499	3960402	But you'll have that screen, and you might be able to keep some information secret.
3962324	3962544	Okay.
3963204	3963384	What?
3963645	3967508	Sorry, to go back to what I was talking about before.
3967728	3973752	It's a game called The Vault, and they have a little bit of gameplay that they're showing.
3974153	3980798	It's on TV in the lobby or whatever, but you have to have these lights shining through, and you have to dodge them to get to where the vault is in the back.
3981458	3981899	Okay.
3983135	3984616	It looks like fun.
3984876	3988879	And they play, you can't hear it, but they have the Mission Impossible music playing.
3989860	3991101	That actually looks kind of rad.
3991121	3991942	I'm not even going to lie.
3991962	3992842	I kind of want to play that.
3993122	3994884	But my fat ass would hit so many lasers.
3996345	3998927	Your gigantic ass just set off five lasers.
3999007	3999927	Congratulations.
4002990	4006012	Moving on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates after this?
4007094	4011996	Well, how about the roster for Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3?
4012756	4013377	How's that sound?
4014217	4014637	Yay.
4014977	4017018	It got leaked and Capcom's not denying it.
4017118	4023381	So for Capcom, we have Strider Hear You, Firebrand, Virgil, Frank West, Phoenix Wright, and Nemesis.
4023481	4024001	Objection!
4025523	4026363	and Starz.
4049201	4051722	Two of my favorite characters on the Marvel side, I'm happy.
4051942	4054922	And my favorite character on the Capcom side, I'm happy.
4056043	4063525	Because... Well, you know, back in the day, Dan had a website called Neo Strider's Strider Zone.
4064605	4069366	He had, like, old-style, like, GeoCities-type old webpage.
4069426	4071267	And I did all the graphics for it back in the day.
4071687	4072127	Oh, wow.
4072167	4073147	When we first got together.
4073987	4074247	And so...
4077248	4090434	We actually... He totally got me into the Strider games, but now I'm a big fan of the mostly A-list, but not quite A-list, the pushing B-plus list of Marvel heroes.
4091154	4095636	So my favorite character of all time is Jessica Jones, which I know she's not going to end up in a game, but I can dream.
4096256	4100778	But now I finally get Hawkeye in a game that isn't Captain America and the Avengers.
4101698	4102559	And Iron Fist.
4103619	4105320	Iron Fist in a fighting game just makes sense.
4105942	4106122	Right.
4106803	4107203	Awesome.
4108164	4114750	What do you think, though, about the whole fact that they're putting out this ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 like not even a year after the first game came out?
4114810	4117593	I mean, isn't that kind of... The game needed tweaking.
4118473	4119474	It needed tweaking big time.
4119494	4120695	It needed free tweaking.
4124715	4130738	You have to admit, this is why people are pissed at Capcom right now about the whole Mega Man Legends 3 thing.
4130778	4133519	You get this slap in the face and then you get this slap in the face.
4133599	4134060	I don't care.
4134100	4135160	I don't think it's a slap in the face.
4135200	4135720	I'm excited.
4136181	4137921	It's a slap in the face if you bought the original.
4138021	4139322	I did buy the original and I don't care.
4139362	4140022	I want this one too.
4140222	4140543	Really?
4140703	4140883	Yeah.
4141403	4141943	I mean, I don't know.
4142163	4142603	Hawkeye!
4142783	4143324	I will say this.
4143524	4147525	I bought Street Fighter 4 on Xbox 360 and then Super Street Fighter 4 is announced.
4147565	4152247	I'm like... Alright, well, I'll get it on PlayStation 3 because at least I know it'll have a better controller.
4153347	4156028	And then... Yeah, and then the Arcade Edition comes out.
4156048	4156668	It's like another $15.
4157048	4158749	But at least that wasn't like a...
4159489	4165011	I mean, I know it was a full retail release, but at least it was compatible with Super Street Fighter.
4165031	4170272	Well, they had a DLC that you could get that basically made it to where... Tournament Stick.
4170572	4171312	Yeah, it was.
4171752	4172753	Worth the money.
4172893	4180735	They should have done that type of stuff with Marvel vs. Capcom 3, except they decided, hey, you know, we're going to be assholes and we're going to put out each character for $5 each.
4183220	4183480	No?
4183661	4184942	Well, they only had two of them.
4185082	4188586	This is actually... None of the other characters are going to be available as DLC.
4189006	4194012	They've got Shuma Garath and Jill included with this one, and then all of the rest of the characters that I named.
4194993	4200939	I think I saw something come out of Comic-Con about other downloadable characters for the game, though.
4201900	4203181	They have costumes.
4204162	4204722	Alternate costumes.
4204742	4210206	I thought there were other characters that showed up at the Comic Con that were like download content or something like that.
4210227	4214930	Well, they've also added in a spectator mode and other new playable content.
4215691	4226899	So basically, they said this, and this is a quote here from Nitsuma, said that it's about half and half between the original download content, the planned download content, and the new content.
4226999	4228761	So basically, it's like you're getting...
4233650	4241495	I would look at it as almost a new game, like half a new game with everything else that's going into it.
4241615	4243176	And honestly, that's how I'm looking at it.
4243216	4246838	I mean, you're getting as many new characters as a new fighting game.
4248198	4248759	Yes, that's true.
4249459	4251040	At least it's down to 40 bucks, too.
4251120	4254702	So those of us who didn't buy the game the first time, like me, now have a reason to.
4254722	4255963	I look at it like a sort of Rock Band 3.
4257233	4257473	Hmm.
4258094	4258314	Interesting.
4258334	4264060	You know, your old characters carry over and you get some new ones and new content, new modes.
4265533	4266053	with Rock Band 3.
4266674	4271416	All your songs carry over and you get cymbals and new modes and harmony.
4271537	4272677	And most importantly, the keyboards.
4272917	4273378	And keyboard.
4273938	4274678	You get Keyboard Cat.
4274718	4278761	Yeah, but I wouldn't exactly say it's very similar to that because Why not?
4278801	4279541	It's exactly the same.
4279821	4280081	Why not?
4280121	4282182	Because the original game is broken.
4282883	4287786	They have issues that they need to fix for the online multiplayer and they're just like, eh, we don't want to do that.
4287806	4288686	We're just going to release a new game.
4289106	4290107	Rock Band's got issues online.
4291127	4295950	I don't play online, so I honestly personally, I don't give a shit about the online play Then it's their problem
4317584	4318525	I have no problem with it.
4318805	4320006	I believe it's Capcom's problem.
4320026	4321727	Just a quick note for the live listeners only.
4322047	4322608	Fire beware.
4322848	4325870	I don't know what happened, but Winamp crashed, so unfortunately you missed that little argument.
4326470	4328651	So you'll have to tune into the podcast to hear that.
4329232	4331533	Loki and DarkSakura just got in a little heated discussion about that.
4332454	4338698	But Winamp crashed, so it's... Loki was having an uncharacteristic caring for other people, and I didn't give a shit.
4341640	4343021	It's not uncharacteristic for me.
4343101	4344082	I care about other people.
4344922	4345983	Me, myself, and I. It's...
4348621	4352284	I think the last game I played online was Fable 2 on Xbox Live I'm not sure there's going to be a patch
4377911	4379192	No, there will not be a patch.
4379212	4381993	If they're going to announce a new game, why would they fix the old game?
4383914	4384334	I agree.
4384374	4385495	The old game is done.
4386295	4389156	Now that they've announced this, there's nothing new going to come to the old game.
4389236	4391998	And back to this, it's not Capcom's fucking problem.
4392058	4393659	People are going to pay for the game.
4394079	4400342	They're going to sell it because people love Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and I love Hawkeye, so I'm getting the game.
4400822	4404944	I have to say your Rock Band comparison makes a lot of sense.
4406323	4415311	I still don't know if I would really be happy that it's all happening in the same year, but that was probably the best argument I've heard for Capcom.
4415391	4422437	I can get why people are messed up over it, and yeah, I get it, but at the same time, they're gonna make their money.
4423097	4425479	It's not Capcom's problem, it's the consumer's problem.
4425800	4429703	And the only way it's going to be made Capcom's problem is if the consumer does not follow through.
4430202	4431802	You're right, this isn't Capcom's problem.
4431842	4437744	It's just like, you know, it wasn't Activision's problem that DJ Hero 1 didn't have any download content because, you know, they decided, hey, you know what?
4437964	4444486	We're instead of, you know, supporting it with download content like we said we were, we're just going to, I don't know, put out a new game.
4444506	4448367	Well, now, Loki, there were like nine songs you could download for DJ Hero 1.
4449904	4454668	So, I mean, that was nine pieces of download content that you could get.
4455088	4458230	Or Konami and Dance Dance Revolution, you know?
4458270	4460652	Whoa, yeah, we're gonna support this game.
4460932	4466796	I know we said we're gonna support the last game with download content, but I promise you we're gonna support this game with download content.
4468398	4469999	And here's your one piece of download content.
4470559	4495861	um you know it's it's just like that or and you may remember what happened to you know Guitar Hero where there wasn't as much download content but hey you know what we released these song packs because that's what the fans want they want all their characters and all this cool spectator mode and alternate stuff because you know what um I really need an Elvis costume for my fucking characters that's really canon for Marvel um that's gonna be really awesome so
4498208	4498848	Looking forward to it.
4499089	4512518	Oh, and by the way, not to nitpick here a little bit, Capcom, but your game Street Fighter vs. Tekken, or Street Fighter X Tekken, I know that you've added other Capcom characters.
4512798	4513919	They're not part of Street Fighter.
4513979	4515099	You need to change the fucking title.
4515119	4516660	Hey, hey, hey, I'm not to that story yet.
4516700	4517281	You need to wait.
4517521	4518722	You need to sit and hold that rant.
4519462	4521083	Alright, we gotta go to some release dates.
4522204	4524826	Travel around the world to talk about what's coming out to a store near you.
4525286	4526467	Loki, start here in the U.S.,
4526960	4530118	there's not much of anything coming out this week it's pretty much
4531877	4558537	Catherine that's on a PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and of course they have the love is something some collector's edition that love is something that love is over love is over yeah love is over you can get that collector's edition that comes with boxers and a t-shirt that's pretty awesome and then of course Pac-Man and Galaga legions and
4558777	4559477	Make your cat wear them.
4582968	4586331	Yes, Pac-Man Galaga Dimensions, that's for the 3DS.
4589875	4593459	And the Sims 3 Town Life stuff expansion is going to be coming out on PC.
4595621	4597343	That's literally it.
4597843	4599325	I mean, it's that dead.
4600203	4600563	All right.
4600964	4605346	Well, then let's go to the Xbox 360 in Japan and talk about what's coming out there.
4605646	4613731	On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, Operation Flashpoint Red River comes out this week, as well as Dungeon Siege 3 gets its Japanese release this week.
4613811	4614411	That's it on the 360.
4615972	4617653	Those two games, of course, on the 28th.
4617693	4621075	Going to the PlayStation 3, Dungeon Siege 3 there as well.
4621556	4623077	Operation Flashpoint there as well.
4623137	4624417	And a game called Fit in 6.
4625458	4628839	Karada o Kiteru Siksu no Yosu
4653469	4654250	Alright, then there you go.
4655172	4659358	Going to, I want to see if there's anything on the handhelds real quick, or maybe anything in Nintendo's world.
4660379	4668711	The Sony PSP has Queensgate Spiral Chaos comes out this week in regular and limited, or I guess like a special edition.
4669471	4671012	Queensgate is an RPG.
4671533	4673154	Become the queen of a dimension.
4673494	4675255	Harness the power of the Queensgate.
4675555	4679718	The door that connects to all game worlds is taken over by someone evil and ambitious.
4680138	4684922	This game includes Mai from King of Fighters and the ladies from Queensblade.
4684962	4691086	So this is kind of like a Worlds Collide type of game where there's other chicks from other series.
4691426	4693107	And it looks like a farting maid.
4693207	4695329	That's what that looks like to me in that picture.
4696309	4697770	She's going, poot, and it says hip.
4698291	4698831	Look at that.
4699392	4700934	Who farts with the sound hip?
4701335	4701555	Hip!
4702737	4703859	Because she's swinging her hips.
4703879	4705682	She's going poop with her hips.
4705702	4707725	Be one of those loud whine poops.
4707825	4710690	Okay, that's plenty enough.
4711271	4712412	Hey, I just made it with my mouth.
4712987	4715850	Fit and Six, also coming out on the Wii in Japan, if you care.
4716310	4718492	On the 3DS, Super Pokemon Scramble.
4718512	4719694	I remember mentioning that last week.
4719734	4723818	Finally, a Pokemon game on the 3DS, even though it's not the Pokemon game.
4724698	4727982	It's Pokemon Dynasty Warriors.
4728302	4734828	And lastly, on the Nintendo DS, Devil Survivor 2 from Atlus this week on the regular DS, non-3D flavor.
4735529	4736170	Alright, how about the UK?
4737509	4738370	We have a few things.
4738891	4752569	We have on the 26th Call of Juarez the Cartel for PC and Dragon Age 2 Legacy for PS3, PC, Xbox 360 and on the 27th Project Dust from Ubisoft on Xbox 360.
4753290	4754512	That's about it.
4755553	4758495	A couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4758555	4766381	But first... But first, there was a person that had the domain for ModernWarfare3.com.
4767982	4774547	They were somewhat anonymous via GoDaddy's domains by proxy hiding surface.
4774747	4778950	We use that, by the way, for our own website.
4779750	4782873	Apparently, a domain dispute from ModernWarfare3's publisher
4783833	4786255	and Activision has dissolved that shield.
4787235	4810250	It is now apparently known that it is owned by a guy from Florida named Anthony Abram and he is now doing a bunch of random things with the website including he was at one time redirecting it to Battlefield 3's main site and also spoofing Modern Warfare 3's official site and
4811571	4812352	Thank you for watching!
4829502	4833465	Yeah, I love how that's... I mean, granted that this guy, yeah, he is a troll.
4833625	4839550	And he is... You registered the domain name because he knows that Activision is going to have a Modern Warfare 3 game at some point.
4840571	4843032	That being said, I still think he should have the website.
4843673	4850398	And just because that, you know, Activision has a game... Like, you know, for example, if I registered a website that's like...
4851699	4853460	I don't know.
4853620	4855662	AwesomeSauce.com or something like that.
4856182	4858504	Let's just assume that there's no such thing as Awesome Sauce.
4859404	4861706	Some person out there decides, hey, you know what?
4861726	4863047	Billy Mitchell will do it.
4863287	4867650	Heinz57 is going to come out with Awesome Sauce and we want that domain.
4868391	4870172	You give it to us because we want it.
4870792	4874795	I don't think that because you want something in your company that you should get that.
4877573	4880275	I think that you should have registered that domain a long time ago then.
4880715	4888362	Because, you know, Activision, I don't know what to tell you, but back when you were doing Modern Warfare 2, I could have told you that there was going to be a Modern Warfare 3.
4888462	4891425	I mean, that's just...
4892105	4892525	Dumb.
4894186	4902949	He should have done the smarter thing, and he should have had some type of club or something that was like the name Modern Warfare or something, if he wanted to be smarter about it.
4903310	4905511	Like, for instance, I remember reading about this.
4906311	4918176	The guy who owns, or at least did own, I don't know if he still does, I haven't checked it in years, but Sting.com, the musician Sting tried to sue the guy who owns it because he wanted the domain because he is the celebrity Sting.
4918516	4920177	He knows that name.
4921417	4921977	and DarkSakura.com
4945606	4947307	That he had every right to the name.
4947387	4949207	That if Sting wanted it, he should have got it first.
4949788	4955590	And, you know, I think to the argument of this guy, Modern Warfare 3, that's not the title of the game.
4955610	4956850	That's the subtitle of the game.
4956890	4958691	It's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
4959351	4961712	You know, it's not like Hello Kitty Modern Warfare 3.
4962152	4963573	It's Call of Duty.
4963673	4967034	That is, you know, if he had his website was...
4967745	4969126	Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3.
4969246	4974288	Yeah, I think there's a problem there because now you're infringing on, you know, the intellectual properties of Activision.
4974909	4975909	But this is just trolling.
4976409	4978551	It's just like, you know, Whitehouse.com.
4978591	4979451	It's a porn site.
4979851	4981012	Or it was a porn site.
4981512	4981772	You know?
4982352	4983013	Too fucking bad.
4984033	4990697	If the Whitehouse can't get a goddamn URL, then Activision should not get a goddamn URL.
4990937	4991077	I mean...
4991357	5005740	But if the guy was just trolling and has no legitimate purpose to have that title, just like these people that – like what some person sat on JuliaRoberts.com and tried to basically sell it back to her for like $10,000.
5006260	5007800	That's just embezzlement.
5007820	5008641	He's not doing that.
5008701	5010001	He's just being an asshole.
5010261	5010961	Or not embezzlement.
5011181	5011681	And you know what?
5011761	5013822	He has the right to be an asshole on the internet.
5013882	5014502	And you know what?
5015842	5016763	I don't think he does.
5017163	5018404	I think in this case.
5018464	5025349	If he has no legitimate purpose for holding that website, I don't think he... I'm just saying he wasn't smart about how he used it.
5025849	5026650	He should have used it.
5026750	5035576	If he wanted to, he could have had a dissertation about how Modern Warfare 3 is going to be a terrible game or had it be a review on Modern Warfare 3 and I think he would have had more of a say.
5036316	5054929	I don't know it just you know I think if you're not going to use it for anything worthwhile there's that committee that'll say you bring nothing good to the internet we're shutting you down SSJ100 Matt fuck you in the chat yes he changed his name to that says I'm going to register orange lounge radio 2.com
5056090	5085298	Well, okay, here's what Have fun Modern Warfare 2's official website is modernwarfare2.infinitywar.com Oh, well, I guess I can't use that anymore Oh, damn But, I mean, they have a callofduty.com They could easily do a callofduty slash modernwarfare3 or they can do mw3 since that's how it's displayed on the box I mean, there's plenty of things out there What's on that website right now if you try to go to it?
5085720	5090083	What if he did ModernWarfare3.net or something like that?
5090443	5091564	Is that going to still be an issue?
5091584	5093925	I'm going to the website right now if this autoplays anything.
5094206	5095867	Oh no, it's a totally blank page.
5098168	5099209	No source code or nothing.
5102349	5106290	ModernWarfare2.com was a website and it's a Modern Warfare 2 fan site or something.
5106350	5107750	What if I go and register ModernWarfare4.com?
5131977	5132637	What are they going to do?
5134938	5138920	But I'm going to put some stupid articles about Modern Warfare like, you know, hey, there's guns.
5139580	5146963	You should go register MegaManLegends3.com right now since you know no one else is going to use it now.
5147523	5149204	Is there a MegaManLegends3.com?
5149244	5149524	Hold on.
5154974	5155474	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5165265	5170188	That's been going on since the early .com business days too.
5170969	5172190	There's nothing new.
5172550	5174852	Those guys need to be tossed out immediately.
5175032	5179535	If I show that I have a legitimate business purpose, those guys need to get tossed.
5179575	5182237	And here's ModernWarfare4.com with a clown on it.
5183137	5185579	Welcome to ModernWarfare4.com website.
5185599	5188481	It would appear that Infinity Ward forgot to purchase this domain.
5188541	5192524	No worries, we have good... Of course, they have no spelling.
5193044	5194265	We have good care of it.
5197651	5199093	Is this an extortion plot too?
5200114	5206241	Are we breaking the story here that there is this whole time there's been a ModernWarfare4.com?
5206581	5209344	You've all been focused on Modern Warfare 3 all week?
5209945	5212087	Well, there's a Modern Warfare 4 out there.
5212107	5212968	There's not a 5.
5213128	5213889	I'm going to register 5.
5215571	5216512	Modern Warfare 5.
5216572	5217293	That's mine.
5218114	5218855	Go get it quick.
5220399	5222620	Use a GoDaddy registration code to do that.
5222720	5224541	Oh wait, we're not sponsored by GoDaddy.
5225122	5226542	That would be hilarious.
5227283	5227823	Go ahead.
5229484	5230304	Take the domain.
5232966	5233906	Could someone register?
5233946	5237008	Would somebody be willing to spend the 20 bucks to register ModernWarfare5.com?
5237068	5239949	It's not even 20 bucks, it's 10.
5240269	5239949	$10.
5240369	5242751	What would we point it to if we bought ModernWarfare5.com right now?
5242771	5243211	The Ooga Booga site.
5243231	5243331	No.
5248246	5250873	We can make some really fake looking box art or something.
5251374	5252316	Nerf fansite.
5253038	5254000	Modern Warfare with Nerf.
5255791	5256511	It's Nerf and Nerf
5280720	5287222	Well, I've actually got not just the Nerf sword, the broadsword, I have the axe and the mace.
5289423	5290723	And we have a bunch of Nerf guns.
5292183	5293204	A lot of Nerf guns.
5294044	5294684	And the orange bat.
5295685	5295985	Nice.
5297325	5298305	What about Streetfighter5.com?
5300990	5303130	No, because Capcom won't have that out for another 10 years.
5303750	5304771	Ah, see, Actdeft.
5304831	5305471	I love that thought.
5305811	5308171	Actdeft says redirect it to President Cat.
5311592	5312892	Send it to the Renowee Twitter.
5313052	5313512	Why not?
5317393	5317973	I like that.
5318573	5319753	That's actually a really good idea.
5319793	5320273	I like that.
5322094	5323434	Eason said it should go to the NRA.
5323974	5324694	Let's put it this way.
5324734	5330195	If Professor Genki is so popular in Saints Row 3, President Cat should easily be able to come out over here.
5332973	5334674	Just a footnote and word of warning.
5334734	5340755	If you register Modern Warfare 5 and give it to us to put our pictures of nerf fights on, if you get sued, that's on you.
5341055	5344416	I disavow every knowledge that this conversation ever happened.
5347537	5352938	SSJ100MattFuckYou says, Rob, we really should register a Dance Dance Revolution site and see if Konami gives a shit.
5352978	5353958	Wouldn't mind trolling them.
5355930	5362674	What if you did it as COD Modern Warfare 5 and you're fighting with cods, like fish.
5363874	5368637	Like actual trout slapping IRL, like MIRC.
5368997	5369878	It could just be pictures.
5370238	5374661	Skye slaps DarkSakura with a trout and it would be actually me slapping her with a trout.
5377202	5378223	That would be hilarious.
5378743	5380104	That would not be hilarious.
5380804	5381685	That would be smelly.
5382645	5383486	Alright, moving on.
5384051	5385912	Speaking of smelly... No, I got nothing.
5386613	5388434	We've got... Actually, this might be kind of smelly.
5388454	5392316	You know the character Poison from Final Fight?
5392557	5393457	You mean the transgender?
5394558	5395518	Is she really?
5395619	5395839	Yes.
5396739	5397880	Poison's transgender?
5398140	5398360	Yes.
5398440	5398560	What?
5398600	5404184	It actually is officially said way back in an old interview with one of the game designers.
5405565	5411148	It was supposed to be because they couldn't make her a woman in the game because it wasn't right to hit a woman.
5411289	5413370	So that's why they made her a man.
5414924	5417650	And then they changed the character sprite in the US.
5418391	5421558	And I think in other places they gave her a longer skirt and covered up her boob.
5422620	5426288	But yeah, officially Poison is supposed to be transgendered.
5426858	5427738	Dalsim, Steve Fox, Yoshimitsu
5446983	5448103	Dude, Steve Fox is kind of fun.
5448343	5449464	All announced as characters.
5449484	5452105	I wonder if Poison would whip out her dick and smack people.
5455186	5455646	You know what?
5455666	5456806	Special attack surprise.
5456946	5459167	I'm all for a diverse character lineup in the game.
5459207	5460488	But here's the thing.
5460808	5465149	Is that if it's Street Fighter cross Tekken, she's a Final Fight character.
5465309	5466370	And okay, I get it.
5466450	5469231	Like Guy, Cody, they kind of crossed over too.
5469331	5473412	But does that mean everybody from Final Fight is now part of the Street Fighter canon?
5473812	5477573	Why can't Poison be in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3?
5480094	5481194	Maybe a download character.
5481234	5481615	I don't know.
5482255	5487276	It just seems like a strange pick to me with so many characters in the Street Fighter universe.
5487316	5495259	But okay, they want to bring back or maybe somebody really wants to put... It's because they're super Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5495419	5498320	You know what sucks is now I have that song running through my head.
5499100	5500280	That Belle Biv DeVoe song.
5501741	5502201	Good lord.
5503684	5506605	Alright, moving on.
5506925	5512806	Yeah, that was at a panel, by the way, at Comic-Con 2011 where it was announced that those characters would be in the game.
5512906	5518707	And I guess Hugo, Cody, and Guy have also been teased for the game.
5518727	5523488	Well, that would make sense if Poison's in it, that Guy and Cody are going to show up at some point as well.
5523868	5526009	Gosh, I wonder how many characters this game's supposed to have.
5526569	5527149	It's crazy.
5528860	5536327	So there you go, all characters that are set to come out in Street Fighter X Tekken, which is a game that I'm pretty excited about actually.
5536347	5540771	Wasn't Chico supposed to be like Andori, who was actually based off of Andre the Giant?
5541531	5541772	Oh yeah?
5542432	5544774	But they changed his name because of the state.
5546015	5549418	Oh right, I remember those characters that looked just like Andre the Giant.
5549859	5550059	Yeah.
5551858	5552098	Funny.
5552799	5553039	All right.
5553899	5557221	Let's move on to the classic game of the week.
5557361	5558021	Yay.
5558641	5561943	Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we like to take a trip down memory lane.
5561983	5562843	Where's my theme music?
5563784	5565044	Have I lost the theme music?
5566585	5567626	This is a big deal.
5569186	5569867	Where's the theme music?
5570647	5571087	There we go.
5573328	5573568	Yay.
5573808	5576470	I was going to be in a very bad mood if I couldn't hear this happy music.
5576530	5576770	Anyway.
5577273	5585803	Classic Game of the Week is a chance for us to walk down memory lane and check out a game that DarkSakura thinks, hey, you kids should be playing this game right now.
5585963	5586844	Good luck finding one.
5588466	5590869	Well, regardless, here it is, your Classic Game of the Week.
5592299	5600647	The classic game of the week is Planet Harriers, which I brought up at the beginning of the show, and I've brought up constantly throughout past shows.
5601067	5604170	I'm finally reviewing it, because damn it, this game is awesome!
5605291	5616381	But it is part of the Space Harrier series, and it has a twin cabinet, so two people can play at the same time, or you can do a networked two-player game, and you actually play seeded.
5616961	5618523	and it's controlled through a joystick.
5618543	5624630	You have a missile and a bullet trigger and you can change your views and you have bomb buttons all on the main panel.
5625090	5626612	So you can choose either four characters.
5626752	5635201	It's Glenn, X, Corey or Nick and basically they fly on the screen and you are behind them so it's that...
5636022	5641225	Sort of third-person style, but not quite.
5641805	5645647	And then in two-player mode, you actually can dock together to save your life.
5645787	5651290	And it has the Opa-Opa in it, because you cannot have a game in the Fantasy Zone without the Opa-Opa.
5653192	5666675	So this game, a little bit more information about it is that it actually was on the Hikaru system, which was basically a double mountain.
5667255	5672336	And you don't play versus, you play as a team to clear off the screen.
5672376	5676797	And your joystick is an eight-way stick, and it's stereo sound.
5676957	5679177	And the game came out in 2001.
5679397	5681718	And you know the last place that I saw one at was at Great America?
5682678	5683779	When we went to see Margaret Cho.
5685560	5686360	They had that there?
5686480	5687181	They had that there.
5687201	5687461	Wow.
5687841	5688362	That's pretty cool.
5688922	5698307	And I remembered because, oh, the female character that you can play, basically, she wears a nurse's outfit and shoots a giant syringe as her weapon.
5699048	5707193	But it's also cool because the final boss in this game will turn into a variety of different shapes, like it'll be a fish or waves.
5707313	5709454	And one of the things it turns into is the Dreamcast logo.
5710174	5710775	The little squirrel.
5712082	5722785	But yeah, I mean, it's basically you, you know, you have obstacles in your way, and when you're actually on the ground, you're running on the ground like in Space Harrier, but when you're in the air, you're shooting.
5723386	5729128	And it's got great music, it's got great graphics for 2001, and it only ever came out in the arcade.
5729168	5732168	There was a talk of them doing a Dreamcast port.
5732389	5733069	It never happened.
5733889	5741332	which I don't see why they didn't because it would be super easy given, you know, how high the Dreamcast is basically now on me.
5742813	5752196	The other thing that I liked about this one too, and it's actually the part that you just got to in the video, Rob, is it has a shop like in Fantasy Zone.
5752596	5754177	I was going to say it reminds me of Fantasy Zone.
5754676	5767001	Yeah, so you can go in and you buy like big bombs or more speed or more shield and you use it to power yourself up as you go along because you're also collecting your points and your money as you go along too.
5767661	5778206	So it's just a really neat game and they didn't really I think make a whole lot of them and it kind of died out so there's no home version of this.
5778846	5786193	Now, I've been trying to find it emulated, and from what I understand, what was it that I downloaded today?
5787314	5795300	Apparently, the main .14164 bit runs it, but I don't think very well.
5796441	5802567	I haven't been able to find much more else about the emulation, but really that's the only way that you're probably going to be able to play it, unless you happen to know where one is.
5802987	5811177	and if you know where one is, tell me so that I can go play it I was so pissed off when we went to the Sega Arcade in Seattle to Gameworks and they did not have a Planet Harrier
5812443	5822028	I thought you were going to buy the former Sunrise Fun Center and make it your bitch and you were going to put all these great games in that place You know what, when I have money I'll be doing that
5842913	5858653	So maybe in 2035 But that is the classic game There it is, Planet Harrier Your classic game of the week The seat is plastic Your classic game of the week
5859266	5861847	Alright, we got plenty more show to go, but don't go anywhere.
5861867	5870372	We're going to be right back after this quick break with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including more news on things like Minecraft and Child of Eden on the PlayStation 3.
5870432	5872853	And then we're going to talk about Zynga getting sued.
5873334	5873874	Good times.
5874174	5878296	Of course, your calls and, so excited, a list list tonight.
5878436	5879117	Yay!
5879537	5884340	So we're going to do a list list tonight when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5890771	5913781	Welcome back everybody to episode number 421 of Orange Lounge Radio live on this July the 24th of 2011 as we are live of course every week Sunday nights at All Games Radio www.allgames.com and there's lots of great stuff you can't tune in on Sunday nights you should listen to allgames.com throughout the week there's a lot of other great shows many of them live that tape throughout the week so check that out.
5914241	5914501	DarkSakura.com
5932415	5933736	Okay, I'm equipped.
5947988	5958339	and what it's basically getting at is that there's a large LAN party that happens in Texas and it's being organized to celebrate the launch of Battlefield 3 which is this big game that's being launched and so forth.
5958999	5968269	They've decided that the best way to deal with slurs that end up getting hurled at female gamers at these events is to just prevent women from attending.
5968909	5972452	So no women will be allowed to attend this event in Texas.
5973293	5975214	Let me read a quote from the FAQ.
5975294	5979097	Hold on.
5979277	5981019	Hold on.
5981719	5993709	Quote, Nothing ruins a good LAN party like uncomfortable guests or lots of tension, both of which can result from mixing immature, misogynistic male gamers with female counterparts.
5994229	5999430	Though we've done our best to avoid these situations in years past, we've certainly had our share of problems.
5999990	6003251	As a result, we no longer allow women to attend the event.
6004671	6008352	Now, thoughts so far before I read the update.
6008412	6009113	I will be fair.
6009493	6013834	This paragraph has since been changed, but let's hear DarkSakura's initial reaction to this.
6013854	6023896	If they're a private organization and then they do have the right as a private organization, however,
6026178	6027579	You have the right to call them dickheads.
6046343	6048845	Outside of the box.
6049346	6051307	Just go for, well, this will be this way.
6051327	6052608	We just won't have chicks there, huh?
6052768	6056051	Well, for this whole weekend, they will all be thinking outside of the box.
6056311	6059314	Because there will be no boxes at this event, if you know what I mean.
6060835	6067240	Well, this is why, sorry, but this is why male geeks get a bad rep.
6069102	6070423	You are afraid of us.
6071444	6075207	And so, when we kick your ass, you have to resort to name-calling.
6077122	6091350	Like you do when some noob kicks your ass It's just immaturity is all it is They just name call everybody And it's the women that get upset about it Maybe if women would cry less they'd get invited to these events
6092162	6092983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6114321	6115162	You kill me?
6115282	6116902	Stop being such a fag.
6116962	6118243	You're being a fag.
6118283	6119944	You're a little fag right now.
6119964	6127868	And I guarantee you, in a room like that, there's going to be at least one who passed the penis check.
6128408	6137152	And the other thing, too, if you've got to complain about people killing you in a death match where the point is to kill each other, I don't understand.
6137372	6138353	Why are you killing me?
6138713	6139573	Why are you killing me?
6139673	6141214	Because that's the point of the game!
6141434	6142695	I'm calling for infiltration.
6143949	6145430	Infiltration?
6145870	6146730	Women run in?
6146990	6147651	Stampede?
6148031	6148771	Burn your bras?
6149231	6149511	No.
6150972	6152513	I'm calling for chick drag.
6153273	6154254	Chick drag?
6154854	6155614	You know it exists?
6155794	6156615	Oh yeah, oh god.
6157075	6160496	I was at the bar one night with friends with a birthday celebration.
6160516	6163397	We got there a little early and we walked right in on a drag king show.
6163457	6164638	I kid you not.
6165218	6168840	I wanted some drag kings and some nice butch lesbians to go in.
6169400	6171041	It was very butch.
6172061	6176663	Drag Queens are very sassy.
6176803	6184627	Because Drag Queens are taking the ultimate of the feminine mystique and playing it all of it up.
6184727	6186408	So that's the same thing for Drag Queens.
6186568	6190210	They take the boring dudeness and make it more boring and doodly.
6191315	6216080	Going to the chatroom at chat.orange.com Tons of comments in chat here Actdeft says they should ban the immature people instead of women Breakman says nothing ruins a good sausage fest like a woman Laha says this is why we can't have nice things Frisbee says this isn't the south, this is Texas
6218786	6221549	All right, look, to be fair, there was an update.
6221629	6223271	They did remove that paragraph.
6223311	6224192	And here's what happened.
6224793	6228357	They're saying this event is a gentleman's retreat.
6230016	6238021	We actively discourage gamers from being the kind of misogynistic jack wagon seen in the Reddit post, and such behavior should not be tolerated.
6238641	6240803	Frankly, we don't like that kind of player either.
6241183	6245986	So far as this event goes, it's a special event designed specifically for male gamers.
6246546	6254291	Further, it is meant as a getaway designed to help said male contingent become better men, both for themselves and for those who love us.
6256360	6258241	Yeah, that's more bullshit.
6259662	6260462	I gotta tell ya.
6260942	6261763	I gotta tell ya.
6262403	6263324	I've never been to Texas.
6263344	6265245	No, I was in Texas once for like five minutes.
6265265	6270607	For the few smart people in Texas, like Travis, you're not on the stupid list.
6270947	6271168	Yes.
6271428	6273129	Most everybody else is on the stupid list.
6273229	6275190	I know plenty of smart people in Texas.
6275710	6277371	And there's some that listen to this show, actually.
6278411	6285415	It's like Jeff Foxworthy says, when it comes time to talk about the South, the news always points out the least common denominator.
6286355	6286755	You know?
6287675	6288376	Here's the thing.
6288456	6293297	I got to admit, there's a part of me that's a little bit tempted since it is an all-male retreat.
6294878	6296218	It's only 49 bucks.
6296618	6299579	Maybe I should go and maybe I should flame it up a little bit.
6302460	6302900	You know what?
6303960	6305621	I heard there was a retreat!
6309043	6312225	Oh my god, we're gonna play some Battlefield?
6314306	6315827	I love Battlefield!
6318749	6321731	He just shot you in the head, what a stupid bitch.
6325373	6334058	There's a small part of me that wants to, even though I would play up to every negative stereotype I'm sure these guys already have, like, I just, you know there's that part of me that just
6335715	6337957	Now, here's my idea.
6339379	6346285	One, you either have the infiltration go on, have a woman beat all the guys' asses, and go, oh, by the way, here's my boobs.
6347346	6350109	Or, the ladies have their own counter-retreat.
6351530	6354453	Say, fine, you're not inviting us, bitches, you're not allowed.
6357995	6360176	and some interesting comments from chat here.
6360536	6363537	Black Wolf says, are they also telling black people to stay home?
6363937	6365818	No, race is not a part of this.
6365938	6368159	So they're just sexist, not racist.
6368439	6369459	They're just sexist.
6370039	6374501	I'm going to just guess with nothing to back me up, also homophobic.
6376220	6378062	And maybe a little bit racist, but I don't know.
6378502	6380903	But no, we're not seeing any apparent racism going on here.
6381584	6388688	Salacious Pop says, Loki, I feel that women who opt into participating in that first person shooter culture know what they're getting into to a point.
6389008	6396873	But neckbeards realize this and decide to escalate it until it becomes pretty disgusting and unacceptable no matter what kind of game it is and a line just gets crossed.
6397213	6400515	And you should be able to shit talk without going the gender race gay route.
6400595	6402757	It just means you're not very articulate.
6403729	6404109	Aha!
6404429	6407872	Become a smarter cut lower person.
6407892	6408292	There you go.
6409012	6412534	You just need to be smarter about your cut downs.
6413775	6426903	You know, but I mean, and I'm... And this is why I say this, and people, smart people in the South will know what I'm talking about, is that that's just, it just is like typical.
6427703	6428844	It's just typical.
6428864	6429044	Typical.
6430134	6436598	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, Devil's Advocate, there are plenty of female-only LAN events and that's empowering girl gamers.
6438360	6443583	True, but the backpedaling here a little bit is what makes it notable.
6443643	6445104	And they have the frag dolls.
6445304	6447066	It's an all-female team.
6449147	6451409	So they don't allow men in the frag dolls at all?
6451469	6453330	Like if I tried to be a frag doll, I couldn't do it?
6454827	6456669	Yeah, you go ahead and play your first person shooters.
6457229	6461753	Step into Grand Theft Auto, I'm going to own your ass.
6462113	6469579	But the whole point is just that it's really... And Breakman is asking us to stop hating on the neckbeards, please.
6469860	6474343	He has a neckbeard and he's feeling a little offended right now so that we need to stop being neckbeard-a-phobic.
6475865	6476645	Hey, ZZ Top.
6478527	6478807	Alright.
6479748	6480508	But my point is...
6482346	6486368	This is shit that I've run into all the time when I lived in Alabama.
6490649	6494151	My geek knowledge far exceeded any of the guys.
6494951	6498112	But, you know, oh, we're doing a guy party, sorry.
6499253	6499793	Fuck you!
6501394	6504275	I just kicked your ass at this game yesterday, is that why I'm not going?
6505415	6505936	No comment.

6554759	6559902	Well, as I said last week, I'm on two episodes of Pop Culture Parlay.
6560162	6561223	Ah, you did an episode arc.
6561543	6561723	Yes.
6562043	6566626	Which you can go to geek-life.com and download or go on iTunes.
6567264	6567644	There you go.
6568765	6569045	All right.
6569085	6569485	Check that out.
6569505	6570225	Pop Culture Parlay.
6570245	6574347	I did listen to a little bit of that first episode you were on while I was driving to the store or something.
6574547	6576368	And I was recently on Girls Gone Well.
6577148	6578569	So you can look back for that episode too.
6579349	6582451	The Mystery Third Podcast I'm hoping will be a reality very soon.
6582511	6588953	We've just had some we're too busy setbacks going on and knowing my week next week that's not going to get any better.
6589074	6590034	So we'll see what happens.
6590174	6591415	I'm busy Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
6591435	6591475	So
6592515	6593495	Busy, Busy Bee.
6593515	6594296	Busy, Busy Bee.
6594736	6596556	So hopefully we'll get that together.
6596616	6598017	There is a third podcast coming.
6598897	6601238	It's not going to be like a huge thing.
6601398	6603839	It will be like 30 minutes tops a week.
6604059	6605959	Breakman suggests you go as Captain Sassy Pants.
6607160	6607600	We'll see.
6609260	6611361	So yeah, that's to look forward to.
6611542	6615723	And then also, speaking of like guesting on shows and stuff, I just want to kind of throw that out there.
6615803	6622947	Like, you know, if you have a podcast or your own show, I've heard some people say like, oh, well, I would ask you to be on the show.
6623007	6627689	But my show is just this little show that's nothing serious.
6627789	6630130	And, you know, I never wanted to ask you guys because I'm too shy.
6630610	6633892	Dude, if I have the time, I will gladly come on any show.
6634092	6635933	Like, as long as your show isn't, you know...
6636653	6638595	I'd be happy to guest on any show.
6638635	6641779	The size of this show is not that large, so don't feel like you can't ever approach us.
6656039	6657380	Oh, size isn't what matters.
6657500	6658000	It's girth.
6658300	6662362	So you can email us either at mailbag at orangeauntradio.com or you can even email me directly.
6662742	6664683	I just went right past what you said.
6665043	6666303	Rob at orangeauntradio.com.
6666323	6668084	You got rid of yours because too much spam, right?
6668824	6669204	Which one?
6669425	6670025	Oh, yeah.
6670045	6670625	Orangeauntradio account.
6670685	6671325	I got way too much.
6671345	6673146	But there's ways to find her.
6673346	6675707	If you message the mailbag, I'll see it.
6675807	6677868	So it's not like... And we would be happy.
6677888	6679469	As long as we can fit it into the schedule somewhere.
6679509	6682790	Keep in mind we're on the West Coast and for a lot of... And I'm on Twitter, darksakra.com.
6683018	6684579	Oh yeah, Twitter's a great way to get a hold of us too.
6684719	6685780	That's how I still got a hold of me.
6686420	6686721	Excellent.
6687421	6687841	So there you go.
6688101	6689162	We're always happy to come.
6690103	6694006	We're approaching our 10th year of podcasting and we want it to be a big fucking deal.
6694446	6698048	So especially come next year, we're going to try and go on as many shows as we can.
6698128	6699709	So we're always happy to do that.
6700370	6701150	Anyhow, that's all I wanted to say.
6701190	6705353	Give us more stuff to plug at the top of Part B until our third podcast launches.
6705794	6708916	Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news.
6709456	6711638	Some news that we just didn't have time to cover elsewhere.
6711898	6712138	Loki.
6713068	6719634	Yes, of course there's some more details now out about the 360 port of Minecraft.
6720055	6723818	This is coming from Notch, of course the guy behind Minecraft.
6724559	6729043	And saying there's actually going to be marketing for the Xbox 360 version of Minecraft.
6729123	6734488	So I've agreed to be slightly less transparent than usual when it comes to that version.
6735168	6737871	And basically saying that there's going to be some...
6738411	6738631	DarkSakura,
6758516	6760958	That's what I'm going to do at the Gentleman's Retreat for Battlefield, by the way.
6761218	6762179	Don't shoot me!
6764241	6765041	I don't know about that.
6767243	6776410	Basically, he also said that there's, of course, the Xperia Play version of Minecraft that's going to be coming out for $7 sometime this fall.
6777111	6783716	And I guess it's programmed in a way that will make it easy to port to all sorts of mobile phones.
6784957	6785898	So that's kind of neat.
6786959	6790304	I'm sure we'll hear more details as we get closer to its release.
6790424	6791445	I'm sure it'll be pretty big.
6793708	6801899	If you just love Valve and you really want to get your hands on some Valve action figures and other stuff, well, you're going to wait until 2012.
6802019	6803662	But, toy company NECA...
6804102	6809266	They have revealed their lineup at Comic-Con, including a bunch of different franchises.
6809326	6812468	Starting with Half-Life 2, you can be able to get a Gordon Freeman action figure.
6813308	6816871	Team Fortress 2, you can get a Pyro, Heavy, and Demo action figure.
6817511	6821093	And also they have Left 4 Dead, the Boomer and Smoker action figures.
6821654	6833001	And finally, for Portal 2, Atlas and Peabody action figures, as well as a replica Portal gun and a resin and plush weighted companion cube.
6835264	6837386	Portal Gun, that's going to be pretty awesome.
6839128	6849159	I'm telling you though, NECA, if you really want to impress me, you'll do full-size turret bots.
6849439	6850080	Do they sing?
6850200	6851902	Because if that's the case, I kind of want one.
6853630	6854852	Are you still there?
6854992	6855713	Are you still there?
6870951	6871231	All right.
6871551	6872712	Can't wait for you to bring that to the show.
6872732	6873633	Are you going to bring that to episode 500?
6873813	6875434	Yeah, sure.
6875614	6875834	All right.
6876535	6880777	And then finally, Grasshopper Manufacturing is putting out a new game.
6881198	6887481	It was featured in Famitsu Magazine, and it is straight up Grasshopper.
6889443	6891504	Lollipop Chainsaw is the new game.
6891524	6893344	It's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and 360.
6893705	6902389	It is basically a game about a cheerleader raised by zombie hunters who uses her acrobatic training and chainsaw to destroy zombies.
6903209	6905010	Wasn't that a side plot in Jurassic Park 2?
6906631	6909392	Where that acrobat little girl kicked the dinosaur in the face?
6909793	6911473	Yeah, they said that was retarded.
6911533	6912454	This looks awesome.
6912494	6913174	Hey, hey, hey.
6913394	6914855	You said you're not going to use that word anymore.
6914875	6915275	Yeah, whatever.
6916016	6916116	Um...
6917657	6945796	so this should be pretty awesome and they have some screenshots up for it and she's got a chainsaw with hearts on it and she's killing zombies so it sounds to me almost a little bit like Oni Chambara just hopefully plays a lot better and of course Akira Yamaoka working on the sound nice so all good that would have made the Jurassic Park 2 a lot better if Akira Yamaoka had done the soundtrack
6946719	6949803	Did you hear there's, by the way, a confirmed Jurassic Park 4 is in development?
6950163	6951024	They want to bring that back.
6951685	6953787	I loved those movies when I was a kid, at least the first one.
6953887	6960254	I think the plot of them, you know, somehow making it to mainland and kind of spreading would be pretty awesome.
6960294	6963137	No, because that's what happened at the end of the second movie and it was terrible.
6963157	6964419	That's what made that movie so bad.
6964699	6967705	No, what made it bad is just they have a feature of the T-Rex.
6967725	6974678	I'm talking about like, you know, where it's years later where they're multiplying and coming out in small towns and stuff.
6974818	6976060	Planet of the Dinosaurs.
6976100	6976942	Yeah, track them down.
6978025	6980888	Team Fortress Arcade Team Fortress Arcade Team Fortress Arcade
7003286	7007607	For example, the Demoman can blast out sticky bombs and explode whenever he does the jumping.
7008027	7011728	Engineerings can do upgrades with the wrench and so forth.
7011968	7015809	There's actually some hands-on sessions that have been reviewed on around the internet.
7015829	7019370	There's even a little YouTube there that I guess some site did.
7019390	7020590	It's like a little review.
7021570	7023991	I think he's probably talking over this, but let me see if you get...
7024711	7025331	and DarkSakura
7043238	7047181	and also announced to Comic Con this week an R2-D2 Xbox 360.
7047262	7057530	That's right, it's an Xbox 360 bundle coming with a white Kinect and a white Xbox 360 that is kind of skinned, so to speak, to look like a R2-D2.
7058150	7061473	So it's kind of got that blue and the little vents and so forth.
7061533	7062514	I thought that was kind of neat.
7062814	7066437	It looks really cute and of course it comes with Kinect Star Wars and it's a 320 gigabyte edition.
7066457	7066737	It's a $449 bundle.
7070120	7077986	Speaking of which, Connect Star Wars and stuff, we're doing our company game something where we have publishers out and they sometimes bring demos and stuff.
7078087	7081830	I'll actually get the demo Connect Star Wars Tuesday.
7082150	7082550	Oh, nice.
7082810	7087234	Yeah, tell us what you think about that because it looks really bad, but it could be fun.
7087334	7087554	We'll see.
7087574	7090477	And I really hope THQ brings Saints Row 3 with them.
7091558	7092238	We'll see.
7092959	7093699	I really want them.
7093779	7095481	I am upset with Actdeft right now.
7095661	7095901	Why?
7096141	7098083	For mentioning Horchata and I really want some now.
7098911	7100072	Orchatas are delicious.
7100212	7100732	I know.
7101313	7103635	They have places open 24 hours that sell Orchatas.
7103995	7105656	If we can't get Pinkberry, let's get Orchatas.
7105676	7106917	You want to go get Orchata and a taco?
7107257	7107557	Yes.
7109019	7109359	All right.
7109759	7110179	I don't know.
7110239	7111340	This show's running late tonight.
7111360	7111801	All right, we'll see.
7112181	7119666	Anyhow, this news is not quite as awesome as the Orchata, but it's very, what is this going on here?
7119947	7122749	Okay, remember Mortal Kombat and the download character's Mortal Kombat.
7122809	7127072	And we knew for quite some time that there was going to be the Kenshi...
7127452	7129253	There was going to be Scarlet and Rain.
7129553	7136337	We knew those three characters for quite some time, but Warner Brothers really kept the fourth character under wraps for a long time.
7136677	7138458	Well, the fourth character was revealed this week.
7138518	7144241	The fourth download character for Mortal Kombat is going to be not Tanya, not Meat.
7144841	7146042	It's going to be Freddy Krueger.
7148584	7152086	To which a lot of people kind of went, kind of want?
7152986	7154587	Like, I think that was the reaction of most of my friends.
7154607	7156048	It was like, okay.
7156928	7157468	It's kind of cool.
7157508	7159489	I guess I can do this.
7159569	7160510	I like the fatalities.
7161050	7161290	Yeah.
7161850	7163871	No, yeah, the fatalities in the video were pretty awesome.
7163911	7165812	Like, throwing one into the incinerator or whatever.
7165832	7168274	In the furnace, because, you know, you had the boiler room.
7168674	7171855	And the first one that they showed with him pulling him down and the blood coming up.
7171995	7174096	Yeah, that was very... That was a nod back to the first movie.
7174116	7175457	That was a scene right out of the first movie, yeah.
7175477	7176017	With Johnny Depp.
7176137	7176398	Mm-hmm.
7176718	7176878	Mm-hmm.
7177538	7178739	DarkSakura.com
7208482	7222178	In other news... Well, a character that is confirmed for Arkham City is Talia al Ghul, the daughter of Ra's al Ghul, who is sometimes an anti-heroine and sometimes bad and sometimes good.
7223159	7228505	But she is going to be voiced by Stanna Kadic, who is in Castle.
7229466	7242382	So other characters that are going to be in there now is the Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Robin, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Penguin, Two-Face, Hugo Strange, Victor, Zaz, Calendar Man, and Black Mask.
7244404	7248705	And moving forward, Dance Central is getting some new songs.
7249405	7256507	It's actually getting one from Afrika Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force, Planet Rock, which is one of my favorite songs.
7257627	7262588	Tayo Cruz, Break Your Heart, and Trey Songz featuring Fabulous.
7263128	7265009	It says Fabulous.
7266309	7266829	Learn to spell.
7267429	7269390	But hey, I'm excited about the first one.
7269810	7274993	And then, last but never least, Child of Eden gets a PS3 date.
7275714	7279616	It will be on September 20th in the US and September 23rd in Europe.
7280437	7284759	And the European price is going to be about half as much for the PS3 version.
7285120	7286280	So, hey.
7288602	7288922	That's it.
7290541	7290841	Awesome.
7291641	7297983	Alright, I guess we should go to the Twitter, although I forgot to plug that at the top of the show, so I don't know if we actually got a lot of tweets tonight.
7298283	7301444	But that's okay, because we're running long tonight anyway, so I guess something's got to give at some point.
7301464	7302504	What's going on in the Twatter?
7303064	7304325	Let's go look at the Twatter right now.
7304565	7311767	Before I get to Twitter, though, can I say, there was another game I've been playing this week that I forgot to mention, and I just caught myself looking at it.
7312367	7316588	So, I have to say, on the iPhone, there's this game called Tiny Tower.
7317808	7319389	I think a lot of people are playing this.
7320169	7320590	BitBook
7344711	7359544	and you can look at what the citizens of your tower are posting on their bitbooks and let's see like for instance I forgot to restock the plant nursery for like a couple hours because I'm doing this show so one of my people wrote on bitbook came to work at the plant nursery but no one is here
7360754	7361595	It's just things like that.
7361615	7368101	But the other day, one of them wrote something like, we're going to have a party to celebrate so-and-so moving in, silly hats only.
7368181	7371144	And that really cracked me up because it was a reference to the cartoon Rejected.
7372265	7372645	Awesome.
7372946	7374327	Anyhow, yeah, that's a free game.
7374347	7379972	I've been playing the shit out of that because, you know, the tower bucks are what costs money, but you don't need them to play the game.
7380012	7381634	So that whole thing going on.
7382094	7382355	All right.
7383376	7385698	Anyhow, back to the Twitter.
7386556	7387077	Let's see.
7387237	7388438	Going to the tweets.
7389499	7390661	Getting into some twats here.
7391081	7391502	Let's see.
7392963	7396868	DJ Ranma S tweeted something that's going to come up in a little bit here on the show, I think.
7396948	7398870	Yeah, it's coming up a little later, so I can't read his tweet.
7399571	7400932	But let me go to Spazinator.
7401493	7404096	Got the ball rolling on getting my PS3 fixed yesterday.
7404156	7405497	Just waiting on the coffin now.
7406278	7407299	Non-gaming news.
7407539	7410220	As of today, gay marriage is now legal in New York State.
7410580	7412461	I think that's terrific.
7412521	7413862	I wish our state would catch up.
7413922	7418665	I'm like, it's not going to send like a gay wave across the nation.
7418745	7425848	I'm like, gay people are going to be in happy, committed stuff whether you choose to acknowledge it legally or not.
7425908	7428650	And when you don't acknowledge it legally, that's called discrimination.
7429090	7430191	I'm like, it's as simple as that.
7430611	7433252	Like, what are you going to accomplish banning gay marriage?
7434073	7434433	Nothing.
7436673	7445037	But by doing it, you are... I could get into that whole rant, but it's just like... I think Dee Snider said it best in a tweet this week.
7445077	7448058	Yes, I'm referring to Dee Snider from... What was it?
7448078	7448739	Twisted Sister?
7448759	7449199	Twisted Sister.
7449799	7450880	He said something like, it's 2011.
7452040	7454722	If you don't finally support gay marriage, then you're the problem.
7455722	7455942	Agreed.
7456823	7458703	Anyhow, that's how I feel.
7458964	7460024	If you don't agree with me, deal with it.
7461545	7461865	Let's see.
7463500	7465101	I can't remember if this is coming up later or not.
7465182	7467063	I think I can talk about this one.
7467423	7469545	If I'm repeating a story coming up, I apologize.
7469985	7472467	SJ100Matt tweeted us with a story about Bobby Kotick.
7473248	7476270	Bobby Kotick opened his mouth again to spew more trash this week.
7476370	7479533	Now he says DJ Hero was a huge mistake.
7481052	7483153	This is in an interview with Forbes Magazine.
7484054	7486996	Bobby Kotek says DJ Hero was a passion project.
7487837	7491799	We should have said, well how many people really want to unleash their inner DJ?
7492260	7502507	And then out of the people who do want to unleash their inner DJ, how many want to do it in the context of a game where you earn points versus just taking a DJ deck or tools on their Mac and actually being a DJ?
7502827	7504829	And it turns out it's a very small market.
7506029	7513851	And Bobby Kotick said that seeing DJ Hero fail despite critical acclaim in the marketing plan that pushed it down their throats was one of the hardest failures for him.
7515111	7515791	So there you go.
7515911	7518932	And he also talks about Guitar Hero and so on.
7519232	7526254	Quote, it was very clear people didn't want more 80s heavy metal music, but what they wanted was very difficult for us to get from the music companies.
7527394	7530657	The number one thing that our audiences wanted in Guitar Hero was Led Zeppelin.
7530897	7533499	But we couldn't get Led Zeppelin to consent to give us the rights.
7534339	7534800	Interesting.
7534880	7538462	So kind of blaming the failure of Guitar Hero on the music industry.
7538763	7541485	And maybe there's only so many songs that people want to play.
7542105	7543526	Especially when you look at rock band.
7544106	7545988	Shit, rock band has almost everything now.
7546548	7547029	Seems like.
7547269	7548309	And I'm always wanting more.
7548670	7548890	Yeah.
7550051	7550251	So.
7551472	7551752	All right.
7553709	7554750	Moving on to other tweets.
7555391	7562361	Zether77 tweets us saying, According to a YouTube video, OpaOpa is a hidden character in Planet Harriers.
7563042	7565586	Yes, but OpaOpa also makes appearances in levels.
7566387	7566948	Ah, I see.
7567572	7570534	and somebody else I'm guessing is on his friends list.
7571215	7571615	What is this?
7571755	7577579	Kijikage responded to him and said, I've been wanting that for years, like since GameCube came out.
7577859	7580000	So you're not alone in your Planet Harrier love.
7580421	7583783	Planet Harriers is like... It did look pretty awesome.
7583863	7585524	It did look pretty awesome from the video you showed me.
7585544	7586745	I kind of wish I'd played that.
7586865	7589527	I had no idea that it was at Great America.
7589547	7590868	I just somehow overlooked that.
7591609	7593592	Anyhow, TigerClaw sends us a couple tweets.
7593673	7595196	One of them's about Majora's Mask.
7595717	7597019	That's right, on the 3DS.
7597179	7597600	Why not?
7597660	7600566	Because, you know, we had Zelda Ocarina of Time on the 3DS.
7600987	7603251	Why not Majora's Mask?
7604142	7604302	E.G.
7604523	7606124	Anoma, who is one of the folks behind Zelda
7624338	7627340	I guess they're saying that if fans demanded it, they would make it.
7628401	7633987	Oh, so that you'll do, but oh, the people wanting you to port a simple game that's already been localized.
7634727	7636349	Nah, you'll take a shit on them.
7637370	7637530	Yep.
7638951	7643876	Although, I don't know, I still think, Loki, there's going to be a press conference where it says the fans demanded it.
7643936	7647880	Of course they're going to, and they're going to come out looking like the heroes.
7647900	7648981	Look at those abs, dude.
7650703	7651263	Oh, on Poison?
7651283	7651583	Poison.
7652184	7652424	All right.
7652744	7656486	Look, last tweet here from Tigerclaw about Wesley Snipes.
7656946	7658827	He has made a video game from prison.
7659587	7660428	Absolutely right.
7660928	7663489	This is Julius Stiles the International.
7663569	7667311	It's a video game that Wesley Snipes... Not to be confused with Julius Stiles.
7667351	7667771	That's right.
7668172	7672274	Wesley Snipes, by the way, most famous for his role in Too Wong Fu, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar.
7672834	7673834	Does not look good in drag.
7675115	7677557	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
7696407	7702169	I guess the game is only coming out on iPad and iPhone because those are probably the easiest platforms to publish on.
7702589	7703589	And we like criminals.
7704049	7705229	There you go, Julia Stiles.
7705269	7709330	If you want to support Wesley Snipes and help fund his legal fund, you can check out this game.
7711911	7714852	That's it for the Twitter tonight at twitter.com slash OLR.
7715312	7717652	Hey, we're just about to tonight's list list.
7717692	7718433	I'm so excited.
7718473	7721233	We haven't done one of these in forever and I thought it's high time we do another game.
7721553	7723714	But first, another bout of news for you.
7725090	7725551	Ah, yes.
7726051	7730076	Um, you know, it's like every other week we have a lawsuit against Zynga.
7730516	7734561	Or, you know, even one week we had Zynga suing someone else.
7735061	7738545	But no, this week it's actually a lawsuit against Zynga over Farmville, of course.
7739186	7740227	Uh, the source code.
7740247	7745413	Apparently, a California-based web developer named, um, Social Apps...
7746614	7758400	They decided to sue Zynga because of alleged copyright infringement, violation of trade secrets, breach of written contract, breach of implied in fact contract, and breach of confidence.
7759801	7773588	Their argument is that they entered into agreement with Zynga, whereas Zynga would receive access to their source code for the social apps Facebook game MyFarm in exchange for some form of compensation.
7774748	7780651	According to the suit, Zynga was given the code, at which point they fled into the night, never to be heard from again.
7781291	7788334	Social Apps claims that MyFarm's source code provided the foundation for FarmVille, as well as its many derivatives.
7789114	7799018	They're seeking permanent injunction, damages, attorney's fees, as well as any of Zynga's profits or gains which can be attributed to FarmVille.
7800111	7801293	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7815091	7818695	and then Zynga would give them money that they never got.
7819056	7820618	Is that what essentially this is about?
7821238	7822340	Am I hearing this right?
7822920	7829408	I guess, but I don't know why if you would let someone look at your source code and expect them not to steal it.
7829508	7830069	You know what I mean?
7830089	7830570	I mean...
7831252	7832572	or use it in some way, I guess.
7832673	7833113	Exactly.
7833253	7835313	Why would you want to do that?
7835333	7836034	What would be the point?
7836134	7839095	Well, maybe Zynga had the idea on how to get it out there.
7839115	7842416	I mean, Zynga, before they put out Farmville, weren't they already huge for Mafia Wars?
7843256	7843656	I don't know.
7844196	7844597	Don't care.
7845457	7852399	So I could see where maybe you're going to take somebody else's game and make it better and market it a little better and then make tons of money off of it.
7852439	7854360	But yeah, you would owe them a piece of the profits.
7854820	7856280	But of course, we're only hearing one side of this.
7856501	7858101	Have we had an official response from Zynga yet?
7858221	7858821	I guess not, huh?
7860522	7860682	Nope.
7861377	7861517	Zynga
7871822	7873083	Xbox.com.
7874683	7879765	We heard about this happening before, that games would soon be a part of Xbox.com.
7880146	7890190	But now, I guess with games for Windows now combining with Xbox.com, there are four free trial games that you can play on the Xbox 360 homepage.
7890510	7894171	You can play them right in your browser, and you don't have to install them to your computer or anything.
7894511	7895712	Now the games that you can play...
7896232	7908143	Plants vs. Zombies, Bejeweled 3, Zuma's Revenge, and Text Twist 2 Which are all pretty much PopCap games Or they're stuff that sound right off of... What is it?
7908223	7917732	The Zone, MSN Zone has been around forever And it had all those games too And it's kind of weird that Microsoft hasn't brought that into the fold If they haven't already Does that still exist?
7918593	7920975	I remember I had an account there like forever ago
7921836	7923738	Yeah, ZoneMSN.com still exists.
7923758	7925459	I'm really surprised this isn't in the fold, too.
7925899	7928721	I mean, these are like as casual as they get games, though.
7929802	7932304	This is where you can play such winners as Bubbles!
7932804	7933945	You can play them in your sleep.
7934165	7934906	That's casual.
7935106	7935927	Patchworks!
7937227	7938989	And Fishdom's Spooky Splash!
7941212	7941532	DarkSakura
7963775	7970180	Well, how about something that... I had to make sure that it wasn't a joke when I first saw it.
7971521	7974183	Capcom is announcing Street Fighter vs. Hello Kitty.
7975204	7976004	I'm not joking.
7976525	7977005	Wait, what?
7977305	7981749	Fall 2012, Street Fighter and Hello Kitty will have a single game together.
7981849	7985331	So I could, like, play as Bats Maru and, like, kick E. Honda's ass?
7985692	7986172	I guess.
7986672	7991536	But they put up a picture of Kitty dressed up as Chun-Li.
7993044	7994885	It was like just a flash on the screen.
7996006	8000208	And there's nothing else, you know, really about it.
8000288	8006011	But the quote says that... This is from Joshua Izzo, who's the director of licensing with Capcom.
8006531	8011153	Capcom has long admired Sanrio and their ability to create memorable and cherished lifestyle brands.
8011533	8015495	So it is a distinct pleasure to partner with them for this new crossover line of merchandise.
8016056	8017817	So it looks like it's just merchandise, really.
8017897	8018097	Yeah.
8018797	8020878	Yeah, it's just like handbags and wallets.
8020978	8023939	Could you imagine them doing Pocket Fighter with Sanrio characters?
8024579	8025159	That would be weird.
8025179	8026659	It would be kind of weird, but funny.
8029000	8029660	That's kind of cute.
8031061	8031481	I don't know.
8031501	8035222	There's a part of me, when I first heard this story, I was like, no way are they making a game.
8035242	8038383	And then I heard it was the merchandising, and I'm like, that is really weird.
8038403	8042804	And I see the picture of Hello Kitty as Chun-Li, and I'm like, what in the actual fuck is this?
8043044	8044645	And why do I still really want it?
8044925	8047366	I want a Batsmaru done up as Golki.
8048197	8050479	I think Batsamaru would probably get the Ryu treatment.
8050619	8051700	I think that's what I'm going to see.
8051861	8052681	No, Dear Daniel would.
8053182	8053542	You think?
8053662	8053942	I think.
8054483	8054883	We'll see.
8055884	8057366	But I love this Chun-Li kitty.
8057426	8058166	It's so adorable.
8058727	8059267	I want that.
8060248	8060529	All right.
8062030	8064152	Anyhow, let's get to Listless.
8064873	8065573	I'm so excited.
8065613	8068876	We haven't done a game here on OLR in a long time, so let's do Listless.
8068916	8069317	Listless.
8072213	8076935	Tonight, we are going to create the definitive list on a particular topic in gaming.
8077536	8079357	And here's the way that Listless works.
8079437	8088401	We're gonna all go around in studio, and I'm gonna bring on a guest on the phone here in a moment, and we're each gonna bring up our list of three possible choices to put on the list.
8088421	8089322	But then the difficult part,
8089642	8092404	We all go around and eliminate one from the list.
8092424	8096327	That will leave us with a list of eight possible answers for the topic.
8097047	8100910	And then you guys in the chat room will get to vote on your number one and number two picks.
8101290	8106614	So our list combined with your votes create the definitive list for this topic.
8106634	8107334	And there's no argument.
8107354	8109115	This is a highly scientific process.
8109416	8110436	There's no arguing.
8110717	8111917	This is what the fans want.
8112518	8112798	All right.
8113198	8115280	So I bet you are dying to know tonight's topic.
8116055	8116956	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8134116	8137037	is adding characters, so what characters should be next?
8137077	8139998	Let me bring on a fourth panelist tonight.
8140358	8151281	Now, I have to admit, I was trying to get Extifer tonight because it would have been fun, and I know he plays the Mortal Kombat series, but unfortunately he had to bow out, so he's not going to be able to be on the show tonight.
8151301	8152902	He was getting his asshole bleached.
8154802	8156343	Exactly, exactly right.
8156403	8157944	So he couldn't join us.
8158245	8163468	But I got a substitute that tends to substitute for Extifer over on Horde House as well when needed.
8163948	8166450	So here we go.
8166490	8167471	I'm going to give him a call right now.
8170940	8171761	One ringy dingy.
8171801	8172901	Hopefully it rings.
8173022	8173322	I don't know.
8173342	8173922	Two ringy dingy.
8173942	8174322	There we go.
8174362	8174683	Hello.
8175143	8175423	Hello.
8175563	8176484	Hey, Salacious Pop.
8177024	8177545	Hey, what's up?
8177625	8178305	Hey, not much.
8178525	8179586	Welcome to Orange Laundry.
8179626	8180687	Or welcome back, rather.
8181547	8187711	And thanks for... Thinking how since I've moved up in here with you, I'm sort of on the show less than when I was when I lived in the Bay.
8187911	8188792	I know.
8188852	8189412	But here you are.
8189452	8190273	You're back again tonight.
8190353	8191854	You're welcome to come over whenever you want.
8191914	8195717	Filling in for Extover, sort of, who is who I was trying to get for this segment tonight.
8195757	8197758	But just like on Horde House, you are saving the day.
8199008	8199728	So I appreciate it.
8200089	8207332	Now, usually we have guests on here to plug websites or their own podcasts.
8207692	8208993	Is there anything you want to plug tonight?
8211594	8218457	I was also the guest commentator on the most recent episode of Horde House for WoW discussion, if anyone cares about that.
8218538	8219538	But otherwise, not really.
8219958	8221579	No, I hate WoW and I hate Horde House.
8221619	8222299	It's a bad show.
8224640	8227182	You should probably stop producing it because you're one of the co-hosts.
8228325	8231107	All right, let's get to tonight's list.
8232168	8238994	All right, so you've already been briefed on the topic at hand, so everybody here in studio and on the phone should have their top three answers.
8239375	8243979	Now that Mortal Kombat is clearly adding whatever character they want, what character should be next?
8244319	8255109	Now, we're also relying on those of you in chat to give your answers, because if one of us has an item get duplicated on the list or something where we don't want to say the same thing twice, we often turn to chat.
8255549	8257991	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8279156	8282837	Weren't there always rumors of an Ash vs. Freddy vs. Jason movie?
8283077	8284238	There was, yeah.
8284318	8290119	And actually they did a comic of Army of Darkness vs. Marvel Zombies.
8290579	8291200	And he was in it.
8291620	8292020	Interesting.
8292240	8292500	Yeah.
8292620	8297321	So not out of the entire realm of possibility of Ash being in a fighting game.
8297342	8298682	And you know Bruce Campbell likes money.
8299182	8300003	Yeah, of course, of course.
8300443	8301804	All right, I'll go next.
8302264	8308167	I'm going to say my number three answer is Barney the Purple Dinosaur is my number three answer.
8308187	8308727	That's awesome.
8308827	8311709	Who doesn't want to perform a fatality on Barney?
8312416	8313436	I love you.
8313896	8315057	You love me.
8315537	8319498	Let's go and beat up Barney with a baseball bat.
8319558	8320898	We'll knock him to the floor.
8321338	8323539	No more purple dinosaur.
8324099	8324519	There you go.
8324559	8326500	I'll never sing again on this program, ladies and gentlemen.
8326960	8328240	Barney the Purple Dinosaur.
8329501	8330661	Is he even on TV anymore?
8333081	8335764	I think so, yeah.
8335884	8337485	Are you a big fan of Barney slash Pop?
8338987	8348235	I have two half-brothers that are significantly younger than me, and they were toddlers during the early and mid-90s, which was when Barney the Dinosaur ruled the fucking world.
8348676	8354921	So yeah, my 16-year-old ass had to sit at home and watch those VHS tapes 20, 30 times in a day.
8355142	8357604	So how do you feel about Barney in Mortal Kombat?
8358001	8359182	There's some trauma there.
8359543	8368353	I think I could get out my PTSD, my post-traumatic stress disorder, by killing him in Mortal Kombat from my teenage years.
8368453	8369554	I would be a fan of that.
8369935	8370616	Alright, awesome.
8371076	8373199	Alright, Loki, we'll go to you next.
8373219	8374180	What's your number three answer?
8374981	8377584	My number three answer, Colonel Sanders.
8382051	8383732	Why the Man from KFC?
8383752	8385253	Because it would be hilarious.
8385513	8387194	It reminds me of Project Aco.
8387954	8389415	It's the Colonel!
8391076	8391676	I love it.
8391956	8393157	Yeah, it just would be fun.
8393317	8397759	Alright, Salacious Pop, your number three answer.
8398700	8405923	This might be a little bit obscure, but for those who remember the Spawn comics, Spawn from the 90s, Angela.
8407344	8408305	Angela from Spawn.
8408325	8408805	Oh, okay.
8411469	8414871	She's got the TNA and she's got the brutality, so I think she'd be a great fit.
8431644	8438027	Spawn was a demon from hell after this alien sort of usurped Lucifer from hell.
8438307	8439868	So Spawn was a demon.
8440368	8444811	Angela was this badass angel from heaven, except she would just fucking kill you.
8444891	8446071	She was brutal.
8446111	8451414	It wasn't a very feathers and wings and pretty choir angels with halos.
8451654	8455196	She was really a force to be reckoned with.
8455336	8458077	So I definitely think she could kick some ass in Mortal Kombat.
8458277	8458577	Pyramid Head
8475748	8477249	Pyramid Head from Silent Hill.
8477569	8478590	Need I ask why?
8479271	8479971	No, you don't need to.
8482053	8484014	I could ask, but then I might end up dead, right?
8485035	8485816	He's badass.
8485936	8487577	And that's actually a serious suggestion.
8487857	8489779	That's a good answer.
8489819	8491340	Pyramid Head is on the list there.
8491380	8492181	I saw that in chat.
8492501	8498085	and I actually, when I saw it go by in chat, Zether in chat suggested when I saw that, I was like, ooh, I'm taking that one if one of mine gets stolen.
8498526	8507432	But since now it's already on the list, I'll use my original number two answer, which I'm sorry, this would be badass and this should absolutely be in Mortal Kombat.
8508033	8516799	And who is a character, I'm gonna ask this question, who is a character more scary than Freddy Krueger and Jason combined?
8517060	8520002	Who is the scariest fucking character ever in the history of ever?
8520282	8521103	My mother pissed off?
8521863	8522123	No.
8522584	8523805	Pennywise the Clown.
8523925	8524905	Oh my god!
8526286	8527667	And that's my number two answer.
8527727	8528868	Pennywise the Clown.
8529188	8531770	I am afraid of clowns and I really hate that clown.
8532070	8533171	So don't you want to kill one?
8534312	8540456	Well, Shang Tsung turned into... Well, you know Shang Tsung's clown fatality was supposed to be Joker's fatality.
8541037	8541417	Oh, wow.
8541657	8544840	In the DC vs. Mortal Kombat.
8544860	8545560	I didn't know that.
8545580	8545640	But...
8548362	8548963	Thanks for watching!
8568525	8570086	Loki, what's your number two answer?
8570226	8578852	My number two answer is the most frightening thing beyond Pennywise is a cloud that is just hit media altogether.
8579332	8580473	And that would be Lady Gaga.
8583795	8588756	If anyone deserves to be torn apart as strange as fucking hell, it's Lady Gaga.
8589337	8594718	You could do some Ermac and some Noob Saibot fucking crazy morphing shit with those costumes of hers.
8594778	8595198	You could.
8595238	8596619	It would be costume morphing.
8596939	8601500	Her costumes would be like those bubble dresses would be filled with acid and shit.
8601600	8603901	I would play as Lady Gaga and I would beat your ass.
8605345	8607588	I would shove a 9-inch stiletto in your character's eye.
8607608	8609770	For the record, Becky said she jumped when you said Pennywise.
8612213	8614456	I'm telling you, Pennywise is a scary motherfucker.
8614816	8615958	Alright, there you go.
8616078	8616879	Lady Gaga.
8616959	8617520	Oh, I love this.
8617580	8621605	DDR Dollar Bill in chat suggests Pennywise turns into a giant spider for a fatality.
8621745	8621805	Ah!
8622425	8623345	God, I'm scared.
8623765	8626366	All right.
8626386	8627547	Salacious Pop, it's over to you.
8627587	8628807	What's your number two answer?
8629367	8635089	So the key question to this list list is characters and not people.
8635329	8638650	So I'm saying Rose motherfucking Nyland from the Golden Girls.
8639770	8640470	Betty White.
8642291	8642931	Rose Nyland.
8643491	8643831	Bring it.
8644111	8644991	Rose Nyland.
8645011	8645712	She'll kill you.
8650009	8651991	And what would Rose Nyland's fatality be?
8652032	8653213	Would it be a story from St.
8653293	8653513	Olaf?
8654154	8655335	Yes, she'd tell a St.
8655396	8657959	Olaf story and you would take a shotgun and you would kill yourself.
8661694	8666159	I always wanted my Golden Girls game that was Grandma Got Guns.
8666399	8670864	And it was about the Golden Girls just going on a rampage to save their retirement home or whatever.
8670944	8675129	Alright, so Rose Nyland is Salacious Pop's number two answer.
8675189	8675890	Alright, here it is.
8676170	8678112	Time for the number one answers.
8678392	8679433	We're going to go around and get them.
8680739	8689603	Ash from Evil Dead, Barney the Purple Dinosaur, Colonel Sanders, Angela from Spawn, Pyramid Head, Pennywise the Clown from It, Lady Gaga, and Rose Nyland.
8701906	8705170	You gotta spell that last name for me.
8706151	8707953	P-I-Z-Z-I-N-I.
8709254	8710736	Okay, P-I-Z-Z-I-N-I.
8711076	8712117	I don't know this character either.
8712157	8713279	You gotta explain this to me a little bit.
8713419	8714380	Keep in mind I don't read comics.
8714400	8719626	Witchblade, basically, it's like this gauntlet that's stuck on one hand, but it will turn into any weapons and be armor.
8719686	8721348	So she's wearing this big metal ball.
8722549	8724771	But other than that, you know...
8749468	8773007	I think that I just always liked the character so she'd be badass alright I'm gonna get to my number one answer my number one answer is also a very serious answer like I really think and Salacious Pop might be mad at me because I have a feeling this could be who he's thinking too so I apologize in advance if this is your answer Salacious Pop but I have to say a character I would honestly love to see in Mortal Kombat that would kick a lot of ass would be Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill hell yeah
8775390	8776951	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8797461	8797881	Thanks for watching!
8821523	8822604	Loki, your number one answer.
8823145	8830951	My number one answer, unfortunately, he has passed, but Billy Mays.
8833894	8834554	Billy Mays.
8834774	8835615	Hi, guys.
8836296	8837217	Billy Mays here.
8837937	8842081	Would he actually show off something in his infomercial before killing you with it?
8842101	8843422	He would throw OxyClean on you.
8843502	8845664	You would die.
8845904	8849527	He would spray you with OxyClean and then start scrubbing away until your face came off.
8849767	8849947	Mr. Rogers
8868067	8869208	Mr. Rogers.
8869268	8871950	Are you inspired by the ultimate battle of ultimate destiny?
8872130	8873812	From Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.
8873912	8874893	Was that a yes?
8875313	8877395	Yeah.
8877655	8878115	I knew it.
8878756	8880297	So why Mr. Rogers?
8882419	8883539	No one is that nice.
8883980	8885121	You've got to have a dark side.
8885401	8887763	He actually was really that nice in person.
8889813	8899138	Yeah, like, seriously, you know those a-holes at that particular church in Kansas, I don't want to name them on the show, but we all know who they are, right?
8899158	8901359	They're the guys that protest at funerals and all that stuff, right?
8901959	8909063	And, you know, actually, a lot of that stuff, it pissed me off, but I didn't get really pissed off until they were going to protest Mr. Rogers' funeral.
8909403	8913685	And I was like, you don't fucking, like, Mr. Rogers will fuck you up.
8914005	8914245	Like...
8915806	8916667	Hit kill with kindness.
8916687	8922330	He will sick King Friday and Madam What's-Her-Name and all those people on your ass.
8922370	8925232	He will tie you to that carousel and spin you around until you throw up.
8925633	8926373	That's what will happen.
8926393	8927234	Hit kill with kindness.
8927274	8927794	That's right.
8929015	8929475	There you go.
8929575	8932597	Mr. Rogers, an Actdeft in chat says, in a bloodstained sweater.
8932977	8933938	All right.
8934038	8936720	Rob, you've heard the ultimate battle of ultimate destiny, haven't you?
8936780	8937160	I haven't.
8938721	8954516	You need to play it during the break There is no more break, we're in part B The break before the thing Here we go, here's the list of 12 Ash from Evil Dead, Barney the Purple Dinosaur Colonel Sanders, Angela from Spawn Pyramid Head
8954876	8966564	Pennywise the Clown from IT, Lady Gaga, Rose Nyland who was Betty White in the Golden Girls, Sarah Pizzini from Witchblade, Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill, Billy Mays, and Mr. Rogers.

8968145	8970587	Some serious, some very much not.
8970727	8972528	I almost said Snuffleupagus.
8974509	8975269	Oh, Bird.
8975329	8976950	Yeah, some of the answers that missed my list.
8977170	8979411	Kenny from South Park, and I was just going to say Chun-Li.
8980051	8982212	But let me read some of the answers from chat.
8982892	8985053	I had Undead Michael Jackson on my list originally.
8986774	8987494	Oh, nice, nice.
8987514	8988674	I almost thought about Voldemort.
8988714	8990635	I'm surprised no one said Amy Winehouse.
8990695	8994356	Actually, I changed Amy Winehouse to Michael Jackson.
8994677	8995917	Oh, there you go.
8995977	8998118	Tigerclaw said, how about Justin Bieber?
8998798	8999218	There you go.
8999538	9001299	Wyland says, Sam from Trick or Treat.
9002260	9003921	Actdeft says, how about Bobby Kotek?

9010344	9011564	Giant Enemy Crab.
9012284	9014866	SJ100Matt says, American McGee's Alice.
9014886	9016626	I don't know if he was responding to another question.
9016647	9018027	Zether said, Panty and Stocking.
9020788	9021389	Let's see.
9021409	9023330	I'm trying to look quickly through.
9025402	9027905	Elmer Fudd, Seriously, says Legend of Zaku.
9028786	9031069	Tiger Claw says, how about the Queen Alien from Aliens?
9032951	9034393	There's a few people saying Pikachu.
9034453	9035574	Laha says Pikachu.
9036916	9037737	Pikachu.
9037757	9040180	So they go, oh, and Giovedeo says Ronald McDonald.
9040541	9040961	There you go.
9041281	9041582	All right.
9042363	9042643	So...
9044617	9046438	DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
9073587	9078369	I would have to say Barney because I find him even more traumatic than anything else in the universe.
9079049	9083150	And just, I wouldn't be able to fight him because I would have to pause the game and go throw up.
9083350	9086191	Alright, Barney the purple dinosaur has been stricken from the list.
9086952	9091994	I am going to remove, I'm sorry, I do think this is a great idea, but it's just a little too crazy.
9092054	9093434	I'm taking Billy Mays off the list.
9093814	9096455	Billy Mays is not worthy of the list, so it has been stricken from the list.
9096975	9098616	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
9099515	9106004	Um, unfortunately, it's not the golden girl I would have picked, so, uh, Rose Nyland has to be removed up the list.
9106024	9107406	B. Arthur was a close second.
9107426	9110230	B. Arthur is a badass bitch.
9110290	9113715	You should have just went with Maude, and then there's Maude.
9115537	9116798	I have to share this with you.
9117158	9118799	Do you ever watch the Deadpool PSAs?
9119639	9119820	No.
9120000	9122801	Well, Deadpool had a minor obsession with Bea Arthur.
9122861	9124022	Okay, a major obsession with Bea Arthur.
9124042	9124662	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
9124722	9128504	And it had a poster in the thing that said, Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like Bea?
9129425	9130025	Yes, yes.
9131026	9131366	All right.
9131786	9134067	So, Rose Nyland has been stricken from the list.
9134227	9136569	So, nine items remain.
9136589	9137949	Salacious Pop, it comes down to you.
9138049	9140030	One of these must come off the list for us to proceed.
9140070	9141992	Which of these is not worthy of the list, Salacious Pop?
9143352	9149115	Pennywise the Clown However, wouldn't it have been cool to actually get Tim Curry to voice him?
9163240	9164640	I know, right?
9164960	9167321	Or just have Tim Curry be... I'm so angry.
9167361	9169101	Tim Curry should be... Frank should be in it.
9169701	9171442	Frank and Carter should be in it instead.
9171842	9172982	I'm so angry.
9173822	9174843	No Nookie for a week.
9174983	9175323	Alright.
9176443	9176863	Sorry.
9177423	9180924	Tiger Claw says how awesome it would be if Ash was in Mortal Kombat.
9181304	9184905	His little intro animation would be him showing up and saying, Okay, she-bitch, let's go.
9185865	9186806	Alright, here it is.
9186986	9188828	Here are the eight items you can vote on tonight.
9189128	9201198	Ash from Evil Dead, Colonel Sanders, Angela from Spawn, Pyramid Head, Lady Gaga, Sarah Pizzini from Witchblade, Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill, and Mr. Rogers.
9201258	9202820	Those are the items left on the list.
9203140	9206583	Slash pop, there is a death mob going on in chat.
9208700	9209661	This always happens, though.
9209681	9210702	This is just a part of this list.
9211263	9213264	A popular answer always gets taken off the list.
9213284	9214185	Hey, no kicking allowed.
9214486	9214746	Always.
9216167	9217068	You're not allowed to kick him.
9217108	9218329	Don't kick him from chat.
9218690	9219711	That is hilarious.
9219811	9220371	I don't mind.
9220451	9221032	Hold on a minute.
9221052	9221693	No, no.
9222013	9224355	Ranma needs to remember who the queen bee is here in chat.
9225696	9227097	Alright, anyhow.
9228157	9229498	Alright, there we go.
9229698	9230178	So there it is.
9230258	9232359	I'm going to post that list in our chat room right now.

9264918	9265939	Yes?
9266519	9268520	Are you reading what the chatroom is saying now?
9268861	9269361	Yeah.
9269461	9270622	Are you regretting your decision?
9271078	9274140	I'm being egged on to retaliate by someone and I won't say who.
9274200	9279304	And I will respect the fact that I have ops temporarily and I will not do it.
9279644	9280225	So sorry.
9280845	9281185	All right.
9281265	9285108	Plus, you don't want to have a no getting laid warranty for two weeks.
9286509	9287430	Yeah, that's true.
9287530	9287770	All right.
9288211	9296716	All right, SlicesPop, thank you once again for filling in tonight, and we appreciate you had some great answers tonight, despite the elimination controversy.
9297337	9299758	Quickly, anything you want to plug, like your Twitter or anything like that?
9299778	9302240	I don't know if you do writing online or whatever that you want to plug.
9302740	9305162	I just want to say that don't worry, you'll float.
9305242	9306403	We all float down here.
9308164	9309324	All right, there you go.
9310105	9311426	Thanks, SlicesPop.
9312206	9312426	Bye.
9312647	9312907	Bye.
9315333	9319595	Alright, while those votes come in, let's get back into some other gaming news.
9319655	9324096	And we're going to go over to Loki with some news about GameCube games.
9324276	9338702	Yes, apparently Nintendo Director of Entertainment and Trend Marketing, Amber McCollum, was quoted during an interview with Nintendo Gal on the subject of GameCube games not being playable on the upcoming Wii U.
9339582	9349246	McCollum said, GameCube disc will not be compatible with the Wii U, but a number of games that were playable on the GameCube can be downloaded from WiiWare.
9350347	9351407	And people were like, really?
9351427	9353728	Is that going to be possible?
9353748	9358770	Are you going to be able to download games via some sort of storage device or something like that?
9359510	9383904	of course when asked to clarify that statement they went and said to clarify the capabilities of the Wii U system as correctly stated the Wii U will not be able to play Nintendo GameCube disc however Nintendo has not made any announcement regarding download content so they kind of backstepped a little bit but sounds like that maybe that's something that they're going to be working towards is having GameCube games downloadable
9387062	9388343	Do you think that will really happen?
9388463	9391365	Because it would seem to me like the GameCube games are kind of large.
9391425	9393546	But then again, we have Xbox 360 games and stuff like that.
9394006	9396188	I'm not sure if they would do that.
9396348	9403392	I think if anything, they would just re-release GameCube games or touch them up somewhat and re-release them on it.
9403412	9407315	Like they were doing the new Play Control stuff where it was on a Wii disc but it was a GameCube game.
9407415	9408936	I could see more of that happening.
9409256	9409876	Right, right.
9409996	9412378	Because it gives them an excuse to charge more money and...
9412899	9416206	I would gladly pay for F-Zero GX all over again though to be honest.
9416266	9417028	I'm not even going to lie.
9417609	9418150	Take my money.
9418591	9420475	I would gladly pay you tomorrow for a hamburger today.
9421403	9426907	You be quiet Alright, moving on to a story about Iram Do you know the company Iram?
9426927	9427648	Have you ever heard of Iram?
9427668	9445482	Freakin' R-Type That's right, they made R-Type They made a lot of other interesting games too But here's the deal R-Type, there's a few of these games on the PSP Like there's R-Type's Tactics on the PSP R-Type Tactics 2 There's also the game archives have R-Types and R-Types Delta These are all over the PlayStation Network and PlayStation Go
9445862	9446522	Well, guess what?
9446783	9449364	Come August 11th, these games are going away.
9449924	9452886	Irem is taking their catalog off of the PlayStation Network.
9453366	9456908	And same thing goes for their specific PlayStation Home lounges.
9457608	9460970	They had some, I guess, nine lounges that were about these games.
9461450	9462931	They are all going away.
9464431	9468274	I guess the Doki Doki Suikoden Lounge is the only one that's staying.
9468575	9468955	I don't know.
9469736	9475840	So yeah, Irem has not said why they're going away, but these games on PSP are no longer going to be available.
9475900	9477261	Now a lot of these I've never heard of.
9477602	9485988	There's games like, these are all very Japanese titles, Mosukesu based on Cartoon Con, Bumpy Trot Beagle Battle Tournament.
9486208	9488890	These are all games that are downloadable right now on PlayStation Network.
9488910	9490632	They are going to be going away on August 11th.
9491332	9496755	I wonder if this is some type of retaliation, so to speak, for the PSN being down for so long.
9497916	9498276	I don't know.
9498436	9502579	Nah, it's probably just licensing coming up and they decided not to renew it or something.
9503519	9503899	Gotcha.
9505120	9505980	Alright, well there you go.
9506061	9508882	They are coming off of PlayStation Network, so enjoy them while you can.
9508982	9512604	Not like I can't bust out the master system and play our type.
9512664	9513665	The original system, right?
9514525	9515785	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
9516486	9525607	Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and pulls out some of her favorite emails to read right now.
9525908	9529388	By the way, this is also the last call for votes in tonight's list list.
9529428	9531529	Get them in now or they will not count.
9531889	9535349	To send a private message, type slash MSG Sky, vote one and vote two.
9535670	9536070	There you go.
9536130	9536930	Give Rob your sodium.
9537570	9537710	Yes.
9538803	9539683	Greetings, OLR!
9539823	9542664	Thanks for helping my commute to work a more pleasant one with your podcast.
9543465	9547006	I really find this debate of online passes and used games quite interesting.
9547126	9552648	A long-time gamer like yourselves, I am actually quite indifferent about this tactic.
9553028	9557990	I do buy most of my games new, like Rob, though I do dabble in the occasional used title here and there as well.
9558430	9567433	While I am not foolish enough to believe that every used game equals a lost new game sale, it would be equally foolish to assume that new game sales aren't somewhat hurt by the used game market.
9567853	9568213	DarkSakura.com
9596841	9599502	I know that this slippery slope argument exists.
9600103	9607646	At the same time, I give consumers more credit than Loki may that they can look at each issue on a case-by-case basis and reject ideas that they feel cross the line.
9608267	9616731	I've often wondered if there could be a moratorium on used game sales placed for maybe three or six months so that new games aren't hindered by used game sales.
9617211	9623454	At the end of the day, both used games and new games have their place for now, and I can't begrudge anyone for choosing what solution works for them.
9623874	9625315	Thanks to all of you, Dark Charger.
9626215	9631317	PS, if the show is interested in a new copy of Adobe Lightroom 3, yes.
9632817	9634698	Jamie is, yes.
9635558	9637699	Email me and I will send it to you as a gift.
9638239	9639560	Thanks again for the podcast.
9639660	9641160	I wish that I could listen live more often.
9642221	9642501	Yes.
9644186	9644547	Saved.
9647649	9656254	I think the idea is interesting about the whole moratorium, but I just don't think it's possible because you'd be telling people they can't sell their own new product.
9656314	9660136	Like, what's to stop me from going to my neighbor saying, oh, yeah, you want this game?
9660156	9660837	I don't really play it.
9660877	9661898	Here, give me 40 bucks.
9661978	9670263	It would never happen because you're basically telling people that when they're done with their game that they can't trade it back into... I mean, okay, let's say that they're able to sell it back to GameStop, but GameStop's not going to sell it.
9670663	9671163	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9693608	9706234	If you basically ban used game sales or make it not very pretty to the fact that it devalues the used game, then they're not going to have money to buy that new game that you want them to buy.
9706334	9709115	So you see, you're in turn hurting yourself.
9709876	9720781	But they won't figure that out until everyone jumps on board with this type of scheme and then it affects them down the line and they're like, ah, crap, why did we do that?
9724962	9726843	You know, and I'm kind of in the boat as this guy.
9726863	9729804	I mean, he already said he's kind of like me where you either buy it new or you don't buy it.
9730124	9736127	And especially considering what I talked about at the top of the show, as in one particular store I will not be shopping at anymore for new or used games.
9736447	9738288	I mean, there's your biggest used market right there.
9739208	9741489	But not to say I would never buy a game used.
9741529	9744071	I mean, there's obviously other people trying to get in that market as well.
9744431	9746832	But honestly, I find now by the time...
9747412	9751173	I want to go back and get an old game and I'd be actually looking for it used.
9751193	9753454	Because you usually can't find the new game used.
9753534	9754535	It's so hard to get it.
9755155	9758836	I think the last new game that I bought used was the Tron game.
9759757	9762658	And the minute I played it, I could see why somebody sold it back right away.
9763038	9767219	So usually, if a game's really that good, you can't find it used right away.
9768180	9771121	We go buy used games, though, fairly regularly.
9771681	9774222	But that's just because we might want to finish a collection.
9774639	9793333	but I think at this point if I did want to go get a used game I would just check the price on Amazon or you know other competing internet websites like Best Buy or whatever and see what the price is and if it's good enough I'll just buy it online so until one of those stores pisses me off then I'll stop shopping there too alright next email
9795037	9795898	Hello, LLR.
9795998	9799322	Here's an Orange Lounge Foodio question, but it does relate to a video game.
9799682	9801664	Do you think Domino's will ever bring back the Noid?
9802005	9803747	We need a new Yo!
9803807	9804728	Noid game, dammit.
9806690	9811396	Brought to you by Sizzler, home of the three-day-old salad bar that tastes like shit and gives you the squits.
9811796	9812397	That's from Chiggers.
9813390	9813510	Eww!
9813530	9813690	Eww!
9813750	9813830	Eww!
9829445	9829825	Let's see.
9830345	9832006	Do I think Domino's would ever bring back the Noid?
9832406	9832646	No.
9832846	9838408	Domino's did this really interesting thing where they kind of came out and admitted that their pizza tastes like shit and that they're going to totally redo it.
9838828	9842088	It was this very interesting campaign that they did, and it worked.
9842389	9845069	Domino's sales have been up quite a bit in the past year or so.
9845389	9847370	People like that self-deprecating sense of humor.
9847650	9852711	And I think because of that, because Domino's is trying to distance themselves from the past, you're not going to see the Noid ever come back.
9852851	9854092	I think the Noid is something that's very 80s.
9854112	9854212	Well...
9855632	9858573	Never say never, but you're not going to see it in the next five years.
9858913	9859753	No.
9859853	9861794	And sadly, that would mean the same for the Yo!
9861854	9862374	Noid game.
9862654	9863935	Here's a question for you guys, though.
9864235	9868516	Do you think we'll see any other commercial product video games again?
9868736	9870837	Because we used to get these all the time back in the day.
9870857	9874038	There was the Mick Kids game, the California Raisins game.
9874158	9875838	Where the hell is my damn Burger King Connect game?
9875878	9878479	The Burger King games were the most recent ones.
9878519	9881500	They're supposed to have the Burger King Connect game, and they never fucking put it out.
9881880	9882240	I don't know.
9883361	9883841	So we'll see.
9885799	9887421	and now Burger King's all over Transformers.
9887441	9888603	But no games about chiggers.
9890606	9891868	Transformers, all Hasbro.
9891928	9892248	The end.
9892389	9892869	No, I'm kidding.
9893711	9894852	How about another email?
9895213	9895954	Yes, another email.
9895994	9896194	Yes.
9896354	9896575	Okay.
9898032	9904776	I'm a few shows behind in my listening, but I just want to respond to Rob with his opinion that college is a waste of money and you learn better by doing.
9905496	9906857	I 100% agree.
9907237	9914541	I spent five years in college, earned two bachelor's degrees, television production and Asian studies, graduated summa cum laude in the top 10% of my class.
9915221	9919704	I can be quoted as saying frequently that the only good thing that I got back from college was a husband.
9920244	9925607	Aside from being an abstract requirement, BKA have a BA when we don't care which one,
9926207	9928788	Nobody cares about all the painstaking work I did in college.
9928828	9930549	I haven't touched editing software since I left.
9930589	9933410	I haven't spoken Japanese, Chinese, or Spanish since I left.
9933910	9937232	All of the hard-earned knowledge has faded away and the reality has set in.
9937332	9943515	Unless you're going to be a doctor, lawyer, or something that requires daily use of the knowledge you got in college, it's ultimately a costly waste of time.
9944315	9950922	The job I have now has diddly to do with my fancy degrees and I'm still paying on the $2,000 I have left in college bills.
9951382	9956287	When I have kids, they're going to trade school and learn to be plumbers or HVAC technicians or car mechanics.
9956867	9964635	At least then I will be secure in the knowledge that what they've learned is useful and the very least will save them money because they can fix their own stuff.
9964695	9965015	Holly D.
9966036	9978523	Now, I do have to say though, in the design field, like what I'm in, college ends up being useful because the classes that I take have practical application for what I'm doing.
9979284	9980445	I've built my portfolio.
9981285	9982246	I've marketed myself.
9982726	9984827	I'm already getting work and I haven't finished college.
9985448	9986228	So I'm just saying.
9986368	9987349	Well, and I want to be careful too.
9987389	9991091	I don't want to become like this anti-college spokesperson because that wasn't quite the point of my rant.
9991171	9994273	But I think what I was meaning to get at is that it's not for everyone.
9994693	9998916	And I think some people kind of feel like there's this necessity, like I have to go, I have to go.
9999456	10000496	And maybe you don't.
10001457	10002618	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
10030513	10034574	Make sure you don't do nothing but school, okay?
10034914	10038014	If you're gonna go to college, make sure you do some extracurricular activities.
10038314	10039935	Make sure you do internships.
10040115	10050657	Oh my God, take, I mean, I know it might sound ludicrous, like I gotta do something and don't get paid, but the networking experience you're gonna get from that are gonna mean so much more than your A's and B's.
10051117	10051617	I'm serious.
10051817	10055977	Also, make friends with your teachers who are working in the field.
10056378	10057698	Yeah, you're not in high school anymore.
10057738	10058918	It's not cool to hate your teachers.
10059286	10062728	Well, I mean, keep in mind, now, I'm in school to be a graphic designer.
10063549	10067251	Which was funny because I learned a lot of the programs and stuff on my own.
10067792	10072295	But I have picked up so much in design technique and in theory.
10072715	10080440	And just in studying, you know, the best classes I've taken are my two art history classes and my typography class.
10080900	10082001	Those have been my favorites so far.
10082101	10085263	That and my portfolio class, which you've seen my portfolio.
10086124	10088946	It came out fully interview ready.
10089886	10091127	I've got my portfolio online.
10091187	10093649	If anyone wants to see my stuff, just let me know and I will show you.
10093949	10094849	And then hire me, please.
10096410	10097131	I will say this, too.
10097151	10104255	You might be surprised to hear me say this, but I actually think it also would be a good use of your time if this is a scene you are into and if this is something you are into.
10104915	10106136	Join a fraternity or a sorority.
10132250	10144374	Well, and also find different clubs or online groups that people in your field are going to like, you know, if you're in engineering, look for stuff through the Department of Engineers, you know, that type of stuff.
10144834	10149795	And if you're going to go to college just to drink, do yourself and do the college a favor and don't go to college.
10150755	10151996	Or at least get a liberal arts degree.
10152676	10153456	No, not even that.
10153476	10156317	I'm just going to say, do yourself a favor and don't go to college.
10156797	10158198	Like you will be wasting money.
10158518	10159538	You'll be wasting time.
10160680	10171024	One thing about college though that I will say is that it gives you a chance to experiment with new ideas and to pick different things.
10171384	10175666	Because I've changed my major like nine times before I finally just decided to go with what I loved anyway.
10176486	10179568	Because I started off as a forensic geology major.
10180028	10180568	Did you know that?
10181629	10184110	I studied rocks for blood.
10185670	10186791	It was boring as fuck.
10188064	10213154	and then you know I changed my major so many times and finally decided to stick with art with something in the art field I hate doing illustration for other people because it's not my drawings anymore but I love doing design for other people and I've developed a passion for it but I wouldn't have known that design was where my heart was until I tried to do illustration and I tried to do all this other stuff and eventually I found the right path
10214134	10218077	by, and I even found out that specifically print is my passion.
10218877	10221239	And I would never have known that if I had not taken typography.
10222340	10222860	Right then and there.
10223220	10224601	If I had not taken the InDesign class.
10225342	10233367	So, I'm just saying, you know, as that example, school is a good place to experiment without getting a job that you're going to hate.
10233948	10234428	You know what I mean?
10235169	10235329	So...
10236802	10238745	I'm not going to continue my rant.
10238825	10241689	I said what I said a couple shows ago and I stand by that.
10244013	10246476	It's not for everyone, but it might be for you and that's okay.
10247338	10247878	It's your money.
10247938	10249601	Spend it how you want to spend it.
10251010	10251570	Next email.
10252591	10253391	Hi, OLR crew.
10253451	10255892	This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.
10256532	10262094	I'm pretty sure you have already talked and discussed about Capcom this week, but I want to vent a little and share my two cents on their most recent happenings.
10262614	10267776	Well, needless to say, as many people have probably said now, I pretty much lost all faith in Capcom.
10268076	10271177	Was it because of the release of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3?
10271738	10274919	No, I actually was pretty excited about...
10276079	10302875	especially because of the addition of Phoenix Wright yeah granted they're doing an update to a game not even 9 months after the release of the first edition but Capcom has always done this kind of stuff with all their fighting series and I've learned to accept it if you know Capcom then you pretty much expect it to do so which by the way that actually did remind me of something when they did all the different matching service and different versions of Street Fighter 3 like Second Strike and Third Impact that's the same thing
10305055	10306836	So why have I lost my confidence in Capcom?
10306996	10309277	It's because of all their recent decisions as a company.
10309757	10312718	And there's a lot of things that I can name or list here.
10313278	10330323	Unnecessary DRM, Mercenaries 3DS, Bionic Commander Rearm 2, Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition, The Cancellation of Games, Mega Man Universe, Unnecessary Reboots, Devil May Cry, No Localizations of Games People Truly Want, No World of Monster Hunter, nor Ace Attorney Investigations 2 being localized.
10330843	10335926	Little by little, Capcom has done really bad decisions that have really affected the fans.
10336546	10345552	A company that was recently known to cater to the fans, and still even now they kind of do it, is losing a lot of stuff that have their fans really angry, including me.
10346012	10349634	And I think the straw that broke the camel was the cancellation of Mega Man Legends 3.
10350314	10355017	People have wanted that game for so long and they just took it from them like if nothing happened.
10355517	10355998	And with this...
10356878	10358820	Also comes the slow killing of Mega Man.
10358880	10363663	Mega Man X was the most wanted for MVC3 and they didn't mention him being in Ultimate.
10364404	10369607	All of those things they've done, little by little, have created a really big ball of shit and they can't hide it now.
10370048	10373270	And even if they do, the stinkest of big people will be reminded because of it.
10373650	10382496	Capcom has created their own demise, and unless they do something to fix this problem, or at least they admit they do have a problem, I won't be buying any game they release anytime soon.
10382576	10388079	And I mean it, not even the Darkstalkers teaser they showed in their Street Fighter cross-techin' panel.
10388360	10390221	Oh yeah, that hasn't even come up in the show yet, but yeah.
10391030	10398615	A game I have wanted them to make for a long time won't blind me of all they have done to lose me as a fan.
10398956	10402218	As Diekmann said in his Tumblr and Twitter, Capcom, it's not me, it's you.
10402758	10406141	Thanks for reading this and for keep on giving gamers a voice.
10407042	10407542	Actdeft.
10410003	10410563	Last email?
10411384	10413105	I'm curious to see how long that holds.
10413125	10414766	And I'm not trying to be like a jerk about it.
10414806	10416808	But, you know, usually this internet rage.
10417048	10419290	And then they'll announce something you just have to have.
10419870	10433580	But, you know, obviously Capcom surprisingly went from all the fans love them and have very loyal fans to literally within the scope of two weeks have become like, quote, the Japanese Bobby Kotick.
10433720	10434420	You know what I mean?
10434480	10436061	Like, it's just interesting.
10436081	10436882	How the mighty have fallen.
10437823	10438803	And, yeah, I...
10439964	10440284	Last email?
10458778	10459438	Hi, LLR.
10459958	10464500	Just wanted to write in after the last few weeks comments from Calcom's David Reeves.
10465240	10467741	I was more than a little miffed at what he said.
10468101	10479585	This coming from the same guy who used to run Sony of Europe and said that when the PS3 was launching that we have built up a certain brand equity over time since the launch of PlayStation in 1995 and PS2 in 2000.
10479745	10484547	The first 5 million are going to buy it, whatever it is, even if it doesn't have games.
10485387	10487808	And then he linked to the full article interview.
10488508	10490971	Anyway, I'm not going to rant, so I'll be off Catastrophic Moggy.
10492752	10494093	I like that, Catastrophic Moggy.
10496776	10498717	Yeah, it's kind of dickly.
10499959	10502321	Not Moggy, but all the stuff.
10504082	10505303	Oh, that's not the interview.
10506224	10507325	Sorry, I'm reading over your shoulder here.
10507966	10508907	No, this is the interview.
10510928	10512149	It's a pretty long one, but...
10514075	10518838	One of the questions, are you confident in your approach and the inevitable build-up to November's launch hype?
10519379	10527864	He says, without being too arrogant, I don't think we worry too much about building up the hype in the first six months because when the rubber hits the road is going to be when all those hardcore gamers have bought PS3s.
10529185	10532707	They have also bought Xbox 360s and they probably bought Nintendo Wii as well.
10533208	10536990	So basically, you know... There's a lot that haven't, though.
10537030	10540152	There's a lot of people that only adopt one of those systems, you know?
10540512	10540752	Yeah.
10540772	10541533	I don't know.
10543186	10545650	That guy says a lot of very interesting things, that's for sure.
10546551	10547873	All right, that's going to do it for email tonight.
10547893	10551899	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
10552359	10558027	In the meantime, I believe it's time to get the ranting on in a segment we call the FUs of the Week.
10558128	10559470	Let's go to the FUs of the Week right now.
10575534	10577536	An F you to the bee sting I got on my neck.
10578937	10581499	And the stinger didn't break the skin.
10582880	10585222	Well, it broke the skin, but not like it didn't get stuck in there.
10586543	10587824	But it is enough.
10588004	10589746	I'm allergic to bees.
10590006	10593069	So it's enough that it's pretty bad.
10593769	10602038	I also got another, I got a scrape from the stinger on my leg from a dead bee in the pool, and that thankfully didn't swell up, but I got another one and I have no idea when I got it.
10602478	10607824	It was just, I felt it and that was it.
10607884	10608385	Go ahead, Loki.
10610126	10615072	F you to, I guess, live up green so far away.
10616798	10618439	and my F.U.
10618479	10620921	goes to a couple things tonight F.U.
10620941	10628566	to Johnny Rockets because I went there to eat the other day and it took like 25 minutes to get our food and I wasn't even busy and also F.U.
10628606	10640814	to them because once the food finally did fucking come the burgers I had were fucking delicious there were sliders, that's why I said burgers I'm not that fat those sliders are fucking good the orange dreamsicle shake
10643255	10649118	No, no, I don't... Like, I'm actually trying to lose weight right now, so Johnny, I had to cut back on something.
10649138	10651979	No, no, no, you should not cut back on the Orange Dream School shake.
10652039	10653380	That is delicious.
10653740	10655200	Oh, I, uh, yeah, so F you.
10655440	10658322	Yeah, and F you to the fact that they derailed my diet because that food is so delicious.
10658342	10663184	I don't know if you, well, I don't know which Johnny Rockets you went to, but they have one... The one at Arden, I'll say Arden Fair Mall.
10663304	10663564	Arden?
10663964	10666705	Well, they have a new one now that's across from the new Palladio Theaters.
10666966	10667366	Oh, okay.
10667386	10668886	Yeah, so it's pretty awesome.
10669026	10669387	Interesting.
10671228	10676151	I bet they didn't take... Well, see, if the place was packed and busy, then I would understand why it would take so long.
10676191	10676691	It was empty.
10676711	10677092	It was weird.
10677412	10678773	So anyway, if you did that.
10679233	10683956	And if you did those burgers being delicious and making me want to go through that torture again just to have them and screw up my diet.
10684256	10685497	I've lost 10 pounds in three months.
10685637	10685957	Almost.
10686097	10687458	Nine pounds in three months.
10687759	10689019	Get a bicycle and go riding with me.
10691107	10693629	We live too far apart to do that every day, especially this time of year.
10694830	10695070	All right.
10695610	10696731	And then, oh, the other FU.
10696751	10697432	I have one more FU.
10697732	10703556	And then FU goes to Salacious Pop, not only for eliminating Pennywise from the list, but we went to the casino last night.
10703716	10704376	I lost $20.
10705477	10710480	This bitch puts like $5 in the slot machine and on his second pull wins $70.
10713479	10714140	Did he buy you dinner?
10731553	10732853	Did you stomp your little foot?
10733613	10735014	I wasn't mad that he won.
10735054	10736074	I was mad that I lost.
10736114	10737254	And he won on his second bullet.
10737494	10738815	You should see how fast I went through $20.
10738875	10741195	He was just gone in a snap.
10741235	10744196	And then he's like, oh, I think I'm winning all this money.
10744336	10746456	The coin thing keeps going.
10746536	10747416	Do I get to keep all this?
10750157	10751597	Now you see why I don't like to gamble.
10752878	10753738	Oh, I still love to gamble.
10753758	10754698	I don't even play a lottery.
10755638	10756278	I'll play the lottery.
10756318	10756958	I love gambling.
10757278	10758699	It's a bad problem I have.
10759139	10767820	Anyhow, let's move on to a couple more news stories for you guys in the Skype line as well as the results of tonight's list list.
10768320	10770421	So let's do a couple more stories for you guys.
10770461	10770721	Loki.
10772621	10782903	You may remember a couple weeks back we talked a little bit about people that had games on the indie games store on the Xbox Marketplace.
10783792	10792876	We're complaining that they just weren't getting enough exposure and the sales weren't very well, even for some of the top games on that service.
10793396	10801419	Well, one of those companies, Z-Boy Games, they, of course, released Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of
10802960	10805381	They now have put their games on Steam.
10806142	10808903	And they're very pleased on how things are going.
10809063	10819109	In fact, they're saying that Z-Boy Games has already made more revenue in less than a week on Steam than we have in over a year and a half on Xbox Indie Games.
10820737	10821698	That sucks.
10822738	10825960	It sucks for the indie games, but good for them that they're making money.
10828002	10843391	Basically saying that they decided because of this that they're definitely looking at launching more games onto Steam versus the Xbox indie game service.
10844712	10844812	Hmm.
10847864	10851508	And of course, you may remember they also took donation support.
10852029	10854932	That's a pretty big slap in the face to Xbox Live Indie Games.
10854972	10859937	And I think a pretty obvious showing of how Steam's doing it right and Xbox isn't doing it right when it comes to the indie games.
10859998	10863321	But to be fair, there is a little bit of apples and oranges going on here because...
10864122	10881575	You know, Steam, that really was like their only new release that week Whereas with Xbox Live, you still have all the arcade games and all that stuff that they do have to promote But, I'm not going to say I totally disagree I think they should start featuring some indie games in the main banner once in a great while Especially these big ones that do very well
10881937	10890400	If they would take the indie games and, like, say, have a certain release day for those and maybe a little bit more quality control with the stuff that's released.
10890760	10907507	You know, because I know with, like, WiiWare and stuff, you have, you know, blog sites and everything that lists, okay, here's the... And actually, Kotaku's been pretty good about... They don't know... I don't know if they do all the indie games that are released that week or if it's just the ones that they're playing or, like, you know, the...
10907987	10909368	The ones that they think are kind of cool.
10909728	10916854	They'll do a thread every week or so pointing those out and how much you can get them for and the links to download them and that kind of stuff.
10917274	10923759	I think that they should have something like that where the PlayStation Network comes out and says, hey, here's what's releasing on our service.
10924660	10929204	Not necessarily promoting them, but it's at least mentioning them so people are aware of them.
10930525	10932346	Granted, there's a lot of crap on there too, but...
10935468	10943952	There's something wrong if they're making more money on Steam than they are in the indie game service in less than a week.
10946193	10953916	Why would you waste your time on indie games if you can just put your game on Steam and make that money in a week?
10954815	10956776	Yeah, that's kind of scary.
10956876	10963538	But then again, if all... I mean, Xbox Live gets a lot of indie games, and these were obviously two of the quality ones.
10963939	10968240	If everything that went out on Xbox Live went up on Steam, they wouldn't all sell as well.
10968260	10969181	That's the difference.
10969201	10979725	Well, yes, they wouldn't all sell as well, but the ones that people are actually putting effort into and are considered hits on the indie game service aren't making that much money anyways.
10980385	10981426	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11001984	11004847	Quote, at Grasshopper, I'm creating sound, but not only sound.
11005207	11011773	I'm the leader of the development team, so I'm tag-teaming with Suda51, and I'm actually involved with game creation as well as sound.
11012333	11016277	He said that there are a few titles they're going to announce soon, so stay tuned.
11017378	11017898	There you go.
11018979	11023083	By the way, I guess in this podcast, he also talked about how he almost quit Konami after his first week.
11024204	11025004	Be interesting to see.
11025625	11026806	So, all right.
11028766	11030567	I'm all for more Akira Yamaoka games.
11031628	11034990	I'm glad he didn't, like, leave the industry altogether, that he's still making games.
11035350	11036911	Silent Hill just isn't the same without him.
11037471	11039252	Um, yeah.
11039452	11039812	Yeah.
11040733	11041213	Yeah.
11041774	11041974	Yeah.
11042194	11043154	Yeah.
11043174	11047137	Uh, going to our chatroom at chat.orange.com, there is a little bit of a buffer, so they're still on the last story.
11047177	11053420	SalaciousPop says, Steam Valve would probably say no to 90% of the shit that Xbox Live Indie Games has on their store, though.
11053440	11053520	Good.
11053540	11054401	I think that they should.
11055851	11057933	See, who is it to determine quality?
11058033	11061254	Because I would say there's some shit on Steam, too.
11062055	11067298	But one thing I do like about Steam is that they provide quick links to find reviews and so forth.
11067778	11070680	And Metacritic, love it or hate it, their score is right there.
11071420	11075262	I think they only show it if it's above a certain score, though, because it's not there for every game.
11075943	11077824	But kind of interesting nonetheless.
11078504	11083368	All right, we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11083408	11086351	The Skype line is open now for your calls if you want to give us a call.
11087292	11089414	We're going to try to keep the calls probably a little brief tonight.
11089434	11091175	We're running extraordinarily long tonight.
11091215	11094278	We're already at a three-hour show and we haven't even gotten into calls yet.
11094678	11096500	So we're going to take those calls.
11097061	11098542	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
11098622	11099943	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11100704	11102505	Let's see if Loki has any last-minute stories.
11104546	11104926	Not much.
11106627	11112648	They had a Tekken Bowl, I guess, was released this week for free on iOS, which is kind of lame.
11113288	11115689	Is that like bowling with Tekken characters?
11115749	11117909	Yes, it is.
11117929	11118129	What?
11118149	11119789	Oh, right, right, right.
11119809	11127351	And actually, you're right, because they're going to be featuring that as well in the Tekken Tag HD or whatever that they're doing.
11128391	11129692	But yeah, you can download it for free.
11131372	11131732	Getting it.
11133352	11135134	Alright, our phone's ringing, so let's go to it.
11135174	11137415	Hi, you're on the phone, Orange Launch Radio.
11137435	11137796	Who's this?
11138396	11139797	Hey, it's the one and only Ranma.
11140057	11140558	Of course.
11140638	11141298	What's up, Ranma?
11142079	11144040	A whole lot of stuff, okay?
11144060	11144781	Just stuff.
11146142	11146942	What kind of stuff?
11149644	11150445	Love you too, Rob.
11150705	11151206	Love you too.
11151726	11151986	I know.
11152687	11153027	What's up?
11153988	11159652	Well, first off, yeah, I was stoned off my tookus last week.
11159692	11160993	That's why I ended up with a PlayStation 3.
11161033	11162134	That's the first thing.
11166042	11168022	Wait, you were stoned and you bought a PlayStation 3?
11169003	11172843	I was so stoned off my took that the decision to buy one was a good idea.
11173103	11174004	I see, I see.
11174744	11177544	So wait, you bought a PS3 when you were high and you regret it now?
11178304	11178924	Actually, no.
11180025	11183125	It's just an expensive blueberry player like everybody else says, but, you know.
11183625	11184886	It has a few good games on it.
11185646	11185926	I know.
11187026	11188686	LittleBigPlanet, I'm telling you.
11189066	11192807	It's probably one of the greatest games of this generation, period, on either console.
11194104	11194884	It's in the queue.
11195164	11195965	It's in the queue.
11196085	11196865	Alright, fair enough.
11197505	11197885	Thank you.
11198965	11204467	Now, about this whole Capcom debacle.
11204847	11211349	I'm probably the only person that actually feels that Capcom was in the right to cancel the game.
11211689	11215630	The only fuck up was how they handled the whole PR spin on the whole thing.
11216684	11244134	I don't necessarily agree that it was right because I personally am a fan of Mega Man Legends but I am kind of trying to see it from their point of view and I do understand the business perspective if they don't make money then it's not worth our time but I do agree that their biggest faux pas was how they handled it yeah but defend yourself a little bit to the fanboys why do you you're not even saying like you're just flat out saying I agree with Capcom they should just cancel it why
11245498	11253842	In this age of money's getting kind of tight, a lot of these companies, as much money as they're making, we don't know how much of that is revenue, profit, this or that.
11254643	11261426	Who knows, if they invest a lot of money making this game and it doesn't fit the bill, then they're out a lot of money.
11261987	11263767	These companies really can't afford to do that.
11264288	11266029	And what I find interesting is that
11266869	11269571	There's not that many Mega Man Legends fans out there.
11269871	11279378	Granted, if you look at the online petition, there's so many fans, but most of them are just jumping on the bandwagon just because they need a common cause to fight over.
11279838	11284161	I will admit, I wonder how many of those people would actually buy the game and how many are just wanting to pirate it.
11284841	11287283	Yeah, because I had the first Mega Man Legends game.
11287703	11289024	I'm not going to say it's crap.
11289144	11290765	I thought it was a pretty good game.
11291586	11294208	I didn't get the second one, you know, because it wasn't
11295354	11299856	It was a good concept, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.
11300596	11304098	I kind of wish I could find the game again.
11304118	11304978	I kind of want to play it.
11305058	11307879	Is it on PlayStation 3 download stuff?
11308800	11309220	I don't know.
11309240	11310000	I don't think it is.
11310760	11311001	Anyway.
11312181	11313262	Kind of surprised it wasn't.
11313302	11315482	It might have drummed up more interest for a third one, but oh well.
11316463	11319064	Yeah, but that's how it goes.
11321525	11327269	What about other stuff going on in Capcom's world, like the Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 news?
11327289	11328090	How do you feel about that?
11328670	11330892	I'm amused that Phoenix Wright is in the game.
11331592	11333373	That is kind of awesome, but is it $40 awesome?
11335149	11338432	I tend to think so because I have to agree with what the Rob D said.
11338652	11340354	They're rebalancing the characters.
11340554	11344618	They're adding new stages and adding more features and functionality to make it worth the $40.
11345439	11349482	I mean, they kind of did the same thing when they re-released Super Street Fighter 4.
11350043	11354827	I mean, if they did the whole $59.99 price tag, I sure as hell would wait until it drops to $39.
11355328	11356008	That's just me.
11356669	11359592	Which is, I think, the price point they're going to try and put it out at.
11360633	11360833	Mm-hmm.
11364073	11365254	Oh, sorry about that.
11365294	11365954	I dropped my phone.
11365974	11366835	That wasn't good.
11366855	11369437	I hope you have AppleCare on it.
11369577	11370177	No, it's fine.
11370237	11371538	No, and I don't have AppleCare either.
11372219	11375041	Of course, I'd be just outside a year or two, so no, it's fine.
11375281	11375541	I'm good.
11375581	11375921	We're good.
11376762	11377022	All right.
11377422	11380645	Anyhow, well, on that note, anything else on your mind tonight?
11381205	11386569	Last thing, I don't know if you heard, but Sears is having this massive video game clearance sale at all of their stores.
11387369	11389411	Or are they just unloading all the video games altogether?
11389949	11394055	Yeah, but the thing is, your mileage may vary, because I've been hitting various stores.
11394135	11400203	Like, I do know right now, most of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band bundles are $20.
11401906	11402246	Nice!
11402286	11405788	Toys R Us did something like that a couple weeks ago, and I do kind of want a new Guitar Hero bundle.
11408170	11409711	Including the big Super Bundles.
11409951	11415854	I went to one Sears, and I picked up Guitar Hero Metallica for 96 cents, so I bought the last three.
11415934	11416815	Holy shit.
11417255	11421777	For the record, by the way, I don't know if you've got Big Lots out there?
11421917	11424679	I think they opened one up by me somewhere.
11424719	11426140	We mostly have amazing savings.
11426525	11428686	Dan picked up DJ Hero for me, the bundle, for $20.
11428786	11432789	It was a couple months ago, but they get them in.
11433249	11437672	And we found a DDR there for $20 with a pad and everything.
11438332	11438732	Nice.
11439353	11448658	I was thinking about picking up the DJ Hero 2 bundle and sell the turntable and find somebody that wanted a turntable because I already have two, but nobody I know wants it.
11448698	11453121	So I was like, there's no point in me buying it because I refuse to sell to...
11453939	11455120	The Evil People, you know?
11455441	11455961	Right, right.
11456522	11457924	And I'm too lazy to put it on Craigslist.
11457944	11460106	It would be kind of hard, too, if you don't have the game, you know what I mean?
11460827	11462429	Mm-hmm.
11462909	11463650	But you know how that rolls.
11464371	11467715	All right, well, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks for calling.
11467915	11468536	Hey, no problem.
11468716	11469417	All right, bye-bye.
11471485	11472245	Let's go to the phones.
11472305	11473526	We got other calls coming in.
11473546	11475487	Let me go to pick up the phone again.
11475567	11476528	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11476548	11476888	Who's this?
11477488	11478088	Hey, what's up, guys?
11478108	11478789	This is Kai Judo.
11478909	11479569	Hey, Kai Judo.
11479589	11480229	What's on your mind, buddy?
11480910	11481170	Not much.
11481230	11481950	I'm going to make it quick.
11481990	11485852	I just want to add my two cents to the Capcom Marvel... What is it?
11485952	11486653	Marvel 3 now?
11487153	11489134	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Ultimate, yes.
11490242	11495970	My thing is, okay, so this new game is supposed to have more content than the original, right?
11496290	11496531	Right.
11497252	11498974	And the original is $60, right?
11499115	11499355	Right.
11500316	11502479	And this new version is going to be $40, right?
11502940	11503160	Yes.
11503801	11505524	Why not make all of those fucking fighting games $40?
11507608	11508669	That's a great question.
11508749	11510290	Why not make all the fucking fighting games $40?
11510950	11512091	I will say this though.
11512151	11519176	When I was at the place that I will not talk about anymore, I did see that they had dropped the price of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 to $40.
11520057	11522939	But that certainly wasn't its price new originally.
11524292	11528414	Yeah, I think that, to me, when I think fighting game, I always think retro.
11528894	11531995	So I always think that those games should be low price.
11532035	11535936	I never understood the $60 for Street Fighter.
11535996	11538777	I waited for the second version of Street Fighter.
11539057	11540538	It's dropped down to $30.
11540838	11541338	Oh, has it?
11541438	11544099	Oh, then the place that shouldn't be named is just overcharging now.
11544139	11545099	What a surprise.
11545379	11546399	It was recent.
11546519	11548080	It was Thursday, Friday.
11548351	11549252	I remember dropping $70 on that game.
11564471	11566133	I've spent $65 on Killer Instinct.
11566233	11574844	I mean, Super Nintendo games were expensive, and that was $70 a few years ago, which, you know, inflation and all that means it was probably more like $100 you paid for that game.
11575485	11578749	So you can't always say that fighting games have always been cheap.
11579870	11581252	Yeah, yeah, that's for sure.
11581272	11583194	But I mean, now I think they're kind of...
11584156	11584637	But seriously?
11599309	11599770	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11622813	11623614	Yep, no problem.
11623774	11624594	Alright, any other thoughts?
11625415	11627516	Yeah, you guys need to get on Minecraft.
11628157	11628917	The pay version.
11629058	11629358	Try it.
11629778	11630879	I really do not like Minecraft.
11630999	11632080	I know, I tried.
11632140	11632480	I tried.
11632500	11633681	Well, at least it was the free version.
11633721	11637984	But even Terraria... No, the free... I didn't mean to cut you off.
11638004	11640906	But the free version is totally different from the pay version.
11640946	11641286	Trust me.
11641607	11644309	The pay version... We'll see.
11644389	11647531	If I run out of the other games that I have, maybe I'll check it out.
11647751	11650153	But I've tried playing Terraria this week.
11650731	11654134	It was okay, but I was like, oh wow, this really is just Minecraft.
11654955	11656477	Yeah, I kind of hit that too.
11656537	11659800	I did play some in Minecraft.
11660140	11662342	Although Dan did show me something interesting today.
11662442	11666646	Someone created the whole Middle Earth pretty much in Minecraft.
11667247	11671271	Including underground places and the whole dwarven areas and whatnot.
11671291	11671371	Yeah.
11671451	11672351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11695199	11696900	I'm going to go ahead and close up Skype, I think, tonight.
11697001	11698342	So sorry to those of you that didn't get through.
11698382	11701885	Sorry it was a shorter segment than usual, but we're running really long tonight, so sorry about that.
11702605	11705728	So we're going to go ahead and wrap up the last-minute story so we can wrap up the show.
11705848	11706669	So, Loki?
11707330	11707790	I got nothing.
11708651	11708751	Oh.
11709271	11709752	Well, all right, then.
11709792	11710532	DarkSakura, anything?
11711633	11715877	Well, SalaciousPop brought up that Capcom published Street Fighter Alpha 2 for the SNES.
11716798	11719000	It was really sucky, and it had loading time.
11719907	11721548	Oh yeah, it was like a Super Nintendo cartridge.
11721609	11722349	I own it.
11722689	11723110	I own it.
11723410	11723670	Yeah?
11723970	11725312	Yeah.
11726613	11727974	And no, I'm not going to pay for Minecraft.
11729457	11757587	I don't know I might when I run out of other games to play I'll kind of get to that but I still have so many games I gotta beat and then Minecraft seems like one of those time sinks you spend a lot of time but I gotta admit I would like to explore I like exploring worlds especially recreations of stuff so like if there's ways to go in and explore that middle earth stuff that might be kind of fun actually that'd be kind of cool alright well let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can close up shop for tonight so Loki what's your final thought tonight?
11758791	11786681	my final thought is I can't wait till Tuesday god I hope he brought better fucking bring Saints Row 3rd I'm very disappointed otherwise cause we got like a bunch of people coming in I know that we're Ubisoft will probably bring Just Dance 3 cause they brought Just Dance 2 last year THQ last year brought Smackdown vs. Raw 11 but I think if they're bringing the biggest game it's gonna be Saints Row 3rd
11787621	11817090	and then of course Microsoft will be there this year which is kind of cool and I know LucasArts is going to be bringing the Star Wars Kinect game so lots of stuff to play well then good I want to hear your rundowns on it next week so my final thought is this show ran long and it's getting late I'm getting hungry so it's time to go DarkSakura your final thought tonight I just texted Dan that I have hungers and he needs to bring me my burger you want a taco or no you want a burger
11817750	11818732	Dan's bringing me a burger.
11818852	11820656	I don't have to pay for a burger.
11821117	11823022	How about a taco burger?
11823062	11823884	I want a fish taco.
11825086	11825547	Maybe tomorrow.
11826092	11828453	Alright, well that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

11889396	11899003	And just a note to myself, when I'm scripting next week's show, if I'm going to put a listless on, I should also put, at the end, listless results, and then that way I won't forget it.
11899784	11904748	But you guys did vote tonight's listless, and it was kind of close, but not really.
11905168	11906349	Here's your top three answers.
11906749	11907970	Characters you want to see...
11911098	11911859	I'm malfunctioning.
11912159	11916402	Character you most want to see in a future Mortal Kombat game since they're putting anyone in now.
11916922	11920004	Number three answer as voted by you folks listening.
11920584	11921625	Mr. Rogers.
11924107	11926268	An answer that made me so happy I think I've burped.
11927329	11929270	Mr. Rogers there is number three answer.
11929290	11930231	There you go.
11930531	11933393	Your number two answer for character you most want to see in Mortal Kombat.
11934053	11937535	Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill is the number two answer.
11938056	11940097	And the number one answer.
11940157	11944640	This is the character you most want more than any fucking one in Mortal Kombat.
11945180	11945941	No disputing.
11945981	11946681	This is done.
11947002	11947582	Definitive.
11948483	11949583	Ash from Evil Dead.
11949743	11950144	Yes.
11951204	11952405	Hail to the king, baby.
11952845	11953566	Shop smart.
11953966	11954847	Shop F smart.
11955687	11956188	There it is.
11957408	11957749	All right.
11958029	11959650	That and Bruce Campbell's fucking awesome.
11959730	11960671	And you know he'd voice it.
11960691	11961171	I did.
11961812	11963533	So there it is, your listless results.
11963653	11966035	And now the credits to our show can roll.
