14000	16000	Tonight, July 24th, 2011
16000	18000	Games appear to be incoming to Google Plus

23000	27000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	35000	and welcome back to another week of the show
35000	37000	where every gamer has a voice
37000	39000	Orange Lounge Radio
39000	41000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you
41000	43000	to talk about video games and gaming culture
43000	45000	and all of that with my co-host
45000	47000	the one and only Dark Sakura
47000	49000	Jamie Summers
49000	51000	How are you doing?
51000	53000	Wasn't there a video game like that in Japan
53000	55000	that was all about putting your thumbs up
55000	57000	people's butts and things like that?
57000	59000	I'm not even lying, that was actually the premise
59000	61000	Yeah, it was like a boonga boonga or something
61000	63000	Who wants to be a proctologist?
63000	65000	But it was like spanking people stressfully
65000	67000	for something, you could either use your finger
67000	69000	or spank them
69000	71000	I know and I'm stressed out
71000	73000	Dark Sakura, you've been very very naughty
73000	75000	Thank you sir, may I have another?
75000	77000	No
77000	79000	Alright, say hello as well to the one and only
79000	81000	Rob Foster, Loki!
81000	83000	How are you doing, Loki?
83000	85000	You're actually muted, there you go
85000	87000	How are you doing now, Loki?
87000	89000	I'm doing better
89000	91000	We're having mic fail tonight in studio
91000	93000	If I sound different by the way, don't adjust your speakers
93000	95000	It's on our end, I'm on backup mic tonight
95000	97000	He's on helium
97000	99000	Yes, maybe a little bit
99000	101000	No, I think I'm just on the overly sensitive mic
101000	103000	which for my voice is really not good
103000	105000	but that's all we got tonight
105000	107000	Let's switch mics
107000	109000	I have a rant or two in you tonight
109000	111000	and I'm not letting you do that on this mic
111000	113000	You will blow up speakers across America
113000	115000	and beyond
115000	117000	Well what's new in your world, Loki?
117000	119000	Nothing
119000	121000	So Josh is turning one very soon, right?
121000	123000	Yeah, a week from Monday
123000	125000	Your baby is turning one
125000	127000	and the other week you were talking about
127000	129000	your possible party plans you were doing
129000	131000	and I was talking to the wife today
131000	133000	and it sounds like you guys have settled on a theme, correct?
133000	135000	Well yeah, it was always going to be
135000	137000	like the pork party
137000	139000	Oh, I thought at one point you were talking about
139000	141000	the pedo bear party or the...
141000	143000	No, those were just funny ideas we were throwing around
143000	145000	I see, I see
145000	147000	So you are going to do the pork party?
147000	149000	Teach the child at a young age about the wonders of bacon, right?
149000	151000	Of course
151000	153000	Well have fun with that, that'll be a lot of fun
153000	155000	Alright, we're going to have fun with you guys here
155000	157000	live at All Games Radio
157000	159000	www.allgames.com
159000	161000	as we do every week, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific
161000	163000	9 o'clock Eastern
163000	165000	at the Bobby Black Wolf Show
165000	167000	If you want to join us and chat, we are ready to go
167000	169000	in our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com
169000	171000	and we do read comments
171000	173000	from chat throughout the show
173000	175000	For instance, some folks commenting
175000	177000	on Booga Booga, the game we were talking about
177000	179000	a minute ago, Act Def says
179000	181000	that game didn't make it outside of Japan
181000	183000	I wonder why, y'all
183000	185000	But no, like Google it
185000	187000	it was a real game
187000	189000	so it's something else
189000	191000	I had the money and it was cheap enough
191000	193000	I'd import it, it's really expensive
193000	195000	Give that to Josh for his birthday
195000	197000	It'd just be fun to have
197000	199000	just put it in my garage
199000	201000	What the hell's that?
201000	203000	Hey guys, want to come over?
203000	205000	You guys would come over if I said, hey guys
205000	207000	I got Booga Booga in my garage
207000	209000	I'd be like, hell yeah, I'm coming over
209000	211000	I'd be like, I'll be there in 15
211000	213000	It'd just be weird
213000	215000	Hide your cameras
215000	217000	We always like to start off the show
217000	219000	with a little bit of how is your gaming week
219000	221000	So let's go around and talk about the video games
221000	223000	we've been playing this week
223000	225000	DarkSakura, what have you been doing?
225000	227000	I played well
227000	229000	I finally hit my next item level
229000	231000	Congrats, addict, dealer
231000	233000	I played some other games
233000	235000	I played Kid Dracula
235000	237000	again, because I love that game
237000	239000	Going back, kicking it Game Boy
239000	241000	Kid Dracula is an old ass game
241000	243000	Yeah
243000	245000	We actually watched a playthrough
245000	247000	of the NES version
247000	249000	I was playing the Game Boy version
249000	251000	and I have been fighting and fighting with Planet Harriers
251000	253000	to get it to work on MAME
253000	255000	to no avail
255000	257000	It's because it's not done yet
257000	259000	I know, but there's Hikaru, Bios
259000	261000	and all this other stuff I was playing with
261000	263000	and it's not working
263000	265000	So
265000	267000	So some classic gaming in your week
267000	269000	Yeah, lots of classic gaming
269000	271000	and Peggle
271000	273000	Which is destined to become a classic in the future
273000	275000	I think
275000	277000	It's too new
277000	279000	Hopefully EA won't ruin the franchise
279000	281000	I did find out, however, that someone did
281000	283000	bejeweled for the Cliccovision
283000	285000	Oh really? Like a homebrew?
285000	287000	Yeah, bejeweled for the Cliccovision
287000	289000	Does it actually exist on an actual cartridge
289000	291000	or is it, you can't really do that
291000	293000	it's only through emulators
293000	295000	I'm sure, anything that's a ROM
295000	297000	you can put on a cartridge
297000	299000	as long as you have the right, you know
299000	301000	thing to write to it
301000	303000	Dan also found something
303000	305000	this Cliccovision that they were going to be working on
305000	307000	that they
307000	309000	halted production, but someone finished it
309000	311000	and has like a full arcade version
311000	313000	of Donkey Kong
313000	315000	So Dan was playing that day and then he played the homebrew
315000	317000	Donkey Kong 2 on his computer today
317000	319000	So we've been all about the homebrew
319000	321000	I saw an
321000	323000	interesting little cabinet the other day
323000	325000	I was at this pizza joint in town
325000	327000	that had, it wasn't an old
327000	329000	I'll tell you that right off the bat
329000	331000	It was some other type of machine that had a lot
331000	333000	of classic games in it, but the interesting thing about it
333000	335000	is it was Pac-Man
335000	337000	and Donkey Kong and Galaga
337000	339000	and it was kind of like, you don't usually
339000	341000	see Nintendo games participating
341000	343000	in the collections
343000	345000	because Nintendo keeps that
345000	347000	stuff to Nintendo, so it was kind of weird
347000	349000	like where did this, like the Play Choice
349000	351000	Yeah, where did, no it wasn't Play Choice though
351000	353000	it was like actual arcade Pac-Man and Galaga
353000	355000	and stuff, so
355000	357000	Let's talk about the Nintendo ones, oh yeah I remember those
357000	359000	The Nintendo were the Play Choice games, or like the Wii
359000	361000	and stuff now, you don't see a lot of like the retro
361000	363000	It had to have been the homebrew type of
363000	365000	I don't know, it was interesting
365000	367000	though, because I remember
367000	369000	SalaciousPop commenting on it like, those are
369000	371000	games you wouldn't usually see together in a collection
371000	373000	Yeah, but I don't think it's a homebrew
373000	375000	thing, they have
375000	377000	other machines that are very similar to
377000	379000	you know
379000	381000	the
381000	383000	multi-game machines, they have like
383000	385000	packs that you can buy
385000	387000	so it's like okay, here's Atari games, here's
387000	389000	Nintendo, here's
389000	391000	Capcom or whatever
391000	393000	So they've got those out there
395000	397000	It's just I didn't know Nintendo to usually participate
397000	399000	in those, usually it's kind of like they
399000	401000	keep it for their own systems and so forth
403000	405000	Eh, maybe
405000	407000	Alright well let's move on, Loki how was your gaming week?
407000	409000	Same old
409000	411000	stuff, didn't really play a whole ton
411000	413000	of stuff other than basically
413000	415000	Grand Theft Auto and
415000	417000	I think I did play a little
417000	419000	bit of Earth Defense Force in there this
419000	421000	week, mainly Grand Theft
421000	423000	Auto
423000	425000	Just, you know
425000	427000	What do you expect when I play at lunch all the time?
427000	429000	It's basically
429000	431000	what we've been doing
431000	433000	I thought that was going to get replaced with Earth Defense Force
433000	435000	in South Armageddon now that that was out
435000	437000	It does, but here's the thing
437000	439000	My boss usually wants to play during lunch
439000	441000	and you know, it's only so many
441000	443000	players for Earth Defense Force
443000	445000	You don't have a third copy
445000	447000	You know, he just really
447000	449000	puts the peer pressure on
449000	451000	about wanting to get kicked
451000	453000	get his ass kicked
453000	455000	in Grand Theft Auto and so I have to
455000	457000	oblige, you know
457000	459000	Are you going to tell your
459000	461000	boss, no I'm not going to come speak to your ass
461000	463000	at Grand Theft Auto? Thank you for reminding me
463000	465000	Has he ever threatened to fire you over how good
465000	467000	you are at Grand Theft Auto? Yes, lots of times
467000	469000	Almost
469000	471000	every week
471000	473000	I'm always like, you know we have reviews
473000	475000	coming up soon
475000	477000	I'm like, I don't care
477000	479000	No, it was funny
479000	481000	We have these nice
481000	483000	Sony headsets
483000	485000	Like, headphones, I should say, not headsets
485000	487000	Headphones that we use
487000	489000	for the gameplay
489000	491000	We have it hooked up through the stereo connectors
491000	493000	on all the VGA cables
493000	495000	But, you know
495000	497000	As you know, you can't really
497000	499000	talk over a headset
499000	501000	because the headset goes on your head
501000	503000	and it's usually meant for people that have TVs
503000	505000	Really? A headset goes on your head? Yeah, I know
505000	507000	A headset goes on your head
507000	509000	I've been doing it wrong!
509000	511000	You'd have to wear a second pair, like a second set of
511000	513000	headphones on top of it, so it's just
513000	515000	not practical
515000	517000	So what did I do? I thought, hey, you know what?
517000	519000	I got a few of these wired headsets
519000	521000	from Microsoft, I'm going to break them apart
521000	523000	and make them work
523000	525000	And so that's what I did, I snapped the
525000	527000	headpiece off
527000	529000	broke the thing apart, I took out the
529000	531000	actual speaker from the
531000	533000	headphone, and then of course
533000	535000	the only way I could attach it to it is with
535000	537000	plain old
537000	539000	tape
539000	541000	Scotch tape
541000	543000	Not even duct tape
543000	545000	Here's the reason why I did Scotch tape
545000	547000	because these are nice headphones
547000	549000	I don't want to ruin them
549000	551000	I just want it to stay
551000	553000	And it works great, because now we have the nice headphones
553000	555000	and we can talk
555000	557000	you know, for the occasional
557000	559000	person that's from
559000	561000	Mexico, or
561000	563000	Usually it's the UK
563000	565000	We've got people that complain in the UK
565000	567000	and every now and then it's like
567000	569000	gee, I really wish I had a headset so I could
569000	571000	tell them to shut the hell up, because
571000	573000	you know, they'll be like, oh, you have
573000	575000	to use the stickies to kill me, what?
575000	577000	You suck, you just can't, you know
577000	579000	kill me with anything else, so then I proceed to kill
579000	581000	them with every weapon in the game, and then they still
581000	583000	complain, so
583000	585000	So you've gotten in lately
585000	587000	long story short, you've fixed headphones
587000	589000	so that you could smack talk people on
589000	591000	Xbox Live this week. Yes. And what types of things
591000	593000	do you tell them off with? Do you want some
593000	595000	tea and crumpets with your wine? I haven't really
595000	597000	been using it to talk. I originally
597000	599000	gave it to my coworker, Jason
599000	601000	unfortunately we had to take it away from him because
601000	603000	all he kept doing throughout
603000	605000	the first game was going, hello
605000	607000	hello
607000	609000	and we're like, listen
609000	611000	okay, you're not going to talk like a rapist
611000	613000	over the god damn
613000	615000	you know, headset, or taking that damn
615000	617000	thing away from you. No, I gave it to
617000	619000	my other coworker, Rob now, and he
619000	621000	uh, he'll usually do a Julia
621000	623000	child impersonation on the
623000	625000	which is pretty fun. First we're going to get
625000	627000	the cake and kill you with it. It's all
627000	629000	Hello, boobies!
629000	631000	Wait, that sounds like Dame Edna
631000	633000	actually. Hello, my
633000	635000	puppets!
635000	637000	Well unto your death!
637000	639000	I didn't say that his, you know,
639000	641000	impersonations were good, but he'll do like
641000	643000	you know, the French Knight
643000	645000	from, you know... Shall I kill you
645000	647000	with my sticky whip?
647000	649000	But there's some pretty funny ones
649000	651000	like, I love playing with the people in the
651000	653000	UK because I love their
653000	655000	accent, and the kids that we play with on there
655000	657000	you know, I'm going to get
657000	659000	the orange, fella! You know, just like
659000	661000	really proper English is hilarious
661000	663000	to me.
663000	665000	By the way, I didn't think
665000	667000	any British impersonation could be
667000	669000	worse than mine, but yours is really
669000	671000	bad. Well, I was doing an
671000	673000	impersonation when he does. I
673000	675000	can't vouch for his impersonation
675000	677000	of anything, but no,
677000	679000	it's just fun.
679000	681000	Really, this is just a temporary thing
681000	683000	until I get my Saints Row
683000	685000	headset. Now, we do know that
685000	687000	the Saints Row Collector's Edition headset is not
687000	689000	compatible through Live
689000	691000	without some adapters
691000	693000	that I can easily find.
693000	695000	So I will have my auto-tuned
695000	697000	voice. They're selling headsets for Saints Row
697000	699000	that you can't use for Live? Yes, it comes
699000	701000	with the Collector's Edition. It's only meant for
701000	703000	PCs and phones.
703000	705000	Okay. It's because it's got a
705000	707000	3.5 millimeter
707000	709000	connection, whereas most of those things are
709000	711000	2.5. They were too cheap to make a deal with Microsoft?
711000	713000	Yes, they were too cheap, so basically
713000	715000	there's a thing that you can get
715000	717000	that splits
717000	719000	a headset
719000	721000	into the, you know,
721000	723000	both the speaker and the microphone
723000	725000	port, and then there's something in the reverse
725000	727000	that goes to 2.5 millimeters, so
727000	729000	I can get
729000	731000	that stuff, and I can make it
731000	733000	work. I've already figured it out.
733000	735000	I've already bookmarked this stuff on Amazon.
735000	737000	It's all a matter of waiting now.
737000	739000	I'm surprised you don't own one
739000	741000	of those little trash talker things
741000	743000	for Xbox. I know SSG100 Matt's been on
743000	745000	the show before talking about those.
745000	747000	They were using, well, we all were playing
747000	749000	Perfect Dark one night with some of the understation
749000	751000	Live people. He was using one of those frickin'
751000	753000	trash talk devices.
753000	755000	I was gonna do one better on that,
755000	757000	as I was actually going to, and I can do this
757000	759000	once I get that actual
759000	761000	device to connect my auto-tune
761000	763000	headset, is
763000	765000	you hook up a splitter to it, and then you hook it up to your
765000	767000	iPod or iPhone or whatever,
767000	769000	and just pull up a soundboard
769000	771000	and tap away.
771000	773000	But yes, the trash talk's pretty awesome.
773000	775000	It's only four. I mean, sometimes you want
775000	777000	Duke Nukem to see a few other things
777000	779000	other than the four preset stuff.
779000	781000	That's right. Four insults
781000	783000	is very limiting. Exactly.
783000	785000	Repeat yourself a little much. Alright.
785000	787000	And pushing buttons on the headset
787000	789000	and stuff to make Duke Nukem
789000	791000	say things. It's funny, but see, the problem is
791000	793000	because I cut the speaker
793000	795000	off, so I can't hear what it's
795000	797000	actually saying, I can't hear myself talk
797000	799000	over everything.
799000	801000	I can only
801000	803000	hear my coworkers saying,
803000	805000	oh yeah, I heard you.
805000	807000	That's the only way.
807000	809000	So, good luck in your trash talking with
809000	811000	the Brits adventure.
811000	813000	Whatever comes of that.
813000	815000	Let's see, my gaming week.
815000	817000	Actually, not a whole lot of new stuff.
817000	819000	I had a very Jamie week. All I really played
819000	821000	was wow, this week.
821000	823000	I did play a few other things
823000	825000	though. There was a few other things I played.
825000	827000	Like, I went back to the fitness game,
827000	829000	and I gave that another go. Remember I razzed that game
829000	831000	on the show last week, the Urself Fitness,
831000	833000	because it didn't have me stretch beforehand.
833000	835000	Well, this time I stretched,
835000	837000	and what do you know? I made it a lot further
837000	839000	in the opening act. I actually made it
839000	841000	through the entire calibration this time,
841000	843000	and didn't feel like
843000	845000	dying the next day. My legs were a little
845000	847000	sore that night, but it wasn't nearly the
847000	849000	pain and suffering I went through the week before.
849000	851000	Like, I'm actually walking today.
851000	853000	It's a miracle. If you really want to see it.
853000	855000	Why don't you come over to my place? Why do I always have to come over here?
855000	857000	You should come pet the kiddies.
857000	859000	I do want to go to your place, but you've never
859000	861000	given me your address, silly Rob.
861000	863000	Well, my address is...
863000	865000	Oh, wait. I can't say it here.
865000	867000	Alright.
867000	869000	One, two, three, any street.
869000	871000	Anytown, USA.
871000	873000	That's right. Anytown, USA.
873000	875000	Actually, true story, I will give you
875000	877000	I will give you a hint
877000	879000	to where I live. I live not far
879000	881000	from a place called Safetyville, USA.
881000	883000	No shit. There's this little
883000	885000	place, and everybody
885000	887000	you see a sign for it on the freeway, and everybody
887000	889000	drives by going, what the fuck is Safetyville, USA?
889000	891000	It's a place where they
891000	893000	take kids in elementary school
893000	895000	and it's one of those tiny
895000	897000	towns where all the buildings are built
897000	899000	at a kid's height or whatever
899000	901000	so that when they're walking through the town, they're little
901000	903000	Godzillas in the town, but it's where they learn about
903000	905000	safety and look both ways
905000	907000	before you cross the street, or the little plastic cars
907000	909000	will get you, you know, things like that.
909000	911000	But it's adorable to drive by and look at
911000	913000	because it's all these tiny, chibi little buildings.
913000	915000	So I don't know why, but Loki talking about
915000	917000	Anytown, USA, maybe think of Safetyville, USA.
917000	919000	It's like that town in hot fuzz.
919000	921000	I guess.
921000	923000	I haven't seen hot fuzz, so I guess.
923000	925000	There's like a miniature of the main village.
925000	927000	Who's there? Yeah.
927000	929000	I don't see like any movies. I was just talking about this the other day.
929000	931000	I didn't see Captain America.
931000	933000	I didn't see Green Lantern.
933000	935000	I didn't see Green Hornet.
935000	937000	Green Lantern was shit anyway.
937000	939000	Well, but you are clearly a Marvel fan girl.
939000	941000	No. DC fans
941000	943000	have said that Green Lantern
943000	945000	I heard it was terrible. I don't know.
945000	947000	Look. Look.
947000	949000	I know some of y'all don't want to hear it,
949000	951000	but I would gladly pay money to look at
951000	953000	Ryan Reynolds for two hours, okay?
953000	955000	But it's actually not him. It's a CG fake body.
955000	957000	Now when Deadpool comes out...
957000	959000	Imagination's all the same. Alright.
959000	961000	Look. That's not what we're here to talk about.
961000	963000	Other games I played this week. I did check out
963000	965000	the demo for one new title. I don't like
965000	967000	doing game reviews based on
967000	969000	a demo, but I will say it was
969000	971000	a great demo, and it did kind of sell me
971000	973000	on the game, and that was Bastion on Xbox
973000	975000	Live, which is a new game that's out
975000	977000	for their Summer of Arcade.
977000	979000	And I did spend a night the other night
979000	981000	just playing through that. It wasn't too
981000	983000	long. It was probably about 30 minutes to maybe
983000	985000	an hour tops. But kind of
985000	987000	the premise of it is it's very much like an
987000	989000	isometric sort of game.
989000	991000	Made me think of... I don't know why when I first
991000	993000	started playing it, my mind went back
993000	995000	to like Solstice
995000	997000	and Equinox, which is not a
997000	999000	bad thing, okay? I don't know if you know these games.
999000	1001000	Solstice was on the Nintendo, and Equinox
1001000	1003000	was a Sony ImagineSoft game.
1003000	1005000	Sony logo on the
1005000	1007000	Super Nintendo. And Equinox
1007000	1009000	is one of my favorite Super Nintendo
1009000	1011000	games they ever made. And a lot of that has to do
1011000	1013000	with the music. But anyway, it's that very isometric
1013000	1015000	kind of dungeon exploring thing.
1015000	1017000	And I used to love those games.
1017000	1019000	And so when I played Bastion
1019000	1021000	it kind of was that same thing. I was like, oh, this is kind of cool.
1021000	1023000	But the art style is very different.
1023000	1025000	The art style reminds me a little more of something like
1025000	1027000	I don't know, Braid or something. But what I thought was really
1027000	1029000	neat about it is that the levels kind of appear
1029000	1031000	as you're walking. Very
1031000	1033000	interesting. And then of course most of all
1033000	1035000	the way the story is told is that
1035000	1037000	there's a narrator in the game
1037000	1039000	who sounds a lot like this.
1039000	1041000	He's kind of a little bit of Isaac
1041000	1043000	Hayes in his voice.
1043000	1045000	And he's narrating the game.
1045000	1047000	And he's talking about that the hero
1047000	1049000	just got up. And so then your character gets
1049000	1051000	up. And like you're walking down and you
1051000	1053000	fall, like let's say you're just clumsy and you fall off the
1053000	1055000	ledge. The hero falls to his
1055000	1057000	death and it's game over. And then
1057000	1059000	he'll fall back from the ceiling. Just
1059000	1061000	kidding. Just like
1061000	1063000	crazy things like that.
1063000	1065000	I'm sure that's the first
1065000	1067000	thing everybody's going to do when they play Bastion
1067000	1069000	is kind of like, oh my god, that
1069000	1071000	narrator has got to stop even though they
1071000	1073000	really enjoy it. So it's
1073000	1075000	cool. Yes,
1075000	1077000	I played through the whole demo and I liked
1077000	1079000	you have different kinds of weapons.
1079000	1081000	You have a hammer and a crossbow.
1081000	1083000	Or you have a bow that you charge
1083000	1085000	like a singular bow.
1085000	1087000	Or I think there was a magic type
1087000	1089000	weapon as well. But you can only really carry
1089000	1091000	three of the four. So you do have to kind of make some
1091000	1093000	decisions. And I just, I don't know, I thought that was
1093000	1095000	kind of neat. Just the whole
1095000	1097000	way it was designed. So I definitely think I will pick up
1097000	1099000	the full version of that. It does seem to
1099000	1101000	be like there's, like I noticed right
1101000	1103000	when I got to the end of the demo in the main
1103000	1105000	world,
1105000	1107000	well not the main world, but like I guess
1107000	1109000	the Bastion square or whatever the central
1109000	1111000	square is that's supposed to be like the hub
1111000	1113000	that I guess the rest of the game takes place through.
1113000	1115000	I noticed that there was a place where I
1115000	1117000	could put a shop
1117000	1119000	of one of two types. I could pick
1119000	1121000	one or the other. So it's kind of
1121000	1123000	like the choice on what you put there will
1123000	1125000	affect your game a little later. Unfortunately
1125000	1127000	the demo doesn't let you kind of fully
1127000	1129000	realize that out. But
1129000	1131000	I'll have to tell you more about that when I pick up
1131000	1133000	the full game. So yeah,
1133000	1135000	I thought that was kind of rad.
1135000	1137000	So going to chat.orangelauntrader.com
1137000	1139000	to see if there's any feedback on the game
1139000	1141000	here. Zether says Bastion
1141000	1143000	needs to be on Steam. I think
1143000	1145000	it was an Ubisoft game. No,
1145000	1147000	Warner Brothers. It's a Warner Brothers game. It might show up on
1147000	1149000	Steam. You never know.
1149000	1151000	Dark Tetsuya is asking, can you do the rest of the
1151000	1153000	show like that? No I can't.
1153000	1155000	But maybe I'll do one of the
1155000	1157000	same. Maybe I'll read an email tonight in that
1157000	1159000	voice. Dark Soccer can pick an email and I'll do it.
1159000	1161000	Okay. Alright. I'm just
1161000	1163000	kidding. I'm not going to do it.
1163000	1165000	Let's see. Stop trying to
1165000	1167000	get out of reading emails.
1167000	1169000	I think that's really it. Otherwise
1169000	1171000	I've just been playing a lot of the other same stuff
1171000	1173000	I've been playing. Like Beat Hazard. I tried
1173000	1175000	to play Survival Mode one night.
1175000	1177000	I didn't get very far. I got through like a song and a half.
1177000	1179000	And just playing some other
1179000	1181000	stuff on Steam. Bit.Trip and some of the other games
1181000	1183000	I've talked about in previous weeks. Bastion's probably the
1183000	1185000	only new thing I've played. I have two games
1185000	1187000	at home sitting for my game rental service
1187000	1189000	waiting to play.
1189000	1191000	And I just haven't gotten around to playing them.
1191000	1193000	And that's Test Drive
1193000	1195000	2 and
1195000	1197000	one of the Need for Speed games. I don't even remember
1197000	1199000	which one. But hopefully
1199000	1201000	I will have a racing-a-thon in the next few
1201000	1203000	days and I can talk about those games on next
1203000	1205000	week's show or something.
1205000	1207000	I'll tell you what else too
1207000	1209000	is something I did this week is I went
1209000	1211000	to the mall because I was just wanting
1211000	1213000	to get out of the house going to the mall. And
1213000	1215000	we realized that we had a gift card that we wanted
1215000	1217000	to spend at GameStop. And
1217000	1219000	I kind of felt a little dirty going to GameStop
1219000	1221000	because I have to tell you guys, I am currently
1221000	1223000	boycotting GameStop. And
1223000	1225000	you know, I'm not going to tell
1225000	1227000	anybody else what to do. And I realized
1227000	1229000	that there are people that might
1229000	1231000	be employees of GameStop and so forth
1231000	1233000	that listen to this show and I want you to know the boycott
1233000	1235000	does not have to do with any
1235000	1237000	type of like store employee.
1237000	1239000	But the management of
1239000	1241000	GameStop is like doing things
1241000	1243000	to a friend of mine right now that
1243000	1245000	I really don't agree with. And we're talking
1245000	1247000	like things of a legal nature
1247000	1249000	that just like disgust me.
1249000	1251000	Like the way this person who worked for this
1251000	1253000	company with so much loyalty for so
1253000	1255000	many years really I think demonstrated
1255000	1257000	and somebody who I think
1257000	1259000	almost in some ways
1259000	1261000	gave up opportunities elsewhere to go
1261000	1263000	work for this company.
1263000	1265000	And just to see the way that they're being
1265000	1267000	treated now by this company
1267000	1269000	because of
1269000	1271000	other situations that happened just
1271000	1273000	it just disgusts me.
1273000	1275000	Like I am disgusted by the actions
1275000	1277000	of GameStop and I can't say too much about
1277000	1279000	what's going on because there's a whole
1279000	1281000	legal element to it. Yeah I know
1281000	1283000	I know but it's just
1283000	1285000	it's just infuriating and I refused
1285000	1287000	to give my dollars to a company
1287000	1289000	that's going to do that to people.
1289000	1291000	Like it's it's gross
1291000	1293000	and it's
1293000	1295000	I don't know I'm not going to support it.
1295000	1297000	Like I'm not going to support
1297000	1299000	this company
1299000	1301000	I don't I don't I don't even know
1301000	1303000	how far I want to go with this. I got to be careful
1303000	1305000	what I say but I'm just I'm just I'm boycotting
1305000	1307000	GameStop. If there are
1307000	1309000	I would encourage you
1309000	1311000	but I'm not going to tell you what to do. And I
1311000	1313000	realize we may have employees that listen to
1313000	1315000	the show and this is no fault
1315000	1317000	of like a store employee or anything like that.
1317000	1319000	Like I realize people have to do
1319000	1321000	what they have to do especially in this economy to make a living
1321000	1323000	but I'm just going to say
1323000	1325000	I hope
1325000	1327000	sometimes I really hope these rumors
1327000	1329000	are true that digital distribution may kill GameStop
1329000	1331000	and that's again no offense
1331000	1333000	to those of you that work in the retail front.
1333000	1335000	I hope you all find other jobs somewhere else
1335000	1337000	very soon. It won't because they bought
1337000	1339000	a digital distribution company. Well
1339000	1341000	that will hopefully fail miserably. That's
1341000	1343000	that's what I hope because the management
1343000	1345000	and the uppers at GameStop clearly
1345000	1347000	are just assholes.
1347000	1349000	I don't have and I have freedom of speech
1349000	1351000	freedom of press granted to me in the
1351000	1353000	U.S. Constitution. I can say in my humble
1353000	1355000	opinion GameStop management is
1355000	1357000	assholes and I am not going to support
1357000	1359000	a company run by assholes.
1359000	1361000	It's as simple as that.
1361000	1363000	I will now step off my soapbox
1363000	1365000	la la la la la. But that was something that came
1365000	1367000	to mind this week. That's actually something that I
1367000	1369000	wanted to address like two weeks ago. But
1369000	1371000	I think it was the same week as our ninth anniversary
1371000	1373000	show so I kind of never got into it. And now
1373000	1375000	I'm not as ranty pants
1375000	1377000	as I probably would have been that week.
1377000	1379000	So but I
1379000	1381000	I'm feeling like I
1381000	1383000	needed to touch on that at some point. If you don't ever
1383000	1385000	hear me talk about that store again now you know why.
1387000	1389000	Let's see. Unless it's bad news about
1389000	1391000	them. Well I
1391000	1393000	I will continue to do my job of
1393000	1395000	reporting on them in
1395000	1397000	the most impartial way I possibly
1397000	1399000	can here on the show.
1399000	1401000	You know whether the news is good or bad
1401000	1403000	we'll continue to report on it so you guys can
1403000	1405000	talk about it. But just don't expect me to be their
1405000	1407000	cheerleader. You know Dan's been like the recipient
1407000	1409000	of like three payouts from
1409000	1411000	class action lawsuits. Really.
1411000	1413000	Yeah. Really. Well
1413000	1415000	I hope...
1415000	1417000	Like a hundred bucks
1417000	1419000	you know nothing major but
1419000	1421000	there's been a number of them
1421000	1423000	and a number still going on.
1423000	1425000	Act Deft in Chat says was it the
1425000	1427000	planking thing? I read about
1427000	1429000	that where the GameStop employees got fired
1429000	1431000	for doing the planking. Believe it
1431000	1433000	or not. Now I can't believe
1433000	1435000	I'm going to say this after my rant. Planking?
1435000	1437000	Have you heard of this? Is that like that Pilates
1437000	1439000	move? Do you remember like in the 50's when people
1439000	1441000	used to sit on flag poles and that's what
1441000	1443000	was cool? Yeah. Ok what's cool now is to
1443000	1445000	put pictures on Twitter of yourself
1445000	1447000	lying dead in the most
1447000	1449000	strange places like in the middle of traffic
1449000	1451000	or what these GameStop employees
1451000	1453000	did. Do a
1453000	1455000	news.google search on
1455000	1457000	GameStop planking and a guy is lying
1457000	1459000	dead between two GameStop
1459000	1461000	displays like a plank. He was laying on
1461000	1463000	top of the displays. Yeah he's lying
1463000	1465000	on top of the displays and I got to
1465000	1467000	admit like even though I just chewed GameStop
1467000	1469000	out there that was
1469000	1471000	a real dumb thing to do is to be in
1471000	1473000	your GameStop uniform and take
1473000	1475000	a picture like that. I mean actually
1475000	1477000	in that case I kind of
1477000	1479000	think I know why GameStop fired. They do have a corporate image
1479000	1481000	I think they're allowed to do that
1481000	1483000	I gotta say. Otherwise
1483000	1485000	they're assholes. It's like the stewardess
1485000	1487000	that put pictures of herself you know on
1487000	1489000	the airplane you know and showing some
1489000	1491000	cleavage. Or the Disney employees at
1491000	1493000	Euro Disney that were all in the costumes and
1493000	1495000	they were doing nasty things backstage
1495000	1497000	like don't put that shit
1497000	1499000	on the internet. Like
1499000	1501000	if you're gonna do it keep it on your phone and
1501000	1503000	laugh at a party or something. Don't put it on the
1503000	1505000	internet. That was the dumb thing they did. Keep in mind
1505000	1507000	my experience with planking has to do with
1507000	1509000	bodies.
1509000	1511000	Oh here we go. Act F. See this is why
1511000	1513000	I love having a live chat because chat will actually
1513000	1515000	link us to these things live.
1515000	1517000	So there you go. I'm gonna bring
1517000	1519000	this up so you can see the picture here
1519000	1521000	Dark Sakura. This is what
1521000	1523000	I can't believe. Oh Spaznator
1523000	1525000	in chat tells me that flagpole sitting was in
1525000	1527000	the 1920s.
1527000	1529000	Actually that was
1529000	1531000	um. I thought it was the 50s.
1531000	1533000	No. Okay then
1533000	1535000	swallowing goldfish or
1535000	1537000	this is actually kind of cool.
1537000	1539000	Why you like that?
1539000	1541000	I think that's ridiculous.
1541000	1543000	Well I mean it is ridiculous but it's kind of
1543000	1545000	neat you know. That's some good
1545000	1547000	abdominal control. And as
1547000	1549000	I've complained about. You are the most
1549000	1551000	unpredictable woman I've ever met. Okay.
1551000	1553000	And that is saying a lot because most women are
1553000	1555000	unpredictable. This is
1555000	1557000	retarded. I'm sorry
1557000	1559000	stupid. I've been
1559000	1561000	told not to say retarded by my wife.
1561000	1563000	You might have been retarded people.
1563000	1565000	Well you should cut back on that
1565000	1567000	quite frankly.
1567000	1569000	It is incredibly
1569000	1571000	stupid. I mean this
1571000	1573000	coning which is the new thing where you
1573000	1575000	You're offending stupid people. Where you go through
1575000	1577000	the drive-thru order an ice cream cone and then
1577000	1579000	you grab the ice cream off the cone.
1579000	1581000	Who cares? I would just think you're
1581000	1583000	stupid. Good job
1583000	1585000	man. Ah you're smart.
1585000	1587000	Wait tell me that. What is coning?
1587000	1589000	You get an ice cream cone
1589000	1591000	and then someone else runs by and takes the ice cream off the cone.
1591000	1593000	No no no no no. Okay.
1593000	1595000	Coning is where you go through the drive-thru
1595000	1597000	of a fast food place
1597000	1599000	you order an ice cream.
1599000	1601000	An ice cream cone that comes on a cone.
1601000	1603000	Instead of like a normal person
1603000	1605000	grabbing it by the cone and enjoying your ice cream
1605000	1607000	you're a dumbass and you
1607000	1609000	grab it by the ice cream.
1609000	1611000	And you shove it in your face.
1611000	1613000	And that is coning. Or
1613000	1615000	yes. This is
1615000	1617000	what. These are the people
1617000	1619000	that will be voters someday.
1619000	1621000	They're not already. Thank you for
1621000	1623000	ruining the world. I thought
1623000	1625000	I thought that was called fire in the hole.
1625000	1627000	That's what people did. And that
1627000	1629000	like actually was not cool because like
1629000	1631000	somebody got burned over that whole thing. But like
1631000	1633000	the fire in the hole is where you go through the drive-thru and you
1633000	1635000	order like the combo meal and then you yell
1635000	1637000	fire in the hole and throw the soda
1637000	1639000	out through the window.
1639000	1641000	But some some asshole
1641000	1643000	did it with coffee and like burned
1643000	1645000	some guy. That is actually not funny.
1645000	1647000	Well of course it always takes stupider
1647000	1649000	people to you know ruin everything.
1649000	1651000	And then there's a new thing called owling.
1651000	1653000	I would demonstrate owling if
1653000	1655000	except I don't know if this chair would hold me.
1655000	1657000	But owling is basically where you
1657000	1659000	kind of squat down on top
1659000	1661000	of something like you're a stupid owl.
1661000	1663000	And you take a picture of it because you know
1663000	1665000	planking wasn't dumb enough.
1665000	1667000	So the people have to
1667000	1669000	come up with even dumber things.
1669000	1671000	I don't know.
1671000	1673000	It's just stupid.
1673000	1675000	The internet makes people
1675000	1677000	stupid.
1677000	1679000	We have proof.
1679000	1681000	So anyway
1681000	1683000	I didn't mean to get
1683000	1685000	you're not supposed to
1685000	1687000	after I do a rant like that on GameStop
1687000	1689000	you're not supposed to give me a news article where I agree
1689000	1691000	with one of their crappy management decisions.
1691000	1693000	They also fired
1693000	1695000	the person that took the picture.
1695000	1697000	I
1697000	1699000	I think it's justified.
1699000	1701000	I hate to say it but like you know
1701000	1703000	you're there to work not to do
1703000	1705000	fucking planking photos. Well I can't make my
1705000	1707000	fellow employee do his job if he wants
1707000	1709000	to go lay down on something.
1709000	1711000	I'm taking the picture to expedite
1711000	1713000	this whole retarded
1713000	1715000	stupid thing that he is doing.
1715000	1717000	Well okay but let me
1717000	1719000	put it this way. Let me put it this way.
1719000	1721000	Let's say those employees
1721000	1723000	leave their position
1723000	1725000	at GameStop and go
1725000	1727000	plank somewhere else.
1727000	1729000	And GameStop threatens to do things to them
1729000	1731000	because they've done things after the fact.
1731000	1733000	That's kind of what's going
1733000	1735000	on in another situation right now and
1735000	1737000	that's why I think it's just
1737000	1739000	icky.
1739000	1741000	So that's all I'm going to say.
1741000	1743000	I feel better.
1743000	1745000	Alright let's move on. Let's talk
1745000	1747000	about well we've done our gaming weeks.
1747000	1749000	How about some housekeeping? You can always find us on

1757000	1759000	Let's move on
1759000	1761000	and talk about some news
1761000	1763000	and what's going on in the gaming industry this week.
1763000	1765000	Let's see what else Pizzas' offer makes us happy.
1765000	1767000	Oh I can't wait to see where we're going to
1767000	1769000	start tonight. What is
1769000	1771000	the internet talking about tonight?
1771000	1773000	Let's talk about a wonderful
1773000	1775000	wonderful game that was
1775000	1777000	highly anticipated. Made by
1777000	1779000	Capcom.
1779000	1781000	Long awaited sequel to
1781000	1783000	Mega Man Legends. Mega Man Legends 3
1783000	1785000	this project that they were also kind of
1785000	1787000	getting input from the fans
1787000	1789000	themselves to help them
1789000	1791000	create this game.
1791000	1793000	They said you know what?
1793000	1795000	We're not going to put it up.
1795000	1797000	Originally they were
1797000	1799000	going to have
1799000	1801000	this prototype version that was going to
1801000	1803000	hit the eShop
1803000	1805000	and you're going to be able to download it.
1805000	1807000	Then they started doing this crap like
1807000	1809000	well not a lot of people download
1809000	1811000	this game. We're not going to make it.
1811000	1813000	Now they're like well there's not
1813000	1815000	enough systems that sold so
1815000	1817000	we're not going to make it.
1817000	1819000	Basically the actual
1819000	1821000	quote
1821000	1823000	unfortunately it was
1823000	1825000	not felt that the Mega Man
1825000	1827000	Legends 3 project met the
1827000	1829000	required criteria to go into
1829000	1831000	full productions and thus it was
1831000	1833000	pulled.
1835000	1837000	Apparently they're saying there's
1837000	1839000	a fan campaign going on
1839000	1841000	now to get people to
1841000	1843000	put this game out. I have a few
1843000	1845000	problems with this. One, not to
1845000	1847000	be rude but that fan campaign will be about as
1847000	1849000	effective as the mother fan campaign.
1849000	1851000	Sorry. Number
1851000	1853000	one, who told
1853000	1855000	Capcom to fucking put it on 3DS
1855000	1857000	anyways? I mean that's risky.
1857000	1859000	You're kind of assuming well it's a Nintendo
1859000	1861000	system. It's going to sell incredibly well.
1861000	1863000	What happens if it doesn't?
1863000	1865000	They're like what do you mean what happens if it doesn't?
1865000	1867000	It's a Nintendo system. It's going to sell incredibly well.
1867000	1869000	I mean that's kind of
1869000	1871000	their logic there. Then when it didn't they're like
1871000	1873000	crap.
1873000	1875000	Um
1875000	1877000	but I don't understand
1877000	1879000	why they just don't put it out on
1879000	1881000	our system. I mean god it can't be that
1881000	1883000	hard to port a Playstation
1883000	1885000	1 looking game onto
1885000	1887000	another
1887000	1889000	system like Xbox Live Arcade,
1889000	1891000	Playstation Network, WiiWare. Now you've
1891000	1893000	always been quite the fan of Mega Man Legends
1893000	1895000	haven't you? Because I remember
1895000	1897000	earlier episodes of this show and I mean like
1897000	1899000	early in the first few years of the show where you were talking about
1899000	1901000	how much you love those games and you always wish they
1901000	1903000	make a third one. So now here it is
1903000	1905000	Capcom's going to make a third one and then oh well
1905000	1907000	you know what actually. And it was one of the reasons
1907000	1909000	I got a 3DS.
1909000	1911000	Granted not one of the top reasons I got
1911000	1913000	a 3DS.
1913000	1915000	But at this point it'll take any reason to get
1915000	1917000	you know to justify
1917000	1919000	getting a 3DS because there's not many reasons
1919000	1921000	out there. But it's one of the things
1921000	1923000	it's seriously stupid because
1923000	1925000	this is one of the games oh yeah we're
1925000	1927000	the fans wanted this and we're going to
1927000	1929000	take all this fan support. Then they're like well
1929000	1931000	we didn't get a lot of support on this so
1931000	1933000	uh you know
1933000	1935000	So they're going to give they're going to abort
1935000	1937000	they're going to have a live abortion of Mega
1937000	1939000	Man and make all their fans watch. Yeah I love it.
1939000	1941000	We didn't get enough support on the forums
1941000	1943000	for this you know
1943000	1945000	voting processing.
1945000	1947000	I'm sorry but
1947000	1949000	you're the fucking game
1949000	1951000	developer why do you need people to
1951000	1953000	input on the game? Well we didn't get
1953000	1955000	enough input on the game so we don't know
1955000	1957000	what to do. Well what do you do in the situation
1957000	1959000	where you don't ask the fans what they
1959000	1961000	want you just I don't know
1961000	1963000	create the develop if you
1963000	1965000	will the game. The
1965000	1967000	crowdsourcing was not up to our expectation
1967000	1969000	so we fired all the employees
1969000	1971000	you. It was stupid
1971000	1973000	it's it's just Capcom
1973000	1975000	being Capcom now I'm sorry
1975000	1977000	but Capcom's kind of
1977000	1979000	I don't know what they're doing. I
1979000	1981000	think some people higher up are making
1981000	1983000	really dumb decisions.
1983000	1985000	Okay so let's go to comments from our chat
1985000	1987000	chat.org.com. Breakman says
1987000	1989000	I think Legends 3 was cancelled because they wanted
1989000	1991000	to shove it in Inafune's face.
1991000	1993000	Well the
1993000	1995000	creator of Mega Man left some time ago. Well that's
1995000	1997000	that's awesome yeah let's shove it in his
1997000	1999000	face that's
1999000	2001000	yeah that'll show the fans.
2001000	2003000	I
2003000	2005000	I don't see the point.
2005000	2007000	Do you think there could be legit you know to play
2007000	2009000	Devil's Advocate here a little bit could there be legitimate
2009000	2011000	concern on Capcom's part
2011000	2013000	that there just wouldn't be money to be made off
2013000	2015000	of this game. That maybe they're going to go through
2015000	2017000	all the trouble of developing it and the fact
2017000	2019000	that the 3DS has not quite
2019000	2021000	sold millions and millions right now
2021000	2023000	and the fact that you know
2023000	2025000	Mega Man's Legends is a title
2025000	2027000	that's many years old maybe it really
2027000	2029000	wasn't destined to sell that many copies.
2029000	2031000	So therefore it's not worth doing.
2031000	2033000	They've done more retarded
2033000	2035000	things like they put out
2035000	2037000	was it the Mega Man powered up Mega Man game
2037000	2039000	on the PSP and
2039000	2041000	the Mega Man I think there's a Mega Man
2041000	2043000	X kind of remake thing
2043000	2045000	on the PSP as well
2045000	2047000	that I mean the PSP it
2047000	2049000	didn't have that many people that bought it
2049000	2051000	and in a game like that especially
2051000	2053000	where it's just a remake of the first Mega Man
2053000	2055000	game not a lot of people really cared
2055000	2057000	about that even though it was kind of cool they had a level
2057000	2059000	editor and stuff like that it just didn't
2059000	2061000	really strike me as
2061000	2063000	something big like
2063000	2065000	a sequel to
2065000	2067000	a really cool franchise
2067000	2069000	that people have been clamoring to get
2069000	2071000	more of and obviously you know people
2071000	2073000	love the characters because I mean you have
2073000	2075000	Tron Bon and
2075000	2077000	Marvel vs. Capcom 3
2077000	2079000	and 2 and you know
2079000	2081000	there's cameos from the
2081000	2083000	Servbot characters are everywhere
2083000	2085000	like you know and Dead Rising
2085000	2087000	and all that stuff and people love
2087000	2089000	Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and Tatsunoko
2089000	2091000	vs. Capcom I mean
2091000	2093000	they're definitely around there it's just
2093000	2095000	I don't know
2095000	2097000	it's just kind of stupid
2097000	2099000	there's some games you just put out to make
2099000	2101000	the fans happy and granted you're not going to make
2101000	2103000	a lot of money on it but
2103000	2105000	I'm sorry but when you're
2105000	2107000	not really marketing this game
2107000	2109000	you're not really
2109000	2111000	needing the talent
2111000	2113000	to come up with all this stuff since you're
2113000	2115000	having fans kind of create everything
2115000	2117000	for you I don't
2117000	2119000	understand why
2119000	2121000	why you would even have
2121000	2123000	a big budget for this let me go to the
2123000	2125000	chatroom and read some comments there's an
2125000	2127000	interesting perspective here we have GameGuru in our
2127000	2129000	chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com says
2129000	2131000	the problem with porting a game like
2131000	2133000	Mega Man Legends 3 to Xbox Live and PSN
2133000	2135000	vs. the 3DS is because
2135000	2137000	Capcom could sell it for $40 on a
2137000	2139000	physical medium vs. $15
2139000	2141000	on a digital only medium
2141000	2143000	TheRobD in our chatroom says reasons
2143000	2145000	why Capcom probably cancelled Mega Man Legends
2145000	2147000	3 not many people like
2147000	2149000	Mega Man Legends 1 and 2
2149000	2151000	Inafune left 3DS didn't sell
2151000	2153000	well lack of fan demand
2153000	2155000	pick any of those reasons all of them are valid
2155000	2157000	that said with the fan support they were
2157000	2159000	asking for they should have released the game
2159000	2161000	who said that they couldn't put it on a physical medium
2161000	2163000	I mean they could have easily done that
2163000	2165000	and put it out as a disc sell it for $40
2165000	2167000	I mean people would have eaten it up
2167000	2169000	oh yeah especially if they'd released it like
2169000	2171000	as a budget title quote unquote where it was like
2171000	2173000	$29.99 or it would have sold like crazy
2173000	2175000	I think and you could do
2175000	2177000	download content later on because everyone's
2177000	2179000	about download content but
2179000	2181000	Capcom just doesn't get it and I
2181000	2183000	mean I know we're going to be talking about
2183000	2185000	some other stuff from Capcom but
2185000	2187000	let's look at what they're doing I mean
2187000	2189000	here's their good ideas that they
2189000	2191000	have coming out there's some
2191000	2193000	new IPs from them so I'm
2193000	2195000	not really commenting on those but
2195000	2197000	the stuff that's existing
2197000	2199000	like there's a Dead Rising 2
2199000	2201000	off the record it was basically
2201000	2203000	Dead Rising 2 the way we should have done it in the first place
2203000	2205000	because the last one didn't sell very well
2205000	2207000	I mean that's kind of dumb
2207000	2209000	and then you have
2209000	2211000	Ultimate Marvel
2211000	2213000	versus Capcom 3
2213000	2215000	it's like well
2215000	2217000	we were going to offer
2217000	2219000	download content for the first game
2219000	2221000	and we charged a buttload for a couple of them
2221000	2223000	and then we said
2223000	2225000	fuck you you buy a disc now
2225000	2227000	so
2227000	2229000	and then
2229000	2231000	all the stuff that they're doing on the
2231000	2233000	IOS marketplace their crappy
2233000	2235000	DRM I mean there's just a lot
2235000	2237000	of really bad decisions
2237000	2239000	and we see this similar
2239000	2241000	type of trend with other companies I mean
2241000	2243000	Activision for example
2243000	2245000	um
2245000	2247000	they just kind of have to have a reality
2247000	2249000	check for a little bit oh and let's not
2249000	2251000	forget to mention Devil May Cry
2251000	2253000	how they're rebooting that franchise
2253000	2255000	and just I don't
2255000	2257000	even know what they're doing to Dante it's just ridiculous
2257000	2259000	could it maybe be that
2259000	2261000	it's not so much the news that they've
2261000	2263000	cancelled the project but it was kind of the way
2263000	2265000	they delivered the news like
2265000	2267000	part of me thinks especially seeing in our chat
2267000	2269000	room that there are some people that are kind of sympathetic
2269000	2271000	to why Capcom cancelled Mega Man Universe
2271000	2273000	Mega Man Legends 3
2273000	2275000	actually there's another comment on Mega Man Universe
2275000	2277000	don't forget that project was cancelled too
2277000	2279000	I'll come back to that in a minute
2279000	2281000	but see that's the point could it be
2281000	2283000	the way they handled it like you know
2283000	2285000	Netflix took a lot of crap a couple weeks ago
2285000	2287000	for the way they handled the news
2287000	2289000	about the price increase to Netflix service
2289000	2291000	could maybe Capcom have handled this
2291000	2293000	a little better
2293000	2295000	well I mean
2295000	2297000	they could have done a few
2297000	2299000	other things like saying well you know what
2299000	2301000	we're going to explore
2301000	2303000	other options with putting this game out
2303000	2305000	the only thing that kind of
2305000	2307000	rubs me the wrong way about this
2307000	2309000	news was the whole remember they were supposed
2309000	2311000	to release a prototype version
2311000	2313000	that was going to be like a downloadable
2313000	2315000	demo and gauging the reaction of
2315000	2317000	that would be if they would release the full game or not
2317000	2319000	but we never even got the prototype
2319000	2321000	that strikes me as odd
2321000	2323000	like that they talked about this whole
2323000	2325000	well you better buy the prototype if you want the game
2325000	2327000	essentially is what they're saying without saying it
2327000	2329000	and now they've just canned the whole
2329000	2331000	thing they're not even going to let the prototype come out
2331000	2333000	that strikes me as very
2333000	2335000	like just
2335000	2337000	I don't know like at least get the
2337000	2339000	prototype version out and see what happens
2339000	2341000	it was probably I'm guessing
2341000	2343000	some sort of licensing thing maybe with
2343000	2345000	Inafune maybe it's just
2345000	2347000	maybe that's why
2347000	2349000	Mega Man's not in Marvel vs. Capcom
2349000	2351000	you know 3 or the new Marvel vs. Capcom
2351000	2353000	3 update
2353000	2355000	or whatever or
2355000	2357000	I don't know
2357000	2359000	I really
2359000	2361000	when I heard it was cancelled I was like ehhhh
2361000	2363000	whatever
2363000	2365000	I wasn't that
2365000	2367000	I thought it was cool but I wasn't
2367000	2369000	super psyched I mean it would have been nice to have a
2369000	2371000	game that I was kind of looking forward to on
2371000	2373000	the 3DS but I've just kind of come to
2373000	2375000	accept that the stuff on the 3DS
2375000	2377000	there's just a lot of the stuff I was looking
2377000	2379000	forward to and
2379000	2381000	trust me there's been already 3 games
2381000	2383000	cancelled on the 3DS including
2383000	2385000	Mega Man Legends 3 that I was
2385000	2387000	looking forward to for the 3DS
2387000	2389000	Saints Row on the 3DS and
2389000	2391000	DJ Hero on the 3DS all of those
2391000	2393000	well DJ Hero is not surprising though considering what
2393000	2395000	went on over there I understand that but these were all
2395000	2397000	games you know that kind of sold me
2397000	2399000	on a 3DS other than you know
2401000	2403000	Kid Icarus looks pretty awesome
2403000	2405000	I think Nintendo is going to recover a little bit
2405000	2407000	come Christmas time though and I think some of these
2407000	2409000	companies might regret it you know
2409000	2411000	I don't know but we'll see I want to read some other comments
2411000	2413000	in chat because some of these are really good here
2413000	2415000	Sj100 Matt in our chat room says
2415000	2417000	it's all a front since Kiji Inafune
2417000	2419000	creator of Mega Man left Capcom
2419000	2421000	they started cancelling Mega Man projects
2421000	2423000	first Mega Man Universe which was a lot of fun
2423000	2425000	when I played it at New York Comic Con
2425000	2427000	Mega Man Legends 3 and the lack of Mega Man
2427000	2429000	and Marvel vs. Capcom 3
2429000	2431000	Capcom obviously doesn't want Inafune's image
2431000	2433000	as a part of them anymore
2433000	2435000	well you can't say Mega Man
2435000	2437000	Universe was
2437000	2439000	or the Mega Man Universe was completely omitted
2439000	2441000	because Tronbon's a character and Servbots
2441000	2443000	show up there but I also
2443000	2445000	I do I will admit I had a similar train of thought
2445000	2447000	is that this whole stuff had me thinking
2447000	2449000	as I thought about well gee they cancelled Mega Man
2449000	2451000	Universe 2 and now they cancel this and I thought
2451000	2453000	how come we never got a Mega Man
2453000	2455000	11 like didn't Mega Man
2455000	2457000	9 obviously did crazy good
2457000	2459000	Mega Man 10 I think did alright but I think
2459000	2461000	a lot of people were just like okay
2461000	2463000	you know jokes jokes getting old now but like
2463000	2465000	I'm a little worried like does this mean Mega Man
2465000	2467000	at all is
2467000	2469000	done for now I mean I realize the creators left
2469000	2471000	Capcom so that's a very distinct possibility
2471000	2473000	but it's a big deal we had Katamari games with other creators
2473000	2475000	being there I mean it's
2475000	2477000	none of them really were as good as the original
2477000	2479000	well that's because they didn't try
2479000	2481000	but you know the whole point is
2481000	2483000	is it that they can't make any of these games
2483000	2485000	or they're just not I mean cause
2485000	2487000	if they're not I don't understand
2487000	2489000	I mean get over your guy themselves
2489000	2491000	you know if you're just like well we don't want his
2491000	2493000	character you know he left us
2493000	2495000	we left us
2495000	2497000	so sad I mean get over
2497000	2499000	yourself Mega Man's an iconic
2499000	2501000	character I would think I would be challenged to make
2501000	2503000	the best Mega Man game we've ever made
2503000	2505000	if you really if you really
2505000	2507000	want to get at him make
2507000	2509000	the best Mega Man game that anyone's ever seen
2509000	2511000	we don't need you anymore
2511000	2513000	I mean but
2513000	2515000	but they did they do need him
2515000	2517000	that's essentially what they're admitting
2517000	2519000	right?
2519000	2521000	I guess
2521000	2523000	alright
2523000	2525000	let's move on with some more gaming news
2525000	2527000	I suppose of course you can always join our chat room
2527000	2529000	chat.orangelaungeradio.com
2529000	2531000	where a lot of folks
2531000	2533000	kind of going back and forth on this talking a little bit about
2533000	2535000	the Twitter and how the announcement
2535000	2537000	was handled there on Twitter I did not see this
2537000	2539000	but I guess it was pretty harsh on the Europe
2539000	2541000	Twitter anyway
2541000	2543000	yikes
2543000	2545000	so more gaming news here this is a rumor
2545000	2547000	that's been confirmed to be true
2547000	2549000	and it has to do with
2549000	2551000	Goldeneye Reloaded remember this
2551000	2553000	we saw a listing for this on Amazon.com
2553000	2555000	a couple weeks ago and it turns out
2555000	2557000	it is true the Goldeneye remake
2557000	2559000	is coming out on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation
2559000	2561000	3 some screenshots were released
2561000	2563000	earlier this week
2563000	2565000	it is interesting because
2565000	2567000	the game press release
2567000	2569000	didn't even mention the Nintendo 64
2569000	2571000	original or last year's
2571000	2573000	Wii game interesting
2573000	2575000	but nevertheless the game is coming out
2575000	2577000	Daniel Craig is still playing
2577000	2579000	Bond not Pierce Brosnan
2579000	2581000	Activision says that the game will
2581000	2583000	run at 60 frames a second it will
2583000	2585000	support the PlayStation Move sharp shooter
2585000	2587000	gun controller interesting
2587000	2589000	so
2589000	2591000	there you go it's also going to support 16
2591000	2593000	players online the Wii version only
2593000	2595000	supported 8 they're saying more maps
2595000	2597000	weapons characters and game modes
2597000	2599000	interesting
2599000	2601000	so what do you guys think is this a game that interests you guys
2601000	2603000	I passed on the Wii version
2603000	2605000	but I did play it at E3 and I thought it was okay
2605000	2607000	it's just my Wii kind of collects dust now
2607000	2609000	if they release this at the right price
2609000	2611000	I think I'd be interested
2611000	2613000	but I just have a bad feeling it's
2613000	2615000	going to be a $60 title and I just think there'll be
2615000	2617000	too much other stuff this holiday I'm more
2617000	2619000	interested in I concur that's
2619000	2621000	really I think what our issue with that would be
2621000	2623000	yeah it's going to be really be the price that this
2623000	2625000	comes out and I'm not
2625000	2627000	seeing your price here on the list so I guess
2627000	2629000	we just have to assume it's probably going to be full price
2629000	2631000	most likely
2631000	2633000	just hopefully they're smart enough
2633000	2635000	not to release it like a week before
2635000	2637000	Modern Warfare 3 comes out
2637000	2639000	like the last
2639000	2641000	Bond game release dates
2641000	2643000	are really crucial in gaming I think
2643000	2645000	that's something we're kind of coming to learn over the past
2645000	2647000	couple years I mean come on
2647000	2649000	Activision get your shit together
2649000	2651000	you know that you have Modern Warfare 3
2651000	2653000	coming out the week after you may
2653000	2655000	think huh you know if we put this game
2655000	2657000	out a week before we're only going to get
2657000	2659000	maybe one week of sales because everyone's
2659000	2661000	going to go oh my god you know
2661000	2663000	Modern Warfare 3 who gives a shit about
2663000	2665000	buying this
2665000	2667000	honestly this is a game this Goldeneye
2667000	2669000	Reloaded is a game that should be out now
2669000	2671000	like it should have come out now because
2671000	2673000	what do we have right now nothing
2673000	2675000	right now nothing I mean
2675000	2677000	yes I realize they want to you know get
2677000	2679000	a lot of the Christmas sales and so forth
2679000	2681000	but at the same time you got to be real
2681000	2683000	you either look at why the one on the Wii didn't do
2683000	2685000	you can't put that out this holiday
2685000	2687000	because you've got you know let's
2687000	2689000	let's start with the September
2689000	2691000	you've got Gears 3 and Resistance 3 coming
2691000	2693000	out you've got the
2693000	2695000	following month Battlefield 3 coming out
2695000	2697000	and then you have Modern Warfare 3
2697000	2699000	it's just going to get lost
2699000	2701000	you need to
2701000	2703000	you know you need to really put that out either in August
2703000	2705000	or you're going to have to wait until
2705000	2707000	winter don't worry about
2707000	2709000	getting it out for holiday because
2709000	2711000	or put it out in December
2711000	2713000	because there's nothing in December
2713000	2715000	nothing
2715000	2717000	DungeonBuster in our chatroom
2717000	2719000	at chat.orangehonestgrady.com says
2719000	2721000	I already played the Wii version no need to play it again
2721000	2723000	but 16 players
2723000	2725000	online and new characters and new maps
2725000	2727000	and HD OMG
2727000	2729000	sign me up
2729000	2731000	it would be really hard to ask somebody to pay
2731000	2733000	60 bucks twice though because you know the Wii version
2733000	2735000	or excuse me the Wii was probably only about 50 bucks
2735000	2737000	but at this one's full price it'll be 60 bucks
2737000	2739000	it's going to be hard to ask somebody to pay
2739000	2741000	that twice especially for what
2741000	2743000	was essentially a remake of an old game
2743000	2745000	I'd rather see an HD remake of
2745000	2747000	TimeSplitters 2
2747000	2749000	and why that game?
2749000	2751000	that game is awesome
2751000	2753000	even TimeSplitters Future Perfect would be awesome
2753000	2755000	it was such a great shooter
2755000	2757000	alright
2757000	2759000	well let's move on with some more news
2759000	2761000	Dark Soccer what do you have for us tonight?
2761000	2763000	well we have some news about
2763000	2765000	Google Plus actually
2765000	2767000	they have
2767000	2769000	they're going to be getting some gaming features
2769000	2771000	soon it's actually on the help page
2771000	2773000	according to
2773000	2775000	a few sources they say
2775000	2777000	that they're going to do something called
2777000	2779000	game stream where you can check
2779000	2781000	for updates on the games that you're playing
2781000	2783000	and
2783000	2785000	actually when it was on there
2785000	2787000	the link to it now is a 404
2787000	2789000	oh
2789000	2791000	so
2791000	2793000	but it said that there are
2793000	2795000	something is in the source code
2795000	2797000	that are games get game friends
2797000	2799000	games get activities and games post
2799000	2801000	to stream so
2801000	2803000	hmm
2803000	2805000	well I mean this isn't
2805000	2807000	I mean this is kind of a duh
2807000	2809000	especially if you think about that we had
2809000	2811000	news before that Google had invested
2811000	2813000	in Zynga a couple months ago
2813000	2815000	actually maybe more like six months ago
2815000	2817000	they'd invested what like a hundred million dollars
2817000	2819000	in Zynga so
2819000	2821000	I mean the fact that games are going to
2821000	2823000	come to Google is a bit of a duh
2823000	2825000	but you know a it's about how
2825000	2827000	soon and I think the question that really has
2827000	2829000	everyone wondering is how
2829000	2831000	are they going to implement it because this could
2831000	2833000	really make or break Google plus
2833000	2835000	a lot of the a lot of folks are really
2835000	2837000	excited about Google plus right now why
2837000	2839000	because it's not Facebook and
2839000	2841000	what Google plus is doing right is that
2841000	2843000	they're giving people a lot of what
2843000	2845000	Facebook has been very slow
2845000	2847000	or very stubborn to give and that is
2847000	2849000	a decent mobile
2849000	2851000	app for starters
2851000	2853000	once
2853000	2855000	Apple finally approved it
2855000	2857000	let's see they have given folks the
2857000	2859000	control total control over well I shouldn't
2859000	2861000	say total because there's some things about
2861000	2863000	the privacy they even frustrate me too in the pictures
2863000	2865000	department but like you have to have
2865000	2867000	a public profile to keep your account
2867000	2869000	as of the end of the month
2869000	2871000	oh really yes actually as of the
2871000	2873000	27th interesting I posted that on
2873000	2875000	Google plus oh I missed it but
2875000	2877000	yeah they said if you're you're in a circle
2877000	2879000	with people I don't read their stuff I'm kidding
2879000	2881000	I just missed it it can be
2881000	2883000	as little as just your name yeah
2883000	2885000	but you have to have a public profile
2885000	2887000	I think I well I thought you
2887000	2889000	just kind of had one by default it's kind of like
2889000	2891000	Facebook you
2891000	2893000	have a profile but as long
2893000	2895000	as you know
2895000	2897000	you lock everything down nobody sees
2897000	2899000	anything but your name and your default picture
2899000	2901000	which doesn't have to be you yeah I think
2901000	2903000	that's it but I mean but they're saying that for people
2903000	2905000	who have them fully private then
2905000	2907000	their Google plus accounts are getting wiped
2907000	2909000	no they wouldn't
2909000	2911000	wipe that's what it says well wouldn't you just
2911000	2913000	change it from private or something that seems
2913000	2915000	a little ridiculous hold a second I will get it
2915000	2917000	for you alright yeah share the story because I'm curious about
2917000	2919000	that so then Google might damn
2919000	2921000	themselves on all these you know hey we're gonna
2921000	2923000	do privacy right and then oh
2923000	2925000	well we're not that seems a little
2925000	2927000	bit ridiculous to me I don't know here it is
2927000	2929000	it says
2929000	2931000	and this is
2931000	2933000	under the Google plus project
2933000	2935000	area
2935000	2937000	public profiles the purpose of Google
2937000	2939000	profiles is to enable you to manage
2939000	2941000	your online identity today nearly all
2941000	2943000	Google profiles are public we believe
2943000	2945000	that using Google profiles to help people
2945000	2947000	find and connect with you online is how the product
2947000	2949000	is best used private profiles
2949000	2951000	don't allow for this we have decided to require
2951000	2953000	our what require all profiles to be
2953000	2955000	public keep in mind that your
2955000	2957000	full name is the only required information
2957000	2959000	that will just be displayed in your profile
2959000	2961000	you'll be able to edit or remove any other information
2961000	2963000	you don't want to share if you currently
2963000	2965000	have a private profile but you do not wish to
2965000	2967000	make your profile public you can delete
2967000	2969000	your profile or you can simply do nothing all
2969000	2971000	private profiles will be deleted after July 31st
2971000	2973000	2011 that doesn't seem any
2973000	2975000	worse than what Facebook does I mean
2975000	2977000	because yeah okay so you can have
2977000	2979000	your name and a picture of your cat
2981000	2983000	I mean that's that doesn't seem
2983000	2985000	so terrible to me
2985000	2987000	but there are people that are getting
2987000	2989000	kinda well
2989000	2991000	because it's a step
2991000	2993000	backwards for Google I think a little
2993000	2995000	bit in the privacy area where everybody's
2995000	2997000	been really I think I think it
2997000	2999000	kinda feels a little bit like a slap
2999000	3001000	or a step back when everybody's been very
3001000	3003000	rah rah rah circles are the right thing
3003000	3005000	to do circles are amazing it's
3005000	3007000	the whole reason why Google Plus works
3007000	3009000	circles are this year's squares
3009000	3011000	yes circles are this year's squares
3011000	3013000	exactly so as far as
3013000	3015000	going back to the games implementation though
3015000	3017000	I think a lot of people are nervous about how are they gonna
3017000	3019000	implement games because one reason that people
3019000	3021000	hate Facebook is that they hate
3021000	3023000	the so and so is growing
3023000	3025000	bullshit on their farm why don't you come
3025000	3027000	farm with them and all the
3027000	3029000	invites one thing and also on
3029000	3031000	Facebook they have at least didn't do hide
3031000	3033000	all posts by yeah and Facebook
3033000	3035000	I will say a lot of that got better
3035000	3037000	but it took a long time for that to happen
3037000	3039000	and so the question is how's Google gonna
3039000	3041000	implement it especially if they have a stake in Zynga
3041000	3043000	now based off of the stuff that's leaked
3043000	3045000	out it sounds like a
3045000	3047000	game play stream will be
3047000	3049000	a totally separate thing that
3049000	3051000	you would have to click on to view
3051000	3053000	just the game post and I think that's
3053000	3055000	a great way to do it that way
3055000	3057000	it keeps it out of my main feed where people are
3057000	3059000	posting cute pictures of their cat and
3059000	3061000	status updates and it just puts it in
3061000	3063000	a place where if I feel like playing a game
3063000	3065000	then I'll click on that stream and see what's
3065000	3067000	going on but I don't always
3067000	3069000	believe it or not I don't always feel like playing a game
3069000	3071000	when I go online
3071000	3073000	and believe it or not I don't always care what other people are playing
3073000	3075000	yeah exactly especially
3075000	3077000	my mother in Farmville
3077000	3079000	believe it or not everybody that sends me an invite for a game
3079000	3081000	I deny it
3081000	3083000	oh and all those people, I wish that
3083000	3085000	this is one thing I wish Facebook had
3085000	3087000	to have an option where
3087000	3089000	send everyone who sends you an
3089000	3091000	invite a message saying knock it off
3091000	3093000	and
3093000	3095000	another interesting comment from BlackWolf
3095000	3097000	in our chatroom and this is something I have thought
3097000	3099000	about before so I guess I'll address it now
3099000	3101000	BlackWolf says Skye one other thing to realize
3101000	3103000	is that they insist on you using your real
3103000	3105000	name if you use a pseudonym
3105000	3107000	i.e. you and me we are at risk of
3107000	3109000	being suspended from Google Plus
3109000	3111000	and to get unsuspended you would need to send them a photocopy
3111000	3113000	of your government issued ID
3113000	3115000	well here's the thing I think most of the reason
3115000	3117000	why they're doing that is they're trying to keep the
3117000	3119000	businesses out of profiles right now
3119000	3121000	and that you know my name on there isn't
3121000	3123000	fuck you you know like if my name
3123000	3125000	was Rob fuck you I think they might have
3125000	3127000	a problem with that I think the way
3127000	3129000	I'm doing it on there and the way you're doing it on there
3129000	3131000	we're kind of okay because we're just
3131000	3133000	you know we're people that are just trying to protect our
3133000	3135000	privacy because I think you know
3135000	3137000	podcasters can be in a very unique situation
3137000	3139000	sometimes and I've talked about
3139000	3141000	violations that have happened to my privacy before
3141000	3143000	and how alarming that can be I don't
3143000	3145000	want to get into that whole spiel before but it's scary
3145000	3147000	until you've been there so here's my thing
3147000	3149000	if Google Plus cancels my account fine I'll
3149000	3151000	stop using it I'm not going to sign
3151000	3153000	up under my real name period but my life
3153000	3155000	will go on without a Google Plus
3155000	3157000	I won't talk about it on this show
3157000	3159000	I'll make my friends go to another website
3159000	3161000	if they want to see my pictures and give another company
3161000	3163000	the ad dollars or what have you
3163000	3165000	like I am not required
3165000	3167000	to use this website I think
3167000	3169000	it's pretty cool and I'd like to keep
3169000	3171000	using it but there's just
3171000	3173000	some things I'm not going to bend on
3173000	3175000	you know and if they're and what
3175000	3177000	would infuriate me is if
3177000	3179000	Lady Gaga gets a profile on Google Plus
3179000	3181000	that will infuriate me if
3181000	3183000	Lady Gaga gets to have a profile
3183000	3185000	and I would get mine removed
3185000	3187000	because I have to use a fake last name to
3187000	3189000	protect myself from stalkers
3189000	3191000	then that would piss me off
3191000	3193000	because that's a double standard
3193000	3195000	how come Lady Gaga gets to have a Google Plus
3195000	3197000	profile and not Stephanie Germanotta
3197000	3199000	that would piss me off
3199000	3201000	absolutely it would piss me off or any other
3201000	3203000	celebrity that doesn't go by their real name which is
3203000	3205000	most of them
3205000	3207000	Cher's name isn't Cher you guys
3207000	3209000	Madonna's name actually I think
3209000	3211000	Katy Perry isn't even Katy Perry
3211000	3213000	Katy Perry is not Katy Perry look at actors
3213000	3215000	like David Tennant couldn't register
3215000	3217000	under his real name because
3217000	3219000	there was another actor with that name registered with
3219000	3221000	the Actors Guild in the
3221000	3223000	UK the greatest
3223000	3225000	rock star singer of all fucking
3225000	3227000	time no
3227000	3229000	Freddie Mercury was not his real
3229000	3231000	name either well Ringo Starr wasn't his name
3231000	3233000	but he had illegally changed so
3233000	3235000	there you go
3235000	3237000	I like how someone in chat changed their name
3237000	3239000	to Rob Fuck You
3239000	3241000	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom
3241000	3243000	at chat.org.com says
3243000	3245000	Rob Fuck You from fucking Austria
3245000	3247000	you know what I would
3247000	3249000	like is if you
3249000	3251000	have to register under your real name but you
3251000	3253000	can choose a pseudonym
3253000	3255000	but it has to track that that would be great
3255000	3257000	that would be great
3257000	3259000	and Rama in chat says Skye but what if she
3259000	3261000	legally changes her name to Lady Gaga
3261000	3263000	she hasn't
3263000	3265000	she hasn't and you know if you watch interviews
3265000	3267000	with her which I wouldn't expect that all the listeners
3267000	3269000	of this show have watched Gaga
3269000	3271000	interviews but me being a little screaming fanboy
3271000	3273000	of Gaga I have watched interviews and she
3273000	3275000	she claims and I believe it
3275000	3277000	I don't see why not that there really is no difference
3277000	3279000	between her and Stephanie it's just kind of
3279000	3281000	who she that's the name that people
3281000	3283000	know her by which funny enough is kind of
3283000	3285000	what Rob Roberts has become for me
3285000	3287000	most people I meet don't realize
3287000	3289000	I have a different last name but I have
3289000	3291000	to use a different last name on the radio
3291000	3293000	to protect the things I do from 8 to 5
3293000	3295000	Monday through Friday I'm sorry but
3295000	3297000	I'm not sharing the details of my job
3297000	3299000	and my life and how I pay my
3299000	3301000	rent and eat because guess
3301000	3303000	what this show doesn't do that
3303000	3305000	nor any podcast that you listen to
3305000	3307000	unless it's maybe Adam Carolla
3307000	3309000	podcast will not feed somebody
3309000	3311000	if someone gives me a job in exchange for
3311000	3313000	me having to blog about it then I would do
3313000	3315000	that yeah if you want to pay me
3315000	3317000	six digits a year to do this
3317000	3319000	show or you want us to start charging a
3319000	3321000	subscription fees that we start making six digits
3321000	3323000	a year off this show which I still wouldn't think would happen
3323000	3325000	then I'll happily use my
3325000	3327000	real last name
3327000	3329000	but that's you know
3329000	3331000	that's where it's at
3333000	3335000	alright anyhow I didn't mean this to turn into
3335000	3337000	like a stalker privacy conversation
3337000	3339000	but yeah games on Google Plus will you
3339000	3341000	play games on Google Plus let me
3341000	3343000	ask that I would I would think if
3343000	3345000	Google has a hundred million dollars stake
3345000	3347000	in Zynga I think Zynga has
3347000	3349000	a hot new game that they're going to have
3349000	3351000	exclusive on Google Plus and I'm talking like
3351000	3353000	Farmville 2 will be
3353000	3355000	like a big land for Google Plus
3355000	3357000	which is going to make a lot of people eye roll
3357000	3359000	but if they launch it the right
3359000	3361000	way it won't piss everybody off
3361000	3363000	if they if they
3363000	3365000	make it so that it's not in your face
3365000	3367000	people will be fine but this could make or
3367000	3369000	break Google Plus if it's if it's all
3369000	3371000	over and it's Facebook all over again
3371000	3373000	people will just go right back to Facebook
3373000	3375000	because they have their network built up there
3375000	3377000	because you know with Apple
3377000	3379000	going with big integration with
3379000	3381000	Twitter and I'm
3381000	3383000	assuming at some point maybe like Facebook or something
3383000	3385000	like that you know the Android
3385000	3387000	iOS or Android
3387000	3389000	OS I guess is going
3389000	3391000	with Google Plus
3391000	3393000	since it's a Google based
3393000	3395000	operating system it makes sense
3395000	3397000	yeah
3397000	3399000	it has the phrase on here
3399000	3401000	if you're looking for updates shared from games
3401000	3403000	check out your game stream
3403000	3405000	so let's hope it's all
3405000	3407000	hidden in there that would be great
3407000	3409000	because I wouldn't mind playing Who Wants to be a Millionaire on Google
3409000	3411000	that would be kind of fun actually
3411000	3413000	well the whole reason I stopped playing
3413000	3415000	a lot of those stuffs and that's actually why I haven't signed up for
3415000	3417000	Turntable yet is because
3417000	3419000	Turntable requires you to link through
3419000	3421000	your Facebook and I don't like
3421000	3423000	all those apps associated with my Facebook
3423000	3425000	but the good news is I don't use my real
3425000	3427000	name on Facebook either I'm like
3427000	3429000	hey it's alright well see I
3429000	3431000	use my real name but I also use it as a
3431000	3433000	networking tool right right and
3433000	3435000	actually I have it to where the only people
3435000	3437000	who can find me are people I've invited
3437000	3439000	so
3439000	3441000	I don't want to I've seen a lot of people who
3441000	3443000	signed up for things that I might have been interested in
3443000	3445000	later on it uses it'll
3445000	3447000	tag them as a way
3447000	3449000	to advertise their stuff because the tag will show
3449000	3451000	up on your friends feed right
3451000	3453000	and I don't want to be used for something that
3453000	3455000	they're not paying me for right
3455000	3457000	I gotta say though I
3457000	3459000	chose to go ahead and go into Turntable
3459000	3461000	FM and I gotta say that is a
3461000	3463000	rad it's way better than Spotify
3463000	3465000	Turntable FM is awesome
3465000	3467000	well I also read something about the
3467000	3469000	legalities that how they're getting away with it
3469000	3471000	yeah yeah somebody post that to my wall
3471000	3473000	if you haven't seen Turntable FM
3473000	3475000	how can I explain Turntable FM real quick
3475000	3477000	it's basically like you and your friends get to
3477000	3479000	play DJ and you
3479000	3481000	can't go in a room by yourself that's an
3481000	3483000	important thing to know you can but you can't do
3483000	3485000	anything once a friend signs up and it's you
3485000	3487000	and a friend you can set a queue of songs
3487000	3489000	to play and it'll basically go down
3489000	3491000	the line of up to five DJ's
3491000	3493000	and play the next song on your playlist
3493000	3495000	and it sounds so simple
3495000	3497000	but the great thing about it
3497000	3499000	this is me signing up for it are you really doing it?
3499000	3501000	sure why not after that whole thing
3501000	3503000	you just said? well yeah
3503000	3505000	liar no I'm not a liar but
3505000	3507000	that's why I'm not doing the games
3507000	3509000	no I know you can always and you can always go
3509000	3511000	revoke its permissions at any time that's the other thing
3511000	3513000	which I spent like an hour doing
3513000	3515000	because the stupid quizzes count as apps
3515000	3517000	oh yeah oh yeah so no one's in
3517000	3519000	right now so you would be going into random rooms
3519000	3521000	but like if any of your friends were DJ'ing their little
3521000	3523000	pictures would show up on the right hand side
3523000	3525000	and you go into rooms and it just goes down the line
3525000	3527000	and up to five people just it goes
3527000	3529000	in their playlist and it sounds so simple
3529000	3531000	ooh they're playing Fuel I'm going to the 90's
3531000	3533000	mix it's an awesome way to discover new music
3533000	3535000	it is an awesome way to discover new music
3535000	3537000	like me and a couple of my wow guildies
3537000	3539000	were in there the other night just playing
3539000	3541000	random music that we like and it was
3541000	3543000	it was cool I just hey have you guys
3543000	3545000	heard this song? and it comes up next
3545000	3547000	and yeah the legalities highly questionable
3547000	3549000	this website probably won't be around in a year
3549000	3551000	but I'm going to enjoy it while I can
3551000	3553000	there you go
3553000	3555000	alright uh let's
3555000	3557000	move on god we keep bringing up stories
3557000	3559000	and then it like just turns into something else completely
3559000	3561000	there it's on there and everyone has to
3561000	3563000	put up with my music
3563000	3565000	orange tangent radio you know what
3565000	3567000	after the show everyone in my room
3567000	3569000	you should name your room
3569000	3571000	pillow fight dark soccer is pillow fight
3571000	3573000	well but the thing is dark soccer you'd have to
3573000	3575000	you can't the way
3575000	3577000	that's set up and the way they do that legality
3577000	3579000	you can't
3579000	3581000	be the sole DJ
3581000	3583000	you have to be DJing with at least one
3583000	3585000	other person well I did make a room called dark soccer
3585000	3587000	is pillow fight alright so go on turntable
3587000	3589000	FM right now and look for it I'm not going to post any music
3589000	3591000	yet oh yeah I was going to say don't play music right now
3591000	3593000	we're trying to do a show but I've got the room made
3593000	3595000	alright
3595000	3597000	um okay so let's talk
3597000	3599000	Sony here I guess the next
3599000	3601000	uh what is going to be
3601000	3603000	the next big thing from Sony obviously right now their
3603000	3605000	big push is 3D and
3605000	3607000	maybe it's going to be the next evolution of 3D
3607000	3609000	right now apparently according to
3609000	3611000	um an interview with develop
3611000	3613000	uh magazine
3613000	3615000	uh Sony London Studios chief
3615000	3617000	Mick Hawking is
3617000	3619000	talking about some head mounted
3619000	3621000	3D displays that they've been showing off
3621000	3623000	at CES and
3623000	3625000	uh they're saying that we're working with a couple games at
3625000	3627000	Sony that are experimenting with
3627000	3629000	virtual reality type experiences
3629000	3631000	and uh
3631000	3633000	basically saying that VR could make
3633000	3635000	a comeback and definitely
3635000	3637000	you know I think
3637000	3639000	yeah maybe a little bit
3639000	3641000	it could because
3641000	3643000	you know remember back in the day
3643000	3645000	graphics on PC's not
3645000	3647000	that great I mean if anyone's seen
3647000	3649000	lawnmower man ewwww
3649000	3651000	that's pretty basic stuff I saw it in the theater
3651000	3653000	some of those virtual reality demos
3653000	3655000	back in like 95 and stuff were
3655000	3657000	hilarious I distinctly remember
3657000	3659000	one to this day where you could
3659000	3661000	either be a dude walking down the street
3661000	3663000	or like in the car and it was
3663000	3665000	like virtual reality you could walk
3665000	3667000	up to these homes that were just giant blocks
3667000	3669000	like but it was awesome the whole
3669000	3671000	thing looked like um hard driving
3671000	3673000	yeah it seriously
3673000	3675000	was that basic and nowadays
3675000	3677000	I mean you know and who knows when this
3677000	3679000	kind of technology will be coming out
3679000	3681000	just technology keeps getting way
3681000	3683000	better and better each year just exponentially
3683000	3685000	and I mean very well
3685000	3687000	in 10 years we could be seeing some sort of
3687000	3689000	3D virtual
3689000	3691000	reality technology being the kind of
3691000	3693000	standard for gaming and stuff
3693000	3695000	it's definitely within the realm
3695000	3697000	of possibility I suppose
3697000	3699000	and I could definitely see Sony kind of
3699000	3701000	this could definitely certainly maybe
3701000	3703000	happen it's definitely
3703000	3705000	possible it is a
3705000	3707000	distinct absolute
3707000	3709000	possibility
3709000	3711000	there is a chance
3711000	3713000	out there that something like this may
3713000	3715000	or may not happen
3715000	3717000	ah
3717000	3719000	nice
3719000	3721000	alright
3721000	3723000	so
3723000	3725000	moving on I guess I don't know
3725000	3727000	what Sony virtual reality stuff could they
3727000	3729000	really make that would be that awesome
3729000	3731000	well they could
3731000	3733000	really
3733000	3735000	enhance home
3735000	3737000	okay with some virtual reality technology
3737000	3739000	too I don't know allow more members in your
3739000	3741000	clubs
3741000	3743000	alright
3743000	3745000	I'm trying to
3745000	3747000	I'm thinking back to there was a peripheral
3747000	3749000	back in the Super Nintendo
3749000	3751000	days that were just basically goggles
3751000	3753000	you could put on your face that were just
3753000	3755000	televisions literally right in front of your face
3755000	3757000	and they called it a virtual reality headset
3757000	3759000	for games like on the Super Nintendo
3759000	3761000	you know Faceball 2000
3761000	3763000	I played at one time
3763000	3765000	a virtual we played a couple of virtual
3765000	3767000	reality games well it wasn't even
3767000	3769000	really virtual reality it was basically yes
3769000	3771000	monitor on my eyes type
3771000	3773000	thing but
3773000	3775000	it was at Santa Cruz on the
3775000	3777000	beach boardwalk they had a thing
3777000	3779000	that you could do and you could either play Quake
3779000	3781000	or Duke Nukem 3D
3781000	3783000	man
3783000	3785000	awesome it was pretty awesome
3785000	3787000	alright moving
3787000	3789000	there's go ahead
3789000	3791000	I hate getting on all these tangents there's
3791000	3793000	something that they have at the boardwalk it's called being on
3793000	3795000	Orange Long's Radio I know I know there's something that they
3795000	3797000	have on the boardwalk now it's called
3797000	3799000	like Safe Crackers not
3799000	3801000	not Safe Cracker it's like
3801000	3803000	some sort of like heist game
3803000	3805000	where you have to you go in a room
3805000	3807000	and you have to dodge lasers kind of like
3807000	3809000	you know so you're Catherine Zeta Jones
3809000	3811000	yes exactly basically
3811000	3813000	you're doing that and
3813000	3815000	it's a game or you're that scene out of
3815000	3817000	Resident Evil
3817000	3819000	yeah it's very similar to that
3819000	3821000	but it's a game that you play
3821000	3823000	at the Santa Cruz I thought that was kind of cool
3823000	3825000	because I hadn't seen that before
3825000	3827000	my friend posted it on her Facebook
3827000	3829000	that's at the beach boardwalk
3829000	3831000	we need to do an OLR from the Santa Cruz
3831000	3833000	boardwalk I think that would be fun
3833000	3835000	we need to go Dark Sakura
3835000	3837000	don't you want to be like Catherine Zeta Jones and be in the
3837000	3839000	the laser like making sure
3839000	3841000	that the lasers don't hit your boobies
3841000	3843000	I'll go look at it
3843000	3845000	real quick and figure out what that was called
3845000	3847000	I'm sorry the moment you said her name I started thinking of
3847000	3849000	Dawn French impersonating her
3849000	3851000	really I think of T-Mobile commercials
3851000	3853000	have you ever seen
3853000	3855000	the French Insolence Show?
3855000	3857000	yes because you've played it for me like a million times
3857000	3859000	yes
3859000	3861000	Catherine Zeta Spartacus Douglas Jones
3863000	3865000	anyhow
3865000	3867000	no he's not my grandfather he's my husband
3869000	3871000	anyhow yes we need to do a Santa Cruz
3871000	3873000	boardwalk show that would be a lot of fun
3873000	3875000	anyhow moving on
3875000	3877000	talking about the Wii U
3877000	3879000	yes it seems like there's new Wii U news every week
3879000	3881000	and it's somebody reacting to it
3881000	3883000	this week it's Ubisoft is reacting to the Wii U
3883000	3885000	they must like it because it's
3885000	3887000	the whole console has a capital U just like their company
3887000	3889000	well they said
3889000	3891000	Yves Guillemot
3891000	3893000	who is the Ubisoft CEO says
3893000	3895000	we feel this
3895000	3897000	console is coming with very innovative features
3897000	3899000	that will change the video game industry
3899000	3901000	and we want to be a part of that
3901000	3903000	I love that you have a screen very close to you
3903000	3905000	you can get information and send it as well
3905000	3907000	but you don't have to learn
3907000	3909000	too many things
3909000	3911000	I think it's sending the message that the new transition
3911000	3913000	is going to happen and we're going to have new machines
3913000	3915000	coming soon
3915000	3917000	that almost seems like a bad
3917000	3919000	translation to me
3919000	3921000	you get information and send it but you don't have to learn
3921000	3923000	too many things
3923000	3925000	well anyhow
3925000	3927000	speaking of Ubisoft there's been some
3927000	3929000	clarification if you will on Assassin's Creed
3929000	3931000	it is not a port
3931000	3933000	of Revelations
3933000	3935000	the game that is coming to the Wii U is an all new
3935000	3937000	Assassin's Creed title
3937000	3939000	it was part of the little Nintendo announcement
3939000	3941000	they showed a clip of Assassin's Creed
3941000	3943000	but it's actually going to be an all
3943000	3945000	new title
3945000	3947000	that was clarified in the interview
3947000	3949000	so it's something new
3949000	3951000	who knows
3951000	3953000	could be Assassin's Creed 3
3953000	3955000	we'll see
3955000	3957000	but you'll have that
3957000	3959000	screen and you might be able to
3959000	3961000	keep some information secret
3961000	3963000	ok
3963000	3965000	sorry to go back to what I was
3965000	3967000	talking about before
3967000	3969000	it's a game called The Vault
3969000	3971000	and they have
3971000	3973000	a little bit of gameplay
3973000	3975000	that they're showing that's on TV
3975000	3977000	in the lobby or whatever but you have to
3977000	3979000	have these lights shining through and you have to dodge them
3979000	3981000	and they get to where the vault is in the back
3983000	3985000	it looks like fun
3985000	3987000	and they play, you can't hear it
3987000	3989000	but they have the Mission Impossible music playing
3989000	3991000	that actually looks kind of rad
3991000	3993000	I'm not even going to lie, I kind of want to play that
3993000	3995000	but my fat ass would hit so many lasers
3995000	3997000	your gigantic
3997000	3999000	ass just set off five lasers
3999000	4001000	congratulations
4003000	4005000	moving on, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us
4005000	4007000	before we get to release dates after this
4007000	4009000	well how about the
4009000	4011000	roster for Marvel vs. Capcom
4011000	4013000	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3
4013000	4015000	how's that sound?
4015000	4017000	it got leaked and Capcom's not denying it
4017000	4019000	so for Capcom we have Strider Here You
4019000	4021000	Firebrand, Vergil
4021000	4023000	Frank West, Phoenix Wright and Nemesis
4023000	4025000	OBJECTION
4025000	4027000	STARS
4027000	4029000	actually that is going to be reason alone
4029000	4031000	Firebrand, to get the game and that's pretty awesome
4031000	4033000	that Strider is coming back
4033000	4035000	Firebrand, that's awesome
4035000	4037000	that was also a bad guy in Ghost of the Goblins
4037000	4039000	but he had his own two series of games
4039000	4041000	that's right, what about Marvel
4041000	4043000	Marvel we have Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange
4043000	4045000	Nova, Rocket Raccoon
4045000	4047000	Hawkeye, yes
4047000	4049000	and Iron Fist, yes
4049000	4051000	two of my favorite characters on the Marvel side
4051000	4053000	I'm happy and my favorite character
4053000	4055000	on the Capcom side, I'm happy
4055000	4057000	cause
4057000	4059000	well you know back in the day, Dan had
4059000	4061000	a website
4061000	4063000	called Neo Strider Strider Zone
4063000	4065000	he had
4065000	4067000	like old style like
4067000	4069000	Geo Cities type old web page
4069000	4071000	and I did all the graphics for it back in the day
4071000	4073000	oh wow, when we first got together
4073000	4075000	and
4075000	4077000	so
4077000	4079000	we actually
4079000	4081000	he totally got me into the Strider games
4081000	4083000	but now I'm a big fan
4083000	4085000	of the
4085000	4087000	mostly A list but not quite A list
4087000	4089000	the pushing B plus list
4089000	4091000	of Marvel heroes
4091000	4093000	so like my favorite character of all time is Jessica Jones
4093000	4095000	which I know she's not gonna end up in a game but
4095000	4097000	I can dream, but now I finally
4097000	4099000	get Hawkeye in a game
4099000	4101000	that isn't Captain America and the Avengers
4101000	4103000	and Iron Fist
4103000	4105000	who, Iron Fist in a fighting game just makes
4105000	4107000	sense, awesome
4107000	4109000	what do you think though about
4109000	4111000	the whole fact that they're putting out this ultimate
4111000	4113000	Marvel vs Capcom 3 like not even
4113000	4115000	a year after the first game came out I mean
4115000	4117000	isn't that kinda
4117000	4119000	the game needed tweaking, it needed tweaking
4119000	4121000	it needed free tweaking
4121000	4123000	you know what I mean?
4123000	4125000	like it just, I mean
4125000	4127000	you have to admit, this is why
4127000	4129000	people are pissed at Capcom right now about the whole
4129000	4131000	Mega Man Legends 3 thing is that you know you get
4131000	4133000	this slap in the face and then you get this slap
4133000	4135000	in the face, I don't care I don't think it's a slap in the face
4135000	4137000	I'm excited, it's a slap in the face if
4137000	4139000	you bought the original, I did buy the original and I
4139000	4141000	don't care I want this one too, really?
4141000	4143000	yeah, I mean I don't know, Hawkeye
4143000	4145000	I will say this, I bought Street Fighter 4
4145000	4147000	on Xbox 360 and then Super Street Fighter 4
4147000	4149000	is announced I'm like
4149000	4151000	alright well I'll get it on Playstation 3 cause at least
4151000	4153000	I know it'll have a better controller
4153000	4155000	and then, yeah and then the
4155000	4157000	arcade edition comes out so like another 15 bucks
4157000	4159000	but at least that wasn't like a
4159000	4161000	like a full, I mean I know it was a
4161000	4163000	full retail release but at least
4163000	4165000	it was compatible with Super Street Fighter
4165000	4167000	well they had, they had a DLC that
4167000	4169000	you could get that basically made it
4169000	4171000	to where, tournament stick, yeah
4171000	4173000	it was, worth the money
4173000	4175000	they should have done that type of stuff with
4175000	4177000	Marvel vs Capcom 3 except
4177000	4179000	they decided hey you know we're gonna be assholes
4179000	4181000	and we're gonna put out each character for $5 each
4181000	4183000	um
4183000	4185000	no, well they only had two of them
4185000	4187000	this is actually, none of the
4187000	4189000	other characters are gonna be available as DLC
4189000	4191000	they've got Shumagrath and Jill included with
4191000	4193000	this one and then all of the rest of the characters
4193000	4195000	that I named
4195000	4197000	I think I saw something come out of
4197000	4199000	Comic Con about other
4199000	4201000	downloadable characters for the game though
4201000	4203000	they have costumes
4203000	4205000	alternate costumes
4205000	4207000	I thought there were other characters that showed up at the
4207000	4209000	Comic Con that were like download
4209000	4211000	content or something like that, could be wrong
4211000	4213000	well they've also added a spectator mode
4213000	4215000	and other new playable content
4215000	4217000	so basically they said
4217000	4219000	and this is a quote here from
4219000	4221000	Nitsuma said that
4221000	4223000	there's about half and half between the original
4223000	4225000	download content, the planned download content
4225000	4227000	and the new content
4227000	4229000	so basically it's like you're getting
4229000	4231000	well
4233000	4235000	I would look at it as
4235000	4237000	almost a new game
4237000	4239000	like half a new game
4239000	4241000	with everything else that's going
4241000	4243000	into it and honestly that's how I'm looking at it
4243000	4245000	I mean you're getting as many new characters
4245000	4247000	as a new fighting game
4247000	4249000	so I guess that's true
4249000	4251000	at least it's down to 40 bucks too
4251000	4253000	so those of us who didn't buy the game the first time
4253000	4255000	like me, now have a reason to
4255000	4257000	I look at it like a sort of Rock Band 3
4257000	4259000	you know
4259000	4261000	your old characters carry over
4261000	4263000	and you get some new ones, and new content
4263000	4265000	new modes
4265000	4267000	with Rock Band 3, all your
4267000	4269000	songs carry over, and you get
4269000	4271000	symbols, and new modes, and
4271000	4273000	harmony, and most importantly the keyboards
4273000	4275000	and keyboard, you get keyboard cap
4275000	4277000	yeah but I wouldn't exactly say it's
4277000	4279000	very similar to that because
4279000	4281000	why not it's exactly the same
4281000	4283000	why not because the original game is broken
4283000	4285000	they have issues that they need to fix
4285000	4287000	for the online multiplayer, and they're just like
4287000	4289000	eh, we don't want to do that, we're just going to release a new game
4289000	4291000	Rock Band's got issues online
4291000	4293000	ok, but nothing to the point
4293000	4295000	that it's game breaking
4295000	4297000	I mean, it's just
4297000	4299000	I don't play online so I don't give a shit
4299000	4301000	they refuse to fix it, so they're just like
4301000	4303000	oh hey, but by the way, you should buy our new game
4303000	4305000	which very well can have problems of its own
4305000	4307000	fix it because they're going to release ultimate
4307000	4309000	I don't play online, so I honestly personally
4309000	4311000	I don't give a shit about the online play
4311000	4313000	well you may not give a shit, but there's a lot of people who do play online
4313000	4315000	and that's a big thing for them, and they do give a shit
4315000	4317000	then it's their problem
4317000	4319000	I have no problem with it
4319000	4321000	I believe it's gaffcom's problem
4321000	4323000	just a quick note for the live listeners only
4323000	4325000	I don't know what happened, but Winamp crashed
4325000	4327000	so unfortunately you missed that little argument
4327000	4329000	so you'll have to tune into the podcast to hear that
4329000	4331000	Loki and Dark Soccer just got in a little heated
4331000	4333000	discussion about that
4333000	4335000	Loki was having an uncharacteristic
4335000	4337000	caring for other people
4337000	4339000	and I didn't give a shit
4341000	4343000	it's not uncharacteristic for me
4343000	4345000	I care about other people
4345000	4347000	me, myself, and I
4349000	4351000	no, I'm just saying
4351000	4353000	the whole reason I understand
4353000	4355000	expanding and adding new features
4355000	4357000	I think the last game I played online was Fable 2
4357000	4359000	on Xbox Live
4359000	4361000	ok, well then this stuff doesn't bother you
4361000	4363000	that's fine
4363000	4365000	but for people that do play online
4365000	4367000	and I guess I don't play this game online
4367000	4369000	but I empathize with those that do
4369000	4371000	they may be a little bit pissed at the fact that
4371000	4373000	instead of patching the game
4373000	4375000	to make it work like it's supposed to
4375000	4377000	I'm sure there's going to be a patch
4377000	4379000	no, there will not be a patch
4379000	4381000	if they're going to announce a new game
4381000	4383000	why would they fix the old game
4383000	4385000	I agree, the old game is done
4385000	4387000	now that they've announced this
4387000	4389000	there's nothing going to come of the old game
4389000	4391000	and back to this, it's not Capcom's fucking problem
4391000	4393000	people are going to pay for the game
4393000	4395000	they're going to sell it
4395000	4397000	because people love Marvel vs. Capcom 3
4397000	4399000	and I love Hawkeye
4399000	4401000	so I'm getting the game
4401000	4403000	I have to say your Rock Band comparison
4403000	4405000	makes a lot of sense
4405000	4407000	I still don't know
4407000	4409000	if I would really be happy that it's all happening
4409000	4411000	in the same year
4411000	4413000	but that was probably the best
4413000	4415000	argument I've heard for Capcom
4415000	4417000	I can get why people are
4417000	4419000	messed up over it
4419000	4421000	but at the same time
4421000	4423000	they're going to make their money
4423000	4425000	it's not Capcom's problem
4425000	4427000	it's the consumer's problem
4427000	4429000	and the only way it's going to be made
4429000	4431000	is if the consumer does not follow through
4431000	4433000	you're right, this isn't Capcom's problem
4433000	4435000	it wasn't Activision's problem
4435000	4437000	that DJ Hero 1 didn't have any download content
4437000	4439000	because they decided
4439000	4441000	instead of supporting it with download content
4441000	4443000	like we said we were
4443000	4445000	we're just going to, I don't know, put out a new game
4445000	4447000	so Loki, there were like 9 songs
4447000	4449000	you could download for DJ Hero 1
4449000	4451000	so, I mean, that was
4451000	4453000	9 pieces of download content
4453000	4455000	that you could get
4455000	4457000	or Konami and Dance Dance Revolution
4457000	4459000	you know, oh yeah
4459000	4461000	we're going to support this game
4461000	4463000	I know we said we're going to support the last game
4463000	4465000	with download content, but I promise you
4465000	4467000	we're going to support this game with download content
4467000	4469000	and here's your
4469000	4471000	one piece of download content
4471000	4473000	you know, it's just like that
4473000	4475000	and you may remember what happened
4475000	4477000	to Guitar Hero where there wasn't as much
4477000	4479000	download content, but hey, you know what, we released
4479000	4481000	these song packs, because that's what the fans
4481000	4483000	want, they want all their characters
4483000	4485000	and all this cool spectator mode
4485000	4487000	and alternate stuff, because you know what
4487000	4489000	I really need an Elvis costume
4489000	4491000	for my fucking characters
4491000	4493000	that's really canon for
4493000	4495000	Marvel, that's going to be really awesome
4495000	4497000	so
4497000	4499000	looking forward to it
4499000	4501000	oh, and by the way
4501000	4503000	not to nitpick here a little bit
4503000	4505000	Capcom, but
4505000	4507000	your game, Street Fighter
4507000	4509000	versus Tekken, or Street Fighter
4509000	4511000	across Tekken, I know that you've added
4511000	4513000	other Capcom characters, they're not
4513000	4515000	part of Street Fighter, you need to change the fucking title
4515000	4517000	hey hey hey, I'm not to that story yet, you need to wait
4517000	4519000	you just sit and hold that rant
4519000	4521000	alright, we gotta go to some release dates
4521000	4523000	travel around the world
4523000	4525000	and talk about what's coming out to a store near you
4525000	4527000	Loki, start here in the US
4527000	4529000	there's not much of anything coming out this week
4529000	4531000	it's pretty much
4531000	4533000	Catherine
4533000	4535000	that's on PlayStation 3 and
4535000	4537000	Xbox 360, and of course
4537000	4539000	they have the Love Is
4539000	4541000	Something
4541000	4543000	some collector's edition that
4543000	4545000	Love Is Something
4545000	4547000	how about Love Is Over?
4547000	4549000	yeah, Love Is Over
4549000	4551000	you can get that collector's edition that comes with
4551000	4553000	boxers and a t-shirt
4553000	4555000	that's pretty awesome
4555000	4557000	and then of course Pac-Man and Galaga
4557000	4559000	legions
4559000	4561000	how would they know what size boxers to put in there
4561000	4563000	there's only large
4563000	4565000	some Catherine fans are skinny, some are not so skinny
4565000	4567000	well, it's just large
4567000	4569000	the one size fits all
4569000	4571000	well better, you know, some people are larger
4571000	4573000	than large, so
4573000	4575000	you just have to
4575000	4577000	you just have to hang them on the wall
4577000	4579000	if you can't fit into them
4579000	4581000	fair enough
4581000	4583000	make your cat wear them
4583000	4585000	yes, Pac-Man and Galaga dimensions
4585000	4587000	so that's for the 3DS
4587000	4589000	uh
4589000	4591000	and the Sims 3 Town Life
4591000	4593000	stuff expansion is going to be coming out on
4593000	4595000	PC
4595000	4597000	that's literally
4597000	4599000	it, I mean, it's
4599000	4601000	that dead
4601000	4603000	well then let's go to the
4603000	4605000	Xbox 360 in Japan and talk about what's coming
4605000	4607000	out there, on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week
4607000	4609000	Operation Flashpoint
4609000	4611000	Red River comes out this week as well as Dungeon
4611000	4613000	Siege 3 gets its Japanese
4613000	4615000	release this week, that's it on the 360
4615000	4617000	uh, those two games of course
4617000	4619000	on the 28th, going to the Playstation 3
4619000	4621000	Dungeon Siege 3 there as well
4621000	4623000	Operation Flashpoint there as well
4623000	4625000	and a game called Fit in 6
4625000	4627000	Karada o Kichiro
4627000	4629000	6u no Yosu
4629000	4631000	comes out this week, which I believe is just
4631000	4633000	some type of like, like, Playstation
4633000	4635000	Move XR Fitness game, that I guess
4635000	4637000	is a little more tailored
4637000	4639000	I don't know if this is a game we have here, it's by
4639000	4641000	Ubisoft, so I would
4641000	4643000	Fit in 6, yeah, I came out back in March
4643000	4645000	oh, we have this here?
4645000	4647000	shows how much attention I've been paying
4647000	4649000	to the PlayStation, which I still don't own
4649000	4651000	I only know because I set
4651000	4653000	these items up, so
4653000	4655000	alright, then there you go
4655000	4657000	going to, I wanna see if there's anything on the handhelds
4657000	4659000	real quick, or maybe anything in Nintendo's world
4659000	4661000	the Sony PSP
4661000	4663000	has
4663000	4665000	Queensgate Spiral Chaos
4665000	4667000	comes out this week in regular and limited
4667000	4669000	or I guess like a special edition
4669000	4671000	Queensgate is a RPG
4671000	4673000	become the queen of a dimension
4673000	4675000	harness the power of the queens gate
4675000	4677000	the door that connects to all game worlds
4677000	4679000	is taken over by someone evil and
4679000	4681000	ambitious, this game includes
4681000	4683000	Mai from King of Fighters
4683000	4685000	and the ladies from Queensblade
4685000	4687000	so this is kinda like a world's
4687000	4689000	collide type of game, where there's
4689000	4691000	other chicks from other series
4691000	4693000	and it looks like a farting maid
4693000	4695000	that's what that looks like to me in that picture
4695000	4697000	doesn't look like she's going poot
4697000	4699000	and it says hip, look at that
4699000	4701000	who farts with the sound hip
4701000	4703000	hip!
4703000	4705000	cause she's swinging her hip, she's going poot
4705000	4707000	with her hip, could be one of those loud
4707000	4709000	wine poops, you know
4709000	4711000	okay, that's plenty enough
4711000	4713000	hey, I just made it with my mouth
4713000	4715000	Fit and Six also coming out on the Wii in Japan
4715000	4717000	if you care, on the 3DS
4717000	4719000	Super Pokemon Scramble, I remember
4719000	4721000	mentioning that last week, finally a Pokemon game
4721000	4723000	on the 3DS, even though it's not, you know,
4723000	4725000	the Pokemon game, it's
4725000	4727000	Pokemon Dynasty Warriors
4727000	4729000	and lastly
4729000	4731000	on the Nintendo DS, Devil Survivor 2
4731000	4733000	from Atlus this week
4733000	4735000	on the regular DS, non-3D flavor
4735000	4737000	alright, how about the UK?
4737000	4739000	we have a few things
4739000	4741000	we have on the 26th, Call of Juarez
4741000	4743000	the Cartel for PC
4743000	4745000	and Dragon Age 2 Legacy
4745000	4747000	for PS3, PC
4747000	4749000	Xbox 360
4749000	4751000	and on the 27th, Project Dust
4751000	4753000	from Ubisoft on Xbox 360
4753000	4755000	that's about it
4755000	4757000	a couple more news stories for you guys
4757000	4759000	and then the classic game of the week, but first
4759000	4761000	but first, uh
4761000	4763000	there was a person that had
4763000	4765000	the domain for modernwarfare3.com
4765000	4767000	um
4767000	4769000	they were
4769000	4771000	somewhat anonymous via
4771000	4773000	GoDaddy's domains by proxy
4773000	4775000	hiding surface
4775000	4777000	we use that by the way
4777000	4779000	for our own website
4779000	4781000	apparently a domain dispute
4781000	4783000	from Modern Warfare 3's publisher
4783000	4785000	Activision
4785000	4787000	has dissolved that shield
4787000	4789000	it is now apparently
4789000	4791000	known that it is owned by
4791000	4793000	a guy from Florida named Anthony
4793000	4795000	Abram and
4795000	4797000	he is now
4797000	4799000	doing a bunch of random things with the website
4799000	4801000	including, he was at one
4801000	4803000	time redirecting it to Battlefield 3's
4803000	4805000	main site and also
4805000	4807000	spoofing
4807000	4809000	Modern Warfare 3's official
4809000	4811000	site and um
4811000	4813000	you know, making videos
4813000	4815000	that are saying that Modern Warfare 3 is
4815000	4817000	crap and blah blah blah
4817000	4819000	the publisher of course Activision believes
4819000	4821000	that Abram has
4821000	4823000	no right or legitimate
4823000	4825000	interest in the domain name and
4825000	4827000	argues that it's entitled to control
4827000	4829000	given its history with the Modern Warfare
4829000	4831000	IP. Yeah I love how that's
4831000	4833000	granted that this guy, yeah he is
4833000	4835000	a troll and he is
4835000	4837000	the domain name because he knows that
4837000	4839000	Activision is going to have a Modern Warfare 3
4839000	4841000	game at some point. That being
4841000	4843000	said, I still think he should have the website
4843000	4845000	and just because
4845000	4847000	Activision has a game
4847000	4849000	for example if I
4849000	4851000	register a website that's like
4851000	4853000	I don't know
4853000	4855000	awesomesauce.com
4855000	4857000	or something like that and let's just assume
4857000	4859000	that there's no such thing as awesomesauce
4859000	4861000	some person out there decides
4861000	4863000	hey you know what,
4863000	4865000	Heinz57 is going to come out with
4865000	4867000	awesomesauce and we want
4867000	4869000	that domain. You give it to
4869000	4871000	us because we want it.
4871000	4873000	I don't think that because you want something
4873000	4875000	in your company that you should get that.
4875000	4877000	I mean
4877000	4879000	I think that you should have registered
4879000	4881000	that domain a long time ago then.
4881000	4883000	Because you know, Activision
4883000	4885000	I don't know what to tell you but
4885000	4887000	back when you were doing Modern Warfare 2
4887000	4889000	I could have told you that there was going to be a Modern Warfare 3
4889000	4891000	and I mean
4891000	4893000	that's just dumb.
4893000	4895000	He should have done the
4895000	4897000	smarter thing and he should have had
4897000	4899000	some type of club or something
4899000	4901000	that was like the name Modern Warfare
4901000	4903000	or something if he wanted to be smarter about it.
4903000	4905000	Like for instance, I remember this
4905000	4907000	reading about this, the guy who owns
4907000	4909000	or at least did own, I don't know if he still
4909000	4911000	does, I haven't checked it in years but
4911000	4913000	sting.com, the musician
4913000	4915000	Sting tried to sue the guy who owns it
4915000	4917000	because he wanted the domain because he is
4917000	4919000	the celebrity Sting. He is
4919000	4921000	you know, he knows that name.
4921000	4923000	But the guy who owned the domain
4923000	4925000	wasn't trying to troll Sting. He wasn't
4925000	4927000	holding the domain for Sting asking for
4927000	4929000	hundreds of dollars. He was some type of
4929000	4931000	he was either a gamer or something
4931000	4933000	where like that was his handle. And that's what he was
4933000	4935000	known as in the online community. He was Sting
4935000	4937000	for whatever reason. Like he just had
4937000	4939000	nothing to do with the musician. What if he had been the wrestler
4939000	4941000	Sting? Perhaps he was, I don't know.
4941000	4943000	Well the internet foundation
4943000	4945000	or whatever actually found in favor of the guy
4945000	4947000	that he had every right to the
4947000	4949000	name that if Sting wanted it he should have got it first.
4949000	4951000	And you know, and I think to
4951000	4953000	the argument of this guy, Modern Warfare 3
4953000	4955000	that's not the title
4955000	4957000	of the game. That's the subtitle of the game.
4957000	4959000	It's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
4959000	4961000	You know, it's not like Hello Kitty
4961000	4963000	Modern Warfare 3. It's
4963000	4965000	Call of Duty. That is, you know
4965000	4967000	if he had his website was
4967000	4969000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3
4969000	4971000	yeah I think there's a problem there because
4971000	4973000	now you're infringing on, you know, the intellectual
4973000	4975000	properties of Activision.
4975000	4977000	But this is just trolling. It's just like
4977000	4979000	whitehouse.com. It's a porn site.
4979000	4981000	Or it was a porn site.
4981000	4983000	You know, too fucking bad.
4983000	4985000	If the White House
4985000	4987000	can't get a god damn URL
4987000	4989000	then Activision should
4989000	4991000	not get a god damn URL.
4991000	4993000	But if the guy was just
4993000	4995000	trolling and has no legitimate purpose
4995000	4997000	to have that title.
4997000	4999000	Just like these people, like
4999000	5001000	some person sat on JuliaRoberts.com
5001000	5003000	and tried to basically
5003000	5005000	sell it back to her for like
5005000	5007000	$10,000. That's just
5007000	5009000	that's just embezzlement. But he's not doing that.
5009000	5011000	He's just being an asshole. Or not embezzlement.
5011000	5013000	And you know what? He has the right to be an asshole
5013000	5015000	on the internet. And you know what?
5015000	5017000	I don't think he does.
5017000	5019000	I think in this case. If he has no
5019000	5021000	legitimate purpose for holding that website
5021000	5023000	I don't think he
5023000	5025000	I'm just saying he wasn't smart about how he
5025000	5027000	used it. He should have used it. If he wanted
5027000	5029000	to he could have had a dissertation about
5029000	5031000	how Modern Warfare 3 is going to be a
5031000	5033000	terrible game or how to be a review on
5033000	5035000	Modern Warfare 3 and I think he would have had more
5035000	5037000	of a say. I don't know.
5037000	5039000	It just, you know, I think
5039000	5041000	if you're not going to use it for anything
5041000	5043000	worthwhile, there's that
5043000	5045000	committee that'll say, you bring nothing good
5045000	5047000	to the internet. We're shutting you down.
5049000	5051000	SSJ100Matt fuck you in the chat. Yes
5051000	5053000	he changed his name to that. Says, I'm
5053000	5055000	going to register OrangelaungeRadio2.com.
5055000	5057000	Well, okay.
5057000	5059000	Here's what
5059000	5061000	Modern Warfare 2's official website
5061000	5063000	ModernWarfare2.InfinityWar.com
5063000	5065000	Oh, well I guess
5065000	5067000	I can't use that anymore.
5067000	5069000	Oh, damn.
5069000	5071000	But I mean, they have a CallOfDuty.com
5071000	5073000	They can easily do a CallOfDuty
5073000	5075000	slash ModernWarfare3 or
5075000	5077000	they can do Mw3 since that's how
5077000	5079000	it's displayed on the box. I mean
5079000	5081000	there's plenty of
5081000	5083000	things out there. What if
5083000	5085000	What's on that website right now if you try to
5085000	5087000	go to it? What if he went to Modern
5087000	5089000	if he did ModernWarfare3.net
5089000	5091000	or something like that? Is that going to still
5091000	5093000	be an issue? I'm going to the website right now. If this
5093000	5095000	auto plays anything. Oh no, it's just
5095000	5097000	a totally blank page.
5097000	5099000	No source code or nothing.
5101000	5103000	There you go.
5103000	5105000	Thank you. Sturlock
5105000	5107000	rescue me. Extorting. Why couldn't I think of
5107000	5109000	that word? Extorting money out of her.
5109000	5111000	That's what they were trying to do to Julia Roberts. Thank you.
5111000	5113000	Minute and a half later. Thank you buffer.
5113000	5115000	If your Activision just
5115000	5117000	like seriously, who cares?
5117000	5119000	I mean look at like the ModernWarfare2.com
5119000	5121000	was a website
5121000	5123000	and you know it's a ModernWarfare2
5123000	5125000	fan site or something.
5125000	5127000	I mean if like if I came out
5127000	5129000	what if I go and register
5129000	5131000	ModernWarfare4.com
5131000	5133000	What are they going to do?
5133000	5135000	But
5135000	5137000	I'm going to put some stupid articles about Modern
5137000	5139000	Warfare like you know hey there's guns.
5139000	5141000	You should go register
5141000	5143000	MegaManLegends3.com right now since you
5143000	5145000	know no one else is going to use it now.
5145000	5147000	Do they
5147000	5149000	is there a MegaManLegends3.com
5149000	5151000	hold on.
5155000	5157000	Sorry for the dead air but I have to check.
5157000	5159000	Oh no somebody's
5159000	5161000	holding it. It's a troll holding
5161000	5163000	it saying this website's for sale by
5163000	5165000	owner and it's just a bunch of links.
5165000	5167000	That's been going on though since
5167000	5169000	the early dot com
5169000	5171000	business days too. Oh yeah.
5171000	5173000	There's nothing new. Those guys
5173000	5175000	need to be tossed out immediately.
5175000	5177000	Like if I show that I have a legitimate business
5177000	5179000	purpose for those guys
5179000	5181000	need to get tossed. And here's ModernWarfare4.com
5181000	5183000	with a clown on it.
5183000	5185000	It says welcome to ModernWarfare4.
5185000	5187000	website. It would appear that Infinity Ward
5187000	5189000	forgot to purchase this domain. No worries
5189000	5191000	we have good
5191000	5193000	of course they have no spelling.
5193000	5195000	We have good care of it.
5197000	5199000	Is this an extortion plot too?
5199000	5201000	Are we breaking the
5201000	5203000	story here that there is
5203000	5205000	this whole time there's been a ModernWarfare4.com
5205000	5207000	You've all been
5207000	5209000	focused on ModernWarfare3 all
5209000	5211000	week? Well there's a ModernWarfare4
5211000	5213000	out there. There's not a five
5213000	5215000	I'm gonna register five.
5215000	5217000	ModernWarfare5 that's mine.
5217000	5219000	Go get it quick.
5219000	5221000	Use a GoDaddy
5221000	5223000	registration code to do that. Oh wait
5223000	5225000	we're not sponsored by GoDaddy.
5225000	5227000	That would be hilarious.
5227000	5229000	Go ahead.
5229000	5231000	Take the domain.
5231000	5233000	Could
5233000	5235000	someone register would somebody be willing to spend
5235000	5237000	the twenty bucks to register ModernWarfare5.com
5237000	5239000	It's not even twenty bucks it's ten. Ten dollars.
5239000	5241000	Really? Ten dollars. What would we point
5241000	5243000	it to if we bought ModernWarfare5.com
5243000	5245000	right now? What would we point it to? The
5245000	5247000	Ooga Booga site. No.
5247000	5249000	We can make some really
5249000	5251000	fake looking box art or something.
5251000	5253000	Nerf fan site.
5253000	5255000	Modern Warfare with Nerf.
5255000	5257000	It's Nerf and Nerf.
5257000	5259000	Would you be willing to post for pictures
5259000	5261000	modeling with the Nerf bats and so forth?
5261000	5263000	No. You haven't seen Dan's bucket
5263000	5265000	of Nerf. And that could be our
5265000	5267000	little, see we shouldn't say this on the
5267000	5269000	podcast though cause now somebody's registering it right
5269000	5271000	now as we speak. But what it could be
5271000	5273000	I'm cool with you doing that as long as you
5273000	5275000	give it to us cause what we need to do
5275000	5277000	we need to have our Nerf club called the
5277000	5279000	Modern Warfare club and it's just us clubbing
5279000	5281000	each other with Nerf bats and stuff.
5281000	5283000	Well I've actually got not just
5283000	5285000	the Nerf sword, the broadsword
5285000	5287000	I have the axe and the mace.
5289000	5291000	And we have a bunch of Nerf guns.
5291000	5293000	A lot of Nerf guns.
5293000	5295000	And the orange bat.
5295000	5297000	Nice.
5297000	5299000	What about StreetFighter5.com?
5299000	5301000	No.
5301000	5303000	No because Capcom won't have that out for another ten years.
5303000	5305000	Ah see ActDeft I love
5305000	5307000	that thought. ActDeft says redirect
5307000	5309000	it to President Cat.
5309000	5311000	A plus.
5311000	5313000	Send it to the Renowee Twitter.
5313000	5315000	Why not?
5317000	5319000	I like that.
5319000	5321000	That's actually a really good idea. I like that.
5321000	5323000	Easm said it should go to the
5323000	5325000	NRA. Let's put it this way.
5325000	5327000	If Professor Genki is so popular
5327000	5329000	in Saints Row 3 President Cat should
5329000	5331000	easily be able to come out over here.
5331000	5333000	Alright but just
5333000	5335000	a footnote and word of warning.
5335000	5337000	If you register Modern Warfare 5 and give it to us
5337000	5339000	to put our pictures of Nerf fights on
5339000	5341000	if you get sued that's on you.
5341000	5343000	Like I disavow every knowledge
5343000	5345000	that this conversation ever happened.
5347000	5349000	SSJ100MattFuckYou says
5349000	5351000	Rob we really should register a Dance Dance Revolution
5351000	5353000	site and see if Konami gives a shit.
5353000	5355000	Wouldn't mind trolling them.
5355000	5357000	Here's a better one. What if you did it as
5357000	5359000	COD Modern Warfare 5
5359000	5361000	and you're fighting with CODs
5361000	5363000	like fish.
5363000	5365000	Like actual trout
5365000	5367000	snapping IRL.
5367000	5369000	Like M-I-R-C.
5369000	5371000	It could just be pictures. Sky slaps
5371000	5373000	Dark Sakura with a trout and it would
5373000	5375000	be actually me slapping her with a trout.
5377000	5379000	That would be hilarious.
5379000	5381000	That would not be hilarious.
5381000	5383000	That would be smelly.
5383000	5385000	Alright moving on. Speaking of smelly
5385000	5387000	no I got nothing. We got
5387000	5389000	actually this might be kind of smelly. You know the character
5389000	5391000	Poison from Fatal
5391000	5393000	or excuse me Final Fight. You mean the
5393000	5395000	transgender? Is she
5395000	5397000	really? Yes.
5397000	5399000	Is this transgender? Yes it actually
5399000	5401000	is officially said on
5401000	5403000	like way back in an old
5403000	5405000	interview with one of the game designers.
5405000	5407000	It was supposed to be because
5407000	5409000	they couldn't make her a woman in the game
5409000	5411000	because it wasn't right to hit a woman
5411000	5413000	so that's why they made her
5413000	5415000	a man.
5415000	5417000	And then they changed the character sprite
5417000	5419000	in the US. And I think in other
5419000	5421000	places they gave her a longer skirt and covered
5421000	5423000	up her boob. But yeah
5423000	5425000	officially Poison is
5425000	5427000	supposed to be transgendered.
5427000	5429000	Well guess what? You're going to kick some tranny ass
5429000	5431000	in Street Fighter versus
5431000	5433000	Tekken or you can kick ass as
5433000	5435000	a tranny. It's equal opportunity.
5435000	5437000	It is available there.
5437000	5439000	It's going to be Poison is one
5439000	5441000	of the characters there as well as
5441000	5443000	what else was announced here?
5443000	5445000	Dalsim and then from Tekken
5445000	5447000	Steve Fox and Yoshimitsu.
5447000	5449000	Dude Steve Fox was kind of fun. All announced as
5449000	5451000	characters. I wonder if Poison would whip out her dick
5451000	5455000	and smack people.
5455000	5457000	Special attack surprise!
5457000	5459000	I'm all for a diverse character line up in the game
5459000	5461000	but here's the thing.
5461000	5463000	Is that if it's Street Fighter cross Tekken
5463000	5465000	she's a Final Fight character
5465000	5467000	and okay I get it like Guy
5467000	5469000	Cody they kind of crossed over too
5469000	5471000	but does that mean everybody
5471000	5473000	from Final Fight is now part of the Street Fighter
5473000	5475000	canon? Then why can't Poison be
5475000	5477000	in Ultimate Marvel
5477000	5479000	versus Capcom 3?
5479000	5481000	Maybe a download character.
5481000	5483000	I don't know. It just
5483000	5485000	seems like a strange pick
5485000	5487000	to me with so many characters in the Street Fighter
5487000	5489000	universe but okay. They want to
5489000	5491000	bring back or maybe they just
5491000	5493000	somebody really wants to put. It's because they're super
5493000	5495000	Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom 3.
5495000	5497000	See you know what sucks is now I have
5497000	5499000	that song running through my head.
5499000	5501000	That Bill Biv DeVoe song.
5501000	5503000	Good lord.
5503000	5505000	Alright.
5505000	5507000	Moving on.
5507000	5509000	Yeah that was at a panel by the way at Comic Con
5509000	5511000	2011 where it was announced that those
5511000	5513000	characters would be in the game
5513000	5515000	and I guess
5515000	5517000	Hugo, Cody, and Guy
5517000	5519000	have also been teased for the game.
5519000	5521000	Well that would make sense if
5521000	5523000	Poison's in it that Guy and Cody are going to show up at some point
5523000	5525000	as well. Gosh I wonder how many characters
5525000	5527000	this game is supposed to have.
5527000	5529000	It's crazy.
5529000	5531000	So there you go. All characters
5531000	5533000	that are set to come out in Street Fighter cross
5533000	5535000	Tekken which is a game that I'm
5535000	5537000	pretty excited about actually.
5537000	5539000	It should be like Andori
5539000	5541000	who was actually based off of Andre the Giant.
5541000	5543000	Oh yeah?
5543000	5545000	But they changed his name because of the state.
5545000	5547000	Oh right. I remember
5547000	5549000	those characters that look just like
5549000	5551000	Andre the Giant.
5551000	5553000	Funny.
5553000	5555000	Alright. Let's move on to the
5555000	5557000	classic game of the week.
5557000	5559000	Yay. Every week
5559000	5561000	here on Orange Launch Radio we like to take a
5561000	5563000	trip down memory lane. Where's my theme music?
5563000	5565000	Have I lost the theme music?
5565000	5567000	This is
5567000	5569000	a big deal.
5569000	5571000	Where's the theme music?
5571000	5573000	There we go.
5573000	5575000	Yay. This is going to be a very bad
5575000	5577000	mood if I couldn't hear this happy music. Anyway
5577000	5579000	the classic game of the week is a chance for us to walk
5579000	5581000	down memory lane and check out
5581000	5583000	a game that Dark Soccer
5583000	5585000	thinks hey you kids should be playing this game
5585000	5587000	right now. Good luck finding one.
5587000	5589000	Well
5589000	5591000	regardless here it is your classic game of the week.
5591000	5593000	The classic game
5593000	5595000	of the week is Planet Harriers
5595000	5597000	which I brought up
5597000	5599000	at the beginning of the show and I've
5599000	5601000	brought up constantly throughout past shows
5601000	5603000	I'm finally reviewing it because dammit
5603000	5605000	this game is awesome.
5605000	5607000	But it is
5607000	5609000	part of the Space Harrier series and it has a
5609000	5611000	twin cabinet so two people can play at the same
5611000	5613000	time or you can do a networked
5613000	5615000	two player game and
5615000	5617000	you actually play seated
5617000	5619000	and it's controlled through a joystick
5619000	5621000	and a missile and a bullet trigger
5621000	5623000	and you can change your views and you have
5623000	5625000	bomb buttons all on the main panel.
5625000	5627000	So you can choose either four characters.
5627000	5629000	It's Glenn, X, Cory or Nick
5629000	5631000	and basically they
5631000	5633000	fly on the screen and you are
5633000	5635000	behind them so it's
5635000	5637000	that sort of
5637000	5639000	third
5639000	5641000	person style but not
5641000	5643000	quite. And then in two player
5643000	5645000	mode you actually can dock together to save
5645000	5647000	your life and it has the opa opa in it
5647000	5649000	because you cannot have a game
5649000	5651000	in the fantasy zone without the opa
5651000	5653000	opa.
5653000	5655000	So
5655000	5657000	this game, a little bit more information
5657000	5659000	about it is that it actually
5659000	5661000	was
5661000	5663000	on the
5663000	5665000	kakaru system which
5665000	5667000	was basically a double mountain
5667000	5669000	and you can
5669000	5671000	you don't play versus you play
5671000	5673000	as a team to clear off the screen and your joystick
5673000	5675000	is an eight way stick
5675000	5677000	and it's stereo sound
5677000	5679000	and the game came out in 2001
5679000	5681000	and you know the last place that I saw one at
5681000	5683000	was at Great America when we went
5683000	5685000	to see Margaret Cho.
5685000	5687000	They had that there? They had that there.
5687000	5689000	Wow. That's pretty cool.
5689000	5691000	And I remembered because
5691000	5693000	oh the female character that
5693000	5695000	you can play basically she wears
5695000	5697000	a nurse's outfit and shoots a giant
5697000	5699000	syringe as her weapon.
5699000	5701000	But it's also cool because the final boss
5701000	5703000	in this game will
5703000	5705000	turn into a variety of different shapes
5705000	5707000	like it'll be a fish or waves
5707000	5709000	and one of the things it turns into is the Dreamcast logo.
5709000	5711000	The little squirrel.
5711000	5713000	But yeah I mean it's basically
5713000	5715000	you know you
5715000	5717000	have obstacles in your way and
5717000	5719000	when you're actually on the ground you're
5719000	5721000	running on the ground like in Space Harrier
5721000	5723000	but when you're in the air you're shooting
5723000	5725000	and it's got great music
5725000	5727000	it's got great graphics for 2001
5727000	5729000	and it only ever came out in the arcade
5729000	5731000	there was a talk of them doing a
5731000	5733000	Dreamcast port. Never happened.
5733000	5735000	Which I don't see
5735000	5737000	why they didn't because it would be super easy
5737000	5739000	given you know
5739000	5741000	how the Dreamcast is basically
5741000	5743000	now me.
5743000	5745000	The other thing that I liked about this one too and it's actually the part
5745000	5747000	that you just got to on Video Rob is it has
5747000	5749000	a shop like in
5749000	5752000	Fantasy Zone.
5752000	5754000	I was going to say it reminds me of Fantasy Zone.
5754000	5756000	Yeah so you can go in and you buy like
5756000	5758000	big bombs or more speed or
5758000	5760000	more shield
5760000	5762000	and you use it to power yourself up as you go along
5762000	5764000	because you're also collecting
5764000	5766000	your points and your money
5766000	5768000	as you go along too.
5768000	5770000	So it's just a really neat game
5770000	5772000	and they didn't
5772000	5774000	really I think make a whole lot of them
5774000	5776000	and it kind of died out so
5776000	5778000	there's no home version of this.
5778000	5780000	Now I've been trying
5780000	5782000	to find it emulated and from
5782000	5784000	what I understand
5784000	5786000	what was it that I downloaded today?
5786000	5788000	Apparently
5788000	5790000	the main
5790000	5792000	.14164
5792000	5794000	bit runs it but I
5794000	5796000	don't think very well.
5796000	5798000	I haven't been able to find much more else about
5798000	5800000	the emulation but really that's the only way
5800000	5802000	you're probably going to be able to play it unless you have to
5802000	5804000	know where one is and if you know where one is
5804000	5806000	tell me so that I can go play it.
5806000	5808000	I was so pissed off when we went to the
5808000	5810000	Sega Arcade in Seattle to Gameworks
5810000	5812000	and they did not have a Planet Harrier.
5812000	5814000	How could they not have a Planet Harriers?
5814000	5816000	They should just we need to have
5816000	5818000	a set release called
5818000	5820000	The Ultimate Fantasy Zone
5820000	5822000	which is all the Fantasy Zone games including
5822000	5824000	Fantasy Zone The Maze and Space Harrier
5824000	5826000	and Planet Harriers.
5826000	5828000	Oh you could also
5828000	5830000	you also did have a bonus of characters
5830000	5832000	in there but I did not remember how to get them.
5832000	5834000	I thought you were going to buy the former Sunrise Fun
5834000	5836000	Center and make it your bitch and you were
5836000	5838000	going to put all these great games in that place.
5838000	5840000	You know what? When I have money
5840000	5842000	I'll be doing that.
5842000	5844000	So maybe in
5844000	5846000	2035.
5848000	5850000	But that is the classic game.
5850000	5852000	There it is. Planet Harrier.
5852000	5854000	Your classic plastic game of the week.
5854000	5856000	The seat is plastic.
5856000	5858000	Your classic game
5858000	5860000	of the week. Alright we got plenty
5860000	5862000	more show to go but don't go anywhere.
5862000	5864000	We're going to be right back after this quick break
5864000	5866000	with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio
5866000	5868000	including more news on things like Minecraft
5868000	5870000	and Child of Eden on the
5870000	5872000	Playstation 3 and then we're going to talk about
5872000	5874000	getting sued. Good times.

5876000	5878000	so excited. A list list tonight.

5880000	5882000	list tonight when we come back with more of

5912000	5914000	throughout the week so check that out.
5914000	5916000	I thought before we get into part B in the
5916000	5918000	news tonight I wanted to touch on this story.
5918000	5920000	This is something that Salacious Pop brought to my
5920000	5922000	attention this week and I
5922000	5924000	thought for sure Dark Sakura
5924000	5926000	of all people might have a perspective
5926000	5928000	on this one so I'm going to kind of blindside
5928000	5930000	her a little bit with this story. Yeah. Because
5930000	5932000	this has to do with women
5932000	5934000	kind of. Let me explain.
5934000	5936000	Okay I'm equipped. Alright.
5936000	5938000	Well sort of. Wait till I get to this.
5938000	5940000	Okay. So Kotaku ran this story earlier this
5940000	5942000	week. This is something that Salacious Pop
5942000	5944000	emailed me and the title is called
5944000	5946000	Well That's One Way to Combat
5946000	5948000	Misogyny in Gaming.
5948000	5950000	And what it's basically getting at is that there's a
5950000	5952000	large LAN party that happens in Texas
5952000	5954000	and it's being organized to celebrate
5954000	5956000	the launch of Battlefield 3.
5956000	5958000	Which is you know this big game that's being launched
5958000	5960000	and so forth. They've decided that the best
5960000	5962000	way to deal with slurs
5962000	5964000	that end up getting hurled at
5964000	5966000	female gamers at these events
5966000	5968000	is to just prevent women from attending.
5968000	5970000	So no women will be allowed
5970000	5972000	to attend this event in
5972000	5974000	Texas. Let me read a
5974000	5976000	quote from the FAQ. Hold on. Hold on.
5976000	5978000	Quote
5978000	5980000	Nothing ruins a good LAN party
5980000	5982000	like a woman. No that's not the quote.
5982000	5984000	Okay. Nothing ruins a good
5984000	5986000	LAN party like uncomfortable guests
5986000	5988000	or lots of tension.
5988000	5990000	Both of which can result from mixing
5990000	5992000	immature misogynistic male gamers
5992000	5994000	with female counterparts.
5994000	5996000	Though we've done our best to avoid these
5996000	5998000	situations in years past, we've
5998000	6000000	certainly had our share of problems.
6000000	6002000	As a result we no longer allow
6002000	6004000	women to attend the event.
6004000	6006000	Now
6006000	6008000	thoughts so far before I read the
6008000	6010000	update. I will be fair. This paragraph
6010000	6012000	has since been changed but let's
6012000	6014000	let's hear dark soccer's initial reaction.
6014000	6016000	If they're a private organization
6016000	6018000	and
6018000	6020000	then they do have
6020000	6022000	the right as a private
6022000	6024000	organization. However
6024000	6026000	you
6026000	6028000	have the right to call them dickheads.
6028000	6030000	Well
6030000	6032000	it just goes back to lower
6032000	6034000	my impression of Texas.
6034000	6036000	People
6036000	6038000	do not have any logic
6038000	6040000	in the south and I can say this because I'm
6040000	6042000	there. It's like
6042000	6044000	very few people
6044000	6046000	think
6046000	6048000	outside of
6048000	6050000	the box. Just go for
6050000	6052000	well this will be the easy way we just won't have
6052000	6054000	chicks there huh? Well for this whole weekend they
6054000	6056000	will all be thinking outside of the box
6056000	6058000	because there will be no boxes at this
6058000	6060000	event if you know what I mean.
6060000	6062000	Well this is why
6062000	6064000	sorry that this
6064000	6066000	is why male
6066000	6068000	geeks get a bad rep.
6068000	6070000	You are afraid
6070000	6072000	of us. And so
6072000	6074000	when we kick your ass you have to
6074000	6076000	resort to name calling.
6076000	6078000	Like you do with
6078000	6080000	when some noob kicks your ass.
6080000	6082000	It's just immaturity
6082000	6084000	is all it is. They just name call everybody
6084000	6086000	and it's the women that get upset
6086000	6088000	about it.
6088000	6090000	Maybe if women would cry less they
6090000	6092000	get invited to these events.
6092000	6094000	Well no I think the whole thing is that
6094000	6096000	you know it would be
6096000	6098000	exactly the same if it were two guys okay.
6098000	6100000	You have guy one going oh you stupid slut
6100000	6102000	and she goes oh yeah you dumb prick.
6102000	6104000	You know instead you have like you asshole
6104000	6106000	bitch. Well I'm going to
6106000	6108000	tell you this. I'm going to tell you this.
6108000	6110000	It's not going to stop
6110000	6112000	that whole and you can't tell me this
6112000	6114000	doesn't happen in Texas.
6114000	6116000	You kill me stop being such
6116000	6118000	a fag. You're being a fag.
6118000	6120000	You're a little fag right now and
6120000	6122000	I guarantee you
6122000	6124000	in a room like that there's going to
6124000	6126000	be at least one.
6126000	6128000	Who passed the penis check.
6128000	6130000	And the other thing too if you got to
6130000	6132000	complain about people killing you in a
6132000	6134000	death match where the point is to kill
6134000	6136000	each other
6136000	6138000	I don't I don't understand why are you killing
6138000	6140000	me. Why are you killing me because it's
6140000	6142000	the point of the game. I'm calling for
6142000	6144000	infiltration.
6144000	6146000	Infiltration. Women women
6146000	6148000	run in stampede.
6148000	6150000	Burn your bras. No.
6150000	6152000	I'm calling for
6152000	6154000	chick drag. Chick drag.
6154000	6156000	You know what exists. Oh yeah
6156000	6158000	oh god. I was I was at the bar
6158000	6160000	one night with friends with a birthday
6160000	6162000	celebration. We got there a little early and we walked
6162000	6164000	right in on a drag king show. I kid you not
6164000	6166000	and that's what you'd
6166000	6168000	expect. I was some drag kings and some nice butch
6168000	6170000	lesbians to go in. It was it was very
6170000	6172000	butch. It was
6172000	6174000	not it was it wasn't sassy like
6174000	6176000	drag queens are you know. Drag queens are
6176000	6178000	very sassy. Because drag queens are taking
6178000	6180000	the ultimate of
6180000	6182000	the feminine mystique
6182000	6184000	and playing playing
6184000	6186000	it all of it up. So that's the same thing for
6186000	6188000	drag kings that they take the boring
6188000	6190000	dude-ness and make it more boring and
6190000	6192000	dudely. Alright going to the chatroom
6192000	6194000	at chat.org.com tons of comments in chat
6194000	6196000	here. Act Dev says they should ban the immature
6196000	6198000	people instead of women. Breakman
6198000	6200000	says nothing ruins. Everyone in Texas.
6200000	6202000	Nothing ruins a good sausage fest like
6202000	6204000	a woman.
6204000	6206000	Um
6206000	6208000	uh let's see
6208000	6210000	going uh what's this uh
6210000	6212000	laha says this is why we can't have nice
6212000	6214000	things. Frisbee says
6214000	6216000	this isn't the south this is Texas.
6216000	6224000	Alright look to be fair there was an update. They did remove that paragraph and here's what happened.
6224000	6228000	They're saying this event is a gentleman's retreat.
6228000	6236000	Quote we actively discourage gamers from being the kind of misogynistic jack wagon seen in the reddit post and such
6236000	6238000	behavior should not be tolerated.
6238000	6240000	Frankly we don't like that kind of
6240000	6242000	player either. So far as this event
6242000	6244000	goes it's a special event designed
6244000	6246000	specifically for male gamers.
6246000	6248000	Further it is meant as a getaway
6248000	6250000	designed to help said male
6250000	6252000	contingent become better men
6252000	6254000	both for themselves and for those who love
6254000	6256000	us.
6256000	6258000	Yeah that's more bullshit.
6258000	6260000	I gotta tell ya
6260000	6262000	I gotta tell ya
6262000	6264000	I've never been to no I was in Texas
6264000	6266000	once for like five minutes. For the few smart
6266000	6268000	people in Texas like Travis
6268000	6270000	you're not on the
6270000	6272000	stupid list. Yes. Most everybody
6272000	6274000	else is on the stupid list. I know I know plenty
6274000	6276000	of smart people in Texas and there's
6276000	6278000	some that listen to this show actually. It's just
6278000	6280000	it's like Jeff Foxworthy says
6280000	6282000	when it comes time to talk about the south
6282000	6284000	the news always points out the
6284000	6286000	least common denominator.
6286000	6288000	You know. Here's the
6288000	6290000	thing I gotta admit there's a part
6290000	6292000	of me that's a little bit tempted since it
6292000	6294000	is an all male retreat.
6294000	6296000	It's only forty nine bucks
6296000	6298000	maybe I should go and
6298000	6300000	maybe I should flame it up a little bit.
6302000	6304000	You know what. I
6304000	6306000	heard there was a retreat.
6308000	6310000	Oh my god
6310000	6312000	we're gonna play some battlefield.
6314000	6316000	I loves battlefield.
6318000	6320000	He just shot you in the head
6320000	6322000	what a stupid bitch.
6324000	6326000	There's a small
6326000	6328000	part of me that wants to even though I would
6328000	6330000	I would play up to every negative stereotype
6330000	6332000	I'm sure these guys already have like I just
6332000	6334000	you know there's that part of me that just
6334000	6336000	wants to ruin
6336000	6338000	their day. Now here's my idea.
6338000	6340000	One
6340000	6342000	you either have the infiltration go
6342000	6344000	on have a woman beat
6344000	6346000	all the guys asses and go oh by the way here's my
6346000	6348000	boobs. Or
6348000	6350000	the ladies have their own counter retreat.
6350000	6352000	Say fine
6352000	6354000	you're not inviting us bitches you're not
6354000	6356000	allowed.
6356000	6358000	And
6358000	6360000	some interesting comments from chat here
6360000	6362000	Black Wolf says are they also telling
6362000	6364000	black people to stay home. No
6364000	6366000	race is not a part of this.
6366000	6368000	So they're just sexist not racist.
6368000	6370000	They're just sexist and I'm
6370000	6372000	gonna just guess with
6372000	6374000	nothing to back me up also homophobic.
6374000	6376000	Duh it's Texas.
6376000	6378000	And maybe a little bit racist but I don't know
6378000	6380000	but no we're not seeing any apparent
6380000	6382000	racism going on here. Okay.
6382000	6384000	Salacious Pop says Loki I feel
6384000	6386000	that women who opt into participating in that
6386000	6388000	first person shooter culture know what they're getting into
6388000	6390000	to a point but neckbeards realize
6390000	6392000	this and decide to escalate it until it
6392000	6394000	becomes pretty disgusting and unacceptable
6394000	6396000	no matter what kind of game it is and a line just
6396000	6398000	gets crossed. And you should be able to shit
6398000	6400000	talk without going the gender race
6400000	6402000	gay route. It just means you're not very
6402000	6404000	articulate. Aha
6404000	6406000	become a smarter cut lower
6406000	6408000	person.
6408000	6410000	There you go. You just need to be smarter
6410000	6412000	about your
6412000	6414000	cut downs.
6414000	6416000	But I mean and I'm
6416000	6418000	and this
6418000	6420000	is why I say this and people
6420000	6422000	smart people in the south will know what I'm
6422000	6424000	talking about is that
6424000	6426000	that's just it just is like
6426000	6428000	typical. It's just
6428000	6430000	typical.
6430000	6432000	Black Wolf in our chatroom says devil's advocate
6432000	6434000	there are plenty of female only
6434000	6436000	LAN events and that's empowering girl
6436000	6438000	gamers.
6438000	6440000	True. But you you don't
6440000	6442000	want to backpedaling here a little
6442000	6444000	bit. So it makes it know that they have
6444000	6446000	the frag dolls and the reason why
6446000	6448000	they're doing well team
6448000	6450000	so they don't they don't
6450000	6452000	allow man in the frag dolls at all. Like if I try
6452000	6454000	to be a frag doll I couldn't do it.
6454000	6456000	Yeah you go ahead and play your first
6456000	6458000	person shooters step into Grand Theft
6458000	6460000	Auto and we'll own your
6460000	6462000	but
6462000	6464000	but the whole the whole point is just
6464000	6466000	that it's it's really
6466000	6468000	and break man is asking us to stop hating
6468000	6470000	on the neck beards please. He has
6470000	6472000	a neck beer and he's feeling a little offended right now so
6472000	6474000	that we need to stop being neck beer
6474000	6476000	phobic. Hey
6476000	6478000	ZZ top.
6478000	6480000	All right. But but my
6480000	6482000	point is
6482000	6484000	this is shit that I've run into
6484000	6486000	all the time when I lived in Alabama.
6486000	6488000	Like
6488000	6490000	I could be the
6490000	6492000	my geek knowledge far
6492000	6494000	exceeded any of the guys
6494000	6496000	but you know
6496000	6498000	we're doing a guy party sorry.
6498000	6500000	Fuck you.
6500000	6502000	I just kicked your ass
6502000	6504000	at this game yesterday is that why I'm not going?
6504000	6506000	No comment.
6506000	6508000	Yeah. All right look
6508000	6510000	I just wanted to bring that up at some point.
6510000	6512000	I didn't mean to you know dominate our show with that
6512000	6514000	talk but I thought it would be an interesting little
6514000	6516000	aside. We do have a list list coming up
6516000	6518000	later this hour so stay tuned for that
6518000	6520000	and also we're
6520000	6522000	going to get into the rapid fire news
6522000	6524000	but I got to do quick plugs for other shows
6524000	6526000	Hoard House is my World of
6526000	6528000	Warcraft podcast I do with my buddy
6528000	6530000	the best little Hoard House in Azeroth. We did put
6530000	6532000	out a new show this week. There's a contest
6532000	6534000	this week you got to listen to the very very very very
6534000	6536000	end but there's a contest this week as well for
6536000	6538000	free game time which any WoW player
6538000	6540000	is going to want and I know is a good prize there
6540000	6542000	so check that out. Hoardhouse.com
6542000	6544000	is the website and
6544000	6546000	yeah all the information and then some
6546000	6548000	you could stomach on the World of Warcraft
6548000	6550000	Has anyone
6550000	6552000	guessed it on any podcast or anything this week?
6552000	6554000	Yes!
6554000	6556000	What did you guess on this week? Well as I said last week
6556000	6558000	I'm on two episodes
6558000	6560000	of Pop Culture Parlay
6560000	6562000	Ah you did an episode arc. Yes.
6562000	6564000	Which you can go to
6564000	6566000	geek-life.com and download
6566000	6568000	or go on iTunes. There you go.
6568000	6570000	Ta da! All right check that out. Pop Culture Parlay
6570000	6572000	I did listen to a little bit of that first episode
6572000	6574000	you were on while I was driving to the store
6574000	6576000	or something. And I was recently on Girls
6576000	6578000	Gone Well. So you can look back for that
6578000	6580000	episode too. The Mystery Third
6580000	6582000	podcast I'm hoping will be a reality very
6582000	6584000	soon. We've just had some
6584000	6586000	We're Too Busy setbacks going on and
6586000	6588000	knowing my week next week that's
6588000	6590000	not going to get any better so we'll see what happens
6590000	6592000	I'm busy Monday Tuesday Wednesday so
6592000	6594000	Busy busy bee
6594000	6596000	So hopefully we'll get that
6596000	6598000	together. There is a third podcast coming
6598000	6600000	It's not going to
6600000	6602000	be like a huge thing. It will be like
6602000	6604000	30 minutes tops a week
6604000	6606000	Brakeman suggests you go as Captain Sassy Pants
6606000	6608000	We'll see
6608000	6610000	So yeah
6610000	6612000	that's to look forward to and then
6612000	6614000	also speaking of like guesting on shows and stuff
6614000	6616000	I just want to kind of throw that out there like
6616000	6618000	you know if you have a podcast or your own
6618000	6620000	show I've heard some
6620000	6622000	people say like oh well I would
6622000	6624000	ask you to be on the show but my show is just
6624000	6626000	this little little show that's
6626000	6628000	nothing nothing serious and you know
6628000	6630000	I never wanted to ask you guys because I'm too shy
6630000	6632000	Dude if I have the time
6632000	6634000	I will gladly come on any show
6634000	6636000	like as long as your show isn't you know
6636000	6638000	like negative
6638000	6640000	about like as long as I'm not walking into a
6640000	6642000	show that's all like homophobic trash talking
6642000	6644000	and stuff like that but you know what I mean like if you're
6644000	6646000	generally generally an intelligent person
6646000	6648000	that's all I ask I'm gonna
6648000	6650000	I'd be happy to guest on any show
6650000	6652000	Me too. The size of this show is not
6652000	6654000	that large so don't
6654000	6656000	don't feel like you can't ever approach us
6656000	6658000	No size isn't what matters it's girth
6658000	6660000	So you can email us either at mailbag
6660000	6662000	at orangeonshadeo.com or you can even email me
6662000	6664000	directly at I just I just went

6684000	6686000	a hold of us too that's how it still got a hold of me so
6686000	6688000	excellent yeah so there you go
6688000	6690000	we're always happy to come and you know
6690000	6692000	we're approaching our tenth year of podcasting
6692000	6694000	and we want it to be a big fucking deal
6694000	6696000	so especially come next year
6696000	6698000	we're going to try and go on as many shows as we can
6698000	6700000	so we're always happy to do that
6700000	6702000	anyhow so I want to say give us more stuff to plug
6702000	6704000	at the top of part B
6704000	6706000	until our third podcast launches
6706000	6708000	alright let's get into some rapid
6708000	6710000	fire news some news that
6710000	6712000	we just didn't have time to cover elsewhere
6712000	6714000	uh yes of course
6714000	6716000	there's some more details now
6716000	6718000	out about the 360
6718000	6720000	port of Minecraft
6720000	6722000	this is coming from Notch
6722000	6724000	of course the guy behind Minecraft
6724000	6726000	and saying there's actually going to be
6726000	6728000	marketing for the Xbox 360 version
6728000	6730000	of Minecraft so I've agreed
6730000	6732000	to be slightly less transparent
6732000	6734000	than usual when it comes to that
6734000	6736000	version and
6736000	6738000	basically saying that there's going to be some
6738000	6740000	cool stuff in there including
6740000	6742000	there's completely different crafting
6742000	6744000	and that the Kinect functionality
6744000	6746000	will include a mode where you have to wave your arms
6746000	6748000	around to mine and
6748000	6750000	use items it's just too silly not to
6750000	6752000	include and also
6752000	6754000	can you actually flail as you're running away from the ghost?
6754000	6756000	ah!
6756000	6758000	uh
6758000	6760000	that's what I'm going to do at the gentleman's retreat
6760000	6762000	for Battlefield by the way don't shoot me
6764000	6766000	I don't know about that
6766000	6768000	basically
6768000	6770000	he also said that there's of course
6770000	6772000	the Xperia Play version of Minecraft
6772000	6774000	that's going to be coming out
6774000	6776000	for $7 sometime this
6776000	6778000	fall and
6778000	6780000	I guess it'll make it
6780000	6782000	it's programmed in a way that'll make it easy to port to all sorts
6782000	6784000	of mobile phones
6784000	6786000	so that's kind of neat
6786000	6788000	so I'm sure we'll hear more
6788000	6790000	details as we get closer to its
6790000	6792000	release I'm sure it'll be pretty big
6792000	6794000	um if you
6794000	6796000	just love Valve and you really want
6796000	6798000	to get your hands on some Valve action
6798000	6800000	figures and other stuff
6800000	6802000	well you're going to wait until 2012
6802000	6804000	but toy company NECA
6804000	6806000	they have revealed their lineup at
6806000	6808000	Comic Con um including
6808000	6810000	a bunch of different franchises starting with Half Life 2
6810000	6812000	you can be able to get a Gordon Freeman action
6812000	6814000	figure uh Team Fortress 2
6814000	6816000	you can get a Pyro Heavy and Demo
6816000	6818000	action figure and also
6818000	6820000	they have Left 4 Dead the Boomer and
6820000	6822000	Smoker action figures and finally
6822000	6824000	for Portal 2 Atlas
6824000	6826000	and Peabody action figures as well
6826000	6828000	as a replica um
6828000	6830000	portal gun um and a resin
6830000	6832000	and plush
6832000	6834000	weighted companion cube
6834000	6836000	so portal gun
6836000	6838000	that's going to be pretty awesome
6838000	6840000	I'm telling you though
6840000	6842000	NECA um
6842000	6844000	if you really want to impress me
6844000	6846000	you'll do full size turret
6846000	6848000	bots
6848000	6850000	they come in the box do they sing
6850000	6852000	because if that's the case I kind of want one
6852000	6854000	will it randomly
6854000	6856000	just go are you still there?
6856000	6858000	you may remember that I am still working on my paper
6858000	6860000	craft turret that is full size
6860000	6862000	I do remember that
6862000	6864000	occasionally when I'm not working
6864000	6866000	on my Grand Theft Auto stuff I'll be working on that
6866000	6868000	it looks nice
6868000	6870000	it will be uh large
6870000	6872000	alright can't wait for you to
6872000	6874000	bring that to the show are you going to bring that to episode 500?
6874000	6876000	yeah sure
6876000	6878000	um and then finally um
6878000	6880000	Grasshopper manufacturing is putting out
6880000	6882000	a new game it was featured
6882000	6884000	in Famitsu Magazine
6884000	6886000	and it is
6886000	6888000	straight up Grasshopper
6888000	6890000	um Lollipop
6890000	6892000	Chainsaw is the new game it's going to be
6892000	6894000	coming out on Playstation 3 and 360
6894000	6896000	it is basically a game about
6896000	6898000	a cheerleader raised by zombie hunters
6898000	6900000	who uses her acrobatic training
6900000	6902000	and chainsaws to destroy zombies
6902000	6904000	wasn't that a side plot
6904000	6906000	in Jurassic Park 2?
6906000	6908000	where that acrobat little girl
6908000	6910000	like kicked the dinosaur in the face
6910000	6912000	yeah they said that was retarded
6912000	6914000	this looks awesome
6914000	6916000	hey hey hey you said you're not going to use that word anymore
6916000	6918000	yeah whatever
6918000	6920000	so this should be pretty awesome
6920000	6922000	they have some screenshots up for it
6922000	6924000	she's got a chainsaw
6924000	6926000	with hearts on it and she's killing zombies
6926000	6928000	so um it sounds to me
6928000	6930000	almost a little bit like Oni Chambara
6930000	6932000	um just
6932000	6934000	hopefully plays a lot better
6934000	6936000	and of course
6936000	6938000	a Kiriyamaoka working on the sound
6938000	6940000	nice
6940000	6942000	so all good
6942000	6944000	that would have made the Jurassic Park 2
6944000	6946000	a lot better if Kiriyamaoka had done the soundtrack
6946000	6948000	did you hear there's by the way a confirmed
6948000	6950000	Jurassic Park 4 is in development
6950000	6952000	they want to bring that back
6952000	6954000	I loved those movies when I was a kid at least the first one
6954000	6956000	I think the plot of them you know
6956000	6958000	somehow making it to mainland
6958000	6960000	and kind of spreading would be pretty awesome
6960000	6962000	no because that's what happened at the end of the second movie
6962000	6964000	and it was terrible that's what made that movie so bad
6964000	6966000	no what made it bad
6966000	6968000	is just they have a feature of the T-Rex
6968000	6970000	I'm talking about like you know where
6970000	6972000	it's years later where they're multiplying
6972000	6974000	and coming out in small towns
6974000	6976000	and stuff they have the planet of the dinosaurs
6976000	6978000	you know track them down
6978000	6980000	alright anyhow moving on with other rapid fire news
6980000	6982000	Team Fortress 2 whatever happens with big games
6982000	6984000	they get demade that's right
6984000	6986000	a demake has come out of Team Fortress 2
6986000	6988000	it's now a 2D beat em up
6988000	6990000	uh it's one guy
6990000	6992000	running his own development house Eric Ruth
6992000	6994000	from Team Fortress 2
6994000	6996000	Team Fortress Arcade is the name of the game
6996000	6998000	it's an old school side scrolling beat em up
6998000	7000000	each character that's from Team Fortress
7000000	7002000	has weapons and ability that are similar to
7002000	7004000	it's class in Team Fortress 2
7004000	7006000	for example the Demoman can blast out sticky bombs
7006000	7008000	and explode whenever he does the jumping
7008000	7010000	engineerings can do upgrades
7010000	7012000	with the wrench and so forth
7012000	7014000	there's actually some hands on sessions
7014000	7016000	that have been reviewed on around the internet
7016000	7018000	and there's even a little YouTube there
7018000	7020000	that I guess some site did
7020000	7022000	review and you can actually I think he's probably
7022000	7024000	talking over this but let me see if he get
7024000	7026000	yeah he talks over that
7026000	7028000	but you can actually see here in studio we can see the
7028000	7030000	kind of gameplay emotion it looks like
7030000	7032000	that old school kind of 2D fighter it looks kind of fun
7032000	7034000	and Eric Ruth you may remember is the same guy
7034000	7036000	did all the demakes of like you know
7036000	7038000	all the NES things oh really
7038000	7040000	like the Left 4 Dead so this guy's a

7118000	7120000	what is this going on here
7120000	7122000	ok remember Mortal Kombat and the download characters
7122000	7124000	Mortal Kombat and we knew for
7124000	7126000	quite some time that there was going to be
7126000	7128000	Kenshi there was going to be
7128000	7130000	Scarlet and Rain we knew those
7130000	7132000	three characters for quite some time but
7132000	7134000	Warner Brothers really kept the
7134000	7136000	fourth character under wraps for a long
7136000	7138000	time well the fourth character was revealed
7138000	7140000	this week the fourth download character
7140000	7142000	from Mortal Kombat is going to be
7142000	7144000	not Tanya not
7144000	7146000	Meat it's going to be Freddy Krueger
7148000	7150000	to which a lot of people kind of went
7150000	7152000	what kind of want
7152000	7154000	like I think that was the reaction
7154000	7156000	most of my friends was like ok
7156000	7158000	it's kind of cool I guess I'll
7158000	7160000	I can do this I like the
7160000	7162000	fatalities yeah
7162000	7164000	no yeah the fatalities in the video were pretty awesome
7164000	7166000	like throwing one into the incinerator or whatever
7166000	7168000	the furnace because you had the boiler
7168000	7170000	room and the first one that they showed
7170000	7172000	with him pulling him down and the blood coming up
7172000	7174000	that was a nod back to the first movie
7174000	7176000	that was the scene right out of the first movie
7176000	7178000	Johnny Depp awesome
7178000	7180000	so yeah Freddy Krueger
7180000	7182000	is going to be the fourth download character
7182000	7184000	it's really one of those things where you look at it and go
7184000	7186000	I don't get it but I kind of do
7186000	7188000	it's not like it's something
7188000	7190000	completely random I guess should be interesting
7190000	7192000	so yeah that will cost you
7192000	7194000	either $4.99 or $400
7194000	7196000	Microsoft points unless you're a season pass

7282000	7284000	is going to be about half as much
7284000	7286000	for the PS3 version so
7286000	7288000	hey
7288000	7290000	that's it
7290000	7292000	awesome
7292000	7294000	alright I guess we should go to the Twitter although
7294000	7296000	I forgot to plug that at the top of the show
7296000	7298000	so I don't know if we actually got a lot of tweets tonight
7298000	7300000	but that's okay because we're running along
7300000	7302000	anyway so I guess something's got to give at some point
7302000	7304000	what's going on in the twatter?
7304000	7306000	let's go look at the twatter right now
7306000	7308000	before I get to Twitter though can I say
7308000	7310000	there's another game I've been playing this week that I forgot to mention
7310000	7312000	and I just caught myself looking at it
7312000	7314000	so I have to say
7314000	7316000	on the iPhone there's this game called
7316000	7318000	Tiny Tower
7318000	7320000	I think a lot of people are playing this
7320000	7322000	but yeah I'm playing
7322000	7324000	Tiny Tower and I can't stop playing
7324000	7326000	this game and what it is
7326000	7328000	it's kind of like Sim Tower
7328000	7330000	dumbed down and what's really cute about
7330000	7332000	it is that all your characters are little 8-bit characters
7332000	7334000	you have this tower you can build
7334000	7336000	these different types of levels including
7336000	7338000	apartments that they live in and
7338000	7340000	you can take characters up and down the stairs
7340000	7342000	but what I love about this most is that if you go
7342000	7344000	on the menu there's this thing called BitBook
7344000	7346000	and you can look at what the citizens of
7346000	7348000	your tower are posting on their BitBooks
7348000	7350000	and let's see
7350000	7352000	like for instance I forgot to restock
7352000	7354000	the plant nursery for like a couple hours
7354000	7356000	because I'm doing this show so one of my people
7356000	7358000	wrote on BitBook came to work at the
7358000	7360000	plant nursery but no one is here
7360000	7362000	it's just things like that but one
7362000	7364000	the other day one of them wrote something like
7364000	7366000	we're going to have a party to celebrate
7366000	7368000	so and so moving in silly hats only
7368000	7370000	and that really cracked me up because it was a reference
7370000	7372000	to the cartoon Rejected
7372000	7374000	awesome anyhow yeah that's a free
7374000	7376000	game I've been playing the shit out of that because
7376000	7378000	you know the tower bucks are what cost
7378000	7380000	money but you don't need them to play the game
7380000	7382000	so that whole thing going on
7382000	7384000	alright anyhow
7384000	7386000	back to the Twitter
7386000	7388000	let's see going to the tweets
7388000	7390000	getting into some
7390000	7392000	twats here let's see
7392000	7394000	DJ Rama has tweeted
7394000	7396000	something that's going to come up in a little bit here
7396000	7398000	on the show I think yeah it's coming up a little later
7398000	7400000	so I can't read his tweet but let me go
7400000	7402000	to Spazinator got the ball
7402000	7404000	rolling on getting my PS3 fixed yesterday
7404000	7406000	just waiting on the coffin now
7406000	7408000	non-gaming news as of today
7408000	7410000	gay marriage is now legal in New York State
7410000	7412000	I think that's terrific and
7412000	7414000	I wish our state would catch up
7414000	7416000	I'm like it's not going to send
7416000	7418000	like a gay wave across
7418000	7420000	the nation I'm like
7420000	7422000	gay people are going to be in happy
7422000	7424000	committed stuff whether
7424000	7426000	you choose to acknowledge it legally or not
7426000	7428000	and when you don't acknowledge it legally that's called
7428000	7430000	discrimination I'm like it's as simple as that
7430000	7432000	like what are you going to accomplish
7432000	7434000	banning gay marriage
7434000	7436000	nothing
7436000	7438000	but by doing it you are
7438000	7440000	I could get into that
7440000	7442000	whole rant but it's just like
7442000	7444000	I think D. Snyder said it
7444000	7446000	best in a tweet this week yes I'm referring to
7446000	7448000	D. Snyder from what was
7448000	7450000	Twisted Sister he said
7450000	7452000	something like it's 2011
7452000	7454000	if you don't finally support gay marriage then
7454000	7456000	you're the problem
7456000	7458000	anyhow
7458000	7460000	that's how I feel if you don't agree with me deal with it
7460000	7462000	let's see
7462000	7464000	I can't remember if this
7464000	7466000	is coming up later or not I think I can
7466000	7468000	talk about this one if I'm
7468000	7470000	repeating a story coming up I apologize
7470000	7472000	S.J. 100 Matt tweeted us with a story about
7472000	7474000	Bobby Kotick
7474000	7476000	Bobby Kotick opened his mouth again to spew more trash
7476000	7478000	this week now he says DJ Hero was
7478000	7480000	a huge mistake
7480000	7482000	this is in an interview
7482000	7484000	with Forbes magazine
7484000	7486000	Bobby Kotick says DJ Hero was a
7486000	7488000	passion project
7488000	7490000	we should have said well how many people
7490000	7492000	really want to unleash their inner DJ
7492000	7494000	and then out of the people who do want to unleash
7494000	7496000	their inner DJ how many want to do it in the
7496000	7498000	context of a game where you earn points
7498000	7500000	versus just taking a DJ deck
7500000	7502000	or tools on their Mac and actually being
7502000	7504000	a DJ and it turns out it's a very
7504000	7506000	small market
7506000	7508000	and Bobby Kotick said that seeing DJ Hero
7508000	7510000	fail despite critical claim in the marketing
7510000	7512000	plan that pushed it down their throats was
7512000	7514000	one of the hardest failures for him
7514000	7516000	so there you go
7516000	7518000	and he also talks about Guitar Hero
7518000	7520000	and so on
7520000	7522000	quote it was very clear people didn't want more 80's heavy
7522000	7524000	metal music but what they wanted was
7524000	7526000	very difficult for us to get from the music companies
7526000	7528000	the number one thing
7528000	7530000	that our audiences wanted in Guitar Hero was
7530000	7532000	Led Zeppelin but we couldn't get Led Zeppelin
7532000	7534000	to consent to give us the rights
7534000	7536000	interesting so kind of blaming
7536000	7538000	the failure of Guitar Hero on the music
7538000	7540000	industry and maybe there's only
7540000	7542000	so many songs that people want to play
7542000	7544000	especially when you look at Rock Band
7544000	7546000	shit Rock Band has almost everything now
7546000	7548000	seems like
7548000	7550000	and I'm always wanting more
7550000	7552000	so
7552000	7554000	moving on to
7554000	7556000	other tweets
7556000	7558000	Zether77 tweets us saying
7558000	7560000	according to a YouTube video
7560000	7562000	Oppa Oppa is a hidden character in Planet Harriers
7562000	7564000	yes
7564000	7566000	but Oppa Oppa also makes appearances in levels
7566000	7568000	ahh I see
7568000	7570000	and somebody else I'm guessing is on his
7570000	7572000	friends list what is this
7572000	7574000	KeegeeKG responded to him
7574000	7576000	and said I've been wanting that for years
7576000	7578000	like since GameCube came out
7578000	7580000	so you're not alone in your Planet Harrier love
7580000	7582000	Planet Harriers is like
7582000	7584000	it did look pretty awesome
7584000	7586000	it did look pretty awesome from the video you showed me
7586000	7588000	I kind of wish I'd played that I had no idea that
7588000	7590000	it was at Great America I just somehow
7590000	7592000	overlooked that anyhow
7592000	7594000	Tiger Claw says this is a couple tweets one of them
7594000	7596000	is about Majora's Mask that's right
7596000	7598000	on the 3DS why not because
7598000	7600000	you know we had Zelda Ocarina of Time
7600000	7602000	on the 3DS why not
7602000	7604000	Majora's Mask
7604000	7606000	well in an interview with Nintendo
7606000	7608000	Power
7608000	7610000	E.G. Onoma who is
7610000	7612000	one of the folks behind Zelda
7612000	7614000	he says that
7614000	7616000	it's a possibility
7616000	7618000	and according to him in the interview here
7618000	7620000	quote it wouldn't be an utter
7620000	7622000	impossibility to see a remake
7622000	7624000	so
7624000	7626000	I guess they're saying that if fans demanded
7626000	7628000	it they would make it
7628000	7630000	oh so that you'll do
7630000	7632000	but oh the people wanting you to port
7632000	7634000	a simple game that's already been localized
7634000	7636000	nah you'll take a shit on them
7636000	7638000	yep
7638000	7640000	although I don't know I still think
7640000	7642000	Loki there's going to be a press conference
7642000	7644000	where it says the fans demanded it
7644000	7646000	of course they're going to and they're
7646000	7648000	going to come out looking like the heroes
7648000	7650000	look at those abs dude
7650000	7652000	oh on poison
7652000	7654000	look last tweet here
7654000	7656000	from Tiger Claw about Wesley
7656000	7658000	Snipes he has made a video game
7658000	7660000	from prison absolutely
7660000	7662000	right this is Julius
7662000	7664000	Styles the International it's a video
7664000	7666000	game that Wesley Snipes not to be
7666000	7668000	confused with Julius Styles that's right
7668000	7670000	Wesley Snipes by the way most famous for his
7670000	7672000	role in Tu Wong Fu thanks for everything
7672000	7674000	Julie Newmar
7674000	7676000	he was
7676000	7678000	he's developing the game in
7678000	7680000	prison and he's developed
7680000	7682000	he's teaming up with developer Lapland
7682000	7684000	so he's been I guess writing down his ideas
7684000	7686000	while he's in prison and it's a game that
7686000	7688000	combines action movie characters
7688000	7690000	like the type of character he played in
7690000	7692000	Blade and so forth into one
7692000	7694000	I guess character in a video game
7694000	7696000	I
7696000	7698000	guess the game is only coming out on
7698000	7700000	iPad and iPhone because
7700000	7702000	those are probably the easiest platforms to publish on
7702000	7704000	and we like criminals
7704000	7706000	there you go Julius Styles if you want to support
7706000	7708000	Wesley Snipes and help fund his legal fund
7708000	7710000	you can check out this game
7710000	7712000	that's it
7712000	7714000	for the Twitter tonight at Twitter.com
7714000	7716000	slash OLR hey we're just
7716000	7718000	about to tonight's list list I'm so
7718000	7720000	excited we haven't done one of these in forever and I thought
7720000	7722000	it's high time we do another game but first
7722000	7724000	another bout of news for you
7724000	7726000	ah yes
7726000	7728000	you know it's like
7728000	7730000	every other week we have a lawsuit against Zynga
7730000	7732000	or you know
7732000	7734000	even one week we had Zynga suing
7734000	7736000	someone else but no this week it's
7736000	7738000	actually a lawsuit against Zynga over Farmville
7738000	7740000	of course the source code
7740000	7742000	apparently a
7742000	7744000	California based web developer named
7744000	7746000	social apps
7746000	7748000	they decided to
7748000	7750000	sue Zynga because of alleged
7750000	7752000	copyright infringement in violation
7752000	7754000	of trade secrets breach of written
7754000	7756000	contract breach of implied in fact
7756000	7758000	contract and breach of
7758000	7760000	confidence
7760000	7762000	their argument is that they entered into
7762000	7764000	agreement with Zynga whereas in Zynga
7764000	7766000	would receive access to their source
7766000	7768000	code for social apps
7768000	7770000	for the social apps
7770000	7772000	Facebook game my farm in exchange
7772000	7774000	for some form of compensation
7774000	7776000	according to the suit
7776000	7778000	Zynga was given the code at which point they
7778000	7780000	fled into the night never to be heard
7780000	7782000	from again social apps
7782000	7784000	claims that my farm's source code
7784000	7786000	provided the foundation for
7786000	7788000	Farmville as well as its many
7788000	7790000	derivatives and they're seeking
7790000	7792000	permanent injunction damages
7792000	7794000	attorneys fees as well as
7794000	7796000	any of Zynga's
7796000	7798000	profits or gains which can be
7798000	7800000	attributed to Farmville
7800000	7802000	so at least we have a legal
7802000	7804000	story tonight that's not some patent
7804000	7806000	or something like that I mean this claim does
7806000	7808000	sound kind of interesting where
7808000	7810000	you know you had the game my farm
7810000	7812000	and they get it so they had my
7812000	7814000	farm they gave the source code to Zynga
7814000	7816000	and then Zynga
7816000	7818000	would get would give them money
7818000	7820000	that they never got is that what's that
7820000	7822000	essentially this is about um am I hearing
7822000	7824000	this right I guess but I
7824000	7826000	don't know why if you would let someone
7826000	7828000	look at your source code and expect them
7828000	7830000	not to steal it you know what I mean
7830000	7832000	I mean it's or use it in some
7832000	7834000	way I guess exactly why
7834000	7836000	would you want to do that what would be the point
7836000	7838000	well maybe Zynga had the idea on
7838000	7840000	how to get it out there I mean Zynga before they
7840000	7842000	put out Farmville weren't they already huge for
7842000	7844000	Mafia Wars I don't know
7844000	7846000	don't care so I could see
7846000	7848000	where maybe you're gonna take somebody else's game
7848000	7850000	and make it better and market it a little
7850000	7852000	better and then make tons of money
7852000	7854000	off of it but yeah you would owe them a piece of the
7854000	7856000	profits but of course we're only hearing one side
7856000	7858000	of this have we had an official response from Zynga yet
7858000	7860000	I guess not huh
7860000	7862000	nope all right
7862000	7864000	of course
7864000	7866000	again Zynga is one of those companies where it's like
7866000	7868000	it's really hard to root for them
7868000	7870000	haha
7870000	7872000	anyhow
7872000	7874000	xbox.com
7874000	7876000	we heard about this happening
7876000	7878000	before that games would soon
7878000	7880000	be a part of xbox.com
7880000	7882000	but now I guess with
7882000	7884000	games for windows you know now combining with
7884000	7886000	xbox.com there are four
7886000	7888000	free trial games that you can play
7888000	7890000	on the xbox 360 homepage
7890000	7892000	you can play them right in your browser
7892000	7894000	and you don't have to install them to your computer or anything
7894000	7896000	now the games that you can play
7896000	7898000	plants vs zombies
7898000	7900000	bejeweled 3, zuma's revenge
7900000	7902000	and text twist 2 which are all
7902000	7904000	pretty much popcap games or there's
7904000	7906000	stuff that sound right off of uh
7906000	7908000	um what is
7908000	7910000	it the uh zone
7910000	7912000	msn zone has been around forever and it had
7912000	7914000	all those games too and it's kinda weird that
7914000	7916000	microsoft hasn't brought that into the fold if they haven't already
7916000	7918000	does that still exist
7918000	7920000	I remember I had an account there like
7920000	7922000	forever ago
7922000	7924000	yeah zone msn.com still exists
7924000	7926000	I'm really surprised this isn't in the fold too
7926000	7928000	I mean these are like as casual as they get
7928000	7930000	games though
7930000	7932000	this is where you can play such winners as
7932000	7934000	bubbles you play them in your sleep
7934000	7936000	that's casual and patchworks
7936000	7938000	and fishdom
7938000	7940000	spooky splash
7940000	7942000	but you can also play
7942000	7944000	bejeweled 3 on there so it's
7944000	7946000	pretty interesting I don't know
7946000	7948000	but yeah there you go uh those games are now
7948000	7950000	playable free on xbox.com
7950000	7952000	maybe a sign of things to come
7952000	7954000	I don't know I bet people would be a lot more interested
7954000	7956000	if you could earn achievements in those games
7956000	7958000	and I'm totally serious when I say that by the way
7958000	7960000	totally serious
7960000	7962000	alright one more story till we get to list list tonight
7962000	7964000	Dark Sakura
7964000	7966000	well how about
7966000	7968000	something that
7968000	7970000	I had to make sure that it wasn't a joke when I
7970000	7972000	first saw it
7972000	7974000	the com is announcing street fighter vs hello kitty
7974000	7976000	I'm not joking
7976000	7978000	wait what?
7978000	7980000	fall 2012 street fighter and hello kitty
7980000	7982000	will have a single game together
7982000	7984000	so I could like play as bats maru
7984000	7986000	and like kick ihonda's ass
7986000	7988000	I guess but they
7988000	7990000	put up a picture of
7990000	7992000	kitty dressed up as chun li
7992000	7994000	it was like just a flash
7994000	7996000	on the screen
7996000	7998000	and uh
7998000	8000000	there's nothing else you know really
8000000	8002000	about it but the quote says
8002000	8004000	that this is from Joshua Izzo
8004000	8006000	who's the director of licensing with capcom
8006000	8008000	capcom has long admired Sanrio
8008000	8010000	and their ability to create memorable
8010000	8012000	and cherished lifestyle brands so it is
8012000	8014000	a distinct pleasure to partner with them for this
8014000	8016000	new crossover line of merchandise
8016000	8018000	so it looks like it's just merchandise really
8018000	8020000	yeah it's just like handbags
8020000	8022000	and wallets could you imagine them doing
8022000	8024000	pocket fighter with Sanrio characters
8024000	8026000	that would be weird
8026000	8028000	that would be kind of weird but funny
8028000	8030000	that's kind of cute
8030000	8032000	I don't know like there's a part of me
8032000	8034000	like when I first heard this story I was like
8034000	8036000	no way are they making a game and then I heard it was
8036000	8038000	the merchandising and I'm like that is really
8038000	8040000	weird and I see the picture of hello kitty as chun
8040000	8042000	li and I'm like what in the actual
8042000	8044000	fuck is this and why do I still
8044000	8046000	really want it? I want a bats maru
8046000	8048000	done up as gulkey
8048000	8050000	I think bats maru would probably get the ryu
8050000	8052000	treatment I think that's what I'm gonna see
8052000	8054000	no dear daniel would you think? I think
8054000	8056000	we'll see
8056000	8058000	but I love this chun li kitty it's so adorable
8058000	8060000	I want that
8060000	8062000	alright
8062000	8064000	anyhow let's get to listless
8064000	8066000	I'm so excited we haven't done a
8066000	8068000	game here on OLR in a long time so let's
8068000	8070000	let's do listless
8072000	8074000	tonight we are going to create the
8074000	8076000	definitive list on a particular
8076000	8078000	topic in gaming and
8078000	8080000	here's the way that listless works we're gonna all
8080000	8082000	go around in studio and I'm gonna bring on
8082000	8084000	a guest on the phone here in a moment and we're
8084000	8086000	each gonna bring up our list of three
8086000	8088000	possible choices to put on
8088000	8090000	the list but then the difficult part we all
8090000	8092000	go around and eliminate one from
8092000	8094000	the list that will leave us with a list of eight
8094000	8096000	possible answers for the
8096000	8098000	topic and then you guys
8098000	8100000	in the chat room will get to vote on your number
8100000	8102000	one and number two picks so our
8102000	8104000	list combined with your votes create the
8104000	8106000	definitive list
8106000	8108000	for this topic and there's no argue this is a highly
8108000	8110000	scientific process there's no arguing
8110000	8112000	this is what the fans want
8112000	8114000	alright so I bet you all are
8114000	8116000	dying to know tonight's topic
8116000	8118000	well earlier tonight we talked about
8118000	8120000	Freddy Krueger being in Mortal Kombat
8120000	8122000	so now it's pretty clear that Mortal Kombat
8122000	8124000	is clearly adding whatever character
8124000	8126000	they want doesn't even have to be
8126000	8128000	in the Mortal Kombat mythos
8128000	8130000	so what character should
8130000	8132000	be next
8132000	8134000	that's right Mortal Kombat
8134000	8136000	is adding characters so what character
8136000	8138000	should be next let me bring on
8138000	8140000	a fourth panelist tonight
8140000	8142000	now I have to admit I was trying to get
8142000	8144000	Extifer tonight because
8144000	8146000	it would have been fun and I know he plays the Mortal Kombat
8146000	8148000	series but unfortunately he
8148000	8150000	had to bow out so he's
8150000	8152000	not going to be able to be on the show tonight he was getting
8152000	8154000	his asshole bleached
8154000	8156000	exactly exactly
8156000	8158000	right so he couldn't join us
8158000	8160000	but I got a substitute that
8160000	8162000	tends to substitute for Extifer over
8162000	8164000	on Horde House as well when needed so
8164000	8166000	here
8166000	8170000	here we go I'm going to give him a call right now
8170000	8172000	one ringy dingy
8172000	8174000	hopefully it rings I don't know
8174000	8176000	here we go hello hello
8176000	8178000	hey slices pop hey what's up
8178000	8180000	hey not much welcome to Orange Laundry

8184000	8186000	up in here with you I'm sort of on the show
8186000	8188000	less than when I was when I lived in the bay

8190000	8192000	tonight you're welcome to come over whenever you want
8192000	8194000	filling in for Extifer sort of
8194000	8196000	that's who I was trying to get for this segment tonight
8196000	8198000	but just like on Horde House you are saving the day
8198000	8200000	so I appreciate it
8200000	8202000	now usually we have guests
8202000	8204000	we usually have guests on here to plug
8204000	8206000	websites or
8206000	8208000	their own podcast
8208000	8210000	is there anything you want to plug tonight?
8210000	8212000	I was
8212000	8214000	also the guest commentator
8214000	8216000	on the most recent episode of
8216000	8218000	Horde House for WoW discussion if anyone cares
8218000	8220000	about that but otherwise not really
8220000	8222000	no I hate WoW and I hate Horde House it's a bad
8222000	8224000	show
8224000	8226000	you should probably stop producing it
8226000	8228000	because you're one of the co-hosts
8228000	8230000	alright let's get
8230000	8232000	to tonight's list
8232000	8234000	alright so you've already been briefed on the
8234000	8236000	topic at hand so everybody here in studio
8236000	8238000	should have their and on the phone should have their
8238000	8240000	top three answers now that Mortal Combat
8240000	8242000	is clearly adding whatever character they
8242000	8244000	want what character should be next
8244000	8246000	now we're also relying on those of you
8246000	8248000	in chat to give your answers
8248000	8250000	because if one of us has an item
8250000	8252000	to get duplicated on the list or something
8252000	8254000	where we don't want to say the same thing twice
8254000	8256000	we often turn to chat to help us
8256000	8258000	out so chat.orangelandradio.com
8258000	8260000	if you want to give your opinions
8260000	8262000	so let's start forming the list and we'll
8262000	8264000	let ladies go first
8264000	8266000	so DarkSakura what is your number three
8266000	8268000	answer? What character should be in
8268000	8270000	Mortal Combat next?
8270000	8272000	Ash from
8272000	8274000	Evil Dead
8274000	8276000	Ash from Evil Dead?
8276000	8278000	Could you imagine how awesome that would be?
8278000	8280000	Weren't there always rumors
8280000	8282000	of like an Ash versus Freddy versus
8282000	8284000	Jason movie? There was
8284000	8286000	yeah and he actually did a comic
8286000	8288000	of Army
8288000	8290000	of Darkness versus Marvel Zombies
8290000	8292000	and he was in it. Interesting
8292000	8294000	yeah so
8294000	8296000	not out of the entire realm of possibility
8296000	8298000	of Ash being in a fight again. And you know Bruce
8298000	8300000	Campbell likes money. Yeah of course
8300000	8302000	alright I'll go next
8302000	8304000	I'm going to say my number three answer is
8304000	8306000	Barney the purple dinosaur
8306000	8308000	this is my number three answer
8308000	8310000	because who doesn't want to
8310000	8312000	perform a fatality on Barney?
8312000	8314000	I love you
8314000	8316000	you love me
8316000	8318000	let's go and beat up Barney
8318000	8320000	with a baseball bat
8320000	8322000	we'll knock him to the floor
8322000	8324000	no more purple dinosaur
8324000	8326000	there you go I'll never sing again on this program
8326000	8328000	ladies and gentlemen
8328000	8330000	Barney the purple dinosaur
8330000	8332000	is he even on TV anymore?
8332000	8334000	I think so
8334000	8336000	alright
8336000	8338000	are you a big fan of Barney Slice of Pop?
8338000	8340000	I have two half
8340000	8342000	brothers that are significantly younger than me
8342000	8344000	and they were toddlers during the
8344000	8346000	early and mid 90s which was when
8346000	8348000	Barney the dinosaur ruled the fucking world
8348000	8350000	so yeah my
8350000	8352000	16 year old ass had to sit at home
8352000	8354000	and watch those VHS tapes 20
8354000	8356000	30 times in a day. So how do you feel
8356000	8358000	how do you feel about Barney Immortal Combat?
8358000	8360000	There's some trauma there. I think I
8360000	8362000	could get out my
8362000	8364000	PTSD my post-traumatic
8364000	8366000	stress disorder by killing him
8366000	8368000	in Mortal Combat from my teenage
8368000	8370000	years I would be a fan of that
8370000	8372000	alright awesome
8372000	8374000	Loki we'll go to you next. What's your number 3 answer?
8374000	8376000	My number 3 answer
8376000	8378000	Colonel Sanders
8382000	8384000	Why the man from KFC?
8384000	8386000	It would be hilarious. It reminds me of
8386000	8388000	Project Aco
8388000	8390000	It's the Colonel
8390000	8392000	I love it
8392000	8394000	Alright
8394000	8396000	Slice of Pop, your number 3 answer
8398000	8400000	This might be a little bit
8400000	8402000	obscure but for those who remember
8402000	8404000	the Spawn comic
8404000	8406000	Spawn from the 90s, Angela
8406000	8408000	Angela from Spawn
8408000	8410000	Oh
8410000	8412000	She's got the
8412000	8414000	TNA and she's got the brutality
8414000	8416000	so I think she'd be a great fit
8416000	8418000	Slice of Pop taking it serious
8418000	8420000	I like this. Angela from the Spawn comics
8420000	8422000	a very serious answer that I'm sure will not
8422000	8424000	survive the elimination round but we'll see what happens
8424000	8426000	I'm just kidding. Tell us a little more about
8426000	8428000	Angela for those that aren't familiar with the comics
8428000	8430000	and I didn't see that movie either
8430000	8432000	Uh
8432000	8434000	Spawn was a demon from hell
8434000	8436000	after this alien sort of
8436000	8438000	usurped Lucifer from hell
8438000	8440000	and he was kind of, so Spawn was a demon
8440000	8442000	Angela was this badass angel
8442000	8444000	from heaven except she would
8444000	8446000	fucking kill you. She was you know brutal
8446000	8448000	it wasn't a very feathers
8448000	8450000	and wings and pretty choir
8450000	8452000	angels with halos. She was
8452000	8454000	she was really a
8454000	8456000	force to be reckoned with so I
8456000	8458000	definitely think she could kick some ass in Mortal Combat
8458000	8460000	Alright, excellent. Alright, let's see if
8460000	8462000	it survives. We've got more to
8462000	8464000	go though. Those are the number 3 answers
8464000	8466000	Ash from Evil Dead, Barney the Purple
8466000	8468000	Dinosaur, Colonel Sanders and Angela from the
8468000	8470000	Spawn comics. Let's go to the number 2s
8470000	8472000	Dark Soccer, your number 2 answer
8472000	8474000	Um, Pyramid Head
8474000	8476000	Pyramid Head
8476000	8478000	from Silent Hill. Need I ask
8478000	8480000	why? No you don't need to
8480000	8482000	I could
8482000	8484000	ask but then I might end up dead right?
8484000	8486000	He's badass
8486000	8488000	and that's actually a serious suggestion. Alright
8488000	8490000	that's a good answer. Pyramid
8490000	8492000	Head is on the list there. I saw that in chat
8492000	8494000	and actually when I saw it go by in chat
8494000	8496000	Zethur in chat suggested when I saw that I was like
8496000	8498000	oh I'm taking that one if one of mine gets stolen
8498000	8500000	but since now
8500000	8502000	it's already on the list I'll use my original number
8502000	8504000	2 answer which I'm sorry this
8504000	8506000	would be badass and this should absolutely
8506000	8508000	be in Mortal Kombat and
8508000	8510000	who is a
8510000	8512000	character? I'm going to ask this question
8512000	8514000	Who is a character more scary
8514000	8516000	than Freddy Krueger and Jason
8516000	8518000	combined? Who is the scariest
8518000	8520000	fucking character ever in the history of ever?
8520000	8522000	My mother pissed off? No
8522000	8524000	Pennywise the Clown
8524000	8526000	Oh my god
8526000	8528000	And that's my number 2 answer. Pennywise
8528000	8530000	the Clown. I am afraid of clowns
8530000	8532000	and I really hate that clown
8532000	8534000	So don't you want to kill one?
8534000	8536000	Well Shang Tsung turned into
8536000	8538000	Well you know Shang Tsung's clown fatality
8538000	8540000	was supposed to be Joker's fatality
8540000	8542000	Oh wow
8542000	8544000	In the DC vs. Mortal Kombat
8544000	8546000	It was the fatality
8546000	8548000	But
8548000	8550000	No it was supposed to be they changed it
8550000	8552000	No it's exactly the same as the fatality
8552000	8554000	that Joker used in
8554000	8556000	Because he wasn't supposed to actually shoot him
8556000	8558000	Yeah well it goes off camera
8558000	8560000	Yeah it goes off camera but
8560000	8562000	but you see the whole thing in
8562000	8564000	Mortal Kombat Alright
8564000	8566000	So there you go. Pennywise the Clown from IT
8566000	8568000	Alright
8568000	8570000	Loki what's your number 2 answer?
8570000	8572000	My number 2 answer is the most
8572000	8574000	frightening thing beyond Pennywise
8574000	8576000	the Clown
8576000	8578000	that is just hit media
8578000	8580000	all together and that would be Lady Gaga
8584000	8586000	If anyone deserves to be torn apart
8586000	8588000	as strange as fucking hell is Lady Gaga
8588000	8590000	Hey! Hey!
8590000	8592000	You could do some Ermac and some Noob Saibot
8592000	8594000	fucking crazy morphing shit with those costumes
8594000	8596000	of hers You could it would be costume
8596000	8598000	morphing and like her costumes would be like
8598000	8600000	those bubble dresses would be filled
8600000	8602000	with acid and shit like I would play as
8602000	8604000	Lady Gaga and I would beat your ass
8604000	8606000	I would shove a 9 inch
8606000	8608000	stiletto in your characters eye
8608000	8610000	For the record Becky said she jumped when you said Pennywise
8612000	8614000	I'm telling you Pennywise is a scary
8614000	8616000	mother fucker Alright there you go
8616000	8618000	Lady Gaga. Oh I love this
8618000	8620000	DDR dollar villain chat suggests Pennywise
8620000	8622000	turns into a giant spider for a fatality
8622000	8624000	That's good
8624000	8626000	Alright
8626000	8628000	Uh, Salacious Pop it's over to you
8628000	8630000	What's your number 2 answer?
8630000	8632000	So the key question to this list list
8632000	8634000	is characters
8634000	8636000	and not people so
8636000	8638000	I'm saying Rose mother fucking Nylund
8638000	8640000	from the Golden Girls
8640000	8642000	Betty White
8642000	8644000	Rose Nylund
8644000	8646000	Rose Nylund
8646000	8648000	She'll kill you
8648000	8650000	And
8650000	8652000	what would Rose Nylund's fatality be
8652000	8654000	would it be a story from St. Olaf
8654000	8656000	Yes she'd tell us St. Olaf story
8656000	8658000	and you would take a shotgun and you would kill yourself
8658000	8660000	Alright
8660000	8662000	I always
8662000	8664000	Hey I always wanted my
8664000	8666000	Golden Girls game that was Grandma Got Guns
8666000	8668000	and it was about the Golden Girls just going on
8668000	8670000	a rampage to save their retirement
8670000	8672000	home or whatever. Alright so Rose Nylund
8672000	8674000	is uh
8674000	8676000	Salacious Pop's number 2 answer. Alright here it is
8676000	8678000	time for the number 1 answers
8678000	8680000	and we're gonna go around and get them
8680000	8682000	Let me read the list so far
8682000	8684000	Ash from Evil Dead, Barney the Purple Dinosaur
8684000	8686000	Colonel Sanders, Angela from Spawn, Pyramid Head
8686000	8688000	Pennywise the Clown from IT
8688000	8690000	Lady Gaga and Rose Nylund
8690000	8692000	who is of course Betty White from the Golden Girls
8692000	8694000	Alright so now it's time to get the number 1
8694000	8696000	answers. Dark Sakura
8696000	8698000	I went serious with all my answers you know
8698000	8700000	I picked Sera Pizzini
8700000	8702000	Witchblade
8702000	8704000	You gotta spell that last name for me
8704000	8706000	I was thinking of her
8706000	8708000	when Rob told me what Luke was
8708000	8710000	ZZINI
8710000	8712000	Okay P-I-Z-Z-I-N-I I don't know this character
8712000	8714000	either you gotta explain this to me a little bit
8714000	8716000	The Witchblade basically is like this
8716000	8718000	gauntlet that's stuck on one hand but it
8718000	8720000	will turn into any weapons and the armor
8720000	8722000	so she's like wearing like this big metal ball
8722000	8724000	but she's all coated in the weapon
8724000	8726000	Alright
8726000	8728000	I think the Elts got like half of it and now there's
8728000	8730000	a new Witchblade and I kind of got
8730000	8732000	out of it around then but there was also
8732000	8734000	a cool
8734000	8736000	Battle of the Planets crossover where
8736000	8738000	and keep in mind
8738000	8740000	I know all the Gachamon names so I think in
8740000	8742000	Battle of the Planet it's just called Princess
8742000	8744000	Whoever Jun the Swan was in Gachamon
8744000	8746000	She got the Witchblade so it was a
8746000	8748000	neat kind of crossover but other than that
8748000	8750000	you know I think that
8750000	8752000	I just always liked the character so
8752000	8754000	she'd be badass
8754000	8756000	I'm gonna get to my number one answer
8756000	8758000	My number one answer is also a very serious answer
8758000	8760000	like I really think and Salacious Pop might be mad
8760000	8762000	at me because I have a feeling this could be who he's thinking
8762000	8764000	too so I apologize in advance
8764000	8766000	if this is your answer Salacious Pop but I have to say
8766000	8768000	a character I would honestly love to see
8768000	8770000	in Mortal Kombat that would kick a lot of ass
8770000	8772000	would be Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill
8772000	8774000	Hell yeah!
8774000	8776000	That was of course
8776000	8778000	Uma Thermos character in Kill Bill
8778000	8780000	Was that your answer Salacious Pop?
8780000	8782000	Well um I was gonna
8782000	8784000	say uh
8784000	8786000	she's the best character
8786000	8788000	in the whole thing and I can't
8788000	8790000	Daryl Hannah who did she play?
8790000	8792000	Oh um
8792000	8794000	Black Mamba
8794000	8796000	No Black Mamba was Beatrix
8796000	8798000	She was California
8798000	8800000	King Snake but the character was
8800000	8802000	L Driver
8802000	8804000	Was that your number one really?
8804000	8806000	No no I was going to but I'm gonna switch something else now
8806000	8808000	because Beatrix is better
8808000	8810000	Alright so there it is Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill
8810000	8812000	How could I not? I'm just like
8812000	8814000	my god she kicks so much ass
8814000	8816000	I would hate to see her die but at the same time
8816000	8818000	she's gonna just chop bitches arms off and so forth
8818000	8820000	so there you go Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill
8820000	8822000	is my number one answer
8822000	8824000	Loki your number one answer
8824000	8826000	My number one answer
8826000	8828000	unfortunately he is
8828000	8830000	he has passed but uh
8830000	8832000	Billy Mays
8834000	8836000	Billy Mays hi guys
8836000	8838000	Billy Mays here
8838000	8840000	Would he actually show off something
8840000	8842000	in his infomercial before killing you with it?
8842000	8844000	He would throw OxiClean on you
8844000	8846000	He would die
8846000	8848000	He would spray you with OxiClean and then start
8848000	8850000	scrubbing away until your face came off
8850000	8852000	There you go there you go
8852000	8854000	Alright Billy Mays

9040000	9042000	there you go alright
9042000	9044000	so
9044000	9046000	now is the time where we eliminate things from
9046000	9048000	the list I know this is going to be very difficult but unfortunately
9048000	9050000	some items are going to have to come
9050000	9052000	off the list so here we go
9052000	9054000	insulation pop I posted it to you in a
9054000	9056000	private message so you can follow along here
9056000	9058000	um Dark Sakura
9058000	9060000	this is hard these are all good answers tonight
9060000	9062000	we don't often have this in list list
9062000	9064000	usually like there's a couple shitty ones on there but these are
9064000	9066000	all good but unfortunately
9066000	9068000	this is a scientific process and for the scientific
9068000	9070000	process to continue something
9070000	9072000	must come off the list Dark Sakura which of these
9072000	9074000	is not worthy of the list I would have to say
9074000	9076000	Barney because I find him even more
9076000	9078000	traumatic than anything else in the
9078000	9080000	universe and just I wouldn't
9080000	9082000	be able to fight him because I would have to pause
9082000	9084000	the game and go throw up alright Barney
9084000	9086000	the purple dinosaur has been stricken from the list
9086000	9088000	uh I am going to remove
9088000	9090000	I'm sorry I do think this is a great idea
9090000	9092000	but it's just a little too crazy
9092000	9094000	I'm taking Billy Mays off the list
9094000	9096000	Billy Mays is not worthy of the list so it has been stricken
9096000	9098000	from the list Loki which of these is not
9098000	9100000	worthy of the list?
9100000	9102000	unfortunately it's not the
9102000	9104000	golden girl I would have picked so
9104000	9106000	Rose Nylund has to be removed off the list
9106000	9108000	Bea Arthur was a close second
9108000	9110000	Bea Arthur is a bad ass bitch
9110000	9112000	you should have just went with Maude
9112000	9114000	and then there's Maude
9114000	9116000	I have to
9116000	9118000	share this with you do you ever watch the
9118000	9120000	Deadpool PSAs? No
9120000	9122000	Deadpool had a minor obsession
9122000	9124000	with Bea Arthur, ok a major obsession with Bea Arthur
9124000	9126000	and it had a poster in the
9126000	9128000	the thing that said don't you wish your girlfriend was
9128000	9130000	hot like Bea
9130000	9132000	yes alright
9132000	9134000	so Rose Nylund has been stricken from the list
9134000	9136000	so nine items
9136000	9138000	remain Salacious Pop it comes down to you
9138000	9140000	one of these must come off the list for us to proceed
9140000	9142000	which of these is not worthy of the list Salacious Pop?
9142000	9144000	Pennywise the
9144000	9146000	clown
9146000	9148000	why that was the best answer on there
9148000	9150000	and I'm saying that because I'm totally biased
9150000	9152000	why are you getting rid of Pennywise?
9152000	9154000	Warner Brothers ain't trying to bring class action
9154000	9156000	lawsuits at people just you know

9158000	9160000	cause that's some traumatic shit
9160000	9162000	however wouldn't it have been cool to actually get Tim Curry to voice him
9162000	9164000	I know right
9164000	9166000	or just have Tim Curry
9166000	9168000	I'm so angry

9174000	9176000	alright
9176000	9178000	Tigerclaw says

9180000	9182000	Mortal Kombat his little intro animation
9182000	9184000	would be him showing up and saying okay

9320000	9322000	go over to Loki
9322000	9324000	with some news about GameCube games
9324000	9326000	yes apparently Nintendo director of
9326000	9328000	entertainment and trend marketing Amber
9328000	9330000	McCollum
9330000	9332000	was quoted
9332000	9334000	during an interview with
9334000	9336000	Nintendo Gal on the subject
9336000	9338000	of GameCube games not being playable on the upcoming
9338000	9340000	Wii U
9340000	9342000	McCollum said GameCube disc
9342000	9344000	will not be compatible with the Wii U
9344000	9346000	but a number of games that were
9346000	9348000	playable on the GameCube can be downloaded
9348000	9350000	from WiiWare
9350000	9352000	and people were like really
9352000	9354000	is that going to be possible
9354000	9356000	are you going to be able to download games
9356000	9358000	via some sort of storage device
9358000	9360000	or something like that
9360000	9362000	of course when asked to clarify
9362000	9364000	that statement
9364000	9366000	they went and said to clarify the
9366000	9368000	capabilities of the Wii U system
9368000	9370000	as correctly stated the Wii U will not be able to
9370000	9372000	play Nintendo GameCube disc
9372000	9374000	however Nintendo has not made any announcement
9374000	9376000	regarding download content so they kind of
9376000	9378000	back stepped a little bit but it sounds
9378000	9380000	like that maybe that's something
9380000	9382000	that they're going to be working towards
9382000	9384000	is having GameCube games downloadable
9386000	9388000	do you think that will really happen
9388000	9390000	because it would seem to be like the
9390000	9392000	GameCube games are kind of large but then again
9392000	9394000	we have Xbox 360 games and so forth
9394000	9396000	I'm not sure if they would do that
9396000	9398000	I think if anything they would just re-release
9398000	9400000	GameCube games or touch
9400000	9402000	them up somewhat and
9402000	9404000	re-release them on like they were doing
9404000	9406000	the new play control stuff where it was on a Wii disc
9406000	9408000	but it was a GameCube game I could see more
9408000	9410000	of that happening right
9410000	9412000	because it gives them an excuse to charge more money
9412000	9414000	and I would gladly pay for
9414000	9416000	F-Zero GX all over again though to be honest
9416000	9418000	I'm not even going to lie like take my money
9418000	9420000	I would gladly pay you tomorrow for a hamburger
9420000	9422000	today you be quiet
9422000	9424000	alright moving on
9424000	9426000	to a story about iRAM
9426000	9428000	do you know the company iRAM have you ever heard of iRAM?
9428000	9430000	Breaking R-Type! Hello! That's right they made R-Type
9430000	9432000	they made a lot of other interesting games too
9432000	9434000	but here's the deal
9434000	9436000	R-Type there's a few of these games on the PSP
9436000	9438000	like there's R-Type Tactics on the PSP
9438000	9440000	R-Type Tactics 2
9440000	9442000	there's also the game Archives have
9442000	9444000	R-Types and R-Types Delta these are all over the
9444000	9446000	Playstation Network and Playstation Go
9446000	9448000	well guess what? Come August 11
9448000	9450000	these games are going away
9450000	9452000	iRAM is taking their catalog off of the
9452000	9454000	Playstation Network and
9454000	9456000	the same thing goes for their specific Playstation
9456000	9458000	home lounges
9458000	9460000	they had some like I guess 9 lounges
9460000	9462000	that were about these games
9462000	9464000	they are all going away
9464000	9466000	I guess the Doki Doki Suikoden
9466000	9468000	lounge is the only one that's staying
9468000	9470000	I don't know
9470000	9472000	so yeah iRAM has not said why
9472000	9474000	they're going away but these games
9474000	9476000	on PSP are no longer going to be available
9476000	9478000	now a lot of these I've never heard of
9478000	9480000	there's games like these are all very
9480000	9482000	Japanese titles
9482000	9484000	2 based on cartoon cone
9484000	9486000	bumpy trot beagle battle tournament
9486000	9488000	these are all games that are downloadable right now
9488000	9490000	on Playstation Network they are going to be going away
9490000	9492000	on August 11th I wonder if this is
9492000	9494000	some type of retaliation
9494000	9496000	so to speak for the PSN being down
9496000	9498000	for so long
9498000	9500000	I don't know nah it's probably just licensing
9500000	9502000	coming up and they decided not to renew it
9502000	9504000	or something gotcha
9504000	9506000	alright well there you go
9506000	9508000	they are coming off of Playstation Network
9508000	9510000	so enjoy them while you can not like I can't bust
9510000	9512000	out you know the master system
9512000	9514000	and play art type the original system right

9536000	9538000	give Rob your sodium yes
9538000	9540000	greetings OLR thanks
9540000	9542000	for helping my commute to work a more pleasant one
9542000	9544000	with your podcast I really
9544000	9546000	find this debate of online passes and used
9546000	9548000	games quite interesting a long time gamer like
9548000	9550000	yourselves I actually
9550000	9552000	I am actually quite indifferent about
9552000	9554000	this tactic I do buy most of my games
9554000	9556000	new like Rob though I do dabble
9556000	9558000	in the occasional used title here and there as well
9558000	9560000	while I am not foolish enough to believe that
9560000	9562000	every used game equals a lost new game
9562000	9564000	sale it would be equally foolish to
9564000	9566000	assume that new game sales aren't somewhat
9566000	9568000	hurt by the used game market
9568000	9570000	frankly I don't buy the whole spin about
9570000	9572000	online passes being for servers or what not
9572000	9574000	it's simply a way to be able to
9574000	9576000	get a piece of the used game market for publishers
9576000	9578000	that being said I have no problem
9578000	9580000	with that being a pitfall of buying a
9580000	9582000	used game everything is included
9582000	9584000	with a new purchase so I will
9584000	9586000	always have and
9586000	9588000	more often than not choose that
9588000	9590000	option the harsh reality is
9590000	9592000	that game makers and publishers
9592000	9594000	owe nothing to used game purchasers because it
9594000	9596000	doesn't make them any money directly
9596000	9598000	I know that this
9598000	9600000	slippery slope argument exists
9600000	9602000	at the same time I give consumers more credit
9602000	9604000	than Loki may that they can look at each
9604000	9606000	issue on a case by case basis and reject
9606000	9608000	ideas that they feel cross the line
9608000	9610000	I have often wondered if there could be
9610000	9612000	a moratorium on used game sales
9612000	9614000	placed for maybe 3 or 6 months
9614000	9616000	so that new games aren't hindered by used
9616000	9618000	game sales at the end of the day
9618000	9620000	both used games and new games have their place
9620000	9622000	for now and I can't begrudge anyone
9622000	9624000	for choosing what solution works for them
9624000	9626000	thanks to all of you darkcharger
9626000	9628000	PS if the show is interested in
9628000	9630000	a new copy of Adobe Lightroom 3
9630000	9632000	yes
9632000	9634000	Jamie is
9634000	9636000	yes email
9636000	9638000	me and I will send it to you as a gift
9638000	9640000	thanks again for the podcast I wish that
9640000	9642000	I could listen live more often
9642000	9644000	yes
9644000	9646000	saved
9646000	9648000	I think
9648000	9650000	the idea is interesting about the whole moratorium
9650000	9652000	but I just don't think it's possible
9652000	9654000	because you'd be telling people they can't
9654000	9656000	sell their own new product
9656000	9658000	like what's to stop me from
9658000	9660000	going to my neighbor saying oh yeah you want this game
9660000	9662000	I don't really play it here give me 40 bucks
9662000	9664000	it would never happen because you're basically telling people
9664000	9666000	that when they're done with their game that they can't trade it
9666000	9668000	back into I mean okay let's say that they're able
9668000	9670000	to sell it back to GameStop but GameStop's not gonna sell
9670000	9672000	they're not gonna sit on a bunch of
9672000	9674000	product that's gonna be devaluing
9674000	9676000	you know over time especially when they're
9676000	9678000	taking trades in on games you know to
9678000	9680000	see that's the thing
9680000	9682000	is they use game sales
9682000	9684000	it gets people to trade in their games
9684000	9686000	to like a GameStop or something like that so they
9686000	9688000	buy those new games that you
9688000	9690000	want them to buy
9690000	9692000	but now if you take that money source
9692000	9694000	away I guess of them
9694000	9696000	if you basically ban used game
9696000	9698000	sales or make it not very
9698000	9700000	pretty to the fact that
9700000	9702000	it devalues the used game
9702000	9704000	then they're not gonna have money to
9704000	9706000	buy that new game that you want
9706000	9708000	to buy so you see you're in turn
9708000	9710000	hurting yourself
9710000	9712000	but they won't figure that out until
9712000	9714000	everyone jumps on board with this type of
9714000	9716000	you know scheme
9716000	9718000	and then it affects them down
9718000	9720000	the line and they're like ah crap
9720000	9722000	why did we do that?
9724000	9726000	You know and I'm kind of
9726000	9728000	in the boat as this guy I mean he already said he's
9728000	9730000	kind of like me where you either buy it new or you don't buy it
9730000	9732000	and especially considering what I talked about at the
9732000	9734000	top of the show as in one particular store I will
9734000	9736000	not be shopping at anymore for new or used games
9736000	9738000	I mean there's your biggest used market right
9738000	9740000	there but not
9740000	9742000	to say I would never buy a game used I mean there's
9742000	9744000	obviously other people trying to get in that market as well
9744000	9746000	but honestly I find now
9746000	9748000	by the time I want to go back
9748000	9750000	and get an old game and
9750000	9752000	I'd be actually looking for it used cause you usually can't
9752000	9754000	find the new game used it's so hard
9754000	9756000	to get it like I think the last
9756000	9758000	new game that I bought used was the Tron
9758000	9760000	game and I
9760000	9762000	the minute I played it I could see why somebody sold it
9762000	9764000	back right away so usually
9764000	9766000	you know if a game's really that good you can't
9766000	9768000	find it used right away
9768000	9770000	we go buy used games though fairly
9770000	9772000	regularly but that's just
9772000	9774000	because we might want to finish a collection
9774000	9776000	but I think at this point if I did want to
9776000	9778000	go get a used game I would just check the price on
9778000	9780000	Amazon or you know other competing
9780000	9782000	internet websites like Best Buy or whatever
9782000	9784000	and see what the price is and if it's
9784000	9786000	good enough I'll just buy it online
9786000	9788000	so
9788000	9790000	until one of those stores pisses me off
9790000	9792000	then I'll stop shopping there too
9792000	9794000	alright next email
9794000	9796000	hello olr
9796000	9798000	here's an orange lounge foodie-o question
9798000	9800000	but it does relate to a video game do you think
9800000	9802000	dominos will ever bring back the noid
9802000	9804000	we need a new yo noid
9804000	9806000	game dammit
9806000	9808000	brought to you by sizzler
9808000	9810000	home of the 3 day old salad bar that tastes like shit
9810000	9812000	and gives you the shit the squits
9812000	9814000	that's from chiggers
9814000	9816000	who by the way did get his name from where you thought
9816000	9818000	ewww
9818000	9820000	he said he had it as a kid or something like that
9820000	9822000	and that's where he got his name
9822000	9824000	I either
9824000	9826000	he emailed horde house about that or I ran into him
9826000	9828000	on wow and we brought that up
9828000	9830000	let's see
9830000	9832000	do I think dominos would ever bring back the noid
9832000	9834000	no dominos did this really interesting
9834000	9836000	thing where they kind of came out and admitted that their pizza
9836000	9838000	tastes like shit and that they're going to totally
9838000	9840000	redo it like it was this very interesting
9840000	9842000	campaign that they did and it worked
9842000	9844000	like dominos sales have been up quite a bit
9844000	9846000	in the past year or so people like that
9846000	9848000	self deprecating sense of humor and I think
9848000	9850000	because of that because dominos is trying to distance
9850000	9852000	themselves from the past you're not going to see the
9852000	9854000	noid ever come back I think the noid is something that's very
9854000	9856000	80's well never
9856000	9858000	say never but you're not going to see it in the next
9858000	9860000	5 years no so
9860000	9862000	sadly that would mean the same for the yo noid
9862000	9864000	game here's a question for you guys though
9864000	9866000	do you think we'll see any other like
9866000	9868000	commercial product video games
9868000	9870000	again because we used to get these all the time
9870000	9872000	back in the day like there was the mick kids game
9872000	9874000	the california raisins game
9874000	9876000	where the hell is my damn
9876000	9878000	burger king connect games were the most
9878000	9880000	recent ones they're supposed to have the burger king connect
9880000	9882000	game and they never fucking put it out
9882000	9884000	I don't know so we'll see
9884000	9886000	and now
9886000	9888000	burger king's all over transformers but no games
9888000	9890000	about chiggers
9890000	9892000	transformers all hasbro
9892000	9894000	the end no I'm kidding how about
9894000	9896000	another email yes another email
9896000	9898000	yes okay
9898000	9900000	I'm a few shows behind in my listening but
9900000	9902000	I just want to respond to Rob with his
9902000	9904000	opinion that college is a waste of money and you
9904000	9906000	learn better by doing I 100%
9906000	9908000	agree I spent 5 years in
9908000	9910000	college earned 2 bachelors degree television
9910000	9912000	production and asian studies graduated
9912000	9914000	summa cum laude in the top 10%
9914000	9916000	of my class I can be quoted
9916000	9918000	as saying frequently that the only good thing that
9918000	9920000	I got back from college was a husband
9920000	9922000	aside from being an abstract requirement
9922000	9924000	BK have
9924000	9926000	a BA when we don't care which one
9926000	9928000	nobody cares about all the painstaking
9928000	9930000	work I did in college I haven't touched editing software
9930000	9932000	since I left I haven't spoken Japanese Chinese
9932000	9934000	or Spanish since I left
9934000	9936000	all of the hard earned knowledge has faded away
9936000	9938000	and the reality is set in unless you're going to be
9938000	9940000	a doctor lawyer or something that requires daily
9940000	9942000	use of the knowledge you got in college it's
9942000	9944000	ultimately a costly waste of time
9944000	9946000	the job I have now has
9946000	9948000	diddly to do with my fancy degrees and I'm still
9948000	9950000	paying on the $2,000 I have
9950000	9952000	left in college bills when I have kids
9952000	9954000	they're going to trade school and learn to be plumbers
9954000	9956000	or HVAC technicians or car mechanics
9956000	9958000	and at
9958000	9960000	least then I will be secure in the knowledge that
9960000	9962000	what they've learned is useful and the
9962000	9964000	very least will save them money because they can fix
9964000	9966000	their own stuff Holly V
9966000	9968000	now I do have to say though
9968000	9970000	in the design field like
9970000	9972000	what I'm in college
9972000	9974000	college ends up being useful
9974000	9976000	because the classes that I take have
9976000	9978000	practical application for what
9978000	9980000	I'm doing I've built my
9980000	9982000	portfolio I've marketed myself
9982000	9984000	I'm already getting work and I
9984000	9986000	haven't finished college so I'm just
9986000	9988000	saying well and I want to be careful too I don't want to become
9988000	9990000	like this anti-college spokesperson because I wasn't
9990000	9992000	quite the point of my rant but I think what
9992000	9994000	I was meaning to get at is that it's not for everyone
9994000	9996000	and I think some people kind of
9996000	9998000	feel like there's this necessity like
9998000	10000000	I have to go I have to go and you
10000000	10002000	maybe you don't you know that's all
10002000	10004000	I'm kind of saying and you know will I ever go
10004000	10006000	back someday and finish maybe
10006000	10008000	but right now for the career that I'm doing
10008000	10010000	I would be better off spending my time getting
10010000	10012000	certifications and licenses and
10012000	10014000	things from organizations that support
10014000	10016000	my industry and not really a state school
10016000	10018000	I hate to say it but that's
10018000	10020000	where my
10020000	10022000	enrichment is going to come from now let me put it this way
10022000	10024000	college isn't for everyone but it might be for
10024000	10026000	you and your field and whatever you're doing
10026000	10028000	and here's my honest advice if you are going to go to
10028000	10030000	college here's the mistake not to make
10030000	10032000	make sure you don't do
10032000	10034000	nothing but school
10034000	10036000	okay if you're going to go to college
10036000	10038000	make sure you do some extracurricular activities
10038000	10040000	make sure you do internships
10040000	10042000	oh my god take I mean
10042000	10044000	I know it might sound ludicrous like I gotta do something and don't
10044000	10046000	get paid but the networking and experience
10046000	10048000	you're going to get from that are going to mean so
10048000	10050000	much more than your
10050000	10052000	A's and B's I'm serious
10052000	10054000	also make friends with your teachers
10054000	10056000	who are working in the field
10056000	10058000	yeah you're not in high school anymore it's not
10058000	10060000	cool to hate your teachers well I mean
10060000	10062000	keep in mind now I'm in school to be
10062000	10064000	a graphic designer which was
10064000	10066000	funny because I learned a lot of the programs
10066000	10068000	and stuff on my own but
10068000	10070000	I have picked up so much
10070000	10072000	in design technique and in theory
10072000	10074000	and just in studying
10074000	10076000	you know I
10076000	10078000	the best classes I've taken are my two
10078000	10080000	art history classes and my typography
10080000	10082000	class those have been my favorite so far
10082000	10084000	that and my portfolio class
10084000	10086000	which you've seen my portfolio
10086000	10088000	it came out fully
10088000	10090000	interview ready
10090000	10092000	I've got my portfolio online if anyone wants to see my
10092000	10094000	stuff just let me know and I will show you
10094000	10096000	and then hire me please
10096000	10098000	I will say this too you might be surprised
10098000	10100000	to hear me say this but I actually think it also
10100000	10102000	would be a good use of your time if this is
10102000	10104000	a scene you are into and if this is something you are
10104000	10106000	into join a fraternity or a sorority
10106000	10108000	that definitely was not the
10108000	10110000	scene for me but you know what
10110000	10112000	for some people I know that have been in that scene it has
10112000	10114000	been an
10114000	10116000	immensely helpful networking tool
10116000	10118000	like immensely helpful
10118000	10120000	networking tool you would be like those are connections
10120000	10122000	you're going to have for life so it's
10122000	10124000	been very rewarding for some people I know so
10124000	10126000	you know but it's not
10126000	10128000	for everyone either and it's really
10128000	10130000	about finding the right one for
10130000	10132000	you is a huge challenge
10132000	10134000	well and also find
10134000	10136000	different clubs or online
10136000	10138000	groups that people
10138000	10140000	in your field are going to like
10140000	10142000	you know if you're in engineering look for stuff
10142000	10144000	through the department of engineers you know that type
10144000	10146000	of stuff and if you're going to go to college
10146000	10148000	just to drink do yourself and do
10148000	10150000	the college a favor and don't go to college
10150000	10152000	or at least get a liberal arts degree
10152000	10154000	no not even that I'm just going to say
10154000	10156000	do yourself a favor and don't go to college
10156000	10158000	like you will be wasting money
10158000	10160000	you'll be wasting time
10160000	10162000	one thing about college though that I will say
10162000	10164000	is that
10164000	10166000	it gives you a chance to experiment
10166000	10168000	with new ideas and
10168000	10170000	to pick
10170000	10172000	different things because I've changed my
10172000	10174000	major like nine times before I finally just
10174000	10176000	decided to go with what I loved anyway
10176000	10178000	because I started off
10178000	10180000	as a forensic geology major
10180000	10182000	did you know that? I studied
10182000	10184000	rocks for blood
10184000	10186000	it was boring
10186000	10188000	as fuck
10188000	10190000	and then I changed my major so many times
10190000	10192000	and finally decided to stick with
10192000	10194000	art with something in the art field
10194000	10196000	I hate doing illustration for other people
10196000	10198000	because it's not my drawings anymore
10198000	10200000	but I love doing design for other people
10200000	10202000	and I've developed a passion
10202000	10204000	for it but I wouldn't have known that
10204000	10206000	design was where my heart was
10206000	10208000	until
10208000	10210000	I tried to do illustration and
10210000	10212000	I tried to do all this other stuff and eventually
10212000	10214000	I found the right path
10214000	10216000	by, and I even found out that
10216000	10218000	specifically print is my passion
10218000	10220000	and I would never have known that
10220000	10222000	if I had not taken typography
10222000	10224000	right then and there, if I had not taken the
10224000	10226000	InDesign class, so I'm just saying
10226000	10228000	as an example, school
10228000	10230000	is a good place to experiment
10230000	10232000	without
10232000	10234000	getting a job that you're going to hate
10234000	10236000	you know what I mean? So
10236000	10238000	I'm not going to continue my
10238000	10240000	rant, I said what I said a couple
10240000	10242000	shows ago and I stand by that
10242000	10244000	you know, but yeah
10244000	10246000	it's not for everyone, but it might be for you
10246000	10248000	and that's okay. It's your money
10248000	10250000	spend it how you want to spend it
10250000	10252000	Next email
10252000	10254000	Hi OLR crew, this is your
10254000	10256000	friendly neighborhood Mexican act Deft
10256000	10258000	I'm pretty sure you have already talked and discussed
10258000	10260000	about Capcom this week, but I want to vent a little
10260000	10262000	and share my two cents on their most recent happenings
10262000	10264000	Well needless to say, as many people
10264000	10266000	have probably said now, I
10266000	10268000	pretty much lost all faith in Capcom
10268000	10270000	Was it because of the release of
10270000	10272000	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3? No
10272000	10274000	I actually think, I actually
10274000	10276000	was pretty excited about
10276000	10278000	especially because of the addition of Phoenix Wright
10278000	10280000	Yeah granted, they're doing an update to a game not even
10280000	10282000	nine months after release of the first edition
10282000	10284000	Capcom has always done this kind of stuff
10284000	10286000	with all their fighting series and
10286000	10288000	I've learned to accept it. If you know Capcom
10288000	10290000	then you pretty much expect it to do so
10290000	10292000	which by the way, that actually did remind
10292000	10294000	me of something
10294000	10296000	when they did
10296000	10298000	all the different matching service
10298000	10300000	and different versions of Street Fighter 3 like
10300000	10302000	Second Strike and Third Impact
10302000	10304000	That's the same thing
10304000	10306000	Anyway, so why have I lost my confidence
10306000	10308000	in Capcom? It's because of all their
10308000	10310000	recent decisions as a company
10310000	10312000	and there's a lot of things that I can name
10312000	10314000	or list here. Unnecessary DRM
10314000	10316000	Mercenaries 3DS, Bionic Commando
10316000	10318000	Rearm 2, Super Street Fighter
10318000	10320000	4, Arcade Edition
10320000	10322000	The Cancellation of Games, Mega Man
10322000	10324000	Universe, Unnecessary Reboots, Devil May Cry
10324000	10326000	No localizations of games
10326000	10328000	people truly want, No Word on Monster Hunter
10328000	10330000	nor Ace Attorney Investigations 2 being localized
10330000	10332000	Little by little, Capcom has
10332000	10334000	done really bad decisions
10334000	10336000	that have really affected the fans
10336000	10338000	A company that was recently known
10338000	10340000	to cater to the fans and still even now
10340000	10342000	they kind of do it, is losing a lot of stuff
10342000	10344000	that have their fans
10344000	10346000	really angry, including me
10346000	10348000	and I think the straw that broke the camel was
10348000	10350000	the cancellation of Mega Man Legends 3
10350000	10352000	People have wanted that game for so long
10352000	10354000	and they just took it from them like
10354000	10356000	if nothing happened. And with this
10356000	10358000	also comes the slow killing
10358000	10360000	of Mega Man. Mega Man X was the most
10360000	10362000	wanted for MVC 3
10362000	10364000	and they didn't mention him being an ultimate
10364000	10366000	All of those things they've done
10366000	10368000	little by little have created a really
10368000	10370000	big ball of shit and they can't hide it now
10370000	10372000	and even if they do, the stink is so big
10372000	10374000	people will be reminded because of it
10374000	10376000	Capcom has created their own demise and unless
10376000	10378000	they do something to fix this problem, or at least
10378000	10380000	they admit they do have a problem
10380000	10382000	I won't be buying any game they release anytime
10382000	10384000	soon. And I mean it, not even
10384000	10386000	the Darkstalkers teaser they showed in their
10386000	10388000	Street Fighter X Tekken panel
10388000	10390000	Oh yeah, that hasn't even come up in the show yet
10390000	10392000	but yeah. A game I have wanted
10392000	10394000	to make, I've wanted them to make
10394000	10396000	for a long time
10396000	10398000	won't blind me of all they have done to lose
10398000	10400000	me as a fan. As Zekeman said in his
10400000	10402000	Tumblr and Twitter, Capcom, it's not me, it's you
10402000	10404000	Thanks for reading this
10404000	10406000	and for keep on giving gamers a voice
10406000	10408000	Act deft
10410000	10412000	Last email? I'm curious to see
10412000	10414000	how long that holds, and I'm not trying to be like
10414000	10416000	a jerk about it, but you know, usually this
10416000	10418000	internet rage, and then they'll announce something
10418000	10420000	you just have to have
10420000	10422000	But um, you know, obviously Capcom
10422000	10424000	surprisingly went from
10424000	10426000	all the fans love them and have very
10426000	10428000	loyal fans, to literally within the scope
10428000	10430000	of two weeks, have become
10430000	10432000	like, quote, the
10432000	10434000	Japanese Bobby Kotek, you know
10434000	10436000	what I mean? Like, it's just interesting
10436000	10438000	My How the Mighty Have Fallen
10438000	10440000	And uh, yeah, I
10440000	10442000	I just think the way Capcom cancelled it too
10442000	10444000	didn't help. And it's
10444000	10446000	it sucks that they said, hey, let's
10446000	10448000	involve this community, our hardcore fans
10448000	10450000	in a game, and then tell them the game isn't good enough
10450000	10452000	It's essentially what they did, that's
10452000	10454000	that's tough. That's a tough pill to swallow
10454000	10456000	Anyhow
10456000	10458000	Um, last email?
10458000	10460000	Yep. Hi, OLR
10460000	10462000	Just wanted to write in after the last few
10462000	10464000	weeks, comments from Capcom's David Reeves
10464000	10466000	I, I was more than
10466000	10468000	a little miffed at what he said
10468000	10470000	This coming from the same guy who used to
10470000	10472000	run Sony of Europe, and said that when
10472000	10474000	the PS3 was launching, that we have
10474000	10476000	built up a certain brand equity
10476000	10478000	over time, since the launch of
10478000	10480000	Playstation in 1995 and PS2 in 2000
10480000	10482000	The first five million are going to buy it
10482000	10484000	whatever it is, even if it doesn't
10484000	10486000	have games. And then he linked
10486000	10488000	to the full article, uh, interview
10488000	10490000	Anyway, I'm not going to rant, so I'll be off
10490000	10492000	Catastrophic Moggy
10492000	10494000	I don't like that, Catastrophic Moggy
10496000	10498000	Yeah
10498000	10500000	It's kind of dickly
10500000	10502000	Not, not muggy, but
10502000	10504000	all the stuff
10504000	10506000	Oh, that's not the interview
10506000	10508000	Sorry, I'm reading over your shoulder here
10508000	10510000	Yeah, this is the interview
10510000	10512000	It's a pretty long one, but
10512000	10514000	Like, one of the questions
10514000	10516000	Um, are you confident in your
10516000	10518000	approach and the inevitable buildup to
10518000	10520000	November's launch hype? And he says
10520000	10522000	without being too arrogant, I don't think we
10522000	10524000	worry too much about building up the hype in the
10524000	10526000	first six months, because when the rubber hits
10526000	10528000	the road is going to be when all those hardcore
10528000	10530000	gamers have bought PS3s
10530000	10532000	They have also bought Xbox 360s and they
10532000	10534000	probably bought Nintendo Wii as well
10534000	10536000	So basically, you know
10536000	10538000	There's a lot that haven't, though
10538000	10540000	There's a lot of people that only adopt one of
10540000	10542000	those systems, you know?
10542000	10544000	I don't know
10544000	10546000	That guy says a lot of very interesting things
10546000	10548000	Alright, that's going to do it for email tonight
10548000	10550000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
10550000	10552000	if you want to send us an email for a future week
10552000	10554000	In the meantime, I believe it's time
10554000	10556000	to get the ranting on
10556000	10558000	in a segment we call the FUs of the Week
10558000	10560000	Let's go to the FUs of the Week right now
10560000	10575000	Music
10575000	10578000	An FU to the bee sting I got on my neck
10578000	10582000	And the stinger didn't break the skin
10582000	10584000	Well, it broke the skin, but not like
10584000	10586000	it didn't get stuck in there
10586000	10588000	But it is enough
10588000	10590000	I'm allergic to bees
10590000	10592000	So it's enough that it's
10592000	10594000	pretty bad
10594000	10596000	I also got another, I got a scrape from the stinger
10596000	10598000	on my leg from a dead bee in the pool
10598000	10600000	And that thankfully didn't swell up
10600000	10602000	But I got another one and I have no idea when I got it
10602000	10604000	It was just
10604000	10606000	I felt it, and that was it
10606000	10608000	Uh, go ahead Logie
10608000	10612000	Um, FU to uh
10612000	10616000	I guess I'm not agreeing so far away
10616000	10618000	Alright
10618000	10620000	And my FU goes to um
10620000	10622000	a couple things tonight, FU to Johnny Rockets
10622000	10624000	because I went there to eat the other day and it took like
10624000	10626000	25 minutes to get our food
10626000	10628000	Uh, and it wasn't even busy
10628000	10630000	But, and also FU to them because once the food finally
10630000	10632000	did fucking come, the burgers I had were fucking delicious
10632000	10634000	There were sliders, that's why I said burgers
10634000	10636000	I'm not that fat
10636000	10638000	Those sliders are fucking good
10638000	10640000	Have you had the orange
10640000	10642000	was it the orange dreamsicle shake
10642000	10644000	No, no
10644000	10646000	Like I'm actually trying to lose weight
10646000	10648000	right now, so Johnny
10648000	10650000	I had to cut back on something
10650000	10652000	No, no, you should not cut back on the orange dreamsicle shake
10652000	10654000	That is delicious
10654000	10656000	Oh, I, uh, yeah, so FU
10656000	10658000	Yeah, and FU to the fact that they derailed my diet
10658000	10660000	because that food is so delicious
10660000	10662000	Well, I don't know which Johnny Rockets you went to, but they have one
10662000	10664000	I'll say Arden Fairmaul
10664000	10666000	Well, they have a new one now that's across from the new
10666000	10668000	Palladio theaters
10668000	10670000	Oh, okay
10670000	10672000	Uh, yeah, I bet they didn't take
10672000	10674000	Well, see, if it took, like, if the place
10674000	10676000	was packed and busy, then I would understand why it would take so long
10676000	10678000	It was, like, empty, it was weird
10678000	10680000	So, anyway, FU did that
10680000	10682000	And FU did those burgers being delicious and making me want to go through that torture
10682000	10684000	again just to have them and screw up my diet
10684000	10686000	I've lost ten pounds in three months, almost
10686000	10688000	Nine pounds in three months
10688000	10690000	Get a bicycle and go riding with me
10690000	10692000	We live too far apart
10692000	10694000	to do that every day, especially this time of year
10694000	10696000	Alright, uh, and then
10696000	10698000	Oh, the other FU, I have one more FU
10698000	10700000	And then FU goes to, um, Salacious Pop
10700000	10702000	Not only for eliminating Pennywise from the list
10702000	10704000	But we went to the casino last night
10704000	10706000	I lost $20
10706000	10708000	This bitch puts, like, $5
10708000	10710000	in the slot machine and on his second pull
10710000	10712000	wins $70
10712000	10714000	Did he buy you dinner?
10714000	10716000	No!
10716000	10718000	But he did buy all the stuff at Target earlier that day
10718000	10720000	so I can't complain, I can't complain
10720000	10722000	He bought me a Hummingbird feeder because I wanted one
10722000	10724000	That's awesome
10724000	10726000	I know, I know
10726000	10728000	I know, at the end of the day
10728000	10730000	But I was really mad at the moment
10730000	10732000	Not really, though
10732000	10734000	Did you stomp your little foot?
10734000	10736000	I wasn't mad that he won, I was mad that I lost
10736000	10738000	and he won on his second pull
10738000	10740000	You should see how fast I went through $20
10740000	10742000	He was just gone in a snap, and then he's like
10742000	10744000	Oh, I think I'm winning, like, all this money
10744000	10746000	The coin thing keeps going
10746000	10748000	Do I get to keep all this?
10748000	10752000	Now you see why I don't like to gamble
10752000	10754000	Oh, I still love to gamble
10754000	10756000	I don't even play the lottery
10756000	10758000	I love gambling
10758000	10760000	It's a bad problem I have
10760000	10762000	Anyhow, let's move on to
10762000	10764000	a couple more news stories for you guys
10764000	10766000	and then the Skype line
10766000	10768000	as well as the results of tonight's list list
10768000	10770000	So let's do a couple more stories for you guys
10770000	10772000	Loki
10772000	10774000	You may remember a couple weeks back
10774000	10776000	we talked a little bit about people
10776000	10778000	that had games on
10778000	10780000	the Indie Games Store
10780000	10782000	on the Xbox Marketplace
10782000	10786000	were complaining that they just weren't getting enough exposure
10786000	10790000	and that the sales weren't very well
10790000	10792000	even for some of the top games on that service
10792000	10794000	Well, one of those companies
10794000	10796000	Z-Boy Games
10796000	10798000	they, of course, released
10798000	10800000	Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death 7
10800000	10804000	They now have put their games on Steam
10804000	10808000	and they're very pleased on how things are going
10808000	10810000	In fact, they're saying that
10810000	10812000	Z-Boy Games
10812000	10814000	has already made more revenue
10814000	10816000	in less than a week on Steam
10816000	10818000	than we have in over a year and a half
10818000	10820000	on Xbox Indie Games
10820000	10822000	That sucks
10822000	10824000	Well, it sucks for the Indie Games
10824000	10826000	but good for them that they're making money
10826000	10830000	Basically saying that they
10830000	10832000	decided, you know
10832000	10834000	because of this
10834000	10836000	that they're definitely looking at
10836000	10838000	launching more games on to Steam
10838000	10842000	versus, you know, the Xbox Indie Games service
10846000	10848000	And of course, you may remember
10848000	10850000	they also took donation support
10850000	10852000	That's a pretty big slap in the face
10852000	10854000	to Xbox Live Indie Games
10854000	10856000	and I think a pretty obvious showing
10856000	10858000	of how Steam's doing it right and Xbox
10858000	10860000	isn't doing it right when it comes to the Indie Games
10860000	10862000	but to be fair, there is a little bit of apples and oranges
10862000	10864000	going on here because
10864000	10866000	Steam, that really was
10866000	10868000	their only new release that week
10868000	10870000	whereas with Xbox Live, you still have all the
10870000	10872000	arcade games and all that stuff that they do have to promote
10872000	10874000	But, I'm not going to say I totally disagree
10874000	10876000	I think they should start featuring
10876000	10878000	some Indie Games in the main banner
10878000	10880000	once in a great while, especially these big ones
10880000	10882000	that do very well
10882000	10884000	If they would take the Indie Games
10884000	10886000	and say, have a certain release day
10886000	10888000	for those, and maybe
10888000	10890000	a little bit more quality control with the stuff that's released
10890000	10892000	You know, because I know with
10892000	10894000	WiiWare and stuff, you have blog sites
10894000	10896000	and everything that lists
10896000	10898000	And actually Kotaku's been pretty good about
10898000	10900000	they don't know
10900000	10902000	I don't know if they do all the Indie Games
10902000	10904000	that are released that week
10904000	10906000	or if it's just the ones that
10906000	10908000	they're playing or the ones
10908000	10910000	that they think are kind of cool
10910000	10912000	They'll do a thread every
10912000	10914000	week or so, pointing those out
10914000	10916000	and how much you can get them for
10916000	10918000	and the links to download them and that kind of stuff
10918000	10920000	I think that they should have something like that
10920000	10922000	where the Playstation Network comes out and says
10922000	10924000	Hey, here's what's releasing on our service
10924000	10926000	and not necessarily promoting them
10926000	10928000	but it's at least mentioning them
10928000	10930000	so people are aware of them
10930000	10932000	and granted, there's a lot of crap on there too
10932000	10934000	but
10934000	10936000	it's just, you know, there's something wrong
10936000	10938000	obviously, if they're making
10938000	10940000	more money on Steam
10940000	10942000	than they are in the Indie Games service
10942000	10944000	in less than a week
10944000	10948000	I mean, why would you waste your time on Indie Games
10948000	10950000	if you can just
10950000	10952000	put your game on Steam
10952000	10954000	and make that money in a week?
10954000	10956000	Yeah, that's kind of scary
10956000	10958000	but then again, if all
10958000	10960000	I mean, Xbox Live gets a lot
10960000	10962000	of Indie Games and these were obviously
10962000	10964000	two of the quality ones
10964000	10966000	If everything that went out on Xbox Live
10966000	10968000	went up on Steam, they wouldn't all sell as well
10968000	10970000	That's the difference
10970000	10972000	Well, yes, they wouldn't all sell as well
10972000	10974000	but the ones that people are actually putting effort into
10974000	10976000	and are considered hits on
10976000	10978000	the Indie Games service
10978000	10980000	aren't making that much money anyways
10980000	10982000	I guess that's true enough
10982000	10984000	Alright, let's go to
10984000	10986000	a story here about Akira Yamaoka
10986000	10988000	working with Suda51
10988000	10990000	He's, what they say, tag teaming
10990000	10992000	with Suda51 on the game development
10992000	10994000	This is during an interview on the
10994000	10996000	8-4 play podcast
10996000	10998000	Yamaoka talked a little more about what his
10998000	11000000	role is, besides just the chief
11000000	11002000	sound officer
11002000	11004000	Quote, at Grasshopper I'm creating sound
11004000	11006000	but not only sound, I'm the leader of the
11006000	11008000	development team, so I'm tag teaming with
11008000	11010000	Suda51, and I'm actually involved
11010000	11012000	with game creation as well as sound
11012000	11014000	He said that there are a few titles they're going
11014000	11016000	to announce soon, so stay tuned
11016000	11018000	There you go
11018000	11020000	By the way, I guess in this podcast
11020000	11022000	he also talked about how he almost quit
11022000	11024000	Konami after his first week
11024000	11026000	Be interesting to see
11026000	11028000	Alright
11028000	11030000	I'm all for more Akira Yamaoka
11030000	11032000	games
11032000	11034000	I'm glad he didn't leave the industry altogether
11034000	11036000	that he's still making games
11036000	11038000	Silent Hill just isn't the same without him
11038000	11040000	Uh, yeah
11040000	11042000	Yeah
11042000	11044000	Yeah
11044000	11046000	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangetownstory.com
11046000	11048000	There is a little bit of a buffer, so they're still on the last story
11048000	11050000	So let's just pop says, Steam Valve would probably
11050000	11052000	say no to 90% of the shit that
11052000	11054000	Xbox Live Indie games have in their store
11054000	11056000	Good, I think that they should
11056000	11058000	But who, see, who is it to determine quality?
11058000	11060000	Because I would say there's some shit
11060000	11062000	on Steam too
11062000	11064000	But one thing I do like about Steam
11064000	11066000	is that they provide quick links
11066000	11068000	to find reviews and so forth
11068000	11070000	And Metacritic, love it or hate it, their score
11070000	11072000	is right there
11072000	11074000	I think they only show it if it's above a certain score
11074000	11076000	though, because it's not there for every game
11076000	11078000	But kind of interesting nonetheless
11078000	11080000	Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line
11080000	11082000	at 1877 Game OLR
11082000	11084000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
11084000	11086000	The Skype line is open now for your calls
11086000	11088000	If you want to give us a call
11088000	11090000	We're going to try to keep the calls probably a little brief tonight
11090000	11092000	It's extraordinarily long tonight
11092000	11094000	We're already at a three hour show
11094000	11096000	and we haven't even gotten into calls yet
11096000	11098000	So we're going to take those calls
11098000	11100000	Again, that's 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype
11100000	11102000	is OrangeLoungeRadio
11102000	11104000	Let's see if Loki has any last minute stories
11104000	11106000	Not much
11106000	11108000	They had a
11108000	11110000	Tekken Bowl, I guess, was released this week
11110000	11112000	for free on iOS
11112000	11114000	Which is kind of lame
11114000	11116000	Is that like bowling with Tekken characters?
11116000	11118000	Yes it is!
11118000	11120000	Oh, right, right, right
11120000	11122000	And actually, you're right, because they're going to be
11122000	11124000	featuring that as well in the
11124000	11126000	I guess, Tekken Tag HD
11126000	11128000	or whatever that they're doing
11128000	11130000	But yeah, you can download it for free
11130000	11132000	Getting it
11132000	11134000	Alright, our phone's ringing
11134000	11136000	so let's go to it
11136000	11138000	Hi, you're on the phone, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
11138000	11140000	Hey, it's the one and only Rama
11140000	11142000	Of course, what's up Rama?
11142000	11144000	A whole lot of stuff
11144000	11146000	Just stuff
11146000	11148000	What kind of stuff?
11148000	11150000	Love you too, Rob
11150000	11152000	Love you too
11152000	11154000	Well, what's up?
11154000	11156000	Well, first off
11156000	11158000	I was stoned off
11158000	11160000	off my tuchus last week
11160000	11162000	That's why I ended up with a Playstation 3
11162000	11164000	That's the first thing
11164000	11168000	You were stoned and you bought a Playstation 3?
11168000	11170000	I was so stoned off
11170000	11172000	my tuchus that the decision to buy one
11172000	11174000	was a good idea
11174000	11176000	Okay, so you bought a PS3
11176000	11178000	when you were high and you regret it now?
11178000	11180000	Actually, no
11180000	11182000	It's just an expressive blu-ray player like everybody else
11182000	11184000	says, but you know
11184000	11186000	It has a few good games on it
11186000	11188000	I know
11188000	11190000	LittleBigPlanet, I'm telling you
11190000	11192000	It's probably one of the greatest games of this generation
11192000	11194000	period on either console
11194000	11196000	It's in the queue
11196000	11198000	Alright, fair enough
11198000	11200000	Thank you
11200000	11202000	Now, about this whole
11202000	11204000	Capcom debacle
11204000	11206000	I'm probably the only
11206000	11208000	person that actually
11208000	11210000	feels that Capcom was in the right
11210000	11212000	to cancel the game
11212000	11214000	The only fuck-up was how they handled the whole
11214000	11216000	PR spin on the whole thing
11216000	11218000	I don't necessarily agree
11218000	11220000	that it was right, because I personally
11220000	11222000	am a fan of Mega Man Legends
11222000	11224000	but I am kind of trying to see it from their point of view
11224000	11226000	and I do understand the business perspective
11226000	11228000	If they don't make money, then it's not worth our time
11228000	11230000	But I do agree
11230000	11232000	that their biggest faux pas was how they handled it
11232000	11234000	Yeah
11234000	11236000	But defend yourself
11236000	11238000	a little bit to the fanboys
11238000	11240000	You're not even saying
11240000	11242000	like, you're just flattered saying
11242000	11244000	I agree with Capcom, they should just cancel it
11244000	11246000	Why?
11246000	11248000	In this age of money's getting kind of tight
11248000	11250000	a lot of these companies, as much money as they're making
11250000	11252000	we don't know how much of that is
11252000	11254000	revenue, profit, this or that
11254000	11256000	Who knows? If they invest a lot of money
11256000	11258000	in making this game
11258000	11260000	doesn't fit the bill
11260000	11262000	then they're out a lot of money
11262000	11264000	These companies really can't afford to do that
11264000	11266000	And what I find interesting is that
11266000	11270000	there's not that many Mega Man Legends fans out there
11270000	11272000	Granted, if you look at the online petition
11272000	11274000	there's so many fans
11274000	11276000	but most of them are just jumping on the bandwagon
11276000	11280000	just because they need a common cause to fight over
11280000	11282000	I will admit, I wonder how many of those people would actually
11282000	11284000	buy the game and how many are just wanting to pirate it
11284000	11287000	Because I had the first Mega Man Legends game
11287000	11289000	I'm not going to say it's crap
11289000	11291000	I thought it was a pretty good game
11291000	11293000	I didn't get the second one
11293000	11295000	because it wasn't
11295000	11297000	it was a good concept
11297000	11300000	but it just wasn't my cup of tea
11300000	11302000	Right
11302000	11304000	I kind of wish I could find the game again
11304000	11306000	I kind of want to play it
11306000	11308000	Is it on Playstation 3 download stuff?
11308000	11310000	I don't think it is
11310000	11312000	Anyway
11312000	11314000	I'm kind of surprised it wasn't
11314000	11316000	It might have drummed up more interest for a third one
11316000	11318000	Yeah, but
11318000	11320000	that's how it goes
11320000	11322000	Yep
11322000	11325000	So what about other stuff going on in Capcom's world
11325000	11327000	like the Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 news
11327000	11329000	How do you feel about that?
11329000	11331000	I'm amused that Phoenix Wright is in the game
11331000	11333000	That is kind of awesome
11333000	11335000	But is it $40 awesome?
11335000	11337000	I tend to think so
11337000	11339000	because I have to agree with what Rob D. said
11339000	11341000	They're rebalancing the characters
11341000	11343000	They're adding new stages
11343000	11345000	and adding more features and functionality to make it worth the $40
11345000	11347000	I mean, they kind of did the same thing
11347000	11349000	when they re-released Super Street Fighter 4
11349000	11352000	I mean, if they did the whole $59.99 price tag
11352000	11355000	I sure as hell would wait until it drops to $39
11355000	11357000	That's just me
11357000	11359000	Which is, I think, the price point they're going to try and put it out at
11359000	11361000	Mmhmm
11363000	11365000	Woah
11365000	11367000	Sorry, I dropped my phone
11367000	11369000	That wasn't good
11369000	11371000	I hope you have AppleCare on it
11371000	11373000	No, it's fine. No, and I don't have AppleCare either
11373000	11375000	It's just outside a year or two
11375000	11377000	So, no, it's fine. I'm good, we're good
11377000	11379000	Alright, anyhow
11379000	11381000	Well, on that note, anything else on your mind tonight?
11381000	11383000	Last thing, I don't know if you heard
11383000	11385000	but Sears has this massive video game clearance sale
11385000	11387000	at all of their stores
11387000	11389000	Oh, are they just unloading all of the video games altogether?
11389000	11391000	Yeah, but the thing is
11391000	11393000	your mileage may vary
11393000	11395000	because I've been hitting various stores
11395000	11397000	Like, I do know right now
11397000	11399000	most of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band bundles
11399000	11401000	are $20
11401000	11403000	Nice, Toys R Us did something like that
11403000	11405000	a couple weeks ago, and I do kind of want a new Guitar Hero bundle
11405000	11409000	Yeah, including the big Super bundles
11409000	11411000	I went to one Sears
11411000	11413000	I picked up Guitar Hero Metallica
11413000	11415000	for 96 cents, so I bought the last three
11415000	11417000	Holy shit
11417000	11419000	For the record, by the way
11419000	11421000	I don't know if you've got Big Lots
11421000	11423000	I think they opened one up
11423000	11425000	by me somewhere
11425000	11427000	We mostly have amazing savings
11427000	11429000	Dan picked up DJ Hero for me the bundle for $20
11429000	11431000	It was a couple months ago
11431000	11433000	but they get them in
11433000	11435000	and we found like a DDR there
11435000	11437000	for $20 with the pad and everything
11437000	11439000	Nice
11439000	11441000	I was thinking about picking up the DJ Hero 2 bundle
11441000	11443000	and sell the turntable
11443000	11445000	and find somebody that wanted a turntable
11445000	11447000	because I already have two
11447000	11449000	but nobody I know wants it
11449000	11451000	so I was like, there's no point in me buying it
11451000	11453000	because I refuse to sell to
11453000	11455000	the evil people, you know?
11455000	11457000	Right, right
11457000	11459000	I used to put it on Craigslist
11459000	11461000	It would be kinda hard too if you don't have the game, you know what I mean?
11461000	11463000	But you know how that rolls
11463000	11465000	Alright, well we're gonna let you go
11465000	11467000	so we can get some more calls
11467000	11469000	but thanks for calling, have a good one
11469000	11471000	Alright, bye-bye
11471000	11473000	Let's go to the phones
11473000	11475000	We got other calls coming in
11475000	11477000	Pick up the phone again
11477000	11479000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
11479000	11481000	Hey, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto
11481000	11483000	Hey Kaijuto, what's on your mind, buddy?
11483000	11485000	Not much, I'm gonna make it quick
11485000	11487000	So, what is it, Marvel 3 now?
11487000	11489000	Marvel vs Capcom 3 Ultimate, yes
11489000	11491000	Yeah, my thing is
11491000	11493000	Okay, so this new game
11493000	11495000	is supposed to have more content
11495000	11497000	than the original, right?
11497000	11499000	And the original is $60, right?
11499000	11501000	Right
11501000	11503000	And this new version is gonna be $40, right?
11503000	11505000	Yes
11505000	11507000	Why not make all of those fucking fighting games $40?
11507000	11509000	That's a great question
11509000	11511000	Why not make all the fucking fighting games $40?
11511000	11513000	I will say this though, when I was at the
11513000	11515000	place that I will not talk about anymore
11515000	11517000	I did see that they had dropped
11517000	11519000	the price of Marvel vs Capcom 3 to $40
11519000	11521000	But that certainly wasn't
11521000	11523000	its price new, originally
11523000	11525000	Yeah, I think
11525000	11527000	To me, when I think fighting game
11527000	11529000	I always think retro
11529000	11531000	So I always think that those games should be
11531000	11533000	low price, I never understood
11533000	11535000	the $60 for Street Fighter
11535000	11537000	I waited for
11537000	11539000	the second version of Street Fighter
11539000	11541000	It's dropped down to $30
11541000	11543000	Oh, then the place that shouldn't be named
11543000	11545000	is just overcharging now, what a surprise
11545000	11547000	I was recent, it was
11547000	11549000	Thursday, Friday
11549000	11551000	Okay, well I was there Saturday and they suck
11551000	11553000	But I want to say
11553000	11555000	this quickly though, since you brought up retro
11555000	11557000	I will bring up this
11557000	11559000	In 95, I think it was
11559000	11561000	when Street Fighter 2 came out for the
11561000	11563000	Super Nintendo, I remember dropping $70
11563000	11565000	on that game
11565000	11567000	I spent $65 on Killer Instinct
11567000	11569000	I mean, Super Nintendo games were expensive
11569000	11571000	a few years ago, which
11571000	11573000	inflation and all that means
11573000	11575000	it was probably more like $100 paid for that game
11575000	11577000	So, you can't
11577000	11579000	always say that fighting games have always been cheap
11579000	11581000	Yeah, that's for sure
11581000	11583000	But I mean, now I think they're kinda
11583000	11585000	You know, like I said
11585000	11587000	Whenever I think Street Fighter
11587000	11589000	or any of the other games, I'm always thinking
11589000	11591000	early 90s, I never think
11591000	11593000	oh, this is a new game, I always feel like it's a
11593000	11595000	rehash of something that I played
11595000	11597000	long ago, you know? I have no problem
11597000	11599000	with them, but I just think they were
11599000	11601000	But seriously, when Street Fighter 2 came out
11601000	11603000	it was the goddamn arcade
11603000	11605000	at home. I mean, that translation was
11605000	11607000	so fucking good of Street Fighter 2
11607000	11609000	Like, it was just, oh my god
11609000	11611000	It just blew our minds
11611000	11613000	Oh, yeah, I remember that
11613000	11615000	I remember the first time I ever played it on the Super Nintendo
11615000	11617000	I was like, oh shit, I got the
11617000	11619000	arcade machine in my house
11619000	11621000	I was like, freaking out
11621000	11623000	Anyhow, sorry
11623000	11625000	No problem
11625000	11627000	Yeah, you guys need to get on Minecraft
11627000	11629000	The pay version, try it
11629000	11631000	I really do not like Minecraft
11631000	11633000	I know, I tried, I tried
11633000	11635000	Well, at least it was the free version
11635000	11637000	But even Terraria
11637000	11639000	I didn't mean to cut you off, but the free version
11639000	11641000	is totally different from the pay version
11641000	11643000	Trust me, the pay version
11643000	11645000	We'll see, if I run out of the other games
11645000	11647000	that I have, maybe I'll check it out
11647000	11649000	But I tried playing Terraria
11649000	11651000	this week, it was okay
11651000	11653000	But I was like, oh wow, this really is
11653000	11655000	just Minecraft
11655000	11657000	Yeah, I kind of hit that too
11657000	11659000	I did play some in Minecraft
11659000	11661000	Oh well
11661000	11663000	Although Dan just showed me something interesting today
11663000	11665000	Someone created the whole middle earth
11665000	11667000	pretty much, in Minecraft
11667000	11669000	Including underground places
11669000	11671000	and the whole dwarven areas and whatnot
11671000	11673000	Yeah, when people take the time to do
11673000	11675000	that stuff, it actually comes out really interesting
11675000	11677000	So, that's pretty cool
11677000	11679000	Anyway, we lost Kaijuto
11679000	11681000	We did not hang up on him
11681000	11683000	The Skype connection crapped out
11683000	11685000	Does that mean, let me just check on the status
11685000	11687000	of the show, no, we're still streaming, so we're still up and running
11687000	11689000	So unfortunately, the Kaijuto
11689000	11691000	thing cut out, but
11691000	11693000	I hope you had a good night, and so on
11695000	11697000	I'm gonna go ahead and close up Skype, I think, tonight
11697000	11699000	So sorry to those of you that didn't get through, sorry it was a shorter
11699000	11701000	segment than usual, but we're running really long tonight
11701000	11703000	So, sorry about that
11703000	11705000	So we're gonna go ahead and wrap up the last minute story
11705000	11707000	so we can wrap up the show, so, Loki?
11707000	11709000	I got nothing
11709000	11711000	Well, alright then, Dark Soccer, anything?
11711000	11713000	Well, Salacious Pop brought up
11713000	11715000	that Capcom published Street Fighter Alpha 2
11715000	11717000	for the SNES
11717000	11719000	It was really sucky, and it had loading time
11719000	11721000	Oh yeah, it was like a Super Nintendo cartridge
11721000	11723000	with loading time I own it
11723000	11725000	I own it Yeah? Yeah
11725000	11727000	And no, I'm not gonna pay for Minecraft
11729000	11731000	I don't know, I might, when I run out of
11731000	11733000	other games to play, I'll kinda get to that
11733000	11735000	but, I still have so many games
11735000	11737000	I gotta beat, and then Minecraft seems like one of those
11737000	11739000	time sinks, you spend a lot of time, but I gotta admit
11739000	11741000	I would like to explore
11741000	11743000	I like exploring worlds, especially
11743000	11745000	recreations of stuff, so
11745000	11747000	like, if there's ways to go in
11747000	11749000	and explore that middle-earth stuff, that might be kinda fun
11749000	11751000	actually, that'd be kinda cool
11751000	11753000	Alright, well let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts
11753000	11755000	so we can close up shop for tonight, so
11755000	11757000	Loki, what's your
11757000	11759000	final thought tonight?
11759000	11761000	My final thought is
11761000	11763000	I can't wait till
11763000	11765000	Tuesday
11765000	11767000	I'm gonna go be brought
11767000	11769000	I better fucking bring Saints for the third
11769000	11771000	I'm gonna be very disappointed otherwise
11771000	11773000	cause we got like a bunch of people coming in
11773000	11775000	I know that we're, Ubisoft will probably
11775000	11777000	bring Just Dance 3 cause they brought
11777000	11779000	Just Dance 2 last year
11779000	11781000	THQ last year brought Smackdown vs.
11781000	11783000	Raw 11
11783000	11785000	but I think
11785000	11787000	you know, if they're bringing the biggest game
11787000	11789000	it's gonna be Saints for the third
11789000	11791000	and then of course, Microsoft will be there this year
11791000	11793000	which is kinda cool, and I know LucasArts
11793000	11795000	and the
11795000	11797000	Star Wars Connect game
11797000	11799000	so, lots of stuff to play
11799000	11801000	Well then good, I wanna hear your rundowns on it next week
11801000	11803000	so, my final thought is
11803000	11805000	this show ran long
11805000	11807000	and it's getting late
11807000	11809000	I'm getting hungry, so, it's time to go
11809000	11811000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
11811000	11813000	I just texted Dan that I have hungers
11813000	11815000	and he needs to bring me my burger
11815000	11817000	You want a taco? Oh no, you want a burger
11817000	11819000	Well, Dan's bringing me a burger
11819000	11821000	I don't have to pay for a burger
11821000	11823000	I want a taco
11823000	11825000	Actually, I want a fish taco
11825000	11827000	Maybe tomorrow
