Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's the host?

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, July 10th, 2011

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Is the Playstation 4 release set to start production soon?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
The PSP says goodbye to comics

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
and Nintendo faces a lawsuit over the 3DS

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
and welcome back to the show where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
We are live on this July 10th, 2011

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
for the 419th episode of our show

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I want cake

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Get in line

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
I had ice cream cake yesterday, it was delish

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
So did I

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I know

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
And it had princesses on it

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Yes, Salacious Pop had a birthday yesterday

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
and mine was a couple of weeks ago as you might recall

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
but we did like a joint birthday thing

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
more closer to his birthday, I'm sorry

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
His birthday was two days ago but the party was yesterday

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
and so we had a joint cake

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
It's one of our friends' bot and it's one of those snarky friends

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
that's, you know, funny, bitchy funny

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
and got a cake that said Happy Birthday Princesses with the two Mickey and Minnie Mouse on it

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
But it was cute and I ate some of the sand part

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
And I was just very happy because we just didn't want chocolate

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
because you might remember on OLR a few weeks ago

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I got a chocolate cake, which was great, I loved it, don't get me wrong

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Then I went to work, and I had a chocolate cake at work from co-workers

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
and I'm like, oh yay, more chocolate

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
But I bet Becky's cake was better

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Becky's cake was better because hers

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
you could tell the difference between homemade and store-bought

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
So I mean, I appreciated the cake at work, don't get me wrong

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
But, you know, I think the Becky cake was a little more from the heart

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
if you will, rather than from the grocery store

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Anyhow, let's go over to the third co-host on our show

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
here with us as he's been every single week since episode one

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
with few minor exceptions like when kids are born

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Loki!

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Hi

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Hi, how are you tonight, Loki?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm a little sick, but I'm alright

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
You're sick? You better not get me sick, I'm gonna kick your butt

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Hey, I've been doing everything possible not to get anybody else sick

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm gonna wash my hands like crazy, and that's pretty much it

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
That's okay, I've got a bucket of Lysol I could dump on him

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
You might need to do that, because I really can't get sick

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Speaking of work, I have a lot going on at work, I cannot get sick

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
It's not bad, it's just congestion, that's it

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
It's not like I'm throwing up or something

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
It's just like, it could very well be allergies, but it's not

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
And it all started with one damn sneeze

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
I sneezed, and then all of a sudden I'm like, ugh, and I'm sick

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
It's like an avalanche

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
It's like sneeze plague

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
It's like when my nose started feeling like burning after that

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm like, ugh, I hate you

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah, I had this weird thing going on where the top of my throat was getting all scratchy

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
a couple weeks ago, or no, not a couple weeks ago, it was more like last week

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
and I was like, oh crap, this is me starting to get sick

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
I started taking the emergency and the other vitamins, like loading my body with sea and zinc

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
just to try and fend it off, and I guess it worked

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Shooting up with steroids

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
I didn't go that far, come on, I'm not Arnold Schwarzenegger

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
Anyhow, let's talk about video games as we get into another week here at OLR

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
where we talk about the gaming news, invite you guys to call us

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
and of course join us in chat at chat.orangelandrader.com

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Speaking of the chat

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
What's that?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I asked Azure Edge, who said, I love bronies

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Is that like brownies for bros?

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Is that the My Little Brony thing that we were talking about a couple weeks ago?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Maybe

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I think there's a phantom W in that

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Unless bronies are actually like

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
That would be brow-nies

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
Brownies with bacon inside of them, you know, brownies with bacon, those would be bronies

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
A couple of my friends, they're actually sisters, they make bacon brownies

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
We are very much considering a pork party for Josh's first birthday

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
I'm serious, it's looking like it's probably going to happen

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
Tarak Sakri, you could protest, you could stand outside with your PETA sign

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Fuck PETA

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Here's some other fun random things real quick

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
One of the other runner-up ideas for a party

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
and we're probably thinking about this for maybe second or third year

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
and you're going to laugh, pedo bear themed

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Why would you do that for your child?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Because it's funny, because our friends would know what it is, but our family doesn't know what pedo bear is

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
They think it's just a teddy bear, it would be hilarious

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Are you going to get a bounce house and everything?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Maybe

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
You should get the Pikachu bounce house where you climb into Pikachu's butt

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
I think Dark Sakura should dress up as pedo bear

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
I said internet meme themed party

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
because we were trying to think of something that's not been done before

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Pork party I think is pretty

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
You should do a troll party and make everyone wear troll masks

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
I was going to say, if you do an internet meme party, I will come as Nyan Cat

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
I will have little rainbow streamers behind me, I'll wear a pop tart

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
I think that would be funny, but maybe not this year

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
The only reason she was thinking of doing pork party

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
I guess some of her Facebook, like mommy friends or whatever

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
One of them makes cakes, and they said

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Oh I can make a pig cake with an apple in its mouth

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
And the apple would be its own personal little cake for Josh

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Little known fact about me, my uncle is actually a pig farmer

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
They have a ranch out in the not so city part of Sacramento

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Like out in the valley a little more

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
They actually have a little ranch out there where they raise pigs to be sold for food basically

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
For all those pickled pigs feet

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
And it's kind of sick because we used to go there for Easter and Christmas and all the holidays

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
And I was younger, and man we would just have a feast of bacon and all that stuff

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
And it didn't really hit me until much later in life

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Oh god, it was kind of

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Sad

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I'm gonna take some bacon outside for the pigs

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
We used to go out to the barn and look at the baby pigs

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
It was like, oh it's cute the baby pigs

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
And we'd come in and just feast on ham

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
And now I'm realizing like, god that was kind of messed up

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Ham, okay even when I did eat pork

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Ham has always been so disgusting to me

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
It just tastes like, not right

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Okay I promise we'll get into video games here in a minute

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
But I have to say about like ham

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I gotta say I am a ham person

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I like the honey baked hams, those are my favorite

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
But for Thanksgiving, I really don't like turkey

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I am not a turkey person

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I always get my own drumstick

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
My mother's very kind in that she always makes a ham

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Which is funny because I have two brothers

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
And we would always fight over them

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
So I'd just say fine, neither of you can have them

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
I'd wrap them up and put it in the fridge

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Alright, video games, quickly before we get into gaming weeks

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
I want to do a quick follow up to a story from last week

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
It's not on the show roll anywhere

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf who of course

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
As he has been for many many many many weeks

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Is on before us as we do tape live every Sunday night at allgames.com

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Right after Bobby's show

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
One of the things he was talking about on his 300th episode

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Grats on the ding by the way

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
He was talking about the whole update to the Nintendo games

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Supposedly, as we reported on last week or the week before

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Are not coming to the US

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Because Nintendo just has no interest in those games at that time

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
There's this whole Operation Rainfall

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
That's trying to get the games localized

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Well apparently there's some mole within Nintendo

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
That reported to Operation Rainfall that

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, these games are coming

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
It's just a very hush thing right now

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Which leads me to believe that

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
You hit the nail on the head last week, Loki

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
When Reggie's gonna come out

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
It may not be in XD3, it could be like the holiday

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
It'll be in XD3

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
You think all the way to XD3?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I think it's XD3 because localization doesn't take that long

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
And because they want to have something saying

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Hey, you know, we haven't forgotten about you

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Because the whole point is they're gonna try to

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Let the hardcore gamers know

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
We haven't forgotten about you

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
That's why you need to buy our new system

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
So, I mean, granted, those are Wii games

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
But they still play on the new Wii U system

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
But that's kind of the whole theme

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
They're gonna be trying

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Because they need that hardcore crowd

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Because the casual gamer doesn't give a shit about their new system

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
I mean, eventually they will because of the touchscreen thing

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
But it's gonna be convincing these people

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
That really bought the system for Wii Sports

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
And Wii Sports Resort and maybe Mario Kart or something like that

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Why they need to go out and buy another system

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Well, I mean, Nintendo doesn't just have to have

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
One press conference a year, though

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I don't see anything stopping Nintendo from

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Thinking again what you said last week about

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
They'll come out and say

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Except you said it a lot more angry

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
You know, the fans demanded it and here it is

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
You know, there's no reason they couldn't do this big thing

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
At Nintendo World in New York City

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Where they'll have a big press conference

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
And invite people to play the games in for the first time

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Because it's what you the gamer wanted

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And we listened because we're the company that

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Loves our fans

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
They're just

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I mean, I don't know

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
They could have easily phrased it away without

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Because what's the point in saying, you know

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Why even say

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
No, it's not something that we're working on right now

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Here's an important point from Dark Tetsuya

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
In our chatroom at chat.orangesonsready.com

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
C goes back to when they said

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Not at this time

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Is it possible that the intern that updates Facebook

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Perhaps just, you know, had to say something

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
But realized they couldn't exactly

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Spoil an upcoming press conference

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
No, they don't have to say anything

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
And if it is E3

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Why do they even have to say anything

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I mean, let's put it this way

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
They went out during E3

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
And said, hey, we're gonna work on a Smash Bros game

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
I mean, we haven't started working on a Smash Bros game yet

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
But we will eventually work on

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I mean, if they're gonna announce stuff

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
That we will eventually work on

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Versus something that they maybe

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Just started working on or something that they're planning on

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Why can't they say, hey, you know what fans

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
You're right, we are gonna be

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Bringing these games over to

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
North America, stay tuned for more information

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
That's all they had to do

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
People wouldn't have been pissed

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
They could still announce all their stuff at, you know, E3

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And say, hey, you know what, we heard you guys

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Without looking like complete assholes

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
At the same time

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
But no, they decided, hey, we're just gonna say

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
No, we don't have any plans to do that

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
And then everyone gets pissed off at them

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I kinda think the intern just did what they had to do

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
And, you know

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, then they should come out

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
They have an opportunity to update at any time

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Hey, you know what, word is actually

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
We are gonna be bringing these over

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
You know, stay tuned for more details

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Now, here's a thought from

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Black Wolf, who's in our chat room

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
And I actually think this is a great idea

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
How about PAX?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Reggie comes out at PAX and says, here's your game, bitches

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
And Breakman follows that up with

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Then he bitch slaps everyone

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But are they doing any

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Sort of press conference at PAX?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
PAX doesn't usually have press conferences

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
But PAX, they will probably have a presence

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
On the show floor, usually the Washington

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Cause PAX is up in Seattle

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
At the time anyway

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
And they're right in the backyard of Microsoft and Nintendo

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So there's no reason

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I remember the one year we all went to PAX

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I believe that had been the first time that

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Animal Crossing was shown out on the floor

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I don't think it had made E3 that year

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
My memory is a little bit fuzzy

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
But I seem to remember there was something on the floor that year

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
That actually was new for Nintendo

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
That they had not shown at E3

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
And PAX being the whole fan service

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Expo, and you know

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Delivering what the fans want

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Would actually seem like

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
The perfect idea

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I think that's a great idea from Bobby

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
The only thing that I think

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Might be a little bit, maybe not

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Is that it's a little soon

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
But it could also kind of add up to this bigger equation

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
That maybe Nintendo wanted to make

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
E3 all about

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
You know, these games

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And they want to make PAX about the other stuff

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
It sounds like PAX would make more sense because

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
If they're localizing this stuff for Europe already

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Localizing it for the United States

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
North America is

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I mean, they've already done all the voice and

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Translation work

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I don't think that they really need to do anything

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I think all they have to worry about is the NTSC versus PAL

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
That's the stuff they have to worry about

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Not just rendering, I mean that

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
High def, it doesn't matter anyways

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Or 480p

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
It's the Wii

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
It doesn't matter, okay, let me put it this way

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Your Wii will interpret it any way

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
It doesn't matter

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I don't know

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
They could have done it in a more

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
You know

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Polite way without ruining any surprises

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I mean, they could just say, stay tuned for more details

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
And they'll be like, oh, here it is

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
It just wouldn't surprise me if there's that whole

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Corporate, you know, like

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
We make the plan in January

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Of 2011 for

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Here's the marketing for the entire year

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
And we're going to announce this game

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
At this expo and this, and we have a tight calendar

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Of who's going to what expo to show, what game

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
You know, this stuff is just mapped out a year in advance

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And the interns know

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
That update Facebook, I better stick to

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
The schedule, you know, I can't

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Or they may not even know themselves

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
But as we're going to get into more information

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
That's not true

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
We know that's not true, they've come out and said that

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
That's not true because of certain factors that play into

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Certain things

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
And you can't just stick to a strict schedule

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Anyways, because you don't know what's going to happen

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I guess that's true

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And if you have a bunch of people that are rabid fans over something

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
And you are planning on doing this

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
With a bone or something like that to keep them interested

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
So they're not thinking, oh well, Nintendo's abandoned

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Me, you know, well screw them

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I'm going to move on

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And, I mean

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I don't know

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Alright, let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
The video games we have been playing this week

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
The stuff that has been released in America

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Unless you guys are playing import games this week

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Which is certainly possible

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
It was a little more eventful

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I played that game that you sent me

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Terrarium

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Terraria I think

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
It's pretty

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It's pretty fun so far

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
But it's still Horizontal Minecraft

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I dug a lot of holes

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
And died a lot

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
And popped slimes with pickaxe

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I played some WoW

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
One

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Item level

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Stupid Firelands

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
What else did I do?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I played Portal 2

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Some more today

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
And I played Droplets the other night

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
What do you do in Portal 2

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
On all your replays

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Are you going through for achievements

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Or are you just trying to get your speed better

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I've done all of the single player achievements

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Except for one of the speed levels

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
But mostly I just go through

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Because it's fun

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I just keep playing it

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I like watching your favorite movie

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I played

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Some Doom 2

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
That's kind of random

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Yeah it's not

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
As good as I remember

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
But it's still fun

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I still remember a lot of my cheats

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
IDGAF

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
IDGAF

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
IDKFA

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
You know

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I just remember in Doom

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
When you could make the screen

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
You could adjust the screen size

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
To get your computer to render it better

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
For older systems

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
My 386 or my 486 100

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I don't even remember it so long ago

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I had to put the window at the minimum size

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
To get it to run decently

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
It was this little tiny window on my screen

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
It's like trying to play a Game Boy

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
On my computer screen

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I just always remember liking the

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Names of the levels like Hurt Me Plenty

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
And all that

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
That was my favorite one

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I found out that I can't play Hexen anymore

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I really can't

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Which is the motion sickness of the first person

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
No it's just not great anymore

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Aww how sad

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I know but I still remember my codes for that too

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Like God Mode was Satan

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And NRA

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Was all weapons

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Are you picking up these games

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
For Steam sale?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Well I already had Hexen

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
But I picked up the Doom Pack

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I'm so mad I missed that

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
The Doom Pack was 8 bucks

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I missed the Quake Pack when it was on sale

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Yeah it's probably still a good deal

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
At 20 bucks but there's just something about the whole

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
You're getting it at a really good deal

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Steam sales are so dangerous

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm telling you when we get to my gaming week

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I wish I put out all the sim stuff cheap

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Just wait Rob

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I'm sure it'll go on sale again once Rage comes out

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Oh it will I'm sure

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I'll wait for the sale

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I have plenty to hold me over

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
For months

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Anyhow Dark Soccer

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Well I tried to play DAC again

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I check DAC

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
And I always keep forgetting that I need a controller to play it

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
So I'm like

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Just grab one of the Xbox controllers one day

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
There you go

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Alright

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Loki! How was your gaming week?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I didn't play a whole lot

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
It was mainly just Grand Theft Auto this week

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Rockstar Games decided to finally

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
After I don't know how many years

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Well a couple years now

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
To patch the mods again for Grand Theft Auto

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Now they didn't patch everything

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
They patched it kind of like the way they did with 4wares

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Mainly everything that

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I mean most of the things that you could use

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I guess to grief other players

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Like they patched all the weapon mods

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Some other random stuff which is kind of lame

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
But I still can do like vehicle mods

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
If we wanted to and the map mods

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Which is kind of cool because I'm still working on something for that

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
So

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
We went back to playing regular

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Ballad of Gay Tony Deathmatch

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Again and I'm trying to work my way

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Up the leaderboards again

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Since I haven't played in a while

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
And a lot more people are playing my ranks drop

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Pretty significantly but

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Still you know

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Out of like 200,000

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Plus players you know being like

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
85 is not bad

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
So

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
You know just still working on getting

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Up there

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I was at one point trying to beat this

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Player named Chuck Norris just because it would be funny

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Because you know you have to defeat Chuck Norris

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
But now he's gone so

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Chevy Chase

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I'm after you

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
A little bit of Earth Defense Force

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
That was pretty much it this week really didn't play a whole lot

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Alright

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
My gaming week

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Let's see I

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I found that Steam sale

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
To be very dangerous that whole thing that they're doing

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
This week and I have easily dropped

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
40 to 50 dollars

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
On games which is exactly what they want

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
People to do that's the whole trick behind it

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Man I got to say I picked up a lot of good stuff

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
So here's some of the stuff I've played this week

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
One of my favorites

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
And it's one of those things where I've known

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
About this game for the longest time and I hear

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Good things about it and I just for whatever

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Reason have never played it I'm just

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Too busy playing WoW or something on the

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Xbox or what have you and I always

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Neglect to look at this game but I finally picked up

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Beat Hazard which is

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
A game that's available on Steam and it's on sale

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
There's this whole combo pack going on

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Right now where it's Beat Hazard, Ultra

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
And all this other stuff

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Basically in a nutshell imagine if

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Like Geometry Wars

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Kind of met a game where you

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Could put your own music

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
In and then add

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Super seizure robots to the whole thing

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
That's what Beat Hazard is

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Look I usually

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Am not the photo sensitive type and

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
You know I don't usually have reactions

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
To video games but I got to say in playing

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Beat Hazard I seriously think

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I felt a little odd playing

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
It like I was like you know I'm not usually

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Prone to this type of stuff but this game is gonna

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Do it like if any game is gonna set me

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Off and cause me to have a seizure it's probably

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Gonna be this game

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
If you haven't played the game you know

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
You're this little ship and the way it controls

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Is kind of interesting on the computer because

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You use your mouse to target

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Things and use the button to shoot

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
On your mouse but you use WASD

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
To move your ship so it's kind of a neat

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Little control system you know it takes the place

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Of two thumb sticks which you know I'm sure

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
You would use if I plugged in a controller but I

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Kind of like the whole WASD and using

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Your mouse to shoot and

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Basically you can load your own

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
MP3's or iTunes songs

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Or you can use like the 20 some

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Odd songs that are just a part of the game by

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Default all kind of techno

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Trancy Ravey songs or

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
You can play the Lady Gaga songs like I did which is

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Actually a lot of fun and the

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Ships kind of

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I guess are generated based on the music

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
But the speed is kind of

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Driven by the music and most

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Importantly kind of the pulse

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Of the bullets and the background

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
And everything is driven by the beats of the game

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
And a lot of your power ups are based around

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Volume you can the

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Basically the more powerful you are the louder

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
The song gets which is kind of cool

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
So yeah you know for

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
About I think I paid about

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Like six bucks for the whole thing I don't

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
It was a pretty good deal so

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Very happy with that

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Some of the other games I've bought

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
During this sale

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Arkon I had no

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Idea that the classic 80's

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Commodore 64 slash

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
NES game Arkon was

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Now on PC until

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Believe it was Travis

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
From under sedation live

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Mentioned it to me on Twitter that

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Arkon was available on the iPhone

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And I was like oh snap there's like this

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Whole iPhone game out there and it kind of had me thinking

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
If they've done it for the iPhone I wonder if there's a new

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
PC version so I searched for Arkon

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Arkon on Steam and sure enough

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
A brand new Arkon game has been released

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
And I'm like just mind blown

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
How long has this game been out

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
And I didn't even know about it and I used to love this game

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Back in the day so I bought the new one and I haven't

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Played enough of it yet where I could really tell you a lot

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
About it but I will say

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I played through at least the tutorial mode

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And it's definitely the old school Arkon

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I'm just hoping there's the online

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Play and all that I haven't again I've played

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Like maybe 15 minutes of this

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Before I got distracted with something else

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
So I'll try to play more over the next week

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
And what have you

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelaunge.com

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Kaijuto says

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Beat Hazard will blow your eye sockets

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I played the demo and it almost

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Killed me now to be fair

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
You can turn down the intensity

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Of the effects but who wants

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
To do that

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I will say this as well

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
One thing I love about Beat Hazard

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Is that there's just

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
For what is a pretty simple concept

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
They've poured a lot of

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Replayability factors into the game

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
In the way of like power-ups

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
And achievements

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Like the more you level through

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
And the more songs you play

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
You get power-ups

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
That you can permanently buy for your ship

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And then you can you know pick

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Like five of the power-ups for your ship for a song

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
And a lot of times what the power-ups

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Do is they do things to your ship to increase

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Either survivability or score

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
So if you're the type that wants to go for the

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Highest score possible amongst your friends

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
You use the

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Enhancements that you unlock the more you play

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
To get that and I just think

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
That's kind of a neat way to do it

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
And what kind of really enhances

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
The playability of what's otherwise a

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Very simple game

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I was gifted Plants vs. Zombies

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
By our listener

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
XLink who was on Horde House a couple weeks ago

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
It's kind of like a late birthday present

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
And finally

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I know Dark Soccer is a huge fan of Plants vs. Zombies

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Yes I am

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
And I've played the game before

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I've played the free one online but

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Now I have the PC version and I was playing that

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
For a little bit and perfecting

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
My strategy against zombies I didn't realize

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
There was a whole little mode where you could create

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Your own zombie and then like that zombie

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Will show up in the final wave as you play the game

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Oh that was kind of cool

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I think if you do more than one though both of them can show up

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Oh really? I always did the one

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Not the point of it at first was just to make

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
A little

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Avatar that you could use on

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Instant Messenger or on web forums and stuff

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Which is actually a really smart idea

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
To try and get the game exposed

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
And I'm surprised more people haven't kind of hopped

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
On that train where like

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Let people make a custom avatar from your game

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Which

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Okay now I'm sounding kind of stupid because that's what

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The Xbox 360 avatar stuff is all about

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
But I guess this is the first time I've kind of seen it in a PC

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Fashion and kind of let them

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Spread the word about the game

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Like I think it would be a great idea for like the next Elder Scrolls game

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
On PC to do is let me make a little

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Avatar on my character and then I could use it on

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Web forums and stuff I don't know

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Something like that

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
That's kind of neat I hope they have something like that for Saints Bros. III

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Because they know they're going to be putting out their

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Character creator slightly early before the game

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
That would be kind of cool to have

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
You know

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Your character on the avatar

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
So I've bought some games see here's the other

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Dangerous thing about the Steam sale

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I've bought games I haven't even freaking

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Played yet and one of the games I

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Bought was Amnesia

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Which is supposed to be just like

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
A horrifically

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Scary game like I was even

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Scared by the trailer

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
It's like seriously like a scare the pants

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Off of you game don't play this in the dark

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Type of thing so I'm excited

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
To check out Amnesia do you know much about this game

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Dark Soccer because you like the survival horror stuff

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Go look at the trailer on there for Amnesia

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
You have to tell me if you think it's scary

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Or not so alright

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
That's all I'll say about my

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Gaming week otherwise it's been the other stuff

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Final Fantasy 13

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I think I'm up to like 30

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Hours 35 hours spent

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
In the game I think I'm getting

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Closer to the end I'm still in chapter 11

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Because I've been doing crap ton of sidequests

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
But getting

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Closer to the end I'm back in the main story now

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I'm climbing a big tower for those

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Of you that know the game and probably

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Ring a bell to some of you

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Are you running up that hill?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Yes I'm running up that hill

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
To make a deal with a foul C

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
And convince them to swap our places

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Let's see

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And then you know Warcraft

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
And all that other fun stuff alright

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
That's it for my gaming week

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I had no life on the weekends

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
But the show has changed and gone through

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Some different host line ups and so forth

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
But what's funny is it's kind of back

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
To a very classic line up it's Travis and Jessica

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And kind of one of the earliest

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Line ups of under sedation live was myself

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Travis and Jessica so

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
The show is just missing me but I'm going to be back

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
On Saturday

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
To say hello for the 10th anniversary

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Happy 10th anniversary

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
And I know it's just going to be Travis dogging me

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
For 3 hours but

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
That's ok we gave him a little fodder

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
He's not great

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
After 10 years of hard work I

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Suppose he's earned it

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
But

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Not that I'm going to go

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Quietly that's what I'm going to say about

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
That I'm a lot bitchier now

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Than I was 10 years ago

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
No seriously though it'll be fun

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
So check that out Saturday night at all

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Games radio more information understationlive.org

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Now we can get into some gaming

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
News let's talk about what's going on in the

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Gaming industry this week and get your thoughts

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Live in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And on the skype line later on

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Loki start us off

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Ah yes square enix was a little bit sad

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
After their game Deus Ex

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Human Revolution has

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Been leaked out to

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
The public

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Apparently preview code for the game

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Which was hosted on steam

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
The account was hacked

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
It was a game preview

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Code meant for

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
People in the

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Preview review program

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Kind of for the press

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
And one of the outlets I guess

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
It's a french outlet

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
And their account got hacked

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
And this game was downloaded

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
And then of course it spread out there

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Kind of like wildfire

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Right now they're going after 15

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Unnamed John Does and seeking

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Monetary damage in excess of

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
$5,000 for the

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Preview's distribution

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Now the game wasn't finished

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
But it was kind of a preview build

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
That leaked out there

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
And obviously this is not the first time

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Something like this has happened

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
This is 2, same thing happened to that

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
And god how many other games

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Preview builds get leaked out for

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
A lot

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
But they're none too happy about that

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Interesting

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Um

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Steam's supposed to be like

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
The super secure thing

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
And it's interesting that the game

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Kind of leaked off of it

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
When it sounds like this might be more

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Of like an error

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Or some sort

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
It was an Italian gaming outlet

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
That leaked that out

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Or that the account got hacked from

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Not Steam then to clarify

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
It seems to be kind of

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Confusing where it's come from

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It seems that even Square doesn't know yet

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Rather than aim its suit at the

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Italian gaming outlet

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
The Japanese publisher is instead

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Directing its legal team at the 15

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
People that stole the game

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Or I guess that are

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Distributing the game

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
It takes 15 people to

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Download a game

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
They don't know who they are because it's gonna be 15 IP addresses

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Pretty much, yeah

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
What do you think

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
About a case like this? Do you think Square

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Has a case against these folks?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
If they can track them down

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Because they hacked into someone's account

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
So the crime that's committed

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Is impersonating someone else's account

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
To get the game

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
We'll see

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
But what if those people come back and say

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I don't have my IP

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I wasn't driving

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Somebody hacked into my Wi-Fi

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
That's the problem

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Because it is the burden of proof

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
They need to have the proof that they did it

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
And just seeing that you have your IP

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
People can spoof IPs easy

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Especially if they're smart

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
If these people are

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
The smart hacker types

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Obviously they're gonna be running their

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
IP through proxies and stuff like that

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
So it'll be even more difficult to track them down

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I gotta ask you about this

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Not to get too tangent-y

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
But since you brought up the whole IP spoofing

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
It made me think of this, a big article I read this week

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
What do you think about this whole

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Agreement that I'm hearing

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
That was passed this week between the major

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
ISPs including

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Comcast, AT&T, and a bunch of the other big ones

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And copyright holders, essentially

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Where there's the whole

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
We are going to

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Notify users when IPs are identified

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
But if it's

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Which is kind of what was already being done

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
But now I think it's more streamlined

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
And consistent between all the companies

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
And if a user

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Keeps ignoring the alerts

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
They will get pop-ups that they have to

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Acknowledge

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Or they might even get phone calls at some point

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I don't know, I haven't obviously read too far into this

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
I don't know, what do you think

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
About this whole thing?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Well, there's a couple things that are

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Weird about it

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
One, it would have to be

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
The way I understood it was

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I believe

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
It's going to be like, for example, if you were

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Downloading TV episodes or something like that

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Of BitTorrent or something, and they figured out

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
That you were doing it, or your IP

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Was attached to it, they would notify you

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
To make sure that, you know, it's not

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Say, someone

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Jumping onto your Wi-Fi or something like that

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
They would notify you

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
That that's going on, if you ignore

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
That, and then they keep sending you

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Notices and eventually, you know, they will start

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Throttling your internet and whatnot

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
But the problem is

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I don't think that actual Comcast

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Or something like that are monitoring traffic

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I mean, it would be very difficult for them to figure out

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
What you're downloading

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Well, the copyright holders will

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I'm assuming that what they do

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Is they seek out the

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Torrent, and they download it

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
And they can see all the IPs that are sharing it

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
And so they send

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Requests to the ISPs

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Of all those IP addresses

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
So, I mean, you can

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
There's a way

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
That you can get around with them

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Tracking where you're actually browsing

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
But for one, using

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
A DNS that's not

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Provided by your ISP

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
You can use 4221

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Or whatever is one of those

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
You can

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I think they have ways

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
You can even download BitTorrent

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Via

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Proxy or something like that

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
And you know what?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
There's other options out there other than BitTorrent

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I mean, not just BitTorrent

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
But there's newsgroups

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
And there's

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Just plain straight up hosting

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
A file on one of the file sharing sites

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Like MegaUpload or

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
RapidShare

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
MediaFire, whatever

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
So do you think this is going to be another case of

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
The piracy will just evolve like it did when Napster got shut down?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I don't think it's really

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I don't think anything is really changing too much

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
They're starting to

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
They're kind of doing it to scare people

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
To get them saying

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
We're going to be watching what you're doing

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
But once again

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And that's just if you're interested in

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Stealing music or

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Music or TV

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Or something like that

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I don't think game publishers

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
PC publishers are really

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Going out there hunting these people down

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
There's a lot of stuff out there that's still going to get pirated

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
But you know what?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
If you look at the NPA and the NPA

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Two people that are backing this

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Of course they're supporting it

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Because all the backers you'll notice

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Are just all the NPA, the RIA

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
And all the film

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
And music studios and stuff like that

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
You don't see any

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Well the thing that surprised me most

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
About the law was this whole fact that

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
If you want to dispute it

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
You can, but you have to pay

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
$35

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
To have that investigated

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Something about that kind of struck me as wrong

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Like I don't like the fact that

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
You know, and granted

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I try to have a secure setup in my home

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
And all this stuff, but there's just something about

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
My grandma

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Who wouldn't know how to do all that stuff

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Where somebody else probably set it up

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
For her that may not have done it

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
If somebody steals that wifi

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
She would have to pay $35

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
To have that investigated, something strikes me as really

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Wrong about that

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
If any company asked me to

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Pay $35, I would just drop them

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Bill, yep, you know what

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
What if you have no other options in your neighborhood?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I have to use one particular ISP

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
In my neighborhood, and I have no

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Other options, unless I want to go to DSL

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Which I really don't want to do

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I don't really know what you could do

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
I don't know either

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
That's a sticking point for me

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I mean, I don't

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I don't really pirate games

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I don't pirate games

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
The last time I would ever pirate a game was

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Back in the Playstation 1 days

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I would do import games

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
I would, you know,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Download some of those online

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Because I felt it was kind of unfair that if the publishers

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Do not plan to release the games in this country anyway

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Then what

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
You know, I'm not gonna pay the outrageous fees

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Which at that time were like sometimes

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
$70, $80 to own the game

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I'll leave that to collectors that want that stuff

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Blink, blink

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
But, you know, I'm not gonna get

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
On a moral soapbox about it or what have you

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
You know, it's just the way it is

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
But, if I'm gonna

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Download like last night's episode

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Of The Voice

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Like, really?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I'm gonna get

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
My ISP shut off over that

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Like, it just kind of stinks

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I don't know

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
A little ridiculous

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
If it ends up being

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Where they're gonna be tracking you in a very simple

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Fashion like you said, you know, where they've

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Downloaded the torrent and

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
They do it in a way that

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
You know, they can see all your IPs

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
What's gonna end up having is a few things

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
One, people are just gonna stop

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Listing the torrent as, you know,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
The voice episode, blah, blah, blah

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
It'll be just some random gibberish

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
They're gonna start, you know,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Putting stuff behind, you know

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Membership sites or something like that

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Where you have to, you know,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Be a member of the site to find these torrents

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Or something like that

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
There's ways around everything

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
But, you know, as soon as they figure out

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
What they're doing to find these people

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Or whatever, there will be new programs

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
There will be new

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Protocols, whatever, that people will develop

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
In order to get around it

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
They're already renaming torrent files

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
With like

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Weird spaces between letters

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
And special characters and things

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
So

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
You know, you'd be surprised

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
They are going after

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Like, some TV show watchers

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Who was it in chat said they got a letter

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
About Game of Thrones? Oh, there it is, Rama

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I got a notice the other week about someone in my house

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Downloading Game of Thrones

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Granted, that's an HBO show and HBO is a pay network

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
I mean, I sort of see where they

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I mean, that is a huge

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Because they make a lot of money off the DVD sales and so forth

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
So I can kind of see why they are very

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Rampant about trying to block

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
The

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Downloading of the shows, but like, the over-air networks

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Is the ones that, like

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
And I don't know

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
What other extents they've gone to protect their stuff

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I mean, I have nothing, I just

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I hope it doesn't become that, you know

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I'll say right now, I download Supernatural

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Because I hate watching commercials

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
And so I'll just watch it on my computer

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
But I also own

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Like, several of the box sets of the seasons anyway

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Okay, because I was going to say

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Devil's Advocate

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Commercials are what make the TV shows free

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
But I also

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Have the box sets

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
And a bunch of merchandise

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I have the comics

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
You could probably watch them all on Netflix anyway

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Probably

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
But, I mean, regardless

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
There's episodes

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I believe up on WB's

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Not WB, why am I saying WB?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
It's a

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
CW

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
CW, yeah, on their website

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
So, I mean, it's not like it's a big deal

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
I just hate commercials

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Now it's all about product placement

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
That's why we have more product placement games

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I still watch my Doctor Who

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Some of the old episodes of How I Met Your Mother

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
And stuff like that, where they're digitally altering them now

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Where they're adding TVs and stuff in the background

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
With stuff on them for different movies

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Yeah, there's reruns of

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Some of the 2009 episodes are like that

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
With The Zookeeper in the background

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Or

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
What is it, Country Strong or something like that

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Huh, I hadn't heard about that

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
God, you

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Nothing in the world would get me to go see The Zookeeper

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Like, maybe if someone threatened

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
To kill my family

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
If I wouldn't go watch the movie

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I guess I would have to go see the movie

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
You'd have to debate how much you love your family

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
There would be that moment of pause

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
But

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
I mean, seriously

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
That movie looks so awful

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I can't even

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Anyhow, real quick

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Before we start jumping back into actual

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Pertinent information

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Have you seen the trailer for Jack and Juliet?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
I don't think so

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
It's a new Adam Sandler movie where he plays

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Both Jack and Jill

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
No, I haven't heard that

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
You think The Zookeeper looks bad

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Uh, there

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Does he have sex with himself? Because Divine did that

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
In the 70s

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
No, no, no

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
But it looks fucking terrible

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Alright, let's get back to game stuff, sorry

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
How about the Wii U? Wii U

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Talking about why was the Wii U

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Showing, you know, a lot of folks at E3

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
And I think I had said this too

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Who was showing what said

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Nintendo, maybe Nintendo did this too early

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Maybe they should have just waited until they actually had

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
A little bit more to show, like, I don't know, some actual

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Games and not just a bunch of concepts

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Well

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Has said that, you know what, maybe

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Nintendo did show the Wii earlier

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Than they had planned due to

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
An increased fear

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Of leaks

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
What do you mean fear of leaks? There were already leaks

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
I know, right?

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
But more could they have possibly leaked out about that system

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Here's a quote

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
In the past, when Nintendo did not receive as much attention

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
As we do now, we did not have to worry

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
About the spread of our confidential information

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Since it did not have any value in society

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
But since the Nintendo DS and the Wii

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Created a social phenomenon

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
I like how they kind of just slipped that in there

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Please

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Social phenomenon

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
But it's actually blowing smoke up their own ass

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Like, that's literally what they're doing in that statement

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
You know, since we

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Decided that, you know, our systems

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Are just revolutionizing the world

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
In fact, you know, we would go as far as saying

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
They're about to cure cancer

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
But, you know, hey

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
That's what the fans

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Are saying about our system

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Why doesn't he just say, thanks

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
To the internet? Because back in

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
The day, you know, you would get the word

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
From the Nintendo Fun Club

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Or Nintendo Power, which ironically enough

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Were also both Nintendo

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
You have to understand, because we're so awesome now

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Let me show you this graphic behind me here

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You see right here, we were awesome

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
But now we are, like, ten times as awesome

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
You do understand, that is

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Way more awesome than we were before

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Therefore, we have to show the Wii U early

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Alright, look, I gotta

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Let me read the rest of the statement here

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Because I'm too hung up on this whole

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Now, if this starts to be confusing

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I have a pie chart, too

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Nintendo used to have value

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Nintendo now has value in society

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Anyhow

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Nintendo's next move

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Commands great attention and

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Extreme news value

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Therefore, although we go to great lengths

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
To ensure that this will not happen

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
There are cases where, even if a person

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Receives information under a non-disclosure agreement

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
The information is leaked because there is

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Great temptation

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Even for the Wii U, some people may be aware

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
If they had been checking the internet

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
That information with true and false rumors

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Mixed together was spread on the internet before the announcement

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
So they kind of admit that

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Yeah, some of it was out there

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Therefore, as for new hardware

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Even if we wanted to, it is extremely challenging

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
To realize the situation where a product

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Is announced and then launched the next day

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
So, let's summarize

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
That quote in our own words

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Because we are so fucking awesome

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
That everybody wants to report on our

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Farts, and has reported

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
On our farts

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
We had to, you left us no choice

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
But to get up on the E3

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Stage and fart

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
They didn't have to

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Wii U

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Wii U

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Wii U

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Here's the thing, they don't have to do shit

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
They don't have to do anything

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
They're succumbing to peer pressure

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
That's because they're farting

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
I mean, seriously, they don't have to do any

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
If people think that you're releasing a new system

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
You can either tell them, yeah, we're releasing a new system

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Or you can just say, I'm not telling you shit

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I mean, what are they gonna do?

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Speculate all they want, but that's all it's gonna be

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Is speculation, and you know what you need to do

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Is you need to fucking clamp down on all those people

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
That are violating your goddamn NDA

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
When some press outlet says

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Hey, I heard that the Wii U has a tablet

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
For a controller, then you tell them

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Well, you ain't gonna see shit anymore

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
About Nintendo stuff because you violated

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Your NDA, you dumbass

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
That's all they gotta do, oh, it's so difficult

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
To secure my information

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Gee, if only there were a way I could

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I don't know, get people to follow my NDA

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Maybe if you

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
It's called a guillotine

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
It's called repercussions for people violating your NDA

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
That's why you have a non-disclosure agreement

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Take those fuckers to court

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
It's in there

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I mean, come on, it's like

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
You know

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Oh, you wanna learn about the new Pokemon game?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Too bad, cause you're gonna have to wait until after retail

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Was Nintendo really worried

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
About disappointing at E3 this year

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Because, like, seriously, Reggie could've just

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Reggie could've got up on stage

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
And just hula-hooped for 30 minutes

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
And there would be that analysis

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
On X-Play, like Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
So, the Wii hoop

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Wasn't that an interesting display

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Of, you know, technology

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Of pelvis shaking from someone

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Who doesn't need to shake his pelvis

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I give those pelvic thrusts a 4 out of 5

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Rob, if they didn't talk about the Wii U

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
What the fuck would they have talked about

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Cause, seriously, they had nothing to announce

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
This year, they had nothing

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
It was like, hey, yeah, well, we've got

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
No, they could've

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Stretched the fuck out of those discussions

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Of the Wii games that they didn't

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Really show, like Rhythm Heaven

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
And all the stuff that we poo-poo

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
And would they have gotten slammed for that?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Probably, but then they could've shown the trailer

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
For the last story

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Or Xenoblade, which we all think is happening anyway

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
I think most of us going into E3

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Were pretty convinced that Nintendo was gonna show

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
The last story for an American release

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Why is it so difficult if they're planning on

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Working on that anyways, or they're planning on bringing that over

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
That they couldn't announce that

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Even if, you know what, they decide, hey, you know what

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
We're not gonna bring it over here at some point

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
If they change their minds, they can do that

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Games get cancelled all the time

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Look at True Crime, you know, Hong Kong

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
There's a big ol' trailer for that during Activision's conference

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
You know, a couple years ago

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
But that game got cancelled

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Yeah, it sucks that it got cancelled, but you know what

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Games get cancelled, so if they decide, hey

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
We can announce this, but there may be a chance

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
That we're not gonna bring it over here

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
So what?

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
They're gonna announce, instead of saying, hey

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I hear you guys like Smash Brothers

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Well guess what, we're gonna work on Smash Brothers

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Sometime

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
In the next couple years

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
It's like, thanks

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I think

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Game guru in our chat room

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
At chat.ownerswanttrader.com says

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
They could've focused on the 3DS

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
You know, and they kinda did for half their conference

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Their conference this year was the Zelda thing

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Which, that did feel like a bunch of hot air

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Like, I'm sorry, but the whole Zelda thing

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
It's like, okay, you've been showing this game for like four years

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
And the whole symphony thing

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
And all that was really just dragging it out

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Like, we know you're fucking showing the Wii U

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
This is just, you know

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
This is literally just pomp and circumstance

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
About how fucking great Nintendo is

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
But here's the great thing about Nintendo

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
They could've done pomp and circumstance

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Like, they could've done, like, symphonic

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Announcements for all those 3DS games

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Like, they could've had somebody dressed up as

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
They could've had Rama, Black Luigi

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Come out and go, hello

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
And look where it goes

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Miyamoto with the fucking shield and sword

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I mean, that's like, just like

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
That's the kind of crazy bat shit

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Stuff that they need to be doing again

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
To get people excited about the games

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
I'm sorry, you know what

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Every time I see them put out a new

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Mario Kart and Animal Crossing game or something like that

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I mean, really, what the fuck are they doing?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
They're adding some more useless garbage

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
On top of these games

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
And then they're re-releasing them back out into the market

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Or, hey, look, I know you guys wanted

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Star Fox, so we're gonna give you Star Fox

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
That we gave you before

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Awesome!

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Hey, I hear you guys like Mario Brothers

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
We're gonna give you Mario Brothers 64 HD

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Or in 3D

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Thanks?

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I mean, it's just

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
It's kind of annoying that they've got, I mean

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
To me, there's

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
I understand that, you know, there's a whole place

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Where, hey, you know what, these games are good

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Let's re-release them for a new generation

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Or some garbage that you wanna spew

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
That basically, oh, well, we've run out of ideas

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
So we're just gonna take some of these old games

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
And, you know, put them back out again

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
We're gonna put as minimal amount of effort into them

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
To make them look new again, but we're gonna put them

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Back out there, because this is what the fans want

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
You know what?

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Fans

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Let me just talk to you here real quick

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Here's something that you can do, guess what

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
You know that those consoles

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
When people are done playing them

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
They're still out there

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
I mean, they don't just, like, evaporate

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
They are out there

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
I thought they were on the landfill in New Mexico

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
I know, it's so crazy

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Did you know that if you wanna play

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Oak Green Up Time, you don't have to spend

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
$299 plus, you know,

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
$40 for the game

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Yes, I know, this is a shocker

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
That's not what Beyonce told me in the ad

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I understand, but Beyonce's full of shit

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Here's all you have to do

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
You can literally go out to your local

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Garage sales, or

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
There's this website out there called eBay

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Where people sell things

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
This is a game that Robin Williams named his daughter after

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Isn't that worth $300?

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Yeah, but Robin Williams is kinda crazy

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Didn't you see the crazy beard?

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
It's starting to look like a homeless crazy beard

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I see where you're going with that

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
It's beyond Santa Claus

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
So, you can go on eBay

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
And you can buy a Nintendo 64

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
And Oak Green Up Time

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
And guess what?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Just be careful that it's not coming from China

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
For a limited amount of time

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
It's within that $299 price range

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
About, I don't know,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
40 other games!

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
And you can play it

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
All on your

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
You can buy everything on the Steam Marketplace right now

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
For $299

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
And you can play it, and yes, it won't be in 3D

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
But you know what?

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Actually, wrong

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
It doesn't matter, because you know what?

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
You're playing with it

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
The way it was meant to be played on Nintendo 64

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I don't understand why

49:46.000 --> 49:52.000
That's the whole thing with the 25th anniversary collection or whatever

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
That $40 could have easily bought you

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
$40 could have bought you

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
We need to do a mock commercial for 3DS

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Oak Green Up Time

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
That has the whole interspersed Robin Williams and his daughter

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
And I'll play the game

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
The way it was meant to be played

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Just $1999 on eBay

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
It's not even $1999

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
I don't know

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
It would have been different

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
If it was something like

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Hey, you know what?

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
We're going to bring out a Zelda anthology

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
We're going to have Zelda 1, Zelda 2

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
All of them on one disc

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Like they kind of did for the pre-order thing for Wind Waker

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
It was a pre-order bonus!

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Pre-order bonus!

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Stuff that nowadays is just like a code for a shirt

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
For my character in game

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Or armor that's red instead of silver

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I mean

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Why couldn't they just

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
They could sell that disc

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
They could easily just stuff

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
A couple more games on there

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Put Wind Waker in the box or something like that

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Cause that game hasn't been sold forever

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Throw Twilight Princess back in there

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Because hey, you know what?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
In case someone doesn't have it

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
And a little bit of extra content

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
And holy crap, that's a great deal

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
And actually worth my time

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
And hell, you don't have to do anything to them

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Because people liked the games the way they were

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
But no

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
They need an excuse for people to buy the 3DS

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
It's kind of a gimmicky system

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
And so what a better way to do that

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Is to take one of their most popular Zelda games

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
And just put it back out there

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
With minimal effort

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
There's actually more to this whole Wii U story

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Let's make it a four hour show tonight

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Let's get Loki more to rant about

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
The Wii U apparently will not have a unified online network

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Like Xbox Live or something like that

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
As if these kind of earlier quotes and things

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Are to be read into

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Reggie Fils-Aime

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I guess in a recent interview with Forbes

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Said that Nintendo is

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Quote, creating a much more flexible system

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
That will allow the best approaches

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
By independent publishers

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
To come to bear

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
So instead of a situation where a publisher

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Has their own network and wants

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
That to be the predominant platform

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
And having arguments with platform holders

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
We're going to welcome that

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
We're going to welcome that from the best and the brightest

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Of the third party publishers

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
No, here's the way I look at that

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
We have no plans

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
We're just going to leave it up to you

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
I honestly am reading that as

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
We're looking at the third parties

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
To do the work for us

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I'm sorry, that's what it is

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I'm sure that everybody has trouble

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Working with Xbox Live

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
To me, I don't see any publishers

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Having trouble working with Xbox Live

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
This is funny

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Because this does tie into something topical

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
And it's the whole EA vs. Steam thing

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
That's going on

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
That yes, I realize comes up later in the show

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
There's this whole thing going back and forth

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
With EA and Steam right now

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Where Steam has forbidden the EA games

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
To come on the marketplace

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
For Steam

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
And a lot of it has to do with the fact that EA

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Wants to have their own servers

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
For their own patches

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
And EA wants it all to themselves

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
And this was a big sticking point early on

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
With Microsoft in the early days of Xbox Live

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
So

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Nintendo, in a way, can kind of point at that

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
And say, we're not being lazy

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
We're just doing what EA wants

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
No, they are being lazy, because guess what

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Who did they bring out on stage?

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
EA. But guess what?

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
EA is still doing that, though

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
EA has their own, like, you have to sign in

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Through the EA service or whatever

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
In order to play the EA games online

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Because, remember, Project $10

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
That's all part of that fun stuff

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
And then, same with like

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I think there's some other services

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Ubisoft has their

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Kind of thing where you have to log into

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
As well, but EA, I know for a fact

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
They have their, you know

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
EA games login that you have to do

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
So they have their own thing on top of this

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
The fact that they don't have a unified

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Service or something like that is basically

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Nintendo's way of saying, we don't

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Know what we're doing. I'm sorry, I think that's kind of

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
What it is, because they don't want to invest time

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Into some sort of service like that and have it be

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Inferior. Well, they sort of, and they sort of

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Brought out the guy from EA

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Coincidentally enough, at E3

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
And I got the sense that

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Like, I don't know how much

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I can't remember now how much was said

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
About online, but I remember walking away from that

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Getting the sense that, like I

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Was actually asking myself for a minute, like

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Is EA doing their online stuff?

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Like, is EA going to be doing the online stuff?

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
It wasn't that at all. No, I know that's not what they

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
But that was, like, for a moment, that was the impression

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
I was getting about what was being said

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Because they didn't really bring up their online stuff

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
All it really, to me, said is, hey look

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
We have EA on board, they believe in our system

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
And EA is, you know, one of the

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Biggest publishers in the world

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
So, you all should believe in our system

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
You know, don't you

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
See the math? This is how you, you know

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Because they believe in us, you have to believe in us

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
That, that's

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
It's right here, it's on the chalkboard

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Alright, one more piece of information

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
On the Wii U, and that has to do with

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Demos for the 3DS and Wii U

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Another quote from Satoru

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Iwata in a conversation with investors

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Quote, when Nintendo would like to ask

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Users to try a specific new game

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
We should deliver it to their Nintendo 3DS

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
And possibly Wii U

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
With their prior consent, and recommend

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
That they just try it, and if they like it

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
They can pay for it. In this way, we need to

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Introduce users to unknown products

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Consumers are likely to be

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Convinced to pay about 5,000 yen

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
For a well-established franchise product

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
But not all the people are willing to pay a certain

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Amount of money for an innovative but unknown

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Product. Now is the time to prepare for

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
These situations. So what's interesting about that

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Is Nintendo is basically saying, we need to find

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
A way to just put demos on people's systems

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Now, he does it, now

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
There is a very important quote before you run away

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
With this that says, you know, with their

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Prior consent. They're already doing this, they're already

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Doing this on the 3DS as far as like

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Cause the stupid Pokemon thing downloaded

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
To mine, I'm like, I don't want this fucking shit

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
No, it didn't download automatically, did it? You had to get it through

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
The store. I had to get mine through the store

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
No, mine downloaded automatically. Really?

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I know that OK Go video came in on one of the

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Matches automatically, and then it was taken away

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
But that's not a big deal. I mean, they have the same type of thing

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Right now. In fact, I think it's still around

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
On Xbox Live Arcade. Remember, you could

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Sign up, basically, and have all the demos

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
For the games that come out, you know, download to your system

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
You can try them if you like them, then you buy them

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Well now, this could be a big deal for people

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
That are, I mean, you know, OK, fair enough

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Xbox does it too, but just, you know, throw it out there

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
People that have to watch their bandwidth

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
And, you know, with this whole 250

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Gig bandwidth, some people get close

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
To that with all the HD movies they watch

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Some people don't, maybe don't want all that data

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Coming through. Well, then they don't have to

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Sign up for it, but here's the thing that I think

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Is more interesting is the fact that they're putting out demos

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Say, I mean, Nintendo, a company that

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
They've said, hey, you know what?

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Our games are so awesome

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Remember, chart 10 times awesome as before

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
That we don't need demos

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
For them. We're just gonna, you know,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
We're putting that stuff out there, and you're gonna see Nintendo

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
And you're like, oh, I gotta buy that

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
And so now, they realize

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Hey, you know what? People like playing demos

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
To see if your game's crap

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Or not

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Alright, well

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I like demos and hate crap

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Do you like crappy demos?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
No

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Alright, let's move on with more news

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Well, I like them because I don't have to pay for them

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Dark Soccer, while you're at it, why don't you give us some more gaming news

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Well, how about some Zoonie stuff?

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
There is a rumor that the

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Zoon Marketplace is being revamped

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
On Xbox 360 as a streaming

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Video service

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
And it already had the ability to

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Stream, but this is specifically

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
For some sort of service they're gonna

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Be offering, I believe something along the lines of

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Like Netflix, but this of course

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Is under the Zoon brand

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Microsoft

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Basically saying

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
No comment, blah blah blah

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
But, it could already be happening

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
I mean, this could

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Be related to what they were announcing

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
At E3

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
At their press conference, or maybe related to

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Xbox Live Diamond, who knows

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Like

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Okay, I already have Netflix

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Well, you know

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I already have Hulu

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Xbox has been kind of centralizing a lot of their stuff lately

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
And kind of folding in dated brands

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Like we had the story last week about Game for Windows

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Kind of becoming Xbox.com

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Didn't Xbox stop making the Zoon

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Like about a year and a half ago

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
So, it's no surprise at all that

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Something had to happen to the Zoon Marketplace

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Well, and it makes sense to me because

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
I look at even like the Playstation Network

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
And stuff, they have

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
I don't even know how many streaming services on there

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Sony has one, they have Vudu

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
And Netflix

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
And I'm sure Hulu Plus

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Is on there

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I think there's a few other ones on top of that

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
So it makes sense that they would have a few different offerings

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
On the Xbox Marketplace

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
As well

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
They gotta do something with that Zoon name

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I would, yeah

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
But they're not gonna call it the Zoon

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
They're probably just gonna have some Microsoft streaming

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Service or something like that

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
I don't know

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
This is kind of funny

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Remember how we talked about Gears of War 3 leaking out last week

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Well, who

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Who possibly could have leaked this out

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
But actually

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
It was funny because it was

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Linked out by a

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Third party

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
I guess outsource

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Company that was storing

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
The code on their website

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Codify, they're a

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Australian based hosting company

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Which lists Microsoft as a client

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
And it

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Literally was behind no protection whatsoever

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
All you had to do was go to

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Xbox.codify.com

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Which is now obviously locked up

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
And you can literally

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Find the code right there

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Just go and

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Download the whole

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Folders and everything

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Right for the picking

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
That's just straight up embarrassing

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
That is pretty bad

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Not even a login or password

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
The password wasn't password

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
There's just no password

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
No login, no password

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
There was confidential in the folder

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Oh please

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
That was a dopey thing to do

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Someone's head's rolling for that decision

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
That was just a lazy

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Dumb thing to do

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I don't care what game it was

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
It's an unfortunate result

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And that doesn't make the result right

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
But come on

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
To take no security whatsoever

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Was a horrible decision

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
It is pretty bad

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And clearly this company

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Has no security

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Officer

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Cyber security person

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Specialist

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Clearly this company has none of that

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Or that person has been on vacation for six months

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Dude, I mean, you could seriously

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Go on

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
On any of these file sharing sites

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Hell, they could have used

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Like a site like mega upload

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Or something like that

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
You know, some ridiculously stupid website

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And at least that you can put a password on

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
This site, nothing

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Randy in our chat room says

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Somewhere an employee is being yelled at

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I would say somewhere in a Microsoft meeting

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
An agreement is being terminated

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
With this company

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I would say that

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
It's gonna be a lot more serious

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And then people at that said company

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Are gonna lose their jobs

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
And the sad thing is, it's not gonna be anybody

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Involved with this

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It'll be the fault of the executive

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Who didn't hire a privacy person

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
You know what's funny too

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Not only was the game leaked

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But there was some of the tools that they used for the game as well

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Leaked with it

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
It's awesome

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
It's sad

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Alright

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
The gamers will never go away

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
But we've got to address them because it's making

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
The way around the game blogs

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Let's see

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Taiwan based component makers

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
According to Digitimes

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Have said that

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
The Playstation 4 will feature

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Body movement control

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Similar to Kinect

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And it's going to be released in 2012

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
This is coming from Foxcon

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I'm sorry, it's not coming from

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
The report is further saying

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
That Foxcon and Pegatron technology

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Who make the PS3

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
They will also be working on the Playstation 4

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
The shipment volume of the Playstation 4

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
In 2012 is supposed to be at least 20 million units

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
So there you go

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Supposedly

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
The Playstation 4 is coming out as soon as next year

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
There's a few things

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
That seem a little weird about that

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I mean, very well

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Let's say if it was actually coming out next year

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Then yes, it would probably have to be starting production right now

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
But a few things

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
That seem kind of off on that

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Is the fact that they're looking to ship 20 million units

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I mean, even if it was 20 million units worldwide

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
No console launch

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Has been that big

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Never that big

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And that would be a lot of units just sitting there

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
A lot of wasted resources

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
They're going to want to have that launch

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Basically the numbers

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
As on as possible

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Because you don't want to just have all this

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Hardware sitting there that's not being sold

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Because that's money

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
That you're just pissing away

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So my guess, I mean

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
The best console launch is I would imagine that you could

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Probably push maybe

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Maybe 5 million

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
You know, as a console launch

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Or something like that

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
For something like this

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I mean, that would be a lot

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Just like right away

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So 20 million, that seems wrong

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
The other thing that strikes me as odd

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
About this story is the whole

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
It will feature body movement control

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
To disconnect

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I'm looking at that a little bit through side eye

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Because that would show me that

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Sony has already abandoned the Move

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I wouldn't doubt that they would though

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
That makes sense

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I'm a little yes and no on that

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I mean, the Move definitely probably has not broken through

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
The way it should have

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Or the way that Connect has

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
But at the same time

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
There's a part of me that wants to say

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Connect hasn't really proven itself

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
But at the same time, yes it is the fastest selling

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Like the Connect is in the rut that the Wii was in

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
At the same time, we all should have seen it coming

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
That, you know, after the initial wave of games

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
There's just kind of a bunch of finger tapping

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
On the desk, there's not a lot

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And not a lot that we got excited about at E3 this year

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
There will be some stuff coming out

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But yeah, it's not

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It's not really a lot of stuff that's

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Diverting from what's already out there

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
There's going to be dancing games

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Because obviously those have done well

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
There's going to be sports games because those have done well

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
There's going to be kind of the same type of fairy

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
On like the Wii because that's

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Just what's working

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Yeah, and the other thing you also have to consider too

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Is that

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
They're still making PS3s

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And they're still, you know, the PS3 is

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Going to be their push, especially with the fourth core

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
That they have right now

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
They're going to be wanting to have tons of PS3

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And it's going to be hard to have

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Two systems being

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Manufactured at the same time

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
You know, I

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I just don't see it happening this soon

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I think they're just going to stick to their ten year plan

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Because they kind of do that with the move

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And I don't know if they've really tapped out yet

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
With what they can do on the PS3

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I hope not, I mean it's not

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I think that they can do a lot more

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And at the end of the day it's still

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
A cheap Blu-ray player for a lot of people

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
That, you know, are as Blu-ray

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Is getting into more and more homes as HDTVs

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Get in more and more homes

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I think, you know, Sony still has that advantage

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
That they're the only ones that's a Blu-ray player

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Still at the end of the day

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
So, you know, and I think that's been helping

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Move a lot more units than they might want to admit

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
That they would probably

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Chalk up to the quality of the games

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
And so forth, but I think the fact that it's a Blu-ray player

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Has been really moving it

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
So where the hell does the story come from?

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Is it just a bunch of bullshit?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Or could it maybe be that there's some type of

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
New PlayStation 3 redesign in the works

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I could see that before I would believe

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
That a PlayStation 4 is in the works

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Like yet another PlayStation 3 slim

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Maybe with

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Move more integrated into it or something

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I don't know if they would do that, but like

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Um

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I don't buy this yet

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I mean, cause there's, other than someone saying

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Oh, well this is what's gonna happen, we haven't seen any

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
You know, like with the FoxCon announcements

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Usually a lot of that will see, you know

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Pictures of the motherboards or something like that for these

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And um

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
You know, some sort of physical evidence for it

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Cause right now just one person's saying that that works

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Because you work at a

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I mean, you don't even know if you work there

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
You just say that you're a worker for one of these

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Places, doesn't necessarily

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I don't know, I don't know if I can trust that source

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I would just be willing to bet right now that

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
It's probably

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
You know, I think it's gonna be

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
A while still before we see the new console

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Unless, unless of course the Wii U really takes off

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And I think that they're gonna have to kinda

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Speed things along a bit, but I don't

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Honestly, with the Wii U, I mean

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I don't think it's gonna all of a sudden

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Just take over, I mean

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
The Wii is still the number one

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Selling console right now, but

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I don't think it's

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I don't think it is anymore, if you look at the monthly numbers

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I haven't been able to look at

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
The NPD reports have changed, so I haven't gotten to see

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
A lot of stuff, but

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
You know

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It's not like

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I think it's still cumulatively the top overall

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
But it's not the month to month

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Overall, it's the largest

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Selling system, but

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I just, I don't think

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
That this Wii U is gonna be

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I don't think they're gonna be able to pull

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Wii numbers again, because

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
It's kind of like, well, we've already seen

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
That, and yeah, the tablet thing is a little

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Bit new, but

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I don't know if it's gonna be enough to get people into

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I mean, look at the 3DS, perfect example

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
The 3D's new

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And I mean, granted, you know

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
If all things were correct

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
If they had a good launch lineup

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I think that things should have done really well

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But they just aren't utilizing

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
It enough, I mean

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
3D looks okay, but

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
It's just nothing, it's like

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I've kind of seen the tilt controls

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I've seen that before, you know

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
All the stuff I've seen this before, it's not new

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Alright

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
One more story for you guys, then we're gonna

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Travel around the world and look at release dates

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And what's coming out in a country near you

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
But first, releases, I'm sorry, first

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
A story from Dark Sakura, then releases

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I was about to say, what are you doing skipping my story

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Well

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
The

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
PSP had a digital comic service

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
And Sony said, nope, not anymore

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Cut

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Yes, it is going away

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:17.000
It has over 4,000 different comic book issues on it

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
But the digital comics

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Is going away

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
For the PSP at least

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
It may go to other Sony devices

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
But not to the PSP

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I think they're getting ready to transition

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
To Vita Land, Vita Land

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Well, what do you think about this, Dark Sakura

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
You're probably the biggest comic book fan here

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Out of the bunch, and you know, I know you

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Like the traditional comic books

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
How did you feel about comics on PSP?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I didn't care about them, really

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I've got comics on my iPhone

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I have Marvel, I use

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Marvel's digital service

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I have stacks of comic books

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
All over the house

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I have a drawer in my bedroom that's nothing but comics

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
We have a bin at Dan's Mother's

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
That's nothing but comics

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I have a drawer in my bedroom that's nothing but

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
PEZ dispensers

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I almost got you a PEZ dispenser

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I tried to find you a Cruella one, but they didn't have it

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Anyway

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
But it's like

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I really think that it's a transitional thing

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I think that they're starting to phase out

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
The maybe lesser used items

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
That are directly related to PSP

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And start getting things ready for the new system

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
That's how I see it

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And honestly, I really don't care

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Because you have to be really careful

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
When doing comics for a small screen format

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
And sometimes you lose something

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Maybe at the end of the day

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
They just weren't selling

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Did you ever buy a comic book on the PSP?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
No

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I'm just trying to see what else they had

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
They had Batman Beyond

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
And Ender's Game

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And Suicide Girls

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Maybe IOS was just doing it better

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And so people that did want to do digital distribution

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Went there

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Who knows

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
It could be

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
And honestly, I had a few different comic book readers on my iPhone

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
But the ones that I always thought were the best well done

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Were the ones that were

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Standalone releases

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Through

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
The app store

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
For example

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I tried a service and downloaded a few free comics

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
To see what it was like

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And you kind of have to

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Scroll funny through the system

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Whereas when I got the Star Trek movie prequel ones

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Oh, Countdown

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
That's what it was called

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Those were well done because they were actually

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Resized for the screen by panel

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And done where you could see the action clearly

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I'm going to our chatroom

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
There's actually a little bit of love going on

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
For Marvel's digital service

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
DDR Dollar Bill says

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I like Marvel's digital service

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Game Guru says

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I started using Marvel's digital service myself

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Robert M. in our chatroom says

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Will the PSP app still be available for back issues?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
That's a good question

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
I don't see why they would close the app

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And I would imagine their agreements with the publishers

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Allow it so that if you have purchased a comic

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
You get to keep it

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
There's no reason for them to take it down

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
They said nothing about taking it down

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
They just are going to stop supporting it

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Right, it'll be like Microsoft Game Room

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
If you really want to go into Game Room

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And download a lot of the old games you can

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
But a new game hasn't come out in about a year now

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Yeah, but they're not going to deny people

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Who have already used the service

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
That would just be really crappy

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Exactly, that's exactly it

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
And for the record, Marvel's digital comic service

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Is really nice

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Very easy to use

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I'll go on Avengers West Coast

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Very quickly with that

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
One of these days I'll get me an iPad

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And I'll check that out

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
But we'll see

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I'm a ways off from that

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Alright, let's go travel the world and look at some release dates

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
What is coming to a gaming store near you

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Logie, start us off with the US

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Not a whole lot this week

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Starting off with NCAA football

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
For Xbox 360 and Playstation 3

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Gods and Heroes

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Rome Rising collector's edition

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Out this week on PC

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Let's see

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
The Elder Scrolls Oblivion 5th anniversary edition

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
With a nice little map in there

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
And some DLC

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Plus $10 towards Skyrim

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And that's only 30 bucks

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
And the Wii

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Part 2 on Playstation 3

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Xbox 360, Wii, DS

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
And PC

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
UFC Personal Trainer

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
On the Wii

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
And let's see here

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And that's actually it

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
It's our week

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Alright, let's look at Japan

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And what's coming out over there

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
On the

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I think it would be the 14th

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
It would be the release date

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
There is actually nothing on the Xbox 360

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Of note

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
So turning around here to look at the Playstation 3

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Releases

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Playstation 3 has a couple releases

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Japan Midnight gets a price reduction

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
On July 14th

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
It moves into the Playstation 3 best

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
As does White Knight Chronicles 2

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Moves into the best series

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And I believe the American

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Or the Europe release of that is not too far away

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I've been reading some early reviews on it

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
That have not been too kind

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Also on the Playstation 3 this week in Japan

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Brink and Tenchou no Igo

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
As well as Jikkyou

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2011

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Comes out this week

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
This is a baseball game

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
From Konami

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
With chibi little characters

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Not a series I believe we have over here

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Looking at some of the other systems

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Trying to see if there's actually anything on the Wii at all

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I don't think so

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
But we do have the PSP

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
We have

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Taiko no Tatujin Portable DX

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Comes out

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Music game fans may recognize that as the

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Taiko drumming game

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Looks like there's a new version of that

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
This week in Japan

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Unchained Blades Rex comes out this week

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
And Ys

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Gets price reductions all over the place

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
As they move into the best series

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Ys 1 and 2, Ys 7

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And Ys vs. Sora no Kiseuke

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Alternative Saga

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
All those are getting price reductions this week

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
So if you're an Ys fan that's late to the party

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
In Japan

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Good news, you get to get in cheap now

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Ys 3 is the best

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
One game of note on the Wii

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
16th from level 5

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Inazuma Eleven Strikers

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
It's a sports game

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Coming out from level 5

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It's a soccer game

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Looks like it incorporates characters from

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Various other games and anime

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
So it looks like kind of like a

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Fan wank soccer game

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Good times

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Alright, let's move on

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
With the UK dates

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
We have a few

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Going ahead and pulling up that list

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
On the 11th we have

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Air Conflict Secret Wars

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
And the 13th we have Boulder Dash XL

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And Ms. Splosion Man

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
On the 15th we have

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Captain America Super Soldier

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Coming out on damn near everything

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And also on just about everything

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
But maybe not as many things as Captain America

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Done

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Nice

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Told ya

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Alright, let's do a couple more gaming news

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Stories and then the classic game of the week

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
We will take a stroll down memory lane

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And remember a classic game

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
In just a moment

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
People weren't really happy with the Resident Evil

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Mercenaries 3D save controversy

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
The fact that, you know, Capcom was not allowing

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
People to erase their saves

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Guess

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Their particular save system

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
You know, they didn't allow people to reset

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Because they're claiming it's more like an arcade game

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
You know, where you can't reset scores on an arcade machine

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
You know, this isn't the first time

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Now that I think of it that Capcom has

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Fucked up a save system

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
You may remember Dead Rising 1

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
They had real issues with that

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
It's like, do you guys not know how to program

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
You know, save games correctly

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Is that really a problem for you?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
But they're saying though

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
That their intent was

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Never quite malicious

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
You know, despite the

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Conspiracy theories out there

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
That would have you believe

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And that they said that the

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Reset saves was a conscious design decision

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Aimed at maintaining the arcade fighter

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Feeling of the title

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
That's so much bullshit

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
It's just ridiculous

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
You know, although they did release

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
This statement

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
And now I'm wondering, I don't know if it's bullshit

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
So much as it just was a dumb decision

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Like, I

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Wonder if somebody didn't really say

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
We don't need to program in the save

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Delete thing, it's like an arcade

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Skip that part, like just a dumb decision

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
There is a device out there though

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
That will actually erase those save games

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
That I saw out there

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Cause there was an article I saw where you can

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
They're recommending, well one of the two ways

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
You can delete your save games, one through the game to a campfire

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Two, use this device

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
And the device apparently allows you to back up

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Game saves on 3DS and DS

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
And also allows you to erase them

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
So

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
They could easily just fix this with a patch

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
You know, 3DS games are

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
You can patch those

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
You can patch Capcom, you can patch them

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
You do this shit on consoles

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I mean, why don't you just say

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Hey, you know what, we fucked up

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
You guys want, you know, your save reset stuff

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I'll tell you what, we're gonna go ahead and patch it in

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
So you can reset your saves

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
But no, they're being dicks, so

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Fine, that's fine

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I wasn't gonna buy this game anyways

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And even less reason to do so now

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Yeah, it's kinda one of those games that

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I probably wouldn't have bought anyway

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
But I especially am not gonna buy it now

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Let's move on to a story that's

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Actually, I think this is kinda one of those

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Pretty awesome stories I wanna talk about here

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And this has to do with Dr. Stephen Hicks

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Who is a clinical neurologist at the University of Oxford

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
He is working on

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Some glasses

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
That has technology that's inspired

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
By Xbox 360 connect games

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
iPads

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
And what these glasses are, they're to help

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Blind folks see shapes and people better

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And it uses the technology

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Of the Kinect and the iPads

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
It's mostly for folks that

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Like, they can detect light

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
But they can't fully see

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
The glasses would use these cameras

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
That would be on corners of the lenses

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
To detect the information

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And then it would send it to a little computer

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
You know, because everything's so tiny these days

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I guess it's all in the glasses

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
The computer will then translate the information

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
And transmit it to LEDs

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Inside the lenses of the glasses

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And those LEDs would light up

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
In patterns that you would be trained

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
To understand

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
The visor

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I know, right? And even some blogs

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Around the internet put this picture of

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
LeVar Burton

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
From the next generation

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
With the freaking headband visor

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
But you know, I think that's

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
That's amazing that video game technology

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
That's one of those good stories

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
You'll never hear on

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
CNN and so forth

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
A doctor was inspired by what he saw with the Kinect

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
And what he saw with the iPads

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
He said, hey, if the Kinect sends out

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
These lasers all around the room

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
To detect what's in the room

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Why couldn't you like

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Scrunch the Kinect down into a pair of glasses

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
And have the glasses emit the lasers

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Around the room and then kind of translate that

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Into what, you know, somebody who

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Maybe isn't like totally blind

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
But can see at least light

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Maybe help kind of translate

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
That into something

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Also, the story goes on saying

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
There could be an earpiece

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
That could possibly give detailed spoken information

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Like what time a bus leaves

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Could you imagine that?

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Imagine this

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
On the front of the bus

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And I'm totally making this up

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
It puts this image in my head

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
The front of the bus has one of those

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
QR type of codes

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
And so a person wearing these glasses

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
The laser could scan that QR code

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
From a distance and tell that person in their ear

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
This is the bus that goes to market

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Or whatever

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
That's amazing

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
That's actually a really good idea

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Copyright it real quick

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Patent pending

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But you know what I mean

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I gotta hand it to this guy

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I mean, thinking to put the Kinect in glasses

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Is a pretty good idea

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I'm just saying, you know, we have this very

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Scan society where we scan codes

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
And now it's in the iPhone application

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Why can't the visor scan those codes?

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
That'd be amazing

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Kaijuto says

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Name them Kinect specs

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I know we have some blind gamers

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
That listen to this show

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
So I would really love to hear like what you think

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
About this

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Like if this is

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
If you think this is gonna be amazing

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Or if maybe you have

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Trouble conceptualizing this

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Cause you know, I read this

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And I go, it's gonna help the blind see

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
And I go, oh that's a great thing

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
But you know, I'm not actually blind

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
So I would like to hear from somebody

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
To let me know if like this is actually gonna be a great

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Thing

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
You know they're actually also working on

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Retinal patches

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
That are supposed to rework

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
The way the optic nerve

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Takes in the information

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
For cases of people with nerve damage

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
And it's actually very similar in theory

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Because these are actually

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Relaying

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
It's like they've got these implants that relay information

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Directly into the optic nerve

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
So that people can quote see

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
But it's a lot of the same theory too

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Instead it's just a matter of

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Instead of directing

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Going directly into the nerve, it's a matter of

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Providing a projection

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
A display that can be

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Recognizable to people

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
With that level of vision

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
So yeah, that makes sense

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Kaijuto in the chat room says 800 Microsoft points

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
If you want to keep seeing past three months

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
That's wrong, that's just wrong

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
They do say that the goal is to bring

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
In the glasses at under a thousand

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Pounds each, because remember this is being

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Researched at Oxford University

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
But still, I mean, you know

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
That sounds really expensive, but

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
For a piece of technology

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
That you would use

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Everywhere every day

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
That actually does not seem so bad at all

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And pretty affordable

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
That's pretty awesome

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Misty in our chat room at chat.onorsonshadeo.com says

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Hey, pew pewing QR codes is fun

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
You know, there is

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Something about those QR codes

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Like, they're all ads for something

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
But yet, she's right

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
There's something about scanning those codes

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
It's kind of fun

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
But I'm just saying, why not

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Really give those codes a real practical

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Purpose that could actually better society

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Rather than just giving URLs to websites

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
And things like that

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Actually, put them up for events

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Yeah

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
With a lot of the stuff that we do now

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
On school for advertising

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
We actually include the QR codes for the charity events

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
For, like, student council

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Stuff

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
So they use them a lot in terms of

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Passing along event information

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And I actually find them a lot of times

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Oddly enough, on Japanese blogs

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Interesting

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
They've been having to scan the code

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Things for forever

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Mobile phones have always been more advanced

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Over there. It isn't until we got the iPhone

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
When finally

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
They started looking at our phones

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Going, hmm, we like that

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
But for the longest time, they were far more fast

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Remember the after years? Final Fantasy 4, the after years

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And the Wii? That was originally a mobile phone game in Japan

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Well, and keep in mind too

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Is that cellular networks are cheaper

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Than landlines

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Overseas

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
So it ended up becoming a much

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Better market to develop

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
As opposed to people here

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I still like my rotary phone!

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I like the noises

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I do like my rotary phone

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
But it's not as good

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
As having to actually call the operator

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And ask to be put through

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
To, you know, Mrs. Cleaver

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Although, you know, if people go to Geek Life

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
And click the link

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
For ThinkGeek

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
You can buy

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
A handset for your iPhone

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
A rotary phone style

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Handset for your iPhone

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
You can also buy bacon mince on ThinkGeek

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Yes you can

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Anyhow

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
But follow the link

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Anyway, but back to

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Are we gonna get a kick back

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
For that little plug you just sent?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Maybe

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
But back to the point

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I mean

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
It really has to do also with how far

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Society itself is willing to advance

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Keep in mind

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I'm gonna use an old comparison here

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Betamax and VHS

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
If you look at the two side by side

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Betamax was the better format

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
You had a better picture quality

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
But it went

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
To VHS because of funding

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Because that's what got the push

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
You know, it's that way with any

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Technology, it depends on what's

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Got the backing behind it

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Where you're, say that you live in Japan

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
And it's better to have a cell phone service

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
You know

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Then, obviously

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
That's where the money is, that's where people are gonna push the technology

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
But here, for the longest time

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
It was all landlines

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Cell phones were novel, you had that big brick

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
In your car, you know

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
But now it's kind of turning around

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Like, you know, Dan and I don't have a landline

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
God, I remember my parents' first cell phone

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Like that fucker mounted in the

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Middle of the car

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And it was this giant handset

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
It looked like it was connected to a car battery

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
It looked like it caused cancer

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
No, we went to a trip

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Coming back from

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Washington one time when Dan's dad

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Had his wedding

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Soon after I moved out here

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
So we're talking about, you know

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Late 90s

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And it looked like a phone attached to a car battery

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
You know what I mean?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Yeah, it really did

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Okay, who's seen Kill Bill?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And the phone that Sophie pops out

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
In the flashback scene

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
You know, that's what cell phones look like

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Yeah, yeah

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
So

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
But my point is that it

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Really depends on

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
The market the money is gonna be in

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
So

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
God, I met a kid the other day

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Didn't know what a VHS tape was

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I'm gonna smack him upside the head

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I don't know what a VHS tape is

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Well, because by the time

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
This guy would have been 5 or 6

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
DVDs were out

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
So what? I didn't, you know

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I know what a fucking 8-track tape is

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And I didn't fucking see those forever

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
I think part of it was just trolling

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
It made me think like

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Oh god, you are old enough

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Or maybe you only ever know what it is

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I don't know what paper is

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Paper and pen, I've got a Kindle

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Actually, you know, it's funny

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Going back to Japan

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
They had a phenomenon going on for a while

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Where people were actually forgetting how to hand write

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Certain kanji

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Because they were so used to

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Well basically, on my iPhone

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Whenever I put in anything

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Using the Japanese typewriter

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I get a lot of words

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
That are spelled the same way

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Actually, I could totally see that happening here

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Like, I don't think that's just limited

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
To the complex written language

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Of some of the Asian languages

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Like, I

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I would think even I am challenged

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
To sit down, like imagine if I had to sit down

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
And write a letter in cursive

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Like, that would actually take a minute to kind of like

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Like, some of the capital letters

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
You don't write every day

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Actually? I take a lot of written notes

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
But I print, you know

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
But like, if I had to write cursive

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Like, I don't really practice that

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I actually do practice my cursive

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Do you? You're a nerd

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
My mother used to

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
My mother used to sit me down

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
My mom has gorgeous

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Handwriting

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
I always got F's in handwriting

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Your son has Parkinson's

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
She would make me sit down and practice my handwriting

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
So to this day

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
And then when I went and took typography

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I had to

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Basically what he had us do is start off with glyphs

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And then find out once our glyphs got to be a little bit more

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
You know, just free

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Free drawing little glyphs

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
And once they got to be more complex

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Then we said, okay, what letter does that look like

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
And we'd practice full letter forms

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And then pick that and go from there

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So it was, it was talking about, you know

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
How written language evolved

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Just, you know, from

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Reflex in your hands

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
My printed handwriting

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Got better when I started my job as a corporate trainer

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Because I have to write on the whiteboard

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
All the time

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
And it's actually kind of embarrassing that my handwriting sucks

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Like, and I know, like, I'll be writing stuff on the board

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
And I'm like, oh god, it looks like a seven year old

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Is teaching this class. Practice

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
But, yeah, well, you know

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Well, and I've been doing my job long enough now where it's gotten a lot better

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
But, I mean, that's the whole point

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Is that those handwriting

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Skills aren't being focused on that much anymore

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
So people are forgetting

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
What should be a basic skill

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I mean, a lot of people are actually even forgetting

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
The origins of their language

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Like, I posted something from Crag today about

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Words showing up in the dictionary, like, girl

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Like, the G-R-R-R-L

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
And stuff, and

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
I'm like, those aren't real words

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Those don't need to be there. That's slang

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
The one reason I would want to be an English teacher

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Is to say, if you use any text speak in a written paper

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
You automatically fail this entire class

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Well, and

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
My teacher, my second grade teacher

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Was mean

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Okay, she was pregnant

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
And then had her baby, so I think part of it might have been

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Now that I'm an adult, it might have been postpartum

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Right

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
But the first half of the semester we had the sweetest lady as the substitute

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
And then the rest of the year

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Ms. Bitch came

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Her name was Ms. Bitch

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I'm not gonna say it, I still remember her name

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
But anyway, she used to just walk by

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
And smack our hands every time we started

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Doing a letter form wrong

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
It's like, no, you're gonna sit and you're gonna start from the beginning

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
And rewrite the whole thing

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
But I think people

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Are relying too much on their cell phones also

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
To correct their spelling

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
How many more

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
How much more often do you see people doing

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
T-H-E-R-E

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
When they mean a possessive there

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Oh, right

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I think people are relying too much on

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Their autocorrect

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
It goes back to that same thing when I brought up Japan

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
With people forgetting how to write

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
You know, even

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
I was even reading an article the other day about how

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
A lot of the original

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Kanji is actually now brought out in more simplified forms

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
And people are forgetting how to write the old way

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
But it's

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I think that

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Having our computers

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
And everything do this for us

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Is making us all lazier as people

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
People are forgetting something that should just be

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Something that you learn in first grade

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Alright, OLR listeners

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Now if you think maybe your handwriting could use some improvement

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Here's a chance

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
To find a pen and paper

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Which might be a chore all in itself

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
But find a pen and paper

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
And write down

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Five times every day

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Dark Soccer, you're a design person

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Why is that sentence important?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Because it has every letter in the alphabet

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Good job

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
That's also why it's used for typeface samples

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
But there's a few other sentences

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
That have everyone

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Emma Gray

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Which is one of the type foundries that I follow

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Has different sample sheets out

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
That whole like lorem ipsum

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
No, not the lorem ipsum, different sentences

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
That have the same letters in them

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
See, I'm trying to

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Integrate the geeky design stuff into the show for you

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Thank you, it makes me happy

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Throwing you a bone

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I had a squee, which is why I was showing you someone

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Throwing up rainbows on somebody else

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I'll find the picture for the chatroom

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Alright, well speaking of throwing up rainbows

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Here's some happy music for you

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
They can always tell you that the classic game of the week is on its way

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Every week Dark Soccer goes to the gaming vault

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
And finds a game that she thinks you ungrateful children should be checking out

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Especially if you've never had VHS in your life

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Then you probably have missed a lot of these games

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I had a Betamax player

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
I had a Betamax player too, sit down

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
I had Clue on Betamax, sit down

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I had an 8-track player

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
With a record player attached to it

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
And transistor tubes

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Hold up to the classic game of the week

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I had the record player

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
That was built into the, well my family had the record player

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
That was built into the shelf

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Because the shelf was the speaker, it was so big

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
And we had Star Wars soundtrack on vinyl

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And I wish I still had that today

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Because that thing's probably worth a shit ton of money

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
You know what else I had on vinyl?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Close Encounters of the Third Kind

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
So I could listen to the, the track was called The Conversation

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And I always knew which one it was

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Based on how far apart the grooves were

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
But not only that, I had a record player

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
That lit up in different colors

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
When it was turned on

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
And you would play the Sesame Street records on them

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
That would read the book to you

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And then when you hear the noise

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Turn the page, bing!

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Oh yeah?

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I had a grandma phone, I had to fucking crank that shit

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
If I wanted something to play

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
My husband's laughing in the other room

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
But actually I'll tell you one thing

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
That I did have

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I had an entire set of Voltron

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Books on cassette

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Black Wolf in Chat says I had reel to reel

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Beotches. Dude, when I studied

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Communication Design in college, we had to

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Learn, like this is just

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
This is honestly

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Should I say this on the radio?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Say it!

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I have learned more from doing Orange Lounge Radio in the past

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Nine years than I learned in college

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Paying thousands of dollars

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
To attend this communication design program

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And that's one of the reasons why I don't think

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Me dropping out of college was such a bad idea

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
And why I think it's bullshit

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
And employers require BA degrees

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And all this stuff

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I know it's a controversial opinion to have

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
But I don't think school's for everyone

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
It's honestly true because I've seen more people

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I've seen people with more talent in their little finger

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Than people who've

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Got masters in design

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Yet they

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Because in college

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
In college we had to learn

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
How to record to the reel to reel

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
And we had to learn how to edit

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
The reel to reel

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
With fucking tape and a wax pen

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Where you listen to the thing and then you have to do

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
The wax pen to cut out the words

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
And all this stuff and guess how much

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I've used a wax tape

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
In producing nine years

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
That last longer than most radio shows

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Do on commercial radio

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Guess how many times I've used a wax pen

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
In the nine years of doing this show

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Zero

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Because the state school

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Is not on the cutting edge of technology

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
But you could get drinks really cheap

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I can say this though

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
The design program at Sac State

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Is actually really top notch and some of the people are hiring

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Directly from Sac State now

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Well I'm sure things have changed and so forth

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
But I'm just saying

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Some people learn best from just being thrown in the pool

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
And told you better fucking swim to me

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Well there's a book I'm reading right now

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Which by the way the review should be on Geek Life

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
In a few days

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And I know it's ironic that I'm a teacher now

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
But there's a big difference

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Well but the book I'm reading

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Is an autobiography

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Of a big name in comics

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
And again everyone will find out who it is

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
But it's talking about how he broke into illustration

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
And comics just by

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Drawing all the time and then being hired

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Because of his talent because of his skill

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
And learning how to do

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Newspaper editing

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
And you know

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Airbrushing you know in the 30's

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
By being said

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Coach these are your inks

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
So anyway

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I realize my opinion is a little bit controversial

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
But I just speak from real life experience

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I agree with you

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I realize some of the people out there may not

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
And may even possibly be offended but I'm just saying

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
From my experience in my world

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
College did nothing for me

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
But fucked me up emotionally

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Well like with the classes I've gone to

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
I know how to use the programs already

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
But I listen to my teachers

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Who have been working in the field

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I want their experience

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
It's a better thing when you have a teacher that gives you real life experience

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Because they're in it

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
They're doing it

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
As opposed to oh I got my masters and now I'm gonna teach

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
You know what I mean

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
You can tell the difference

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
But yeah I'm sorry

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Anyhow

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Oh you know what else I had?

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I had all of the Gremlins records that they gave out at McDonald's

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
With the Happy Meal

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I had the record that came free in the newspaper

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
That sang the song about the

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Mac McDLT a quarter pounder with some cheese

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Layover hamburger and cheese

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
How do I remember that song? I remember that fucking song

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I had the Fruit Loops one

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Rob I had the Fruit Loops one

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
The one that came in on a square album

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
In a box of Fruit Loops

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
It's like a fucking plastic record

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I know

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I love how we went from throwing up rainbows

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
You know

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
You know you're old school when you've had

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
A warped record and you fixed it yourself

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
You know you're old school when you know

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
That the best version of Alice in Wonderland

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
They ever made was that TV movie in the 80's

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
With Carol Channing

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
I know

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Back to rainbows

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
How about some classic games

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Well this

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I'm taking us all the way back

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
To 1996

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
That was before I moved out here

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
And I must thank my husband

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
For turning me on to this series even though

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I did work for Namco for a little while

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
But I didn't really give it much thought until

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
My husband said

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
This game's awesome we're gonna play it

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
And it is Soul Edge

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Woo

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Soul Edge

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
You got soul

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
So

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
This is the intro so we have to play a little bit of the intro

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Transcending history and the world

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
A tale of soul

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And swords

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Eternally told

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Anyway

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
This game had

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
We've actually got this soundtrack

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
It's really cool but anyway

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
This is from the Playstation version

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Soul Blade

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Soul Edge is

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
A 3D fighting game

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
It was the second one that had characters with weapons

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
The first being Toushinden

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
And this

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Actually had

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Everyone had their different style

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Depending on their actual weapon

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:35.000
This came out in arcades in 1996

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
And then there was

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
A different version that's called

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Soul Edge version 2

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
That

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Was basically a little bit easier because people found

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
The original to be

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Really hard and that you couldn't beat the last boss

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Hwang

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Was put into

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
That version as well

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
He was actually originally a palette swap

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Of Mitsurugi in the Korean version

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
And you could play as Cervantes

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Who was the pirate

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Who had the Soul Edge

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
The sword

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
They also put in air combos

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
And guard impacts

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
And everyone had upgraded moves

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
It came out like I said on the Playstation

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
As Soul Blade

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
And uh

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
It was

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
That's Cervantes music

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
I love that song it's so cool

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
But anyway everyone had their own little

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Hold on let me let the listeners have a

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Peek at this music real quick cause

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I will say one thing I love

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
One thing I love about these games is the

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Soundtracks I mean they're just

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Amazing here we go little clip

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
But yes oh that's actually

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
I think my favorite piece in that game

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
That's the arranged version by the way from the

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Playstation version

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Cause the Playstation versions had arranged

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Soundtracks as well as the original

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Soundtracks so it was really cool

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Nice

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
At any rate

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
It basically you could move

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Your character all along

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Their little

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Stage area

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And you had borders around the stage

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
If you fell off of your little stage

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Then that was you know you'd die

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
It's kind of hard though to jump off the stage

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Your jump was

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Actually kind of

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Not really so much of a jump

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
But some characters had better jumps

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
There was also

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
A weapon gauge

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
And it had your weapons resistance on it

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
And

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
When you would block an attack your bar would

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Deplete and if it emptied you would lose

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Your weapon

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
And then you'd have to finish the match unarmed

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
So basically like

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Oops my sword broke oh crap

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
And

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
There were also

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Locking moves too so you'd have to

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Press the button you know at the right time

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
And see who could get out of it

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Everyone had

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
One or two unblockable attacks

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Which actually came from the Tekken series

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
And

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
It was really hard to pull them off

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
So that kept it pretty balanced and then

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
You had critical edge attacks

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
That were long

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Like a long series of different links

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Kind of like have you ever played in Tekken

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
When you used King's throws it was kind of the same deal

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
But then

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
There were

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Different combinations of

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Different attacks that would you know have

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
A special sequence

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
So on top of that it would also

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Deplete a third of the weapons gauge

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
When you used it it was the ABK attacks

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
It had

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Aggressive block which was called guard impact

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
That would

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Give you a free counter attack

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
And then you also had like I said earlier

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
A ring out

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
You can't just jump out of the ring you have to be thrown out of the ring

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
The game

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Itself according to

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Namco

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Took place in 1584

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And it's warriors searching

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
For the soul edge

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
It had different names but it was pretty

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Nasty

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Anytime someone had it bad crap happened

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
So it had all kinds of

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Different characters you had Siegfried

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
You have Mizurugi

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
You had Tamara

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
You had Taki who was your ninja girl

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Voldo oh Voldo

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
He was Mr. Bondage boy

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
His weapon was a

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
K-tar

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
The hand mounted blade

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
And he wore lots of

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Strappy leather

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
I'm sure some of us recall

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And then there was

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Like

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Sungmina

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
And then there was a character added

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Who was in Soul Blade

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
As a secret character

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
It came out on

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Playstation on December 20th

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
1996 in Japan and it came out

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
In 97 in the USA and Europe

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
And it kept all

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
The soul edge version 2

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
And 5 unlockable characters

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Including the soul edge

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
The boss of the game

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Had arcade mode versus mode, survival, team battle

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Time attack and training

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Had an RPG mode called

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Edge master mode

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
So you could basically

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Go through a story had it like they were

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
A character in a book so it was kind of neat

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
And you had

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Extra versions of different weapons

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
That had more power, more strength

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
More durability and like I said

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Also you had an arranged soundtrack

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And the arcade soundtrack

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
And then you had the

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Khan super session

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Which that's the album that we have

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Is the Khan super session that

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
This band, their stuff

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Is really really good stuff

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
So it is

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Probably one of the best

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Fighting games ever

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I think

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
I think a lot of people have a lot of love for this game

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I gotta admittedly I didn't get into this series

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Until Soul Calibur 2

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
The arcade version

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Which still is like one of my favorite

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Gamecube games they ever made

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
That's actually from I just noticed this intro

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
That we're listening to the music off of

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
The Japanese intro

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Because they had to put clothes on

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Sofotia

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
And the scene where she's in the water

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
And Hephaestus is coming out of the water to talk to her

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
She's naked in the Japanese version

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
They had to put clothes on her in the American one

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Which is

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Redonkulous

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
And she's got her hands over her boobs so what's the big deal

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Alright

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Anyhow there it is your classic game of the week

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Soul Blade or Soul Edge

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Whatever you want to refer to it as

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Alright

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
That's gonna do it for part A of our show

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
But don't go anywhere we've got plenty more to come

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Looks like it's gonna be a long show tonight

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Including some rapid fire news when we get back

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Twitter topics! Get your tweets in

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Twitter.com slash OLR

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
You got about 5 more minutes to get those in if you're listening live

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
On Sunday nights

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
And some more news stories and of course your calls

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Don't go anywhere, we'll be back after this

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
We are live here

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
On this July 10th

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
2011 with episode

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Number 419 of our show

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Which you know means next week is episode

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
420

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Not that any of us are gonna

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Do anything outside of the norm for that

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Week but I just thought it was worth saying

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
That some of our listeners will be

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
But anyhow, just throwing that out there

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Usually at this part of the show

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
We want to plug a couple of the

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Side projects and other things that we're working on

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I do want to go ahead and work in

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
One other plug quickly for the

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Understation Live 10th anniversary show

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
That is going to be this coming Saturday

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
I know I'm going to be there and

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Jessica Harper will be there

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
And we're going to be reminiscing about the good old days

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
At Understation Live

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
The show where I started

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
On internet radio

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Although I guess you could say

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I did internet radio in college but

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
You know, again, wax tapes

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
So it really started

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
On Understation Live

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Back in 2001

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Also, Hoard House is the show I do

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
About the world of Warcraft with my buddy

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Xtopher, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
If you are a Warcraft fan you really should check it out

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
www.hoardhouse.com

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I got really angry on this week's show

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
And it has to do with getting booted from a pug

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
And it occurred to me

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
I don't know if you saw my reply to a post

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
On our private guild's forums

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
But that night I was so mad

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I think you said something to me

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
DarkSakura, and I was like, this game can suck

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
My fucking dick, good night

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
It didn't occur to me until like two days later

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
I was like, oh god, did she think I said that to her?

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Because I wasn't saying that to her

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
You said some acronym

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
That I didn't understand at the time

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Oh

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
And then afterwards I was like

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Oh, that's what it is

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Because you said VTK'd

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
And I was like

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Oh, vote kicked, yes

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
They VTK'd me

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
But I was like

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
My reply I remember was

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
What? And they were like, this game can suck my dick

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I'm going bye

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
And I'm sitting there just staring at my computer

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Going

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Who's gonna play with me now?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I had a diva moment

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Where I stormed off the set

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Seriously, that's exactly what it was like

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
And I'm like, seriously, I sat there for ten minutes

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
I had time for my character to go

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
On away, and sit down, and pout

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Aww

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
But I mean, I was like, I was trying to figure out what's going on

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
So I started looking it up online

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
I was emotionally raped by a guild

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
On another server with that vote kick

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Do the troll dungeons link to other servers?

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Oh yeah, they all do

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I didn't know about that

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Oh yeah, they all do

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
So be careful

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Oh no, I was just gonna say

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Speaking of voting the kick

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Prior to the mods being patched on Grand Theft Auto

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
When we were playing just regular

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Private matches

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
My co-workers usually tried to vote to kick me out of the game

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Because I'd be kicking the crap out of them

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I was like, vote him out

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
He's beaten

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
That's ignorant that somebody would vote kick

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Just because they're good

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
They think it's funny

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
That's what I keep telling myself

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
That I couldn't just handle my beauty

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
So that's why they had to vote kick me

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
More information on that at Hoardhouse.com

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
We told you about the stupid bitch we had

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
In one of your groups?

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Oh yeah, something like

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
They didn't want to heal the tank

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
We'll tell the story really quickly

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
We were at Grim Butthole

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Sorry, Grim Butthole

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
But it's Grim Butthole

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Because it sucks

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
We kind of wanted to skip the harder battles in there

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Because they're a pain in the ass

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
And it's like

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I just want to run through this really fast

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I don't care about anybody else

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
And then she starts getting really foul

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
And then she's like

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Let's vote to kick the tank

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
And I'm like, bitch no

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
I was like, do you read that all of us

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Are in the same guild and you're not?

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
See, you should have vote kicked her

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I started, I did

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I requested a vote kicker three times

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
And it didn't pass?

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
It did on the third time

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Because it did that delay

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
I was not a rude cunt

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
So there's a big difference

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
But she was, she was

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
I've got screen capture, she was that bad

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
And, okay

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I'm going to tell you something everybody

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
And it doesn't matter if you're on World of Warcraft

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Or whatever MMO that you're on

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Be nice

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
You don't get anything from being a bitch

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Or, you know

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Blaming everything on the tank

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Or a troll

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
There's so many trolls in WoW

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
And it's really like

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
What do you really get

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
This is masturbation for you

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I can't think of anything else that

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Trolling accomplishes other than

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Jacking yourself off

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I'm going to give a few pieces of advice

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Now this is a little more specific

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
To WoW

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I will repeat these later on for you

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
In a recorded version if you like

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Rule number one

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Don't be a dick

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Rule number one of the OL army

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Which I know we don't talk about that a lot

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
But you know we do have a steam group

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
We do have several gaming groups available online

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
You know with all the steam sale orgy stuff

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Going on right now, if you're not in the OLR group

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I don't know what you're doing

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Cause the rule number one of the OL army

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Is don't be a dick

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And so you know you should come join us on steam

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
And more information is at OrangeLunchRadio.com

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
In that little extend play box on the left side

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Well number two refers to how you treat your tank

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
It's a three strike rule

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Number one

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
If your tank doesn't flat out say

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I've never tanked this before

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
And they're doing a bad job, stop and explain the mechanic

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
To them if you happen to know it

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
If they still act shitty

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Give them one more try and if they are just

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Derpy say sorry

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
We need you to leave

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
That really doesn't just apply to tanks

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I think that can go for anybody

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
In any MMO, it doesn't even have to be WoW

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
And sometimes people make mistakes like

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I started using, you know when you hit V and the little life bar show up

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
I accidentally targeted

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
A creature in a group over

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Because the little name tag

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Was like right next to the one I was targeting

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
And so I made a boo boo

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
But I you know went and reshaped everybody

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
And everyone was happy

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
But it's just like

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Don't point fingers

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Don't lay blame

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
If someone is truly bad

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
A good party will hold them through it

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
If they are being bad on purpose

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Then say sorry you need to practice this one

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
A little bit more, play with your guildies for a bit

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Because I played with

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
I will not be in a party unless there is one other guildie with me

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I just won't do it

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
I did it once though on my first troll heroic

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
But anyway

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
My third rule

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
If you are not on your game

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
You need to step back

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Don't blame somebody else

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
For what you are doing wrong

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Like for example I will use me from the other day

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
I was getting motion sick after

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
While you were playing with us

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
And we were an all guild group

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And when we got people from outside

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
The guild after you had to log off

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Because you weren't feeling well

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
I had to stop playing because I couldn't take breaks

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Because I was getting motion sick

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Or if I'm having a bad night

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
I'll say you know what I'm just not into this

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I'm going to have to back out because I'm holding everyone back

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
You need to be able to say

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
To take enough responsibility on yourself

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
That you're not going to ruin somebody else's good time

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
So those are

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
My three rules for playing with other people

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Words of sage wisdom

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
From an OMG real life girl

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Yes

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Speaking of MMOs

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I can't remember if I told this story last week

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
So stop me if I'm repeating myself

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I'm getting old and I forget an old age

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Salacious Pop did a really big troll on me

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Because of the Steam sale that's going on

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I was mentioning just off hand something about

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
I wonder what Final Fantasy 11

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Is like these days

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
You know gosh I'd be really curious

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
What's going on in 11 these days

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Steam you have been gifted

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
A copy of Final Fantasy 11

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
The complete Uber edition

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Including the new Abyssia expansion

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
It's 11 bucks

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
I know I look over at Alan

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
And I go like you're such a fucking troll

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
So

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
That is actually downloading at home right now

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Not that I'm going to log in and play right away

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
But yeah

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I do have 30 days of that that I can check out at some point

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Oh mine finally finished I downloaded

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Champions

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Oh you downloaded Champions the free

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
You know what

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
If someone gave me $11

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
So I could get Final Fantasy 11 Rob I would play with you

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Just to see

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
How lolsy it is now

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
But somebody has to give you

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
$11 good luck on that

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Or just send it to me on Steam

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
It's so easy now

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Alright

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Dan's in the other room saying no more momos

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
No more momos but it's only 30

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Days Dan

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
That's

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
He's yelling

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
That's how Warcraft started

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
And then he goes fucking Rob

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Yeah I know I know

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Alright let's move on

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
We need to do some rapid fire news

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
And talk about some other stuff going on

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Instagaming world

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Loki

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Speaking of Final Fantasy

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
There's a Final Fantasy game coming to the 3DS

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Although this may not be the Final Fantasy game you're looking for

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
It's Final Fantasy

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Um

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Why did I have to make these like really ridiculous

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Fake names

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
The rhythm I guess

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
The rhythm

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
It's like theater rhythm mixed together

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Anyways

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
It is a rhythm

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Game for Final Fantasy

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
So your combat is done

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
The kind of

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Rhythm stuff

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Now Cloud can dance like never before

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Funny that you should mention Cloud

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Because actually I think I see someone

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
In that picture that looks very similar

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I'm just imagining Bust A Move songs

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
In my head with the characters replaced

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
With uh

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Cloud and it's really funny to me I don't know why

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Um yeah it looks kind of neat

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I like rhythm games I like Final Fantasy so maybe

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
I check it out but um yeah I mean for

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
People looking for like a Final Fantasy RPG

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
That's brand new and everything

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Um not quite what you're looking for here

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
So but I check it out

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Looks kind of neat

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
New fanboy worlds colliding

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Pretty much yeah

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
And then on top of that Harmonics is of course

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Working on a new IP called Vithrhythm

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
And that's literally all we know about that

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Um

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
They've just confirmed yeah there's something that we

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Can add to it at this time but

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Yes we are working on that project

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
So maybe a new

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Res type game or something like that

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
That'd be kind of neat we'll see

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Um

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
And then finally this is kind of neat

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Rockstar is um

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Trademarked uh Rockstar Films

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
And um

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Apparently you know one of the

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
People are thinking hey you know what uh

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
They did mention one time that if someone was gonna

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Make Grand Theft Auto into a movie

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
That it would it would be them

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Um you know

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
They said that they would be the ones that would want to

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Handle that um

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
So maybe we'll see some movies coming from

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Actually you know I could see something like

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Uh you know maybe like LA Noire

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Or something like that as a movie from them

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Cause um you know it's a little bit more

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Of a linear story

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Grand Theft Auto would be a little bit kind of crazy

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
I don't know if they could do that but um

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Neat

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
You know they'd be turning some of their games into uh

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Movies

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Neat

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Which would you rather have first a Grand Theft Auto movie

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Or a Red Dead Redemption movie

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Cause I would think Red Dead Redemption would make a better movie

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
I agree that's just me

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Of course

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Cause usually I beat you here to the show

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
So I don't see your car pull up

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
A whole lot but tonight I was late thanks to an accident

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
So um I pull up behind

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
You and I never realized you had a license plate frame

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
That said I'd rather be playing Grand Theft Auto

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Yes I got that a few months back

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
It's nice

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Alright uh some other quick

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
News here uh an interesting spinoff

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Of the Burnout series that's coming to

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Xbox Live Arcade, Burnout

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Crash apparently is coming out

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
By interesting you mean terrible

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
The thing that's interesting about it to me

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Is it's that whole like top down look

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
It looks like

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Remember

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Ivan Ironman Stewart's

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Super Offroad

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
That every round table pizza

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
I guess that's a west coast thing but every pizza

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Joint I guess across the nation had

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
In their little arcade that game was

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Fucking bad ass

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Yeah this looks like one of those type of

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Games but it's fucking Burnout so I don't

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Actually this looks kind of rad

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
I didn't look at the trailer so let me

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Let me look at the trailer cause maybe it is kind of poopy

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
If I see it in motion

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Well they have two different trailers

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
What the?

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
No I do not like the look of freshly colored hair

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Yes see that's the thing about joystick

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Is they always have commercials for like

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Hair products for like women

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
That is like the such wrong demographic

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
I can't wait until I see a douche

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Commercial come up

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
That and like you know hey

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Your children are visiting the internet

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
They could use AOL's blah blah blah

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
To lock down the internet for them

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Do you have Rampant Vaginitis?

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
I don't know if

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
This trailer is going to show gameplay cause they had a

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Teaser one that didn't have any gameplay in it

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
But the gameplay trailer

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Or a little preview

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Not good

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Let me do the YouTube thing instead of like trying to go to a

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Gaming news website I'll just go direct to YouTube

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
But anyways

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Crash time it's

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Basically you know the crash mode

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
That they had in the other games

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Which hey you know what if they wanted to bring that over

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Into it's own game and make it look like the regular

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Burnout games but just be all the crash mode

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
I'd be fine with that

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
This is an Xbox Live Arcade game right?

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
It also supports Kinect

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Notice the hopping up and down icon

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Right there yes in order to make cars explode

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
You have to hop up and down

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
I can turn that bullshit off right?

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Oh fuck it I won't play with that

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Blow up the pizza truck

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
This looks like Super Sprint mixed with

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Burnout I think this is actually kind of rad looking

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Of course there's not a lot going on right now

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
This would be better if they were like actually driving faster

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Or something It's got fire

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Instead of just causing like a 20 car pileup

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Well that's the point see the car pileups

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Or whatever in the destruction it causes

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Your little meter to build up

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
And then you can explode your car Oh that's like

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
There was a mode like that in one of the older Burnout games

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Yeah crash mode that's what this is based off

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
But that's the thing though

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I really wish it was in that format

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
And not necessarily this because the

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Kinect functionality they have it where you drive the car

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Like you make the 10 and 2

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Steering wheel motions or whatever

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
And then you have the hop up and down to make your car explode

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Which I hate I played that racing game

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
It's terrible

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Just don't like it anyhow

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
One game I do like is Torchlight and Runic

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Games announced that Torchlight surpassed a million

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Units sold

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
This would be across the PC the Mac and the 360

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
They haven't said how much on what system

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
But considering it has been discounted on Steam several times

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
I'm pretty sure that helped

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Just like it helped sell Lady Gaga

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
A million albums when Amazon sold it for 99 cents

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Anyhow

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Runic is right now

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Working on Torchlight 2

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
They are still targeting 2011

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
For the launch but they won't allow

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Announce a release date until Runic

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Is closer to being done

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
You can tell that the employees were from

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Blizzard a big chunk of them because

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Blizzard does that same damn thing where it's like

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
It will come out when it's ready

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Kojima Hideo Kojima

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Of course known for the Metal Gear

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Series but also known for

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
A series that was popular in Japan

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Snatcher which kind of has a cult following here

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Announced

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
On the latest edition of his Hideo

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Radio podcast

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Apparently he is going back

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
To something he had announced

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Several years ago but nothing ever came of it

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
He's basically re-announced that

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
A radio drama

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Inspired by the 1998

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Cyberpunk game Snatcher

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
That's been scripted by Suda51

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Called S.D. Atcher

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
It's kind of a spin on

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Suda51's name

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
This is the team up

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Project S thing

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
It's a radio drama

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
It will be released to coincide with the 300th

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Episode of Hideo Radio

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
And Akira Yomoka is going to be doing

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
The music

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Judging by the fact that they're on episode 296

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Now you'll be able to find this episode

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
300. They come out bi-weekly

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
So 300 will be in about what

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
2 months?

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Kind of interesting

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
I'm sure

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Snatcher fans will be very happy to hear that one

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Quite

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Dark Sakura

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
In other news we do have

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Some costumes for LittleBigPlanet2

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
The Final Fantasy 7 pack

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
There's going to be

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
From what I can see on here we have

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Aerith, who cares, Tifa

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
We have Vincent, yay, Cloud

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
And Sephiroth

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Well if you have Aerith you can just jump her off a cliff over and over

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
No, if you've got Aerith you just have to

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Stab her over and over

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Or just hold the square and watch her head explode

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Because remember in LittleBigPlanet2 you can explode

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Your little guy

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
That, okay, that makes it worth it

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
The Sephiroth one's kind of funny

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Looking for the record

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
And then, now I actually

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Saw the trailer for this

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
In the theater

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
For Tekken Blood Vengeance

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
And I was like this looks really cool

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I'm going to see that

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
It does look awesome

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
It is a one night only US showing

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
That's going to be before the Japanese release

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
By a little over a month

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
And it has 20 minutes of interviews with the Tekken staff

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Including

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
The screenwriter

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Dai Sato

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
He also was behind Cowboy Bebop

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Is this going to be one of those horrible

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Live events at the theater things

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
That you always see the commercials for

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Like the whole like, see Coldplay

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Take the stage at Madison Square Garden

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
At your local theater

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
It is like one of those

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
No, you get to see the movie

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
No, no, I know, I know

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Don't you ever see the commercials at the movies

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
For these things that are like

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Well those are Fathom events

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
A night at the Metropolitan

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
And they are going to be doing

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
It is the same thing

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
It's very limited theater

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
They've done other anime

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Things like they did the Death Note movie

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
And the live action Death Note movie

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
And stuff like that

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Rob, we went to see Escaflowne

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
I didn't go to that

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I thought you went with us to see Escaflowne

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I remember a bunch of people went to that

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
I've never seen it

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
They'll probably do this with the Try Again movie when it comes out

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
I also saw, you know

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
I've seen a bunch of movies

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Like I saw Perfect Blue in the theater

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
You went to see Perfect Blue with me, that was it

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
No, I didn't have seen that either

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
I don't think, there's not a lot of animes I've seen in the theater

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
I saw Howl's Moving Castle

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
You've seen Requiem for a Dream, haven't you?

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
No

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
But that's like Salacious Pop's favorite movie

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Yeah, but the guy was a fan of the director of Perfect Blue

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Oh

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Yeah, anyway

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
He actually fully ripped a scene from it

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.000
There's totally a new Studio Ghibli film coming out in a couple weeks in Japan

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
I had no idea

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
There's actually one that just came out already out there

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
But I want it to come out here really desperately

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
It's called Kurigurashi no Arieti

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Which is the borrower

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Arieti from the books The Borrowers

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
I think that's, no that's not it

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
A little tiny girl

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Like the Littles

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
And they live in this old house and this sick boy goes live there

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
And he makes friends with her and everything

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
But the soundtrack is done by

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
A Breton singer

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Anyway, I'm sorry, I'm digressing

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
But no, this is

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
I'm gonna see the movie

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
I really wanna see the movie

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Because I am a huge Tekken fangirl

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
But it's all CG

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
So it's gonna be really cool

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
And it's gonna be on July 26th

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
And then it will be six hours

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Of gorgeous Tekken

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Gooey mess

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
You know what, for OLR's 10th anniversary show

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
I think we should hook up with Fathom Events

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
And make it a one night

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
In the theater special

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
And Dark Soccer will just have to deal with being on the big screen

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
I don't know how expensive that is

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
But I know that they do that for riff tracks

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Do they?

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
It's expensive, but I think it's moderately expensive

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Okay, OLR me

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Call your local theater and demand the

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
OLR 10th anniversary special

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
To come to Fathom Events

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
I'll have a mask made

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
That would be weird

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
I don't know

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
We're packing theaters alright

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
You hear what person?

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Now that we've sat you down

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
And you've paid $10 to come see

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Our big mugs in your local movie theater

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
We thought, what should we do that's special

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
For this 10th anniversary show

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Ferret Vision 3D

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
So we're gonna have Extrofer bleaches asshole

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Live right in front of you on the camera

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Who will have an X rating?

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
It'll be made X for

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Extrofer's bleached asshole

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
It'll be like the time that Katie Couric got her colonoscopy

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
On the Today show, come on

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Anyway, in other news

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Resident Evil

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
HD versions are gonna be coming out

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
On Xbox, on Xbox 360

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
We will have Code Veronica

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
X and Resident Evil 4

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
And they will have a thousand

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Achievement points, ooh

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
So

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Yay

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
But it's going to have

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Here's some of the achievements for Code Veronica

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
There's The Terror Begins, Escape from the

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Graveyard of Terror, A Change Father

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Liberate the Change Man

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
There's Once for Encountering Former Stars Captain

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
So basically it's stuff that happens in the game anyway

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Um

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
And uh

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Actually, there's a comparison up

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Of the uh

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
You just have to look around on the internet, but there's a

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Comparison between Resident Evil 4

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
The original, and uh

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
The HD version

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Since I don't have my GameCube hooked up anymore

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Or my, I mean I can always use the Wii, but my friends

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Borrowed Resident Evil 4

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Like, I'm actually really interested in this

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Cause unlike some people in the room, I really liked

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Resident Evil 4

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
I didn't dislike Resident Evil 4, but I loved Code Veronica

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
And I liked the second one best

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Ah, alright

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Because the two that were supposed to look like

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Leonardo DiCaprio, totally got killed

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Akuma JP in the chat room

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Is asking, will I be able to save

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Yes

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
You just will not be able to erase those saves

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
As long as you have enough typewriter ribbon

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
That's the

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Perfect answer, DarkSakura

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Perfect answer

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I'm actually going to link the articles in the chat room

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
So people can watch the comparison

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Amazing

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Tweet time! Twitter.com slash

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
OLR if you want to send us your tweets

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
As our listeners do every week

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
And we will go through some of those tweets right now

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
And uh, let's see

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
First off, I want to do a tweet

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
From Mad Gear Store

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Who tweeted a bunch of people

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Who did a nice game selection in California Extreme

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
And tweeted us a picture of some of the

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Um, Bamani that was going up there

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
And I gotta say, I'm actually kinda sad

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
I'm actually, well I'm not kind of sad

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
I'm really sad that actually I missed California Extreme

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
It just, it was just on a bad

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Weekend this year, I had a lot going on

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
This weekend you guys

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
And I think the others did too, and it's just hard

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I could have gone this morning

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
But I couldn't have justified paying

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
30 bucks and only being there about 4 hours

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Which is what would have happened

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
So I would have wanted to be there yesterday

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Like all night long

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
So, unfortunately I couldn't make that happen

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Blue Swim tweeted us earlier in the week

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Going, I usually listen to podcasts

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
As I'm going to sleep

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Had several episodes of OLR playing

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
And I ended up dreaming about them

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Is that creepy that people like dream of us

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
We didn't hear what was in the dream

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Hopefully it wasn't an erotic dream

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
I dare not

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
I don't think it was

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Redertainment sent a tweet earlier

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
I actually responded to it, but I wanted to bring it up

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
On the show, and Redertainment asked

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
So when are you going to incorporate

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Google Plus into the show

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
This is the new social network everyone's talking about

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
We like to be on the cutting edge

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Of those types of things

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
As soon as we find a way

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
To do it, we will

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Google has actually asked that small and medium

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Businesses stop making personal profiles

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Because they will roll out

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
A business thing, kind of like how

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Facebook has business pages

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
They're going to roll that out later in the year, I guess

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
So as long as we can do it for free

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Or like, really cheap

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
We're going to look at doing something like that

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Where we can keep our fans posted

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Assuming that Google Plus has something you want

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
And you know, we're gamers like you

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
And if this whole thing ends up being

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Spam, spamity, spam, spam

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
We wouldn't do that, we're not going to contribute to that

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
But, you know, if it's a place where you can

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Be in a community and talk about games

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
And, you know, meet other people that don't want to be

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Jerks on playing online games

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Then I'm all for that

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
But Google Plus, its biggest

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Problem right now is that there's not

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
A lot there, like you can see

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
What they're building, and a lot of people

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Are really liking what they see in the foundation

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
But there's certainly a lot of other people

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Who look at Google Plus and go

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
There's fucking nothing there right now, it's so vanilla

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
So, I think

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Google Plus just needs some time to grow

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
And then we can really see what we can do with it

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Uh, mnziba

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Are you alright there?

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Are you alright? Is a bug attacking you?

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Is a fly attacking you for massive damage?

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Hit its weak point

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
There you go, she got a Kleenex

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
And hit its weak point

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Squished it to death

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
I broke one of its wings

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Yikes, mnziba sends us a tweet

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Saying, this video made me go back to

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
FFXI or Final Fantasy 11

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
How many of these scenes have you seen in game?

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
So I'm looking at a little

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
A little scenery

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
A little quaint scene

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Of plants growing

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
I don't know what this is

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
It's supposed to be like a garden, I gotta skip ahead a little bit

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
I think it's just some of the

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Pretty shit in game

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Sent to pretty music

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
You know what?

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I gotta say, it's funny

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
You know, you sent this tweet before I told my story

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
At the top of the break about how I got FFXI

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Bought for me, but it actually was

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Thinking about a lot of the great scenery

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
And ambiance in that game

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Despite the dated graphical technology

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
That had me thinking like

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
I wonder what it looks like now

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
I wonder if they've made some changes

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
And why FFXIV was so fucking disappointing

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Because it should have been

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
11 improved in high def

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
But instead it was 11

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Flushed down a toilet in high def

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
And that was what was very disappointing about it

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Redertainment sent us another tweet saying

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
I'd like to start the rumor that the PlayStation 4

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Will feature Body Movin', the hit song

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
From the Beastie Boys

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Get it? Because it rips off the connect

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Get it?

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Spazernator tweets us and says

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
No news on free PlayStation Network videos

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
For a while with the fact that my system being

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Dead and needing to be repaired

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Yeah, I heard about this, I guess he got the yellow

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Lie to death on the PlayStation

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
And he does not have good luck with PlayStation

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Yet he supports someone

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
I know, rude Sony

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Rude, rude Sony

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Sj100matt tweets us

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Has Hollywood really run out of ideas?

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
The Space Invaders movie rights

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Have been optioned

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
And tweets us to a story

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I thought this had already happened some time ago

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
But it's making the rounds again

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
The Taito classic arcade game

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Space Invaders has been optioned

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
By veteran Hollywood producers

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
The film rights were optioned by

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Lorenzo de Beneventura

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Who made Transformers, G.I. Joe

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
and Salt and Odd Lot

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Entertainment who is behind

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Upcoming movies Drive and Ender's Game

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I guess they've

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Also optioned Asteroids

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Ah, I see

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Last year Warner Brothers allegedly

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Was seeking the Space Invaders rights itself

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
But that venture fell through

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Where would you make a fucking

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Movie out of Space Invaders?

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Like, wouldn't it just be Independence

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Day but called Space Invaders?

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Yes, they're never gonna make a better alien

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Film than Independence Day

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
But the soundtrack would be

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
No, well, the new Space Invaders game

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Has had fucking rad soundtracks

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Like, that would be cool

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
How about techno rave version of Independence Day?

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
There you go

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Today is our Independence Day

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Ooh, ooh

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
DJ Rama S sent us a tweet

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
About Pac-Man to become a reality show

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Didn't this come up on last week's show?

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
I have a little question mark over my head

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
I guess I'll quickly read this

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
But I guess Pac-Man is coming to life with a new

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Reality series

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Merv Griffin Entertainment is developing an unscripted show

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
About the pellet eating yellow blob

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Chased by Inky Binky Pinky and Clyde

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
It's to coincide with the 30th anniversary

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Of the video game

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
It's a big, crazy, wipe out

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Type event with a lot of energy

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
The idea we have is to take what Pac-Man

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Is and bring it to life

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
To bring what is essentially the world's biggest game

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Of tagged television

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Sounds like a game show

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
They say a reality show

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Like a game show

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
I consider Wipeout a game show more than a reality show

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
You know

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
At first when I read the headline

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Pac-Man to become a reality show

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Now I hear Pac-Man to become a game show

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
And if it's done right

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
It might actually be kind of cool

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Isn't there some show coming to NBC

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Like take the money and run or something

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
That's supposed to be like people have 48 hours

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
To hide $100,000

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
And if they can keep the money

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Hidden from the feds for 48 hours

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Or something like that like actual federal agents

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
That try to chase them down and the money

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
For themselves because the fed agents are competing

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
For the money like if they can find it in 48 hours

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
And they get to keep it and I'm like that

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Sounds kind of awesome like

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
I like shows about like

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
That type of stuff I would do that

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
You would do how would you hide the money

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
How would you win that show

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
You package it up

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Send it second day air

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
To somewhere

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
To your house or something like that

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
But couldn't the federal agents like trace

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Everywhere you've been and your steps

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
And the packages you've sent

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
You immediately invest it

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
You immediately invest the money

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Well I'm sure there's rules

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
You probably have to physically hide the money somewhere

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
I'm guessing

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
I don't know it's just something

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Like capturing the concept of the show

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
But I don't know it sounds kind of awesome

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
There was another show I don't think it was out here

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
But I think it was in um

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Britain or something called Jailbreak

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
That was just about like whoever could

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Escape from jail first won like

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Obscene amount of money

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
And who's seen too many Steve McQueen movies

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
I'll tell you what I'm

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Look I'm a game show addict

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
I grew up on like old school match game

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
And USA network game shows like Scrabble

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
And pressure luck and all that shit like

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
That shit was awesome

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
But I'll tell you my favorite reality

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Game show they ever did

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Ever ever it's not

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Survivor it's not Big Brother I think the best

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Like reality game show they ever did was The Mole

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
When it was hosted by Anderson Cooper

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Like back in the day it was like a fucking

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
James Bond game yeah it was like

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Ten players yet one of them

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Fred Savage would show up with a mole on his face

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
No no not that kind of mole I know

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
But one player was working against the other

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Players they brought it back for a revival

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Series a couple years ago but it wasn't as good

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Well then they had the celebrity mole and then they had another

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Real mole but it wasn't as good cause Anderson Cooper

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Like made that show

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Cause he's just the man but it was like James Bond

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
And I would like

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
I'd kill someone to be on that

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Show not literally I'd kill a fly like

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Dark Soccer just did I'd do that I didn't just

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Kill it Rob I squished it and pinched it

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
You torched it I hate

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
No I hate flies and now keep in mind I usually comfort myself

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
By saying they'll die in two days anyway because

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
They have a really short lifespan but this

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Fly has been buzzing all over my damn house

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
So I have a feeling of accomplishment

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
And satisfaction and damn it I deserve

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Twinkie

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Alright we have a lot of

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Fucking tweets today but I gotta get through some of these

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Others okay Sturlock tweets us and now

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Remember I said I wanted to hear from blind gamers

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Sturlock I know is a blind gamer and tweets

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Us about the whole glasses story from part A

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
The glasses thing is actually pretty neat

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Don't have enough usable vision

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
For that but like the concept so

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Unfortunately you know it's not

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Gonna work for everybody but

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
It's still cool that it will help

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Some people I think that's still really cool

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
And I think Sturlock sees that too

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Tigerclaw305

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Tweets us saying

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Katamari creator working on a different kind

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Of MMO

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
What kind of MMO would the person behind

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Katamari Demashi make

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Let's see

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Tiny Spec a small developer

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Founded by former Flickr employees

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Wasn't Spec the name of

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Pee Wee Herman's dog

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
In the Pee Wee's Big Adventure movie

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Spec

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Yeah

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
I thought you were talking about what was in his pants

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Shut up

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Announced today that

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Takahashi who is

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
The guy behind Katamari

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Demashi moved from Tokyo to Vancouver

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
To contribute to Glitch

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
It's web based MMOs

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Ooh there's even a trailer let's take a look real quick

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
You know he actually got hired to design a

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Playground

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Well yeah I knew he was doing the Playground but

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
I see

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
All these people like little avatars

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
And they're jumping around like

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
It looks like a 2D

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Platformer game

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
There's something

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
LittleBigPlanet-ish about this

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
To me

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
I'm not saying that's what the game is

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
It's just

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.000
LittleBigPlanet on mushrooms

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
There was a wheel

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
And I quickly caught the text

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
On that and it said booty prize

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
I said booty

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Anyway

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
It looks a little silly

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
That's kind of cool

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
I guess if it's free

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
I'll check it out but if it's not

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
I'll have to hear more about it

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
To see if it's worth it

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Here's a question from Tigerclaw

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Nintendo researching mobile phone possibilities

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
That's kind of a big deal

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
How did I miss that one?

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Think about it guys

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Let's see

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Satoru Iwata responded to a fantastic question

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Pitched at a recent shareholder Q&A that began

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
I own some shares but I do not have any Nintendo products

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Basically I think games are a waste of time

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
And therefore I would like a product that has value

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Added to it so that even I would buy one

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Let's see

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
If we had never considered combining a mobile phone

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
We would be negligent

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
But on the other hand mobile phones are subject to monthly fees

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
And we need to consider how well this would fit with game devices

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Or how we should balance these aspects

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
According to this mobile phone companies

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Are generally divided by countries

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
And when running a business on a worldwide basis

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
We need to consider in what conditions

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Can we partner up with mobile phone companies

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Around the world

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Please understand that we are still researching these areas

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
I gotta say

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
No disrespect to the tweet

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Or the story or what have you

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
This sounds like a whole lot of nothing

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Absolutely nothing

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
This sounds like Iwata just completely dodging this question

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
He didn't want to tell the guy

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
No we're not doing a fucking mobile phone

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
He just wanted to give this big answer about

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Well if we did that we'd have to do this and this

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
But it's something we're always looking into

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Just say no

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
So that they'll say oh it's something we may be looking into

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
But when it comes to actually you know

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Talking about games that they're porting over

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Oh that no

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
I had my hopes up

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
That this was going to be a story about like

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I don't know Mario Brothers on my iPhone or something

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
How silly of me

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
How silly of me

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
WatchDragon tweets us saying

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Going old school just beat Tyrion

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Does anyone remember Tyrion?

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Anyone?

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
It was an epic mega games shooter

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
From 94

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
And the minute I saw a screen

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
I admit I cheat and I googled it because I'm like what is this

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
And the minute I saw a screenshot I'm like

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
What a fucking game back when it was shareware

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I guess the whole thing was released

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
In 2007 as uh

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Or no Freeware in 04

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
And the graphics are open license

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
As of April of 07

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
That's kind of cool

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Where can you download this game? I'll give a shout out

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
For the download let's see

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Uhhhh

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Official Tyrion repository

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Freewebs.com

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Slash world tree games

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
There you go

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
One more tweet last tweet

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
AlphaCananagram tweets us

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Did y'all talk about Play for Japan coming out today?

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Sorry many distractions on my end today

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Actually we didn't it hasn't come up yet

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
So we should say

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
That the Play for Japan album is out today

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
So if you have not checked it out in iTunes

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
To see if it's something you want to get

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
And help out a good cause

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
You probably should do that after the show

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Play for Japan is out

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
That does it for Twitter tonight

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Twitter.com slash OLR

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Future week back to gaming news

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Loki

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Sorry distracted by a very very strange

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Picture of Katy Perry for some reason

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Why is it that she has like

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
That

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
I don't understand it that doesn't make any sense

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Why is she famous?

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
She's famous because she's willing

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
To wear a dress that has

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Whipped cream dispensers

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
On her nipples that is why she is

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Famous

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I gotta admit she does have some good songs

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
I feel like she's a better song writer

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
She does have some good nipples

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
That makes sense

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Nintendo is actually

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
In line again for another lawsuit

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
If it's not motion sensors

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
It's now gonna be 3D

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
So they are facing a lawsuit over

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
The 3DS technology mainly the

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Screen

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Of course a company that you probably never heard of

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Before Tomata Technologies

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Has a patent suit against Nintendo

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Because they have the patent for technology

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Relating to displaying stereoscopic images

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
On screen for viewing with a naked eye

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
I.e. without glasses

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Or other devices

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Filed in 2003 grinded in 2008

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
And of course you know

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
They've run up

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Suits for the Wii Fit

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
GameCube classic controllers

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Control ports etc.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
The funny thing about this though is

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Nintendo doesn't make those screens

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Sharp does

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Oops

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
So Nintendo licensed

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
The screen technology from Sharp or whatever

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Contracted Sharp to put those screens in

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Yeah

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
And some of the people

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
They were commenting and they were all as expected

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Googled Tomata Technologies

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Feels the only notable thing that they've ever done

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Is sue Nintendo

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Once again one of those patent

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Sniping

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Companies I guess

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Patent trolls I feel like patent trolls need a theme

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Song here on the show

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
We'll look into that for the future

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Anyhow I am glad I waited

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
To buy this game because the new version

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
That's coming out on Playstation Network sounds kinda awesome

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
It's Castlevania Harmony of Despair

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
If you don't remember this game

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
It's the HD Castlevania game that was released

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Almost a year ago on the Xbox 360

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
It's finally coming out to the

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Playstation 3

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
But the good news is your wait may pay off

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Because the PSN version of the game

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
It will come with a new

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Local 4 player cooperative mode

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Including the 6 player online mode

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
There's also going to be the beauty

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Desire situation desire map pack

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
And some extra carriers

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Carriers, characters that will carry

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Whips and other weapons

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Julius Belmont and Yoko Belonades

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
So kinda cool

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
You know I played the demo

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Of this game and I was kinda like

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
But I have a lot of friends that are really into it

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
And I think I need to give it a second chance

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
So I will definitely check it out on PSN

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
So yeah very cool

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Dr. Sakura

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
In other news

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
For fans of Nights like me

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
There is an

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
OC Remix album put out

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
It's called Lucid Dreaming

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
It is a free download

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
And it has

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
25 arrangements

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
And 2 bonus tracks

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
From Nights

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Into Dreams

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
And it's actually put out as an anniversary release

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Because 15 years ago

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
It came out on Sega Saturn

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
So it is available at

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
lucid.ocremix.org

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
And I am

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Going to be downloading the crap out of this when I'm done

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
You love Nights right?

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Oh yeah Nights is fun although it always made me

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Motion sick

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
But yeah it's an overclocked remix

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
The whole album is overclocked so

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
OC Remix has been getting

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
More and more exposure it seems over the years

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Didn't they do the remix soundtrack

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
For the Street Fighter 2

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Remix

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I think they said this is their 26th album

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
That they've done

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Well yeah but this is

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Doesn't this have some type of backing by Sega

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Or no this is just a fan thing

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
I think this is just a fan thing

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Oh my bad I thought for some reason it was like an endorsed thing

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Well still really cool yeah

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
No they've done a few fan albums

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Like the Final Fantasy 7 one

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
There was probably several more than one

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
I think there was a Mega Man one too so yeah I'm not surprised

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
That's cool

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
It's under about

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
And uh

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
No it doesn't say that

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
It just says the fan project so

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
I'll link the website in the chatroom

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Alright

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Loki

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
You know

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
It was a matter of time

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
We even hinted that this is something

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
That may happen and sure enough

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Sony has announced

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Or I shouldn't even say they've announced

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
It was mainly found out

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
That they were going to be doing this and then they acknowledged

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Yeah we're doing it

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
There is now going to be a

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
PlayStation network pass on

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
First party games from Sony

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Basically this is just like the other online

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Passes Project 10 dollars

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
What the fuck you want to call it?

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Ripping off people that are buying used

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Pass

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
That will be included starting with

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Resistance 3

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Basically you have to have this network pass in order to play

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Online

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
If you're buying it used

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Since it's a one time use code

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
And the code has been used you have to purchase it

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
For an unset amount of money

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
But I think it's just

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Could it be 10 dollars?

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
It could be 10 dollars

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
It could be 5 dollars

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
That's what other companies are doing

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
I don't like this trend at all

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
I don't know

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
It looks like you may be out of luck Loki

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
It looks like everybody is jumping on board

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
What makes this notable I'm sure in many ways

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
We're not talking a third party developer

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
We're talking fucking Sony's on board

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
With this

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Which is interesting because Sony always made a big deal about how

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
PSN is free

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Yeah it's free if you buy it new

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
But then

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
I don't know it's stupid

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
I'm sorry

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
It's just like if you use it

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
They're using the excuse

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Well if you buy it used

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
The developer doesn't get any of that money

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
No they already got that money when the game was purchased

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
It's just new

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
I don't understand

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
But you should buy all your games new

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Oh it's a stupid argument

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Just like you buy all your CDs new

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Just like how you buy all your clothes new

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
There's no such thing as a thrift store

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Macy's doesn't get money

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
When you buy that used clothes

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
At a garage sale

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Too bad

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Then you need to make your games better

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
So those people think that it's worth paying

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
60 dollars for

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
To drop your prices down

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
To a reasonable amount

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Where people feel it's necessary to buy

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
I'm sorry

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
It's just after all the

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Bullshit that they've done with other things

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
I don't know

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Why people put up with it

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Let me put it this way

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
If you're still interested in playing this game online

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
And buying it new is not for you

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
What I recommend doing is waiting a good year

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Before it drops down in price

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
If that's not good enough for you

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
It's sucker new

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Or just shop around

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
A lot of people drop the prices of those games

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
At launch

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
That entice people to come buy there

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
And so you may be able to find it

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Cheaper than that

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Or if you're in the case of me

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Which I could give a rat's ass about

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Resistance

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
It's multiplayer

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
It wouldn't matter to me either way

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
But once again

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
I'm just not gonna buy it

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
I hope Microsoft is smart

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
And decides not to do this

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
I hope that they say

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Hey you know what

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
We're not gonna jump on this bandwagon

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Because I have a feeling

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
They're either gonna jump on it

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Because everybody else is doing it

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Or they're gonna hold strong and say

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Hey you know what we don't need to do that

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Because it's gonna look really bad

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
If they do it

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Because they're charging for online

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
And then they're charging again

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
For you to get access on

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Nah I don't know

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
That's where I'm kind of at with Dark Toa Gak

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Because I'm like you know

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
I understand why you're pissed off at Sony

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
But I'm a little worried that this is just the first

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Of everybody jumping on board with this

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Of course I don't buy a lot of games

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Used

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
But I kind of like having that option

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Available to me

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Especially when they go out of print

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
It's also rentals

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
If you're going on Gamefly or something like that

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
And you want to play the online portion of this

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Well you're fucking out of luck

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Unless you want to

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Pay ten dollars or whatever

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Alright

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Let's move on

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
I want to talk to you about a Facebook game

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Yes a Facebook game but this is one that's been

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Making a lot of heads turned this week

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Civilization World finally

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Launched on Facebook

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
How do you like that? Remember how I bitched about how I didn't have an invite?

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Well I did get one later that night

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
So thank you Dark Tetsuya for hooking me up with that

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
And not even three days later it went public

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Which is fine

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
At least I got to have a somewhat

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Early look at it

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
But yes Civilization World is a new Facebook game

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
And it's turning a lot of people's heads

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Because a lot of people are going

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
This is a really good game

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
And it's a Facebook game

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
I got to be honest

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
At its core I still feel like

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
There's a lot of elements that make it very

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Facebook-y

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Like the whole, hey do you want to get more harvests

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
In an hour? Give us your money

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Do you want to get more culture generation?

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Give us your money

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Do you want to get extra bonuses and other perks?

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Give us your money

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
So there's a lot of that going on in Civ World

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
But otherwise there are a lot of

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Kind of cool elements to it

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
One of the things I like about it is a Facebook

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Game because I did spend, obviously I spent

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Quite a bit of time with it this week

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
I just neglected to mention it during my gaming week

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Because I was pissed off because I couldn't get in today

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Because they're having a lot of server issues today

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Because I think the game is just too damn popular

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
I think they're crushing under the weight of the popularity

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Of the game

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
But anyhow

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
I was playing some of the game, but one of the things I really like about it

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Is that you work with a nation

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
You can join a nation

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
To kind of better yourselves

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
And you're supposed to be working with these people

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
So that you can

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Beat other nations and you can get the technologies

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
You need to advance yourself as a nation

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
But at the same time

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
You're kind of against these same people

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Because there's also competition

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Going on amongst you guys for

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Who is on top of your nation

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
And whoever is on the top of your nation

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Gets more votes and a bigger say

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
To drive the entire nation

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
So I kind of like that

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Whole teamwork with a knife

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
To your back type of thing

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
There's something about that kind of gameplay

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
That's actually really rad

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
And I think that's the element that this game has

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
That no other Facebook game has

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
And why the rest of it

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
It really has nothing

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
It's not fucking civilization

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I'm sorry, when I played it

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
It has similar music

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
And it has the concepts of

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Trade, science, agriculture

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
And culture

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Really growing a city

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
But after that

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
I don't know, a lot of the similarities

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
To civilization

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Kind of end

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
I guess you still have the science tree

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
There's some really weird minigames that have nothing to do with civilization

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
That doesn't mean I don't like it though

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
I like it

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
If I really want to play civilization

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
I'm going to go back and play Civ 5

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
You know what I mean?

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
This isn't going to get me to quit playing piece of civilization

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Yeah, it's like

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
It's a civilization Facebook game

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
But it's the fact that they've worked so hard on this

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
And that I think Sid Meier

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Is actually involved

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I think led to this whole other angle

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
That Zynga would have never come up with

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
I'm sorry

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Is not capable of

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Gaming an invention

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Like this right now

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Because I think they're just all about

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Pushing out

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Clones of what's essentially the same damn game

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Between the mafia wars

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
And the sorority wars

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
And the farmvilles

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
And the cityvilles

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
And whatevervilles

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
So

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
So yeah, Civ world

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
The story is that yes

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
It launched on Facebook

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
So if you are waiting for an invite

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Why wait? Go play

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
The game may be down for maintenance or something though

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
But yeah

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
In some of the reviews I'm hearing

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Is that it has a lot of the just one more turn quantities

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Of civilization

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
And yeah, that's kind of true

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
But there is a point where there isn't a lot to do

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
But hover your mouse over

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Waiting for little bonus

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Science outputs and things like that

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
But I don't know

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I think it's better than most

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Facebook games I've ever played

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
You know what's more fun than a Facebook game though?

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Emails

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
And the emails you send to us every week

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
At mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Darzagra is gonna dive

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
In the mailbag right now and read some emails

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
For us to respond to

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
We actually got something from

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Holly

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
So thanks for reporting on this

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
I've contacted my senator and my congressman

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
And sent it on to my friends and family

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Hopefully if everyone tells them no

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
We can get this nonsense blocked

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Bravo, good job

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
That's what everybody should be doing

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
By the way we have a follow up coming later in the show

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
We'll get to it in a minute

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
This comes from Rubba

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Rubba, who I think added me on Steam the other day

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Cool

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
You had a really good caller last week

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Who discussed the kids that were Crestfallen

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
About the closure of Virtual Magic Kingdom

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
You also discussed the Star Wars Momo closing

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
These things are really good lessons

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
To children and adults alike

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
They should learn 1. Everything ends

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Your dog will die, the batteries won't last forever

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
And MMOs or businesses will stop supporting it someday

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
I think this is more for the younger crowd

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
2. Virtual goods are not goods

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
They will someday disappear

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
In an instant when the MMO closes

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
This is why I find

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Placing cash value on gold or items

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
To be an utter waste of time

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Adults still need to learn this lesson

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
3. You will not always

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Get what you want

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
It's funny that many of today's Americans don't understand this concept

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Amen

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
And on the bright side 4

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Something new and shiny will come along

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
To make you forget about the old MMO

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
So there we have it

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Dealing with loss, bubble economies, humility and optimism

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Rubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Things will end and your dog

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Will die

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
This is kind of a Debbie Downer email

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
It's true though

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Your email gets a sad trombone

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
It's true though isn't it?

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
It is but

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
It goes back to my old rant about Americans

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
And this sense of self entitlement

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Everyone thinks that

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Everyone owes them something and they don't want to

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Work for anything and you know what?

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Bite my ass

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Oh except that's too much effort for you to come to my house and bite my ass

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Well what about, well you better be careful

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Because there's some creepsters out there who might actually try to show up at your door

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
And say I'm here to bite your ass ma'am

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
I'll kick her in the balls

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
What if it's a girl?

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
I'll kick her in the clit

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Alright

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
That hurts kind of bad

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
I would imagine

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Anyhow wow I just didn't think you'd say that

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
But what about, okay what about the whole angle of

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
But I paid for stuff in the game

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
And yeah I realize the address is in the email

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
But I don't know like

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
I can see the disappointment if you've actually like put money

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
And time into this and then suddenly it's like

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Oh I've pulled the plug

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Well you know what I'll be disappointed and sad when my cat dies

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
I guess you've poured a lot of money into her

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Visits and I've bought that bed down there

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
And I feed her and I take care of her

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
But one day she's gonna go

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
You know I'm very sad I love my cat

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
But you know

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
I've, my computer here

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
I've got all this shit on it

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Grandma and grandpa gonna die

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
But you don't need to tell them that

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Cause they already know

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
I don't know when

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
I don't know how

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:50.000
But one day they gonna die

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.000
But you don't need to tell them that

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
World of Warcraft

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
They know already

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Yeah but I mean seriously

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
You know

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
Your Playstation's gonna break

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
One day

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Ask Spassinator

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
I know yeah Spassinator should know all about that

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Your Xbox is gonna

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Be a bed ring

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
That little beta that you've got

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
In your pot on your desk at work

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Is gonna die

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Well aren't we just a fucking

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
One day your house will burn down

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
And you won't live there anymore

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
No but seriously everything

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Has an end

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Face it

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Just because you liked it and it was fun

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Including OLR

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
No

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Just because you liked it and it was fun

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
And you get to have it forever

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Grow up

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Okay

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Last one

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
And it comes from Robert Mmm

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
I recently picked up Atari's

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Greatest Hits Volume 1 on the DS

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
First major points off for including

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Atari Video Cube instead of Yars

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Revenge. The games do

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Play very well though and although the small screen

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Hurts arcade games such as Gravatar

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
They control pretty spot on to the originals

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
I noticed on the back of the box

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
The proclamation the most popular

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Casual games of all time

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Interesting. Do you consider retro games

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
To be casual you know unless you're

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Steve Weeby or something

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Um

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
They were just different back then

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Interesting. Interesting. I think a lot of retro games

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Are just very simple in concept

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Were they casual? I think a lot of people

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Take a casual approach to it cause I know

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
When you have emulators

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
And you can sample everything at the buffet

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
People will play games for five seconds

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
I remember this. Next game

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
I remember this. It's like

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
It's like you lick the vanilla ice cream

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
This tastes good. You lick the chocolate ice cream

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
This tastes good too

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
But back in the day when you would drop

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
$50 on those games like they

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Entertained you for a long time

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Well and I'm gonna

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
I'm actually gonna use a comparison from

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Design theory actually

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Okay

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Back then first of all

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
You didn't have a lot of space to actually

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Game on so you had to do the most you

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Could with the most simple of tools by

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Today's standards right?

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Also we had a longer attention

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Span as people back then

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
I really think so because today

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
I mean we're bombarded

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
With everything and I don't know

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
If you've looked in a magazine from say

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
1970

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
1975

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
And looked like at an article

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
For like pantyhose

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
And it has this big long description

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Of why you want to use legs

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
And all of this stuff

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
And they really a lot of text a lot of

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Information on there and now

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
An ad is usually just a picture of

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
A face or a leg

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
And legs

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Buy it

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Or if it's like a

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Catalog for Abercrombie and Fitch

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
It's just naked

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Good looking 20 year olds

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Butts but it's to sell

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Clothes and they sell clothes through

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Nudity

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Where it's like

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
You pull up a 50's ad for the toasters

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
And it's like this makes some fucking

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Amazing toast and the toast will brown

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
Just right and Mrs. Cleaver

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Loves it and she uses this toaster every day

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
This toaster really gets my

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Toast buttered and I love this toaster

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
And it's economical and it looks great

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
In the kitchen

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
In fact I actually remember recently

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Seeing an article for like these

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Ugly ass plaid bell bottom pants

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
In the 70's and it said

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Like something

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Stretch fiber pants for today's modern

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Man these type of pants are for the

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Man who wants to get up and put on his pants and

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Go and it was really

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Describing it you know like you were watching

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
A TV commercial or something

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Well even television commercials now are pretty

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Simple to the point you know

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Because our attention

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
To pants are shorter we are bombarded

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
With so much information

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
And it just gets to be more

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
It's gonna be like our photo albums in the future

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Are gonna be like from The Last Starfighter

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
When the dude shows the little square

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
And it's like 50 million pictures all at once

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
When dude's got here's my photo

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
There's them and them

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Well wouldn't that just be like one of those digital picture frames

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Yeah except it does

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
A photo a second

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Actually I think it did like a photo every half

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Second or something but still

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
The point is is that we had longer

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Attention spans back then and I think a little bit

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
More in the way of determination we were satisfied

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
With less because back then

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
That was our big thing

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
And then it keeps pushing

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
The envelope and pushing the envelope and now we have

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Such high expectations

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
That

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Really if it

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
You know doesn't hit that

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Factor where it's gonna something's gonna change

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Every five seconds and hold your attention

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
That's exactly what's gonna happen you're gonna lose

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Interest in it and you're gonna move on

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Speaking of which let's get to the next email

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
There's no more emails

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
No more

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
We're out of email

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
And just like that the mailbag segment

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Has died this week

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
If you want to contribute to next week's mailbag

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:26.000
In the meantime let's get to some FUs of the week

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:30.000
I don't really have an FU actually

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Ok FU to alcohol for making my face break out

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Loki?

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:40.000
I don't have a lot of FUs because I'm coming off a high

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
Of a really really great weekend

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:46.000
But I will say I did have a really bad day this week

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Where just a lot of stuff was going on

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Most of it was work related

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
And then of course everything that I talked about on wow

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Like and it's kind of funny

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Like I think I took it out on this week's

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Episode of Horde House because

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
You know a lot of my guildies that um

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
I've been playing with for you know a couple years now

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Actually a lot of them listen to the show

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
And I actually was getting text messages from people going

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:10.000
God you are so cunty on this week's Horde House

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
And I'm like I was having a bad day

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:15.000
And I got home at 5.55 and the show had to start at 6

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
What do you want from me?

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
But otherwise things are fucking fantabulous

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
And I had an amazing weekend

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:28.000
And I it just it erased the memory of my bad day

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:31.000
Except for the fact that I did remember it to rant about it

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
But now it's done I'm done

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
We're not done with the news yet though

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
We have a few more stories for you guys

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
And then the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
We're not there quite yet

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:46.000
By the way I've kept Twitter open in another window

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
And we got another tweet that came in real quick

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:53.000
From Zether77 tweeted us saying

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
You can also get Tyrion

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
Cause we mentioned that game earlier on good ol' games

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
GOG

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
I was not aware but now I am

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
I wonder how much I'll have to check that out

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Let's get to a couple more news stories for you guys

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:10.000
We talked about last week said that Bill 978

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Where it may affect gameplay videos on YouTube and stuff like that

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:20.000
So if you uploaded pictures of yourself playing a game or something like that

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:24.000
And showing the gameplay that that may be considered copyrighted acts

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:29.000
And that you'd be basically slapped with a felony charge

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
And jail time

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Apparently though the way the bill is worded now

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:37.000
They're saying that it's actually may not be the case

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Basically the statue can only be enforced in instances

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Where uploaders are willfully infringing on the copyright

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
With the intent to make money

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:49.000
And is only punishable if said uploader makes

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:53.000
Or the game company loses over $2500

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:57.000
And that's probably not gonna be the case for most walkthroughs and stuff like that

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Doesn't totally change my opinion

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
I still think it's stupid

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:05.000
I think this report that you're giving us

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.000
I mean don't blame you I know you're getting it from a game blog somewhere

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
And what folks are reporting on the web

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
But it's a little bit smoke and mirrors to me

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
Because I don't think it detracts from the real issue

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:17.000
That okay well where as a lot of individuals

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
What about the middle man

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:24.000
You know review companies from businesses that are not IGN one up etc

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000
But you know still need those hits

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:31.000
I mean for me this is really bad for small business

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Yeah cause I mean they say oh well you know

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Unless the company loses over $2500

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Yeah but you know these RIA

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:42.000
The RIA said that oh these record companies have lost millions of dollars

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
From one MP3 download

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
So you know they can make that shit up

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Off the top of their heads

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:53.000
So you know why not say oh yeah this YouTube video of some of the gameplay streaming

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
That cost us so much money

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Or what if you had

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
How can you prove that a YouTube lost $2500

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Exactly

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:04.000
Couldn't a game company say because you gave my game a negative review

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
We lost all these sales

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:09.000
Everybody that watched your thing was a potential sale

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:12.000
I mean that seems so vague and rude this is a shittily written law

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:15.000
Just like I said last week and yes I used that word last week and I'm using it again

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Shittily

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
Shittily's law

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Yeah it's not

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Not good

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:31.000
Hey let's talk about origin vs steam and some of the follow ups to that

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:34.000
I teased this a little bit before and after this story we'll get into your calls

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:39.000
A forum post was posted by EA senior vice president of global e-commerce

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Saying that gamers should be able to buy EA titles on any site they want including steam

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
But here's the thing

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:50.000
I guess what happened is that the crisis 2 disappearing from valve service

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
Was the result of a business deal

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Where certain DLC for the game couldn't appear on steam

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:59.000
So valve removed the title completely

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Basically valve is like you know because

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Valve wants to facilitate all the downloads and patches within its own system

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Which for us the consumer I think is really good

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
That's why a lot of us like steam

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:13.000
But EA is like no we want control of that

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
So now there's a power struggle going on here

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Well anyhow the forum post went on to say that the origin platform is a choice for game buyers

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Not an exclusive outlet for all the publishers content going forwards

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:27.000
EA is working to integrate more and more between the game and origin

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
According to the post

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:32.000
I'm absolutely not at this point saying hey it's origin versus steam

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
It's never been about that

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:38.000
I don't know if I totally believe that but we'll see

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:43.000
EA wants to continue offering our games for sale on all major download sites

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:46.000
However you say that on one hand and then on the other hand

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:50.000
Didn't they announce that star wars the old republic will only be on the new EA store

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:54.000
So already there is a contradiction in your post

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:58.000
So it makes me a little bit apprehensive to believe anything else you're saying

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Anyhow EA posted some digital retailers that are going to be carrying battlefield 3

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
And guess who's not on it

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Yeah it's totally not origin versus steam

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:13.000
It has nothing to do with trying to crack things up

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:17.000
It's because they're really trying to offer download content on their own

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:20.000
And steam is being so bad and not letting them do that

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:24.000
I don't know who to root for in this case

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:28.000
There is a part of me that's like well you know if EA really wants that

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Why does steam need that

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:34.000
But I guess that's part of what steam kind of sells itself on

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Is that all the patching and stuff goes through us

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:40.000
So if your server goes down EA and the game can't patch

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:44.000
We're not dealing on our promise as steam

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
I think that makes sense

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:49.000
It does but I am a little bit torn

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:54.000
I also see where EA says but I shouldn't have to every time we want to roll out a patch or something

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Get permission from steam to do it

02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:01.000
I don't think they need permission but I think that they need to host those files on steam

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:05.000
I think they're just throwing a little hissy fit because they can't make

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:10.000
I don't think they like the fact that steam is taking some of their money for the download content

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
And they want all of it

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Really

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:14.000
I'm sorry go ahead

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:15.000
That's what it sounds like to me

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Really interesting feedback in the chat room and check which way this is tilting so far

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:26.000
Let's see Zether in our chat says they aren't putting Battlefield 3 on steam because of the DLC clause as well

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
Not gonna buy from EA again

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Act F says screw EA

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Kaijuto says Valve you guys are better than EA tell EA to fuck off

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
And Randy says agreed fuck EA

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
And DDR dollar bill says fuck EA

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:45.000
So there's a pretty I mean looking at the fans most people seem to be on team valve

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:48.000
It chatters is anybody team EA?

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:49.000
Curious?

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:54.000
There's a lot of it says or by or um Rama says buy used

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:58.000
Or or I don't think you can buy used PC product really

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:01.000
Or you just go out to the store and buy it

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:05.000
I mean you don't need that digital copy you can just go buy it at a store

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:09.000
There you go or just buy a console version

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Some other things on the whole origin stuff

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:19.000
One other thing I want to mention is about the origin is actually coming to the iPod iPhone and Android

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:23.000
There's a cross-platform Scrabble game coming for free to Android

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Yay

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:27.000
So I mean that to be fair that is something that steam doesn't do

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Steam doesn't deal in the iPad iOS universe right now

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:36.000
There's a part of me though that's like well how does that work because I thought Apple had the exclusive stuff on that

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:39.000
Like I thought you had to do everything through Apple

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:45.000
So how do you launch a new store unless it's like the origin app that has all these mini games that you can buy within it

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Like that has to be what it is

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Yeah

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Right? Interesting

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:54.000
EA did demo the mobile offering the origin Apple let you see your friend list

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Which I'm assuming is across the computer and the phone

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:04.000
The accompanying news feed and sharing what everybody is doing on origin no matter what platform that they're on

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:08.000
There's a new version of need for speed on iOS and it was launched from origin

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:11.000
And origin pushes your friend's leaderboard data into the game

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:16.000
And they said at EA that this was not possible before origin

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:17.000
Hmm

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Well they can say whatever they want but I mean I think you know it's possible

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Look at you know Open Faint

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Yeah but Open Faint isn't really a app it's a enhancement to existing apps

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:40.000
Yeah but they're saying that it's no it wasn't possible to be able to share leaderboard data without EA's you know origin thing

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
But that's bullshit because

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
There's game center

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:49.000
There's game center and there's Open Faint and I'm sure that other people can find ways to do stuff like that

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:54.000
I mean whatever fine PR spin

02:52:54.000 --> 02:53:04.000
Gamer girl in chat says only for sims but otherwise EA stands for eat ass as in EA eats ass

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:08.000
Rama says I liked EA better when they were known as electronic arts

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:11.000
I liked EA better when they were ECA

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
Want to go back in time a little bit

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Check out some of the loading screens on my favorite Commodore 64 games like pinball construction set was an ECA game

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:24.000
Did anybody ever play pinball construction set?

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
That game was fucking rad

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:27.000
No

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:30.000
Anyhow

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:35.000
That's it let's take some calls 1877 game OLR our username on skype is orange lounge radio

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:40.000
The skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight on the show

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:43.000
Or something else that you think we haven't covered yet

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
Skypline is open

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:48.000
While we wait for some calls thanks to the delay Loki have any last minute stories for us

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Yeah sure one of the things that came out this week was kind of cool is they had a mod for Call of Duty modern warfare

02:53:56.000 --> 02:54:02.000
That basically turned it into a version of like battlefront so you can actually go check that out

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:08.000
It's a thing they're calling it star what was the actual I can't remember the hell they called it now

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:17.000
It's like a some Star Wars game I gotta find the damn link now

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:25.000
It looked neat though I mean I basically look like battlefront so whenever that actually makes its way out

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:28.000
But it's finally done you can actually download it for free

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
This is one of the hosted mods

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Yay free

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Exactly

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:39.000
I guess they're selling 8-bit glasses now they kind of look stupid if you ask me

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:42.000
Yeah I saw him too and I was like meh

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:47.000
I see that they have an app remember we were saying that that might happen or something like that but the free to be kicked

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:52.000
It was you know for the people they're playing free to play team fortress 2 that they get kicked

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Yeah that was that and I was saying that's everything that's wrong with gaming culture but yeah

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:00.000
Yeah that kind of sucks

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:05.000
Let's see here if I can find this here ah there we go Galactic Warfare is what it was

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:21.000
And you can find that on the ModDB website

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:30.000
Let's see here yeah moddb.com just search for the Star Wars Galactic Warfare mod for Call of Duty 4

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Looks pretty awesome

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:38.000
Let's see what other stuff we could talk about here

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:43.000
Again Skyplane is open 1877 game OLR username on skype is orange lounge radio we'll give it another couple minutes

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Maybe nobody wants to call tonight then it's fine we've had a long show

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:54.000
Zether in our chat says apparently Sega may not be releasing the second Phantasy Star PSP game or Valkyria Chronicles 3 here

02:55:54.000 --> 02:56:00.000
Yeah I was reading about that second Phantasy Star PSP game but I'm more looking forward to this whole Phantasy Star Online 2

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:03.000
Remember? That's still coming

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
I want to try it out

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:06.000
Me too

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Zether says that's possibly due to piracy causing poor sales

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:18.000
Yeah but there's piracy in other countries as well as just here I think it's just because their games aren't selling well over here versus Japan

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:23.000
Could it also be that you know the PSP is kind of on its way out so you really have to evaluate what you're going to put on the PSP

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:28.000
Yeah they probably don't want to pay to localize it so it makes sense I guess

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:34.000
Xbox Live Indie games creators are expressing their disappointment with the low sales on the service

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:45.000
They say that there's not enough exposure for their games and like for example there was sequence which sold around 2000 copies

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:52.000
And they say that's kind of a flop and he's looking at the PC and mobile platforms for future projects

02:56:52.000 --> 02:57:01.000
It's not financially viable to do a large scale project and not expect with any certainty to make some money on the indie marketplace

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Also they said that Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World both pretty well known games on the marketplaces

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:16.000
Sold 50,000 and 16,000 copies each respectively making them relative hits for indie games

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:22.000
I think that our games could sell a lot better than they did with a better platform, more visibility

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:28.000
And he's testing that by releasing both of them on Steam on July 13th for $3

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:31.000
Hey the phone's finally lighting up let's see who's on the other line

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:34.000
Legend of Zaku here

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:35.000
Hey buddy how you doing?

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:38.000
Nothing much just like relaxing

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:39.000
I miss New York

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:48.000
I miss New York for tomorrow, granted I had like a nasty weekend of just working, yes I had to show up to work on a Saturday

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:53.000
Working on the weekend, well life sucks I've had to work on Saturday too

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:56.000
Yeah I'm gonna need you to come in on Saturday

02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Yeah I think my boss was jokingly referring to that, he did the Bill Lumbergh voice

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:07.000
Oh great, well at least he had a sense of humor about it

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:12.000
Yeah but at least it got done yesterday and at least I'm relaxing today

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:13.000
Nice

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:25.000
So basically, yeah that whole EA Origin thing I kind of like killed any and all motivation for me to actually upgrade my PC

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:32.000
It's like I was betting the barn on Battlefield 3 showing up on Steam but because of this shit

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:44.000
I don't know it's like on one hand I have like almost 4 year old hardware but on the other I have no games that I'm looking forward to to justify it

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:48.000
And I'm not talking about Modern Warfare 3 because that's a non-starter

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:53.000
That game is like I'm not gonna jump on that hype bandwagon, I was banking on Battlefield 3

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:59.000
But if they pull out some bullshit copy protection stuff that's gonna turn me off

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:05.000
It needs to be like Steam where even though there is copy protection it doesn't feel like it

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:09.000
It's oblivious to the user and that's how it should be, it should be non-intrusive

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
Agree, agree

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:16.000
But we don't know how Origin's gonna play out because it used to be known as download manager

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:22.000
And even then they still had plenty of copy protection on the games they sold through that one

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:29.000
That's, you know, one reason I truly think crisis was like completely plagued with it, I wanted to buy crisis

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:30.000
Hold on Zaku, Zaku

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
You're wrong, basically stop me, I don't want that shit

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Zaku, I really think that the reason people are all over Steam doesn't even have to necessarily do with its interface and all of that

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:46.000
I think it's honestly the crazy fucking deals they have on there, I don't think anybody would have given Steam a second look otherwise

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
I think it would have been about as popular as X-Fire

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:56.000
It can be true because they can, like, you know, these past couple of weekends they had their annual summer sale

02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:01.000
So, I mean, yeah, sure, I took advantage of it by getting Call of Duty 4 for 10 bucks

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
Dude, Zaku, hold on, I want to say something

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:06.000
Do you remember X-Fire?

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:12.000
Um, I, faintly, I think I've seen him in certain episodes from time to time

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:15.000
Here's the thing, no, no, it's not a user, it's an actual program

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:21.000
And I think MTV Games bought them, thinking it was going to be the next big thing

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:24.000
Steam blew that program out of the fucking water

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:32.000
Because what they did is they took a lot of the things that X-Fire brought to the table and built a store around it that had killer deals

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:37.000
Okay, yeah, I think I remember, I may have dabbled with this a while ago

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:44.000
But you're right, it's like, yeah, Steam pretty much consolidates everything into one app

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
Into one, like, interface

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:52.000
Like, obviously the friends list and the browser just, like, overlay on top of the game in the background

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:56.000
My point is, Steam didn't really bring anything new to the table

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
It just made it, it's like Apple

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:01.000
Yes, it brought it to the table extremely well

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:05.000
Kind of like a lot of Microsoft products, like the Xbox

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:12.000
Well, it's more like Apple, like, taking something that already exists but marketing it well to the point where they make money

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:16.000
And that's what Steam did, they know how to market something like that

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
Something that gamers would want to go after

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:24.000
My point is that Origin, we don't really know what it's bringing to the table yet

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:29.000
Like, a lot of people, I think, are Team Steam in this, including myself

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:34.000
Because we don't really fully understand why EA wants full control of this

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:41.000
I mean, the way I see it is that, to them, Origin is something that's completely out of place to their norms

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:45.000
Case in point, Steam, it's something that they feel comfortable with

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:50.000
If you throw in Origin, it's something that hasn't been proven, it's not tried and true yet

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:53.000
And it's something that EA is still working on, it's still in its infancy

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:57.000
So it's really, it's the uncertainty that Origin brings to these guys

03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:01.000
To these people that are very, you know, that are hesitant about it

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:04.000
And that's what's causing the rift and backlash

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
You know, in my honest opinion

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:12.000
It's like, I know Battlefield 3 will be an awesome game, but the way that the distribution is like

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:16.000
That plays an integral role in the fact that it can make or break their sales

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:23.000
You don't want somebody downloading a lemon, which is gonna be useless if it's locked down pretty tight

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:26.000
You know, to the point where only pirates will have the best experience

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:32.000
Well, I agree, the thing about Origin is that the first copy protection or whatever type of mistake they make will kill them

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:40.000
And this is the interesting thing about new technologies, is that the first mistake, if they make it early on, will murder them

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
Case in point, Google Buzz

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:46.000
Google Buzz was murdered by what they did with the privacy thing

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:52.000
If they screw up to the point where it makes Steam look, you know, really

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:56.000
It reaffirms that Steam is the only choice, then that's it

03:02:56.000 --> 03:03:03.000
Then EA basically has like a walking dead man right there in Origin

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:11.000
The way that Origin can not only be on par if not maybe outdo Steam

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:16.000
Is try to bring something that hasn't been, you know, first of all they have to

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:25.000
One, make sure that the copy protection is not oblivious and more importantly, not obstructive to the user

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:32.000
The second point is they have to do something unique that differentiates themselves from Steam

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:38.000
Aside from what Steam has already done, I'm pretty certain that they're gonna have all the social aspects

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:41.000
It needs to show me what is worth leaving Steam for

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:48.000
And if they can't produce killer fucking deals that convince me to drop $40 on a bunch of games I'll probably end up only playing once

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
Then I'm not so sure they're gonna come out ahead

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:56.000
They need to have a contingency plan if Origin for some reason fails

03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:00.000
Then they're right back where they were a year ago

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
They'll be fine

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:06.000
I understand, I understand, I'm not talking about right now but more long term

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:09.000
They need to have some sort of contingency plan in place

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:16.000
I'm pretty certain Valve has something in place if, should Steam ever fail and they would have to like, you know, wind down

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:23.000
Because they're gonna see a lot of piss off people where their digital content is not worth jack and they can't hold on to it

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:29.000
Remember, the content is only as good as the service that's keeping it, that's backing it up

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:32.000
That allows you, that enables you to actually play it

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:38.000
Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go but before I let you go, I am getting a request from chat

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:41.000
No

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:48.000
I can counter that with the...

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:51.000
Alright, Zaku, thanks for your call

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000
Alright

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:56.000
Nyan

03:04:56.000 --> 03:05:02.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:07.000
What do you think about EA vs. Steam and all this stuff? Let us know

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:13.000
Meanwhile, do we have more last minute stories or did you burn them all?

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:16.000
I burned them all

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:17.000
Good job, Loki

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:18.000
They burned on a fire

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:19.000
Good job

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:24.000
Alright, so what's this, are we ready to announce what you're working on over there or do you need more time?

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:30.000
Because it did come to my attention that, you know, OLR does try to be on the cutting edge of like a bunch of social eds

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:34.000
But there was one that we've all been using that we're not using at OLR yet

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:38.000
I'll go ahead and tell everybody but I'm still working on the theme

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:41.000
We have a Tumblr now, there will be stuff on it

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
We're hipster

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000
We'll post it with lots of pictures from Reddit

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:50.000
Tumblr is a really easy way to like cross post stuff and a lot of people, it's like it's...

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:51.000
It's the ultimate photo blog

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:57.000
It's MAME central, like when somebody sees something funny, they just posted their Tumblr, no words, no...

03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:01.000
Well, you can post words like quotes and things, just pictures and stuff

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:03.000
And videos, but you can actually use it as a regular blog

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
Yeah, some people will want to follow that

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:06.000
We'll see what happens

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:07.000
Alright, let's go to the phone and take another call

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:10.000
Hey, hey, it's Ronma

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:11.000
Hi, what's up buddy?

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:14.000
Not much, well, I have some interesting news to tell

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:15.000
Oh boy

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
Oh no, you'll like it

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:18.000
Okay

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:21.000
I am getting a Playstation 3

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:24.000
Yes! Why are you getting a Playstation 3?

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:29.000
Because a friend of mine is selling his first gen for 130 bucks

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:30.000
That's a good price

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000
That is a good deal, especially because it's first gen

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:35.000
Wow! That's a low price

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:40.000
Yes, do you really think Sony's gonna pull $325 out of my broke ass?

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:41.000
I don't think so

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:44.000
Yeah, I gotta say, I would buy that too

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:47.000
First gens are better anyways because they have full backwards compatibility

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:51.000
I use mine to the fullest by not playing any Playstation 2 games

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
God, I wish...

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000
You know, I know there's some people that would look at me and go

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:58.000
Why don't you just get a PS2 if you wanna play PS2 games?

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:01.000
But I can't tell you, having owned all the fucking consoles I do

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:06.000
I can't tell you how fucking convenient it is to have multiple in one box

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:12.000
Like, I really wish I lived in a world where the Wii, the 360 and the Playstation 3 were just one fucking console

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:16.000
Like, why can't I have this in life?

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:19.000
So

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:24.000
But you know what the funny thing is? You know what the reason why I'm really getting a PS3?

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:33.000
Because Joe Dave told me that they released the Goonies 25th anniversary edition on Blu-ray only

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:36.000
At that point I was like, yeah, I gotta get a PS3 now

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:37.000
That is pretty awesome

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
My husband says that's inaccurate

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
Oh, it is, it's inaccurate

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:42.000
Wait, what?

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:45.000
Dan? Dan!

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:46.000
Explanation!

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:48.000
Oh, he says it's coming to DVD too

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:51.000
It's also on DVD

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:56.000
Well, the fact that I heard that first, I'm like, well, for me that's not a reason to get a PS3

03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:00.000
I don't know what it is since most of my games are on the 360

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:01.000
My question is this

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
Demon's Souls and LittleBigPlanet

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:04.000
Oh my god, LittleBigPlanet

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:07.000
Yes, Dan is correct, I just double checked on Amazon

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
Both are available

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
You were lied to

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
By a lying liar

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
I'll pistol whip her later

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
Alright

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:18.000
With love

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:21.000
Alright, any other thoughts, Raman, before I let you go?

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:25.000
I want to know what game should I get for my PS3

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000
I want to pick from all three of you

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:30.000
You absolutely need LittleBigPlanet

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
Absolutely the must-have game on PlayStation 3

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
Dark Soccer?

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:38.000
Dance is infamous

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:39.000
Loki?

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000
I would do Resistance

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:44.000
You can probably pick up, they have the Resistance dual pack now

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:48.000
With one and two in there, just pick that up and it's a good time

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:49.000
There you go

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:50.000
Works for me

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:53.000
Alright, well have fun with your PS3 and add me, kay?

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:54.000
I will, dude

03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:55.000
Alright

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:56.000
Alright

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:57.000
Bye

03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:00.000
1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:04.000
I guess we can fit in one more call, one quick little call

03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:08.000
See, it does suck because I do have to still pick up Infamous, or not Infamous, Resistance

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:14.000
I actually have Infamous now, I have the download mark for my PS3 from me, welcome back

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:15.000
And I have number two

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:20.000
Although I'm probably going to sell number two because I don't know if I'll really get into the series

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:23.000
Randy in our chatroom says, quick, back out of the purchase, Raman

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:27.000
Yeah, back out so I can buy it

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:31.000
Although that would be a waste of money because I really do have a PS2 already and all that good stuff

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
Alright, I guess we have time for one more call, let's take this

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
Hi, this is Spaznator

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
Hey Spaznator, what's up buddy?

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:47.000
Well, two things, just in reference to the last call that you just had

03:09:47.000 --> 03:10:00.000
If I were to recommend any games for the PS3, aside from a little bit playing what you already mentioned

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:10.000
I would probably go with the Resistance games, those are pretty good

03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:14.000
I want to say this though real fast, Rama if you have the money just do LittleBigPlanet 2

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:18.000
Because all the old LittleBigPlanet levels you can play in LittleBigPlanet 2

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:22.000
Meaning the created levels online, just so you know

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:31.000
I hate to say it because you guys know I've been a really big supporter of PlayStation 3 and all that

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:38.000
I know, and you're that abused significant other that keeps coming back

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:44.000
I'm practically Sony's red-headed stepchild right now

03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:53.000
Since March of last year I have had three PlayStation 3's get the yellow lighted up

03:10:53.000 --> 03:11:01.000
Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that I got so much money invested in the system

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:05.000
In terms of downloadable games and of course the videos

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:13.000
I've got to ask this though Spaznator, is there anything you think there might be about how you use your PlayStation 3

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:18.000
I have to ask it, that could be contributing, like do you leave it in a poorly ventilated place

03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:24.000
Do you use the thing so much that it just can't handle it, is it on all day

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:27.000
I don't know, I'm trying to think, just what could be your luck

03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:33.000
The only thing I could come up with that could possibly factor into it

03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:43.000
Is that my entire building as a whole is practically hotter than a hemorrhoid on Satan's ass during the summertime

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:49.000
I mean, you know, at least in terms of my particular place

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:59.000
I store my system, normally try to keep it ventilated at least 10 inches on each side

03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:06.000
For ventilation and all that, but during the summertime the building just gets hot

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:10.000
But that can't totally factor into it

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:18.000
Because my system got the yellow lighted up twice last spring

03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:23.000
And my building doesn't even get hot during the spring

03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:26.000
In fact it's practically freezing cold during the spring

03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:30.000
Let me ask this, because this is the question that the chatters are dying to know the answer to

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:38.000
Are you breaking up with Sony, is this it, are you saying Sony, I want to see someone else and her name is Microsoft

03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:46.000
I'm severely tempted to, the only reason I'm intentionally having my system fixed

03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:49.000
Is what I was starting to see a minute ago

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:56.000
Is that I have so much money invested in downloadable games, the DLC and the videos

03:12:56.000 --> 03:13:00.000
I just hate to see myself lose access to that

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:06.000
Stuff that I already bought or got for free up until now

03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:11.000
At least for a tiny baby until if I do get it fixed

03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:20.000
I've been playing my 360 lot along with WoW since I just started WoW like a week or two ago

03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:26.000
But it just killed me that the system just died plus

03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:32.000
Now what little money I have coming soon was already earmarked for something else

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:37.000
And now I have to scrounge up money to get my system fixed

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:44.000
And rearrange my plans and stuff like that, so it's a pain in the watch

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:49.000
Well, keep us posted on what happens in this ongoing saga

03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:54.000
And good luck, maybe see if Rama will sell you that PS3

03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:58.000
I don't know, alright Spaznator, I gotta let you go to wrap up the show, but take care buddy

03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:00.000
Alright, have a good one

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:01.000
Alright, bye bye

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:07.000
Man, we had the sad trombone email and now we have the sad trombone phone call

03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:10.000
Three Playstation 3s get the yellow light of death

03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:12.000
Some guys have all the luck

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:18.000
And yet he didn't say I'm breaking up with Sony, he said you know I just

03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:23.000
I've spent so much on Sony over the years, I still love Sony

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:26.000
Alright, this is the part of the show where we wrap it all up

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:28.000
Thank you guys for calling in tonight, we appreciate it

03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:31.000
If you didn't get through, I'm sorry, but please send us an email with your thoughts

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:37.000
I know you gotta type, but we'll read it next week on the show

03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:41.000
Anyhow, we're gonna wrap it up and call it a week here at Orange Lounge Radio

03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:45.000
But not before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts

03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:50.000
And I also plug real quick that if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio

03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:52.000
All we ask, please help us spread the word

03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:55.000
Tell a couple people you know about the show

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:58.000
We really would appreciate it, you know

03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.000
Word of mouth is all we have

03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:03.000
We don't even get $2500 from this show

03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:07.000
So even though that law wouldn't apply to us, it's still stupid

03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:11.000
So just help us spread the word, that's all we ask

03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:14.000
And we'll try to keep entertaining you

03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:19.000
For all the way through 10 years, come next June

03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight

03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000
Dara Sacra, we'll start with you

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:25.000
We have many themes

03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:27.000
My final thought is

03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:30.000
Long Show means no Pinkberry, frown

03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:32.000
Loki

03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:36.000
I have a headache and I really need to remember to bring Dan Wangan Midnight for the PS3

03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:40.000
That's gonna do it, thank you guys so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio

03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:43.000
Thank you guys in chat, thank you guys on the podcast feed

03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:45.000
And thank you for your support

03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:49.000
We will see you next week to do it all over again, good night

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:53.000
