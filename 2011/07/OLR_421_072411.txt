Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends out there on the internet
and welcome back to another week of the show
where every gamer has a voice
Orange Lounge Radio
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you
to talk about video games and gaming culture
and all of that with my co-host
the one and only Dark Sakura
Jamie Summers
How are you doing?
Wasn't there a video game like that in Japan
that was all about putting your thumbs up
people's butts and things like that?
I'm not even lying, that was actually the premise
Yeah, it was like a boonga boonga or something
Who wants to be a proctologist?
But it was like spanking people stressfully
for something, you could either use your finger
or spank them
I know and I'm stressed out
Dark Sakura, you've been very very naughty
Thank you sir, may I have another?
No
Alright, say hello as well to the one and only
Rob Foster, Loki!
How are you doing, Loki?
You're actually muted, there you go
How are you doing now, Loki?
I'm doing better
We're having mic fail tonight in studio
If I sound different by the way, don't adjust your speakers
It's on our end, I'm on backup mic tonight
He's on helium
Yes, maybe a little bit
No, I think I'm just on the overly sensitive mic
which for my voice is really not good
but that's all we got tonight
Let's switch mics
I have a rant or two in you tonight
and I'm not letting you do that on this mic
You will blow up speakers across America
and beyond
Well what's new in your world, Loki?
Nothing
So Josh is turning one very soon, right?
Yeah, a week from Monday
Your baby is turning one
and the other week you were talking about
your possible party plans you were doing
and I was talking to the wife today
and it sounds like you guys have settled on a theme, correct?
Well yeah, it was always going to be
like the pork party
Oh, I thought at one point you were talking about
the pedo bear party or the...
No, those were just funny ideas we were throwing around
I see, I see
So you are going to do the pork party?
Teach the child at a young age about the wonders of bacon, right?
Of course
Well have fun with that, that'll be a lot of fun
Alright, we're going to have fun with you guys here
live at All Games Radio
www.allgames.com
as we do every week, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific
9 o'clock Eastern
at the Bobby Black Wolf Show
If you want to join us and chat, we are ready to go
in our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com
and we do read comments
from chat throughout the show
For instance, some folks commenting
on Booga Booga, the game we were talking about
a minute ago, Act Def says
that game didn't make it outside of Japan
I wonder why, y'all
But no, like Google it
it was a real game
so it's something else
I had the money and it was cheap enough
I'd import it, it's really expensive
Give that to Josh for his birthday
It'd just be fun to have
just put it in my garage
What the hell's that?
Hey guys, want to come over?
You guys would come over if I said, hey guys
I got Booga Booga in my garage
I'd be like, hell yeah, I'm coming over
I'd be like, I'll be there in 15
It'd just be weird
Hide your cameras
We always like to start off the show
with a little bit of how is your gaming week
So let's go around and talk about the video games
we've been playing this week
DarkSakura, what have you been doing?
I played well
I finally hit my next item level
Congrats, addict, dealer
I played some other games
I played Kid Dracula
again, because I love that game
Going back, kicking it Game Boy
Kid Dracula is an old ass game
Yeah
We actually watched a playthrough
of the NES version
I was playing the Game Boy version
and I have been fighting and fighting with Planet Harriers
to get it to work on MAME
to no avail
It's because it's not done yet
I know, but there's Hikaru, Bios
and all this other stuff I was playing with
and it's not working
So
So some classic gaming in your week
Yeah, lots of classic gaming
and Peggle
Which is destined to become a classic in the future
I think
It's too new
Hopefully EA won't ruin the franchise
I did find out, however, that someone did
bejeweled for the Cliccovision
Oh really? Like a homebrew?
Yeah, bejeweled for the Cliccovision
Does it actually exist on an actual cartridge
or is it, you can't really do that
it's only through emulators
I'm sure, anything that's a ROM
you can put on a cartridge
as long as you have the right, you know
thing to write to it
Dan also found something
this Cliccovision that they were going to be working on
that they
halted production, but someone finished it
and has like a full arcade version
of Donkey Kong
So Dan was playing that day and then he played the homebrew
Donkey Kong 2 on his computer today
So we've been all about the homebrew
I saw an
interesting little cabinet the other day
I was at this pizza joint in town
that had, it wasn't an old
I'll tell you that right off the bat
It was some other type of machine that had a lot
of classic games in it, but the interesting thing about it
is it was Pac-Man
and Donkey Kong and Galaga
and it was kind of like, you don't usually
see Nintendo games participating
in the collections
because Nintendo keeps that
stuff to Nintendo, so it was kind of weird
like where did this, like the Play Choice
Yeah, where did, no it wasn't Play Choice though
it was like actual arcade Pac-Man and Galaga
and stuff, so
Let's talk about the Nintendo ones, oh yeah I remember those
The Nintendo were the Play Choice games, or like the Wii
and stuff now, you don't see a lot of like the retro
It had to have been the homebrew type of
I don't know, it was interesting
though, because I remember
SalaciousPop commenting on it like, those are
games you wouldn't usually see together in a collection
Yeah, but I don't think it's a homebrew
thing, they have
other machines that are very similar to
you know
the
multi-game machines, they have like
packs that you can buy
so it's like okay, here's Atari games, here's
Nintendo, here's
Capcom or whatever
So they've got those out there
It's just I didn't know Nintendo to usually participate
in those, usually it's kind of like they
keep it for their own systems and so forth
Eh, maybe
Alright well let's move on, Loki how was your gaming week?
Same old
stuff, didn't really play a whole ton
of stuff other than basically
Grand Theft Auto and
I think I did play a little
bit of Earth Defense Force in there this
week, mainly Grand Theft
Auto
Just, you know
What do you expect when I play at lunch all the time?
It's basically
what we've been doing
I thought that was going to get replaced with Earth Defense Force
in South Armageddon now that that was out
It does, but here's the thing
My boss usually wants to play during lunch
and you know, it's only so many
players for Earth Defense Force
You don't have a third copy
You know, he just really
puts the peer pressure on
about wanting to get kicked
get his ass kicked
in Grand Theft Auto and so I have to
oblige, you know
Are you going to tell your
boss, no I'm not going to come speak to your ass
at Grand Theft Auto? Thank you for reminding me
Has he ever threatened to fire you over how good
you are at Grand Theft Auto? Yes, lots of times
Almost
every week
I'm always like, you know we have reviews
coming up soon
I'm like, I don't care
No, it was funny
We have these nice
Sony headsets
Like, headphones, I should say, not headsets
Headphones that we use
for the gameplay
We have it hooked up through the stereo connectors
on all the VGA cables
But, you know
As you know, you can't really
talk over a headset
because the headset goes on your head
and it's usually meant for people that have TVs
Really? A headset goes on your head? Yeah, I know
A headset goes on your head
I've been doing it wrong!
You'd have to wear a second pair, like a second set of
headphones on top of it, so it's just
not practical
So what did I do? I thought, hey, you know what?
I got a few of these wired headsets
from Microsoft, I'm going to break them apart
and make them work
And so that's what I did, I snapped the
headpiece off
broke the thing apart, I took out the
actual speaker from the
headphone, and then of course
the only way I could attach it to it is with
plain old
tape
Scotch tape
Not even duct tape
Here's the reason why I did Scotch tape
because these are nice headphones
I don't want to ruin them
I just want it to stay
And it works great, because now we have the nice headphones
and we can talk
you know, for the occasional
person that's from
Mexico, or
Usually it's the UK
We've got people that complain in the UK
and every now and then it's like
gee, I really wish I had a headset so I could
tell them to shut the hell up, because
you know, they'll be like, oh, you have
to use the stickies to kill me, what?
You suck, you just can't, you know
kill me with anything else, so then I proceed to kill
them with every weapon in the game, and then they still
complain, so
So you've gotten in lately
long story short, you've fixed headphones
so that you could smack talk people on
Xbox Live this week. Yes. And what types of things
do you tell them off with? Do you want some
tea and crumpets with your wine? I haven't really
been using it to talk. I originally
gave it to my coworker, Jason
unfortunately we had to take it away from him because
all he kept doing throughout
the first game was going, hello
hello
and we're like, listen
okay, you're not going to talk like a rapist
over the god damn
you know, headset, or taking that damn
thing away from you. No, I gave it to
my other coworker, Rob now, and he
uh, he'll usually do a Julia
child impersonation on the
which is pretty fun. First we're going to get
the cake and kill you with it. It's all
Hello, boobies!
Wait, that sounds like Dame Edna
actually. Hello, my
puppets!
Well unto your death!
I didn't say that his, you know,
impersonations were good, but he'll do like
you know, the French Knight
from, you know... Shall I kill you
with my sticky whip?
But there's some pretty funny ones
like, I love playing with the people in the
UK because I love their
accent, and the kids that we play with on there
you know, I'm going to get
the orange, fella! You know, just like
really proper English is hilarious
to me.
By the way, I didn't think
any British impersonation could be
worse than mine, but yours is really
bad. Well, I was doing an
impersonation when he does. I
can't vouch for his impersonation
of anything, but no,
it's just fun.
Really, this is just a temporary thing
until I get my Saints Row
headset. Now, we do know that
the Saints Row Collector's Edition headset is not
compatible through Live
without some adapters
that I can easily find.
So I will have my auto-tuned
voice. They're selling headsets for Saints Row
that you can't use for Live? Yes, it comes
with the Collector's Edition. It's only meant for
PCs and phones.
Okay. It's because it's got a
3.5 millimeter
connection, whereas most of those things are
2.5. They were too cheap to make a deal with Microsoft?
Yes, they were too cheap, so basically
there's a thing that you can get
that splits
a headset
into the, you know,
both the speaker and the microphone
port, and then there's something in the reverse
that goes to 2.5 millimeters, so
I can get
that stuff, and I can make it
work. I've already figured it out.
I've already bookmarked this stuff on Amazon.
It's all a matter of waiting now.
I'm surprised you don't own one
of those little trash talker things
for Xbox. I know SSG100 Matt's been on
the show before talking about those.
They were using, well, we all were playing
Perfect Dark one night with some of the understation
Live people. He was using one of those frickin'
trash talk devices.
I was gonna do one better on that,
as I was actually going to, and I can do this
once I get that actual
device to connect my auto-tune
headset, is
you hook up a splitter to it, and then you hook it up to your
iPod or iPhone or whatever,
and just pull up a soundboard
and tap away.
But yes, the trash talk's pretty awesome.
It's only four. I mean, sometimes you want
Duke Nukem to see a few other things
other than the four preset stuff.
That's right. Four insults
is very limiting. Exactly.
Repeat yourself a little much. Alright.
And pushing buttons on the headset
and stuff to make Duke Nukem
say things. It's funny, but see, the problem is
because I cut the speaker
off, so I can't hear what it's
actually saying, I can't hear myself talk
over everything.
I can only
hear my coworkers saying,
oh yeah, I heard you.
That's the only way.
So, good luck in your trash talking with
the Brits adventure.
Whatever comes of that.
Let's see, my gaming week.
Actually, not a whole lot of new stuff.
I had a very Jamie week. All I really played
was wow, this week.
I did play a few other things
though. There was a few other things I played.
Like, I went back to the fitness game,
and I gave that another go. Remember I razzed that game
on the show last week, the Urself Fitness,
because it didn't have me stretch beforehand.
Well, this time I stretched,
and what do you know? I made it a lot further
in the opening act. I actually made it
through the entire calibration this time,
and didn't feel like
dying the next day. My legs were a little
sore that night, but it wasn't nearly the
pain and suffering I went through the week before.
Like, I'm actually walking today.
It's a miracle. If you really want to see it.
Why don't you come over to my place? Why do I always have to come over here?
You should come pet the kiddies.
I do want to go to your place, but you've never
given me your address, silly Rob.
Well, my address is...
Oh, wait. I can't say it here.
Alright.
One, two, three, any street.
Anytown, USA.
That's right. Anytown, USA.
Actually, true story, I will give you
I will give you a hint
to where I live. I live not far
from a place called Safetyville, USA.
No shit. There's this little
place, and everybody
you see a sign for it on the freeway, and everybody
drives by going, what the fuck is Safetyville, USA?
It's a place where they
take kids in elementary school
and it's one of those tiny
towns where all the buildings are built
at a kid's height or whatever
so that when they're walking through the town, they're little
Godzillas in the town, but it's where they learn about
safety and look both ways
before you cross the street, or the little plastic cars
will get you, you know, things like that.
But it's adorable to drive by and look at
because it's all these tiny, chibi little buildings.
So I don't know why, but Loki talking about
Anytown, USA, maybe think of Safetyville, USA.
It's like that town in hot fuzz.
I guess.
I haven't seen hot fuzz, so I guess.
There's like a miniature of the main village.
Who's there? Yeah.
I don't see like any movies. I was just talking about this the other day.
I didn't see Captain America.
I didn't see Green Lantern.
I didn't see Green Hornet.
Green Lantern was shit anyway.
Well, but you are clearly a Marvel fan girl.
No. DC fans
have said that Green Lantern
I heard it was terrible. I don't know.
Look. Look.
I know some of y'all don't want to hear it,
but I would gladly pay money to look at
Ryan Reynolds for two hours, okay?
But it's actually not him. It's a CG fake body.
Now when Deadpool comes out...
Imagination's all the same. Alright.
Look. That's not what we're here to talk about.
Other games I played this week. I did check out
the demo for one new title. I don't like
doing game reviews based on
a demo, but I will say it was
a great demo, and it did kind of sell me
on the game, and that was Bastion on Xbox
Live, which is a new game that's out
for their Summer of Arcade.
And I did spend a night the other night
just playing through that. It wasn't too
long. It was probably about 30 minutes to maybe
an hour tops. But kind of
the premise of it is it's very much like an
isometric sort of game.
Made me think of... I don't know why when I first
started playing it, my mind went back
to like Solstice
and Equinox, which is not a
bad thing, okay? I don't know if you know these games.
Solstice was on the Nintendo, and Equinox
was a Sony ImagineSoft game.
Sony logo on the
Super Nintendo. And Equinox
is one of my favorite Super Nintendo
games they ever made. And a lot of that has to do
with the music. But anyway, it's that very isometric
kind of dungeon exploring thing.
And I used to love those games.
And so when I played Bastion
it kind of was that same thing. I was like, oh, this is kind of cool.
But the art style is very different.
The art style reminds me a little more of something like
I don't know, Braid or something. But what I thought was really
neat about it is that the levels kind of appear
as you're walking. Very
interesting. And then of course most of all
the way the story is told is that
there's a narrator in the game
who sounds a lot like this.
He's kind of a little bit of Isaac
Hayes in his voice.
And he's narrating the game.
And he's talking about that the hero
just got up. And so then your character gets
up. And like you're walking down and you
fall, like let's say you're just clumsy and you fall off the
ledge. The hero falls to his
death and it's game over. And then
he'll fall back from the ceiling. Just
kidding. Just like
crazy things like that.
I'm sure that's the first
thing everybody's going to do when they play Bastion
is kind of like, oh my god, that
narrator has got to stop even though they
really enjoy it. So it's
cool. Yes,
I played through the whole demo and I liked
you have different kinds of weapons.
You have a hammer and a crossbow.
Or you have a bow that you charge
like a singular bow.
Or I think there was a magic type
weapon as well. But you can only really carry
three of the four. So you do have to kind of make some
decisions. And I just, I don't know, I thought that was
kind of neat. Just the whole
way it was designed. So I definitely think I will pick up
the full version of that. It does seem to
be like there's, like I noticed right
when I got to the end of the demo in the main
world,
well not the main world, but like I guess
the Bastion square or whatever the central
square is that's supposed to be like the hub
that I guess the rest of the game takes place through.
I noticed that there was a place where I
could put a shop
of one of two types. I could pick
one or the other. So it's kind of
like the choice on what you put there will
affect your game a little later. Unfortunately
the demo doesn't let you kind of fully
realize that out. But
I'll have to tell you more about that when I pick up
the full game. So yeah,
I thought that was kind of rad.
So going to chat.orangelauntrader.com
to see if there's any feedback on the game
here. Zether says Bastion
needs to be on Steam. I think
it was an Ubisoft game. No,
Warner Brothers. It's a Warner Brothers game. It might show up on
Steam. You never know.
Dark Tetsuya is asking, can you do the rest of the
show like that? No I can't.
But maybe I'll do one of the
same. Maybe I'll read an email tonight in that
voice. Dark Soccer can pick an email and I'll do it.
Okay. Alright. I'm just
kidding. I'm not going to do it.
Let's see. Stop trying to
get out of reading emails.
I think that's really it. Otherwise
I've just been playing a lot of the other same stuff
I've been playing. Like Beat Hazard. I tried
to play Survival Mode one night.
I didn't get very far. I got through like a song and a half.
And just playing some other
stuff on Steam. Bit.Trip and some of the other games
I've talked about in previous weeks. Bastion's probably the
only new thing I've played. I have two games
at home sitting for my game rental service
waiting to play.
And I just haven't gotten around to playing them.
And that's Test Drive
2 and
one of the Need for Speed games. I don't even remember
which one. But hopefully
I will have a racing-a-thon in the next few
days and I can talk about those games on next
week's show or something.
I'll tell you what else too
is something I did this week is I went
to the mall because I was just wanting
to get out of the house going to the mall. And
we realized that we had a gift card that we wanted
to spend at GameStop. And
I kind of felt a little dirty going to GameStop
because I have to tell you guys, I am currently
boycotting GameStop. And
you know, I'm not going to tell
anybody else what to do. And I realized
that there are people that might
be employees of GameStop and so forth
that listen to this show and I want you to know the boycott
does not have to do with any
type of like store employee.
But the management of
GameStop is like doing things
to a friend of mine right now that
I really don't agree with. And we're talking
like things of a legal nature
that just like disgust me.
Like the way this person who worked for this
company with so much loyalty for so
many years really I think demonstrated
and somebody who I think
almost in some ways
gave up opportunities elsewhere to go
work for this company.
And just to see the way that they're being
treated now by this company
because of
other situations that happened just
it just disgusts me.
Like I am disgusted by the actions
of GameStop and I can't say too much about
what's going on because there's a whole
legal element to it. Yeah I know
I know but it's just
it's just infuriating and I refused
to give my dollars to a company
that's going to do that to people.
Like it's it's gross
and it's
I don't know I'm not going to support it.
Like I'm not going to support
this company
I don't I don't I don't even know
how far I want to go with this. I got to be careful
what I say but I'm just I'm just I'm boycotting
GameStop. If there are
I would encourage you
but I'm not going to tell you what to do. And I
realize we may have employees that listen to
the show and this is no fault
of like a store employee or anything like that.
Like I realize people have to do
what they have to do especially in this economy to make a living
but I'm just going to say
I hope
sometimes I really hope these rumors
are true that digital distribution may kill GameStop
and that's again no offense
to those of you that work in the retail front.
I hope you all find other jobs somewhere else
very soon. It won't because they bought
a digital distribution company. Well
that will hopefully fail miserably. That's
that's what I hope because the management
and the uppers at GameStop clearly
are just assholes.
I don't have and I have freedom of speech
freedom of press granted to me in the
U.S. Constitution. I can say in my humble
opinion GameStop management is
assholes and I am not going to support
a company run by assholes.
It's as simple as that.
I will now step off my soapbox
la la la la la. But that was something that came
to mind this week. That's actually something that I
wanted to address like two weeks ago. But
I think it was the same week as our ninth anniversary
show so I kind of never got into it. And now
I'm not as ranty pants
as I probably would have been that week.
So but I
I'm feeling like I
needed to touch on that at some point. If you don't ever
hear me talk about that store again now you know why.
Let's see. Unless it's bad news about
them. Well I
I will continue to do my job of
reporting on them in
the most impartial way I possibly
can here on the show.
You know whether the news is good or bad
we'll continue to report on it so you guys can
talk about it. But just don't expect me to be their
cheerleader. You know Dan's been like the recipient
of like three payouts from
class action lawsuits. Really.
Yeah. Really. Well
I hope...
Like a hundred bucks
you know nothing major but
there's been a number of them
and a number still going on.
Act Deft in Chat says was it the
planking thing? I read about
that where the GameStop employees got fired
for doing the planking. Believe it
or not. Now I can't believe
I'm going to say this after my rant. Planking?
Have you heard of this? Is that like that Pilates
move? Do you remember like in the 50's when people
used to sit on flag poles and that's what
was cool? Yeah. Ok what's cool now is to
put pictures on Twitter of yourself
lying dead in the most
strange places like in the middle of traffic
or what these GameStop employees
did. Do a
news.google search on
GameStop planking and a guy is lying
dead between two GameStop
displays like a plank. He was laying on
top of the displays. Yeah he's lying
on top of the displays and I got to
admit like even though I just chewed GameStop
out there that was
a real dumb thing to do is to be in
your GameStop uniform and take
a picture like that. I mean actually
in that case I kind of
think I know why GameStop fired. They do have a corporate image
I think they're allowed to do that
I gotta say. Otherwise
they're assholes. It's like the stewardess
that put pictures of herself you know on
the airplane you know and showing some
cleavage. Or the Disney employees at
Euro Disney that were all in the costumes and
they were doing nasty things backstage
like don't put that shit
on the internet. Like
if you're gonna do it keep it on your phone and
laugh at a party or something. Don't put it on the
internet. That was the dumb thing they did. Keep in mind
my experience with planking has to do with
bodies.
Oh here we go. Act F. See this is why
I love having a live chat because chat will actually
link us to these things live.
So there you go. I'm gonna bring
this up so you can see the picture here
Dark Sakura. This is what
I can't believe. Oh Spaznator
in chat tells me that flagpole sitting was in
the 1920s.
Actually that was
um. I thought it was the 50s.
No. Okay then
swallowing goldfish or
this is actually kind of cool.
Why you like that?
I think that's ridiculous.
Well I mean it is ridiculous but it's kind of
neat you know. That's some good
abdominal control. And as
I've complained about. You are the most
unpredictable woman I've ever met. Okay.
And that is saying a lot because most women are
unpredictable. This is
retarded. I'm sorry
stupid. I've been
told not to say retarded by my wife.
You might have been retarded people.
Well you should cut back on that
quite frankly.
It is incredibly
stupid. I mean this
coning which is the new thing where you
You're offending stupid people. Where you go through
the drive-thru order an ice cream cone and then
you grab the ice cream off the cone.
Who cares? I would just think you're
stupid. Good job
man. Ah you're smart.
Wait tell me that. What is coning?
You get an ice cream cone
and then someone else runs by and takes the ice cream off the cone.
No no no no no. Okay.
Coning is where you go through the drive-thru
of a fast food place
you order an ice cream.
An ice cream cone that comes on a cone.
Instead of like a normal person
grabbing it by the cone and enjoying your ice cream
you're a dumbass and you
grab it by the ice cream.
And you shove it in your face.
And that is coning. Or
yes. This is
what. These are the people
that will be voters someday.
They're not already. Thank you for
ruining the world. I thought
I thought that was called fire in the hole.
That's what people did. And that
like actually was not cool because like
somebody got burned over that whole thing. But like
the fire in the hole is where you go through the drive-thru and you
order like the combo meal and then you yell
fire in the hole and throw the soda
out through the window.
But some some asshole
did it with coffee and like burned
some guy. That is actually not funny.
Well of course it always takes stupider
people to you know ruin everything.
And then there's a new thing called owling.
I would demonstrate owling if
except I don't know if this chair would hold me.
But owling is basically where you
kind of squat down on top
of something like you're a stupid owl.
And you take a picture of it because you know
planking wasn't dumb enough.
So the people have to
come up with even dumber things.
I don't know.
It's just stupid.
The internet makes people
stupid.
We have proof.
So anyway
I didn't mean to get
you're not supposed to
after I do a rant like that on GameStop
you're not supposed to give me a news article where I agree
with one of their crappy management decisions.
They also fired
the person that took the picture.
I
I think it's justified.
I hate to say it but like you know
you're there to work not to do
fucking planking photos. Well I can't make my
fellow employee do his job if he wants
to go lay down on something.
I'm taking the picture to expedite
this whole retarded
stupid thing that he is doing.
Well okay but let me
put it this way. Let me put it this way.
Let's say those employees
leave their position
at GameStop and go
plank somewhere else.
And GameStop threatens to do things to them
because they've done things after the fact.
That's kind of what's going
on in another situation right now and
that's why I think it's just
icky.
So that's all I'm going to say.
I feel better.
Alright let's move on. Let's talk
about well we've done our gaming weeks.
How about some housekeeping? You can always find us on
Twitter. www.Twitter.com
slash o-l-r. Our website of course
OrangeLoungeRadio.com or you can always friend us on
Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio
Let's move on
and talk about some news
and what's going on in the gaming industry this week.
Let's see what else Pizzas' offer makes us happy.
Oh I can't wait to see where we're going to
start tonight. What is
the internet talking about tonight?
Let's talk about a wonderful
wonderful game that was
highly anticipated. Made by
Capcom.
Long awaited sequel to
Mega Man Legends. Mega Man Legends 3
this project that they were also kind of
getting input from the fans
themselves to help them
create this game.
They said you know what?
We're not going to put it up.
Originally they were
going to have
this prototype version that was going to
hit the eShop
and you're going to be able to download it.
Then they started doing this crap like
well not a lot of people download
this game. We're not going to make it.
Now they're like well there's not
enough systems that sold so
we're not going to make it.
Basically the actual
quote
unfortunately it was
not felt that the Mega Man
Legends 3 project met the
required criteria to go into
full productions and thus it was
pulled.
Apparently they're saying there's
a fan campaign going on
now to get people to
put this game out. I have a few
problems with this. One, not to
be rude but that fan campaign will be about as
effective as the mother fan campaign.
Sorry. Number
one, who told
Capcom to fucking put it on 3DS
anyways? I mean that's risky.
You're kind of assuming well it's a Nintendo
system. It's going to sell incredibly well.
What happens if it doesn't?
They're like what do you mean what happens if it doesn't?
It's a Nintendo system. It's going to sell incredibly well.
I mean that's kind of
their logic there. Then when it didn't they're like
crap.
Um
but I don't understand
why they just don't put it out on
our system. I mean god it can't be that
hard to port a Playstation
1 looking game onto
another
system like Xbox Live Arcade,
Playstation Network, WiiWare. Now you've
always been quite the fan of Mega Man Legends
haven't you? Because I remember
earlier episodes of this show and I mean like
early in the first few years of the show where you were talking about
how much you love those games and you always wish they
make a third one. So now here it is
Capcom's going to make a third one and then oh well
you know what actually. And it was one of the reasons
I got a 3DS.
Granted not one of the top reasons I got
a 3DS.
But at this point it'll take any reason to get
you know to justify
getting a 3DS because there's not many reasons
out there. But it's one of the things
it's seriously stupid because
this is one of the games oh yeah we're
the fans wanted this and we're going to
take all this fan support. Then they're like well
we didn't get a lot of support on this so
uh you know
So they're going to give they're going to abort
they're going to have a live abortion of Mega
Man and make all their fans watch. Yeah I love it.
We didn't get enough support on the forums
for this you know
voting processing.
I'm sorry but
you're the fucking game
developer why do you need people to
input on the game? Well we didn't get
enough input on the game so we don't know
what to do. Well what do you do in the situation
where you don't ask the fans what they
want you just I don't know
create the develop if you
will the game. The
crowdsourcing was not up to our expectation
so we fired all the employees
you. It was stupid
it's it's just Capcom
being Capcom now I'm sorry
but Capcom's kind of
I don't know what they're doing. I
think some people higher up are making
really dumb decisions.
Okay so let's go to comments from our chat
chat.org.com. Breakman says
I think Legends 3 was cancelled because they wanted
to shove it in Inafune's face.
Well the
creator of Mega Man left some time ago. Well that's
that's awesome yeah let's shove it in his
face that's
yeah that'll show the fans.
I
I don't see the point.
Do you think there could be legit you know to play
Devil's Advocate here a little bit could there be legitimate
concern on Capcom's part
that there just wouldn't be money to be made off
of this game. That maybe they're going to go through
all the trouble of developing it and the fact
that the 3DS has not quite
sold millions and millions right now
and the fact that you know
Mega Man's Legends is a title
that's many years old maybe it really
wasn't destined to sell that many copies.
So therefore it's not worth doing.
They've done more retarded
things like they put out
was it the Mega Man powered up Mega Man game
on the PSP and
the Mega Man I think there's a Mega Man
X kind of remake thing
on the PSP as well
that I mean the PSP it
didn't have that many people that bought it
and in a game like that especially
where it's just a remake of the first Mega Man
game not a lot of people really cared
about that even though it was kind of cool they had a level
editor and stuff like that it just didn't
really strike me as
something big like
a sequel to
a really cool franchise
that people have been clamoring to get
more of and obviously you know people
love the characters because I mean you have
Tron Bon and
Marvel vs. Capcom 3
and 2 and you know
there's cameos from the
Servbot characters are everywhere
like you know and Dead Rising
and all that stuff and people love
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and Tatsunoko
vs. Capcom I mean
they're definitely around there it's just
I don't know
it's just kind of stupid
there's some games you just put out to make
the fans happy and granted you're not going to make
a lot of money on it but
I'm sorry but when you're
not really marketing this game
you're not really
needing the talent
to come up with all this stuff since you're
having fans kind of create everything
for you I don't
understand why
why you would even have
a big budget for this let me go to the
chatroom and read some comments there's an
interesting perspective here we have GameGuru in our
chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com says
the problem with porting a game like
Mega Man Legends 3 to Xbox Live and PSN
vs. the 3DS is because
Capcom could sell it for $40 on a
physical medium vs. $15
on a digital only medium
TheRobD in our chatroom says reasons
why Capcom probably cancelled Mega Man Legends
3 not many people like
Mega Man Legends 1 and 2
Inafune left 3DS didn't sell
well lack of fan demand
pick any of those reasons all of them are valid
that said with the fan support they were
asking for they should have released the game
who said that they couldn't put it on a physical medium
I mean they could have easily done that
and put it out as a disc sell it for $40
I mean people would have eaten it up
oh yeah especially if they'd released it like
as a budget title quote unquote where it was like
$29.99 or it would have sold like crazy
I think and you could do
download content later on because everyone's
about download content but
Capcom just doesn't get it and I
mean I know we're going to be talking about
some other stuff from Capcom but
let's look at what they're doing I mean
here's their good ideas that they
have coming out there's some
new IPs from them so I'm
not really commenting on those but
the stuff that's existing
like there's a Dead Rising 2
off the record it was basically
Dead Rising 2 the way we should have done it in the first place
because the last one didn't sell very well
I mean that's kind of dumb
and then you have
Ultimate Marvel
versus Capcom 3
it's like well
we were going to offer
download content for the first game
and we charged a buttload for a couple of them
and then we said
fuck you you buy a disc now
so
and then
all the stuff that they're doing on the
IOS marketplace their crappy
DRM I mean there's just a lot
of really bad decisions
and we see this similar
type of trend with other companies I mean
Activision for example
um
they just kind of have to have a reality
check for a little bit oh and let's not
forget to mention Devil May Cry
how they're rebooting that franchise
and just I don't
even know what they're doing to Dante it's just ridiculous
could it maybe be that
it's not so much the news that they've
cancelled the project but it was kind of the way
they delivered the news like
part of me thinks especially seeing in our chat
room that there are some people that are kind of sympathetic
to why Capcom cancelled Mega Man Universe
Mega Man Legends 3
actually there's another comment on Mega Man Universe
don't forget that project was cancelled too
I'll come back to that in a minute
but see that's the point could it be
the way they handled it like you know
Netflix took a lot of crap a couple weeks ago
for the way they handled the news
about the price increase to Netflix service
could maybe Capcom have handled this
a little better
well I mean
they could have done a few
other things like saying well you know what
we're going to explore
other options with putting this game out
the only thing that kind of
rubs me the wrong way about this
news was the whole remember they were supposed
to release a prototype version
that was going to be like a downloadable
demo and gauging the reaction of
that would be if they would release the full game or not
but we never even got the prototype
that strikes me as odd
like that they talked about this whole
well you better buy the prototype if you want the game
essentially is what they're saying without saying it
and now they've just canned the whole
thing they're not even going to let the prototype come out
that strikes me as very
like just
I don't know like at least get the
prototype version out and see what happens
it was probably I'm guessing
some sort of licensing thing maybe with
Inafune maybe it's just
maybe that's why
Mega Man's not in Marvel vs. Capcom
you know 3 or the new Marvel vs. Capcom
3 update
or whatever or
I don't know
I really
when I heard it was cancelled I was like ehhhh
whatever
I wasn't that
I thought it was cool but I wasn't
super psyched I mean it would have been nice to have a
game that I was kind of looking forward to on
the 3DS but I've just kind of come to
accept that the stuff on the 3DS
there's just a lot of the stuff I was looking
forward to and
trust me there's been already 3 games
cancelled on the 3DS including
Mega Man Legends 3 that I was
looking forward to for the 3DS
Saints Row on the 3DS and
DJ Hero on the 3DS all of those
well DJ Hero is not surprising though considering what
went on over there I understand that but these were all
games you know that kind of sold me
on a 3DS other than you know
Kid Icarus looks pretty awesome
I think Nintendo is going to recover a little bit
come Christmas time though and I think some of these
companies might regret it you know
I don't know but we'll see I want to read some other comments
in chat because some of these are really good here
Sj100 Matt in our chat room says
it's all a front since Kiji Inafune
creator of Mega Man left Capcom
they started cancelling Mega Man projects
first Mega Man Universe which was a lot of fun
when I played it at New York Comic Con
Mega Man Legends 3 and the lack of Mega Man
and Marvel vs. Capcom 3
Capcom obviously doesn't want Inafune's image
as a part of them anymore
well you can't say Mega Man
Universe was
or the Mega Man Universe was completely omitted
because Tronbon's a character and Servbots
show up there but I also
I do I will admit I had a similar train of thought
is that this whole stuff had me thinking
as I thought about well gee they cancelled Mega Man
Universe 2 and now they cancel this and I thought
how come we never got a Mega Man
11 like didn't Mega Man
9 obviously did crazy good
Mega Man 10 I think did alright but I think
a lot of people were just like okay
you know jokes jokes getting old now but like
I'm a little worried like does this mean Mega Man
at all is
done for now I mean I realize the creators left
Capcom so that's a very distinct possibility
but it's a big deal we had Katamari games with other creators
being there I mean it's
none of them really were as good as the original
well that's because they didn't try
but you know the whole point is
is it that they can't make any of these games
or they're just not I mean cause
if they're not I don't understand
I mean get over your guy themselves
you know if you're just like well we don't want his
character you know he left us
we left us
so sad I mean get over
yourself Mega Man's an iconic
character I would think I would be challenged to make
the best Mega Man game we've ever made
if you really if you really
want to get at him make
the best Mega Man game that anyone's ever seen
we don't need you anymore
I mean but
but they did they do need him
that's essentially what they're admitting
right?
I guess
alright
let's move on with some more gaming news
I suppose of course you can always join our chat room
chat.orangelaungeradio.com
where a lot of folks
kind of going back and forth on this talking a little bit about
the Twitter and how the announcement
was handled there on Twitter I did not see this
but I guess it was pretty harsh on the Europe
Twitter anyway
yikes
so more gaming news here this is a rumor
that's been confirmed to be true
and it has to do with
Goldeneye Reloaded remember this
we saw a listing for this on Amazon.com
a couple weeks ago and it turns out
it is true the Goldeneye remake
is coming out on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation
3 some screenshots were released
earlier this week
it is interesting because
the game press release
didn't even mention the Nintendo 64
original or last year's
Wii game interesting
but nevertheless the game is coming out
Daniel Craig is still playing
Bond not Pierce Brosnan
Activision says that the game will
run at 60 frames a second it will
support the PlayStation Move sharp shooter
gun controller interesting
so
there you go it's also going to support 16
players online the Wii version only
supported 8 they're saying more maps
weapons characters and game modes
interesting
so what do you guys think is this a game that interests you guys
I passed on the Wii version
but I did play it at E3 and I thought it was okay
it's just my Wii kind of collects dust now
if they release this at the right price
I think I'd be interested
but I just have a bad feeling it's
going to be a $60 title and I just think there'll be
too much other stuff this holiday I'm more
interested in I concur that's
really I think what our issue with that would be
yeah it's going to be really be the price that this
comes out and I'm not
seeing your price here on the list so I guess
we just have to assume it's probably going to be full price
most likely
just hopefully they're smart enough
not to release it like a week before
Modern Warfare 3 comes out
like the last
Bond game release dates
are really crucial in gaming I think
that's something we're kind of coming to learn over the past
couple years I mean come on
Activision get your shit together
you know that you have Modern Warfare 3
coming out the week after you may
think huh you know if we put this game
out a week before we're only going to get
maybe one week of sales because everyone's
going to go oh my god you know
Modern Warfare 3 who gives a shit about
buying this
honestly this is a game this Goldeneye
Reloaded is a game that should be out now
like it should have come out now because
what do we have right now nothing
right now nothing I mean
yes I realize they want to you know get
a lot of the Christmas sales and so forth
but at the same time you got to be real
you either look at why the one on the Wii didn't do
you can't put that out this holiday
because you've got you know let's
let's start with the September
you've got Gears 3 and Resistance 3 coming
out you've got the
following month Battlefield 3 coming out
and then you have Modern Warfare 3
it's just going to get lost
you need to
you know you need to really put that out either in August
or you're going to have to wait until
winter don't worry about
getting it out for holiday because
or put it out in December
because there's nothing in December
nothing
DungeonBuster in our chatroom
at chat.orangehonestgrady.com says
I already played the Wii version no need to play it again
but 16 players
online and new characters and new maps
and HD OMG
sign me up
it would be really hard to ask somebody to pay
60 bucks twice though because you know the Wii version
or excuse me the Wii was probably only about 50 bucks
but at this one's full price it'll be 60 bucks
it's going to be hard to ask somebody to pay
that twice especially for what
was essentially a remake of an old game
I'd rather see an HD remake of
TimeSplitters 2
and why that game?
that game is awesome
even TimeSplitters Future Perfect would be awesome
it was such a great shooter
alright
well let's move on with some more news
Dark Soccer what do you have for us tonight?
well we have some news about
Google Plus actually
they have
they're going to be getting some gaming features
soon it's actually on the help page
according to
a few sources they say
that they're going to do something called
game stream where you can check
for updates on the games that you're playing
and
actually when it was on there
the link to it now is a 404
oh
so
but it said that there are
something is in the source code
that are games get game friends
games get activities and games post
to stream so
hmm
well I mean this isn't
I mean this is kind of a duh
especially if you think about that we had
news before that Google had invested
in Zynga a couple months ago
actually maybe more like six months ago
they'd invested what like a hundred million dollars
in Zynga so
I mean the fact that games are going to
come to Google is a bit of a duh
but you know a it's about how
soon and I think the question that really has
everyone wondering is how
are they going to implement it because this could
really make or break Google plus
a lot of the a lot of folks are really
excited about Google plus right now why
because it's not Facebook and
what Google plus is doing right is that
they're giving people a lot of what
Facebook has been very slow
or very stubborn to give and that is
a decent mobile
app for starters
once
Apple finally approved it
let's see they have given folks the
control total control over well I shouldn't
say total because there's some things about
the privacy they even frustrate me too in the pictures
department but like you have to have
a public profile to keep your account
as of the end of the month
oh really yes actually as of the
27th interesting I posted that on
Google plus oh I missed it but
yeah they said if you're you're in a circle
with people I don't read their stuff I'm kidding
I just missed it it can be
as little as just your name yeah
but you have to have a public profile
I think I well I thought you
just kind of had one by default it's kind of like
Facebook you
have a profile but as long
as you know
you lock everything down nobody sees
anything but your name and your default picture
which doesn't have to be you yeah I think
that's it but I mean but they're saying that for people
who have them fully private then
their Google plus accounts are getting wiped
no they wouldn't
wipe that's what it says well wouldn't you just
change it from private or something that seems
a little ridiculous hold a second I will get it
for you alright yeah share the story because I'm curious about
that so then Google might damn
themselves on all these you know hey we're gonna
do privacy right and then oh
well we're not that seems a little
bit ridiculous to me I don't know here it is
it says
and this is
under the Google plus project
area
public profiles the purpose of Google
profiles is to enable you to manage
your online identity today nearly all
Google profiles are public we believe
that using Google profiles to help people
find and connect with you online is how the product
is best used private profiles
don't allow for this we have decided to require
our what require all profiles to be
public keep in mind that your
full name is the only required information
that will just be displayed in your profile
you'll be able to edit or remove any other information
you don't want to share if you currently
have a private profile but you do not wish to
make your profile public you can delete
your profile or you can simply do nothing all
private profiles will be deleted after July 31st
2011 that doesn't seem any
worse than what Facebook does I mean
because yeah okay so you can have
your name and a picture of your cat
I mean that's that doesn't seem
so terrible to me
but there are people that are getting
kinda well
because it's a step
backwards for Google I think a little
bit in the privacy area where everybody's
been really I think I think it
kinda feels a little bit like a slap
or a step back when everybody's been very
rah rah rah circles are the right thing
to do circles are amazing it's
the whole reason why Google Plus works
circles are this year's squares
yes circles are this year's squares
exactly so as far as
going back to the games implementation though
I think a lot of people are nervous about how are they gonna
implement games because one reason that people
hate Facebook is that they hate
the so and so is growing
bullshit on their farm why don't you come
farm with them and all the
invites one thing and also on
Facebook they have at least didn't do hide
all posts by yeah and Facebook
I will say a lot of that got better
but it took a long time for that to happen
and so the question is how's Google gonna
implement it especially if they have a stake in Zynga
now based off of the stuff that's leaked
out it sounds like a
game play stream will be
a totally separate thing that
you would have to click on to view
just the game post and I think that's
a great way to do it that way
it keeps it out of my main feed where people are
posting cute pictures of their cat and
status updates and it just puts it in
a place where if I feel like playing a game
then I'll click on that stream and see what's
going on but I don't always
believe it or not I don't always feel like playing a game
when I go online
and believe it or not I don't always care what other people are playing
yeah exactly especially
my mother in Farmville
believe it or not everybody that sends me an invite for a game
I deny it
oh and all those people, I wish that
this is one thing I wish Facebook had
to have an option where
send everyone who sends you an
invite a message saying knock it off
and
another interesting comment from BlackWolf
in our chatroom and this is something I have thought
about before so I guess I'll address it now
BlackWolf says Skye one other thing to realize
is that they insist on you using your real
name if you use a pseudonym
i.e. you and me we are at risk of
being suspended from Google Plus
and to get unsuspended you would need to send them a photocopy
of your government issued ID
well here's the thing I think most of the reason
why they're doing that is they're trying to keep the
businesses out of profiles right now
and that you know my name on there isn't
fuck you you know like if my name
was Rob fuck you I think they might have
a problem with that I think the way
I'm doing it on there and the way you're doing it on there
we're kind of okay because we're just
you know we're people that are just trying to protect our
privacy because I think you know
podcasters can be in a very unique situation
sometimes and I've talked about
violations that have happened to my privacy before
and how alarming that can be I don't
want to get into that whole spiel before but it's scary
until you've been there so here's my thing
if Google Plus cancels my account fine I'll
stop using it I'm not going to sign
up under my real name period but my life
will go on without a Google Plus
I won't talk about it on this show
I'll make my friends go to another website
if they want to see my pictures and give another company
the ad dollars or what have you
like I am not required
to use this website I think
it's pretty cool and I'd like to keep
using it but there's just
some things I'm not going to bend on
you know and if they're and what
would infuriate me is if
Lady Gaga gets a profile on Google Plus
that will infuriate me if
Lady Gaga gets to have a profile
and I would get mine removed
because I have to use a fake last name to
protect myself from stalkers
then that would piss me off
because that's a double standard
how come Lady Gaga gets to have a Google Plus
profile and not Stephanie Germanotta
that would piss me off
absolutely it would piss me off or any other
celebrity that doesn't go by their real name which is
most of them
Cher's name isn't Cher you guys
Madonna's name actually I think
Katy Perry isn't even Katy Perry
Katy Perry is not Katy Perry look at actors
like David Tennant couldn't register
under his real name because
there was another actor with that name registered with
the Actors Guild in the
UK the greatest
rock star singer of all fucking
time no
Freddie Mercury was not his real
name either well Ringo Starr wasn't his name
but he had illegally changed so
there you go
I like how someone in chat changed their name
to Rob Fuck You
Dungeon Buster in our chatroom
at chat.org.com says
Rob Fuck You from fucking Austria
you know what I would
like is if you
have to register under your real name but you
can choose a pseudonym
but it has to track that that would be great
that would be great
and Rama in chat says Skye but what if she
legally changes her name to Lady Gaga
she hasn't
she hasn't and you know if you watch interviews
with her which I wouldn't expect that all the listeners
of this show have watched Gaga
interviews but me being a little screaming fanboy
of Gaga I have watched interviews and she
she claims and I believe it
I don't see why not that there really is no difference
between her and Stephanie it's just kind of
who she that's the name that people
know her by which funny enough is kind of
what Rob Roberts has become for me
most people I meet don't realize
I have a different last name but I have
to use a different last name on the radio
to protect the things I do from 8 to 5
Monday through Friday I'm sorry but
I'm not sharing the details of my job
and my life and how I pay my
rent and eat because guess
what this show doesn't do that
nor any podcast that you listen to
unless it's maybe Adam Carolla
podcast will not feed somebody
if someone gives me a job in exchange for
me having to blog about it then I would do
that yeah if you want to pay me
six digits a year to do this
show or you want us to start charging a
subscription fees that we start making six digits
a year off this show which I still wouldn't think would happen
then I'll happily use my
real last name
but that's you know
that's where it's at
alright anyhow I didn't mean this to turn into
like a stalker privacy conversation
but yeah games on Google Plus will you
play games on Google Plus let me
ask that I would I would think if
Google has a hundred million dollars stake
in Zynga I think Zynga has
a hot new game that they're going to have
exclusive on Google Plus and I'm talking like
Farmville 2 will be
like a big land for Google Plus
which is going to make a lot of people eye roll
but if they launch it the right
way it won't piss everybody off
if they if they
make it so that it's not in your face
people will be fine but this could make or
break Google Plus if it's if it's all
over and it's Facebook all over again
people will just go right back to Facebook
because they have their network built up there
because you know with Apple
going with big integration with
Twitter and I'm
assuming at some point maybe like Facebook or something
like that you know the Android
iOS or Android
OS I guess is going
with Google Plus
since it's a Google based
operating system it makes sense
yeah
it has the phrase on here
if you're looking for updates shared from games
check out your game stream
so let's hope it's all
hidden in there that would be great
because I wouldn't mind playing Who Wants to be a Millionaire on Google
that would be kind of fun actually
well the whole reason I stopped playing
a lot of those stuffs and that's actually why I haven't signed up for
Turntable yet is because
Turntable requires you to link through
your Facebook and I don't like
all those apps associated with my Facebook
but the good news is I don't use my real
name on Facebook either I'm like
hey it's alright well see I
use my real name but I also use it as a
networking tool right right and
actually I have it to where the only people
who can find me are people I've invited
so
I don't want to I've seen a lot of people who
signed up for things that I might have been interested in
later on it uses it'll
tag them as a way
to advertise their stuff because the tag will show
up on your friends feed right
and I don't want to be used for something that
they're not paying me for right
I gotta say though I
chose to go ahead and go into Turntable
FM and I gotta say that is a
rad it's way better than Spotify
Turntable FM is awesome
well I also read something about the
legalities that how they're getting away with it
yeah yeah somebody post that to my wall
if you haven't seen Turntable FM
how can I explain Turntable FM real quick
it's basically like you and your friends get to
play DJ and you
can't go in a room by yourself that's an
important thing to know you can but you can't do
anything once a friend signs up and it's you
and a friend you can set a queue of songs
to play and it'll basically go down
the line of up to five DJ's
and play the next song on your playlist
and it sounds so simple
but the great thing about it
this is me signing up for it are you really doing it?
sure why not after that whole thing
you just said? well yeah
liar no I'm not a liar but
that's why I'm not doing the games
no I know you can always and you can always go
revoke its permissions at any time that's the other thing
which I spent like an hour doing
because the stupid quizzes count as apps
oh yeah oh yeah so no one's in
right now so you would be going into random rooms
but like if any of your friends were DJ'ing their little
pictures would show up on the right hand side
and you go into rooms and it just goes down the line
and up to five people just it goes
in their playlist and it sounds so simple
ooh they're playing Fuel I'm going to the 90's
mix it's an awesome way to discover new music
it is an awesome way to discover new music
like me and a couple of my wow guildies
were in there the other night just playing
random music that we like and it was
it was cool I just hey have you guys
heard this song? and it comes up next
and yeah the legalities highly questionable
this website probably won't be around in a year
but I'm going to enjoy it while I can
there you go
alright uh let's
move on god we keep bringing up stories
and then it like just turns into something else completely
there it's on there and everyone has to
put up with my music
orange tangent radio you know what
after the show everyone in my room
you should name your room
pillow fight dark soccer is pillow fight
well but the thing is dark soccer you'd have to
you can't the way
that's set up and the way they do that legality
you can't
be the sole DJ
you have to be DJing with at least one
other person well I did make a room called dark soccer
is pillow fight alright so go on turntable
FM right now and look for it I'm not going to post any music
yet oh yeah I was going to say don't play music right now
we're trying to do a show but I've got the room made
alright
um okay so let's talk
Sony here I guess the next
uh what is going to be
the next big thing from Sony obviously right now their
big push is 3D and
maybe it's going to be the next evolution of 3D
right now apparently according to
um an interview with develop
uh magazine
uh Sony London Studios chief
Mick Hawking is
talking about some head mounted
3D displays that they've been showing off
at CES and
uh they're saying that we're working with a couple games at
Sony that are experimenting with
virtual reality type experiences
and uh
basically saying that VR could make
a comeback and definitely
you know I think
yeah maybe a little bit
it could because
you know remember back in the day
graphics on PC's not
that great I mean if anyone's seen
lawnmower man ewwww
that's pretty basic stuff I saw it in the theater
some of those virtual reality demos
back in like 95 and stuff were
hilarious I distinctly remember
one to this day where you could
either be a dude walking down the street
or like in the car and it was
like virtual reality you could walk
up to these homes that were just giant blocks
like but it was awesome the whole
thing looked like um hard driving
yeah it seriously
was that basic and nowadays
I mean you know and who knows when this
kind of technology will be coming out
just technology keeps getting way
better and better each year just exponentially
and I mean very well
in 10 years we could be seeing some sort of
3D virtual
reality technology being the kind of
standard for gaming and stuff
it's definitely within the realm
of possibility I suppose
and I could definitely see Sony kind of
this could definitely certainly maybe
happen it's definitely
possible it is a
distinct absolute
possibility
there is a chance
out there that something like this may
or may not happen
ah
nice
alright
so
moving on I guess I don't know
what Sony virtual reality stuff could they
really make that would be that awesome
well they could
really
enhance home
okay with some virtual reality technology
too I don't know allow more members in your
clubs
alright
I'm trying to
I'm thinking back to there was a peripheral
back in the Super Nintendo
days that were just basically goggles
you could put on your face that were just
televisions literally right in front of your face
and they called it a virtual reality headset
for games like on the Super Nintendo
you know Faceball 2000
I played at one time
a virtual we played a couple of virtual
reality games well it wasn't even
really virtual reality it was basically yes
monitor on my eyes type
thing but
it was at Santa Cruz on the
beach boardwalk they had a thing
that you could do and you could either play Quake
or Duke Nukem 3D
man
awesome it was pretty awesome
alright moving
there's go ahead
I hate getting on all these tangents there's
something that they have at the boardwalk it's called being on
Orange Long's Radio I know I know there's something that they
have on the boardwalk now it's called
like Safe Crackers not
not Safe Cracker it's like
some sort of like heist game
where you have to you go in a room
and you have to dodge lasers kind of like
you know so you're Catherine Zeta Jones
yes exactly basically
you're doing that and
it's a game or you're that scene out of
Resident Evil
yeah it's very similar to that
but it's a game that you play
at the Santa Cruz I thought that was kind of cool
because I hadn't seen that before
my friend posted it on her Facebook
that's at the beach boardwalk
we need to do an OLR from the Santa Cruz
boardwalk I think that would be fun
we need to go Dark Sakura
don't you want to be like Catherine Zeta Jones and be in the
the laser like making sure
that the lasers don't hit your boobies
I'll go look at it
real quick and figure out what that was called
I'm sorry the moment you said her name I started thinking of
Dawn French impersonating her
really I think of T-Mobile commercials
have you ever seen
the French Insolence Show?
yes because you've played it for me like a million times
yes
Catherine Zeta Spartacus Douglas Jones
anyhow
no he's not my grandfather he's my husband
anyhow yes we need to do a Santa Cruz
boardwalk show that would be a lot of fun
anyhow moving on
talking about the Wii U
yes it seems like there's new Wii U news every week
and it's somebody reacting to it
this week it's Ubisoft is reacting to the Wii U
they must like it because it's
the whole console has a capital U just like their company
well they said
Yves Guillemot
who is the Ubisoft CEO says
we feel this
console is coming with very innovative features
that will change the video game industry
and we want to be a part of that
I love that you have a screen very close to you
you can get information and send it as well
but you don't have to learn
too many things
I think it's sending the message that the new transition
is going to happen and we're going to have new machines
coming soon
that almost seems like a bad
translation to me
you get information and send it but you don't have to learn
too many things
well anyhow
speaking of Ubisoft there's been some
clarification if you will on Assassin's Creed
it is not a port
of Revelations
the game that is coming to the Wii U is an all new
Assassin's Creed title
it was part of the little Nintendo announcement
they showed a clip of Assassin's Creed
but it's actually going to be an all
new title
that was clarified in the interview
so it's something new
who knows
could be Assassin's Creed 3
we'll see
but you'll have that
screen and you might be able to
keep some information secret
ok
sorry to go back to what I was
talking about before
it's a game called The Vault
and they have
a little bit of gameplay
that they're showing that's on TV
in the lobby or whatever but you have to
have these lights shining through and you have to dodge them
and they get to where the vault is in the back
it looks like fun
and they play, you can't hear it
but they have the Mission Impossible music playing
that actually looks kind of rad
I'm not even going to lie, I kind of want to play that
but my fat ass would hit so many lasers
your gigantic
ass just set off five lasers
congratulations
moving on, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us
before we get to release dates after this
well how about the
roster for Marvel vs. Capcom
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3
how's that sound?
it got leaked and Capcom's not denying it
so for Capcom we have Strider Here You
Firebrand, Vergil
Frank West, Phoenix Wright and Nemesis
OBJECTION
STARS
actually that is going to be reason alone
Firebrand, to get the game and that's pretty awesome
that Strider is coming back
Firebrand, that's awesome
that was also a bad guy in Ghost of the Goblins
but he had his own two series of games
that's right, what about Marvel
Marvel we have Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange
Nova, Rocket Raccoon
Hawkeye, yes
and Iron Fist, yes
two of my favorite characters on the Marvel side
I'm happy and my favorite character
on the Capcom side, I'm happy
cause
well you know back in the day, Dan had
a website
called Neo Strider Strider Zone
he had
like old style like
Geo Cities type old web page
and I did all the graphics for it back in the day
oh wow, when we first got together
and
so
we actually
he totally got me into the Strider games
but now I'm a big fan
of the
mostly A list but not quite A list
the pushing B plus list
of Marvel heroes
so like my favorite character of all time is Jessica Jones
which I know she's not gonna end up in a game but
I can dream, but now I finally
get Hawkeye in a game
that isn't Captain America and the Avengers
and Iron Fist
who, Iron Fist in a fighting game just makes
sense, awesome
what do you think though about
the whole fact that they're putting out this ultimate
Marvel vs Capcom 3 like not even
a year after the first game came out I mean
isn't that kinda
the game needed tweaking, it needed tweaking
it needed free tweaking
you know what I mean?
like it just, I mean
you have to admit, this is why
people are pissed at Capcom right now about the whole
Mega Man Legends 3 thing is that you know you get
this slap in the face and then you get this slap
in the face, I don't care I don't think it's a slap in the face
I'm excited, it's a slap in the face if
you bought the original, I did buy the original and I
don't care I want this one too, really?
yeah, I mean I don't know, Hawkeye
I will say this, I bought Street Fighter 4
on Xbox 360 and then Super Street Fighter 4
is announced I'm like
alright well I'll get it on Playstation 3 cause at least
I know it'll have a better controller
and then, yeah and then the
arcade edition comes out so like another 15 bucks
but at least that wasn't like a
like a full, I mean I know it was a
full retail release but at least
it was compatible with Super Street Fighter
well they had, they had a DLC that
you could get that basically made it
to where, tournament stick, yeah
it was, worth the money
they should have done that type of stuff with
Marvel vs Capcom 3 except
they decided hey you know we're gonna be assholes
and we're gonna put out each character for $5 each
um
no, well they only had two of them
this is actually, none of the
other characters are gonna be available as DLC
they've got Shumagrath and Jill included with
this one and then all of the rest of the characters
that I named
I think I saw something come out of
Comic Con about other
downloadable characters for the game though
they have costumes
alternate costumes
I thought there were other characters that showed up at the
Comic Con that were like download
content or something like that, could be wrong
well they've also added a spectator mode
and other new playable content
so basically they said
and this is a quote here from
Nitsuma said that
there's about half and half between the original
download content, the planned download content
and the new content
so basically it's like you're getting
well
I would look at it as
almost a new game
like half a new game
with everything else that's going
into it and honestly that's how I'm looking at it
I mean you're getting as many new characters
as a new fighting game
so I guess that's true
at least it's down to 40 bucks too
so those of us who didn't buy the game the first time
like me, now have a reason to
I look at it like a sort of Rock Band 3
you know
your old characters carry over
and you get some new ones, and new content
new modes
with Rock Band 3, all your
songs carry over, and you get
symbols, and new modes, and
harmony, and most importantly the keyboards
and keyboard, you get keyboard cap
yeah but I wouldn't exactly say it's
very similar to that because
why not it's exactly the same
why not because the original game is broken
they have issues that they need to fix
for the online multiplayer, and they're just like
eh, we don't want to do that, we're just going to release a new game
Rock Band's got issues online
ok, but nothing to the point
that it's game breaking
I mean, it's just
I don't play online so I don't give a shit
they refuse to fix it, so they're just like
oh hey, but by the way, you should buy our new game
which very well can have problems of its own
fix it because they're going to release ultimate
I don't play online, so I honestly personally
I don't give a shit about the online play
well you may not give a shit, but there's a lot of people who do play online
and that's a big thing for them, and they do give a shit
then it's their problem
I have no problem with it
I believe it's gaffcom's problem
just a quick note for the live listeners only
I don't know what happened, but Winamp crashed
so unfortunately you missed that little argument
so you'll have to tune into the podcast to hear that
Loki and Dark Soccer just got in a little heated
discussion about that
Loki was having an uncharacteristic
caring for other people
and I didn't give a shit
it's not uncharacteristic for me
I care about other people
me, myself, and I
no, I'm just saying
the whole reason I understand
expanding and adding new features
I think the last game I played online was Fable 2
on Xbox Live
ok, well then this stuff doesn't bother you
that's fine
but for people that do play online
and I guess I don't play this game online
but I empathize with those that do
they may be a little bit pissed at the fact that
instead of patching the game
to make it work like it's supposed to
I'm sure there's going to be a patch
no, there will not be a patch
if they're going to announce a new game
why would they fix the old game
I agree, the old game is done
now that they've announced this
there's nothing going to come of the old game
and back to this, it's not Capcom's fucking problem
people are going to pay for the game
they're going to sell it
because people love Marvel vs. Capcom 3
and I love Hawkeye
so I'm getting the game
I have to say your Rock Band comparison
makes a lot of sense
I still don't know
if I would really be happy that it's all happening
in the same year
but that was probably the best
argument I've heard for Capcom
I can get why people are
messed up over it
but at the same time
they're going to make their money
it's not Capcom's problem
it's the consumer's problem
and the only way it's going to be made
is if the consumer does not follow through
you're right, this isn't Capcom's problem
it wasn't Activision's problem
that DJ Hero 1 didn't have any download content
because they decided
instead of supporting it with download content
like we said we were
we're just going to, I don't know, put out a new game
so Loki, there were like 9 songs
you could download for DJ Hero 1
so, I mean, that was
9 pieces of download content
that you could get
or Konami and Dance Dance Revolution
you know, oh yeah
we're going to support this game
I know we said we're going to support the last game
with download content, but I promise you
we're going to support this game with download content
and here's your
one piece of download content
you know, it's just like that
and you may remember what happened
to Guitar Hero where there wasn't as much
download content, but hey, you know what, we released
these song packs, because that's what the fans
want, they want all their characters
and all this cool spectator mode
and alternate stuff, because you know what
I really need an Elvis costume
for my fucking characters
that's really canon for
Marvel, that's going to be really awesome
so
looking forward to it
oh, and by the way
not to nitpick here a little bit
Capcom, but
your game, Street Fighter
versus Tekken, or Street Fighter
across Tekken, I know that you've added
other Capcom characters, they're not
part of Street Fighter, you need to change the fucking title
hey hey hey, I'm not to that story yet, you need to wait
you just sit and hold that rant
alright, we gotta go to some release dates
travel around the world
and talk about what's coming out to a store near you
Loki, start here in the US
there's not much of anything coming out this week
it's pretty much
Catherine
that's on PlayStation 3 and
Xbox 360, and of course
they have the Love Is
Something
some collector's edition that
Love Is Something
how about Love Is Over?
yeah, Love Is Over
you can get that collector's edition that comes with
boxers and a t-shirt
that's pretty awesome
and then of course Pac-Man and Galaga
legions
how would they know what size boxers to put in there
there's only large
some Catherine fans are skinny, some are not so skinny
well, it's just large
the one size fits all
well better, you know, some people are larger
than large, so
you just have to
you just have to hang them on the wall
if you can't fit into them
fair enough
make your cat wear them
yes, Pac-Man and Galaga dimensions
so that's for the 3DS
uh
and the Sims 3 Town Life
stuff expansion is going to be coming out on
PC
that's literally
it, I mean, it's
that dead
well then let's go to the
Xbox 360 in Japan and talk about what's coming
out there, on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week
Operation Flashpoint
Red River comes out this week as well as Dungeon
Siege 3 gets its Japanese
release this week, that's it on the 360
uh, those two games of course
on the 28th, going to the Playstation 3
Dungeon Siege 3 there as well
Operation Flashpoint there as well
and a game called Fit in 6
Karada o Kichiro
6u no Yosu
comes out this week, which I believe is just
some type of like, like, Playstation
Move XR Fitness game, that I guess
is a little more tailored
I don't know if this is a game we have here, it's by
Ubisoft, so I would
Fit in 6, yeah, I came out back in March
oh, we have this here?
shows how much attention I've been paying
to the PlayStation, which I still don't own
I only know because I set
these items up, so
alright, then there you go
going to, I wanna see if there's anything on the handhelds
real quick, or maybe anything in Nintendo's world
the Sony PSP
has
Queensgate Spiral Chaos
comes out this week in regular and limited
or I guess like a special edition
Queensgate is a RPG
become the queen of a dimension
harness the power of the queens gate
the door that connects to all game worlds
is taken over by someone evil and
ambitious, this game includes
Mai from King of Fighters
and the ladies from Queensblade
so this is kinda like a world's
collide type of game, where there's
other chicks from other series
and it looks like a farting maid
that's what that looks like to me in that picture
doesn't look like she's going poot
and it says hip, look at that
who farts with the sound hip
hip!
cause she's swinging her hip, she's going poot
with her hip, could be one of those loud
wine poops, you know
okay, that's plenty enough
hey, I just made it with my mouth
Fit and Six also coming out on the Wii in Japan
if you care, on the 3DS
Super Pokemon Scramble, I remember
mentioning that last week, finally a Pokemon game
on the 3DS, even though it's not, you know,
the Pokemon game, it's
Pokemon Dynasty Warriors
and lastly
on the Nintendo DS, Devil Survivor 2
from Atlus this week
on the regular DS, non-3D flavor
alright, how about the UK?
we have a few things
we have on the 26th, Call of Juarez
the Cartel for PC
and Dragon Age 2 Legacy
for PS3, PC
Xbox 360
and on the 27th, Project Dust
from Ubisoft on Xbox 360
that's about it
a couple more news stories for you guys
and then the classic game of the week, but first
but first, uh
there was a person that had
the domain for modernwarfare3.com
um
they were
somewhat anonymous via
GoDaddy's domains by proxy
hiding surface
we use that by the way
for our own website
apparently a domain dispute
from Modern Warfare 3's publisher
Activision
has dissolved that shield
it is now apparently
known that it is owned by
a guy from Florida named Anthony
Abram and
he is now
doing a bunch of random things with the website
including, he was at one
time redirecting it to Battlefield 3's
main site and also
spoofing
Modern Warfare 3's official
site and um
you know, making videos
that are saying that Modern Warfare 3 is
crap and blah blah blah
the publisher of course Activision believes
that Abram has
no right or legitimate
interest in the domain name and
argues that it's entitled to control
given its history with the Modern Warfare
IP. Yeah I love how that's
granted that this guy, yeah he is
a troll and he is
the domain name because he knows that
Activision is going to have a Modern Warfare 3
game at some point. That being
said, I still think he should have the website
and just because
Activision has a game
for example if I
register a website that's like
I don't know
awesomesauce.com
or something like that and let's just assume
that there's no such thing as awesomesauce
some person out there decides
hey you know what,
Heinz57 is going to come out with
awesomesauce and we want
that domain. You give it to
us because we want it.
I don't think that because you want something
in your company that you should get that.
I mean
I think that you should have registered
that domain a long time ago then.
Because you know, Activision
I don't know what to tell you but
back when you were doing Modern Warfare 2
I could have told you that there was going to be a Modern Warfare 3
and I mean
that's just dumb.
He should have done the
smarter thing and he should have had
some type of club or something
that was like the name Modern Warfare
or something if he wanted to be smarter about it.
Like for instance, I remember this
reading about this, the guy who owns
or at least did own, I don't know if he still
does, I haven't checked it in years but
sting.com, the musician
Sting tried to sue the guy who owns it
because he wanted the domain because he is
the celebrity Sting. He is
you know, he knows that name.
But the guy who owned the domain
wasn't trying to troll Sting. He wasn't
holding the domain for Sting asking for
hundreds of dollars. He was some type of
he was either a gamer or something
where like that was his handle. And that's what he was
known as in the online community. He was Sting
for whatever reason. Like he just had
nothing to do with the musician. What if he had been the wrestler
Sting? Perhaps he was, I don't know.
Well the internet foundation
or whatever actually found in favor of the guy
that he had every right to the
name that if Sting wanted it he should have got it first.
And you know, and I think to
the argument of this guy, Modern Warfare 3
that's not the title
of the game. That's the subtitle of the game.
It's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
You know, it's not like Hello Kitty
Modern Warfare 3. It's
Call of Duty. That is, you know
if he had his website was
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3
yeah I think there's a problem there because
now you're infringing on, you know, the intellectual
properties of Activision.
But this is just trolling. It's just like
whitehouse.com. It's a porn site.
Or it was a porn site.
You know, too fucking bad.
If the White House
can't get a god damn URL
then Activision should
not get a god damn URL.
But if the guy was just
trolling and has no legitimate purpose
to have that title.
Just like these people, like
some person sat on JuliaRoberts.com
and tried to basically
sell it back to her for like
$10,000. That's just
that's just embezzlement. But he's not doing that.
He's just being an asshole. Or not embezzlement.
And you know what? He has the right to be an asshole
on the internet. And you know what?
I don't think he does.
I think in this case. If he has no
legitimate purpose for holding that website
I don't think he
I'm just saying he wasn't smart about how he
used it. He should have used it. If he wanted
to he could have had a dissertation about
how Modern Warfare 3 is going to be a
terrible game or how to be a review on
Modern Warfare 3 and I think he would have had more
of a say. I don't know.
It just, you know, I think
if you're not going to use it for anything
worthwhile, there's that
committee that'll say, you bring nothing good
to the internet. We're shutting you down.
SSJ100Matt fuck you in the chat. Yes
he changed his name to that. Says, I'm
going to register OrangelaungeRadio2.com.
Well, okay.
Here's what
Modern Warfare 2's official website
ModernWarfare2.InfinityWar.com
Oh, well I guess
I can't use that anymore.
Oh, damn.
But I mean, they have a CallOfDuty.com
They can easily do a CallOfDuty
slash ModernWarfare3 or
they can do Mw3 since that's how
it's displayed on the box. I mean
there's plenty of
things out there. What if
What's on that website right now if you try to
go to it? What if he went to Modern
if he did ModernWarfare3.net
or something like that? Is that going to still
be an issue? I'm going to the website right now. If this
auto plays anything. Oh no, it's just
a totally blank page.
No source code or nothing.
There you go.
Thank you. Sturlock
rescue me. Extorting. Why couldn't I think of
that word? Extorting money out of her.
That's what they were trying to do to Julia Roberts. Thank you.
Minute and a half later. Thank you buffer.
If your Activision just
like seriously, who cares?
I mean look at like the ModernWarfare2.com
was a website
and you know it's a ModernWarfare2
fan site or something.
I mean if like if I came out
what if I go and register
ModernWarfare4.com
What are they going to do?
But
I'm going to put some stupid articles about Modern
Warfare like you know hey there's guns.
You should go register
MegaManLegends3.com right now since you
know no one else is going to use it now.
Do they
is there a MegaManLegends3.com
hold on.
Sorry for the dead air but I have to check.
Oh no somebody's
holding it. It's a troll holding
it saying this website's for sale by
owner and it's just a bunch of links.
That's been going on though since
the early dot com
business days too. Oh yeah.
There's nothing new. Those guys
need to be tossed out immediately.
Like if I show that I have a legitimate business
purpose for those guys
need to get tossed. And here's ModernWarfare4.com
with a clown on it.
It says welcome to ModernWarfare4.
website. It would appear that Infinity Ward
forgot to purchase this domain. No worries
we have good
of course they have no spelling.
We have good care of it.
Is this an extortion plot too?
Are we breaking the
story here that there is
this whole time there's been a ModernWarfare4.com
You've all been
focused on ModernWarfare3 all
week? Well there's a ModernWarfare4
out there. There's not a five
I'm gonna register five.
ModernWarfare5 that's mine.
Go get it quick.
Use a GoDaddy
registration code to do that. Oh wait
we're not sponsored by GoDaddy.
That would be hilarious.
Go ahead.
Take the domain.
Could
someone register would somebody be willing to spend
the twenty bucks to register ModernWarfare5.com
It's not even twenty bucks it's ten. Ten dollars.
Really? Ten dollars. What would we point
it to if we bought ModernWarfare5.com
right now? What would we point it to? The
Ooga Booga site. No.
We can make some really
fake looking box art or something.
Nerf fan site.
Modern Warfare with Nerf.
It's Nerf and Nerf.
Would you be willing to post for pictures
modeling with the Nerf bats and so forth?
No. You haven't seen Dan's bucket
of Nerf. And that could be our
little, see we shouldn't say this on the
podcast though cause now somebody's registering it right
now as we speak. But what it could be
I'm cool with you doing that as long as you
give it to us cause what we need to do
we need to have our Nerf club called the
Modern Warfare club and it's just us clubbing
each other with Nerf bats and stuff.
Well I've actually got not just
the Nerf sword, the broadsword
I have the axe and the mace.
And we have a bunch of Nerf guns.
A lot of Nerf guns.
And the orange bat.
Nice.
What about StreetFighter5.com?
No.
No because Capcom won't have that out for another ten years.
Ah see ActDeft I love
that thought. ActDeft says redirect
it to President Cat.
A plus.
Send it to the Renowee Twitter.
Why not?
I like that.
That's actually a really good idea. I like that.
Easm said it should go to the
NRA. Let's put it this way.
If Professor Genki is so popular
in Saints Row 3 President Cat should
easily be able to come out over here.
Alright but just
a footnote and word of warning.
If you register Modern Warfare 5 and give it to us
to put our pictures of Nerf fights on
if you get sued that's on you.
Like I disavow every knowledge
that this conversation ever happened.
SSJ100MattFuckYou says
Rob we really should register a Dance Dance Revolution
site and see if Konami gives a shit.
Wouldn't mind trolling them.
Here's a better one. What if you did it as
COD Modern Warfare 5
and you're fighting with CODs
like fish.
Like actual trout
snapping IRL.
Like M-I-R-C.
It could just be pictures. Sky slaps
Dark Sakura with a trout and it would
be actually me slapping her with a trout.
That would be hilarious.
That would not be hilarious.
That would be smelly.
Alright moving on. Speaking of smelly
no I got nothing. We got
actually this might be kind of smelly. You know the character
Poison from Fatal
or excuse me Final Fight. You mean the
transgender? Is she
really? Yes.
Is this transgender? Yes it actually
is officially said on
like way back in an old
interview with one of the game designers.
It was supposed to be because
they couldn't make her a woman in the game
because it wasn't right to hit a woman
so that's why they made her
a man.
And then they changed the character sprite
in the US. And I think in other
places they gave her a longer skirt and covered
up her boob. But yeah
officially Poison is
supposed to be transgendered.
Well guess what? You're going to kick some tranny ass
in Street Fighter versus
Tekken or you can kick ass as
a tranny. It's equal opportunity.
It is available there.
It's going to be Poison is one
of the characters there as well as
what else was announced here?
Dalsim and then from Tekken
Steve Fox and Yoshimitsu.
Dude Steve Fox was kind of fun. All announced as
characters. I wonder if Poison would whip out her dick
and smack people.
Special attack surprise!
I'm all for a diverse character line up in the game
but here's the thing.
Is that if it's Street Fighter cross Tekken
she's a Final Fight character
and okay I get it like Guy
Cody they kind of crossed over too
but does that mean everybody
from Final Fight is now part of the Street Fighter
canon? Then why can't Poison be
in Ultimate Marvel
versus Capcom 3?
Maybe a download character.
I don't know. It just
seems like a strange pick
to me with so many characters in the Street Fighter
universe but okay. They want to
bring back or maybe they just
somebody really wants to put. It's because they're super
Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom 3.
See you know what sucks is now I have
that song running through my head.
That Bill Biv DeVoe song.
Good lord.
Alright.
Moving on.
Yeah that was at a panel by the way at Comic Con
2011 where it was announced that those
characters would be in the game
and I guess
Hugo, Cody, and Guy
have also been teased for the game.
Well that would make sense if
Poison's in it that Guy and Cody are going to show up at some point
as well. Gosh I wonder how many characters
this game is supposed to have.
It's crazy.
So there you go. All characters
that are set to come out in Street Fighter cross
Tekken which is a game that I'm
pretty excited about actually.
It should be like Andori
who was actually based off of Andre the Giant.
Oh yeah?
But they changed his name because of the state.
Oh right. I remember
those characters that look just like
Andre the Giant.
Funny.
Alright. Let's move on to the
classic game of the week.
Yay. Every week
here on Orange Launch Radio we like to take a
trip down memory lane. Where's my theme music?
Have I lost the theme music?
This is
a big deal.
Where's the theme music?
There we go.
Yay. This is going to be a very bad
mood if I couldn't hear this happy music. Anyway
the classic game of the week is a chance for us to walk
down memory lane and check out
a game that Dark Soccer
thinks hey you kids should be playing this game
right now. Good luck finding one.
Well
regardless here it is your classic game of the week.
The classic game
of the week is Planet Harriers
which I brought up
at the beginning of the show and I've
brought up constantly throughout past shows
I'm finally reviewing it because dammit
this game is awesome.
But it is
part of the Space Harrier series and it has a
twin cabinet so two people can play at the same
time or you can do a networked
two player game and
you actually play seated
and it's controlled through a joystick
and a missile and a bullet trigger
and you can change your views and you have
bomb buttons all on the main panel.
So you can choose either four characters.
It's Glenn, X, Cory or Nick
and basically they
fly on the screen and you are
behind them so it's
that sort of
third
person style but not
quite. And then in two player
mode you actually can dock together to save
your life and it has the opa opa in it
because you cannot have a game
in the fantasy zone without the opa
opa.
So
this game, a little bit more information
about it is that it actually
was
on the
kakaru system which
was basically a double mountain
and you can
you don't play versus you play
as a team to clear off the screen and your joystick
is an eight way stick
and it's stereo sound
and the game came out in 2001
and you know the last place that I saw one at
was at Great America when we went
to see Margaret Cho.
They had that there? They had that there.
Wow. That's pretty cool.
And I remembered because
oh the female character that
you can play basically she wears
a nurse's outfit and shoots a giant
syringe as her weapon.
But it's also cool because the final boss
in this game will
turn into a variety of different shapes
like it'll be a fish or waves
and one of the things it turns into is the Dreamcast logo.
The little squirrel.
But yeah I mean it's basically
you know you
have obstacles in your way and
when you're actually on the ground you're
running on the ground like in Space Harrier
but when you're in the air you're shooting
and it's got great music
it's got great graphics for 2001
and it only ever came out in the arcade
there was a talk of them doing a
Dreamcast port. Never happened.
Which I don't see
why they didn't because it would be super easy
given you know
how the Dreamcast is basically
now me.
The other thing that I liked about this one too and it's actually the part
that you just got to on Video Rob is it has
a shop like in
Fantasy Zone.
I was going to say it reminds me of Fantasy Zone.
Yeah so you can go in and you buy like
big bombs or more speed or
more shield
and you use it to power yourself up as you go along
because you're also collecting
your points and your money
as you go along too.
So it's just a really neat game
and they didn't
really I think make a whole lot of them
and it kind of died out so
there's no home version of this.
Now I've been trying
to find it emulated and from
what I understand
what was it that I downloaded today?
Apparently
the main
.14164
bit runs it but I
don't think very well.
I haven't been able to find much more else about
the emulation but really that's the only way
you're probably going to be able to play it unless you have to
know where one is and if you know where one is
tell me so that I can go play it.
I was so pissed off when we went to the
Sega Arcade in Seattle to Gameworks
and they did not have a Planet Harrier.
How could they not have a Planet Harriers?
They should just we need to have
a set release called
The Ultimate Fantasy Zone
which is all the Fantasy Zone games including
Fantasy Zone The Maze and Space Harrier
and Planet Harriers.
Oh you could also
you also did have a bonus of characters
in there but I did not remember how to get them.
I thought you were going to buy the former Sunrise Fun
Center and make it your bitch and you were
going to put all these great games in that place.
You know what? When I have money
I'll be doing that.
So maybe in
2035.
But that is the classic game.
There it is. Planet Harrier.
Your classic plastic game of the week.
The seat is plastic.
Your classic game
of the week. Alright we got plenty
more show to go but don't go anywhere.
We're going to be right back after this quick break
with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio
including more news on things like Minecraft
and Child of Eden on the
Playstation 3 and then we're going to talk about
getting sued. Good times.
Of course your calls and
so excited. A list list tonight.
Yay. So we're going to do a list
list tonight when we come back with more of
Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back everybody to
episode number 421 of
Orange Lounge Radio. Live on this
July the 24th of 2011
as we are live of course every
week Sunday nights at All Games Radio
www.allgames.com
and there's lots of great stuff.
If you can't tune in on Sunday nights you should listen to
allgames.com throughout the week. There's a lot of other great shows
many of them live that tape
throughout the week so check that out.
I thought before we get into part B in the
news tonight I wanted to touch on this story.
This is something that Salacious Pop brought to my
attention this week and I
thought for sure Dark Sakura
of all people might have a perspective
on this one so I'm going to kind of blindside
her a little bit with this story. Yeah. Because
this has to do with women
kind of. Let me explain.
Okay I'm equipped. Alright.
Well sort of. Wait till I get to this.
Okay. So Kotaku ran this story earlier this
week. This is something that Salacious Pop
emailed me and the title is called
Well That's One Way to Combat
Misogyny in Gaming.
And what it's basically getting at is that there's a
large LAN party that happens in Texas
and it's being organized to celebrate
the launch of Battlefield 3.
Which is you know this big game that's being launched
and so forth. They've decided that the best
way to deal with slurs
that end up getting hurled at
female gamers at these events
is to just prevent women from attending.
So no women will be allowed
to attend this event in
Texas. Let me read a
quote from the FAQ. Hold on. Hold on.
Quote
Nothing ruins a good LAN party
like a woman. No that's not the quote.
Okay. Nothing ruins a good
LAN party like uncomfortable guests
or lots of tension.
Both of which can result from mixing
immature misogynistic male gamers
with female counterparts.
Though we've done our best to avoid these
situations in years past, we've
certainly had our share of problems.
As a result we no longer allow
women to attend the event.
Now
thoughts so far before I read the
update. I will be fair. This paragraph
has since been changed but let's
let's hear dark soccer's initial reaction.
If they're a private organization
and
then they do have
the right as a private
organization. However
you
have the right to call them dickheads.
Well
it just goes back to lower
my impression of Texas.
People
do not have any logic
in the south and I can say this because I'm
there. It's like
very few people
think
outside of
the box. Just go for
well this will be the easy way we just won't have
chicks there huh? Well for this whole weekend they
will all be thinking outside of the box
because there will be no boxes at this
event if you know what I mean.
Well this is why
sorry that this
is why male
geeks get a bad rep.
You are afraid
of us. And so
when we kick your ass you have to
resort to name calling.
Like you do with
when some noob kicks your ass.
It's just immaturity
is all it is. They just name call everybody
and it's the women that get upset
about it.
Maybe if women would cry less they
get invited to these events.
Well no I think the whole thing is that
you know it would be
exactly the same if it were two guys okay.
You have guy one going oh you stupid slut
and she goes oh yeah you dumb prick.
You know instead you have like you asshole
bitch. Well I'm going to
tell you this. I'm going to tell you this.
It's not going to stop
that whole and you can't tell me this
doesn't happen in Texas.
You kill me stop being such
a fag. You're being a fag.
You're a little fag right now and
I guarantee you
in a room like that there's going to
be at least one.
Who passed the penis check.
And the other thing too if you got to
complain about people killing you in a
death match where the point is to kill
each other
I don't I don't understand why are you killing
me. Why are you killing me because it's
the point of the game. I'm calling for
infiltration.
Infiltration. Women women
run in stampede.
Burn your bras. No.
I'm calling for
chick drag. Chick drag.
You know what exists. Oh yeah
oh god. I was I was at the bar
one night with friends with a birthday
celebration. We got there a little early and we walked
right in on a drag king show. I kid you not
and that's what you'd
expect. I was some drag kings and some nice butch
lesbians to go in. It was it was very
butch. It was
not it was it wasn't sassy like
drag queens are you know. Drag queens are
very sassy. Because drag queens are taking
the ultimate of
the feminine mystique
and playing playing
it all of it up. So that's the same thing for
drag kings that they take the boring
dude-ness and make it more boring and
dudely. Alright going to the chatroom
at chat.org.com tons of comments in chat
here. Act Dev says they should ban the immature
people instead of women. Breakman
says nothing ruins. Everyone in Texas.
Nothing ruins a good sausage fest like
a woman.
Um
uh let's see
going uh what's this uh
laha says this is why we can't have nice
things. Frisbee says
this isn't the south this is Texas.
Alright look to be fair there was an update. They did remove that paragraph and here's what happened.
They're saying this event is a gentleman's retreat.
Quote we actively discourage gamers from being the kind of misogynistic jack wagon seen in the reddit post and such
behavior should not be tolerated.
Frankly we don't like that kind of
player either. So far as this event
goes it's a special event designed
specifically for male gamers.
Further it is meant as a getaway
designed to help said male
contingent become better men
both for themselves and for those who love
us.
Yeah that's more bullshit.
I gotta tell ya
I gotta tell ya
I've never been to no I was in Texas
once for like five minutes. For the few smart
people in Texas like Travis
you're not on the
stupid list. Yes. Most everybody
else is on the stupid list. I know I know plenty
of smart people in Texas and there's
some that listen to this show actually. It's just
it's like Jeff Foxworthy says
when it comes time to talk about the south
the news always points out the
least common denominator.
You know. Here's the
thing I gotta admit there's a part
of me that's a little bit tempted since it
is an all male retreat.
It's only forty nine bucks
maybe I should go and
maybe I should flame it up a little bit.
You know what. I
heard there was a retreat.
Oh my god
we're gonna play some battlefield.
I loves battlefield.
He just shot you in the head
what a stupid bitch.
There's a small
part of me that wants to even though I would
I would play up to every negative stereotype
I'm sure these guys already have like I just
you know there's that part of me that just
wants to ruin
their day. Now here's my idea.
One
you either have the infiltration go
on have a woman beat
all the guys asses and go oh by the way here's my
boobs. Or
the ladies have their own counter retreat.
Say fine
you're not inviting us bitches you're not
allowed.
And
some interesting comments from chat here
Black Wolf says are they also telling
black people to stay home. No
race is not a part of this.
So they're just sexist not racist.
They're just sexist and I'm
gonna just guess with
nothing to back me up also homophobic.
Duh it's Texas.
And maybe a little bit racist but I don't know
but no we're not seeing any apparent
racism going on here. Okay.
Salacious Pop says Loki I feel
that women who opt into participating in that
first person shooter culture know what they're getting into
to a point but neckbeards realize
this and decide to escalate it until it
becomes pretty disgusting and unacceptable
no matter what kind of game it is and a line just
gets crossed. And you should be able to shit
talk without going the gender race
gay route. It just means you're not very
articulate. Aha
become a smarter cut lower
person.
There you go. You just need to be smarter
about your
cut downs.
But I mean and I'm
and this
is why I say this and people
smart people in the south will know what I'm
talking about is that
that's just it just is like
typical. It's just
typical.
Black Wolf in our chatroom says devil's advocate
there are plenty of female only
LAN events and that's empowering girl
gamers.
True. But you you don't
want to backpedaling here a little
bit. So it makes it know that they have
the frag dolls and the reason why
they're doing well team
so they don't they don't
allow man in the frag dolls at all. Like if I try
to be a frag doll I couldn't do it.
Yeah you go ahead and play your first
person shooters step into Grand Theft
Auto and we'll own your
but
but the whole the whole point is just
that it's it's really
and break man is asking us to stop hating
on the neck beards please. He has
a neck beer and he's feeling a little offended right now so
that we need to stop being neck beer
phobic. Hey
ZZ top.
All right. But but my
point is
this is shit that I've run into
all the time when I lived in Alabama.
Like
I could be the
my geek knowledge far
exceeded any of the guys
but you know
we're doing a guy party sorry.
Fuck you.
I just kicked your ass
at this game yesterday is that why I'm not going?
No comment.
Yeah. All right look
I just wanted to bring that up at some point.
I didn't mean to you know dominate our show with that
talk but I thought it would be an interesting little
aside. We do have a list list coming up
later this hour so stay tuned for that
and also we're
going to get into the rapid fire news
but I got to do quick plugs for other shows
Hoard House is my World of
Warcraft podcast I do with my buddy
the best little Hoard House in Azeroth. We did put
out a new show this week. There's a contest
this week you got to listen to the very very very very
end but there's a contest this week as well for
free game time which any WoW player
is going to want and I know is a good prize there
so check that out. Hoardhouse.com
is the website and
yeah all the information and then some
you could stomach on the World of Warcraft
Has anyone
guessed it on any podcast or anything this week?
Yes!
What did you guess on this week? Well as I said last week
I'm on two episodes
of Pop Culture Parlay
Ah you did an episode arc. Yes.
Which you can go to
geek-life.com and download
or go on iTunes. There you go.
Ta da! All right check that out. Pop Culture Parlay
I did listen to a little bit of that first episode
you were on while I was driving to the store
or something. And I was recently on Girls
Gone Well. So you can look back for that
episode too. The Mystery Third
podcast I'm hoping will be a reality very
soon. We've just had some
We're Too Busy setbacks going on and
knowing my week next week that's
not going to get any better so we'll see what happens
I'm busy Monday Tuesday Wednesday so
Busy busy bee
So hopefully we'll get that
together. There is a third podcast coming
It's not going to
be like a huge thing. It will be like
30 minutes tops a week
Brakeman suggests you go as Captain Sassy Pants
We'll see
So yeah
that's to look forward to and then
also speaking of like guesting on shows and stuff
I just want to kind of throw that out there like
you know if you have a podcast or your own
show I've heard some
people say like oh well I would
ask you to be on the show but my show is just
this little little show that's
nothing nothing serious and you know
I never wanted to ask you guys because I'm too shy
Dude if I have the time
I will gladly come on any show
like as long as your show isn't you know
like negative
about like as long as I'm not walking into a
show that's all like homophobic trash talking
and stuff like that but you know what I mean like if you're
generally generally an intelligent person
that's all I ask I'm gonna
I'd be happy to guest on any show
Me too. The size of this show is not
that large so don't
don't feel like you can't ever approach us
No size isn't what matters it's girth
So you can email us either at mailbag
at orangeonshadeo.com or you can even email me
directly at I just I just went
right past what you said rob at orangeonshadeo.com
you got rid of yours because too much spam right
so which one oh yeah
orangeonshadeo account I got way too much but there's
there's ways to find her if you
if you message the mailbag I'll see it so
it's not like and we would be happy
as long as we can fit it into the schedule somewhere keep in mind we're on
the west coast and for a lot of and I'm on Twitter
Dark Sakura oh yeah Twitter is a great way to get
a hold of us too that's how it still got a hold of me so
excellent yeah so there you go
we're always happy to come and you know
we're approaching our tenth year of podcasting
and we want it to be a big fucking deal
so especially come next year
we're going to try and go on as many shows as we can
so we're always happy to do that
anyhow so I want to say give us more stuff to plug
at the top of part B
until our third podcast launches
alright let's get into some rapid
fire news some news that
we just didn't have time to cover elsewhere
uh yes of course
there's some more details now
out about the 360
port of Minecraft
this is coming from Notch
of course the guy behind Minecraft
and saying there's actually going to be
marketing for the Xbox 360 version
of Minecraft so I've agreed
to be slightly less transparent
than usual when it comes to that
version and
basically saying that there's going to be some
cool stuff in there including
there's completely different crafting
and that the Kinect functionality
will include a mode where you have to wave your arms
around to mine and
use items it's just too silly not to
include and also
can you actually flail as you're running away from the ghost?
ah!
uh
that's what I'm going to do at the gentleman's retreat
for Battlefield by the way don't shoot me
I don't know about that
basically
he also said that there's of course
the Xperia Play version of Minecraft
that's going to be coming out
for $7 sometime this
fall and
I guess it'll make it
it's programmed in a way that'll make it easy to port to all sorts
of mobile phones
so that's kind of neat
so I'm sure we'll hear more
details as we get closer to its
release I'm sure it'll be pretty big
um if you
just love Valve and you really want
to get your hands on some Valve action
figures and other stuff
well you're going to wait until 2012
but toy company NECA
they have revealed their lineup at
Comic Con um including
a bunch of different franchises starting with Half Life 2
you can be able to get a Gordon Freeman action
figure uh Team Fortress 2
you can get a Pyro Heavy and Demo
action figure and also
they have Left 4 Dead the Boomer and
Smoker action figures and finally
for Portal 2 Atlas
and Peabody action figures as well
as a replica um
portal gun um and a resin
and plush
weighted companion cube
so portal gun
that's going to be pretty awesome
I'm telling you though
NECA um
if you really want to impress me
you'll do full size turret
bots
they come in the box do they sing
because if that's the case I kind of want one
will it randomly
just go are you still there?
you may remember that I am still working on my paper
craft turret that is full size
I do remember that
occasionally when I'm not working
on my Grand Theft Auto stuff I'll be working on that
it looks nice
it will be uh large
alright can't wait for you to
bring that to the show are you going to bring that to episode 500?
yeah sure
um and then finally um
Grasshopper manufacturing is putting out
a new game it was featured
in Famitsu Magazine
and it is
straight up Grasshopper
um Lollipop
Chainsaw is the new game it's going to be
coming out on Playstation 3 and 360
it is basically a game about
a cheerleader raised by zombie hunters
who uses her acrobatic training
and chainsaws to destroy zombies
wasn't that a side plot
in Jurassic Park 2?
where that acrobat little girl
like kicked the dinosaur in the face
yeah they said that was retarded
this looks awesome
hey hey hey you said you're not going to use that word anymore
yeah whatever
so this should be pretty awesome
they have some screenshots up for it
she's got a chainsaw
with hearts on it and she's killing zombies
so um it sounds to me
almost a little bit like Oni Chambara
um just
hopefully plays a lot better
and of course
a Kiriyamaoka working on the sound
nice
so all good
that would have made the Jurassic Park 2
a lot better if Kiriyamaoka had done the soundtrack
did you hear there's by the way a confirmed
Jurassic Park 4 is in development
they want to bring that back
I loved those movies when I was a kid at least the first one
I think the plot of them you know
somehow making it to mainland
and kind of spreading would be pretty awesome
no because that's what happened at the end of the second movie
and it was terrible that's what made that movie so bad
no what made it bad
is just they have a feature of the T-Rex
I'm talking about like you know where
it's years later where they're multiplying
and coming out in small towns
and stuff they have the planet of the dinosaurs
you know track them down
alright anyhow moving on with other rapid fire news
Team Fortress 2 whatever happens with big games
they get demade that's right
a demake has come out of Team Fortress 2
it's now a 2D beat em up
uh it's one guy
running his own development house Eric Ruth
from Team Fortress 2
Team Fortress Arcade is the name of the game
it's an old school side scrolling beat em up
each character that's from Team Fortress
has weapons and ability that are similar to
it's class in Team Fortress 2
for example the Demoman can blast out sticky bombs
and explode whenever he does the jumping
engineerings can do upgrades
with the wrench and so forth
there's actually some hands on sessions
that have been reviewed on around the internet
and there's even a little YouTube there
that I guess some site did
review and you can actually I think he's probably
talking over this but let me see if he get
yeah he talks over that
but you can actually see here in studio we can see the
kind of gameplay emotion it looks like
that old school kind of 2D fighter it looks kind of fun
and Eric Ruth you may remember is the same guy
did all the demakes of like you know
all the NES things oh really
like the Left 4 Dead so this guy's a
pro hero yeah this guy's a pro
good uh and also announced a
comic con this week an R2D2
Xbox 360 that's right is
an Xbox 360 bundle coming with
a white Kinect and a white
Xbox 360 that is kind of skinned
so to speak to look like
a R2D2
so it's kind of got that blue and the
like little vents and so forth
I thought it was kind of neat it looks really cute
and of course it comes with Kinect Star Wars
and it's a 320 gigabyte edition
it's a 449 dollar bundle
speaking of which um
Kinect Star Wars and stuff we're doing our
you know company games something where we have
publishers out and they sometimes bring demos and stuff
I'll actually get the demo of Kinect Star Wars
Tuesday
oh nice yeah tell us what you think about
that cause it looks really bad but I'm
it could be fun we'll see
I really hope THQ brings Saints Row 3
with them we'll see
I really want them I am
upset with Act of Death right now why
for mentioning horchata and I really want some now
horchata's are delicious
I know they have places
open 24 hours that sell horchata's
if we can't get pinkberry
horchata and a taco
alright I don't know
this shows running late tonight alright we'll see
anyhow
this news is not quite as awesome as the
horchata but it's very
what is this going on here
ok remember Mortal Kombat and the download characters
Mortal Kombat and we knew for
quite some time that there was going to be
Kenshi there was going to be
Scarlet and Rain we knew those
three characters for quite some time but
Warner Brothers really kept the
fourth character under wraps for a long
time well the fourth character was revealed
this week the fourth download character
from Mortal Kombat is going to be
not Tanya not
Meat it's going to be Freddy Krueger
to which a lot of people kind of went
what kind of want
like I think that was the reaction
most of my friends was like ok
it's kind of cool I guess I'll
I can do this I like the
fatalities yeah
no yeah the fatalities in the video were pretty awesome
like throwing one into the incinerator or whatever
the furnace because you had the boiler
room and the first one that they showed
with him pulling him down and the blood coming up
that was a nod back to the first movie
that was the scene right out of the first movie
Johnny Depp awesome
so yeah Freddy Krueger
is going to be the fourth download character
it's really one of those things where you look at it and go
I don't get it but I kind of do
it's not like it's something
completely random I guess should be interesting
so yeah that will cost you
either $4.99 or $400
Microsoft points unless you're a season pass
subscriber then you're going to get it free and that
comes out August 9th so
not too far from now and there's of course
a gameplay trailer all over the internet so
check that out if you haven't already seen it
Dark Sakura
in other news
well a character that is confirmed for
Arkham City is Talia Al Ghul
oooh the daughter
of Ra's Al Ghul who is
sometimes an anti-heroine
and sometimes bad and sometimes
good but she is
going to be voiced by
Stana Katic who is in
Castle so
other characters that are going to be in there now is
the Joker, Riddler, Catwoman
Robin, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley
Quinn, yay, Penguin
Two-Face, Hugo Strange, Victor Zsasz
Calendar Man and Black
Mask
and moving forward
Dance Central is getting some new
songs. It's actually
getting one from Afrika Bambaataa
and the Soulsonic Force
Planet Rock which is one of my favorite
songs
Tayo Cruz, Break Your Heart and Trey Songz
featuring
Fabolous
it says Fabolous
larger spell but hey
I'm excited about the first one
and then last
but never least Child of Eden
gets a PS3 date
it will be on September 20th
in the US and September 23rd in Europe
and the European price
is going to be about half as much
for the PS3 version so
hey
that's it
awesome
alright I guess we should go to the Twitter although
I forgot to plug that at the top of the show
so I don't know if we actually got a lot of tweets tonight
but that's okay because we're running along
anyway so I guess something's got to give at some point
what's going on in the twatter?
let's go look at the twatter right now
before I get to Twitter though can I say
there's another game I've been playing this week that I forgot to mention
and I just caught myself looking at it
so I have to say
on the iPhone there's this game called
Tiny Tower
I think a lot of people are playing this
but yeah I'm playing
Tiny Tower and I can't stop playing
this game and what it is
it's kind of like Sim Tower
dumbed down and what's really cute about
it is that all your characters are little 8-bit characters
you have this tower you can build
these different types of levels including
apartments that they live in and
you can take characters up and down the stairs
but what I love about this most is that if you go
on the menu there's this thing called BitBook
and you can look at what the citizens of
your tower are posting on their BitBooks
and let's see
like for instance I forgot to restock
the plant nursery for like a couple hours
because I'm doing this show so one of my people
wrote on BitBook came to work at the
plant nursery but no one is here
it's just things like that but one
the other day one of them wrote something like
we're going to have a party to celebrate
so and so moving in silly hats only
and that really cracked me up because it was a reference
to the cartoon Rejected
awesome anyhow yeah that's a free
game I've been playing the shit out of that because
you know the tower bucks are what cost
money but you don't need them to play the game
so that whole thing going on
alright anyhow
back to the Twitter
let's see going to the tweets
getting into some
twats here let's see
DJ Rama has tweeted
something that's going to come up in a little bit here
on the show I think yeah it's coming up a little later
so I can't read his tweet but let me go
to Spazinator got the ball
rolling on getting my PS3 fixed yesterday
just waiting on the coffin now
non-gaming news as of today
gay marriage is now legal in New York State
I think that's terrific and
I wish our state would catch up
I'm like it's not going to send
like a gay wave across
the nation I'm like
gay people are going to be in happy
committed stuff whether
you choose to acknowledge it legally or not
and when you don't acknowledge it legally that's called
discrimination I'm like it's as simple as that
like what are you going to accomplish
banning gay marriage
nothing
but by doing it you are
I could get into that
whole rant but it's just like
I think D. Snyder said it
best in a tweet this week yes I'm referring to
D. Snyder from what was
Twisted Sister he said
something like it's 2011
if you don't finally support gay marriage then
you're the problem
anyhow
that's how I feel if you don't agree with me deal with it
let's see
I can't remember if this
is coming up later or not I think I can
talk about this one if I'm
repeating a story coming up I apologize
S.J. 100 Matt tweeted us with a story about
Bobby Kotick
Bobby Kotick opened his mouth again to spew more trash
this week now he says DJ Hero was
a huge mistake
this is in an interview
with Forbes magazine
Bobby Kotick says DJ Hero was a
passion project
we should have said well how many people
really want to unleash their inner DJ
and then out of the people who do want to unleash
their inner DJ how many want to do it in the
context of a game where you earn points
versus just taking a DJ deck
or tools on their Mac and actually being
a DJ and it turns out it's a very
small market
and Bobby Kotick said that seeing DJ Hero
fail despite critical claim in the marketing
plan that pushed it down their throats was
one of the hardest failures for him
so there you go
and he also talks about Guitar Hero
and so on
quote it was very clear people didn't want more 80's heavy
metal music but what they wanted was
very difficult for us to get from the music companies
the number one thing
that our audiences wanted in Guitar Hero was
Led Zeppelin but we couldn't get Led Zeppelin
to consent to give us the rights
interesting so kind of blaming
the failure of Guitar Hero on the music
industry and maybe there's only
so many songs that people want to play
especially when you look at Rock Band
shit Rock Band has almost everything now
seems like
and I'm always wanting more
so
moving on to
other tweets
Zether77 tweets us saying
according to a YouTube video
Oppa Oppa is a hidden character in Planet Harriers
yes
but Oppa Oppa also makes appearances in levels
ahh I see
and somebody else I'm guessing is on his
friends list what is this
KeegeeKG responded to him
and said I've been wanting that for years
like since GameCube came out
so you're not alone in your Planet Harrier love
Planet Harriers is like
it did look pretty awesome
it did look pretty awesome from the video you showed me
I kind of wish I'd played that I had no idea that
it was at Great America I just somehow
overlooked that anyhow
Tiger Claw says this is a couple tweets one of them
is about Majora's Mask that's right
on the 3DS why not because
you know we had Zelda Ocarina of Time
on the 3DS why not
Majora's Mask
well in an interview with Nintendo
Power
E.G. Onoma who is
one of the folks behind Zelda
he says that
it's a possibility
and according to him in the interview here
quote it wouldn't be an utter
impossibility to see a remake
so
I guess they're saying that if fans demanded
it they would make it
oh so that you'll do
but oh the people wanting you to port
a simple game that's already been localized
nah you'll take a shit on them
yep
although I don't know I still think
Loki there's going to be a press conference
where it says the fans demanded it
of course they're going to and they're
going to come out looking like the heroes
look at those abs dude
oh on poison
look last tweet here
from Tiger Claw about Wesley
Snipes he has made a video game
from prison absolutely
right this is Julius
Styles the International it's a video
game that Wesley Snipes not to be
confused with Julius Styles that's right
Wesley Snipes by the way most famous for his
role in Tu Wong Fu thanks for everything
Julie Newmar
he was
he's developing the game in
prison and he's developed
he's teaming up with developer Lapland
so he's been I guess writing down his ideas
while he's in prison and it's a game that
combines action movie characters
like the type of character he played in
Blade and so forth into one
I guess character in a video game
I
guess the game is only coming out on
iPad and iPhone because
those are probably the easiest platforms to publish on
and we like criminals
there you go Julius Styles if you want to support
Wesley Snipes and help fund his legal fund
you can check out this game
that's it
for the Twitter tonight at Twitter.com
slash OLR hey we're just
about to tonight's list list I'm so
excited we haven't done one of these in forever and I thought
it's high time we do another game but first
another bout of news for you
ah yes
you know it's like
every other week we have a lawsuit against Zynga
or you know
even one week we had Zynga suing
someone else but no this week it's
actually a lawsuit against Zynga over Farmville
of course the source code
apparently a
California based web developer named
social apps
they decided to
sue Zynga because of alleged
copyright infringement in violation
of trade secrets breach of written
contract breach of implied in fact
contract and breach of
confidence
their argument is that they entered into
agreement with Zynga whereas in Zynga
would receive access to their source
code for social apps
for the social apps
Facebook game my farm in exchange
for some form of compensation
according to the suit
Zynga was given the code at which point they
fled into the night never to be heard
from again social apps
claims that my farm's source code
provided the foundation for
Farmville as well as its many
derivatives and they're seeking
permanent injunction damages
attorneys fees as well as
any of Zynga's
profits or gains which can be
attributed to Farmville
so at least we have a legal
story tonight that's not some patent
or something like that I mean this claim does
sound kind of interesting where
you know you had the game my farm
and they get it so they had my
farm they gave the source code to Zynga
and then Zynga
would get would give them money
that they never got is that what's that
essentially this is about um am I hearing
this right I guess but I
don't know why if you would let someone
look at your source code and expect them
not to steal it you know what I mean
I mean it's or use it in some
way I guess exactly why
would you want to do that what would be the point
well maybe Zynga had the idea on
how to get it out there I mean Zynga before they
put out Farmville weren't they already huge for
Mafia Wars I don't know
don't care so I could see
where maybe you're gonna take somebody else's game
and make it better and market it a little
better and then make tons of money
off of it but yeah you would owe them a piece of the
profits but of course we're only hearing one side
of this have we had an official response from Zynga yet
I guess not huh
nope all right
of course
again Zynga is one of those companies where it's like
it's really hard to root for them
haha
anyhow
xbox.com
we heard about this happening
before that games would soon
be a part of xbox.com
but now I guess with
games for windows you know now combining with
xbox.com there are four
free trial games that you can play
on the xbox 360 homepage
you can play them right in your browser
and you don't have to install them to your computer or anything
now the games that you can play
plants vs zombies
bejeweled 3, zuma's revenge
and text twist 2 which are all
pretty much popcap games or there's
stuff that sound right off of uh
um what is
it the uh zone
msn zone has been around forever and it had
all those games too and it's kinda weird that
microsoft hasn't brought that into the fold if they haven't already
does that still exist
I remember I had an account there like
forever ago
yeah zone msn.com still exists
I'm really surprised this isn't in the fold too
I mean these are like as casual as they get
games though
this is where you can play such winners as
bubbles you play them in your sleep
that's casual and patchworks
and fishdom
spooky splash
but you can also play
bejeweled 3 on there so it's
pretty interesting I don't know
but yeah there you go uh those games are now
playable free on xbox.com
maybe a sign of things to come
I don't know I bet people would be a lot more interested
if you could earn achievements in those games
and I'm totally serious when I say that by the way
totally serious
alright one more story till we get to list list tonight
Dark Sakura
well how about
something that
I had to make sure that it wasn't a joke when I
first saw it
the com is announcing street fighter vs hello kitty
I'm not joking
wait what?
fall 2012 street fighter and hello kitty
will have a single game together
so I could like play as bats maru
and like kick ihonda's ass
I guess but they
put up a picture of
kitty dressed up as chun li
it was like just a flash
on the screen
and uh
there's nothing else you know really
about it but the quote says
that this is from Joshua Izzo
who's the director of licensing with capcom
capcom has long admired Sanrio
and their ability to create memorable
and cherished lifestyle brands so it is
a distinct pleasure to partner with them for this
new crossover line of merchandise
so it looks like it's just merchandise really
yeah it's just like handbags
and wallets could you imagine them doing
pocket fighter with Sanrio characters
that would be weird
that would be kind of weird but funny
that's kind of cute
I don't know like there's a part of me
like when I first heard this story I was like
no way are they making a game and then I heard it was
the merchandising and I'm like that is really
weird and I see the picture of hello kitty as chun
li and I'm like what in the actual
fuck is this and why do I still
really want it? I want a bats maru
done up as gulkey
I think bats maru would probably get the ryu
treatment I think that's what I'm gonna see
no dear daniel would you think? I think
we'll see
but I love this chun li kitty it's so adorable
I want that
alright
anyhow let's get to listless
I'm so excited we haven't done a
game here on OLR in a long time so let's
let's do listless
tonight we are going to create the
definitive list on a particular
topic in gaming and
here's the way that listless works we're gonna all
go around in studio and I'm gonna bring on
a guest on the phone here in a moment and we're
each gonna bring up our list of three
possible choices to put on
the list but then the difficult part we all
go around and eliminate one from
the list that will leave us with a list of eight
possible answers for the
topic and then you guys
in the chat room will get to vote on your number
one and number two picks so our
list combined with your votes create the
definitive list
for this topic and there's no argue this is a highly
scientific process there's no arguing
this is what the fans want
alright so I bet you all are
dying to know tonight's topic
well earlier tonight we talked about
Freddy Krueger being in Mortal Kombat
so now it's pretty clear that Mortal Kombat
is clearly adding whatever character
they want doesn't even have to be
in the Mortal Kombat mythos
so what character should
be next
that's right Mortal Kombat
is adding characters so what character
should be next let me bring on
a fourth panelist tonight
now I have to admit I was trying to get
Extifer tonight because
it would have been fun and I know he plays the Mortal Kombat
series but unfortunately he
had to bow out so he's
not going to be able to be on the show tonight he was getting
his asshole bleached
exactly exactly
right so he couldn't join us
but I got a substitute that
tends to substitute for Extifer over
on Horde House as well when needed so
here
here we go I'm going to give him a call right now
one ringy dingy
hopefully it rings I don't know
here we go hello hello
hey slices pop hey what's up
hey not much welcome to Orange Laundry
or welcome back rather
and thanks for thinking how since I've moved
up in here with you I'm sort of on the show
less than when I was when I lived in the bay
I know it's kind of but here you are you're back again
tonight you're welcome to come over whenever you want
filling in for Extifer sort of
that's who I was trying to get for this segment tonight
but just like on Horde House you are saving the day
so I appreciate it
now usually we have guests
we usually have guests on here to plug
websites or
their own podcast
is there anything you want to plug tonight?
I was
also the guest commentator
on the most recent episode of
Horde House for WoW discussion if anyone cares
about that but otherwise not really
no I hate WoW and I hate Horde House it's a bad
show
you should probably stop producing it
because you're one of the co-hosts
alright let's get
to tonight's list
alright so you've already been briefed on the
topic at hand so everybody here in studio
should have their and on the phone should have their
top three answers now that Mortal Combat
is clearly adding whatever character they
want what character should be next
now we're also relying on those of you
in chat to give your answers
because if one of us has an item
to get duplicated on the list or something
where we don't want to say the same thing twice
we often turn to chat to help us
out so chat.orangelandradio.com
if you want to give your opinions
so let's start forming the list and we'll
let ladies go first
so DarkSakura what is your number three
answer? What character should be in
Mortal Combat next?
Ash from
Evil Dead
Ash from Evil Dead?
Could you imagine how awesome that would be?
Weren't there always rumors
of like an Ash versus Freddy versus
Jason movie? There was
yeah and he actually did a comic
of Army
of Darkness versus Marvel Zombies
and he was in it. Interesting
yeah so
not out of the entire realm of possibility
of Ash being in a fight again. And you know Bruce
Campbell likes money. Yeah of course
alright I'll go next
I'm going to say my number three answer is
Barney the purple dinosaur
this is my number three answer
because who doesn't want to
perform a fatality on Barney?
I love you
you love me
let's go and beat up Barney
with a baseball bat
we'll knock him to the floor
no more purple dinosaur
there you go I'll never sing again on this program
ladies and gentlemen
Barney the purple dinosaur
is he even on TV anymore?
I think so
alright
are you a big fan of Barney Slice of Pop?
I have two half
brothers that are significantly younger than me
and they were toddlers during the
early and mid 90s which was when
Barney the dinosaur ruled the fucking world
so yeah my
16 year old ass had to sit at home
and watch those VHS tapes 20
30 times in a day. So how do you feel
how do you feel about Barney Immortal Combat?
There's some trauma there. I think I
could get out my
PTSD my post-traumatic
stress disorder by killing him
in Mortal Combat from my teenage
years I would be a fan of that
alright awesome
Loki we'll go to you next. What's your number 3 answer?
My number 3 answer
Colonel Sanders
Why the man from KFC?
It would be hilarious. It reminds me of
Project Aco
It's the Colonel
I love it
Alright
Slice of Pop, your number 3 answer
This might be a little bit
obscure but for those who remember
the Spawn comic
Spawn from the 90s, Angela
Angela from Spawn
Oh
She's got the
TNA and she's got the brutality
so I think she'd be a great fit
Slice of Pop taking it serious
I like this. Angela from the Spawn comics
a very serious answer that I'm sure will not
survive the elimination round but we'll see what happens
I'm just kidding. Tell us a little more about
Angela for those that aren't familiar with the comics
and I didn't see that movie either
Uh
Spawn was a demon from hell
after this alien sort of
usurped Lucifer from hell
and he was kind of, so Spawn was a demon
Angela was this badass angel
from heaven except she would
fucking kill you. She was you know brutal
it wasn't a very feathers
and wings and pretty choir
angels with halos. She was
she was really a
force to be reckoned with so I
definitely think she could kick some ass in Mortal Combat
Alright, excellent. Alright, let's see if
it survives. We've got more to
go though. Those are the number 3 answers
Ash from Evil Dead, Barney the Purple
Dinosaur, Colonel Sanders and Angela from the
Spawn comics. Let's go to the number 2s
Dark Soccer, your number 2 answer
Um, Pyramid Head
Pyramid Head
from Silent Hill. Need I ask
why? No you don't need to
I could
ask but then I might end up dead right?
He's badass
and that's actually a serious suggestion. Alright
that's a good answer. Pyramid
Head is on the list there. I saw that in chat
and actually when I saw it go by in chat
Zethur in chat suggested when I saw that I was like
oh I'm taking that one if one of mine gets stolen
but since now
it's already on the list I'll use my original number
2 answer which I'm sorry this
would be badass and this should absolutely
be in Mortal Kombat and
who is a
character? I'm going to ask this question
Who is a character more scary
than Freddy Krueger and Jason
combined? Who is the scariest
fucking character ever in the history of ever?
My mother pissed off? No
Pennywise the Clown
Oh my god
And that's my number 2 answer. Pennywise
the Clown. I am afraid of clowns
and I really hate that clown
So don't you want to kill one?
Well Shang Tsung turned into
Well you know Shang Tsung's clown fatality
was supposed to be Joker's fatality
Oh wow
In the DC vs. Mortal Kombat
It was the fatality
But
No it was supposed to be they changed it
No it's exactly the same as the fatality
that Joker used in
Because he wasn't supposed to actually shoot him
Yeah well it goes off camera
Yeah it goes off camera but
but you see the whole thing in
Mortal Kombat Alright
So there you go. Pennywise the Clown from IT
Alright
Loki what's your number 2 answer?
My number 2 answer is the most
frightening thing beyond Pennywise
the Clown
that is just hit media
all together and that would be Lady Gaga
If anyone deserves to be torn apart
as strange as fucking hell is Lady Gaga
Hey! Hey!
You could do some Ermac and some Noob Saibot
fucking crazy morphing shit with those costumes
of hers You could it would be costume
morphing and like her costumes would be like
those bubble dresses would be filled
with acid and shit like I would play as
Lady Gaga and I would beat your ass
I would shove a 9 inch
stiletto in your characters eye
For the record Becky said she jumped when you said Pennywise
I'm telling you Pennywise is a scary
mother fucker Alright there you go
Lady Gaga. Oh I love this
DDR dollar villain chat suggests Pennywise
turns into a giant spider for a fatality
That's good
Alright
Uh, Salacious Pop it's over to you
What's your number 2 answer?
So the key question to this list list
is characters
and not people so
I'm saying Rose mother fucking Nylund
from the Golden Girls
Betty White
Rose Nylund
Rose Nylund
She'll kill you
And
what would Rose Nylund's fatality be
would it be a story from St. Olaf
Yes she'd tell us St. Olaf story
and you would take a shotgun and you would kill yourself
Alright
I always
Hey I always wanted my
Golden Girls game that was Grandma Got Guns
and it was about the Golden Girls just going on
a rampage to save their retirement
home or whatever. Alright so Rose Nylund
is uh
Salacious Pop's number 2 answer. Alright here it is
time for the number 1 answers
and we're gonna go around and get them
Let me read the list so far
Ash from Evil Dead, Barney the Purple Dinosaur
Colonel Sanders, Angela from Spawn, Pyramid Head
Pennywise the Clown from IT
Lady Gaga and Rose Nylund
who is of course Betty White from the Golden Girls
Alright so now it's time to get the number 1
answers. Dark Sakura
I went serious with all my answers you know
I picked Sera Pizzini
Witchblade
You gotta spell that last name for me
I was thinking of her
when Rob told me what Luke was
ZZINI
Okay P-I-Z-Z-I-N-I I don't know this character
either you gotta explain this to me a little bit
The Witchblade basically is like this
gauntlet that's stuck on one hand but it
will turn into any weapons and the armor
so she's like wearing like this big metal ball
but she's all coated in the weapon
Alright
I think the Elts got like half of it and now there's
a new Witchblade and I kind of got
out of it around then but there was also
a cool
Battle of the Planets crossover where
and keep in mind
I know all the Gachamon names so I think in
Battle of the Planet it's just called Princess
Whoever Jun the Swan was in Gachamon
She got the Witchblade so it was a
neat kind of crossover but other than that
you know I think that
I just always liked the character so
she'd be badass
I'm gonna get to my number one answer
My number one answer is also a very serious answer
like I really think and Salacious Pop might be mad
at me because I have a feeling this could be who he's thinking
too so I apologize in advance
if this is your answer Salacious Pop but I have to say
a character I would honestly love to see
in Mortal Kombat that would kick a lot of ass
would be Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill
Hell yeah!
That was of course
Uma Thermos character in Kill Bill
Was that your answer Salacious Pop?
Well um I was gonna
say uh
she's the best character
in the whole thing and I can't
Daryl Hannah who did she play?
Oh um
Black Mamba
No Black Mamba was Beatrix
She was California
King Snake but the character was
L Driver
Was that your number one really?
No no I was going to but I'm gonna switch something else now
because Beatrix is better
Alright so there it is Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill
How could I not? I'm just like
my god she kicks so much ass
I would hate to see her die but at the same time
she's gonna just chop bitches arms off and so forth
so there you go Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill
is my number one answer
Loki your number one answer
My number one answer
unfortunately he is
he has passed but uh
Billy Mays
Billy Mays hi guys
Billy Mays here
Would he actually show off something
in his infomercial before killing you with it?
He would throw OxiClean on you
He would die
He would spray you with OxiClean and then start
scrubbing away until your face came off
There you go there you go
Alright Billy Mays
I could use the Kaboom or whatever
Alright so SlaciousPop it's down to you
Eleven on the list so far
One spot left
SlaciousPop what is your number one answer?
Mr. Rogers
Mr. Rogers
Mr. Rogers
Are you inspired by the ultimate battle of ultimate destiny?
From Mr. Rogers neighborhood
Was that a yes?
Yeah
I knew it
So why Mr. Rogers?
No one is that nice
You gotta have a dark vibe
He actually was really that nice in person
Yeah
Like seriously
You know those
A-holes at that particular church in
Kansas I don't want to name them on the show but we
all know who they are right they're the guys that protest
the funerals and all that stuff right
And you know actually a lot of that
stuff it pissed me off but I didn't get
really pissed off until they were gonna protest
Mr. Rogers funeral and I was like
You don't fucking like Mr. Rogers
will fuck you up
Like
He'd kill a kindness
He will sick King Friday and Madame
what's-her-name and all those people on your
ass he will tie you to that carousel and spin
you around till you throw up that's what will
happen He'd kill with kindness
There you go Mr. Rogers
an act deft in chat says in a blood stained
sweater alright so here's
Rob you've heard the ultimate battle of ultimate
destiny haven't you? I haven't
Guess
You need to play it during the break
Well there is no more break we're in part B
Do it next week
Alright here we go uh here's the list
of twelve Ash from Evil Dead
Barney the Purple Dinosaur
Colonel Sanders Angela from Spawn
Pyramid Head Pennywise the Clown
from IT Lady Gaga
Rose Nylund who is Betty White and the
Golden Girls Sarah Pizzini from Witchblade
Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill
Billy Mays and Mr. Rogers
we have all sorts of answers here
some serious some very much not
but now I almost said
Snuffleupagus
Oh bird yeah some of the answers
that missed my list uh Kenny from South Park
and I was just gonna say Chun Li
but let me read some of the answers from chat
Rob I also I had Undead Michael Jackson
on my list originally
Oh nice nice
I almost thought about Voldemort but
I'm surprised no one said Amy Winehouse I mean that would be
Actually I changed Amy Winehouse to Michael Jackson
Oh there you go
uh Tigerclaw said how about Justin Bieber
there you go
Wyland says Sam from Trick or Treat
uh act deft says how about Bobby Kotek
uh let's see
who's from Hellraiser let's see uh I believe
that will show us Tigerclaw says Snake Pliskin
Giant Enemy Crab
uh J100 Matt says
America McGee's Alice I don't know if he was responding
to another question Zither said Panty and Stalking
um
let's see
trying to look quickly through
Elmer Fudd
seriously says Legend of Zaku
Tigerclaw says how about the Queen
Alien from Aliens
uh there's a few people saying Pikachu
Laha says Pikachu
Pikachu
so they go oh and uh Jovidea says Ronald McDonald
there you go alright
so
now is the time where we eliminate things from
the list I know this is going to be very difficult but unfortunately
some items are going to have to come
off the list so here we go
insulation pop I posted it to you in a
private message so you can follow along here
um Dark Sakura
this is hard these are all good answers tonight
we don't often have this in list list
usually like there's a couple shitty ones on there but these are
all good but unfortunately
this is a scientific process and for the scientific
process to continue something
must come off the list Dark Sakura which of these
is not worthy of the list I would have to say
Barney because I find him even more
traumatic than anything else in the
universe and just I wouldn't
be able to fight him because I would have to pause
the game and go throw up alright Barney
the purple dinosaur has been stricken from the list
uh I am going to remove
I'm sorry I do think this is a great idea
but it's just a little too crazy
I'm taking Billy Mays off the list
Billy Mays is not worthy of the list so it has been stricken
from the list Loki which of these is not
worthy of the list?
unfortunately it's not the
golden girl I would have picked so
Rose Nylund has to be removed off the list
Bea Arthur was a close second
Bea Arthur is a bad ass bitch
you should have just went with Maude
and then there's Maude
I have to
share this with you do you ever watch the
Deadpool PSAs? No
Deadpool had a minor obsession
with Bea Arthur, ok a major obsession with Bea Arthur
and it had a poster in the
the thing that said don't you wish your girlfriend was
hot like Bea
yes alright
so Rose Nylund has been stricken from the list
so nine items
remain Salacious Pop it comes down to you
one of these must come off the list for us to proceed
which of these is not worthy of the list Salacious Pop?
Pennywise the
clown
why that was the best answer on there
and I'm saying that because I'm totally biased
why are you getting rid of Pennywise?
Warner Brothers ain't trying to bring class action
lawsuits at people just you know
being terrified at this game
cause that's some traumatic shit
however wouldn't it have been cool to actually get Tim Curry to voice him
I know right
or just have Tim Curry
I'm so angry
Frank should be in it
Frank and Porter should be in it instead
I'm so angry
alright
Tigerclaw says
how awesome it would be if Ash was in
Mortal Kombat his little intro animation
would be him showing up and saying okay
she bitch let's go
alright here it is here are the eight items you can
vote on tonight Ash from Evil Dead
Colonel Sanders
Angela from Spawn, Pyramid Head
Lady Gaga
Sarah Pizzini from Witchblade
Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill and
Mr. Rogers those are the items
left on the list
there is a death mob going on
in chat
this always happens though
it's just a part of listless a popular answer
always gets taken off the list
hey no kicking allowed
you're not allowed to kick him
don't kick him from chat
that is hilarious I don't mind
hold on a minute no no
Rama needs to remember who the queen bee is here in chat

Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill and
Mr. Rogers send your number one

in just a little while here on the show
Salacious Pop
yes
are you reading what the chatroom is saying now
are you regretting your decision
I'm being egged on
to retaliate by someone and I won't say who
and I will
respect the fact that I have ops
temporarily and I will not do it
alright plus you don't want to
have a no getting laid
warranty for two weeks
yeah that's true
alright Salacious Pop
thank you once again for filling in tonight
and we appreciate you had some great answers tonight
despite the elimination
controversy quickly anything you
want to plug like your Twitter or anything like that
I don't know if you do writing online or whatever that you want to plug
I just want to say that don't
worry you'll float we all float down
here
alright there you go
thanks Salacious Pop
bye
alright
while those votes come in let's get back
into some other gaming news and we're going to
go over to Loki
with some news about GameCube games
yes apparently Nintendo director of
entertainment and trend marketing Amber
McCollum
was quoted
during an interview with
Nintendo Gal on the subject
of GameCube games not being playable on the upcoming
Wii U
McCollum said GameCube disc
will not be compatible with the Wii U
but a number of games that were
playable on the GameCube can be downloaded
from WiiWare
and people were like really
is that going to be possible
are you going to be able to download games
via some sort of storage device
or something like that
of course when asked to clarify
that statement
they went and said to clarify the
capabilities of the Wii U system
as correctly stated the Wii U will not be able to
play Nintendo GameCube disc
however Nintendo has not made any announcement
regarding download content so they kind of
back stepped a little bit but it sounds
like that maybe that's something
that they're going to be working towards
is having GameCube games downloadable
do you think that will really happen
because it would seem to be like the
GameCube games are kind of large but then again
we have Xbox 360 games and so forth
I'm not sure if they would do that
I think if anything they would just re-release
GameCube games or touch
them up somewhat and
re-release them on like they were doing
the new play control stuff where it was on a Wii disc
but it was a GameCube game I could see more
of that happening right
because it gives them an excuse to charge more money
and I would gladly pay for
F-Zero GX all over again though to be honest
I'm not even going to lie like take my money
I would gladly pay you tomorrow for a hamburger
today you be quiet
alright moving on
to a story about iRAM
do you know the company iRAM have you ever heard of iRAM?
Breaking R-Type! Hello! That's right they made R-Type
they made a lot of other interesting games too
but here's the deal
R-Type there's a few of these games on the PSP
like there's R-Type Tactics on the PSP
R-Type Tactics 2
there's also the game Archives have
R-Types and R-Types Delta these are all over the
Playstation Network and Playstation Go
well guess what? Come August 11
these games are going away
iRAM is taking their catalog off of the
Playstation Network and
the same thing goes for their specific Playstation
home lounges
they had some like I guess 9 lounges
that were about these games
they are all going away
I guess the Doki Doki Suikoden
lounge is the only one that's staying
I don't know
so yeah iRAM has not said why
they're going away but these games
on PSP are no longer going to be available
now a lot of these I've never heard of
there's games like these are all very
Japanese titles
2 based on cartoon cone
bumpy trot beagle battle tournament
these are all games that are downloadable right now
on Playstation Network they are going to be going away
on August 11th I wonder if this is
some type of retaliation
so to speak for the PSN being down
for so long
I don't know nah it's probably just licensing
coming up and they decided not to renew it
or something gotcha
alright well there you go
they are coming off of Playstation Network
so enjoy them while you can not like I can't bust
out you know the master system
and play art type the original system right
yeah alright let's go to the mailbag
every week you guys email us
mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com
and Dark Soccer dives in the
mailbag head first and pulls out some of her favorite
emails to read right now
by the way this is also the last call for
votes in tonight's list list get them in
now or they will not count
to send a private message type slash MSG
sky vote 1 and vote 2 there you go
give Rob your sodium yes
greetings OLR thanks
for helping my commute to work a more pleasant one
with your podcast I really
find this debate of online passes and used
games quite interesting a long time gamer like
yourselves I actually
I am actually quite indifferent about
this tactic I do buy most of my games
new like Rob though I do dabble
in the occasional used title here and there as well
while I am not foolish enough to believe that
every used game equals a lost new game
sale it would be equally foolish to
assume that new game sales aren't somewhat
hurt by the used game market
frankly I don't buy the whole spin about
online passes being for servers or what not
it's simply a way to be able to
get a piece of the used game market for publishers
that being said I have no problem
with that being a pitfall of buying a
used game everything is included
with a new purchase so I will
always have and
more often than not choose that
option the harsh reality is
that game makers and publishers
owe nothing to used game purchasers because it
doesn't make them any money directly
I know that this
slippery slope argument exists
at the same time I give consumers more credit
than Loki may that they can look at each
issue on a case by case basis and reject
ideas that they feel cross the line
I have often wondered if there could be
a moratorium on used game sales
placed for maybe 3 or 6 months
so that new games aren't hindered by used
game sales at the end of the day
both used games and new games have their place
for now and I can't begrudge anyone
for choosing what solution works for them
thanks to all of you darkcharger
PS if the show is interested in
a new copy of Adobe Lightroom 3
yes
Jamie is
yes email
me and I will send it to you as a gift
thanks again for the podcast I wish that
I could listen live more often
yes
saved
I think
the idea is interesting about the whole moratorium
but I just don't think it's possible
because you'd be telling people they can't
sell their own new product
like what's to stop me from
going to my neighbor saying oh yeah you want this game
I don't really play it here give me 40 bucks
it would never happen because you're basically telling people
that when they're done with their game that they can't trade it
back into I mean okay let's say that they're able
to sell it back to GameStop but GameStop's not gonna sell
they're not gonna sit on a bunch of
product that's gonna be devaluing
you know over time especially when they're
taking trades in on games you know to
see that's the thing
is they use game sales
it gets people to trade in their games
to like a GameStop or something like that so they
buy those new games that you
want them to buy
but now if you take that money source
away I guess of them
if you basically ban used game
sales or make it not very
pretty to the fact that
it devalues the used game
then they're not gonna have money to
buy that new game that you want
to buy so you see you're in turn
hurting yourself
but they won't figure that out until
everyone jumps on board with this type of
you know scheme
and then it affects them down
the line and they're like ah crap
why did we do that?
You know and I'm kind of
in the boat as this guy I mean he already said he's
kind of like me where you either buy it new or you don't buy it
and especially considering what I talked about at the
top of the show as in one particular store I will
not be shopping at anymore for new or used games
I mean there's your biggest used market right
there but not
to say I would never buy a game used I mean there's
obviously other people trying to get in that market as well
but honestly I find now
by the time I want to go back
and get an old game and
I'd be actually looking for it used cause you usually can't
find the new game used it's so hard
to get it like I think the last
new game that I bought used was the Tron
game and I
the minute I played it I could see why somebody sold it
back right away so usually
you know if a game's really that good you can't
find it used right away
we go buy used games though fairly
regularly but that's just
because we might want to finish a collection
but I think at this point if I did want to
go get a used game I would just check the price on
Amazon or you know other competing
internet websites like Best Buy or whatever
and see what the price is and if it's
good enough I'll just buy it online
so
until one of those stores pisses me off
then I'll stop shopping there too
alright next email
hello olr
here's an orange lounge foodie-o question
but it does relate to a video game do you think
dominos will ever bring back the noid
we need a new yo noid
game dammit
brought to you by sizzler
home of the 3 day old salad bar that tastes like shit
and gives you the shit the squits
that's from chiggers
who by the way did get his name from where you thought
ewww
he said he had it as a kid or something like that
and that's where he got his name
I either
he emailed horde house about that or I ran into him
on wow and we brought that up
let's see
do I think dominos would ever bring back the noid
no dominos did this really interesting
thing where they kind of came out and admitted that their pizza
tastes like shit and that they're going to totally
redo it like it was this very interesting
campaign that they did and it worked
like dominos sales have been up quite a bit
in the past year or so people like that
self deprecating sense of humor and I think
because of that because dominos is trying to distance
themselves from the past you're not going to see the
noid ever come back I think the noid is something that's very
80's well never
say never but you're not going to see it in the next
5 years no so
sadly that would mean the same for the yo noid
game here's a question for you guys though
do you think we'll see any other like
commercial product video games
again because we used to get these all the time
back in the day like there was the mick kids game
the california raisins game
where the hell is my damn
burger king connect games were the most
recent ones they're supposed to have the burger king connect
game and they never fucking put it out
I don't know so we'll see
and now
burger king's all over transformers but no games
about chiggers
transformers all hasbro
the end no I'm kidding how about
another email yes another email
yes okay
I'm a few shows behind in my listening but
I just want to respond to Rob with his
opinion that college is a waste of money and you
learn better by doing I 100%
agree I spent 5 years in
college earned 2 bachelors degree television
production and asian studies graduated
summa cum laude in the top 10%
of my class I can be quoted
as saying frequently that the only good thing that
I got back from college was a husband
aside from being an abstract requirement
BK have
a BA when we don't care which one
nobody cares about all the painstaking
work I did in college I haven't touched editing software
since I left I haven't spoken Japanese Chinese
or Spanish since I left
all of the hard earned knowledge has faded away
and the reality is set in unless you're going to be
a doctor lawyer or something that requires daily
use of the knowledge you got in college it's
ultimately a costly waste of time
the job I have now has
diddly to do with my fancy degrees and I'm still
paying on the $2,000 I have
left in college bills when I have kids
they're going to trade school and learn to be plumbers
or HVAC technicians or car mechanics
and at
least then I will be secure in the knowledge that
what they've learned is useful and the
very least will save them money because they can fix
their own stuff Holly V
now I do have to say though
in the design field like
what I'm in college
college ends up being useful
because the classes that I take have
practical application for what
I'm doing I've built my
portfolio I've marketed myself
I'm already getting work and I
haven't finished college so I'm just
saying well and I want to be careful too I don't want to become
like this anti-college spokesperson because I wasn't
quite the point of my rant but I think what
I was meaning to get at is that it's not for everyone
and I think some people kind of
feel like there's this necessity like
I have to go I have to go and you
maybe you don't you know that's all
I'm kind of saying and you know will I ever go
back someday and finish maybe
but right now for the career that I'm doing
I would be better off spending my time getting
certifications and licenses and
things from organizations that support
my industry and not really a state school
I hate to say it but that's
where my
enrichment is going to come from now let me put it this way
college isn't for everyone but it might be for
you and your field and whatever you're doing
and here's my honest advice if you are going to go to
college here's the mistake not to make
make sure you don't do
nothing but school
okay if you're going to go to college
make sure you do some extracurricular activities
make sure you do internships
oh my god take I mean
I know it might sound ludicrous like I gotta do something and don't
get paid but the networking and experience
you're going to get from that are going to mean so
much more than your
A's and B's I'm serious
also make friends with your teachers
who are working in the field
yeah you're not in high school anymore it's not
cool to hate your teachers well I mean
keep in mind now I'm in school to be
a graphic designer which was
funny because I learned a lot of the programs
and stuff on my own but
I have picked up so much
in design technique and in theory
and just in studying
you know I
the best classes I've taken are my two
art history classes and my typography
class those have been my favorite so far
that and my portfolio class
which you've seen my portfolio
it came out fully
interview ready
I've got my portfolio online if anyone wants to see my
stuff just let me know and I will show you
and then hire me please
I will say this too you might be surprised
to hear me say this but I actually think it also
would be a good use of your time if this is
a scene you are into and if this is something you are
into join a fraternity or a sorority
that definitely was not the
scene for me but you know what
for some people I know that have been in that scene it has
been an
immensely helpful networking tool
like immensely helpful
networking tool you would be like those are connections
you're going to have for life so it's
been very rewarding for some people I know so
you know but it's not
for everyone either and it's really
about finding the right one for
you is a huge challenge
well and also find
different clubs or online
groups that people
in your field are going to like
you know if you're in engineering look for stuff
through the department of engineers you know that type
of stuff and if you're going to go to college
just to drink do yourself and do
the college a favor and don't go to college
or at least get a liberal arts degree
no not even that I'm just going to say
do yourself a favor and don't go to college
like you will be wasting money
you'll be wasting time
one thing about college though that I will say
is that
it gives you a chance to experiment
with new ideas and
to pick
different things because I've changed my
major like nine times before I finally just
decided to go with what I loved anyway
because I started off
as a forensic geology major
did you know that? I studied
rocks for blood
it was boring
as fuck
and then I changed my major so many times
and finally decided to stick with
art with something in the art field
I hate doing illustration for other people
because it's not my drawings anymore
but I love doing design for other people
and I've developed a passion
for it but I wouldn't have known that
design was where my heart was
until
I tried to do illustration and
I tried to do all this other stuff and eventually
I found the right path
by, and I even found out that
specifically print is my passion
and I would never have known that
if I had not taken typography
right then and there, if I had not taken the
InDesign class, so I'm just saying
as an example, school
is a good place to experiment
without
getting a job that you're going to hate
you know what I mean? So
I'm not going to continue my
rant, I said what I said a couple
shows ago and I stand by that
you know, but yeah
it's not for everyone, but it might be for you
and that's okay. It's your money
spend it how you want to spend it
Next email
Hi OLR crew, this is your
friendly neighborhood Mexican act Deft
I'm pretty sure you have already talked and discussed
about Capcom this week, but I want to vent a little
and share my two cents on their most recent happenings
Well needless to say, as many people
have probably said now, I
pretty much lost all faith in Capcom
Was it because of the release of
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3? No
I actually think, I actually
was pretty excited about
especially because of the addition of Phoenix Wright
Yeah granted, they're doing an update to a game not even
nine months after release of the first edition
Capcom has always done this kind of stuff
with all their fighting series and
I've learned to accept it. If you know Capcom
then you pretty much expect it to do so
which by the way, that actually did remind
me of something
when they did
all the different matching service
and different versions of Street Fighter 3 like
Second Strike and Third Impact
That's the same thing
Anyway, so why have I lost my confidence
in Capcom? It's because of all their
recent decisions as a company
and there's a lot of things that I can name
or list here. Unnecessary DRM
Mercenaries 3DS, Bionic Commando
Rearm 2, Super Street Fighter
4, Arcade Edition
The Cancellation of Games, Mega Man
Universe, Unnecessary Reboots, Devil May Cry
No localizations of games
people truly want, No Word on Monster Hunter
nor Ace Attorney Investigations 2 being localized
Little by little, Capcom has
done really bad decisions
that have really affected the fans
A company that was recently known
to cater to the fans and still even now
they kind of do it, is losing a lot of stuff
that have their fans
really angry, including me
and I think the straw that broke the camel was
the cancellation of Mega Man Legends 3
People have wanted that game for so long
and they just took it from them like
if nothing happened. And with this
also comes the slow killing
of Mega Man. Mega Man X was the most
wanted for MVC 3
and they didn't mention him being an ultimate
All of those things they've done
little by little have created a really
big ball of shit and they can't hide it now
and even if they do, the stink is so big
people will be reminded because of it
Capcom has created their own demise and unless
they do something to fix this problem, or at least
they admit they do have a problem
I won't be buying any game they release anytime
soon. And I mean it, not even
the Darkstalkers teaser they showed in their
Street Fighter X Tekken panel
Oh yeah, that hasn't even come up in the show yet
but yeah. A game I have wanted
to make, I've wanted them to make
for a long time
won't blind me of all they have done to lose
me as a fan. As Zekeman said in his
Tumblr and Twitter, Capcom, it's not me, it's you
Thanks for reading this
and for keep on giving gamers a voice
Act deft
Last email? I'm curious to see
how long that holds, and I'm not trying to be like
a jerk about it, but you know, usually this
internet rage, and then they'll announce something
you just have to have
But um, you know, obviously Capcom
surprisingly went from
all the fans love them and have very
loyal fans, to literally within the scope
of two weeks, have become
like, quote, the
Japanese Bobby Kotek, you know
what I mean? Like, it's just interesting
My How the Mighty Have Fallen
And uh, yeah, I
I just think the way Capcom cancelled it too
didn't help. And it's
it sucks that they said, hey, let's
involve this community, our hardcore fans
in a game, and then tell them the game isn't good enough
It's essentially what they did, that's
that's tough. That's a tough pill to swallow
Anyhow
Um, last email?
Yep. Hi, OLR
Just wanted to write in after the last few
weeks, comments from Capcom's David Reeves
I, I was more than
a little miffed at what he said
This coming from the same guy who used to
run Sony of Europe, and said that when
the PS3 was launching, that we have
built up a certain brand equity
over time, since the launch of
Playstation in 1995 and PS2 in 2000
The first five million are going to buy it
whatever it is, even if it doesn't
have games. And then he linked
to the full article, uh, interview
Anyway, I'm not going to rant, so I'll be off
Catastrophic Moggy
I don't like that, Catastrophic Moggy
Yeah
It's kind of dickly
Not, not muggy, but
all the stuff
Oh, that's not the interview
Sorry, I'm reading over your shoulder here
Yeah, this is the interview
It's a pretty long one, but
Like, one of the questions
Um, are you confident in your
approach and the inevitable buildup to
November's launch hype? And he says
without being too arrogant, I don't think we
worry too much about building up the hype in the
first six months, because when the rubber hits
the road is going to be when all those hardcore
gamers have bought PS3s
They have also bought Xbox 360s and they
probably bought Nintendo Wii as well
So basically, you know
There's a lot that haven't, though
There's a lot of people that only adopt one of
those systems, you know?
I don't know
That guy says a lot of very interesting things
Alright, that's going to do it for email tonight
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
if you want to send us an email for a future week
In the meantime, I believe it's time
to get the ranting on
in a segment we call the FUs of the Week
Let's go to the FUs of the Week right now
Music
An FU to the bee sting I got on my neck
And the stinger didn't break the skin
Well, it broke the skin, but not like
it didn't get stuck in there
But it is enough
I'm allergic to bees
So it's enough that it's
pretty bad
I also got another, I got a scrape from the stinger
on my leg from a dead bee in the pool
And that thankfully didn't swell up
But I got another one and I have no idea when I got it
It was just
I felt it, and that was it
Uh, go ahead Logie
Um, FU to uh
I guess I'm not agreeing so far away
Alright
And my FU goes to um
a couple things tonight, FU to Johnny Rockets
because I went there to eat the other day and it took like
25 minutes to get our food
Uh, and it wasn't even busy
But, and also FU to them because once the food finally
did fucking come, the burgers I had were fucking delicious
There were sliders, that's why I said burgers
I'm not that fat
Those sliders are fucking good
Have you had the orange
was it the orange dreamsicle shake
No, no
Like I'm actually trying to lose weight
right now, so Johnny
I had to cut back on something
No, no, you should not cut back on the orange dreamsicle shake
That is delicious
Oh, I, uh, yeah, so FU
Yeah, and FU to the fact that they derailed my diet
because that food is so delicious
Well, I don't know which Johnny Rockets you went to, but they have one
I'll say Arden Fairmaul
Well, they have a new one now that's across from the new
Palladio theaters
Oh, okay
Uh, yeah, I bet they didn't take
Well, see, if it took, like, if the place
was packed and busy, then I would understand why it would take so long
It was, like, empty, it was weird
So, anyway, FU did that
And FU did those burgers being delicious and making me want to go through that torture
again just to have them and screw up my diet
I've lost ten pounds in three months, almost
Nine pounds in three months
Get a bicycle and go riding with me
We live too far apart
to do that every day, especially this time of year
Alright, uh, and then
Oh, the other FU, I have one more FU
And then FU goes to, um, Salacious Pop
Not only for eliminating Pennywise from the list
But we went to the casino last night
I lost $20
This bitch puts, like, $5
in the slot machine and on his second pull
wins $70
Did he buy you dinner?
No!
But he did buy all the stuff at Target earlier that day
so I can't complain, I can't complain
He bought me a Hummingbird feeder because I wanted one
That's awesome
I know, I know
I know, at the end of the day
But I was really mad at the moment
Not really, though
Did you stomp your little foot?
I wasn't mad that he won, I was mad that I lost
and he won on his second pull
You should see how fast I went through $20
He was just gone in a snap, and then he's like
Oh, I think I'm winning, like, all this money
The coin thing keeps going
Do I get to keep all this?
Now you see why I don't like to gamble
Oh, I still love to gamble
I don't even play the lottery
I love gambling
It's a bad problem I have
Anyhow, let's move on to
a couple more news stories for you guys
and then the Skype line
as well as the results of tonight's list list
So let's do a couple more stories for you guys
Loki
You may remember a couple weeks back
we talked a little bit about people
that had games on
the Indie Games Store
on the Xbox Marketplace
were complaining that they just weren't getting enough exposure
and that the sales weren't very well
even for some of the top games on that service
Well, one of those companies
Z-Boy Games
they, of course, released
Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death 7
They now have put their games on Steam
and they're very pleased on how things are going
In fact, they're saying that
Z-Boy Games
has already made more revenue
in less than a week on Steam
than we have in over a year and a half
on Xbox Indie Games
That sucks
Well, it sucks for the Indie Games
but good for them that they're making money
Basically saying that they
decided, you know
because of this
that they're definitely looking at
launching more games on to Steam
versus, you know, the Xbox Indie Games service
And of course, you may remember
they also took donation support
That's a pretty big slap in the face
to Xbox Live Indie Games
and I think a pretty obvious showing
of how Steam's doing it right and Xbox
isn't doing it right when it comes to the Indie Games
but to be fair, there is a little bit of apples and oranges
going on here because
Steam, that really was
their only new release that week
whereas with Xbox Live, you still have all the
arcade games and all that stuff that they do have to promote
But, I'm not going to say I totally disagree
I think they should start featuring
some Indie Games in the main banner
once in a great while, especially these big ones
that do very well
If they would take the Indie Games
and say, have a certain release day
for those, and maybe
a little bit more quality control with the stuff that's released
You know, because I know with
WiiWare and stuff, you have blog sites
and everything that lists
And actually Kotaku's been pretty good about
they don't know
I don't know if they do all the Indie Games
that are released that week
or if it's just the ones that
they're playing or the ones
that they think are kind of cool
They'll do a thread every
week or so, pointing those out
and how much you can get them for
and the links to download them and that kind of stuff
I think that they should have something like that
where the Playstation Network comes out and says
Hey, here's what's releasing on our service
and not necessarily promoting them
but it's at least mentioning them
so people are aware of them
and granted, there's a lot of crap on there too
but
it's just, you know, there's something wrong
obviously, if they're making
more money on Steam
than they are in the Indie Games service
in less than a week
I mean, why would you waste your time on Indie Games
if you can just
put your game on Steam
and make that money in a week?
Yeah, that's kind of scary
but then again, if all
I mean, Xbox Live gets a lot
of Indie Games and these were obviously
two of the quality ones
If everything that went out on Xbox Live
went up on Steam, they wouldn't all sell as well
That's the difference
Well, yes, they wouldn't all sell as well
but the ones that people are actually putting effort into
and are considered hits on
the Indie Games service
aren't making that much money anyways
I guess that's true enough
Alright, let's go to
a story here about Akira Yamaoka
working with Suda51
He's, what they say, tag teaming
with Suda51 on the game development
This is during an interview on the
8-4 play podcast
Yamaoka talked a little more about what his
role is, besides just the chief
sound officer
Quote, at Grasshopper I'm creating sound
but not only sound, I'm the leader of the
development team, so I'm tag teaming with
Suda51, and I'm actually involved
with game creation as well as sound
He said that there are a few titles they're going
to announce soon, so stay tuned
There you go
By the way, I guess in this podcast
he also talked about how he almost quit
Konami after his first week
Be interesting to see
Alright
I'm all for more Akira Yamaoka
games
I'm glad he didn't leave the industry altogether
that he's still making games
Silent Hill just isn't the same without him
Uh, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangetownstory.com
There is a little bit of a buffer, so they're still on the last story
So let's just pop says, Steam Valve would probably
say no to 90% of the shit that
Xbox Live Indie games have in their store
Good, I think that they should
But who, see, who is it to determine quality?
Because I would say there's some shit
on Steam too
But one thing I do like about Steam
is that they provide quick links
to find reviews and so forth
And Metacritic, love it or hate it, their score
is right there
I think they only show it if it's above a certain score
though, because it's not there for every game
But kind of interesting nonetheless
Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line
at 1877 Game OLR
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
The Skype line is open now for your calls
If you want to give us a call
We're going to try to keep the calls probably a little brief tonight
It's extraordinarily long tonight
We're already at a three hour show
and we haven't even gotten into calls yet
So we're going to take those calls
Again, that's 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype
is OrangeLoungeRadio
Let's see if Loki has any last minute stories
Not much
They had a
Tekken Bowl, I guess, was released this week
for free on iOS
Which is kind of lame
Is that like bowling with Tekken characters?
Yes it is!
Oh, right, right, right
And actually, you're right, because they're going to be
featuring that as well in the
I guess, Tekken Tag HD
or whatever that they're doing
But yeah, you can download it for free
Getting it
Alright, our phone's ringing
so let's go to it
Hi, you're on the phone, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
Hey, it's the one and only Rama
Of course, what's up Rama?
A whole lot of stuff
Just stuff
What kind of stuff?
Love you too, Rob
Love you too
Well, what's up?
Well, first off
I was stoned off
off my tuchus last week
That's why I ended up with a Playstation 3
That's the first thing
You were stoned and you bought a Playstation 3?
I was so stoned off
my tuchus that the decision to buy one
was a good idea
Okay, so you bought a PS3
when you were high and you regret it now?
Actually, no
It's just an expressive blu-ray player like everybody else
says, but you know
It has a few good games on it
I know
LittleBigPlanet, I'm telling you
It's probably one of the greatest games of this generation
period on either console
It's in the queue
Alright, fair enough
Thank you
Now, about this whole
Capcom debacle
I'm probably the only
person that actually
feels that Capcom was in the right
to cancel the game
The only fuck-up was how they handled the whole
PR spin on the whole thing
I don't necessarily agree
that it was right, because I personally
am a fan of Mega Man Legends
but I am kind of trying to see it from their point of view
and I do understand the business perspective
If they don't make money, then it's not worth our time
But I do agree
that their biggest faux pas was how they handled it
Yeah
But defend yourself
a little bit to the fanboys
You're not even saying
like, you're just flattered saying
I agree with Capcom, they should just cancel it
Why?
In this age of money's getting kind of tight
a lot of these companies, as much money as they're making
we don't know how much of that is
revenue, profit, this or that
Who knows? If they invest a lot of money
in making this game
doesn't fit the bill
then they're out a lot of money
These companies really can't afford to do that
And what I find interesting is that
there's not that many Mega Man Legends fans out there
Granted, if you look at the online petition
there's so many fans
but most of them are just jumping on the bandwagon
just because they need a common cause to fight over
I will admit, I wonder how many of those people would actually
buy the game and how many are just wanting to pirate it
Because I had the first Mega Man Legends game
I'm not going to say it's crap
I thought it was a pretty good game
I didn't get the second one
because it wasn't
it was a good concept
but it just wasn't my cup of tea
Right
I kind of wish I could find the game again
I kind of want to play it
Is it on Playstation 3 download stuff?
I don't think it is
Anyway
I'm kind of surprised it wasn't
It might have drummed up more interest for a third one
Yeah, but
that's how it goes
Yep
So what about other stuff going on in Capcom's world
like the Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 news
How do you feel about that?
I'm amused that Phoenix Wright is in the game
That is kind of awesome
But is it $40 awesome?
I tend to think so
because I have to agree with what Rob D. said
They're rebalancing the characters
They're adding new stages
and adding more features and functionality to make it worth the $40
I mean, they kind of did the same thing
when they re-released Super Street Fighter 4
I mean, if they did the whole $59.99 price tag
I sure as hell would wait until it drops to $39
That's just me
Which is, I think, the price point they're going to try and put it out at
Mmhmm
Woah
Sorry, I dropped my phone
That wasn't good
I hope you have AppleCare on it
No, it's fine. No, and I don't have AppleCare either
It's just outside a year or two
So, no, it's fine. I'm good, we're good
Alright, anyhow
Well, on that note, anything else on your mind tonight?
Last thing, I don't know if you heard
but Sears has this massive video game clearance sale
at all of their stores
Oh, are they just unloading all of the video games altogether?
Yeah, but the thing is
your mileage may vary
because I've been hitting various stores
Like, I do know right now
most of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band bundles
are $20
Nice, Toys R Us did something like that
a couple weeks ago, and I do kind of want a new Guitar Hero bundle
Yeah, including the big Super bundles
I went to one Sears
I picked up Guitar Hero Metallica
for 96 cents, so I bought the last three
Holy shit
For the record, by the way
I don't know if you've got Big Lots
I think they opened one up
by me somewhere
We mostly have amazing savings
Dan picked up DJ Hero for me the bundle for $20
It was a couple months ago
but they get them in
and we found like a DDR there
for $20 with the pad and everything
Nice
I was thinking about picking up the DJ Hero 2 bundle
and sell the turntable
and find somebody that wanted a turntable
because I already have two
but nobody I know wants it
so I was like, there's no point in me buying it
because I refuse to sell to
the evil people, you know?
Right, right
I used to put it on Craigslist
It would be kinda hard too if you don't have the game, you know what I mean?
But you know how that rolls
Alright, well we're gonna let you go
so we can get some more calls
but thanks for calling, have a good one
Alright, bye-bye
Let's go to the phones
We got other calls coming in
Pick up the phone again
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Hey, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto
Hey Kaijuto, what's on your mind, buddy?
Not much, I'm gonna make it quick
So, what is it, Marvel 3 now?
Marvel vs Capcom 3 Ultimate, yes
Yeah, my thing is
Okay, so this new game
is supposed to have more content
than the original, right?
And the original is $60, right?
Right
And this new version is gonna be $40, right?
Yes
Why not make all of those fucking fighting games $40?
That's a great question
Why not make all the fucking fighting games $40?
I will say this though, when I was at the
place that I will not talk about anymore
I did see that they had dropped
the price of Marvel vs Capcom 3 to $40
But that certainly wasn't
its price new, originally
Yeah, I think
To me, when I think fighting game
I always think retro
So I always think that those games should be
low price, I never understood
the $60 for Street Fighter
I waited for
the second version of Street Fighter
It's dropped down to $30
Oh, then the place that shouldn't be named
is just overcharging now, what a surprise
I was recent, it was
Thursday, Friday
Okay, well I was there Saturday and they suck
But I want to say
this quickly though, since you brought up retro
I will bring up this
In 95, I think it was
when Street Fighter 2 came out for the
Super Nintendo, I remember dropping $70
on that game
I spent $65 on Killer Instinct
I mean, Super Nintendo games were expensive
a few years ago, which
inflation and all that means
it was probably more like $100 paid for that game
So, you can't
always say that fighting games have always been cheap
Yeah, that's for sure
But I mean, now I think they're kinda
You know, like I said
Whenever I think Street Fighter
or any of the other games, I'm always thinking
early 90s, I never think
oh, this is a new game, I always feel like it's a
rehash of something that I played
long ago, you know? I have no problem
with them, but I just think they were
But seriously, when Street Fighter 2 came out
it was the goddamn arcade
at home. I mean, that translation was
so fucking good of Street Fighter 2
Like, it was just, oh my god
It just blew our minds
Oh, yeah, I remember that
I remember the first time I ever played it on the Super Nintendo
I was like, oh shit, I got the
arcade machine in my house
I was like, freaking out
Anyhow, sorry
No problem
Yeah, you guys need to get on Minecraft
The pay version, try it
I really do not like Minecraft
I know, I tried, I tried
Well, at least it was the free version
But even Terraria
I didn't mean to cut you off, but the free version
is totally different from the pay version
Trust me, the pay version
We'll see, if I run out of the other games
that I have, maybe I'll check it out
But I tried playing Terraria
this week, it was okay
But I was like, oh wow, this really is
just Minecraft
Yeah, I kind of hit that too
I did play some in Minecraft
Oh well
Although Dan just showed me something interesting today
Someone created the whole middle earth
pretty much, in Minecraft
Including underground places
and the whole dwarven areas and whatnot
Yeah, when people take the time to do
that stuff, it actually comes out really interesting
So, that's pretty cool
Anyway, we lost Kaijuto
We did not hang up on him
The Skype connection crapped out
Does that mean, let me just check on the status
of the show, no, we're still streaming, so we're still up and running
So unfortunately, the Kaijuto
thing cut out, but
I hope you had a good night, and so on
I'm gonna go ahead and close up Skype, I think, tonight
So sorry to those of you that didn't get through, sorry it was a shorter
segment than usual, but we're running really long tonight
So, sorry about that
So we're gonna go ahead and wrap up the last minute story
so we can wrap up the show, so, Loki?
I got nothing
Well, alright then, Dark Soccer, anything?
Well, Salacious Pop brought up
that Capcom published Street Fighter Alpha 2
for the SNES
It was really sucky, and it had loading time
Oh yeah, it was like a Super Nintendo cartridge
with loading time I own it
I own it Yeah? Yeah
And no, I'm not gonna pay for Minecraft
I don't know, I might, when I run out of
other games to play, I'll kinda get to that
but, I still have so many games
I gotta beat, and then Minecraft seems like one of those
time sinks, you spend a lot of time, but I gotta admit
I would like to explore
I like exploring worlds, especially
recreations of stuff, so
like, if there's ways to go in
and explore that middle-earth stuff, that might be kinda fun
actually, that'd be kinda cool
Alright, well let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts
so we can close up shop for tonight, so
Loki, what's your
final thought tonight?
My final thought is
I can't wait till
Tuesday
I'm gonna go be brought
I better fucking bring Saints for the third
I'm gonna be very disappointed otherwise
cause we got like a bunch of people coming in
I know that we're, Ubisoft will probably
bring Just Dance 3 cause they brought
Just Dance 2 last year
THQ last year brought Smackdown vs.
Raw 11
but I think
you know, if they're bringing the biggest game
it's gonna be Saints for the third
and then of course, Microsoft will be there this year
which is kinda cool, and I know LucasArts
and the
Star Wars Connect game
so, lots of stuff to play
Well then good, I wanna hear your rundowns on it next week
so, my final thought is
this show ran long
and it's getting late
I'm getting hungry, so, it's time to go
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
I just texted Dan that I have hungers
and he needs to bring me my burger
You want a taco? Oh no, you want a burger
Well, Dan's bringing me a burger
I don't have to pay for a burger
I want a taco
Actually, I want a fish taco
Maybe tomorrow
