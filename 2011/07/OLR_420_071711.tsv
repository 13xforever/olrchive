13840	18789	Tonight, July 17th, 2011, another company is set to charge for online passes.
19129	21574	Could an old MMO be coming to the PS Vita?
21894	23817	And PopCap Games finds a buyer.
31448	38090	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38590	42431	It is July 17th, episode 420 of our show.
42911	46593	I'll just kind of leave that over there and let the jokes write themselves.
47213	57636	We are here to talk about video games on the show where every gamer has a voice and you can join us live every week, Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
58056	70949	www.allgames.com My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you with my co-hosts First off, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers Hey, how's it going, Jamie?
71249	72691	I don't know, I'm allergic So wasted
74275	74775	No, I'm not.
75636	79437	I'm high on coffee right now that DarkSakura brewed for me before the show.
79457	80277	It's like a special blend.
80317	80638	I like this.
80658	81618	I make excellent coffee.
81978	88041	I will tell everybody, it's half hazelnut, half chocolate macadamia, which is decaf.
88241	88861	And then marijuana.
89141	89241	No.
90522	94943	A teaspoon of Hershey's cocoa and a little bit of cinnamon.
95023	96264	Is coffee going to make me fat?
96924	97064	No.
97564	101686	Because keep in mind, cocoa does not really have any sugar in it.
103570	104751	Ah, okay, alright.
104851	107573	This is regular, like, the can of cocoa.
108473	111735	Is this an episode of Orange Lawns Radio or am I watching, like, Cooking with Paula Deen?
111755	113176	Because you are from the South, after all.
113877	113997	Ew.
115037	116238	That woman is frightening.
116818	118599	This woman... What's your problem with Paula Deen?
118620	119840	They photoshop her anyway.
120100	121761	They just, she just likes butter.
122122	126084	No, okay, look at every magazine cover and advertisement that she's on.
126504	126885	It's always...
128085	129946	This one, same smile.
130066	133707	It's like they take different pictures of her and just plaster the same face on her in Photoshop.
133767	138249	I was looking through my Facebook pictures not that long ago and I had kind of a similar smile in a lot of my pictures.
138289	139969	Like I tend to do that whole like, what?
140069	141310	But you're not Photoshopped.
141390	142150	You're right, I'm not Photoshopped.
142170	143070	To look like that.
143971	144311	All right.
144391	145511	I'm naturally that beautiful.
145531	146872	She looks like a wax sculpture.
147632	151453	She looks like she belongs in, what is it, Madame Trousseau's House of Wax or whatever.
151813	152054	Yeah.
152574	154314	But her sculpture would be made out of butter.
154414	155975	Maybe butter is a good preservative.
157047	160429	All right, look, we gotta also say hello to the one and only Techmaster, Loki!
161290	161530	Hi.
161650	163691	And I know Loki knows a thing or two about cooking with butter.
164511	166712	Yes, it's the best way to go.
167153	167753	Exactly.
168373	169094	So how are you, Loki?
169574	170134	I'm fine.
170314	171755	What's your dinner of choice tonight?
171795	172756	The listeners are dying to know.
172876	173716	It's pepperoni pizza.
173996	175437	Pepperoni pizza, good times.
175777	176338	I ate some.
177258	177658	It was good.
178079	185903	I was just craving pizza the other day because, well, we were talking about pizza and I was like, hmm, I want pizza.
187578	206868	Go to our chat room at chat.orangelandreda.com You guys can always join us and have your say in what's going on on this program Starting off with Breakman tonight Obviously the chatters are making their own little jokes about this being episode 420 And Breakman says, most podcasts don't last this many episodes You know, not to sound cocky, but you're right, a lot don't I mean, granted
207708	208388	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
226378	227778	There's definitely some that have made it there.
228719	232819	Any show that can get past 50 is a great accomplishment, if you ask me.
233400	237200	It takes dedication to get that far daily, weekly, no matter what you are.
238821	239501	We're happy to be here.
239621	245562	Thank you guys for joining us in chat every week, as you always do, whether you're high or not, to be listening to this program.
245882	247663	Thank you guys for always supporting us.
248203	249863	It's a wonderful, wonderful feeling.
250783	257525	I'm still having some warm fuzzies coming off of Under Sedation Live, which is another program here at All Games Radio on Saturday nights.
257665	261086	I was a guest on their 10th anniversary special, which aired last night.
261306	265348	And for those that don't know, that was a show I was on before Orange Lounge Radio.
265368	267208	DarkSakura was a guest many, many times.
267528	270469	You can go back and check out the archives of that show over at their website.
270849	274090	And yeah, it was a lot of fun to just sit in on that, just like good times.
274330	275911	And some folks that were listening to it said...
276351	276611	DarkSakura
306024	308646	I played WoW but really only to do my dailies.
309947	313849	Two more days and I'll be at another 150 marks in the damn world tree.
314069	317812	This is the whole new Fireland patch they put in that gave some good single player content.
317832	320613	One item level away from being able to do Firelands.
320814	321034	Nice.
321414	326257	So hopefully I can get one more good purple item and I'll be there.
327618	331240	I also played a lot of Peggle on my iPhone.
332140	341466	Just out of pure boredom and that, and every so often when I need something brainless to do, I play Peggle I also, what was it I was playing on Steam?
341806	355574	I was playing actually some more Droplets Because it's, again, another thing that I can kind of not really think about while I play And I'm not really all that great at it anyway, but it's kind of fun And then I played, crap, what else was it I was playing?
357734	358134	PS2 One is better.
386195	386975	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
406690	409212	Are those initial D-games on PS3 kind of faithful to the arcade?
409492	411714	Yeah, it's exactly like the one we have at Golfland.
411734	413855	Do you have to know a lot of Japanese to play those games?
414175	414395	Yes.
415016	415316	Damn.
415516	416997	However... Because I'm not very good.
417417	419799	Are there like translations on game FAQs?
420119	423761	Yeah, Dan has an FAQ and it even has the whole story mode translated and everything.
424321	425902	But when he got it, he didn't have any of that.
425942	433307	And thankfully, I could read just enough of it that I could say, okay, this one means you want to replay this.
433487	435907	Yeah, but you had a couple years of Japanese in college, right?
435928	438028	Yeah, I had just enough.
438448	447550	Like, I read like a retarded five-year-old in Japanese, so I had just enough in me that I could say, okay, that's what that says, that's what that says.
448030	458512	And then we sort of figured out, because I could read like half of some of the kanji in the tracks, so I was like, okay, that one's Irohazaka, that one's, you know, Akina, that one, so...
458772	461294	I got to say this in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
461795	465278	We've got Dark Tetsuya's in there saying, Rob, you mean Eurobeat?
465298	466278	Because I called it techno.
466579	471503	And yeah, the thing about Initial D especially is it has a very unique style of music that plays in the background.
471523	473865	If you've never heard Initial D music before, it sounds something like this.
479049	480971	Doesn't that make you want to run over people?
481678	484822	You've been in the car with me, driving to L.A.
485103	488527	While you're going 105 miles an hour, it is frightening.
488687	489468	In my old Lancer?
490790	493413	Well, now we had Dan driving, and guess what he wanted to listen to?
493954	494435	Eurobeat.
495456	497459	There is something about Eurobeat that makes you go faster.
497842	498423	Emo Para Emo Para?
498443	499363	That's goth dancing.
499383	500064	Exactly, but Para...
517529	524392	Now see, I'm a little partial to the music in Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune because it's not really Eurobeat.
524472	528434	It's more like just, I don't know what you, techno.
528454	529694	It's racing music.
529994	531575	It just makes me want to drive fast.
531635	532055	Listen to this.
534736	537277	You know what my song in that game is?
537317	538158	Yeah, kind of trance.
538438	541399	Was it Destination Blackout?
542059	543400	Or that's another Carpool song.
543500	543940	I don't know.
544640	545961	Then of course there's F-Zero music.
546081	546481	Oh God.
547331	548953	God, I miss F-Zero so much.
549013	550294	Nintendo, why do you hate me?
550934	554877	Well, I have just loaded you up with old school Bimani Rob.
555058	555318	Sweet.
555978	558260	Including some Parapara.
559882	560942	I'll be skipping that folder.
561503	564085	No, I put in like a few songs, but I'll also give you some poppin' music stuff.
564325	566467	So you can get your Desro on.
568268	569630	I never got into the poppin' music soundtracks.
569670	571491	It's fun to drive to Desro.
572432	573273	I'll take your word for it.
573313	574934	Alright, any other games you've been playing this week?
575726	578970	I've been playing, apparently I've been playing Kick Dan in his sleep.
580327	582328	How do you earn points in that game?
582809	584650	Whoever wakes up with the most bruises, I don't know.
584730	586631	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
587072	587672	Oh, and I swam.
588773	589333	I went outside.
589593	590914	That's not a game, Loki.
592235	593716	Yeah, especially going outside.
593756	595497	That's definitely not a game.
596038	597899	I played just basically two things.
598879	601161	Grand Theft Auto, you know, typical stuff.
601461	607805	Still playing through ranked death matches and the Battle of Gay Tony and kind of getting back in the groove of that.
608066	609346	And that didn't take me long.
610647	613429	and I've already got all my co-workers very frustrated at me.
614669	620752	And then I, of course, played a little bit of Earth Defense Horse Insect Armageddon because it's just awesome.
621433	622954	Still kind of grinding my way through that.
624354	626055	How long is that game?
626175	630017	Can you beat it in a few hours or is it a long story?
630037	630477	It's not very long.
630958	632939	It's a lot less missions than the first game.
632959	637121	The first game had these really stupid missions that kind of repeated themselves almost.
638061	639201	They had like 70 missions.
639221	639641	This one has 15.
640762	642662	But each mission is much longer.
644242	647663	I don't remember how long it took me to beat it, but it wasn't that long.
648303	651143	You could probably beat it in 10 hours.
652263	653284	Actually, not even 10 hours.
653364	654344	Probably a lot less than that.
655704	656384	Holy crap.
656404	657524	Guess what folder I just found.
658104	659405	All of Loki's old mixes.
660625	662205	Oh, all the remixes he used to do.
662265	663365	He hasn't made a mix in years.
663405	666666	Anyway, we don't want to deviate too much from games right now.
666706	667126	No, it's all right.
669467	693998	and then yeah so that's basically it was just playing those sweet yeah my gaming week let's see games I've been playing this week I'm still playing Final Fantasy 13 making my way through that I finally beat chapter 11 which I find is the point where most people say this game is awesome or a lot of my friends kind of got to chapter 11 and they're like this game opened up way too much and now some of the monsters can actually kill me I quit but
695318	697099	But I found Chapter 11 to be great.
697379	705321	And the trick is, folks, if you're stuck on Chapter 11, don't feel like it's like the rest of the game where you have to fight every monster you come in contact with.
705361	709543	In fact, many are better left avoided until you way level up your characters.
709943	715244	A lot of those Seath side quests that you can do, you really shouldn't do until towards the end of the game.
715284	718705	It's kind of comparable to Emerald Weapon from Final Fantasy VII.
718725	720946	You really weren't supposed to do that until after the end.
721366	722487	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
744241	746062	Oh my god, that was a badass cinematic.
746082	746822	They kicked off Chapter 12.
747082	751803	I don't want to spoil too much of the story, but you'll figure out pretty quickly who the Eidolons are.
751843	752643	They're like the Summons.
753044	755164	They are all involved in the opening.
755204	758765	Imagine Summons mixed with a scene out of Tron Legacy.
759205	762386	That was the opening to Chapter 12, and it was so hot.
762606	764547	I had to fan myself after it was over.
764587	766608	I've gotten to that point, but I don't remember.
767348	768428	It's really far in.
768488	769228	You would remember.
769748	771529	It was an amazing cutscene.
771869	773431	So yeah, now I'm at that point.
773832	774873	Is that before the game?
775273	778297	That's way after it opens up.
778677	783804	Chapter 11 will take you as long as five chapters did from the Kukui stuff.
783824	788990	Yeah, maybe because I was wasting my time just doing all the side quests because I can.
790912	806626	uh yeah so that was uh that was you know Final Fantasy 13 I'm probably poured like 40 hours into that now I know I've been talking about that game even though it's like a year and a half old like the past four weeks but I understand I you know can only put so many hours in in a week and I just recently picked it back up again but I'm hoping in the next couple weeks I'll have it beat
807246	807566	DarkSakura.com
829611	830011	DarkSakura.com
858946	876135	I was playing on the 360, a couple new games that I picked up Best Buy was having a buy one get one sale on Kinect Games So I got a late birthday present from Salacious Pop of Child of Eden Finally got to play that game And Your Self Fitness, I think, is that the Ubisoft fitness game?
876315	877715	Your Self Fitness, that's what it's called, right?
878376	881477	The most well received of the Kinect Fitness games is the one we got
883358	884199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
904096	904556	Thanks for watching!
926587	932769	That could be my own bad, but the game also didn't explain it to me very well how I could really make sure I register that on the beat.
933089	935089	Now the good thing is you can play with Kinect or controller.
935409	940591	So after playing it a little bit with Kinect, I switched to the controller and played through a couple stages.
941111	943871	And I like the controller responsiveness quite a bit more.
944011	950053	And the game itself, it's basically Rez, but I'm going to admit I didn't like the music quite as much.
950873	953954	I like that there's more elements to the game, and I think the game is very...
954474	955635	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
972346	972847	and DarkSakura.com.
994525	997648	Yeah, otherwise, I think as a Kinect game, it's certainly a lot of fun.
997668	999010	I think it's one I would show people.
999430	1005937	But yeah, that sensitivity, music, firing mechanism thing, I would love if there was like...
1007153	1013396	A clicker or something I could hold in my hand while I'm doing it to allow something tangible that's more precise.
1014097	1018139	But I don't really know how you would do that, and it kind of takes away from what the Kinect is all about.
1018719	1023101	But you know how when you're using the Wiimote, you at least still have a button in your hand?
1023622	1027624	I hate to say it, but I almost think this game might be a little better with the Wii controls.
1028864	1029165	Yikes.
1029385	1029685	I don't know.
1030285	1032106	So that was just my thoughts on it.
1032266	1035568	So then you would probably want to play the PlayStation 3 version with the move controls.
1037828	1038609	Yeah, actually.
1039130	1041492	I think the move might actually be better for this.
1042012	1052523	But again, I am very much about I need the precision with a music game, and I don't feel like moving my hand forward or flicking my hand, especially when the Kinect is not a perfect system.
1052883	1056667	If you're not playing it in the perfect environment, it doesn't recognize you always.
1056707	1059390	And that was some of the problems I had with the other game I played, your self-fitness.
1059870	1060090	Like...
1060811	1067853	But it may work better though now with that new accessory that's coming out, the Kinect Zoom thing from Nyko.
1068154	1069094	That might be a little bit better.
1069214	1070074	That might be better.
1070094	1073435	And it might, you know, again, at least the Kinect is better than the iToy was.
1073475	1076476	Like the iToy, my God, that technology never worked right.
1076876	1081098	But I feel Kinect is like, it's still a step above, but it's got a long way to go.
1082499	1085322	The technology isn't perfect, but these games are still pretty early.
1086243	1090727	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelunchradio.com, Zether says, I heard that Child of Eden didn't sell good.
1091588	1098134	Apparently it only sold about 30-some-odd thousand copies, which didn't really even put it in the top 20 of games that were sold last month.
1098695	1106242	I don't know, maybe Loki knows more about what sales ultimately mean and so forth, but I honestly think what probably scared a lot of people off were these reviews talking about
1106642	1109343	It's a 90-minute game, and you're paying $60 for it.
1109783	1115125	I'm hoping that this game will sell much more when it gets discounted, because I think it's one of the better Kinect games.
1115145	1115926	It's just a niche game.
1115986	1118627	I mean, Rez and stuff, that was a niche game.
1118647	1124009	And unfortunately, it's a niche that we like, but it's a niche game, and that's the problem.
1124049	1125429	I mean, it's just like Earth Defense Force.
1125469	1126770	Earth Defense Force didn't sell...
1127350	1148859	that great either but if Child of Eden had Britney Spears music in it it was sold 10 times as many copies right it would have been stupid though and then actually no I don't think it would have sold 10 times as many copies I think still people wouldn't give it a chance and even less copies would have been sold because people have been like you know like us but I'm not touching that shit what the hell is this um but yeah like Earth Defense Force it sold uh
1150347	1162357	I think they estimated like 65,000 to 90,000 copies worldwide, which is fine because the launch quantities of that were only about 200,000 per platform.
1162417	1164939	So they're expecting to sell much.
1165179	1169002	They know going into it what they're expecting to get out of it.
1169582	1171604	And a game like Child of Eden...
1172945	1185862	I don't think, development-wise, it didn't cost as much money to put it together as, say, a Modern Warfare game or something like that, where you have to sell a lot more to make up the money.
1185902	1186103	I mean...
1187505	1190067	I don't think that they had really huge expectations for it.
1190127	1190907	Yeah, true, true.
1191007	1191528	That's a good point.
1192809	1195730	So I'll quickly talk about the fitness game I played.
1195870	1198992	Your Shape Fitness, Your Self Fitness, I don't know, one of those fitness games.
1199453	1200413	The one from Ubisoft.
1200513	1208338	And I really liked the idea of the whole tailored custom to you individual workout thing.
1208458	1209339	I liked that.
1209859	1210059	But...
1212400	1218842	I didn't like how the Kinect, again, doesn't really recognize you 100% of what you're doing.
1219222	1222823	Because this game grades you pretty rigidly on the exercises you're doing.
1223463	1230325	And if you're not perfect within the box that it has, and your arms go way too out, you don't get credit for stuff.
1230345	1234586	And it can be very frustrating, especially when the exercises are kind of kicking your butt a little bit.
1235206	1236887	It was having me do these squats.
1237487	1259089	and the other thing I'm going to actually say I thought was terrible about this I truly think it was a bad decision to do this in a fitness game is when it was doing the calibration stages and having me warm up it did not start with a stretch activity and I think that is a very poor thing to do in a fitness game actually you want to warm up before you stretch
1261620	1261900	Really?
1262140	1262901	Yes, actually yes.
1263301	1267962	Because you have to warm up the muscles before you stretch or else you run a risk of pulling a muscle.
1268162	1278645	I think if you saw what this game was doing though, some of the high intensity exercises it was doing, it's one thing to put a little flash card up on the screen saying, you should stretch before using this device.
1278785	1286867	I honestly think a smarter little thing would have said, okay, let's do some swaying in place, a little jogging.
1287268	1288548	Now we're going to stretch.
1289228	1291509	Now we're going to have you do the intensive squats and so forth.
1291529	1293490	Do they have a stretching portion at all?
1293990	1299453	Not that I ran into, but keep in mind this game kind of kicked my butt before I got very far into it.
1300093	1301334	I'd like to see it.
1301614	1306896	I've been sore in my legs for four days since playing, and it's because Stupid Me didn't stretch beforehand.
1307296	1312439	And I was a little bit upset that the game should have... I mean, I should have known better, yes.
1312919	1316921	I'm not going to totally blame the game, but I just think it was a bad idea to...
1317381	1318822	to not encourage me more.
1318902	1319582	Remind me.
1319662	1320302	Hey, stupid.
1321683	1323984	Not everyone knows that you need to stretch beforehand.
1324084	1333748	And I didn't think it was going to throw me so far into it with the calibration where I'm doing some squatting and things that are going to hurt my legs before telling me, hey, maybe we should do some yoga first.
1333988	1334868	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1355094	1361217	And I just, and again, I want to clarify before, because this might show up later in the game, so I want to be very careful on what I'm saying.
1361617	1371981	I was going through an initial setup calibration mode, but it was having you do exercises as part of the calibration, like a full routine type of thing, and it did not have me stretch beforehand, nor did no reminder come up at any point.
1372381	1380985	And, you know, maybe after the calibration, when you get into the actual daily stuff, you'll see more of that, but I'm not going to, if I didn't see it beforehand...
1381565	1383146	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1399594	1405720	It makes all the difference with how well you can keep up with the exercises too if you've given your chance to warm up and then stretch.
1407462	1411046	I like this comment from Kai Judo in our chat room.
1411146	1413409	You do the stretch when you try to get the game out of the shrink wrap.
1415458	1415958	That's true.
1416258	1418219	Some of those shrink wraps are pretty terrible.
1418259	1420020	But my arms don't hurt.
1420520	1421300	It's my legs.
1422001	1423181	I'm telling you guys, for real.
1423521	1424182	And it's sad.
1424262	1425962	Okay, I'm a teacher, right?
1426443	1428043	Not a kid teacher, but an adult teacher.
1428083	1429404	I teach in a corporate environment.
1429684	1437187	But I use classrooms full of computers, and I walk around and look at adults on their systems all day long, making sure they're following with me and so forth.
1437227	1438507	So I have to walk around the room.
1439048	1442849	The day after I did this Connect exercise, I couldn't walk as much.
1443249	1444510	And I'm having to explain to my class,
1444870	1448116	Yeah, sorry guys, I was playing Kinect yesterday and you know, those things are pretty rough.
1448136	1451803	Like, how embarrassing is that?
1452885	1454247	Fool, you should have known to stretch.
1454798	1457499	You know, it used to happen to me when I would go play DDR on my lunch break.
1458340	1460661	And I'd come back, my knees hurt.
1461041	1463542	And like, I had to... Walking upstairs was not a problem.
1463622	1466123	Walking downstairs, oh my gosh.
1466283	1470265	I felt like a little old lady clutching to that railing.
1471566	1472446	I should have used the elevator.
1472486	1474507	It's like you're doing squats all over again.
1474667	1476628	It's easier to lift it than to drop to it.
1476748	1477868	It was traumatic.
1478449	1478629	But...
1479429	1485856	I'm not going to give up and I'm not going to say a lot of negative things about the game because of that one thing.
1486016	1491322	I'll know next time to stretch, but I really think the game should have incorporated it better.
1491422	1497829	If I missed it, and I consider myself a pretty smart individual, if I missed it, who knows who else is missing this and hurting themselves.
1502070	1502670	No, not about that.
1502910	1503231	Oh, okay.
1503271	1507872	It's actually something that came up in my video game week that I didn't get to play because of a certain something.
1508352	1508552	Sure.
1509152	1509992	Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
1510012	1510612	It just occurred to me.
1510752	1511132	That's okay.
1511152	1512553	That was the last game I wanted to talk about.
1512813	1516973	The arcade that had Parapara Paradise is out of business.
1517974	1522095	The Arcadia budding games or whatever it's called, the kind of crappy ghetto.
1522115	1523495	Oh, the little crappy, yeah.
1523655	1524835	But they had the Parapara machine.
1524875	1526736	I'm not surprised at all they went out of business.
1526756	1527196	They're gone.
1527296	1528316	It really was a matter of time.
1529036	1532898	I wanted to go play Parapara because I don't have Dance Masters.
1532918	1534559	Their location really was never that good.
1535620	1539982	But we should buy that place and open up the actual Orange Lounge arcade in batting cages.
1540002	1541683	That would be great.
1541703	1542443	I bet it's dirt cheap.
1543484	1548446	Anyhow, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungevideo.com Derek H is in our chatroom saying, Rob is correct.
1548826	1553489	Even Carmen Electra's aerobic striptease workout DVDs have an extensive stretching section.
1554329	1554590	See?
1555432	1561305	And even if your pole dancing classes tell you, I don't know why Derek H. knows so much about pole dancing classes, but I'll just assume he does.
1562428	1563891	Even if they're getting you to stretch.
1565222	1570826	You know that these games need to make sure they are incorporating that into their customized workouts.
1571346	1571586	All right.
1572307	1574028	Anyhow, let's move on.
1574168	1575369	That's it for our Gaming Weeks.
1575429	1576390	Quickly, housekeeping.
1576670	1579192	Make sure you follow us on all those great websites around the interwebs.
1579252	1583695	Twitter.com slash OLR or Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1585016	1587457	They kick businesses off of Google Plus right now.
1587537	1589018	So we are not on Google Plus.
1590179	1590940	You can follow...
1591380	1592801	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1611212	1612333	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1641072	1657456	Uh, we're starting off with a comment from, uh, one of the Sony Network Entertainment execs, the president, Tim Schaaf, who, uh, spoke to, uh, or spoke at GamesBeat, uh, 2011, uh, about the PlayStation Network downtime.
1657976	1658276	And they said,
1668278	1673360	So, just goes to show you, all those people are like, you know, they're done for.
1674200	1677841	They ended up selling a lot more because of this.
1679202	1684403	And then it says, of course, you know, the downtime cost Sony approximately $171 million.
1684423	1688744	You know, they would not like to do it again, obviously.
1688784	1691765	They said one time was enough, but it was a great learning experience.
1691805	1692206	We agree.
1693206	1693326	So...
1694781	1696903	That was a very interesting choice of words.
1697383	1701967	It was a learning experience, but once is enough.
1702087	1706751	If that isn't the most politically correct statement about the whole thing.
1706791	1712596	He had to explain a little bit because his first quote was, it was a great experience.
1713277	1716700	No, that's not exactly how you would describe that.
1716720	1717561	Yeah.
1717981	1720482	A humbling experience might be a little bit better.
1722003	1725404	Do you know how many times in my day-to-day job I use a phrase like that?
1725824	1727705	You know, because people make mistakes all the time.
1727745	1729546	And, you know, it's frustrating to make mistakes.
1729586	1733667	You want to, especially when you're at your job, you want to do the best job you possibly can.
1733687	1734868	But a lot of times people make mistakes.
1736208	1737569	It's a learning experience.
1737609	1738889	We have to learn from it.
1738909	1740050	And we make mistakes in here.
1740090	1740510	It's okay.
1740890	1743831	This is very funny to hear Sony kind of use that same phrase.
1744585	1746206	This was a learning experience.
1747146	1748306	Yeah.
1748586	1754349	But they are planning to invest some money to make sure that the PlayStation Network is secure.
1754429	1767833	They're committing $20 million, and they're also seeking out independent developers to create games like, you know, PixelJunk, Sidescroller, and the Papoio Boku stuff.
1768614	1770614	They're also saying that they're going to be...
1772956	1789015	doing this pub fun to bring innovative different and unique gameplay to the PlayStation Network so they're kind of trying to beef up their content on there because it could use a little bit of beefing up so that's kind of cool
1792816	1796399	Yeah, I'm glad they're kind of bringing in all that extra support.
1797500	1809631	Also, I think all this talk about how Google was going to go under, or I'm sorry, not Google, excuse me, I'm still thinking about Plus and all that, but how PlayStation was going to go under and all that after the hacking and all that, it seems to be...
1811371	1835776	A distant memory at this point, and I'm looking at a comment in our chatroom from Blender, says Uncharted 3 beta had 1.53 million players, by the way, and I do remember reading about that on the internet earlier this week, and I think a story had said it's the biggest PlayStation beta that's ever happened, so it certainly gives the impression that people have pretty much forgiven Sony, and we've all moved on with our lives, and we're back on PlayStation Network, but
1837421	1841382	There's also, I guess, that sense of fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
1841442	1846744	Like if something bad happens again, I think you'll see a lot of people really mean it this time and leave.
1847384	1849825	Of course, it also helps that, you know, it's Uncharted 3.
1850385	1851506	It's a huge game.
1852006	1855047	So, of course, it's going to be one of their largest betas they've ever had.
1855587	1857528	So, there you go.
1858820	1859440	David Reeves said,
1881713	1889557	That there is a resurgence in people buying the generic PSN cards in retail stores rather than putting up their credit card details.
1890098	1897562	I think in the future they will make more non-generic cards like game branded ones such as Street Fighter or FIFA or even Modern Warfare.
1897842	1899423	But the generic ones have done well.
1899963	1903085	People are playing it a bit safe at the moment because the hackers will be back.
1903165	1904345	That's my personal opinion.
1904485	1905246	I mean they will right?
1907148	1909769	I don't know if that's really the best thing to be saying there.
1909989	1913711	Oh, shut up, Capcom.
1913751	1915912	We see that they're buying more generic cards.
1916312	1921435	Yeah, hopefully they're not buying your games with your crappy DRM shit.
1921875	1927818	Oh, your games didn't work during the whole PlayStation Network outage, or at least your two PlayStation Network games.
1928260	1933242	Those are awfully pretty good spirits to be in when you consider they missed out on all those weeks of sales, you know.
1933922	1936063	I'm kind of surprised it wasn't.
1936083	1940685	I mean, granted, that might be one quote out of a much larger interview, but still.
1940705	1944127	It's because they need them more than Sony needs them, you know.
1945407	1952830	Because if they, you know, stop supporting Sony, then their sales kind of get cut about half.
1953531	1956712	Whereas if Sony loses them, eh, there's
1956732	1958213	We haven't really wanted anything else, but Dan got the freebies.
1981058	1981939	Yeah, I got the freebies.
1981959	1983620	I don't know if I've bought anything on PSN.
1983640	1991668	I try not to buy anything on there, not because I'm afraid of my credit card information being hacked, but because I don't want to spend money on their network.
1992589	1994030	And that goes for Microsoft, too.
1994270	2002338	I don't really want to buy anything, because I got into the habit where, oh, I gotta buy all the Xbox Live Arcade games, and I did that for a while, and
2004593	2005994	How many of them do I play now?
2006554	2009196	None of them.
2009856	2016139	The last thing I bought on there, I think, was the Pirates of the Caribbean expansion for LittleBigPlanet.
2016599	2018881	That was the last thing that I purchased on there.
2019001	2023323	Honestly, I don't see myself really purchasing anything else for there.
2024424	2024904	You never know.
2027977	2028857	I don't know.
2029978	2034281	If I'm going to purchase download content for something, most of the time I'm gaming on my 360 anyway.
2036642	2053313	I don't think I've bought anything since the hack happened, but I will say that Salacious Pop is strongly encouraging me to get the Arcade Super Street Fighter Arcade Edition expansion there on PlayStation Network because that's where we own Super Street Fighter 4.
2054174	2055655	I may have to buy something in the near future.
2055695	2056035	We'll see.
2057956	2059157	Alright, let's move on.
2059237	2060017	One more gaming news.
2060077	2061238	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
2062298	2064039	Well, I have some Ubisoft news.
2064419	2069421	They have confirmed that there is going to be an online pass to be used for its games.
2069481	2071202	It's called the Uplay Passport.
2071842	2081247	And it's $9.99, basically $10 for access to the online features of many of their core games when bought second-hand.
2082567	2089795	So, if you bought the game, you have a registration code that comes in it and it has exclusive bonus content and whatnot.
2090216	2092919	But the first game that's going to be using this is Driver San Francisco.
2093940	2095021	No UK price yet.
2098465	2098846	Alright.
2099186	2101609	Well, Loki, aren't you excited to hear about this?
2103154	2108316	You know, it's just another company jumping on this horrible bandwagon, and I don't see the point.
2108917	2118461	And I was trying to find... There was another article that actually had their press release for that in there, and I really want to find that so that I can... Oh, here we go.
2119381	2122503	So they can read you their PR spin on this, and it's just...
2124564	2125865	It's what gamers want.
2127186	2132531	Gamers want that premium experience that their $10 goes to help.
2135293	2136615	Let's see.
2136715	2139397	I'm trying to find... God, I really wish I had it.
2142290	2151676	Basically, they spun it as, it allows us, it's extra content, like online multiplayer and stuff like that.
2152517	2166467	I'm sorry, if I'm buying a game that has online multiplayer in it, and that does, because it does brand new, so therefore it should use, I don't understand why I should have to pay extra if I'm buying used.
2167127	2170930	Now, I've heard people make, and I gotta say the most...
2172114	2173895	Thank you for watching!
2189799	2191721	All used games start off as new at some point.
2191881	2197185	So, they've made their money for that game to fund that online network.
2197285	2204131	I have to be devil's advocate and give you the counterpoint, but if the game wasn't being sold used, then that would force someone to buy it new.
2204431	2206974	Not necessarily, because some people might not buy it
2207594	2209096	They may just skip it altogether.
2209396	2216503	And whereas if you got a used sale, you may have the chance that other people might enjoy that game and they may later on decide, hey, you know what?
2216703	2221048	I'm going to go pick up more games from this developer or whatnot.
2222305	2228633	And on top of all that, people say that the developer doesn't get money for used sales.
2229113	2233759	Well, it doesn't matter because the developer already got paid when the game got pressed.
2234740	2238545	Yeah, they get some kickbacks for sales and stuff like that, but you know what?
2239186	2240027	It doesn't matter...
2242129	2242950	Thanks for watching!
2256192	2258854	Going to our chat room for some comments at chat.orange.com.
2258894	2261356	Sterlok says, cool, more games I'm not buying.
2262037	2266201	DarkTetsuya says, they fuck us over and for whatever reason people still step up to defend them.
2266581	2269884	Okay, well, I'm not necessarily defending this here, but I have to...
2273667	2276449	A lot of this news story I just kind of roll my eyes at and I'm like, I don't care.
2276549	2279250	Because I really do buy most of my stuff new.
2279731	2283433	Like either I'm going to buy it new or I'm going to get it on one of those rental accounts.
2283873	2290257	And there are very few games that I would play online that I wouldn't just buy new.
2290958	2294740	Most games I want to play online with friends I'm excited about and I want to buy them right away.
2295040	2297341	But you're not seeing the writing on the wall, Rob.
2297361	2299182	You see, if you give them an inch, they're going to take a mile.
2299722	2307045	If you start thinking that this is an okay thing for them to do, then everybody jumps on board and they start doing this for multiplayer.
2307305	2307825	Then you know what?
2307845	2315088	Then they start going, hey, you know, we're noticing that it seems that our used game sales or whatever, our new sales, aren't really being impacted enough.
2315349	2323652	We need to make sure that this is really something that people are going to want to buy new by adding more content for this game.
2323792	2324553	Thanks for watching!
2341824	2346928	Now, you can't wait until later on when they're like, oh, well, it doesn't matter because I buy a lot of games new.
2347269	2350311	Yeah, until they start saying, oh, hey, you know what?
2350772	2356176	We can make a lot more money by charging for online multiplayer by having it download content or something.
2356316	2358759	I will say it does piss me off.
2359019	2363583	And this is interesting because I do kind of have different opinions depending on what system it is.
2364003	2365464	I kind of think the PlayStation 3...
2366425	2366725	DarkSakura.com
2389227	2409356	and I refuse to support it on Xbox and I will take Microsoft to task for that because Microsoft's allowing it to happen by selling it on their store and I'm sorry that's double dipping you're charging me twice for the same thing and that is to play my game online so I honestly think the company that needs to put their foot down is Microsoft Sony
2410316	2425770	they're providing a free service it's harder to get mad at them on that side because you aren't paying for online over there the whole infrastructure is free and to say that to charge $10 for maintenance you can get away with that a lot more on that end than you can on Microsoft's end
2426030	2426310	Outro Music
2448384	2450525	For the record, just because Eason wanted to hear it.
2450925	2451085	Sure.
2451385	2451985	OBJECTION!
2452905	2464109	Well, and then, I mean, it's like I've said before, and you know, no one seemed to care then, and it's happening more now, and yeah, it doesn't really bother me too much because I don't buy Wii games, but...
2465309	2478513	There's a lot of Wii games out there nowadays that, you know, maybe music games, maybe, you know, I don't know, just some other type of game, but where they're charging $60 for it.
2478773	2479553	No one's saying anything.
2479733	2480193	So you know what?
2480213	2482094	This is something that's now commonly happening.
2482914	2496550	Um, like, for example, and, I mean, not that, this is definitely not a game I'm buying, but, you know, like, that Spyro fucking game that's coming out, the, the new Spyro Skylanders Adventure bullshit thing, that they're selling some S-
2498292	2499093	Thanks for watching!
2518132	2518712	and DarkSakura.com
2539827	2541188	Oh, those horrid things.
2541828	2542489	Yes, I know.
2542909	2547594	Listen, kids are starting out stupid early on, and they just become stupid adults.
2548074	2548294	I know.
2548314	2549936	I hope Richard Gere doesn't own a Zuzu.
2553322	2554343	Yeah.
2554723	2557405	So, it's just dumb.
2557525	2563490	And they're trying all these different tactics to get money for things they really shouldn't be getting money for.
2563950	2565492	Developers getting money for used games?
2565792	2566132	Fuck it.
2566172	2567573	You shouldn't get money for used games.
2568514	2568894	That's it.
2569055	2569695	It's a market.
2570055	2572998	It's just a market that was created by people.
2573158	2574899	And it doesn't even have to be necessarily that.
2575280	2579383	Let's say, for example, Rob, I loan you a copy of my game and you want to play it online.
2579623	2580063	You can't.
2580103	2580824	You have to pay $10 now.
2580864	2581064	Mm-hmm.
2583703	2583943	Why?
2584404	2587087	Oh, because it's someone else accessing their network.
2588629	2590751	And I've already paid for that on Xbox Live.
2591011	2591232	Yes.
2592773	2593014	So...
2593757	2596298	They just use the more subscription model based thing.
2596318	2599580	But I'm telling you, I've been an Xbox Live member for like six, seven years.
2600080	2602161	If they allow this shit to continue, I'm out.
2602921	2603982	You know what I mean?
2604022	2607023	There will come a point probably where there's a game I'm going to want to play online.
2607043	2610825	I'm going to be pissed that I'm double dipping and I'm canceling Xbox Live when that happens.
2610845	2616507	If Sony is doing it, if Ubisoft is doing it, EA is doing it, THQ is doing it, Warner Games is doing it...
2619873	2624755	It's not going to be long before everybody jumps on board with this, and hopefully not Microsoft.
2624815	2626035	Interesting comment from Ranma.
2626055	2627656	Well, okay.
2628536	2633138	If Microsoft did it, now they need to be called out if that happens.
2633418	2633958	Oh, my God.
2634038	2634538	All right, anyway.
2634998	2636959	Ranma in our chatroom at chat.org.com.
2637179	2640840	You know, if you're patient enough, you can buy the games as new when the price drops.
2641300	2643421	Not that serious to get the game on day one.
2643481	2648263	I'd rather wait a few weeks for the game to drop to 30, 40 new than wait a week and buy it used for 45, 50.
2649463	2650024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2664188	2669211	That is technically a way to get it cheaper, but people want their games right away.
2669472	2674315	But, you know, the way I look at it is if you're buying it used anyways, you're probably not getting it day one anyways.
2674375	2676456	So just wait even longer.
2676496	2679959	In a game like Driver, I mean, let's look at Driver.
2680159	2682721	I mean, the pedigree of Driver hasn't been that great.
2683141	2683921	The first one was great.
2684302	2685142	Second one was alright.
2685622	2686943	Third one was terrible.
2687424	2690025	And the fourth one, eh, kind of terrible as well.
2690165	2693668	So the fifth one, eh, I wouldn't be surprised if it's terrible.
2694809	2697192	And it's definitely not a game I'd be playing online anyways.
2699695	2706885	Alright, let's move on with some other topics here before we make Loki's head explode.
2707864	2708405	Thanks for watching!
2725660	2741229	No mention of Final Fantasy XIV That just doesn't exist But Final Fantasy XI Their only online game In the Final Fantasy series Will be Possibly ported to the PlayStation 8 Their only online game?
2742329	2743630	in the Final Fantasy series.
2744210	2744450	What?
2745951	2748472	Did they just totally forget about Final Fantasy XIV?
2748492	2750833	No, no, no, that's my comments.
2750873	2751953	Oh, I see, I see, okay.
2752693	2753694	XIV doesn't exist.
2754294	2754774	I see.
2756055	2766739	No, it's just, it's kind of interesting though if they did that, but I think it'd be kind of cool because think about it, you know, MMOs haven't really come to handhelds, so...
2767159	2768459	Yeah, not that I can think of.
2768660	2769660	Or maybe Phantasy Star.
2769680	2770400	Phantasy Star, maybe.
2770420	2775202	Well, actually, but the Phantasy Star portable games contained little single-player games.
2775242	2777902	They were a lot like Universe's single-player mode.
2778643	2781884	So, yeah, I'd like that.
2782004	2783164	I'd welcome that, actually.
2783484	2786285	I hear Final Fantasy XI is still going.
2786325	2787125	It's still improving.
2787405	2788766	They did graphical improvements.
2789086	2793407	If you're a PC player, you got some new graphic textures this last go-around.
2793447	2794808	So I think that's kind of rad.
2798250	2810821	I don't think it's really possible to put XIV on a portable platform because despite the fact that everybody criticizes it for being poop it was a really good looking game and the Vita probably just doesn't possess the power graphically to pull it off.
2811281	2838579	but you know 11 was a game that was made for the PS2 and that's the biggest drawback to 11 is that everything they do on 11 still has to support the PlayStation 2 because a lot of folks in Japan that's how they adopted it was on the PS2 so until there comes a day where they say well we no longer are going to support the old platforms I just don't see them being able to do that I think that's what 14 was trying to do but failed miserably because they didn't make the they tried to change the core game
2839520	2848299	and they took out the goddamn auction houses which every MMO like needs so I don't, oh my god and they kept the same races but changed the names that's just stupid
2850010	2856295	So anyway, I think it's a neat idea to have, especially considering the Vitas are supposed to have 3G in them and everything.
2856375	2858256	I think that's kind of a cool use.
2858836	2861518	I would be curious what other types of MMOs come out of this.
2861618	2865261	Maybe not just ports of old stuff, but some new ideas.
2865461	2870845	Especially because isn't part of the whole Vitas thing supposed to be finding gamers around you?
2871145	2879411	Well, yeah, you've got GPS built into them and all the different little services that they have and stuff.
2879642	2880843	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2903580	2909741	I don't know, it just sounds like a neat thing to kind of integrate the GPS stuff into MMOs somehow.
2909881	2910202	I don't know.
2911882	2918123	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Spazinator says, Final Fantasy XI would be a system seller.
2918243	2919884	I used to love it on the PlayStation 2.
2920884	2923365	Tigerclaw says, MMOs on a PlayStation Vita.
2923725	2929446	I sense you can do some sort of transferring type of stuff from the PlayStation 3 to the Vita with MMOs.
2930306	2934089	It's very hard to play Final Fantasy XI on a PlayStation 3.
2934949	2942034	You could do it, but you have to have the exact right model of PlayStation in order to be able to play it.
2942054	2942495	I do.
2943795	2945717	It's not even just the backward compatible ones.
2945837	2953062	There's one that has some type of port that the hard drive attaches to because I don't think you can use PlayStation 3's hard drive.
2953422	2954482	For 11, can you?
2954502	2977888	I can't remember No, you can't at all because it's a 3.5 drive versus a laptop SATA drive And it's an old IDE drive So you would have to clone Well, I think they had something that you could download off the PlayStation Network That was basically the cloned hard drive information, I think, for the Final Fantasy XI stuff
2979178	2981640	This is a curious comment from Spazinator in our chatroom.
2997413	3002858	Are the Vita launch games really that bad looking so far?
3003859	3005040	How old is Final Fantasy XI?
3005060	3006541	It's about as old as this show, isn't it?
3006561	3009064	I think it came out in 2002 in Japan, right?
3009124	3009284	Yes.
3009924	3010825	It's a nine-year-old game.
3010945	3011506	Let me put it this way.
3013727	3016929	Launch titles right now are pretty sparse.
3017489	3020711	They haven't really said what they're launching with yet.
3021491	3022492	Other than Uncharted.
3023132	3024953	Uncharted is a big title for them.
3025173	3025393	Of course.
3025473	3029655	And there was that neat looking dungeon game with the whole PlayStation 3 integration I thought was neat.
3032577	3033297	But that's about it.
3033317	3036119	They haven't really said yet what a lot of launch games are going to be.
3036599	3037659	It's still really early, I think.
3038400	3038540	Right.
3039482	3040843	Vita, Naughty Dog, Crash Bandicoot
3060663	3081284	But saying a pretty big slam that's pro-Sony and anti-Nintendo In an interview with Now Gamer, Justin Richman said To be honest with you, the idea of it is very, very cool Speaking about the Wii U But there's nothing that the Wii U has that the Vita and PlayStation 3 doesn't You know, it's an interesting piece of technology And I'm interested to see how people use it
3081764	3082946	I'm not completely sold yet.
3083226	3085650	That the screen isn't multi-touch, that's a little weird.
3086190	3091738	It seems that there are some very strange holes in it, but to be fair, last time I was skeptical of the original Wii, and look at how that did.
3092078	3095082	I'm sure the games they make for Wii U will be amazing."
3096044	3109333	Finally, I'm seeing that whole observation in the mainstream media that, hell, not even the Vita, but the PSP in the PlayStation 3 was kind of capable of that same technology of having a portable screen in your hand.
3109753	3111274	And he brings up a point I forgot.
3111334	3112675	The Vita has a touchscreen.
3113055	3123342	It is going to be just like the Wii U. I mean, granted, it'll be between a PlayStation 3 and a Vita way more expensive than a Wii U most likely will be, but he's got a good point.
3124022	3124902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3151154	3152175	Well, yeah, you're right.
3152215	3157918	The ports would be a little weird on the Sony end, but you know... It'd be like something like, here's some really optional way to play this.
3158058	3162081	Maybe not like right away, but what about further down the line?
3162161	3166003	Or what about a game like, I don't know, Arkham Asylum is supposed to be on the Wii U, right?
3166443	3167944	So... That's retarded.
3168144	3168384	Oh, yeah.
3168725	3171066	It'll be out on the Wii U a year after it comes out.
3171306	3172027	Awesome!
3173047	3177028	Well, it'll have some stinking bonus feature, something that everybody has to have.
3177428	3190770	But my curiosity is, couldn't they release a similar game of the year edition, quote unquote, on the PlayStation 3 that could optionally bring up the Vita to do whatever the Wii U screen is doing?
3192970	3199272	Yeah, it could, but people would just shrug their shoulders and say, I'm not buying another fucking $299 system so that I can do this.
3202580	3203561	True, but I don't know.
3204161	3208024	If it's an optional and not a mandatory enhancement, does that make sense?
3208084	3216031	It would be like if Gran Turismo 5 was coming out, say, next year, and you could buy the Vita and use it as a rear-view mirror.
3217652	3218513	Would someone do that?
3219233	3220934	Sure, I'm sure there's someone out there that would do that.
3221055	3224357	Which is what they had showed off that the PS3 was supposed to do in 2006.
3224397	3226899	Now, is that necessarily a good use of your $299?
3226939	3227199	Probably not.
3232565	3243810	We'll see what happens when the games get a little closer to coming out for the Wii U and when the Vita comes out, exactly what types of technology we see beyond what we've just seen at E3.
3244370	3244810	Moving on.
3245611	3250733	Well, there is a dream come true for many, many people in West Virginia.
3251693	3253954	Well, first of all, I will rewind.
3253974	3255995	People stop making jokes about West Virginia?
3256015	3256095	Yeah.
3256530	3257910	Hi, we're in West Virginia.
3258771	3264873	Now, Konami is going to have the Childhood Obesity Summit in West Virginia this month.
3264973	3268594	And then they're going to have a DDR tournament for school-aged children in West Virginia.
3269074	3271575	I hear that's going to be a cool summit, except there's going to be a lot of fatties.
3272655	3273235	Stop it.
3274416	3274696	Sorry.
3277392	3286618	At any rate, it's going to be held July 27th and 28th in Charleston, and it will have representatives from the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, the U.S.
3286638	3300048	Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Michael Danzinger from The Biggest Loser, and they will also have the West Virginia University Extension Service and West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency hosting it.
3301269	3311338	There will be prizes, mainly scholarships, and they're hoping that they can just get kids more active.
3311758	3316762	There will also be a technician on hand to maintain the DDR pads as they keep breaking.
3317023	3317443	I hope.
3318644	3319445	What are you talking about?
3319485	3320326	This is DDR.
3320366	3323869	There will be no technician to tech those pads.
3324109	3325010	I think it's a good idea.
3326625	3328107	I wish I had DDR at my gym.
3328707	3332912	Anything that gets kids motivated to exercise is a good thing, I think.
3333213	3334534	We shouldn't be making fun of it.
3334595	3342524	But you have to admit, the idea of an obesity summit, doesn't that seem the slightest bit condescending to you?
3344086	3344347	Well...
3346536	3348897	Hey, anything that gets more DDR machines out there.
3348957	3350078	I mean, that's all I'm saying.
3350938	3353899	It's just like the parents telling the kids, you're going to summer camp.
3353979	3354800	Yay!
3354860	3356020	What camp are we going to?
3356401	3357681	Camp Thin and Beautiful.
3358962	3359502	You know what?
3360102	3363604	I really think that it's a good start.
3363684	3365565	I think it's a good thing.
3365645	3369647	But really, a lot of it is going to start with parental education.
3370307	3372108	You've got to look at what the influences are on the kid.
3372348	3372488	Right.
3375347	3382452	You can buy all the DDR you want, but at the end of the day, it has to be the parent that says, no, you can't have a donut until you have mowed the lawn, or whatever.
3383152	3384513	Or eat your vegetables first.
3384773	3384973	Yeah.
3385293	3385594	You know.
3387975	3388235	All right.
3388715	3391237	Well, we'll see what comes of that, and we'll let you know.
3391797	3396160	We'll let you know how big of a score the winner of the DDR tournament racks up.
3397241	3398001	I had to, sorry.
3398021	3402064	All right, let's travel the world and look at some upcoming release dates and games that are coming out soon.
3402698	3404020	There's not a whole lot this week.
3404240	3410328	This week it's basically Call of Juarez the Cartel on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3411609	3421862	Also Captain America Super Soldier that's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS, and actually that's it.
3422562	3428564	and then also the Smurfs, in case you forgot.
3429924	3431084	They have a movie coming out.
3431465	3433205	There's the Smurfs on the DS.
3433725	3444428	And because Ubisoft loves their dancing games, Smurfs Dance Party, which I saw a YouTube clip out there with one of the Smurfs songs.
3444948	3445988	Who let the Smurfs out?
3446109	3449229	I wanted to stab a needle into my ear.
3449409	3450910	It seriously was terrible.
3452030	3458492	and I also believe that just Dance Summer Party will be coming out as well on the Wii.
3459233	3459653	That's it.
3461113	3467275	I'm sorry, do you know what I have stuck in my head thanks to the whole talk about going to fat camp and going to summer camp?
3467895	3469076	You know what I have stuck in my head now?
3471577	3475738	Are you going to salute your shorts?
3477819	3480940	We run, we jump, we swim and play
3482392	3486556	I have a great idea for something.
3486616	3486917	What?
3507560	3510021	And this is just totally made me think of it for some reason.
3511262	3527108	Wouldn't it be awesome if they had some sort of social network thing where you could basically create your own TV stations that people can watch actual programming, actual TV syndicated programming that you can basically design the lineup for and have that play and people would favor it and stuff.
3527128	3527808	Wouldn't that be awesome?
3528348	3530009	Doesn't Hulu have like a playlist?
3531164	3532406	Thanks for watching!
3548366	3564569	and he got me an invite to the service and it kind of looks like iTunes kind of mixed with Napster but one of the big things is that you can build playlists and then like share them on Facebook and anybody can call up your playlist and play the songs because it's essentially kind of Napster.
3564989	3565469	in that way.
3565990	3570793	New Napster, not old Napster, but the new one that's subscribed to the service and get everything.
3571053	3572274	But it's free for right now.
3572334	3578358	It's limited to 10 hours a month or something like that on free, but it's a good way to get exposed to some new songs.
3578618	3583802	But kind of what you're describing to me sounds like that with TV, because you'd be making a television playlist, right?
3584252	3585313	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3601942	3617847	80s commercials for like products you know you could just have like the Lysol commercial whatever from the 80s but still advertising products that you have now or if people you know have products out there right now that they want to make an 80s type commercial for that'd be pretty awesome
3618706	3623229	Well, apparently there's this, you know how they used to have the Nickelodeon Game and Sports channel?
3623469	3624750	I don't think it's around anymore, is it?
3624910	3627592	It used to show the Legends of the Hidden Temple and Guts and all that stuff.
3627892	3630694	Well, now there's a Teen Nick channel that might have replaced that.
3631114	3632375	No, it's been around for a while.
3632415	3638999	Okay, well, I guess Teen Nick has a whole now 90s segment coming back, and they're going to show all the shows from the 90s.
3640200	3640520	on this.
3640560	3644042	So you know I'm going to be camped out in front of Teen Nick.
3644142	3649145	My 33-year-old ass will be camped out in front of Teen Nick when they do the marathon for this.
3650885	3651206	Yes!
3652246	3654027	I totally watched the crap out of that show.
3659750	3663512	So what have any of these people done since it's set for her?
3663552	3666173	Isn't she on a show on ABC Family with Joey Lawrence or something?
3666193	3667334	I think.
3667394	3668694	She's done a few things.
3669595	3669715	Hmm.
3673464	3677368	Those poor parents probably don't get recognized for anything else than, Hey, it's Clarissa's parents!
3678930	3679190	Anyhow.
3679791	3684777	True story, did you know that they made a pilot for a CBS TV show that was like Clarissa Grows Up or something like that?
3684837	3685017	Yes.
3685317	3687380	That was something about her becoming a journalist.
3688040	3690763	It really had nothing to do with the old show, but it just was her.
3691244	3691925	It would have been cool.
3692304	3694986	Yeah, but it didn't get picked up, so she went to do Sabrina instead.
3695006	3696187	That worked all right.
3697368	3697708	You know what?
3698128	3707975	Okay, there was another show that was on Nickelodeon when I was probably 19, but it was called, what was it called?
3708035	3712238	It was like some soap opera that they tried to do, like the teenage soap opera.
3713279	3713679	Oh, 14.
3714259	3715300	No, it wasn't 14.
3715981	3716061	Or 15.
3716181	3718242	Yeah, 15 or 17 or something like that.
3718262	3718923	15, I think, was the show.
3719003	3721204	Remember all the British programming that they used to have?
3721224	3721344	Yeah.
3722446	3724166	I just remember you can't do that on television.
3724206	3726207	That was the greatest show ever on that network.
3726227	3729347	The other thing that they did was introduce me to one of my favorite shows of all time.
3729407	3730248	Shut up, Moose.
3730728	3731608	The Tomorrow People.
3732048	3732388	Oh, yeah.
3732928	3734448	Which actually was a BBC program.
3734948	3736029	That's what I was talking about.
3736149	3738869	It was a full serial, and the series had been around since the 70s.
3740110	3743650	But I loved that damn show, and I watched the entire thing, and I've downloaded it.
3745030	3745611	All right, let me move on.
3745631	3747371	If it was out on DVD, I'd freaking buy it.
3748024	3748564	Let me move on.
3748965	3750265	Release dates for Japan.
3750585	3752966	How do we get from release dates to Clarissa Explains It All?
3752986	3753386	That was my fault.
3753506	3753987	I don't know.
3754047	3755007	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
3755327	3755567	All right.
3756508	3759169	On the Xbox 360, some games coming out very soon.
3759349	3765092	Alice Madness Returns in Japan as well as Fear F3AR.
3765872	3770354	Final Fantasy XIII International Edition comes to the Xbox 360 as well.
3770914	3771174	I'm sorry.
3771194	3772195	That's a price reduction.
3772555	3772735	Sorry.
3774187	3776269	will only set you back about half as much as it did before.
3776950	3779152	Going to the PlayStation 3.
3781647	3785151	Alice Madness returns there as well, as well as F.E.A.R.
3785371	3788174	and the Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hearts.
3788314	3788555	F.E.A.R.
3788635	3789355	is Fear 3.
3789395	3789696	Fear 3.
3790637	3791858	Well, it's F.3.A.R.
3792058	3793220	It's that whole stylized... I know.
3793260	3793580	It's stupid.
3793600	3795402	Like how Scream 4 had a 4 in there.
3795422	3796083	All right, forget it.
3796984	3803691	No More Heroes, the Red Zone Edition, also on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan, and Sniper Ghost Warrior this week as well.
3803991	3805232	Sengoku Basara Chronicle Heroes Capcom
3829261	3833845	brings back the two-on-two battles and all the famous scenes from the previous six installments.
3834886	3837548	So I guess this is a long-going... It's like Dynasty Warriors.
3838989	3840611	...series in Japan.
3843253	3845915	Try to bring out Nintendo, see what's going on in their world, if anything.
3847737	3848337	Devil Rhythm
3870604	3873185	I think I've seen this girl in other games before, this little character.
3873526	3873866	Which one?
3874026	3874987	I've seen her before.
3875187	3878089	It's Gabrielle's Ghostly Groove is what's coming out over here.
3878109	3878710	Thank you.
3878990	3880211	It's a 3DS version of that.
3881732	3883373	It's on WiiWare right now if you want to check.
3883813	3884934	WiiWare or DSiWare.
3885435	3885995	I think WiiWare.
3887656	3908284	and then next week Super Pokemon Scramble comes out on the 3DS so it's a Pokemon game even though it's not like an actual Pokemon game it's a Pokemon mini game thing I guess it looks kind of cute actually I'd check that out if it comes out over here there it is your Japanese release dates let's move over to the old kingdom DarkSakura
3908684	3909425	Not a whole bunch.
3909745	3916771	On the 22nd we have Calvarez, The Cartel, and Cars 2, The Video Game, and Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon.
3917852	3918432	That's it.
3918993	3920975	I'm surprised it's coming out over there as Earth Defense Force.
3920995	3923297	They used to call it Global Defense Force.
3924162	3926022	I'm going to double check.
3926503	3927583	Yeah, it says Earth Defense Force.
3928503	3930824	Do they not like the word Earth over there or something?
3931084	3941206	Well, it was the fact that they were localizing it from Japan, so they called it Global Defense Force over there.
3941246	3942946	It never really came out over here on PlayStation.
3942966	3944867	So it's our fault for calling it Earth Defense Force.
3944887	3949988	There were a lot of other series that were renamed just for censorship issues, like Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.
3950188	3956290	Well, I'm also thinking about, you know, what comes to mind is the whole fact that Captain America's coming out in some countries as the first Avenger.
3956750	3959311	Like, you know, it's Captain America's a bad thing.
3959871	3960331	It's just funny.
3962312	3962572	I know.
3962632	3964053	No, I'm totally serious.
3964093	3966093	Certain countries are getting it as the first Avenger.
3967514	3968534	So, interesting.
3969034	3970755	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.
3971055	3976817	At least they're not giving it the Hetalia treatment where he's making, you know, he's eating cheeseburgers or something.
3977677	3980943	A couple more news stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.
3981063	3981865	But first, Loki.
3982401	3985362	You know, I'd be willing to see, like, you know how they have Italian Spider-Man?
3985462	3986962	Italian Captain America.
3987762	3989963	Japanese Spider-Man is freaking hilarious, by the way.
3991023	3992323	Awesome.
3992583	3996444	So there is a new model of PlayStation 3 coming out.
3997164	3998585	Actually now, I believe.
4000005	4005646	And it's to conform to a new thing that was passed back in December.
4006146	4008227	The, what was it, the...
4009252	4030580	and the AACS Final Adopter Agreement which basically is some sort of DRM that they have standardized that all media companies must adhere to and this means that they need to only support Blu-ray playback high definition Blu-ray playback
4031420	4036224	Only over HDMI because it's the only way this kind of DRM works.
4036584	4046312	So these new systems will be unable to play HD Blu-ray movies over Component.
4046652	4048834	It's only going to be available through HDMI.
4050955	4051596	Games are fine.
4051876	4060263	Games you can still play over Component but you will not be able to play over Component for Blu-ray.
4060943	4062704	It's not something Sony is necessarily doing.
4062724	4064144	It's something that everybody has to do.
4066045	4076928	If Microsoft has a new system coming out, say that supports Blu-ray later on, they will not be able to have Blu-ray playback over Component.
4078382	4079643	What are you talking about, Loki?
4079683	4082045	This is just because Sony's a bunch of cheap bastards.
4082085	4089070	That's why this is happening, because they are cheap bastards and they want to cut out the things that they're putting in the boxes for the PlayStation 3.
4089171	4092093	Well, you mean cut out things that they're putting in the boxes.
4092853	4094715	That's what I read on the internet, so it must be true.
4095515	4097476	Well, that's what initially everyone thought.
4099817	4100597	Like myself.
4101637	4103658	Come on, I wouldn't put it past them.
4104398	4109280	They've done things to cut out power usage and stuff like that.
4109300	4110941	It really just saves them money on components.
4111061	4117143	So instead you're telling me that Sony just waited until the last minute to implement their own standard for Blu-ray.
4119019	4123225	Um, not even really the last minute because I don't think this goes into effect until 2012.
4123806	4126169	So they kind of just said, hey, you know what?
4126450	4127271	We're just going to do it now.
4129294	4131057	And before the Xmas rush.
4131471	4132912	Yeah.
4134052	4136553	But here's the thing, though, is they didn't ever explain it to anybody.
4136894	4145978	And I don't think there's anything on the box that calls out... Well, I don't see Sony putting out a press release going, guess what, we've taken a feature away from the PlayStation 3.
4146098	4147339	No, they don't have to say it like that.
4147379	4156003	They could just say, due to blah, blah, blah, playback of high-def Blu-ray movies can only be facilitated through HDMI.
4156023	4156183	Right.
4157144	4161652	And to be clear, though, you can still hook up your PlayStation 3 through component cables.
4161853	4166442	It will only play the games and the movies in standard def, right?
4166803	4167023	Yes.
4168867	4168987	Hmm.
4170290	4170910	That sucks.
4170990	4172891	My old TV didn't even have HDMI.
4172971	4174912	I had to hook up through Component, and it was an HDTV.
4174932	4181254	Thankfully, I do have HDMI on my TV, and I am hooked up through HDMI for my PlayStation 3.
4181614	4188677	But once again, I mean, because HDMI cables are so damn cheap, I don't understand why they don't throw one in there.
4188997	4189778	Oh, wait, I know why.
4189818	4194319	Because they sell HDMI cables for $40 when anybody can go out and get them for like $3.
4194359	4194500	Right.
4198908	4199210	Whatever.
4199491	4200717	It sucks, but that's life.
4202432	4204093	Alright, anyhow, one more story for you guys.
4204113	4206255	This has to do with a new Bomani game.
4206715	4214701	For you fans of DDR and Beatmania 2DX, there's information about a new game that is being tested at Leisureland in Akiba, Tokyo.
4215841	4218483	It is called Sound Voltex Booth.
4218603	4220345	That's not vortex, that's voltex.
4220625	4222466	It's like volts, like energy.
4223307	4230672	There's some video that has hit the internet that shows this game in action, and apparently kind of what this game looks like... That's the little fuzzy music you hear in the background...
4231212	4238319	It kind of looks like, imagine like a Beatmania screen that's more like Guitar Hero, I guess, looking like that.
4238599	4242623	But it looks like not only are there buttons, but there's some type of tilt mechanism in this game too.
4242943	4250050	Because you'll notice as the song goes on, the guy kind of has to drive and tilt the thing a little bit before he starts hitting buttons.
4250590	4252953	So it looks like it kind of incorporates both those features into it.
4253593	4254214	Kind of interesting.
4256288	4256568	Location Test
4278756	4297049	Konami has trademarked some names Sound Voltex Booth and Sound Voltex Floor possibly localized versions of the game I don't know, I guess it would depend on how well this one does so, we'll see anyhow, it's time to take a stroll down memory lane in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week
4300094	4306744	Every week here at Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura dives into the vault and pulls out a classic game that she thinks, hey, why aren't you kids playing this game?
4306784	4307525	It's awesome.
4308507	4309949	Enough with your newfangled crap.
4310410	4312493	Enjoy this old classic for a change.
4312553	4314897	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4315416	4316457	It is Tekken 3.
4317639	4321002	I figured since I did Soul Blade last week, I'd do Tekken 3 this week.
4321142	4325247	Because this was my favorite fighting game for ages.
4328450	4330533	It came out in the arcade in March 1997.
4332455	4333996	And it came out on the PlayStation in 1998.
4336338	4343482	There was a simplified arcade version that came out on PS2 as part of Tekken 5's arcade history mode.
4345022	4348484	But the PlayStation version is probably considered one of the greatest ones ever.
4349484	4359009	It was the first game on Namco System 12 hardware, and it was the last one that came on the original PlayStation.
4360632	4362334	It is such a fun game.
4362574	4368140	This game came out when I worked for Namco Arcade and I played the crap out of it.
4369822	4381974	As far as the characters that were in it, it had basically, you could unlock all of the classic characters later on, but it had its own new characters too.
4383275	4391083	The ones that returned at the beginning were Paul Phoenix, Nina Williams, Yoshimitsu, and Lei Wulong.
4391663	4394486	And also you could unlock Anna Williams and Heihachi.
4395367	4407358	And the new characters that came in were Jin Kazama, Xiaoyu, Hualrong, King2, which is the wrestler with the mask, Eddie Gordo, who is every masher's favorite.
4408018	4408959	and ForestFlaw.
4408999	4426331	And then you could also unlock Kuma and Panda, Julia Chung, who was my second favorite person to use in the game, Brian Fury, Gunjack, Mokujin, Ogre, True Ogre, and Tiger Jackson, who was the swap for Eddie Gordo with the Fro and everything.
4426872	4428313	This is the character I loved right here.
4428333	4428693	Hwarong.
4428773	4429313	Hwarong.
4429694	4430014	He's awesome.
4430034	4430694	I love his music.
4430714	4432035	You can turn it up a little bit.
4432075	4432336	Hwarong.
4435365	4435765	Thanks for watching!
4456891	4459193	Now, in the PlayStation version, you had two other characters.
4459213	4466997	You had Gon, who I don't know if anyone's ever heard of the comic, and I will link something in the chat room.
4467597	4476762	Gon is a little dinosaur, and there is a manga, a big manga series, and honestly, his ending and everything was pretty...
4477302	4478043	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4493787	4505394	and also Dr. Bosconovich, who was actually supposed to be an unlockable in the arcade version, but he ended up being a bonus in the PlayStation version.
4506334	4515319	So there was another one that was for Bleemcast, which was a boot disk for the Dreamcast that you could boot the PlayStation version of the game.
4515399	4518861	I've got it, and it really just enhanced the resolution.
4518901	4520102	It made it look a lot better.
4521002	4521082	Um...
4523064	4528950	But it also did sort of screw up some of the background images versus the stage.
4529691	4536118	Kind of almost how it did in... You remember the Japanese version of Tekken Tag Tournament?
4536678	4539441	Where it would do that weird thing between the ground and the backwards stage?
4539542	4540603	Where they would separate?
4540703	4541684	It kind of did that number.
4544667	4551275	But, I mean, this is lauded by lots of people as one of the best PlayStation games ever.
4551476	4559165	It got a 96 out of 100 on Metacritic, and it's ranked the number two on their list of greatest PlayStation games.
4559285	4560987	Also, this was the music I really liked.
4565834	4566775	Forrest Law's music.
4568596	4569336	His ending was funny.
4570677	4573518	And yes, I have beaten him, but never the one.
4574819	4577181	Now, this is actually a little bit of fun trivia.
4577581	4589047	Tekken 3 was the first game to get a 10 on EGM's revised review scale, saying that a game no longer had to be perfect to get a 10, and the last game that got a 10 was Sonic & Knuckles.
4591029	4593030	So, it honestly is...
4595900	4596721	One of my favorites.
4596761	4601567	I mean, I have to say it is a masher's paradise, especially with Eddie Gordo.
4603089	4604471	Yeah, I loved him.
4604691	4605432	That was awesome.
4605845	4609367	See, I would only use him to play Tiger, because Tiger was so freaking hilarious.
4610267	4621293	But the game had great music, and I'll tell you one thing, actually, and this is actually fairly common with me and the Namco games when they bring them home and have their arranged version of the soundtrack.
4622233	4626896	I always preferred the arcade soundtrack, except for a couple of cases in Soul Calibur.
4626996	4630898	Not Soul Calibur, but Soul Blade, because I like Cervantes' arranged music better.
4631798	4633119	Thank you for watching!
4652993	4657137	But I would always watch the Japanese forums to see who was going to be the next character to come out.
4657577	4663823	And they actually had a different release schedule for the US machines versus the Japanese machines.
4664483	4670388	So I would sometimes be able to guess, because they had this little screen pop up that says, guess who or who's next or something.
4671089	4674092	And I would usually be able to accurately say who was the next character coming out.
4675153	4676233	So it was pretty neat.
4677174	4677655	And, uh...
4679235	4679375	Whoops.
4707828	4716717	and we were talking about just seeing how far it could go and I said, there's going to come a day where you're not going to be able to tell the 3D from the real thing.
4716837	4724284	And now they've even got different types of motion capture so advanced that you really can't tell the difference unless you're really looking for it, you know?
4725766	4725966	So...
4727407	4733534	But as far as this, it is, I think to this day, my favorite Tekken game.
4733714	4736738	I mean, I really loved Tekken 4.
4736918	4745688	I'm still pissed off about... What was that game, that company, that I gave the bad Better Business Bureau review to?
4747049	4751631	because they sent me the Asian version and not the Japanese version and I specifically asked for the Japanese version.
4751851	4752732	I don't even remember.
4752792	4754833	It was one of those, like, was it Toys?
4754853	4756053	It wasn't Toys and Joys.
4756093	4757314	Toys and Joys has always been good.
4758294	4763597	It was like, import something or... Yeah, I know what you're talking about, though.
4763637	4765077	They're long since out of business, but...
4766818	4788449	The other good thing about this one is that, like I mentioned, it had a mode called Tekken Force, which was a kind of side-scrolling version, a beat-em-up like Streets of Rage, and it was one where you would go through different stages, and if you beat the minigame four times, then you could unlock Dr. Bosconovich.
4790009	4791110	You had to beat him first, of course.
4791670	4813001	and then it had another version that was called Tekken Ball that was like beach volleyball except you had to charge the ball so you had to use a powerful attack to try to hurt your opponent or hit the ball so that it hits the ground and then your character would get injured if it touched the ground or the opponent's character would get injured if it touched the ground and
4816462	4817243	It was just awesome.
4817303	4818123	It was super fun.
4818263	4823847	So you can still find it, you know, and if you get Tekken 5, it's in the history mode.
4823947	4825428	So there you go.
4826468	4828890	One of the best games ever, I think.
4830410	4831491	Alright, there it is, Tekken 3.
4831671	4834652	Yeah, because I like this character.
4835192	4835852	The other one ran out.
4835892	4837953	You know what's funny in the intro, though, on the PlayStation version?
4838834	4840034	This is what Namco was doing.
4840074	4842335	Look how we can render individual hairs!
4843216	4845197	And it looks so unnatural.
4846197	4846377	Nice.
4846537	4847197	Oh, jeez.
4847898	4848118	Nice.
4848718	4851481	Alright, well that's going to do it for the Classic Game of the Week.
4851961	4855985	But don't go anywhere because Orange Lingerie is going to be right back with Part B of our show tonight.
4856305	4857887	We have some rapid fire news for you guys.
4857927	4859689	Some news about PopCap got sold.
4859729	4860770	We've got to talk about that one.
4861531	4865074	Talk about some news around EA's camp when it comes to server shutdowns.
4865675	4866475	And some...
4867256	4868297	Discussion topics tonight.
4868317	4875743	You know, tonight the news is a little bit light, but we're going to talk about is good parenting better than a violent video game ban?
4875943	4877825	I'm sure that'll get everybody riled up here in studio.
4878265	4881608	And stop hating on sports games, says one writer.
4881628	4885672	We're going to talk about all that when we come back with more tonight of Orange Lounge Radio.
4891940	4892581	Orange Lounge Radio
4907134	4912318	So, we're going to get back into some gaming news, including rapid-fire news, as well as your tweets.
4912518	4916881	So this is your last chance to get in those Twitter topics, twitter.com slash OLR.
4916941	4921044	But first, I want to just give a quick plug for other projects and things that we're working on.
4921404	4926868	Of course, The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth is a Warcraft podcast that I host with my buddy, Extifer.
4927188	4947618	for more information you can visit www.hoardhouse.com sadly there wasn't a new show this week so there was some other stuff going on but we should be back next week so this would be a great time to catch up on the 31 some odd back episodes there are of the show and listen to our potty humor in talking about Warcraft but never too seriously I have a new impression by the way what's that?
4948178	4949199	What is nature's call?
4950620	4952161	I get sick of hearing it every time.
4952522	4955404	Is that one of the chicks in Warcraft when you get a quest?
4955544	4955925	Avrila?
4956225	4957045	Yeah.
4957246	4958627	The centaur girl?
4958647	4959267	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
4960408	4961789	Ah, the great outdoors!
4961909	4963611	Yeah, yeah, I know exactly who you're talking about.
4964251	4965512	Screw her.
4965552	4965852	Anyhow.
4966033	4966233	Ow!
4967774	4968575	Very carefully.
4968595	4969856	You just gotta get those hind... never mind.
4970456	4970797	Anyway.
4971438	4974783	Also, I want to plug a guest appearance I did this week on Under Sedation Live.
4974963	4976385	Of course, it was their 10th anniversary show.
4976425	4978969	I talked about that at the top of the program, but fun.
4979029	4981232	And a lot of the chatters were saying it was a very different side of me.
4981613	4983295	It was on that show, and I'm just saying, well, I just...
4984144	4985425	It's not really about games.
4985685	4987166	It was the old Rob.
4987706	4988446	It was still me.
4988826	4990407	I didn't go in there with a different mindset.
4990447	4994269	It's just I don't have to worry about... It's not my show, quote unquote, anymore.
4994289	4995750	You're different when you're not facilitating.
4995770	4996710	Yeah, I'm not facilitating.
4996730	4997611	I'm not in the MC role.
4997671	5001513	And plus, I realize on that show, conversation will go anywhere and anywhere.
5001573	5005835	This show, I've got to make sure after a 20-minute tangent, it does get back to games eventually.
5006175	5006715	But that show...
5008717	5013243	I was in the same boat when I was running the gig when Tiara guested.
5013503	5016868	It's just a different role.
5017489	5018450	When you have to be moderator.
5018490	5024458	It's just like Julie Chan on Big Brother versus Julie Chan on The Talk for those that actually watch daytime TV.
5024798	5026379	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5048835	5077437	because they discovered robots have emotion now yes apparently she got her emotion chip put in she can learn DarkSakura I don't know if you can plug the stuff you've been guesting on it's actually the podcast that Tiara and our friend Weasel do for Geek Life it's called Pop Culture Parlay if you go to geek-life.com I am going to be on the next two episodes so yay awesome
5078512	5083705	and it was a very interesting discussion and there was some Pyramid Head mentioned.
5084787	5085389	I'll leave it at that.
5086112	5086372	Great.
5087253	5091496	So by the way, it sounds like I didn't even realize this, but the chat room is telling me my audio cut out for a little bit there.
5091516	5094158	I don't know if that's the mic or whatever, but there was audio issues.
5094558	5097581	Can you hear me now, chat room?
5097801	5098241	It's not you.
5098301	5098882	I think it was me.
5099302	5099402	Oh.
5099923	5100683	I don't know what's going on.
5101544	5106007	Rob was talking about how he likes to do things in the dark.
5106347	5109270	How sad I'm giving the plug for Under Sedation Live and it cut out.
5109570	5112932	Rob was on Under Sedation Live, guys, and it was epic.
5112972	5113613	Yeah, there you go.
5113813	5114173	I don't know.
5115134	5117157	Listen to Horde House, listen on your station live.
5117177	5118499	And there was diarrhea involved.
5119420	5119841	Let's not.
5120682	5123586	Should I go check on your coffee?
5126289	5128372	I don't know if that's a good thing to bring up right after that.
5129301	5132383	Alright, can we move on, please, with some rapid-fire news.
5132823	5141167	Going to... And, by the way, Brad from PodCulture in the chatroom says, Big difference between innocent and not guilty.
5141948	5147091	I don't want to get too political on this program or what have you or talk about controversial stuff because, you know...
5147931	5163207	I'll let, uh, what's her name, uh, God, what's, what's that chick on the CNN show that, oh God, Nancy Grace, that's, that, I'll leave that discussion to her, but fine, I stand corrected on, on my earlier comment Uh, let's get to some rapid fire news though, Loki, why don't you start us
5163968	5174511	Alright, well there is a rumor that apparently during Comic Con they're going to announce a new Marvel vs. Capcom kind of iteration, I guess.
5175812	5177872	Or Marvel vs. Capcom 3 to be exact.
5178492	5189956	The actual announcement is supposed to be Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and it's supposed to include a roster update including, I think, 12 extra characters.
5190956	5198501	are supposed to be added to the roster and it will be sold for $40 retail.
5198841	5211468	Some of the rumored characters, of course, Doc Doc, because I guess there were some files that referenced him in the ISO that was floating around out there.
5212729	5219573	Apparently, there is a panel for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at Comic Con, so it makes sense that they would maybe make an announcement.
5220242	5222023	Maybe they just want to give out tips.
5224604	5225184	Okay, maybe not.
5226264	5229145	It's hard to believe that it wasn't that long ago that the game came out.
5229165	5230306	I mean, February.
5231086	5235208	Well, Street Fighter 4 and Super Street Fighter 4, kind of the same thing happened.
5235968	5237188	Yeah.
5237208	5238109	12 characters is a lot, though.
5238429	5239229	I mean, that would be kind of cool.
5241911	5242792	Some other fun stuff.
5243853	5247356	Apparently, the Super Mario Bros.
5247516	5248817	movie could have been a lot better.
5249217	5256223	And some of the earlier drafts, I guess, of the script actually had it a little bit more traditional to the actual Mario Bros.
5256263	5256484	game.
5257304	5265531	There actually was supposed to be some sort of epic boss fight over lava and stuff with Koopa and a lot of, like, you know...
5267879	5272120	The scenery that you would see in the game will actually kind of take place in the movie.
5272240	5275161	Also, I guess Koopa's flying around in a giant floating pirate ship.
5276801	5285903	But unfortunately what we got ended up being some sort of weird Mario Judge Dredd movie.
5286383	5287204	Wait a minute.
5287264	5292905	You mean that executives came in and fucked the whole thing up because they thought they knew what people wanted?
5293945	5295826	I've never heard of this happening before.
5295866	5296606	Not anywhere.
5298194	5299175	Yeah, yeah, I know.
5299415	5299876	It's weird.
5300036	5300396	It's weird.
5302598	5303239	But that's what they did.
5304801	5307643	And then finally, I guess this is kind of funny.
5307723	5313129	They actually had a dig at Capcom in Ms.
5313209	5314090	Splosion Man.
5314891	5322058	And it's during one of the levels that looks very much like the Star Road in Super Mario World.
5322778	5324179	and they're all, who does this?
5324239	5327420	I mean, this is completely ripped off.
5327460	5329421	What is this, a Capcom game or something?
5330041	5331821	So, it's funny.
5332682	5332922	Nice.
5333782	5335783	All right, going to some other quick stories here.
5336403	5339084	There's an epic mod on its way out for StarCraft.
5339144	5341145	It's called StarCraft Universe.
5341185	5344106	You might have known this previously as World of StarCraft.
5344346	5345267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5359443	5362906	Well, this was all back in January when that whole thing happened.
5363206	5366789	But now there is a trailer out with gameplay from the alpha version.
5367590	5374215	So I guess in a press release that the dude sent to Kotaku, he wanted to update everybody on the mod's progress.
5374776	5377018	So yeah, kind of interesting that it's going.
5377038	5380781	Let me play a little bit of that trailer here in studio so folks can see what that is.
5381301	5385002	I mean, this looks like an epic mod for StarCraft.
5385022	5385943	There's some cinematics there.
5385963	5387263	I want to see if we can get some gameplay.
5387803	5394165	When you look at the gameplay, it really does kind of look like World of Warcraft, but in the StarCraft universe, which is kind of cool.
5395946	5402848	Complete with the hit points for numbers and the whole kind of first-person-esque 3D environments.
5404625	5405306	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5423882	5428805	Now, the creator of this actually left school to work on StarCraft Universe for full time.
5429185	5434708	He says, at this point, I'm learning way more creating StarCraft Universe than I ever would at school.
5435149	5443173	Most of my friends trying to get into creative industry find themselves having to grind out a massive portfolio to find any work after four years of college.
5444334	5445175	This is very true.
5446055	5447336	Wow, that's crazy.
5447816	5447976	So...
5450120	5453676	Blizzard would be dumb not to hire him if this ends up being a pretty awesome thing here.
5456158	5456758	We'll have to see.
5457938	5459579	We'll have to see how that works out.
5460159	5462119	Also, other news stories.
5462359	5466500	Incubus, you know the band, they're getting their own video game.
5467020	5468300	It's called Incubattle.
5469841	5474642	It's a beat-em-up that's very similar to Scott Pilgrim vs. the World in that whole retro style.
5474662	5477682	You know what that reminds me of actually more so than that?
5477982	5481123	Remember the Linkin Park game that they put out in like iOS or something?
5481323	5481703	Yeah.
5481884	5483065	It's very much like that.
5483125	5483565	There you go.
5483605	5487949	Well, you can pick one of the band's five members and you go on the streets and fight.
5488429	5489050	Who do you fight?
5489390	5492613	Pirates trying to steal the band's latest album.
5494054	5494554	Seriously?
5494855	5496296	That is seriously who you're fighting.
5498257	5498838	That's awesome.
5499499	5502422	No indication on what, I mean, you can click on this.
5502462	5503743	Is this a Flash game or something?
5504604	5505105	I don't know.
5505745	5507868	Yeah, it looks like a little Flash game you can actually play there.
5508408	5509369	That's retarded.
5509409	5510350	Yeah, I'm not going to play that.
5510811	5515696	I'm going to go cause physical harm to pirates because they do physical harm to my wall.
5515716	5518999	Well, if they have the whole hats and the eye patch, that's actually kind of awesome.
5521730	5526374	Anyhow, Arkham City's collector's edition has announced some pre-orders.
5526954	5530037	GameStop and Best Buy both priced the collector's edition.
5530537	5547231	And let's see, Best Buy actually went ahead and priced the collection at $99.99 and explained the content saying, a premium statue, an art book, Gotham Knight animated material, and, interestingly enough, early access to download content.
5547731	5550914	It all comes out on October 18th when the game is set to come out.
5551414	5552275	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5569824	5570745	Alright, there you go.
5571525	5577709	By the way, we actually have a new Incubus single apparently has released to promote the new game.
5577829	5579390	Who would have known that this is coming out?
5579430	5580291	But here you go.
5580631	5582012	Let's take a little listen here.
5591176	5596060	You say, I'll just make a copy for me and a friend Then he'll make one and she'll make one and where will it end?
5596460	5610491	One leads to another, then more And no one buys any dish from the store So no one gets paid and they can't make more The posse breaks up and that's close to store Don't copy, don't copy that floppy So let me break this down for you
5613940	5614361	There you go.
5614401	5615582	Don't copy that floppy.
5615622	5618404	The hot new Incubus single that's going to be in that game.
5618624	5619205	It's great.
5619405	5620246	As you fight the pirates.
5620646	5621487	Hell about some different news.
5621507	5622608	It's an interesting new sound for them.
5623308	5624609	Yeah.
5625730	5627172	Well, here's some good news.
5627392	5630474	For Sonic Generations, guess who's going to be there?
5631295	5632175	Metal Sonic!
5632435	5636477	And it's going to be old school Metal Sonic and he's going to be one of the rivals.
5637697	5639758	I freaking love Mecha Sonic so that's really cool.
5640658	5644820	That was actually my favorite part of Sonic CD.
5646556	5647677	and then Konami.
5647977	5649058	Yes, Konami again.
5649618	5651099	They're giving us a choice.
5651399	5664088	It's actually up on Xbox Live Arcade and PSN where they're going to let basically the people who subscribe to these services choose the next game.
5664148	5665469	It's on their Facebook page.
5666109	5667010	So there's a question there.
5667070	5672053	In a perfect world, what previously released Konami classic would you like to see next on Xbox Live Arcade or PSN?
5672373	5673234	Simpsons Arcade game.
5673694	5673874	Yes.
5674975	5676395	No, I want YY Konami World.
5677256	5683518	And then, last but not least, Child of Eden is going to be on PlayStation 3 on September 23rd.
5684618	5698162	And it's basically going to also have revised versions, I believe, of some other games, I want to say.
5700271	5718507	there's Call of Juarez the Cartel on the 16th of September World Rally Championship 2011 on October 7th and Connect Party Rabbids Alive and Kicking on 360 in November also Far Cry 3 and Brothers in Arms Furious 4 are going to be on 2012 the end
5721255	5723877	All right, let's get to Twitter topics tonight.
5724337	5730641	Every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR, because after all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
5731502	5737706	Sometimes you want to ask questions, or you want to make sure we touch on a story at some point during this show, or you just have an opinion you want to share.
5737766	5741869	We read your feedback in 120, or excuse me, 140 characters or less.
5743410	5748113	Ramaditya Knight tweets us, saying, what is your favorite NES multi-cart?
5749588	5749968	Super Mario Bros.
5749988	5750769	Duck Hunt Super Mario Bros.
5750789	5751009	Duck Hunt
5770117	5770898	That was a good one, too.
5771358	5772559	I was thinking Donkey Kong Jr.
5772579	5773200	and Donkey Kong.
5775061	5775361	Loki?
5776402	5787952	I really wish I'd played more of those pirated multi-carts because they had some Final Fantasy 7 and the Titanic game.
5788532	5790213	Oh, God, yeah.
5790233	5792415	There's some amazing garbage in those cards.
5792675	5795238	Well, Ramaditya Knight gives you some ideas there.
5795298	5796519	Super Vision 110 in 1 and Super 190 in 1.
5799659	5800701	My favorite multi-cart?
5800941	5802664	Short Order and Eggsplode.
5803004	5804266	They were power pad games.
5804306	5805147	Anyone ever play those?
5806229	5807010	It was awesome.
5807090	5808532	One of them was whack-a-mole with your feet.
5808673	5809494	That was Eggsplode.
5810315	5811777	Anyway.
5811817	5812418	Moving on.
5812638	5813400	More tweets.
5816316	5816957	Uh, let's see.
5818098	5828048	Matt, SSJ100Matt on Twitter tweets us and says, Hey, Toys R Us is having a $15 sale on all Tony Hawk and DJ Guitar Hero bundles.
5828489	5828689	Wow.
5828709	5829890	That's a great deal.
5830211	5829890	$15?
5830231	5831051	That's an awesome deal.
5831292	5834655	Like, if you don't own DJ Hero, you might want to, like, consider that.
5835055	5839120	Actually, shit, I would love to just pick up an extra guitar controller, to be honest.
5839880	5862027	guitar hero bundles for real hold on i'm going to the source here he's linking us to a thread on cheap ass gamer uh it works on the bundles but not the super combo bundles for guitar hero on tour combos would be ridiculous guitar hero 5 and guitar hero warriors of rock holy crap yeah the super bundles i mean those are basically like you know the all the instruments
5863203	5882208	I might have to do that, that's a pretty damn good deal I gotta tell you this much, we were clearing out some old inventory We had $50, I could buy you the DJ Hero 2 party set on the Wii Two turntables and a microphone at a game for $50 Is that where it's at?
5882288	5884809	If I play it on the Wii, man, that's an awesome deal
5886596	5889898	Alright, moving on, Tigerclaw tweets us a few things.
5890699	5895282	One is a story about how Steam apparently has improved its content delivery system.
5896063	5900086	Defense of the Ancients 2 will be making use of the new system when it comes out soon.
5901066	5905710	But apparently, yeah, it has to do with the fact that when new games come out on launch day from Steam...
5906130	5906390	DarkSakura
5926355	5945787	for those that have ISPs with monthly bandwidth caps Steam will no longer force you to download unnecessary data when a game is updated you will just download whatever's been changed rather than the entire files can't believe they weren't doing this before but that's a great improvement help cut back on some of the bandwidth overall
5946407	5956197	And you can also get into download scheduling, bandwidth throttling, and the ability to prioritize the order that games are downloaded for updates and so forth.
5956497	5958339	That's all coming to Steam very soon.
5958899	5965966	Now, not everything on Steam will be able to use this right away, but Dota will be the first game to use it when it comes out soon.
5966466	5969409	Very interesting that they're pegging that as a game to use it soon.
5969509	5970670	I had no idea this game was...
5971331	5971792	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5983228	5984848	And it has to do with Hideo Kojima.
5985289	5986109	And he says, you know what?
5986189	5988029	I don't have time for a new Snatcher game.
5988970	5990950	But if someone else wants to do it, great.
5991590	5994691	So might be kind of opening the door there to a new Snatcher game.
5995211	5999012	It was in an interview with PlayStation Blog when he was asked about games like L.A.
5999072	6001433	Noire and Deus Ex Human Revolution.
6001473	6002633	Do you want to make a new Snatcher game?
6003053	6004334	Kojima said, quote, L.A.
6004374	6007675	Noire is a game that I really like, but unfortunately I have not played it.
6009675	6013457	I think it is coming out in Japan today, so when I return, I intend to play it.
6013897	6020560	The idea of an open world in 3D is very good, and I would love to do something like Snatcher, but I do not have the time or the means to do so.
6020920	6024381	But if anyone else would like to develop it, I would love it.
6025162	6028243	So, Team Bondi, you might need to give Hideo Kojima a call.
6028903	6031904	You might not even have to work 100-hour work weeks to get that game done.
6032144	6032504	Who knows?
6033445	6033685	Anyhow...
6034065	6035506	That's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.
6035546	6038387	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to get your tweets in for next week.
6038507	6040127	In the meantime, back to gaming news.
6040487	6042748	Your phone calls in about 30 minutes here on OLR.
6042788	6044509	The mailbag's coming up soon as well.
6045149	6046650	FUs of the week and all that stuff you love.
6047570	6047790	Loki.
6048499	6050721	Yes, this is kind of neat.
6051061	6053263	EA bought PopCap.
6053443	6058528	I mean, thank God it wasn't Zynga, which they were in the running, by the way.
6059549	6063312	EA purchased PopCap games for $750 million.
6063552	6072240	And then also, of course, there are some bonuses, including some performance bonuses, I guess.
6072640	6073080	Good job, PopCap!
6095270	6096691	Thanks for watching!
6114378	6115099	Yeah, that is kind of bad.
6140925	6144007	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6158277	6159458	Plants vs. Zombies.
6159558	6162701	Name me one thing you can't play Plants vs. Zombies on.
6163042	6163402	Let's see.
6165324	6168086	Maybe an old Nokia phone and an Atari 2600.
6168367	6169167	That's probably it.
6169187	6171469	And I would bet somebody's probably tried to port it to the 2600.
6176454	6178356	Actually, yeah, you can play that well because there's a Quest.
6179378	6196486	Peace Bloom vs. Ghouls I have my Peace Bloom They'll remove that quest from a while I'm keeping my Peace Bloom You better not take my Peace Bloom I don't think they will I love my stupid singing flower I actually hate those fucking flowers that sing You'll be walking through Stormwind
6199684	6200885	Shut the fuck up.
6200925	6203065	I want a torch to set those things on fire.
6203225	6208207	Why couldn't they give us one of the plants that look like Audrey?
6208227	6209748	I want a zombie to eat that plant.
6209808	6210988	Anyway, I digress.
6212829	6216190	I guess if it's a good business thing for PopCap, then yay, winners.
6216290	6218851	But there's always going to be that part of me that's a little bit nervous.
6219651	6221672	A little bit nervous about what the future has.
6224218	6230102	Breakroom in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com If Zynga bought PopCap games, I would still be crying.
6231784	6235026	TigerClaw says, you know EA is going to be milking those PopCap games.
6236207	6238088	TigerClaw says, Peggle Battlefield.
6239009	6240150	I don't know if it'll get that bad.
6241693	6248777	I think EA just kind of wants something to fall back on if their games, you know, it's not like EA doesn't have a humongous library of games.
6249657	6254099	But if, you know, it's nice to have some proven winners in their hat.
6254620	6264264	And that would maybe be the best news out of all with this is that if EA knows they've got a winner in their back pocket, then maybe they'll experiment with some new stuff.
6264424	6271268	On the other hand, I mean, I'm sure that's just wishful thinking on my part, but forgive me for being a dreamer.
6273342	6275203	People say you're a dreamer, but you're not the only one.
6275223	6276544	I'm not the only one, exactly.
6277424	6278605	So, there you go.
6280065	6284147	Moving on, this is another story that's kind of about Zynga and it's about EA.
6284207	6285928	It's interesting how these things come full circle.
6286228	6290110	This is about the NBA Jam creator, Mark Turmel.
6290451	6298695	He created the NBA Jam series that recently came back last year, although it kind of came back with a... Hopefully the arcade ones this year will be a little better.
6299155	6300836	He has left EA Sports.
6300996	6302116	You know where he works now?
6302637	6302957	Zynga.
6304753	6311491	Yeah, so he now works at Zynga, so who knows what he's gonna create for them over there.
6311531	6313276	He was assimilated into their collective.
6314028	6316929	He was the senior creative director at EA when he left.
6317669	6321089	NBA Jam is not the only thing he works on, but some other projects as well.
6322389	6327330	Apparently there were rumors about a return of NFL Blitz when this guy worked at Midway.
6328150	6331811	And then EA bought the Blitz property when Midway was going out of business.
6331911	6337512	But I don't know if that'll happen now or maybe it'll just happen without this guy overseeing the project anymore.
6338032	6339932	EA has confirmed his departure.
6340553	6342993	No word at what exactly he's going to help design at Zynga.
6344498	6366030	I don't know like I'm really trying to look at both sides about Zynga but don't does anyone else think Zynga's days are really numbered and it's not just about the whole like fact that their games are laughably bad when it comes to things like Farmville and so forth despite the fact that tons and tons of people play them but I feel like if Facebook goes down Zynga is fucked
6366810	6368170	Zynga has yet to establish.
6368210	6372931	I mean, I know they like to say in their press releases, well, people could just come to Zynga.com and play.
6372991	6373812	No one's going to do it.
6374612	6377712	You're not going to be nearly the company you are thanks to Facebook.
6378053	6381573	What if Google Plus rolls out games and says, you know what?
6382173	6388675	Since we don't like the Zynga games ever either and we've become the safe haven for nerds, we're not going to partner with Zynga.
6388955	6393296	Zynga is not allowed to put their games on Facebook or on Google Plus, excuse me.
6393576	6402784	or maybe Google Plus will come out and say sure we're going to have games but it's not showing up in the stream or it's not going to do the same thing that Facebook did where it shows up in feeds.
6403444	6405666	It'll be like how I think how Yahoo games were.
6406527	6407828	It was just its own section.
6408068	6408268	Right.
6408949	6410470	So you can go to that.
6410670	6412712	Yeah, it'll be how most people I think would prefer to see it.
6413032	6417416	Don't keep it off my stream but you can have some cool games in their own little game section.
6417456	6419117	I played Lexiolus for the longest time.
6419437	6419617	Right.
6419818	6420038	Yeah.
6421618	6422979	It's going to be very interesting.
6423859	6434683	And that's why I'm also glad to see PopCap didn't go with Zynga, although for Zynga's benefit, that would have been a huge win for them because at least PopCap can prove that they've done a bunch of other stuff in the other place.
6435183	6436844	So there's at least that.
6437764	6440125	All right, so let's move on with another story.
6440325	6441425	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
6442725	6446987	Well, what I have is actually a little bit more...
6453178	6453559	How's that?
6455159	6463204	EA is going to be doing another bit of online service shutdowns taking down a bunch of multiplayer games and demos.
6464264	6467306	So, Army of Two, bye.
6468948	6492082	TheDemo, Bye, Battlefield 2142, Bye, Battlefield 2, Modern Combat, Demo, Medal of Honor Airborne, Medal of Honor Heroes 2, NASCAR 09, NCAA Basketball 10, NCAA Football 10, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Need for Speed Undercover, Skate for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Tiger Woods, PGA Tour 10 and 11.
6493803	6499087	Those are all going down on August 11th And on October 1st, Madden NFL 10 and NHL 10
6502179	6505563	Sucks to be the guy that paid $10 to play those games online yesterday.
6505783	6506644	I know, bye.
6507224	6507665	I'm just kidding.
6507745	6522079	Obviously those games were out well before the whole $10 thing took off, but can't wait to see when the inevitable next wave of server shutdowns comes out and something that you paid $10 because you bought it used a couple years after the fact to play online suddenly shuts down.
6522760	6523040	I know.
6523080	6524162	That'll go over real well.
6524682	6528723	I mean, at least most of those games are like old sequels, you know what I mean?
6528743	6531124	Like they're old games and series that have newer sequels.
6532224	6533385	And they probably have a good point.
6533705	6535585	No one's playing those games online anymore.
6536425	6543227	So they're not exactly, people are going to cry over them, but it's going to be very interesting when we get to the $10 games.
6543808	6544088	Yeah.
6544468	6544888	There you go.
6546608	6546868	All right.
6547669	6548429	Loki, what do you have for us?
6549023	6549343	Ah, yes.
6549964	6554227	I mean, I hate when they shut down stuff.
6555027	6555768	This is kind of cool.
6557009	6560511	Now, I haven't really ever played this in the arcade, but I'm definitely familiar with the music.
6560952	6568957	Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune is coming to arcades, number four, that is, in December in Japan.
6569438	6575062	And I'm assuming we can expect more of the wonderful music in there.
6575782	6579603	Some of the stuff that they are going to be adding.
6580244	6581584	Connected Ghost Battle Mode.
6581984	6584285	So you'll be able to battle ghost records around the world.
6585045	6587386	And you can challenge the top ghosts in the world.
6589127	6589467	Let's see.
6589487	6590967	They're also going to have a team function.
6590987	6592188	You can create your own teams.
6592268	6594369	Put team-specific stickers on your cars.
6595189	6598290	And I'm not sure if that's going to make the international version.
6598350	6600531	New cars, including the Mazda RX-7.
6602032	6622850	Mitsubishi Starion, Nissan Skyline Coupe V36, Infiniti G37 Coupe, RUF CTR Yellowbird, RUF RGT, Subaru Legacy B4 5th Generation, Toyota Crown 13th Generation, and yet unannounced car.
6623270	6628074	Also some new courses, Yokohama Line and Yesu Route.
6628995	6629055	830HP
6647933	6669322	so uh that's kind of cool I mean I don't know I I know that there's definitely in the arcade scene nowadays it's all about racing games um I mean that's really popular so it'll be kind of cool hopefully this stuff makes it over here yeah it'd be nice uh as I was saying at the top of the show that's a pretty awesome racing series so I do hope we see that show up over here
6670953	6672535	Charles Smith, Professor of Family Studies, Kansas State University
6686874	6693478	He says that there's this big hysteria about violence in video games, but it's context and the type of game that's important.
6693838	6695499	The type of child is important as well.
6695539	6696820	Here's a quote.
6696940	6706086	A child without a connected parent relationship, one who doesn't have respect for their parents and plays a violent video game over a certain length of time, would worry me.
6706447	6709949	But banning video games completely isn't the right answer either.
6710850	6715653	He goes on to say that banning games might make them more attractive to children.
6716653	6720736	Quote, the realism in video games is changing constantly because of technology.
6721076	6726760	This causes more realistic violence and video games are becoming more and more immersive in terms of their nature.
6727140	6732403	And he's talking about how, you know, the technology is always changing and this can kind of be a concern.
6732443	6739047	But ultimately, at the end of the day, he says that parents, they need to be educated, they need to be aware about what games they're letting their children play.
6739407	6741629	Without that parent-child relationship...
6742369	6743189	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
6769435	6770576	He knows what he's talking about.
6770817	6771257	Seriously.
6771277	6779104	We need him to go against Leland Yee in what is needed for kids and so forth.
6781466	6781767	All right.
6782828	6787052	Let's move on with the mailbag and see what offensive things you guys are going to email us this week.
6789423	6795147	Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com is the place to email us every week and DarkSakura will dive in head first and read some emails for us.
6795968	6796628	I will.
6797069	6797609	I have some.
6797989	6799150	I have four emails.
6800351	6801552	Oh my god, four?
6802313	6802733	Just kidding.
6805900	6808681	But first of all, person, you misspelled Voltaire.
6808801	6810521	It's V-O-L-T-A-I-R-E.
6811342	6814923	So if you're going to quote somebody, which, quoting Voltaire is fine by me.
6815223	6816283	Make sure you spell it right, please.
6817143	6818804	Mailbag, hi, we haven't spoken in a while.
6818864	6820004	I just wanted to let you in on this.
6820204	6823045	I came ahead quite a bit since I started a week ago.
6823125	6823905	Just have a read.
6825366	6826486	Isn't that a spam email?
6826706	6827026	No.
6828847	6830387	I'm telling you that's a spam email.
6830608	6833708	You've got to watch out for that shit.
6833728	6835369	We get tons of spam in the email box.
6836010	6862814	well I I should just ignore bad grammar anyway okay hello comrades I'm sorry it's funny that that still was signed with something that they're quoting a philosopher I find that funny I'm sorry three emails hello comrades I hope that all of you are doing well firstly I wanted to thank you for the great show very entertaining just like shooting an AK while intoxicated just joking I don't drink
6864454	6867236	What do you guys think of the future of GTA?
6867256	6869758	Will the next installment be as serious and realistic, a.k.a.
6869878	6871399	gray and muddy as the previous one?
6871959	6876762	Or will it perhaps return to a much more hilarious style like San Andreas with much more customization and humor?
6877903	6880104	This is really a Loki question, if anything.
6880665	6885388	Loki, I know you're rocking out over there, but Grand Theft Auto, what would the next one be like?
6885408	6886669	Would it be serious or whimsical?
6887585	6892127	I think that they're going to try to bring back what they did in San Andreas.
6892207	6901230	Basically, kind of keeping it grounded a little bit, but have a little bit of extra fun stuff like the miniguns and the parachutes and a little bit of ridiculous stuff.
6901570	6914174	I think they've got to step it up a little bit as far as whimsical and crazy because of Saints Row the Third, but I still think they're going to try to keep it a little bit somewhat realistic, you know?
6915476	6918142	I think you're definitely going to see kind of like a Sandra is.
6919926	6920167	Alrighty.
6922747	6948944	I just hope they get rid of the I kind of call it like dating your friends where oh hey let's go bowling or hey I want to go play air hockey I don't want to fucking play air hockey with you I want ho mode DarkSakura I'm with you I want more hoes I want ho mode where you play as a whore I think there needs to be a mode where when she says I want to go play air hockey you should say shut up bitch and suck my dick
6949372	6949632	See?
6950192	6950832	And you know what?
6951113	6957155	And this is why Saints Row, in some ways, is a better game than Grand Theft Auto.
6957715	6960576	Saints Row 2 does have whore mode, where you can play as a whore.
6960816	6964597	You can be a man whore, and you can go... Oh my god, why am I not playing this game?
6965197	6966017	It's serious.
6966297	6967478	It's one of the side missions you can do.
6967498	6970159	I played the first Saints Row and I was like, yeah, whatever.
6970179	6971639	No, you need to play Saints Row 2.
6972319	6972920	Can I borrow it?
6974200	6974400	Yeah.
6974660	6975681	I need to be a man-whore.
6975701	6976621	That's awesome.
6976841	6977861	It's a fucking awesome game.
6977881	6981562	You can borrow it when you lend me Dance Masters.
6982043	6982343	Shut up.
6983383	6984063	Shut up, bitch.
6984363	6985404	See, I'm practicing.
6985424	6985824	Hey-ho.
6985904	6989165	Did you play as a man-whore?
6989485	6990685	Big Bang Bar A Little More To The Left
7012532	7025675	But it's seriously, they have scenes where they have a mode where, I don't even remember what the hell it's called, it's basically you in one of those bunny suits, you know how they have the bunny suits, Intel and stuff like that?
7026055	7030076	Right in ATV, on fire, and everything you run into explodes!
7030436	7032277	It's just such an awesome game!
7032737	7033157	Oh, God.
7033277	7040442	If this game convinced Loki to get a gold star in man-whoring, I've got to check it out.
7040843	7041843	I'll loan it to you.
7041923	7042804	It's pretty awesome.
7042904	7046206	But the third, man, the third's going to be even better than this.
7047387	7049409	I can't fathom how awesome this is going to be.
7049529	7049929	Can't wait.
7052099	7052339	All right.
7052679	7053539	Was there more to the email?
7053559	7053779	Sorry.
7053819	7054360	Yes, there is.
7054380	7055740	We're stuck thinking about hosts.
7055800	7058881	I also want to inform you guys of this great game I played as a kid.
7058981	7060021	It's called Dark Earth.
7060141	7063942	Okay, I want to see how old this is if he said he played it as a kid.
7066242	7068783	Actually, it links to something in archaeology.
7068843	7069223	Never mind.
7069343	7069943	Oh, the video game.
7071064	7071524	I'll find it.
7071564	7071844	Hold on.
7072064	7075265	Post-apocalyptic action adventure game for the PC.
7075345	7076285	When did it come out?
7079586	7080686	It was canceled for PS2.
7084113	7100102	Dark Earth, 1997 September 30th, 1997 You were a kid in 97, shut the fuck up I'm not reading any more of this Don't be mean to the emailers It featured an amazing story and the graphics were pretty impressive at the time If you have the time, check it out, you won't regret it Stay frost, comrades, Stanislav
7102749	7103470	I'm reading up on this game.
7103490	7104390	I've actually never played this.
7104430	7105591	It was a PC only game.
7105671	7107292	I remember this game actually.
7107332	7107872	I've seen it before.
7107892	7108392	Do you really?
7108892	7109633	I never played this.
7110593	7114135	Third person game centering around item collection and weapon based combat.
7115656	7120539	The environments of the game were pre-rendered with 3D modeled characters moving atop them like Resident Evil.
7122480	7122900	Interesting.
7123274	7123854	It was pretty neat.
7124735	7125796	I will have to check it out.
7126256	7130198	Next email comes from... Thanks for the game, by the way.
7131879	7132380	The next one.
7132400	7134241	No, I was saying thanks for the game.
7134661	7135601	I read the damn email.
7139984	7142725	Did any of you see the Forza 4 trailer on Xbox Live?
7142865	7143005	No.
7143545	7145186	I watched it and it starts with this claim.
7145386	7146406	All in-game footage.
7146666	7153468	Then, unless I'm wrong, it shows you the CG render intro to the game followed by footage from the game which I'm not sure looks any different than Forza 3.
7154129	7159090	CG renders are not in-game footage even if they are part of the game media.
7159611	7165072	The only way that could be in-game footage is if there was a special car viewer section that does nothing else.
7165673	7166993	I wonder if that is what it is.
7170584	7174206	Was that the one that blasted the Kanye West song when you watched the trailer?
7174226	7174806	I didn't watch it.
7175046	7177227	I did see it.
7177287	7182170	Racing games always have, at least these days, have pretty impressive graphics.
7182210	7184571	A lot of it goes by so fast you can't really appreciate it.
7185252	7191355	I also have to paste how Rob signed his email because you'll only get it if you know DOS.
7192256	7192616	Oh God.
7193868	7194348	That's great.
7194488	7194868	I like that.
7194928	7195309	I love it.
7195829	7198310	And to read it out for the listeners, 10 print, Rob.
7199351	7200071	20 print, B.
7200731	7201231	30, go to 20.
7201692	7202952	By the way, that's basic, not DOS.
7203212	7204073	Sorry, you know what I mean.
7204193	7204673	Just so you know.
7206334	7209015	I have an icon that says the home sweet home one.
7210022	7212965	I spent a lot of time on Commodore 64 Basic in my youth.
7213665	7216127	Meanwhile, you kids were playing Dark Earth.
7216308	7217689	When I was a kid, I was typing.
7217729	7218910	What were the commands?
7219110	7226316	Run, quote, game, quote, comma, eight, comma, no, asterisk, A, asterisk, B.
7227421	7228883	Dark Earth Dark Earth Dark Earth Dark Earth
7243803	7246564	I used to have one of those that you play games on.
7247624	7249385	Okay, last email.
7249465	7250785	Dun, dun, dun.
7252325	7252885	Hello, gang.
7252985	7255606	This is Ramaditya.
7256426	7257367	I hope I said that right.
7257867	7263368	I spoke to Rob earlier, and as a blind gamer, I would like to give my personal thoughts about one of the topics brought up in the last show.
7263928	7267729	It is about an invention that can help blind persons see, use, and connect as assistive device.
7267990	7269130	I asked for an email like this.
7269210	7269470	Hooray.
7270083	7274044	However, because my English vocabularies are somewhat limited, I'll try to explain it as best I can.
7274104	7275185	I hope you can catch what I mean.
7275705	7276845	This is what I understand.
7277266	7281227	In order to make the connect work, it needs to recognize the visual objects it points to.
7281647	7288990	For example, if I want to know that there is a glass in front of me, I must point my connect to it, and an audio message will tell me there is a glass.
7289610	7297413	It means that my connect must have proper information about the object so that it can recognize it properly, so the object must contain something special that the connect can recognize.
7298033	7303395	With this aid, we are faced with the circumstance that visual objects are a lot, color, shape, letters, etc.
7303955	7307917	So it is probably impossible for the device to recognize all of them.
7308457	7314339	For example, if I stand in front of the mall, it will be difficult for the device to identify various activities in front of me.
7314659	7316780	Walking people, running children, moving trolley, etc.
7317780	7324402	So the device may not be able to replace working eyes, but there is still a way to make the device useful and more effectively.
7324982	7328644	We need a specific object that can universally be recognized.
7329044	7331845	What a coincidence that the idea came from Rob himself.
7332185	7333545	Well, QR code can be one.
7334005	7338467	That's basically QR code usually contains text or number, and those are universal, e.g.
7338527	7345169	the numbers are number 9 is the same around the world, letter A is also the same, and many other examples that you can make yourself.
7345829	7350093	So we use the device like a reading tool or transportation recognizer, and it's like what Rob told.
7350513	7356698	When it scans the QR code attached to the bus, it would speak, bus to Canada goes at 7 a.m.
7357599	7361782	Another example, the inventor can install a small GPS so that it can help blind people navigate easily.
7362143	7369749	You are facing north, the device says, and when you walk straight, it finds a QR code embedded at the next exit door that will read, northern exit, go south to Dunkin' Donuts.
7371029	7379592	If you want to implement Kinect as a gaming device which is accessible for the blind, perhaps bodily movement can be considered as a universal target that the device can recognize.
7380052	7390275	Perhaps when you play one-on-one lightsaber battle, both players can face each other and use Kinect like a lightsaber, and the device held by the blind player can inform the position or movement his or her opponent makes.
7390695	7392836	Combined with the sound effects from the game, it can be great.
7393916	7400641	Another possible implementation is to use the device in card games like, well I forget, but there was that one PS3 one which came out with the physical cards.
7401602	7401702	Oh.
7402442	7402982	I have judgment.
7403183	7403463	Yeah.
7404583	7409046	That was the one where you all bet if I could sell one million and Loki must dress as Tingle?
7409427	7410127	Yes, correct.
7410527	7418993	The physical cards must contain label or QR code that tells Kinect which cards the player holds so the player can use it properly based on information given by Kinect.
7419033	7422896	For example, this is dragon card facing up, this is golem card facing down, etc.
7423856	7428060	Yep, that's my personal thought about the topic, but I do support whatever result may come out.
7428780	7431863	Okay, before I conclude this email, let me give you my YouTube video.
7431903	7433604	It's me playing Frog's Theme with my recorder.
7434204	7436606	Hope you and all you listeners can enjoy it.
7437587	7439508	Didn't he send us a recorder link before?
7439568	7440269	I think I remember this guy.
7440329	7441390	I'm going to copy it to you, Rob.
7441570	7442130	Okay, do that.
7442391	7443351	I'll bring it up here real quick.
7443912	7444052	Okay.
7446923	7456806	Well, first off, I think if I understood the point of the email correctly, it was that I'm a genius for my idea with the QR codes last week, so I totally agree with the email 100%, might I say.
7457246	7457907	You're so awful.
7458687	7463688	And I do have to say, if English isn't your first language, you still did a fantastic job.
7464289	7466189	I know, you did better than some people who email us.
7466229	7470590	You did better than people who have grown up here all of their lives, so thank you for being awesome.
7470790	7471971	Let me bring this up a little bit.
7483487	7486488	I love that because you know he's got a deep appreciation for this game.
7486508	7492051	Because I want to say the last video I saw of him playing the recorder was like Scars of Time, I think it was.
7492471	7492931	I think so.
7492951	7494812	So clearly this kid loves his chrono.
7494832	7496273	He played it with the music and everything.
7496393	7497674	Yeah, he loves his chrono.
7497714	7502236	And it's great that even though he's blind, he kind of has that appreciation.
7502636	7508278	And I think it's hard for a lot of us to understand sometimes what it's like in that position.
7508899	7509019	Yeah.
7510940	7515121	But certainly, I can also agree that kind of what he says at the end of the email.
7515181	7520283	Hey, anything that will help is a good thing, right?
7520543	7533349	Well, see, this is kind of actually... It's funny because I was actually having this thought about the use of QR codes to provide...
7536107	7537528	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7560408	7569516	or even like an iPhone app that you can hold up your phone, read the code, and it'll have a speaker attached to it that says so-and-so or record voice signal or something.
7571118	7571498	What do you think?
7572339	7575682	I think we have all these technologies now, like the QR code.
7576342	7579585	GPS is so cheap to implement in devices now, too.
7579765	7581907	I think we're just a matter of time away.
7582007	7588331	I have to tell you, though, and I'd actually like to get some of our blind listeners' feedback on this, too.
7589172	7598119	I watched a special probably a couple years ago about using audio location to be able to tell distance.
7599881	7610494	It was a guy blind from birth riding a bicycle down a street that had cars all around, people crossing the street, and making clicking noises.
7611315	7615800	And he was able to tell his location and what was close to him by the clicking sound.
7616541	7617923	And I was thinking, you know...
7619144	7619945	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7636879	7637039	Wow.
7637099	7637539	Crazy thought.
7637559	7637700	Yeah.
7657506	7662912	By the way, just real quick, some folks are requesting the video so that they could watch it at full volume.
7662972	7664193	So there's a link right there in chat.
7664233	7664974	I put that there.
7665374	7670059	Sorry to those folks that are listening on the podcast feed, but you'll just have to do a search for that.
7670800	7671781	What was it labeled as?
7672942	7674704	Let me see what it's labeled as real quick here.
7675748	7676889	Was that the last email, by the way?
7676989	7677429	Yes, it was.
7677449	7678389	All right, that was the last email.
7680771	7690536	The name on YouTube is Ramaditya Skywalker, R-A-M-A-D-I-T-Y-A Skywalker, S-K-Y-W-A-L-K-E-R.
7691016	7691517	So there you go.
7691557	7698640	You can look that up, and I'm sure, I think he probably has, it's 61 videos, so who knows what else is in there, but I'm assuming there's a lot of recorder stuff in there.
7699101	7699641	So check that out.
7701007	7703988	I see, yeah, Tin Whistle, Ship, yeah, he's got some other videos too.
7704008	7704708	I have a Tin Whistle.
7704728	7705308	I have two of them.
7705849	7706709	But I'm not any good at it.
7708490	7708890	Very cool.
7709590	7710810	I should learn to play my melodica.
7710870	7712231	Maybe we could do a YouTube duet.
7712251	7712731	Do a duet?
7713211	7713611	That'd be awesome.
7715612	7716852	Alright, that's it for the Mailbag.
7716892	7721334	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send in your emails for a future week.
7721634	7723955	Meanwhile, let's get to the FUs of the week.
7740675	7748940	I would like to say F you to my skin for not getting quite as much sun as I wanted today.
7751102	7755344	But I am happy to say that I don't have skin cancer yet.
7756705	7757185	And yeah.
7760131	7761052	F you to people being sick.
7784392	7808446	uh my fu of the week goes to this microphone because i think it's dying and i really don't want to buy another microphone but fine if that's what i have to do i will uh and um fu to i don't know my skin too my skin sucks too like i have the whole like this is gonna be gross but i have like the whole like flaky thing going on in some parts this is gross i hate it i know i use i use similar stuff i do but it only lasts so long and then it's like
7810185	7814426	Well, the reason why I'm actually, and I hate to plug.
7814486	7816007	An F you to the outro playing right there.
7816027	7818648	To plug, you know, because they're not paying us clearly.
7819208	7825610	But since I started using, I'm using the Hoofmaker stuff, and it actually made the eczema on my knuckles go away.
7826230	7827510	Funny enough, my hands are fine.
7827610	7829011	My hands, never a problem.
7829031	7830451	In fact, I get a lot of compliments on my hands.
7830471	7831391	But I've started using it on my knees.
7832312	7833792	And it, I'm just saying, it helps.
7833812	7834152	There you go.
7834812	7836373	All right, well, anyhow, let's move on.
7838257	7841838	A couple quick stories for you guys in the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7842618	7842858	Loki?
7842878	7843818	You know, it's funny.
7843838	7849819	I was just watching video for some of the Saints Row 3rd stuff just because it's fun watching the video over and over and over again.
7850840	7859001	They announced their Hyper Ordinary Pre-Order Pack, and this will be included with games that you pre-order, I'm assuming, anywhere.
7859081	7861782	But, you know, it...
7863302	7864443	Maybe just certain outlets.
7864583	7868025	But it's Professor Genki's Hyper Ordinary Pre-Order Pack.
7868525	7869885	It gets you a few things.
7869925	7877769	The Professor Genki suit, which Professor Genki, if you don't know about the game, it's this weird...
7879750	7879950	I get it.
7879970	7880490	A catapult.
7903681	7904722	No, it's a manapult.
7905823	7910368	You can suck pedestrians up into the cannon and fire them out.
7911690	7919158	And then, of course, there's a weapon that's an octopus gun that fires octopuses that land on people's heads.
7922381	7936270	And if that's not crazy enough for you, they have the platinum pack that's available, which I'm seriously considering buying this, that comes with a headset that auto-tunes your voice automatically.
7937930	7939291	That's kind of worth it in the price of there.
7939531	7943032	And as well as the soundtrack, and I'm sure some other fun bonuses in there as well.
7943613	7947234	Of course, the headset does not work with Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network.
7948375	7951856	Well, it does, but you have to buy a little adapter.
7951976	7952616	But you know what?
7952717	7955458	It's still worth it to have a headset that auto-tunes your voice.
7955538	7957339	That might be worth it just for this show.
7957419	7959299	I could do a whole show auto-tuned.
7960780	7968283	You know, it's funny that the subject of Auto-Tune came up on last night's Under Sedation Live, and you've got to check out this app on the iPhone.
7968343	7975426	It's called Songify, and it's an app where you can make instant songs out of whatever.
7975586	7978847	God, I don't want to rip off the bit from USL, but I feel like now I have to demo it.
7979167	7979928	Oh, do it.
7979948	7980188	That's fine.
7980448	7982809	So here's Songify, and what should I sing about?
7982849	7983529	Tell me what to sing about.
7984369	7986010	Sing about hemorrhoids.
7987331	7988072	Okay.
7988592	7989893	No, I'm not going to sing about hemorrhoids.
7989913	7990613	That's gross.
7991154	7992755	Sing about... I'll sing a song about Loki.
7992775	7993635	Sing about Lady Gaga.
7994016	7994856	No, I'll sing a song about Loki.
7994876	7995096	Okay.
7995457	7995777	Here we go.
7998359	8008606	Loki went to Round Table Pizza and got a pizza with cheese and pepperoni but no bacon.
8008626	8010787	Okay, so now it's going to do its thing.
8010927	8011588	So here we go.
8013358	8014579	Oh, hold on.
8015319	8015880	I did it wrong.
8015920	8017041	It wasn't recording that whole time.
8017081	8017521	Hold on.
8018422	8019043	Live radio.
8019163	8019884	I know, live radio.
8019904	8020204	Shut up.
8020264	8020484	Hold on.
8020504	8020804	Here we go.
8021425	8021745	Here we go.
8023467	8026710	Loki went to Roundtable Pizza.
8027390	8031053	He didn't get the bacon pizza because bacon makes you fat.
8031073	8033836	Okay, here we go.
8036894	8054061	Loki went to Roundtable Pizza He didn't get the bacon pizza Because bacon makes you fat Pizza He didn't get the bacon pizza Because bacon makes you fat
8058137	8072616	Loki, went to Roundtable, Loki, went to Roundtable Pizza So obviously it's not perfect because, you know, it kind of cuts out a little bit there, but this duo is awesome.
8073016	8073998	Songify, you said?
8074058	8075179	Yeah, Songify, it's free.
8075780	8076501	Download it.
8076701	8080282	I guess the way they make money is you can download other add-ons and so forth.
8080322	8083103	Like for instance, I just got one that says, sounds like you can sing.
8083203	8084484	Have you tried La Di Da?
8084564	8086464	Rumor is Kesha uses it to sing better.
8087385	8088365	Cute little things like that.
8088625	8089585	Oh, I have to tell you.
8089986	8091806	You know how we talked about the blow video?
8092546	8097128	I found out who the director was and he did some other videos that are freaking hilarious.
8097808	8099729	This guy is like amazing.
8100009	8103552	I know, well, that was the director.
8103652	8105113	We found the director's other videos.
8105133	8105674	That's awesome.
8106074	8107275	So, anyway, I had to say that.
8107736	8108096	Alright.
8108116	8112760	It was me and Becky and Susan in here just watching the hell out of these.
8112880	8113461	It was so funny.
8115342	8119063	Alright, one more story for you guys here, and it has to do with sports games.
8119083	8125784	It's more of an opinion piece, but since we're a little short on news tonight, I thought I'd... By the way, I'm loving these comments in chat right now.
8125984	8128365	People trying to vote for that song in the cage match.
8128405	8129725	You can't vote for that song.
8129805	8130165	Stop it.
8130185	8130605	What's it called?
8130625	8131166	Songify?
8131666	8132326	Songify.
8132786	8135566	S-O-N-G-I-F-I-Y or something like that.
8136547	8136947	Alright, anyhow.
8139615	8141616	Why you should stop hating on sports games.
8141656	8156081	It's an opinion piece that came from VentureBeat.com and talks about why sports games, you know, a lot of the masses tend to hate on sports games because it's roster update and it's another fucking Madden games coming out.
8156121	8157482	Who buys those games anyway, right?
8157972	8169176	Well, a sports guru for Electronic Arts says as part of this story, quote, "...the point of our games is not reenacting throwing a football, but the spirit of the sport and letting gamers fulfill their sports dreams.
8169516	8170537	These are real players.
8170577	8172578	There are real events, and there is real angst.
8172898	8174638	We want to reenact reality."
8175499	8184182	The opinion piece goes on to talk about how sports games have a role in driving forward innovation for the entire video game industry, and that's why you should take them seriously.
8185482	8193624	I guess goes on to talk about NBA 2K11, the game that reenacts some of basketball's finest moments because that was the one that brought back Jordan in there.
8196105	8204927	I guess saying that some people were too young to experience that back in 92, but the video game helps them relive an experience that they actually missed the first time around.
8205727	8212009	The games include tons and tons of commentary from people that actually commentate on sports in the real industry.
8212589	8234619	and I think a lot that kind of went through this as well and it talked about that I thought made a good point is having to re-up the reality of these games every year the opinion piece from VentureBeat.com says sports games are a main source of revenue for electronic arts so a lot of the innovation in terms of graphics and realistic physics happens in that department and trickles down to other games
8235559	8240680	EA, for example, uses the collision engines originally built for Madden in games like Battlefield 3.
8241541	8248422	Each year, those teams build and rebuild physics and animation engines for their in-game characters, and then other games reap the rewards of those engines.
8249482	8255704	Physics and animation in our very core games has been very driven by sports games since the inception of the technology.
8256204	8280063	that physics and animation had to be in a sports games for many years shooters didn't need it and then it goes on to talk about artificial intelligence is a big part of that as well when you play against sports teams and then the sports franchise did start this whole once a year cycle but World of Warcraft does the same thing Calls of Duty, Modern Warfare DDR I would throw out there again and
8281124	8281826	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8289140	8292901	I think that you have to appeal to everyone's fandoms.
8293121	8300084	Not every guy out there is going to like to play the RPGs.
8301184	8303905	Not every girl out there is going to like to play adventure games.
8304145	8307026	They've got a market there.
8307266	8310847	Sports especially, well actually really all over the world.
8311667	8315148	Football is such a big thing in Europe.
8315188	8317749	I'm talking about real football, not the shit we call football here.
8318885	8320206	That's an opinion, young lady.
8320386	8323048	I know, and I'm talking about an opinion piece, so I'm giving my opinion.
8323248	8324109	Fine, fine.
8324149	8324749	Don't judge me.
8325450	8326250	Judging a little bit.
8326610	8326931	Sorry.
8327651	8328171	Counter-judge.
8331274	8333435	But it's important, yeah.
8333455	8334656	First of all, it's a source of revenue.
8335276	8341541	That means that for every Madden game EA puts out, we get another Sims.
8342822	8345624	So it's a necessary evil.
8346184	8347445	I don't have to like it.
8348561	8353705	Going to our chatroom at chat.orange.com, TigerClaw says, So all the nerds are complaining about sports games.
8353825	8357728	Don't they realize that some of the most beloved video games are sports games that nerds enjoy?
8357868	8359549	Blades of Steel, Mario Kart, anyone?
8360390	8364213	You know, I posted about this to my Google+, and I got some really interesting comments.
8364413	8368536	And because I didn't say that I would read them on air, I don't want to read them verbatim on air.
8369557	8371058	But I will just kind of summarize.
8371218	8372940	One comment that I thought was very interesting was about
8373400	8398793	Somebody who said, you know, I really enjoy the sports games, especially the football games And why I like them is that I can't really play sports games Or I can't play football IRL I can't play professional football because I'm a tall skinny dude I'm not built for professional football These games let me live out that experience And that kind of ties into what the beginning of that article said How, you know, it's about letting folks kind of
8399953	8402154	Reenact an experience, I guess you could say.
8402194	8404014	And I could see the same thing with basketball.
8404334	8408255	You know, you have to be a very certain body type to be able to really play competitive basketball.
8408415	8411996	It's the same reason why people do fantasy football and whatever.
8412336	8412796	Right, Loki?
8413276	8417197	I still think, though, they're dodging the actual problem with sports games.
8417557	8419758	And I'm not even just going to limit it to sports games.
8419798	8425319	It can be a lot of games that feel that they need to release a new title in the franchise every year.
8425679	8429000	It's the fact that they don't change very much year to year.
8429660	8436462	So that still didn't address the fact that when people call it just a roster update, they tweak a few things to make things more realistic.
8436863	8437483	Good for you.
8437783	8439824	Why does that justify another $60?
8439944	8445225	Because I don't really think that you went back to the ground level and rebuilt the whole game from scratch.
8445626	8449527	I think that you're just tweaking it a little bit to make it a little bit better.
8449887	8450447	But you know what?
8450507	8454989	Tweaks like that can be done to older games and then patched in.
8455169	8458390	I don't understand why you need to release a game every year.
8458869	8465215	What about the idea of just throwing it out there that sports games set the bar so to speak that other games end up using?
8466696	8469398	The whole physics and engine being used in Call of Duty.
8469438	8469898	They don't, though.
8471379	8472520	I don't think that they do.
8473041	8476463	I mean, I've seen... Well, the guy from Electronic Arts said.
8477003	8478044	Oh, I'm sorry.
8478104	8479225	He's not biased at all.
8480005	8491333	Electronic Arts, a company that makes a ton of its money off of sports games, and they have some of the largest sports franchises out there, would totally not be skewed towards sports games at all.
8491954	8493114	He's going to say, well, you're right.
8493175	8494976	Our games aren't very realistic at all.
8496218	8500808	Every bit of game research, no matter the type of game, can benefit.
8502291	8504917	For example, if you want a realistic...
8506570	8507691	Physics, for example.
8508071	8511894	A sports game actually is a really good judge of doing realistic physics.
8511994	8518378	For example, you want to know how fully inflated basketball is going to bounce on a certain type of floor with a certain type of push.
8519318	8520659	You have to program all that in.
8521280	8525442	You know, say that you take that into, like, for example, Sims.
8526103	8529205	And they do, suddenly they have, like, you can play basketball in Sims.
8529805	8530045	Okay.
8530406	8533948	But, I mean, say that at the same time you take, like...
8536049	8537831	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
8552808	8553889	Thanks for watching!
8568979	8569920	Thanks for watching!
8586609	8589331	No one can jump like 50 feet in the air and stuff like that.
8589411	8592673	I mean, there's a little bit of fantasy there.
8593193	8601138	But, I mean, if they really want super realistic games, then why aren't they building Madden in the Crytek engine or Unreal 3 or something like that?
8601558	8610124	Hell, there was Backbreaker, a game that had really realistic physics, and that sports game didn't sell very well at all.
8610764	8611805	And I think that...
8613205	8619567	You know, people, yeah, I understand there's a lot of people that, oh, I can't play real sports, so I'm going to play this game.
8619767	8620308	That's fine.
8620548	8624229	I can't drive a race car, but I'll still drive a car and a game.
8624309	8627790	I can't go murder people, but I'll still play a game like that.
8628970	8634894	Let me read some comments from chat because the chat room is lighting up on this story and I think there's some really excellent comments in the chat room here.
8634954	8635935	From all sides of the spectrum.
8636275	8637976	Xenacore says, Rob, that's bull crap.
8638517	8642339	The updates they do to the engine are no better than patches.
8642720	8645221	You really don't get your money's worth if you keep up year to year.
8645581	8649424	How often do your other examples charge full price for an incremental update?
8650225	8657009	Breakroom in chat says, I couldn't play in the NFL because I would pee myself if I saw some guy like Ray Lewis looking at me like he's going to kill me.
8657129	8658010	He just might kill me.
8658730	8661331	Every NFL game I have played has been different in some way.
8661651	8663231	Sometimes there are slight differences.
8663871	8666792	DarkTetsuya says, Yeah, that's why I love Need for Speed.
8667172	8670552	Legally, I can't really drive, but I've always grown up loving cars.
8670892	8676553	In games like that, let me imagine what it's like driving an expensive car I'll never own really freaking fast.
8676913	8678494	That's a really good analogy there.
8678754	8682915	Breakroom also says, I love Dragon Quest games, and I will buy the next Dragon Quest game.
8683235	8684775	How much have those games really changed?
8684915	8685215	Well...
8685755	8686075	Hold on.
8686095	8692218	To be fair, you do have a whole new story, new characters, new environments, new maps.
8693059	8700463	I don't know if I really follow the DQ analogy because they're completely different stories.
8700563	8701103	Here's the thing.
8701523	8703925	And let's talk about sports games here.
8704045	8705066	NCAA football.
8705126	8715953	One of the big updates this year was all the pre-game rituals, like the different mascots coming across the field and the little tweaks and stuff like that.
8716593	8721216	All stuff that you would say, yes, lends to the experience, but not necessarily the gameplay.
8721657	8730943	I don't think that the fact that the mascot looks realistic and does whatever the mascot does normally in the game lends itself to playing a better football game.
8731643	8732844	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
8761850	8762511	And you know what?
8763411	8765713	Yeah, I'd say the same thing with Modern Warfare.
8766053	8768334	I don't think that they really need to release a new game each year.
8768634	8771536	To their credit, though, at least there's a new storyline that goes along with it.
8771616	8772977	So there's a little bit of something.
8773037	8781881	But sports games, though, you don't need to write a new story for it.
8781961	8782742	It's a sports game.
8782782	8784043	Unless it's wrestling.
8785063	8789187	I think the gaming community rejected music games doing this.
8790368	8795412	Our opinion with DDR and such is a little bit skewed because those were games we really loved.
8795773	8799936	But games like Guitar Hero failed because the market was too saturated with them.
8800336	8811006	Rock Band, essentially Harmonix has said, you know what, we need to take a break from Rock Band because Rock Band 3 unfortunately didn't sell well because there were just so many Rock Band games coming out.
8811366	8816307	So I think sometimes these yearly update games get rejected by the marketplace.
8816587	8821849	Anyway, I want to read a couple other comments from chat and then go to our phone lines because I'm sure folks want to call in on this.
8822429	8823889	Quickly, DarkSakura, before I go to chat.
8824089	8829711	Okay, well I was actually, there is an exception to the rule when it comes to the sports games and I really think it's the wrestling games.
8831011	8833192	So that makes sense to me.
8859557	8862383	Alright, let me go to the chatroom at chat.orangelaunchery.com for a couple more comments.
8862684	8867454	DDR Dollar Bill in our chatroom says, I can't drive real cars, but doing it online was awesome.
8867675	8869639	Oh, and flying sims are fantastic.
8870185	8890247	You know, I gotta say, even though I might talk about, eh, I don't play a lot of sports games I don't play a lot of Madden because I'm not super into football I don't play a lot of basketball games because I'm not super into it Although it is the sport I probably enjoy more than most others And I do love NBA Jam, the old one I'm not as big on the new one, but I'm curious about this whole arcade one they're putting out, you know
8890709	8912963	Super high impact But one thing, one game I love are racing games I love a lot of those racing games But I usually like the arcade racers more than I like the realistic ones Like I can't do Forza, I can't do Gran Turismo But I loved Blur, I like Mario Kart I really loved F-Zero I will always love F-Zero What about Initial D?
8914235	8916757	Sports games have been around since the first arcade game.
8916777	8917037	Pong.
8917057	8917717	Basically tennis.
8934588	8935068	Interesting.
8935469	8936169	Interesting point.
8936269	8936730	I like that.
8937851	8940373	And then, let's see, one other comment.
8940393	8940994	What did I want to say?
8941334	8947619	Break Room says, I love sports games, but when I have ever tried to play in real sports, I was never any good.
8948100	8953024	A skinny white guy doesn't line up well in high school sports, but give me a controller and it's fun to pretend.
8954385	8958709	SSJ100 Matt says, Listen, I've been a hockey fan for most of my life and used to play when I was younger.
8959069	8963333	I love the game of hockey so much that I gladly pay for the yearly update NHL games.
8963713	8969799	I enjoy playing the game because it's the closest I can get to playing with my favorite players and favorite teams than I can possibly ever get.
8970139	8977005	I would gladly pay the yearly $60 cost to play the game that I truly enjoy watching, playing, and being a fan of.
8978630	8979170	We'll see you next time.
9008038	9014122	Again, we're going to go to the phone here, but while we wait for the calls to come in, I will ask Loki quickly if he has any last-minute stories he wants to share with us.
9014802	9015963	I don't know if there's anything that came up.
9016023	9017404	I don't think it was a very busy Newsweek.
9017784	9018945	We might have hit on it all.
9019285	9019686	It wasn't.
9019726	9025009	There is a... There may have been one thing or two that we hadn't hit up on.
9026010	9027671	I'm trying to remember how long they were, though.
9028171	9029172	Looking it up real quick here.
9030733	9031513	Let's see.
9033595	9033715	Um...
9038601	9040203	I know there was something that we missed.
9040343	9044067	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9044547	9046389	Maybe you know the story that Loki missed.
9046690	9047531	All right, it's coming up.
9047551	9048111	I have a story.
9048672	9048872	What?
9049593	9051815	Actually, I do have a last minute story, but we'll wait until after this call.
9051835	9052756	Yeah, let's do the call.
9053597	9054678	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9054718	9055079	Who's this?
9055760	9057221	Yo, guys, it's Xenacore from the OKC.
9057261	9057862	How y'all doing?
9057922	9058763	Hey, Xenacore.
9058803	9060224	How's it going in the OKC?
9061044	9062224	Man, I'm pissed off, man.
9062444	9068966	I went off to work, I set my DVR to record the World Cup, and of course it stopped recording right before the shootout.
9069406	9072066	Although I know how it ended, I didn't get to see how it ended.
9072326	9078728	Oh my god, you missed the... It's so funny about soccer games that come down to that.
9079508	9083629	That whole five minutes is like the entire game right there.
9083969	9084509	That sucks.
9085109	9088732	It gets right before they start running out on the field, and it's like, this is the end of the recording.
9088772	9090553	It's like, oh, you bastard, I'll kill you.
9090773	9091414	Sorry to hear it.
9091454	9092735	Well, how is OKC these days?
9092775	9094797	That's a city I haven't been to since I was 17.
9095477	9096318	It's hot, man.
9097499	9103503	I feel like going through the whole Good Morning Vietnam rant about it being too hot in Vietnam, but I'll tell you the truth.
9103603	9106125	But, you know, after you've been in 130, 100's nothing.
9106425	9109368	All right, well, I guess we should bring it back to games, though.
9109448	9111069	So what's on your mind about the gaming world today?
9112224	9116145	I've been sort of preparing for Dark Souls the best way I can.
9116165	9118766	That's why I put Demon's Souls back in my machine.
9119146	9120766	That's a game I need to go back and play more of.
9120826	9122767	Demon's Souls is so unkind, though.
9123367	9124747	That game is just not nice.
9125388	9127388	Well, this time I'm backing myself up with the wiki.
9129109	9132930	The Demon's Souls wiki, they put so much information in that thing, it's ridiculous.
9133410	9134450	Now there's a plan.
9135010	9136312	So now all I have to do is survive it.
9136672	9141297	Why do you want to play a game like Demon's Souls?
9141317	9142638	Because that game is too fucking hard.
9142678	9143760	Are you a masochist, sir?
9144380	9147924	No, because you have to struggle to truly achieve anything.
9148224	9151628	And most of the games nowadays just hand you the ending on a silver platter.
9152629	9153269	Oh, snap.
9153730	9156531	All you have to do is, oh, I played it for 50 hours.
9156591	9157792	I'm almost near the end now.
9157832	9159032	There's no challenge in it.
9159512	9161954	You don't have to get better at the game to see the ending.
9162114	9164035	Sir, I think that might have been a dig at Final Fantasy.
9164075	9164755	I'm not quite sure.
9165555	9167516	No, this is gaming in general, man.
9167536	9169497	I'm covering the whole scope.
9169777	9170318	That's true.
9170438	9170898	That's true.
9171619	9175362	What do you hope they improve on in the next incarnation of the Souls series?
9175382	9175442	Hmm.
9200344	9211373	The only thing they could really improve on is maybe if they could get the whole environment into one gigantic streaming level, like just a big-ass castle.
9212274	9217858	So that way, although you can teleport to different areas of the castle, you can actually walk the whole thing from one thing to the other.
9217878	9219039	That would actually be kind of cool.
9220640	9221061	Oh, God.
9221641	9227186	You calling and asking about that game makes me really want to go back and play it, because I'll tell you, I didn't get very far, even though I spent hours...
9229884	9231484	Yeah, you got to talk to Pandit.
9231504	9236566	Out of everybody in the all-games community, I can think of, she's probably the one person I know of that's actually finished it.
9236966	9238286	Wow, finished?
9238986	9243968	Yeah, she's got a character that's like level 120 or something, so you know you have to put some time in to get a character that high.
9244008	9246308	Yeah, that's dedication.
9246848	9248849	Well, anything else on your mind this week?
9250361	9255464	No, just that and the whole thing about the incremental updating for the sports games.
9255504	9259826	I mean, if it was on a PC, you'd just get patches now and again for all that information.
9260786	9265028	Granted, the fans who want to pay it just so they can have the updated team rosters, that's fine.
9265249	9267590	But they'd just be just as happy if they got it in a patch.
9267950	9269631	Isn't a lot of that crap also DLC?
9271345	9299353	it could be DLC too like for instance yeah an updated Rouser cost you three bucks or whatever they wouldn't have to release a whole new game it would be nothing but profit they wouldn't have to reprint or anything else like that you know now that the DLC has been pushed out there I could see them easily doing that but I don't think they want to like most of the executives will do don't mess with the money you know so keep it coming the way they're used to paying for it and maybe we can keep that money coming in the way we want it alright so I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls but thanks for your call
9299963	9300563	No problem, guys.
9300584	9301164	You can take it easy.
9322310	9324313	This is Zeether from the chat.
9324513	9325515	Zeether!
9326276	9328799	I recognize your name, but I think you're also a first-time caller, right?
9328819	9329961	Yeah, I'm a first-time caller.
9330261	9331603	Long-time listener, first-time caller?
9332905	9333185	Yeah.
9333606	9333886	Awesome.
9334147	9334868	What's on your mind, Zeether?
9335498	9340060	Oh, I was just, you guys were talking about Wonga on Maximum Tune.
9340200	9340420	Yes.
9340720	9352505	And that was really, I was really hyped for that because I've been following it ever since it was announced and they had the trailer put out and the music already sounds really good.
9352925	9359708	I mean, the trailer just has like a little mix of the various songs, but it sounds fantastic.
9359768	9362089	I really hope they release like a soundtrack CD for it.
9362449	9363590	Oh, like they did the other games.
9363630	9364952	Yeah, those soundtracks are awesome.
9364972	9367014	Have you ever actually driven to those soundtracks?
9368775	9369616	Yeah, actually I did.
9369636	9372379	I used to drive from high school and back while listening to it.
9372679	9373860	And how fast did you go?
9375742	9377244	Didn't make me drive faster though.
9377264	9377764	Oh, okay.
9378265	9381608	Because I'll tell you, some of that music makes me just want to drive faster.
9381949	9383570	I will say nothing about the LA trips.
9383750	9383930	Yes.
9386949	9393615	Yeah, and, oh yeah, have any of you guys played the PS2 game, the Wangan PS2 game?
9394136	9396798	It was like Tokyo Extreme Racer, kind of.
9397399	9398039	I have not.
9398079	9404926	There was one on PlayStation 3 that Loki imported, but it was not like the arcade games at all.
9404966	9406347	It was kind of bad, actually.
9406407	9407128	What was the one?
9407488	9408329	Wangan Midnight.
9408829	9427237	just Wangan Midnight was the one there actually was one on the PS2 and it was released in the arcades as Wangan Midnight R and it was basically like a Tokyo Extreme Racer type game and the music in it was different from like the standard trance music it was more orchestral
9428902	9429182	Yuzo Koshiro
9453840	9454421	Thanks for watching!
9472661	9477925	Last time I played Streets of Rage was on the Sonic's Mega Genesis Collection or whatever for the Xbox 360.
9478865	9480126	No, I have the PS3 one actually.
9480386	9482288	And it's got like Streets of Rage 1, 2, and 3.
9482748	9483488	So it's a great deal.
9484869	9486871	Along with a shit ton of other Genesis games.
9486931	9487351	It's great.
9488552	9488872	Yeah.
9489392	9489653	All right.
9489673	9492154	Well, any other games we should be looking out for this week?
9493535	9494376	No, nothing else.
9494536	9498419	I was just calling about Wongun because I'm a pretty big fan of that.
9498499	9499739	And Initial D. Initial D.
9500760	9501160	Love it.
9501881	9507925	Hey, those are the games that are kind of keeping some arcades afloat right now with actual arcades as opposed to kiddie gambling.
9508246	9514170	Like, you go to the local Golf Land here, those are really the only games that made me stop and go, ooh, I kind of want to actually spend money on this game.
9514590	9518633	Because there's so much crap now, you know, that spit out tickets and so forth.
9519571	9531754	The sad thing is the newer initial D games, like versions 5 and 6, they have not gotten proper English versions because Sega probably just gave up on localizing them.
9531774	9532595	That's sad.
9533755	9541797	Well, the good news is the PlayStation 3 is region-free, so hopefully this new game that they're releasing in the arcades, maybe we'll get a decent home version of it.
9542477	9544558	Even if it's only in Japan, at least we can import it over here.
9545393	9548455	Yeah, I've been considering getting a PS3 because of the initial D game.
9548795	9551196	I've watched all of the anime, pretty much.
9551456	9552337	It's fantastic.
9552357	9555498	You are really into these games, then, if you've gone so far as to watch the anime.
9555518	9556099	That's pretty cool.
9556839	9557179	Yeah.
9557580	9560621	Alright, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much for your call, alright?
9561182	9561902	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
9563997	9570401	and here's a hint, don't go driving down a barren freeway to the soundtracks of one of those games because you might not realize how fast you were going.
9570821	9573702	DarkSakura, let me have you work on your story real quick here before I go back to the phone.
9573943	9581027	Okay, the story is actually that the creator of VVVVVV made a Super Meat Boy tribute, sort of.
9581727	9586370	He did a Super Meat Boy flash game that's in the style of his own game, VVVVVV.
9587430	9605396	So it's actually available at distractionware.com slash games slash flash slash meat boy And he says it's only a couple of screens long and very broken I can't wait for the next team meat game, just saying Let's go to the phones and take another call Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9606536	9609397	Hi, this is Spazinator Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind buddy?
9612123	9613344	A couple things, actually.
9614745	9621590	To touch on what we were talking about a few minutes ago with the whole EA constantly releasing new games.
9623532	9632478	Well, in fact, you had mentioned, I believe, why don't they just release yearly patches instead of releasing new games.
9634059	9639203	To use an analogy, I'll ask a rhetorical question.
9639696	9647403	How much did DarkSakura pay for the 4.2 patch in World of Warcraft?
9648443	9649044	Nothing, right?
9649424	9649965	Right, nothing.
9651246	9661675	Well, that kind of illustrates the point that you can't really charge for patches.
9662355	9663336	They can update the...
9665200	9693287	Madden 20 billion times you know with patches but you can't really make $60 off patches let me play devil's advocate here for a minute though you could say that she got the patches free but you could also say she's paying $14.95 a month to get the patch because you know MMOs are kind of their own little beast because you do pay a subscription fee for most of them now granted some are free to play but they just make their money in other ways
9694724	9695405	Yeah, true.
9696025	9700128	Perhaps I really picked a really poor example for my analogy.
9700148	9700708	That's all right.
9701889	9715318	But even if you had, let's say, Uncharted 1, the patch analogy would apply because there's no monthly charts for Uncharted.
9715518	9716298	Right.
9716419	9717319	But now...
9719281	9731907	If they were to release, you know, the yearly increments in Madden on desk, you know, with the, you know, then, yeah, they can make their 60 bucks every single time, you know.
9731967	9745654	It's kind of like, I don't know, why kill the goose that's laying the golden eggs, or at least gimp it anyway, when they can keep it nothing healthy and kill all the golden eggs, you know.
9746280	9748682	Well, it's kind of like making sequels to movies.
9749063	9752967	They don't release those for free, so I don't know.
9753807	9759473	Yeah, well, one final note before I do let you go.
9759693	9760554	Sure.
9761655	9766420	Just a quick update as to what's going on with my PlayStation 3 thing.
9766560	9768842	I know everyone's kind of asking about it, so...
9771098	9788789	Well, right now, Game Repair is temporarily on hold, if only because of bureaucratic red tape with my Social Security Disability Payee's offices.
9789790	9791211	I have put in a request.
9792011	9794712	for the extra funds for like two weeks ago.
9794892	9797874	So it's a money issue right now.
9797914	9801155	Just real life economical money stuff.
9802096	9802376	Yeah.
9803777	9807338	And basically, yeah, yeah, yeah.
9807598	9813061	Apparently I need to have her do some paperwork and I have to find data.
9813081	9815142	They got taken care of.
9817156	9820258	But to be fair, these are all things that have nothing to do with Sony.
9820318	9832462	Yeah, but to make a long story short, hopefully I'll have the money to have it repaired this week.
9833596	9836619	and once I get the money, I'll get the ball rolling and get everything repaired.
9837159	9840382	Alright, well you'll have to let us know how that repair process goes once you get that taken care of.
9840762	9844044	Alright, well Spassinator, we're going to let you go to get some more calls but thank you for your thoughts.
9844265	9847187	Have a good one and good luck with the PlayStation drama.
9847327	9849048	Bye.
9849068	9853472	1877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call and we'll talk.
9854533	9857195	Meanwhile, does anyone else have other stories they want to talk about tonight?
9857939	9865966	I do want to say that I've put some more stuff up on our Tumblr, including Gon's ending in Tekken 3 and some of the playthrough of Tekken Force Mode.
9866186	9871131	You should also do me a favor and put up the recorder video that we had talked about earlier in the show.
9871211	9872352	I will do such a thing.
9872432	9872752	Thank you.
9872772	9873993	That would be nice.
9874533	9877896	Meanwhile, I guess we have time for one more call, so let's go back to the... Whoa!
9877956	9878737	There is feedback.
9878917	9879718	Hi, caller, can you hear me?
9881465	9882505	Okay, gotta let you go, buddy.
9882725	9883225	I am sorry.
9883285	9884306	Can you check your connection?
9884426	9886666	Echo 123, remember, is a good thing to call?
9887166	9888867	Sorry, I apologize to the listeners.
9888887	9889747	That was driving me bonkers.
9890287	9891467	A little bit out of my control, though.
9891487	9893228	All right, let's try another call.
9893268	9894128	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9894148	9894468	Who's this?
9895768	9896328	Hey, what's up, guys?
9896348	9897009	This is Kai Judo.
9897149	9897709	Hey, Kai Judo.
9897729	9898369	What's on your mind, buddy?
9899729	9907111	I just wanted to make two points as far as the sports games just being an update roster type of thing.
9907191	9907351	Yeah.
9908619	9910019	I'm not the biggest sports game player.
9910039	9915720	I mean, every once in a while I'll pick up the NBA 2K series just because I like that series.
9915780	9924202	But what I do notice when I do pick it up, maybe it's just because I wait a couple of years before I pick it up, they do add a lot more to the game, especially on the multiplayer side.
9924702	9934784	Like right now in the NBA games, you can actually play like you and four other people can actually play five other people in line.
9934804	9937124	Like you'll be like one entire basketball team.
9937779	9940402	and you could go up against another team of five, which I think is great.
9940422	9945948	I wish they would put that in a baseball game, actually have nine versus nine in a baseball game.
9946709	9947970	I don't know why they haven't done that yet.
9947990	9948871	I'm pretty sure they can do it.
9949435	9974384	but um you know they they they're pretty innovative is basically what I'm saying is that they they do add stuff other than just updating the roster you know what's interesting though is I do notice a common theme between what you're saying between what Matt's saying and between what I think I'm going to say for us and our support of DDR over the years even when a lot of people didn't get it and that is you know in chat SJ100 Matt said you know I pay 60 bucks a year gladly because I love hockey and this is
9974844	9976444	How I Get Close to Hockey.
9976924	9980105	And for you, it just sounds like it's replaced basketball with hockey.
9980545	9985426	And for you, even though the rest of us might look at it and go, they don't even update anything in those games.
9985506	9989687	You look at it and go, oh my God, there's all these awesome new features that make it more realistic.
9990327	9991167	Am I kind of right here?
9991327	9995088	That maybe not everyone gets it because not everyone is necessarily a huge fan.
9995408	10002330	Whereas we look at DDR and we go, oh, but they've introduced, now you can do Marvelous as opposed to Perfects as well and it's a new thing.
10002410	10003910	And not everybody gets that.
10004778	10005458	Yeah, yeah.
10005578	10006419	It just has to be your thing.
10006439	10013322	You just have to be into it to really notice some of the subtle differences and the major differences that they do make in a game.
10013342	10015363	So they do improve the game a lot.
10015723	10019725	So yeah, the updated roster thing is kind of like a crazy argument.
10019745	10023506	And the other thing I wanted to point out was sports games do actually have a story.
10023806	10030889	I mean, you have to create the story on your own, just basically using your own imagination, kind of like an old D&D tabletop type of a game.
10031590	10032810	But there is story.
10032830	10034231	I mean, especially I can remember...
10035098	10039099	I was playing Madden back in the early 90s when I was in my teens.
10039420	10041780	Me and my friends had stories.
10041820	10042761	We had rivalries going.
10042801	10045141	We had tournaments going.
10045241	10052824	We were playing with a lot of emotion behind those games because so-and-so beat my ass last week, so now I've got to come back and beat their ass.
10053524	10055405	and, you know, it's just a lot of fun to play.
10055665	10056705	You don't want to fucking lose.
10056725	10059086	Yeah, exactly, yeah.
10059686	10059966	All right.
10059986	10061347	Yeah, those are my two points.
10061727	10062047	Awesome.
10062087	10062407	Well, good.
10062567	10063388	I think those are fair points.
10063408	10064048	I'm weighing on my prize.
10065308	10066449	Yes, you know what happened?
10066509	10067849	We got a little slowed down.
10067949	10075412	I have it sitting here and Loki has to sign it because we got folks, he ran out last week before I had a chance to have him sign it, but we're hoping to get that out to you Monday or Tuesday.
10075752	10077152	So, look out for it.
10077172	10077413	No problem.
10077433	10077833	Take your time.
10078033	10078693	All right.
10078953	10079493	All right, thank you.
10079513	10080114	All right, good night.
10080134	10080494	Take care, buddy.
10081694	10082195	Alright, bye
10111385	10112371	and see what we end up with.
10112531	10113718	Oh my god, I hear it again.
10113758	10114441	Caller, are you there?
10118846	10119646	Okay, I can't.
10120066	10120366	I can't.
10120466	10121987	It sounds like the emergency broadcast system.
10122367	10122987	I'm so sorry.
10123347	10124368	But I just, I can't.
10124968	10125308	All right.
10126228	10127588	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10127728	10136431	If you want to send in your thoughts, send us an email at mailbag at orangelaundry.com or you can, of course, always leave us a voicemail or what have you.
10136451	10137911	We try to get to those throughout the week as well.
10138291	10141252	Or send us a tweet, twitter.com slash OLR.
10141972	10142232	All right.
10142312	10145873	In the meantime, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap things up tonight.
10145933	10148094	So, Loki, what's your final thought?
10148547	10151533	My final thought is... I'm tired.
10154658	10156983	Alright, and DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
10157664	10158546	Gon is pretty funny.
10159910	10164792	and my final thought tonight is even though I had a quesadilla today, now I want a taco.
10164912	10166252	I want the complete Mexican food day.
10166753	10167313	That's what I want.
10168353	10168893	Jimmy Chunga.
10170214	10172435	All right, that's going to do it for another week here of Orange Launch Radio.
