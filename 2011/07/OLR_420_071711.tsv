7000	13000	There's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki
14000	19000	Tonight, July 17th, 2011, another company is set to charge for online passes.
19000	24000	Could an old MMO be coming to the PS Vita and PopCap Games finds a buyer?
24000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	42000	Orange Lounge Radio. It is July 17th, episode 420 of our show.
42000	46000	I'll just kind of leave that over there and let the jokes write themselves.
46000	50000	We are here to talk about video games on the show where every gamer has a voice.
50000	60000	You can join us live every week, Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern and All Games Radio right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at www.allgames.com
60000	66000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you with my co-hosts. First off, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
66000	71000	Hey, how's it going, Jamie?
71000	72000	I don't know, I'm allergic.
72000	73000	So wasted.
74000	79000	No, I'm not. I'm high on coffee right now that Dark Sakura brewed for me before the show.
79000	81000	It's like a special blend. I like this.
81000	88000	I make excellent coffee. I will tell everybody, it's half hazelnut, half chocolate macadamia, which is decaf.
88000	89000	And then marijuana.
89000	95000	No. A teaspoon of Hershey's cocoa and a little bit of cinnamon.
95000	97000	Is coffee going to make me fat?
97000	102000	No. Because, keep in mind, cocoa does not really have any sugar in it.
104000	105000	Okay, alright.
105000	108000	This is regular cocoa, like the can of cocoa.
108000	113000	Is this an episode of Orange Lawn Trader or am I watching like Cooking with Paula Deen? Because you are from the South, after all.
113000	114000	Ew.
114000	117000	That woman is frightening. This woman.
117000	118000	What's your problem with Paula Deen?
118000	120000	They photoshopped her anyway.
120000	122000	They just, she just likes butter.
122000	126000	No, okay. Have you, look at every magazine cover and advertisement that she's on.
126000	133000	It's always this one same smile. It's like they take different pictures of her and just plaster the same face on her in Photoshop.
133000	138000	Well, I was looking through my Facebook pictures not that long ago and I had kind of a similar smile in a lot of my pictures.
138000	140000	Like I tend to do that whole like, what?
140000	141000	But you're not photoshopped.
141000	142000	You're right, I'm not photoshopped.
142000	143000	To look like that.
143000	144000	Alright.
144000	145000	It looks.
145000	146000	I'm naturally that beautiful.
146000	147000	She looks like a wax sculpture.
147000	151000	She looks like she belongs in Madame Trousseau's House of Wax or whatever.
151000	152000	Yeah.
152000	154000	But her sculpture would be made out of butter.
154000	156000	Maybe butter is a good preservative.
156000	160000	I don't know. Alright, look. We gotta also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
160000	161000	Hi.
161000	163000	And I know Loki knows a thing or two about cooking with butter.
163000	166000	Yes, it's the best way to go.
166000	169000	Exactly. So how are you, Loki?
169000	170000	I'm fine.
170000	172000	What's your dinner of choice tonight? The listeners are dying to know.
172000	173000	It's pepperoni pizza.
173000	175000	Pepperoni pizza. Good times.
175000	176000	I ate some.
176000	186000	It was good. I was just craving pizza the other day because, well, we were talking about pizza and I was like, hmm, I want pizza.
186000	193000	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com, you guys can always join us and have your say in what's going on on this program.
193000	195000	Starting off with Break Man tonight.
195000	199000	Obviously, the chatters are making their own little jokes about this being episode 420.
199000	203000	And Break Man says, most podcasts don't last this many episodes.
203000	206000	You know, not to sound cocky, but you're right. A lot don't.
206000	215000	I mean, granted, this show's been around since before podcasting was, so I think that's kind of how we were able to get the jump on that because we were a live3cc5.com show for a little while.
215000	217000	Starting in 2002.
217000	222000	But there are some daily shows. The shows that go daily have the chance to get there.
222000	225000	I mean, you can get a daily show up to 420 episodes in a couple years.
225000	228000	So, you know, there's definitely some that have made it there.
228000	233000	And, hey, any show that can get past, like, 50 is a great accomplishment, if you ask me.
233000	237000	It takes dedication to get that far daily, weekly, no matter what you are.
237000	239000	So, yeah, but we're happy to be here.
239000	245000	And thank you guys for joining us in chat every week, as you always do, whether you're high or not, to be listening to this program.
245000	248000	Thank you guys for always supporting us.
248000	250000	It's a wonderful, wonderful feeling.
250000	257000	I'm still having some warm fuzzies coming off of Under Sedation Live, which is another program here at All Games Radio on Saturday nights.
257000	261000	I was a guest on their 10th anniversary special, which aired last night.
261000	265000	And for those that don't know, that was a show I was on before Orange Lounge Radio.
265000	270000	Dark Sakura was a guest many, many times. You can go back and check out the archives of that show over at their website.
270000	274000	And, yeah, it was a lot of fun to just, you know, sit in on that just like good times.
274000	279000	And some folks that were listening to it said, you don't really sound like the same guy on that program.
279000	281000	Well, you know, it's a different show.
281000	286000	I'm very laid back on Under Sedation Live because I'm not in the driver's seat, so to speak.
286000	288000	I can just sit there and be a jackass.
288000	291000	Kind of what Loki does on this program. I'm just kidding.
291000	292000	No, that's correct.
292000	296000	Alright. Anyhow, let's move on.
296000	299000	Enough about talking about podcasts and podcasting.
299000	303000	Let's talk about video games and the types of games you've been playing this week.
303000	305000	How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
305000	309000	I played well, but really only to do my dailies.
309000	314000	Two more days and I'll be in another 150 Marks of the Damn World tree.
314000	318000	This is the whole new Fire Land patch they put in that gave some good single player content.
318000	321000	One item level away from being able to do Fire Lands.
321000	327000	So, hopefully I can get one more good purple item and I'll be there.
327000	332000	I also played a lot of Peggle on my iPhone.
332000	339000	Just out of pure boredom in that and every so often when I need something brainless to do, I play Peggle.
339000	342000	I also... God, what was it? I was playing on Steam.
342000	344000	I was playing actually some more Droplets.
344000	348000	Because it's, again, another thing that I can kind of not really think about while I play.
348000	351000	And I'm not really all that great at it anyway, but it's kind of fun.
351000	354000	And then I played...
354000	357000	Crap, what else was it that I was playing?
357000	361000	Oh yeah, we had some Initial D going on because we have Extreme Stage.
361000	364000	And, which is funny to watch Dan play.
364000	365000	What's the deal with Extreme Stage?
365000	366000	It's the new PS3 one.
366000	370000	The thing about those Japanese racing games is that there's always some little subtitle to it.
370000	372000	And I'm like, well, what's new about this one?
372000	375000	It's just another racing game with techno music.
375000	382000	We have the second stage game that was on PlayStation 2.
382000	384000	And we have this one for PS3.
384000	386000	And the PS2 one is better.
386000	388000	It has a lot more music.
388000	392000	I mean, this one's got, I think, some harder tracks in it and it's prettier.
392000	397000	But I honestly think, play-wise, that second stage was better.
397000	405000	But Dan managed to get it really cheap from one of the PlayStation, the best, greatest hits, whatever.
405000	409000	So are those Initial D games on PS3 kind of faithful to the arcade?
409000	411000	Yeah, it's exactly like the one we have at Golf Land.
411000	413000	Do you have to know a lot of Japanese to play those games?
413000	414000	Yes.
414000	415000	Damn.
415000	416000	However...
416000	417000	Because I'm not very good.
417000	419000	Are there translations on game FAQs?
419000	420000	Yes.
420000	423000	Dan has an FAQ and he even has the whole story mode translated and everything.
423000	424000	Oh nice, okay.
424000	426000	But when he got it, he didn't have any of that.
426000	429000	And thankfully, I could read just enough of it.
429000	430000	Right.
430000	433000	That I could say, okay, this one means you want to replay.
433000	436000	Yeah, but you had a couple years of Japanese in college, right?
436000	437000	Yeah.
437000	438000	I had just enough.
438000	443000	Like, I read a retarded five-year-old in Japanese.
443000	448000	So I had just enough in me that I could say, okay, that's what that says, that's what that says.
448000	453000	And then we sort of figured out, because I could read half of some of the kanji in the tracks.
453000	458000	So I was like, okay, that one's Irohazaka, that one's, you know, Akina, that one, so...
458000	461000	I gotta say this in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com.
461000	465000	We've got Dark Tetsuya's in there saying, Rob, you mean Eurobeat?
465000	466000	Because I called it techno.
466000	471000	And yeah, the thing about Initial D especially is it has a very unique style of music that plays in the background.
471000	474000	If you've never heard Initial D music before, it sounds something like this.
478000	479000	You know there is such a thing as that.
479000	481000	Doesn't that make you want to run over people?
481000	485000	You've been in the car with me, driving to LA, listening to...
485000	488000	While you're going 105 miles an hour and it's frightening.
488000	490000	In my Lancer. In my old Lancer.
490000	493000	Well, now we had Dan driving and guess what he wanted to listen to?
493000	495000	Eurobeat.
495000	497000	There is something about Eurobeat that makes you go faster.
497000	501000	But, you know, they also, you can do Para Para to stuff other than Eurobeat.
501000	502000	There's Tech Para.
502000	503000	Really?
503000	504000	Yeah.
504000	510000	But actually the whole Eurobeat thing is really, I think, making a huge, huge comeback too.
510000	511000	I want to see emo Para.
511000	512000	Emo Para?
512000	514000	That's goth dancing.
514000	516000	Exactly, but Para.
516000	522000	Now see, I'm a little partial to the music in Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune.
522000	523000	Oh hell yeah.
523000	524000	Because it's not really Eurobeat.
524000	528000	It's more like just, I don't know, techno...
528000	529000	It's racing music.
529000	531000	It just makes me want to drive fast.
531000	532000	Listen to this.
534000	535000	Trance?
535000	537000	You know what my song in that game is?
537000	538000	Yeah, kind of Trance.
538000	541000	Was it Destination Blackout?
541000	543000	Or that's another Para Para song.
543000	544000	I don't know.
544000	546000	Then of course there's F-Zero music.
546000	547000	Oh god.
547000	548000	Yeah.
548000	549000	God, I miss F-Zero so much.
549000	551000	Nintendo, why do you hate me?
551000	555000	Well, I have just loaded you up with old school Bimani Rob.
555000	556000	Sweet.
556000	559000	Including some Para Para.
559000	560000	And Papa Music.
560000	561000	I'll be skipping that folder.
561000	564000	No, I've put in like a few songs, but I'll also give you some Papa Music stuff.
564000	567000	So you can get your Dez Row on.
567000	569000	I never got into the Papa Music soundtracks.
569000	572000	It's fun to drive to Dez Row.
572000	573000	I'll take your word for it.
573000	575000	Alright, any other games you've been playing this week?
575000	577000	I've been playing...
577000	580000	Apparently I've been playing Kick Dan and Asleep.
580000	582000	How do you earn points in that game?
582000	585000	Whoever wakes up with the most bruises, I don't know.
585000	587000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
587000	588000	Oh, and I swam.
588000	589000	I went outside.
589000	592000	That's not a game, Loki.
592000	593000	Yeah, especially going outside.
593000	595000	That's definitely not a game.
595000	598000	I played just basically two things.
598000	600000	Grand Theft Auto.
600000	601000	You know, typical stuff.
601000	604000	Still playing through ranked deathmatches.
604000	606000	And the Balagate Tony.
606000	608000	And kind of getting back in the groove of that.
608000	610000	And that didn't take me long.
610000	614000	And I've already got all my coworkers very frustrated at me.
614000	619000	And then I of course played a little bit of Earth Defense Horse Insect Armageddon.
619000	621000	Because it's just awesome.
621000	624000	Still kind of grinding my way through that.
624000	626000	How long is that game?
626000	629000	Can you beat it in a few hours?
629000	631000	It's not very long.
631000	633000	It's a lot less missions than the first game.
633000	638000	The first game had these really stupid missions that kind of repeated themselves almost.
638000	639000	They had like 70 missions.
639000	641000	This one has 15.
641000	644000	But each mission is much longer.
644000	648000	I don't remember how long it took me to beat it, but it wasn't that long.
648000	652000	You could probably beat it in 10 hours.
652000	655000	Actually not even 10 hours. Probably a lot less than that.
655000	656000	Alright.
656000	658000	Holy crap. Guess what folder I just found.
658000	659000	Oh god.
659000	660000	All of Loki's old mixes.
660000	662000	Oh, all the remixes he used to do.
662000	664000	He hasn't made a mix in years.
664000	666000	Anyway, we don't want to deviate too much from games right now.
666000	667000	Sorry.
667000	669000	No, that's alright.
669000	671000	And then, yeah.
671000	675000	So that's basically, I was just playing those.
675000	676000	Sweet.
676000	677000	My gaming week.
677000	679000	Let's see, games I've been playing this week.
679000	681000	I'm still playing Final Fantasy 13, making my way through that.
681000	685000	I finally beat Chapter 11, which I find is the point where most people say,
685000	686000	This game is awesome.
686000	689000	Or a lot of my friends kind of got to Chapter 11 and they're like,
689000	693000	This game opened up way too much and now some of the monsters can actually kill me.
693000	694000	I quit.
694000	697000	But I found Chapter 11 to be great.
697000	702000	And the trick is, folks, if you're stuck on Chapter 11, don't feel like it's like the rest of the game
702000	705000	where you have to fight every monster you come in contact with.
705000	709000	In fact, many are better left avoided until you way level up your characters.
709000	715000	A lot of those Seath side quests that you can do, you really shouldn't do until towards the end of the game.
715000	718000	It's kind of comparable to Emerald Weapon from Final Fantasy 7.
718000	721000	You really weren't supposed to do that until after the end.
721000	724000	So there's, you know, you don't have to feel like you do everything right away.
724000	726000	You can do that after the end too.
726000	727000	Yeah, yeah.
727000	729000	Now I'm 13 from what I understand is the same way even though I haven't beat it yet.
729000	733000	So I did finally play through, after doing about 15 of those side quests,
733000	738000	I did, actually it was more like, God, after climbing the tower, it was probably more like 30 of those side quests.
738000	742000	I finally climbed the tower, got to the end of Chapter 11 and started Chapter 12
742000	747000	and I've got to say, oh my God, that was a badass cinematic that kicked off Chapter 12.
747000	751000	I don't want to spoil too much of the story, but you'll figure out pretty quickly who the Eidolons are.
751000	753000	They're like the Summons.
753000	759000	They are all involved in the opening, like imagine Summons mixed with the scene out of Tron Legacy.
759000	764000	That was the opening to Chapter 12 and like it was so hot, like I just, I had to fan myself after it was over.
764000	767000	I think I've been, I've gotten to that point, but I don't remember.
767000	770000	It was, it's really far in, you would remember.
770000	772000	It was, it was an amazing cutscene.
772000	774000	So yeah, now I'm at that point and trying to...
774000	776000	Is that before the game? Okay, that's after...
776000	778000	That's way after it opens up.
778000	784000	You have to really, Chapter 11 will take you like as long as like five chapters did from the...
784000	790000	Yeah, maybe, because I was wasting my time just doing all the side quests because I can.
790000	794000	So, yeah, so that was, that was, you know, Final Fantasy 13.
794000	796000	I probably poured like 40 hours into that now.
796000	799000	Talking about that game, even though it's like a year and a half old for like the past four weeks.
799000	804000	But, understand, I, you know, can only put so many hours in in a week and I just recently picked it back up again.
804000	807000	But I'm hoping in the next couple weeks I'll have it beat.
807000	810000	Other video games I've been playing, on Steam I played Beat Hazard.
810000	812000	Which I, for some reason, just can't get enough of that game.
812000	815000	Like, it's great. Like, it's a cool little...
815000	820000	I talked about it last week on the show, but again, it's, you can use your own music and it's Geometry Wars-esque.
820000	824000	But it's a great little, like, kind of like how Dark Sakura was talking about Peggle.
824000	829000	It's a great little game that you can play in three or five minute doses because that's how long the music in your library is.
829000	833000	And it's kind of fun to play to a new song going, I wonder how this song is going to play.
833000	840000	And again, I love how you can buy these perks as you level up that make you want to go back and play the old songs again.
840000	844000	Because you can get a higher score and work towards a cumulative leaderboard.
844000	848000	Lots of great stuff in that game. I'm, I'm liking Beat Hazard quite a bit.
848000	852000	And then, let's see, other Steam games I've been playing, not a whole lot.
852000	856000	I never did get around to Terraria. I've got to play that in the next week, the one that Dark Sakura was talking about last week.
856000	858000	I have a copy. Haven't played it yet.
858000	862000	I was playing on the 360, a couple new games that I picked up.
862000	865000	Best Buy was having a buy one, get one sale on Kinect games.
865000	869000	So I got a late birthday present from Salacious Pop of Child of Eden.
869000	871000	Finally got to play that game.
871000	876000	And Your Self Fitness, I think, is that the Ubisoft Fitness game?
876000	878000	Your Self Fitness? That's what it's called, right?
878000	882000	The most well received of the Kinect fitness games is the one we got.
882000	886000	Starting with Child of Eden, I played it for a little bit with Kinect.
886000	889000	And it was a very interesting experience.
889000	894000	I thought the Kinect sensitivity was good. It felt really good, like, as I was playing it.
894000	900000	But the one thing I didn't like was how you get a multiplier by firing on the beat of the music.
900000	902000	That's part of how, like, the music comes into play.
902000	905000	If you fire on the beat of the music, you kind of increase your multiplier.
905000	909000	Well, the way you fire in that mode is you kind of have to push your hand forward,
909000	911000	or you have to kind of, I guess, flick your hand.
911000	913000	Like, that's how it reads a firing.
913000	916000	And I don't find that to be very precise.
916000	918000	And when you're talking about music games, I really need precision.
918000	920000	And that was really weird to me.
920000	923000	And I found myself really just flinging my hand forward,
923000	925000	which really caused my hand to hurt after a little bit.
925000	930000	So that could be my own bad, but the game also didn't explain it to me very well,
930000	933000	how I could really make sure I register that on the beat.
933000	935000	Now, the good thing is you can play with Kinect or controller.
935000	938000	So after, like, playing it, you know, a little bit with Kinect,
938000	941000	I switched to the controller and played through a couple stages.
941000	944000	And I like the controller responsiveness quite a bit more.
944000	948000	And the game itself, it's basically Rez, but I'm going to admit,
948000	950000	I didn't like the music quite as much.
950000	953000	I like that there's more elements to the game,
953000	956000	and I think the game is very great-looking graphically.
956000	959000	Like, when I talk about more elements, I like that there's, like, a second gun
959000	962000	that you use to use, like, one gun to shoot down bullets.
962000	964000	Like, a rapid-fire machine gun type thing.
964000	967000	And then you use another to lock onto targets, just like you did in Rez.
967000	974000	So it's a neat little interface, and it's a step up from Rez,
974000	978000	but unfortunately the music wasn't a step up from Rez for me.
978000	980000	And maybe that's just personal preference,
980000	983000	but when the music is the core thing in the game,
983000	985000	I have to admit that was a little bit disappointing.
985000	987000	But granted, I've only played a couple stages,
987000	990000	so I will beat the game and let you know if I ever find that stage
990000	994000	that has a song where I'm like, OMG, I loved it.
994000	997000	Yeah, otherwise, I think as a Kinect game, it's certainly a lot of fun,
997000	999000	and I think as one I would show people.
999000	1004000	But yeah, that sensitivity, music, firing mechanism thing,
1004000	1009000	I would love if there was, like, a clicker or something I could hold in my hand
1009000	1014000	while I'm doing it to allow something tangible that's more precise.
1014000	1016000	But I don't really know how you would do that,
1016000	1018000	and it kind of takes away from what the Kinect is all about.
1018000	1021000	But like, you know how when you're using the Wiimote,
1021000	1023000	you at least still have a button in your hand?
1023000	1026000	Like, I hate to say it, but I almost think this game might be a little better
1026000	1028000	with the Wii controls.
1028000	1030000	Yikes. I don't know.
1030000	1032000	So that was just my thoughts on it.
1032000	1034000	So then you would probably want to play the PlayStation 3 version
1034000	1037000	with the Move controls.
1037000	1041000	Yeah, actually. I think the Move might actually be better for this.
1041000	1047000	But again, I am very much about I need the precision with the music game,
1047000	1050000	and I don't feel like moving my hand forward or flicking my hand,
1050000	1053000	especially when the Kinect is not a perfect system.
1053000	1055000	If you're not playing it in the perfect environment,
1055000	1057000	it doesn't recognize you always.
1057000	1059000	And that was some of the problems I had with the other game I played,
1059000	1061000	your self-fitness.
1061000	1064000	But it may work better, though, now with that new accessory that's coming out,
1064000	1068000	the Kinect Zoom thing from Nyko.
1068000	1069000	That might be a little bit better.
1069000	1071000	That might be better.
1071000	1073000	Again, at least the Kinect is better than the iToy was.
1073000	1077000	The iToy, my God, that technology never worked right.
1077000	1082000	But I feel Kinect is still a step above, but it's got a long way to go.
1082000	1084000	The technology isn't perfect.
1084000	1086000	But these games are still pretty early.
1086000	1089000	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchy.com, Zether says,
1089000	1091000	I heard The Child of Eden didn't sell good.
1091000	1094000	Yeah, apparently it only sold about 30-some-odd thousand copies,
1094000	1099000	which didn't really even put it in the top 20 of games that were sold last month.
1099000	1102000	I don't know, maybe Loki knows more about what sales ultimately mean and so forth.
1102000	1106000	But I honestly think what probably scared a lot of people off were these reviews talking about,
1106000	1109000	it's a 90-minute game, and you're paying $60 for it.
1109000	1113000	I'm hoping that this game will sell much more when it gets discounted,
1113000	1115000	because I think it's one of the better Kinect games.
1115000	1116000	It's just a niche game.
1116000	1118000	I mean, Rez and stuff, that was a niche game.
1118000	1123000	And unfortunately, it's a niche that we like, but it's a niche game.
1123000	1124000	And that's the problem.
1124000	1125000	I mean, it's just like Earth Defense Force.
1125000	1128000	Earth Defense Force didn't sell that great either.
1128000	1132000	But if The Child of Eden had Britney Spears music in it, it would have sold ten times as many copies, right?
1132000	1133000	It would have been stupid though.
1133000	1136000	Actually, no, I don't think it would have sold ten times as many copies.
1136000	1138000	I think still people wouldn't give it a chance.
1138000	1142000	And even less copies would have been sold, because people would have been like,
1142000	1144000	you know, like us, I'm not touching that shit.
1144000	1146000	What the hell is this?
1146000	1152000	But yeah, Earth Defense Force, it sold, I think they estimated like 95,
1152000	1158000	well, like 65,000 to like 90,000 copies worldwide, which is fine,
1158000	1162000	because the launch quantities of that were only about 200,000 per platform.
1162000	1165000	So they're not expecting to sell much.
1165000	1169000	They know, you know, going into it, what they're expecting to get out of it.
1169000	1175000	And a game like Child of Eden, I don't think, development-wise,
1175000	1183000	it didn't cost as much money to put it together as, say, like, you know, a Modern Warfare game or something like that,
1183000	1186000	where you have to sell a lot more to make up the money.
1186000	1190000	I mean, I don't think that they had really huge expectations for it.
1190000	1192000	Yeah, true, true. That's a good point.
1192000	1196000	So, I'll quickly talk about the fitness game I played.
1196000	1199000	Your Shape Fitness, your Cell Fitness, I don't know, one of those fitness games.
1199000	1201000	The one from Ubisoft.
1201000	1208000	I really liked the idea of the whole tailored custom-to-you individual workout thing.
1208000	1210000	I liked that.
1210000	1219000	But I didn't like how the Kinect, again, doesn't really recognize you 100% of what you're doing,
1219000	1223000	because this game grades you pretty rigidly on the exercises you're doing.
1223000	1227000	And, you know, if you're not like perfect within the box that it has,
1227000	1230000	and your arms go way too out, like you don't get credit for stuff,
1230000	1235000	and it can be very frustrating, especially when the exercises are kind of kicking your butt a little bit.
1235000	1237000	You know, it was having me do these squats.
1237000	1242000	And the other thing I'm going to actually say I thought was terrible about this,
1242000	1245000	I truly think it was a bad decision to do this in a fitness game,
1245000	1250000	is when it was doing the calibration stages and having me warm up,
1250000	1253000	it did not start with a stretch activity.
1253000	1257000	And I think that is a very poor thing to do in a fitness game.
1257000	1261000	Actually, you want to warm up before you stretch.
1261000	1262000	Really?
1262000	1263000	Yes. Actually, yes.
1263000	1266000	Because you have to warm up the muscles before you stretch,
1266000	1268000	or else you run a risk of pulling a muscle.
1268000	1270000	I think if you saw what this game was doing, though,
1270000	1272000	some of the high-intensity exercises it was doing,
1272000	1276000	it's one thing to put a little flash card up on the screen saying,
1276000	1278000	you should stretch before using this device.
1278000	1282000	I honestly think a smarter little thing would have said,
1282000	1287000	okay, let's do some swaying in place, a little jogging,
1287000	1289000	now we're going to stretch,
1289000	1291000	now we're going to have you do the intensive squats and so forth.
1291000	1293000	Do they have a stretching portion at all?
1293000	1295000	Not that I ran into, but keep in mind,
1295000	1299000	this game kind of kicked my butt before I got very far into it.
1299000	1301000	I'd like to see it.
1301000	1304000	I've been sore in my legs for four days since playing,
1304000	1307000	and it's because stupid me didn't stretch beforehand.
1307000	1310000	And I was a little bit upset that the game should have,
1310000	1313000	I mean, I should have known better, yes.
1313000	1315000	I'm not going to totally blame the game,
1315000	1319000	but I just think it was a bad idea to not encourage me more,
1319000	1321000	remind me, hey, stupid, before you can stretch.
1321000	1324000	Well, not everyone knows that you need to stretch beforehand.
1324000	1327000	And I didn't think it was going to throw me so far into it
1327000	1329000	with the calibration where I'm doing some squatting
1329000	1332000	and things that are going to hurt my legs before telling me,
1332000	1334000	hey, maybe we should do some yoga first.
1334000	1337000	Well, just like every fitness class that I've ever gone to,
1337000	1339000	you start off with a warm-up,
1339000	1341000	you do light stretching, then you do your exercise,
1341000	1344000	then you do full stretching when you're done.
1344000	1347000	Because by then, your muscles are already warmed up and limber,
1347000	1350000	and that's when you need to stretch so that you don't,
1350000	1352000	so that when your muscles cool down,
1352000	1355000	they've stretched out and they won't cramp.
1355000	1357000	And again, I want to clarify before,
1357000	1359000	because this might show up later in the game,
1359000	1361000	so I want to be very careful in what I'm saying.
1361000	1364000	I was going through an initial setup calibration mode,
1364000	1366000	but it was having you do exercises as part of the calibration,
1366000	1368000	like a full routine type of thing,
1368000	1370000	and it did not have me stretch beforehand,
1370000	1372000	nor did no reminder come up at any point.
1372000	1374000	And maybe after the calibration,
1374000	1377000	when you get into the actual daily stuff,
1377000	1379000	you'll see more of that, but I'm not going to,
1379000	1382000	if I didn't see it beforehand, I'm a little worried.
1382000	1385000	So I have to razz the game on that,
1385000	1387000	and if you are going to play one of these games,
1387000	1390000	make sure you stretch at some point.
1390000	1392000	I guess if dark soccer brings up a point,
1392000	1396000	do a few runs, do a few dance moves or whatever,
1396000	1399000	then stretch, then play.
1399000	1401000	Because it makes all the difference with how well
1401000	1403000	you can keep up with the exercises too,
1403000	1407000	if you've given your chance to warm up and then stretch.
1407000	1409000	I like this comment from Kaijuto in our chat room,
1409000	1411000	chat.orangelandsready.com.
1411000	1415000	You do the stretch when you try to get the game out of the shrink wrap.
1415000	1418000	That's true. Some of those shrink wraps are pretty terrible,
1418000	1421000	but my arms don't hurt. It's my legs.
1421000	1423000	I'm telling you guys for real.
1423000	1426000	And it's sad, okay, I'm a teacher, right?
1426000	1428000	Not a kid teacher, but an adult teacher.
1428000	1429000	I teach in a corporate environment.
1429000	1432000	But I use classrooms full of computers,
1432000	1435000	and I walk around and look at adults on their systems all day long,
1435000	1437000	making sure they're following with me and so forth.
1437000	1439000	So I have to walk around the room.
1439000	1441000	The day after I did this Connect exercise,
1441000	1443000	I couldn't walk as much.
1443000	1445000	And I'm having to explain to my class,
1445000	1447000	yeah, sorry guys, I was playing Connect yesterday,
1447000	1449000	and those things are pretty rough.
1449000	1453000	How embarrassing is that?
1453000	1455000	Fool, you should have known to stretch.
1455000	1458000	You know, it used to happen to me when I would go play DDR on my lunch break.
1458000	1461000	And I'd come back, my knees hurt.
1461000	1464000	And like I had to, walking upstairs was not a problem.
1464000	1466000	Walking downstairs, oh my gosh,
1466000	1471000	I felt like a little old lady clutching to that railing.
1471000	1473000	I should have used the elevator.
1473000	1475000	It's like you're doing squats all over again.
1475000	1477000	It's easier to lift it than to drop to it.
1477000	1479000	It's traumatic.
1479000	1481000	But I'm not going to give up,
1481000	1484000	and I'm not going to say a lot of negative things about the game
1484000	1486000	because of that one thing.
1486000	1488000	You know, I'll know next time to stretch,
1488000	1492000	but I really think the game should have incorporated it better.
1492000	1495000	If I missed it, and I consider myself a pretty smart individual,
1495000	1499000	if I missed it, who knows who else is missing this and hurting themselves.
1499000	1501000	Hmm.
1501000	1502000	Thought?
1502000	1503000	No, not about that.
1503000	1504000	Oh, okay.
1504000	1506000	It's actually something that came up in my video game week
1506000	1508000	that I didn't get to play because of a certain something.
1508000	1509000	Uh, sure.
1509000	1511000	Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. It just occurred to me.
1511000	1513000	That's okay. That was the last game I wanted to talk about anyway.
1513000	1517000	The arcade that had Para Para Paradise is out of business.
1517000	1518000	Hmm.
1518000	1521000	The Arcadia Bunning Games or whatever it's called,
1521000	1523000	the kind of crappy ghetto.
1523000	1524000	Oh, the little crappy, yeah.
1524000	1525000	But they had a Para Para machine.
1525000	1527000	I'm not surprised they had it all. They went out of business.
1527000	1528000	They're gone.
1528000	1529000	It really was a matter of time.
1529000	1533000	I wanted to go play Para Para because I don't have Dance Masters.
1533000	1535000	Their location really was never that good.
1535000	1540000	But we should buy that place and open up the actual Orange Lounge arcade in batting cages.
1540000	1541000	That would be great.
1541000	1543000	See, I bet it's dirt cheap.
1543000	1546000	All right. Anyhow, go into our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeready.com.
1546000	1548000	Derek H. is in our chatroom saying,
1548000	1554000	Rob is correct. Even Carmen Electra's aerobic striptease workout DVDs have an extensive stretching section.
1554000	1555000	See?
1555000	1557000	And even if your pole dancing classes tell you,
1557000	1560000	and I don't know why Derek H. knows so much about pole dancing classes,
1560000	1562000	but I'll just assume he does,
1562000	1565000	even if they're getting you to stretch,
1565000	1571000	you know that these games need to make sure they are incorporating that into their customized workouts.
1571000	1572000	All right.
1572000	1574000	Anyhow, let's move on.
1574000	1575000	That's it for our gaming weeks.
1575000	1576000	Quickly, housekeeping.
1576000	1579000	Make sure you follow us on all those great websites around the interwebs.
1579000	1584000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R or Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1584000	1590000	They kick businesses off of Google Plus right now, so we are not on Google Plus.
1590000	1593000	You can follow one of us, this individual, or actually, Loki.
1593000	1595000	Loki refuses to make the switch to Plus, right?
1595000	1598000	I'm not going to get Plus. Screw that.
1598000	1602000	Well, I'm on there, and so is Dark Sakura, so you can follow us.
1602000	1604000	I have a circle for O-L-R people, so it works.
1604000	1608000	And occasionally, I'll post O-L-R related things.
1608000	1611000	But also, I want to plug our website.
1611000	1617000	Had some very minor changes to it this week just in graphics with some of the quick links to some things.
1617000	1620000	We now have a link to the Tumblr.
1620000	1624000	Orange Lounge Radio has an official Tumblr account for you hipster people that like to tumble.
1624000	1627000	We have that, and we incorporated the Ustream in there.
1627000	1632000	Even though we haven't been using it that much after the E3, you never know when we might go back to that at some point.
1632000	1634000	So I want to make sure people would follow us on there if they wanted to.
1634000	1637000	So check that out. OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1637000	1639000	All right, enough housekeeping. Let's get to video game news.
1639000	1641000	Loki starts off tonight.
1641000	1650000	We're starting off with a comment from one of the Sony Network Entertainment execs, the president Tim Schafe,
1650000	1658000	who spoke at GamesBeat 2011 about the PlayStation Network downtime.
1658000	1662000	And he said, Sony is very pleasantly surprised by the experience.
1662000	1665000	The customers have all come back, and the network performance is better than ever.
1665000	1668000	Sales are better than ever.
1668000	1674000	So just goes to show you, all those people are like, you know, they're done for.
1674000	1679000	They ended up selling a lot more because of this.
1679000	1686000	And then it says, of course, the downtime costs Sony approximately $171 million.
1686000	1689000	You know, they would not like to do it again, obviously.
1689000	1694000	They said one time was enough, but it was a great learning experience. We agree.
1694000	1697000	That was a very interesting choice of words.
1697000	1701000	It was a learning experience, but once is enough.
1701000	1706000	That isn't the most politically correct statement.
1706000	1713000	He had to explain a little bit, because the first quote was, it was a great experience.
1713000	1718000	No, that's not exactly how you would describe that.
1718000	1721000	A humbling experience might be a little bit better.
1721000	1726000	I'm just saying, do you know how many times in my day-to-day job I use a phrase like that?
1726000	1728000	You know, because people make mistakes all the time.
1728000	1730000	And you know, it's frustrating to make mistakes.
1730000	1734000	You want to, especially when you're at your job, you want to do the best job you possibly can.
1734000	1736000	But a lot of times people make mistakes.
1736000	1738000	It's just, it's a learning experience.
1738000	1739000	We just, we have to learn from it.
1739000	1741000	And we make mistakes in here. It's okay.
1741000	1745000	This is very funny to hear Sony kind of use that same.
1745000	1748000	This was a learning experience.
1748000	1755000	But they are planning to invest some money to make sure that the PlayStation Network is secure.
1755000	1757000	They're committing 20 million dollars.
1757000	1763000	And they're also seeking out independent developers to create games like, you know,
1763000	1768000	Pixel Junk, Side Scroller, and Papoyo, Boku stuff.
1768000	1773000	They're also saying that they're going to be, you know,
1773000	1778000	doing this pub fun to bring innovative, different, unique gameplay to the PlayStation Network.
1778000	1781000	So they're kind of trying to beef up their content on there,
1781000	1788000	because it could use a little bit of beefing up.
1788000	1792000	So that's kind of cool.
1792000	1797000	Yeah, I'm glad they're kind of bringing in all that extra support.
1797000	1802000	Also, I think all this talk about how Google was going to go under, or I'm sorry, not Google, excuse me.
1802000	1804000	I'm still thinking about Plus and all that.
1804000	1809000	But how PlayStation was going to go under and all that after the hacking and all that.
1809000	1813000	It seems to be a distant memory at this point.
1813000	1816000	I'm looking at a comment in our chat room from Blender says,
1816000	1820000	Uncharted 3 Beta had 1.53 million players, by the way.
1820000	1823000	And I do remember reading about that on the internet earlier this week.
1823000	1827000	And I think a story had said it's the biggest PlayStation Beta that's ever happened.
1827000	1832000	So it certainly gives the impression that people have pretty much forgiven Sony,
1832000	1835000	and we've all moved on with our lives, and we're back on PlayStation Network.
1835000	1841000	But there's also, I guess, that sense of fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
1841000	1847000	If something bad happens again, I think you'll see a lot of people really mean it this time and leave.
1847000	1852000	Of course, it also helps that it's Uncharted 3. It's a huge game.
1852000	1855000	So of course, it's going to be one of their largest Betas they've ever had.
1855000	1859000	So there you go.
1859000	1863000	All right, moving on to some more stories about PlayStation.
1863000	1868000	This also kind of directly relates to the hack, you know, now that we're about, what, a month afterwards here.
1868000	1872000	Apparently, this is from Capcom, which is interesting.
1872000	1877000	This is from the Capcom Europe head David Reeves was quoted saying this.
1877000	1882000	We have seen on PlayStation Network, and probably Sony are in a better place to tell you this,
1882000	1887000	that there is a resurgence in people buying the generic PSN cards in retail stores
1887000	1890000	rather than putting up their credit card details.
1890000	1894000	I think in the future, they will make more non-generic cards, like game-branded ones,
1894000	1898000	such as Street Fighter or FIFA, or even Modern Warfare.
1898000	1900000	But the generic ones have done well.
1900000	1903000	People are playing it a bit safe at the moment because the hackers will be back.
1903000	1907000	That's my personal opinion. I mean, they will, right?
1907000	1910000	I don't know if that's really the best thing to be saying there, but...
1910000	1912000	Oh, shut up, Capcom.
1912000	1916000	You know, we see that they're buying more generic cards.
1916000	1922000	Yeah, hopefully they're not buying your games with your crappy DRM shit.
1922000	1925000	Oh, your games didn't work during the whole PlayStation Network outage,
1925000	1928000	or at least your two PlayStation Network games.
1928000	1930000	Those are awfully pretty good spirits to be in
1930000	1934000	when you consider they missed out on all those weeks of sales, you know?
1934000	1936000	I'm kind of surprised it wasn't...
1936000	1941000	I mean, granted, that might be one quote out of a much larger interview, but still.
1941000	1945000	It's because they need them more than Sony needs them, you know?
1945000	1953000	Because if they stop supporting Sony, then their sales kind of get cut in about half.
1953000	1958000	Whereas if Sony loses them, there's plenty of other developers out there
1958000	1962000	and plenty of other publishers that put content on their system.
1962000	1969000	Well, have you used your credit card to buy stuff on PlayStation Network at all?
1969000	1970000	Either of you?
1970000	1971000	We did.
1971000	1973000	That was just from Moondiver.
1973000	1976000	Have you gone back after the hack?
1976000	1981000	We haven't really wanted anything else, but Dan got the freebies.
1981000	1984000	Yeah, I got the freebies. I don't know if I bought anything on PSN.
1984000	1989000	I try not to buy anything on there, not because I'm afraid of my credit card information being hacked,
1989000	1992000	but because I don't want to spend money on their network.
1992000	1994000	And that goes for Microsoft, too.
1994000	1998000	I don't really want to buy anything, because I got into the habit where,
1998000	2004000	oh, I got to buy all the Xbox Live Arcade games, and I did that for a while.
2004000	2006000	How many of them do I play now?
2006000	2008000	None of them.
2008000	2016000	So the last thing I bought on there, I think, was the Pirates of the Caribbean expansion for LittleBigPlanet.
2016000	2018000	And that was the last thing that I purchased on there.
2018000	2024000	And honestly, I don't see myself really purchasing anything else for there.
2024000	2030000	You never know. I don't know.
2030000	2036000	If I'm going to purchase download content for something, most of the time I'm gaming on my 360 anyway.
2036000	2039000	I don't think I've bought anything since the hack happened,
2039000	2048000	but I will say that Salacious Pop is strongly encouraging me to get the arcade Super Street Fighter
2048000	2054000	Arcade Edition expansion there on PlayStation Network, because that's where we own Super Street Fighter IV.
2054000	2057000	So I may have to buy something in the near future. We'll see.
2057000	2060000	Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.
2060000	2062000	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
2062000	2064000	Well, I have some Ubisoft news.
2064000	2070000	They have confirmed that there is going to be an online pass to be used for its games.
2070000	2072000	It's called the Uplay Passport.
2072000	2082000	It's $9.99, basically $10, for access to the online features of many of their core games when bought second hand.
2082000	2090000	So if you bought the game, you have a registration code that comes in it, and it has exclusive bonus content and whatnot.
2090000	2094000	But the first game that's going to be using this is Driver San Francisco.
2094000	2098000	No UK price yet.
2098000	2102000	Alright, well, Loki, aren't you excited to hear about this?
2102000	2108000	You know, it's just another company jumping on this horrible bandwagon, and I don't see the point.
2108000	2115000	And I was trying to find, there was another article that actually had their press release for that in there,
2115000	2124000	and I really want to find that so that I can, oh here we go, so they can read you their PR spin on this, and it's just ridiculous.
2124000	2133000	It's what gamers want. Gamers want that premium experience that their $10 goes to help.
2133000	2140000	Uh, let's see, I'm trying to find, god I really wish I had it.
2140000	2152000	Basically, they spun it as, it allows us, you know, extra content like online multiplayer and stuff like that.
2152000	2163000	I'm sorry, if I'm buying a game that has online multiplayer in it, and that does, because it does brand new, so therefore it should, you know, use,
2163000	2167000	I don't understand why I should have to pay extra if I'm buying used.
2167000	2175000	Now I've heard people make, and I gotta say the most ridiculous and stupid comment saying,
2175000	2183000	oh well you know, they've gotta pay for their servers, and you know, if you buy used, the game publisher doesn't, or the game developer doesn't get any money.
2183000	2189000	Let me correct you on a few things right here, okay, it's hilarious how stupid a comment that is.
2189000	2197000	One, all used games start off as new at some point, so they've made their money for that game to fund that online network.
2197000	2204000	I have to be devil's advocate and give you the counterpoint, but if the game wasn't being sold used, then that would force someone to buy it new.
2204000	2209000	Not necessarily, because some people might not buy it, they may just skip it altogether.
2209000	2216000	And whereas if you got a used sale, you may have the chance that other people might enjoy that game, and they may later on decide,
2216000	2221000	hey you know what, I'm gonna go pick up, you know, later, you know, more games from this developer or whatnot.
2221000	2229000	And, on top of all that, you're saying, you know, people say that the developer doesn't get money for used sales.
2229000	2234000	Well, it doesn't matter, because the developer already got paid when the game got pressed.
2234000	2243000	Okay, yeah, they get some kickbacks for sales and stuff like that, but you know what, it's not, you know, it doesn't matter if they sell them in the stores.
2243000	2247000	They've already sold them to those stores, they've already made their money.
2247000	2252000	You know, they could sell, you know, 100,000 copies and they could be all sitting on, you know, store shelves.
2252000	2256000	It doesn't fucking matter, because the publisher and developer got paid.
2256000	2259000	Going to our chatroom for some comments, chat.orangesonshady.com.
2259000	2262000	Sterlok says, cool, more games I'm not buying.
2262000	2266000	Dartetsuya says, they fuck us over and for whatever reason, people still step up to defend them.
2266000	2273000	Okay, well, I'm not necessarily defending this here, but I have to, well, yes and no, because I have to be honest.
2273000	2279000	A lot of this news story I just kind of roll my eyes at and I'm like, I don't care, because I really do buy most of my stuff new.
2279000	2283000	Like, either I'm gonna buy it new, or I'm gonna get it on one of those rental accounts.
2283000	2290000	And there are very few games that I would play online that I wouldn't just buy new.
2290000	2295000	Most games I want to play online with friends, I'm excited about and I want to buy them right away.
2295000	2297000	But you're not seeing the writing on the wall, Rob.
2297000	2299000	You see, if you give them an inch, they're gonna take a mile.
2299000	2307000	If you start thinking that this is an okay thing for them to do, then everybody jumps on board and they start doing this for multiplayer.
2307000	2315000	Then you know what? Then they start going, hey, you know, we're noticing that it seems that our used game sales or whatever, our new sales, aren't really being impacted enough.
2315000	2324000	We need to make sure that this is really something that people are gonna want to buy new by adding more content for this pass or whatever.
2324000	2333000	So they're gonna start taking more stuff out of the single player games and they're gonna start dipping into other things that would have normally been free download content or something like that.
2333000	2338000	Just because people are okay with it and people are supporting them and actually defending them in this process.
2338000	2342000	So that's the point. You gotta stop it now.
2342000	2347000	You can't wait until later on when they're like, oh, well, it doesn't matter because I buy a lot of games new.
2347000	2356000	Yeah, until they start saying, oh, hey, you know what? We can make a lot more money by charging for online multiplayer by having it download content or something.
2356000	2363000	I will say it does piss me off. And this is interesting because I do kind of have different opinions depending on what system it is.
2363000	2370000	I kind of think the PlayStation 3 has a little more room to get away with what they're doing here than Xbox Live does.
2370000	2377000	As far as I'm concerned, every game should be fucking playable online because I pay that fee for Xbox Live every year. Period.
2377000	2380000	And when there does come a day, and you're right, maybe I shouldn't wait for it.
2380000	2387000	But I will tell you when that day doesn't ever become that maybe there is a game I want to play online that's subject to this project $10 thing on Xbox Live.
2387000	2391000	I'm going to be irate, and I refuse to support it on Xbox.
2391000	2397000	And I will take Microsoft to task for that because Microsoft's allowing it to happen by selling it on their store.
2397000	2403000	And I'm sorry, that's double dipping. You're charging me twice for the same thing, and that is to play my game online.
2403000	2408000	So I honestly think the company that needs to put their foot down is Microsoft.
2408000	2415000	Sony, they're providing a free service. It's harder to get mad at them on that side.
2415000	2419000	Because you aren't paying for online over there. The whole infrastructure is free.
2419000	2425000	And to say that to charge $10 for maintenance, you can get away with that a lot more on that end than you can on Microsoft's end.
2425000	2434000	I'm already paying for maintenance. I don't give a fuck if you said that, well, you're going to let servers or companies run their own servers like EA
2434000	2438000	because otherwise they're not going to host games on Xbox Live.
2438000	2441000	That's your fucking problem, and that's for you guys to work out.
2441000	2444000	Moment I get double dipped for online charges, I am out.
2444000	2447000	Sony Fanboy 4 life, you all.
2447000	2450000	For the record, just because easily wanted to hear it?
2450000	2451000	Sure.
2451000	2452000	Objection!
2452000	2459000	Well, I mean, it's like I've said before, and you know, no one seemed to care then, and it's happening more now.
2459000	2468000	And yeah, it doesn't really bother me too much because I don't buy Wii games, but there's a lot of Wii games out there nowadays that, you know,
2468000	2478000	maybe music games, maybe, you know, I don't know, just some other type of game, but where they're charging $60 for it.
2478000	2482000	No one said anything, so you know what, this is something that's now commonly happening.
2482000	2491000	Like for example, and I mean, this is definitely not a game I'm buying, but you know, like that Spyro fucking game that's coming out.
2491000	2500000	The new Spyro Skylanders Adventurer bullshit thing that they're selling some stupid, I don't even know what the hell it is,
2500000	2505000	piece of plastic that you gotta put little figurines on to play as those characters in the game.
2505000	2507000	It's basically like physical download content.
2507000	2512000	They're charging $80 for this fucking game, so that's gonna be fail right there.
2512000	2517000	And on top of all that, they're gonna sell additional characters for like three bucks each.
2517000	2528000	Like stupid little toys, and they're hoping that people get suckered into this because zuzu pets and these squinkies bullshit toys that kids like nowadays.
2528000	2531000	I don't even know what, I've never fucking heard of a zuzu in my life.
2531000	2539000	A zuzu pet, it was like a couple Christmases ago, it was like the hottest toy ever, it's a stupid toy hamster that moves around.
2539000	2542000	Oh, those horrid things and whatever.
2542000	2548000	Yes, I know. Listen, kids are starting out stupid early on, okay, and they just become stupid adults. I know.
2548000	2550000	I hope Richard Gere doesn't own a zuzu.
2550000	2564000	Yeah, so it's just dumb, and they're trying all these different tactics to get money for things they really shouldn't be getting money for.
2564000	2568000	Developers getting money for used games, fuck it, you shouldn't get money for used games.
2568000	2575000	That's it. It's a market, it's just a market that was created by people, and it doesn't even have to be necessarily that.
2575000	2583000	Let's say, for example, Rob, I loan you a copy of my game, and you want to play it online. You can't, you have to pay $10 now.
2583000	2588000	Why? Oh, because it's someone else accessing their network.
2588000	2591000	And I've already paid for that on Xbox Live.
2591000	2593000	Yes.
2593000	2600000	They just use the more subscription model based thing, but I'm telling you, I've been an Xbox Live member for like six, seven years.
2600000	2607000	If they allow this shit to continue, I'm out. You know what I mean? There will come a point, probably, where there's a game I'm going to want to play online.
2607000	2611000	I'm going to be pissed that I'm double-dipping, and I'm canceling Xbox Live when that happens.
2611000	2625000	If Sony's doing it, if Ubisoft's doing it, EA's doing it, THQ's doing it, Warner Games is doing it, it's not going to be long before everybody jumps on board with this, and hopefully not Microsoft.
2625000	2634000	Interesting comment from Rom—well, okay. If Microsoft did it, now, they need to be called out if that happens, because—oh my god.
2634000	2635000	All right, anyway.
2635000	2637000	Raman, our chat room at chat.ornisontree.com.
2637000	2641000	You know, if you're patient enough, you can buy the games as new when the price drops.
2641000	2643000	Not that serious to get the game on day one.
2643000	2649000	I'd rather wait a few weeks for the game to drop to $30, $40 new than wait a week and buy it used for $45, $50.
2649000	2658000	You know, that's a damn good point. You know, why not just kind of wait for it to drop the price new, and then really it's no better than buying it used, right?
2658000	2662000	Or, it is better, because you're not having to get subject to this whole $10 thing, right?
2662000	2669000	That is technically a way to get it cheaper, but people want their games right away.
2669000	2674000	But, you know, the way I look at it is, if you're buying it used anyways, you're probably not getting it day one anyways.
2674000	2680000	So just wait even longer. In a game like Driver, I mean, let's look at Driver.
2680000	2683000	I mean, the pedigree of Driver hasn't been that great.
2683000	2690000	The first one was great, the second one was all right, the third one was terrible, and the fourth one, eh, kind of terrible as well.
2690000	2694000	So, the fifth one, eh, I wouldn't be surprised if it's terrible.
2694000	2699000	And it's definitely not a game I'd be playing online anyways.
2699000	2707000	All right, let's move on with some other topics here before we make Loki's head explode.
2707000	2718000	This is hilarious. Now, the PlayStation Vita, last thing I thought it would probably be getting would be Final Fantasy XI,
2718000	2725000	but apparently Square Enix is actually looking at maybe porting Final Fantasy XI to the PlayStation Vita.
2725000	2729000	No mention of Final Fantasy XIV. That just doesn't exist.
2729000	2739000	But Final Fantasy XI, their only online game in the Final Fantasy series, will be possibly ported to the PlayStation Vita.
2739000	2742000	Their only online game?
2742000	2744000	In the Final Fantasy series.
2744000	2748000	What? Did they just totally forget about Final Fantasy XIV?
2748000	2750000	No, no, no, that's my comments.
2750000	2752000	Oh, I see, I see. Okay.
2752000	2759000	XIV doesn't exist. No, it's just, it's kind of interesting though if they did that,
2759000	2767000	but I think it'd be kind of cool, because think about it, you know, MMOs haven't really come to handhelds, so...
2767000	2770000	Yeah, not that I can think of. Or maybe Phantasy Star.
2770000	2771000	Phantasy Star, maybe.
2771000	2775000	Well, actually, but the Phantasy Star portable games were, contained little single player games.
2775000	2778000	They were like, they were a lot like Universe's single player mode.
2778000	2783000	So, yeah, I'd like that. I'd welcome that, actually.
2783000	2787000	I hear Final Fantasy XI's made, it's still going, it's still improving.
2787000	2789000	They did graphical improvements.
2789000	2796000	If you're a PC player, you got some new graphic textures this last go around, so I think that's, I think that's kind of rad.
2796000	2805000	I don't think it's really possible to put XIV on a portable platform, because despite the fact that everybody criticizes it for being poop,
2805000	2811000	it was a really good looking game, and the Vita probably just doesn't possess the power graphically to pull it off.
2811000	2816000	But, you know, XI was a game that was made for the PS2, and that's the biggest drawback to XI,
2816000	2819000	is that everything they do on XI still has to support the PlayStation 2,
2819000	2823000	because a lot of folks in Japan, that's how they adopted it, was on the PS2.
2823000	2828000	So, until there comes a day where they say, well, we no longer are going to support the old platform,
2828000	2830000	so I just don't see them being able to do that.
2830000	2839000	I think that's what XIV was trying to do, but failed miserably because they didn't make the, they tried to change the core game,
2839000	2845000	and they took out the goddamn auction houses, which every MMO like, needs, so I don't, oh my god.
2845000	2849000	And they kept the same races, but changed the names, that's just stupid.
2849000	2856000	Yeah, so anyway, I think it's a neat idea to have, especially considering the Vitas are supposed to have 3G in them and everything,
2856000	2858000	like, I think that's kind of a cool use.
2858000	2865000	I would be curious what other types of MMOs come out of this, maybe not just ports of old stuff, but some new ideas,
2865000	2871000	especially because, isn't part of the whole Vitas thing supposed to be finding gamers around you?
2871000	2879000	Well, yeah, you've got, you know, GPS built into them, and, you know, all the different little services that they have and stuff.
2879000	2887000	Can you imagine an MMO where you would actually have to, like, be within so many feet of a person in order to fight them?
2887000	2893000	Like, so you encounter people IRL? Like, I don't know, like, I just, there's got to be great ways to integrate-
2893000	2895000	It sounds like a bad, bad, like, Pokemon-
2895000	2900000	I know, it sounds like a bad, like, molester thing waiting to happen, but I don't know, I just kind of think, like-
2900000	2903000	If you don't defeat me, I will rape you.
2903000	2911000	It just, I don't know, it just sounds like a neat thing to kind of integrate the GPS stuff into MMOs somehow, I don't know.
2911000	2918000	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Spazinator says, Final Fantasy XI would be a system seller.
2918000	2920000	I used to love it on the PlayStation 2.
2920000	2923000	Tigerclaw says, MMOs on a PlayStation Vita.
2923000	2930000	I sense you can do some sort of transferring type of stuff from the PlayStation 3 to the Vita with MMOs.
2930000	2934000	It's very hard to play Final Fantasy XI on a PlayStation 3.
2934000	2940000	Like, you could do it, but you have to have the exact right model of PlayStation in order to be able to play it.
2940000	2941000	I do!
2941000	2950000	Yeah, I know, you have to have, like, the- and I'm not, like, it's not even just the backward compatible ones, like, there's one that has some type of port that the hard drive attaches to,
2950000	2955000	because I don't think you can use PlayStation 3's hard drive for 11, can you? I can't remember.
2955000	2963000	No, you, well, you can't at all, because it's a three and a half drive versus a laptop SATA drive, and it's an old IDE drive.
2963000	2978000	So you would have to clone, well, I think they had something that you could download off the PlayStation Network that was basically the cloned hard drive information, I think, for the Final Fantasy XI stuff.
2978000	2982000	This is a curious comment from Spaznator in our chat room.
2982000	2987000	With Final Fantasy XI being on the Vita, I may reconsider my position on the system.
2987000	2997000	So it sounds to me like Final Fantasy XI is, like, a must-have game, even though it's an old game, it's kind of like, it's revisiting an old friend, or it's having a port of something on a platform.
2997000	3001000	Are the Vita launch games really that bad looking so far?
3001000	3007000	Where it's taking a- how old is Final Fantasy XI? It's about as old as this show, isn't it?
3007000	3009000	I think it came out in 02 in Japan, right?
3009000	3010000	Yes.
3010000	3011000	It's a nine year old game.
3011000	3012000	Let me put it this way.
3012000	3021000	Launch titles right now are pretty sparse. They haven't really said what they're launching with yet.
3021000	3025000	Other than Uncharted, Uncharted is a big title for that.
3025000	3030000	Of course. Well, there was that neat looking dungeon game with the whole PlayStation 3 integration I thought was neat.
3030000	3038000	But that's about it. They haven't really said yet what a lot of launch games are going to be. It's still really early, I think.
3038000	3039000	Right.
3039000	3042000	Alright, well moving on to other stories about the Vita.
3042000	3047000	This has to do with a developer comment on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.
3047000	3051000	And it comes from Naughty Dog game director Justin Richman.
3051000	3058000	Of course Naughty Dog is the group behind Uncharted, as well as classics like Crash Bandicoot.
3058000	3060000	So they've always been in Sony's camp, obviously.
3060000	3066000	But saying a pretty big slam that's pro Sony and anti-Nintendo.
3066000	3069000	In an interview with Now Gamer, Justin Richman said, quote,
3069000	3073000	To be honest with you, the idea of it is very, very cool, speaking about the Wii U.
3073000	3077000	But there's nothing that the Wii U has that the Vita and PlayStation 3 doesn't.
3077000	3081000	You know, it's an interesting piece of technology and I'm interested to see how people use it.
3081000	3083000	I'm not completely sold yet.
3083000	3085000	That the screen isn't multi-touch, that's a little weird.
3085000	3088000	It seems that there are some very strange holes in it.
3088000	3091000	But to be fair, last time I was skeptical of the original Wii and look at how that did.
3091000	3095000	I'm sure the games they make for Wii U will be amazing.
3095000	3103000	Finally, I'm seeing that whole observation in the mainstream media that, hell, not even the Vita.
3103000	3109000	But the PSP and the PlayStation 3 was kind of capable of that same technology of having a portable screen in your hand.
3109000	3113000	And he brings up a point, I forgot, the Vita has a touchscreen.
3113000	3115000	It is going to be just like the Wii U.
3115000	3122000	If you have, I mean, granted, it'll be between a PlayStation 3 and a Vita way more expensive than a Wii U most likely will be.
3122000	3124000	But he's got a good point.
3124000	3130000	Couldn't you have the same game on the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 that you do on the Wii U?
3130000	3136000	Could we see ports of games made for the Wii U come out on the PlayStation because it has that same capability?
3136000	3139000	Well, on top of that, it's got that back touch thing too.
3139000	3140000	True.
3140000	3142000	So that could even add another dimension.
3142000	3146000	You would see it, or you may see it, but there's going to be very few.
3146000	3150000	I mean, no one's going to expect people to have two, three hundred dollar systems.
3150000	3155000	Well, yeah, you're right. The ports would be a little weird on the Sony end, but you know...
3155000	3158000	It'd be like something like, here's some really optional way to play this.
3158000	3162000	Maybe not like right away, but what about further down the line?
3162000	3166000	Or what about a game like, I don't know, Arkham Asylum is supposed to be on the Wii U, right?
3166000	3167000	So...
3167000	3172000	That's retarded. Oh, yeah. It'll be out on the Wii U a year after it comes out. Awesome!
3172000	3177000	Well, it'll have some stinkin' bonus feature, something that everybody has to have.
3177000	3184000	But my curiosity is, couldn't they release a similar game of the year edition, quote unquote,
3184000	3192000	on the PlayStation 3, that could optionally bring up the Vita to do whatever the Wii U screen is doing?
3192000	3197000	Yeah, it could, but people would just shrug their shoulders and say,
3197000	3202000	I'm not buying another fuckin' two hundred ninety-nine dollar system so that I can do this.
3202000	3208000	True, but I don't know. If it's an optional and not a mandatory enhancement, does that make sense?
3208000	3212000	It would be like if, you know, Grind Turismo 5 was coming out, say, next year,
3212000	3217000	and the Vita, you could buy the Vita and use it as a rear view mirror.
3217000	3221000	Would someone do that? Sure, I'm sure there's someone out there that would do that.
3221000	3225000	Which is what they had showed off that the PS3 was supposed to do in 2006.
3225000	3231000	Now, is that necessarily a good use of your two hundred ninety-nine dollars? Probably not.
3231000	3238000	Alright, well, we'll see what happens when the games get a little closer to coming out for the Wii U,
3238000	3244000	and when the Vita comes out, exactly what types of technology we see beyond what we've just seen at E3.
3244000	3245000	Moving on.
3245000	3251000	Well, there is a dream come true for many, many people in West Virginia.
3251000	3254000	Well, first of all, I will rewind.
3254000	3256000	People stop making jokes about West Virginia?
3256000	3258000	Hi, we're in West Virginia.
3258000	3265000	Now, Konami is going to have the Childhood Obesity Summit in West Virginia this month,
3265000	3269000	and then they're going to have a DDR tournament for school-aged children in West Virginia.
3269000	3272000	I hear that's going to be a cool summit, except there's going to be a lot of fatties.
3272000	3274000	Stop it.
3274000	3277000	Sorry.
3277000	3281000	At any rate, it's going to be held July 27th and 28th in Charleston,
3281000	3286000	and it will have representatives from the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition,
3286000	3294000	the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Michael Danziger from The Biggest Loser,
3294000	3297000	and they will also have the West Virginia University Extension Service
3297000	3301000	and West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency hosting it.
3301000	3303000	So there will be prizes.
3303000	3312000	They're mainly scholarships, and they're hoping that they can just get kids more active.
3312000	3319000	There will also be a technician on hand to maintain the DDR pads as they keep breaking.
3319000	3321000	What are you talking about? This is DDR.
3321000	3324000	There will be no technician to, you know, tech those pads.
3324000	3326000	I think it's a good idea.
3326000	3329000	I wish they had DDR at my gym.
3329000	3333000	Anything that gets kids motivated to exercise is a good thing, I think.
3333000	3335000	You know, we shouldn't be making fun of it.
3335000	3339000	But it is, you have to admit, the idea of an obesity summit,
3339000	3344000	doesn't that seem the slightest bit condescending to you?
3344000	3346000	Well...
3346000	3351000	Hey, anything that gets more DDR machines out there, I mean, that's all I'm saying.
3351000	3355000	It's just like the parents telling the kids, you're going to summer camp, yay!
3355000	3359000	What camp are we going to? Camp Thin and Beautiful.
3359000	3364000	You know what? I really think that it's a good start.
3364000	3370000	I think it's a good thing, but really a lot of it is going to start with parental education.
3370000	3372000	You've got to look at what the influences are on the kid.
3372000	3374000	Right.
3374000	3379000	You can buy all the DDR you want, but at the end of the day, it has to be the parent that says,
3379000	3383000	no, you can't have a donut until you have mowed the lawn, or whatever.
3383000	3385000	Right, or eat your vegetables first.
3385000	3386000	Yeah.
3386000	3388000	You know.
3388000	3392000	Alright. Well, we'll see what comes of that, and we'll let you know.
3392000	3396000	We'll let you know how big of a score the winner of the DDR tournament racks up.
3396000	3398000	I had to, sorry.
3398000	3402000	Alright, let's travel the world and look at some upcoming release dates and games that are coming out soon.
3402000	3404000	There's not a whole lot this week.
3404000	3410000	This week, it's basically Call of Juarez the Cartel on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3410000	3417000	Also, Captain America Super Soldier, that's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
3417000	3422000	Wii DS, and actually, that's it.
3422000	3431000	Then also, the Smurfs, in case you forgot, they have a movie coming out.
3431000	3433000	There's the Smurfs on the DS.
3433000	3440000	And because Ubisoft loves their dancing games, Smurfs Dance Party, which I saw a YouTube clip out there
3440000	3446000	with one of the Smurf songs, Who Let the Smurfs Out?
3446000	3449000	I wanted to stab a needle into my ear.
3449000	3452000	It seriously was terrible.
3452000	3456000	And I also believe that, what was it?
3456000	3459000	Just Dance Summer Party will be coming out as well on the Wii.
3459000	3461000	And that's it.
3461000	3466000	I'm sorry, do you know what I have stuck in my head thanks to the whole talk about going to fat camp
3466000	3468000	and going to summer camp?
3468000	3470000	You know what I have stuck in my head now?
3470000	3477000	Are you going to slit your shorts?
3501000	3504000	I hope we never part.
3504000	3507000	That's a great idea for something.
3507000	3511000	And this has totally made me think of it for some reason.
3511000	3515000	Wouldn't it be awesome if they had some sort of social network thing where you could basically
3515000	3518000	create your own TV stations that people can watch?
3518000	3524000	Actual programming, actual TV syndicated programming that you can basically design the lineup for
3524000	3528000	and have that play, and people would favor it and stuff.
3528000	3531000	Doesn't Hulu have a playlist?
3531000	3538000	It's funny, and it's huge this week too, the big buzz in the industry right now is Spotify,
3538000	3542000	the new music service from Britain that's coming out over here.
3542000	3544000	They've rolled it out, it's all invite only and stuff.
3544000	3548000	I got an invite, thanks to our lovely webmaster Jason,
3548000	3552000	and he got me an invite to the service.
3552000	3556000	It kind of looks like iTunes, kind of mixed with Napster.
3556000	3560000	One of the big things is that you can build playlists and then share them on Facebook,
3560000	3563000	and anybody can call up your playlist and play the songs,
3563000	3566000	because it's essentially kind of Napster in that way.
3566000	3571000	New Napster, not old Napster, but the new one that's subscribed to the service and get everything.
3571000	3576000	But it's free for right now, it's limited to 10 hours a month or something like that on free,
3576000	3579000	but it's a good way to get exposed to some new songs.
3579000	3582000	Kind of what you're describing to me sounds like that with TV,
3582000	3584000	because you'd be making a television playlist, right?
3584000	3587000	Sort of. I guess it's sort of like a YouTube playlist or something,
3587000	3592000	but I was thinking it'd be kind of cool, because I've always thought,
3592000	3596000	hey, I've got some great ideas for TV stations and stuff as far as,
3596000	3601000	hey, why don't they have an 80s TV station with 80s programming?
3601000	3604000	Well, 80s commercials for products.
3604000	3608000	You could just have the Lysol commercial, whatever, from the 80s,
3608000	3610000	but it's still advertising products that you have now,
3610000	3616000	or if people have products out there right now that they want to make an 80s-type commercial for,
3616000	3618000	that'd be pretty awesome.
3618000	3623000	Well, apparently there's this, and you know how they used to have the Nickelodeon Game and Sports channel?
3623000	3625000	I don't think it's around anymore, is it?
3625000	3628000	It used to show the Legends of the Hidden Temple and Guts and all that stuff.
3628000	3631000	Well, now there's a TeenNick channel that might have replaced that?
3631000	3633000	No, it's been around for a while.
3633000	3637000	Okay, well, I guess TeenNick has a whole now 90s segment coming back,
3637000	3640000	and they're going to show all the shows from the 90s on this,
3640000	3644000	so you know I'm going to be camped out in front of TeenNick.
3644000	3649000	My 33-year-old ass will be camped out in front of TeenNick when they do the marathon for this.
3650000	3654000	Yes! I totally watched the crap out of that show.
3659000	3662000	What have any of these people done since it's set for her?
3662000	3666000	Isn't she on a show on ABC Family with Joey Lawrence or something?
3666000	3667000	I think.
3667000	3669000	She's done a few things.
3673000	3676000	Those poor parents probably don't get recognized for anything else than,
3676000	3678000	Hey, it's Clarissa's parents!
3678000	3679000	Anyhow.
3679000	3684000	True story, did you know that they made a pilot for a CBS TV show that was like Clarissa Grows Up or something like that?
3684000	3685000	Yes.
3685000	3687000	That was something about her becoming a journalist.
3687000	3691000	It really had nothing to do with the old show, but it just was her.
3691000	3692000	It would have been cool.
3692000	3695000	Yeah, but it didn't get picked up, so she went to do Sabrina instead.
3695000	3696000	Now we're talking.
3696000	3698000	Well, um, you know what?
3698000	3706000	Okay, there was another show that was on Nickelodeon when I was probably 19?
3706000	3708000	But it was called, um, what was it called?
3708000	3710000	It was like some soap opera.
3710000	3712000	They tried to do, like, the Teenage Soap Opera.
3712000	3714000	Oh, 14!
3714000	3715000	No, it wasn't 14.
3715000	3716000	Or 15.
3716000	3717000	Yeah, 15 or 17 or something like that.
3717000	3718000	It was one of those ages.
3718000	3719000	15, I think, was the show.
3719000	3720000	Yeah.
3720000	3722000	And we're all the British programming that they used to have.
3722000	3725000	I just remember you can't do that on television.
3725000	3727000	That was the greatest show ever on that network.
3727000	3730000	The other thing that they did was introduce me to one of my favorite shows of all time.
3730000	3731000	Shut up, Moose!
3731000	3732000	The Tomorrow People.
3732000	3733000	Oh, yeah.
3733000	3735000	Which actually was a BBC program.
3735000	3736000	That's what I was talking about.
3736000	3740000	It was a full serial, and the series had been around since the 70s.
3740000	3745000	But I loved that damn show, and I watched the entire thing, and I've downloaded it.
3745000	3746000	Alright, let me move on.
3746000	3748000	If it was out on DVD, I'd freaking buy it.
3748000	3749000	Alright, let me move on.
3749000	3751000	Uh, release dates for Japan.
3751000	3753000	Did I get from release dates to Clarissa Explains It All?
3753000	3754000	Yeah, that was my fault.
3754000	3755000	I don't know.
3755000	3756000	Welcome to Orange Lawns Radio.
3756000	3759000	Alright, on the Xbox 360, some games coming out very soon.
3759000	3766000	Alice Madness returns in Japan, as well as F.E.A.R., F3AR.
3766000	3770000	Final Fantasy XIII International Edition comes to the Xbox 360 as well.
3770000	3772000	I'm sorry, that's a price reduction.
3772000	3773000	Sorry.
3773000	3777000	We'll only set you back about half as much as it did before.
3777000	3781000	We're going to the, excuse me, PlayStation 3.
3781000	3787000	Alice Madness returns there as well, as well as F.E.A.R., and the Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits.
3787000	3789000	F.E.A.R. is F.E.A.R. 3.
3789000	3790000	F.E.A.R. 3.
3790000	3792000	Well, it's F3AR.
3792000	3793000	It's that whole stylized.
3793000	3794000	I know.
3794000	3795000	It's stupid.
3795000	3796000	Like how Screen 4 had a 4 in there.
3796000	3797000	Alright, forget it.
3797000	3800000	Uh, No More Heroes, the Red Zone Edition, also on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan,
3800000	3804000	and Sniper Ghost Warrior this week as well.
3804000	3807000	Going to some of the other platforms, seeing what's coming out,
3807000	3813000	seeing if there's anything in Nintendo's world this week, be it the 3DS or what have you.
3813000	3814000	Let's see.
3814000	3820000	Well, the PSP has Grand Theft Auto games, Liberty City Stories, and Vice City Stories getting price reductions in Japan.
3820000	3824000	Also a game called Sengoku Basara Chronicle Heroes comes out this week in Japan.
3824000	3829000	That is from Capcom on the PSP, and that is, let's see,
3829000	3835000	brings back the two-on-two battles and all the famous scenes from the previous six installments.
3835000	3843000	So I guess this is a long-going series in Japan.
3843000	3849000	Try to bring out Nintendo, see what's going on in their world, if anything.
3849000	3852000	One game on the Wii this week, Everybody's Rhythm Tengoku.
3852000	3856000	So that must be Rhythm Heaven finally getting its release on the Wii in Japan this week.
3856000	3859000	So a lot of people are curious what that will look like over here.
3859000	3862000	There are a couple of big games on the 3DS this week.
3862000	3867000	Ushimitsu Monstro, Lense 2 Mahou Rhythm comes out this week in Japan.
3867000	3870000	It's like a little monster rhythm game.
3870000	3873000	I think I've seen this girl in other games before, this little character.
3873000	3874000	Which one?
3874000	3875000	I've seen her before.
3875000	3878000	It's Gabrielle's Ghostly Groove is what's coming out over here.
3878000	3879000	Thank you.
3879000	3881000	It's a 3DS version of that.
3881000	3883000	It's on WiiWare right now if you want to check.
3883000	3887000	WiiWare or DSiWare. I think WiiWare.
3887000	3892000	And then next week, Super Pokémon Scramble comes out on the 3DS.
3892000	3896000	So it's a Pokémon game even though it's not an actual Pokémon game.
3896000	3899000	It's a Pokémon mini-game thing, I guess.
3899000	3901000	It looks kind of cute, actually.
3901000	3904000	I'd check that out if it comes out over here.
3904000	3906000	There it is, your Japanese release dates.
3906000	3908000	Let's move over to the old kingdom, Dark Sakura.
3908000	3909000	Not a whole bunch.
3909000	3914000	On the 22nd, we have Calabara's The Cartel in Cars 2, the video game.
3914000	3917000	And Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.
3917000	3919000	That's it.
3919000	3921000	I'm surprised it's coming out over there as Earth Defense Force.
3921000	3924000	They used to call it Global Defense Force.
3924000	3926000	I'm gonna double check.
3926000	3928000	Yeah, it says Earth Defense Force.
3928000	3931000	Do they not like the word Earth over there or something?
3931000	3937000	Well, it was the fact that they were localizing it from Japan.
3937000	3940000	So they called it Global Defense Force over there.
3940000	3941000	Oh, I see.
3941000	3943000	It never really came out over here on PlayStation.
3943000	3945000	So it's our fault for calling it Earth Defense Force.
3945000	3948000	There were a lot of other series that were renamed just for censorship issues.
3948000	3949000	Sure.
3949000	3950000	Like Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.
3950000	3952000	Well, I'm also thinking about, you know what comes to mind,
3952000	3955000	is the whole fact that Captain America is coming out in some countries
3955000	3957000	as the first Avenger.
3957000	3960000	Like, you know, Captain America is a bad thing.
3960000	3962000	This is funny.
3962000	3964000	I know. No, I'm totally serious.
3964000	3966000	Certain countries are getting it as the first Avenger.
3966000	3967000	Hmm.
3967000	3969000	So, interesting.
3969000	3971000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.
3971000	3974000	At least they're not giving it the Hetalia treatment
3974000	3977000	where he's making, you know, he's eating cheeseburgers or something.
3977000	3979000	A couple more news stories for you guys,
3979000	3981000	then the classic game of the week.
3981000	3982000	But first, Loki.
3982000	3984000	You know, I'd be willing to see, like, you know how they have
3984000	3987000	Italian Spider-Man, Italian Captain America.
3987000	3990000	Japanese Spider-Man is freaking hilarious, by the way.
3990000	3992000	Awesome.
3992000	3996000	So, there is a new model of PlayStation 3 coming out,
3996000	3999000	actually now, I believe.
3999000	4006000	And it's to conform to a new thing that was passed back in December,
4006000	4012000	the, what was it, the AACS Final Adopter Agreement,
4012000	4018000	which basically is some sort of DRM that they have standardized
4018000	4021000	that all media companies must adhere to.
4021000	4028000	And this means that they need to only support Blu-ray playback,
4028000	4032000	high definition Blu-ray playback, only over HDMI,
4032000	4036000	because it's the only way that this kind of DRM works.
4036000	4044000	So, these new systems will be unable to play HD Blu-ray movies
4044000	4046000	over component.
4046000	4050000	It's only going to be available through HDMI.
4050000	4052000	Games are fine.
4052000	4054000	Games you can still play over component,
4054000	4061000	but you will not be able to play over component for Blu-ray.
4061000	4063000	And it's not something Sony is necessarily doing.
4063000	4065000	It's something that everybody has to do.
4065000	4070000	So, you know, if Microsoft has a new system coming out,
4070000	4073000	you know, say that supports Blu-ray later on,
4073000	4078000	they will not be able to have Blu-ray playback over component.
4078000	4079000	What are you talking about, Loki?
4079000	4082000	This is just because Sony is a bunch of cheap bastards.
4082000	4084000	That's why this is happening, because they are cheap bastards,
4084000	4088000	and they want to cut out the things that they're putting in the boxes
4088000	4089000	for the PlayStation 3.
4089000	4092000	Well, you mean cut out things that they're putting in the boxes?
4092000	4095000	That's what I read on the internet, so it must be true.
4095000	4099000	Well, that's what initially everyone thought.
4099000	4103000	Like myself, and come on, I wouldn't put it past them.
4103000	4107000	I mean, they've done things to cut out, you know,
4107000	4109000	power usage and stuff like that.
4109000	4111000	It really just saves them money on components.
4111000	4114000	So instead, you're telling me that Sony just waited until the last minute
4114000	4118000	to implement their own standard for Blu-ray?
4118000	4120000	Not even really the last minute,
4120000	4123000	because I don't think this goes into effect until 2012.
4123000	4126000	So they kind of just said, hey, you know what?
4126000	4129000	We're just going to do it now.
4129000	4131000	Before the Xmas rush.
4131000	4133000	Yeah.
4133000	4136000	But here's the thing, though, is they didn't ever explain it to anybody.
4136000	4140000	And I don't think there's anything on the box, you know, that calls out...
4140000	4142000	Well, I don't see Sony putting out a press release going,
4142000	4146000	guess what? We've taken a feature away from the PlayStation 3.
4146000	4147000	No, they don't have to say it like that.
4147000	4150000	They can just say, due to blah, blah, blah, you know,
4150000	4156000	playback of high def Blu-ray movies can only be facilitated through HDMI.
4156000	4158000	But, and then to be clear, though,
4158000	4161000	you can still hook up your PlayStation 3 through component cables.
4161000	4166000	It will only play the games and, you know, the movies in standard def, right?
4166000	4168000	Yes.
4168000	4170000	Hmm.
4170000	4173000	That sucks. My old TV didn't even have HDMI.
4173000	4175000	I had to hook up through component, and it was an HDTV.
4175000	4177000	Thankfully I do have HDMI on my TV,
4177000	4181000	and I am hooked up through HDMI for my PlayStation 3,
4181000	4186000	but once again, I mean, cause of HDMI cables are so damn cheap,
4186000	4189000	I don't understand why they don't throw one in there.
4189000	4192000	Oh wait, I know why, because they sell HDMI cables for $40,
4192000	4195000	when anybody can go out and get them for like three.
4195000	4198000	Right.
4198000	4202000	Whatever. It sucks, but that's life.
4202000	4204000	Alright, anyhow, one more story for you guys.
4204000	4206000	This has to do with a new Bimani game.
4206000	4209000	For you fans of DDR and BeatMania 2DX,
4209000	4215000	there's information about a new game that is being tested at Leisureland in Akiba, Tokyo.
4215000	4218000	It is called Sound Voltex Booth.
4218000	4220000	That's not vortex, that's voltex.
4220000	4223000	It's like volts, like energy.
4223000	4227000	There's some video that has hit the internet that shows this game in action,
4227000	4229000	and apparently kind of what this game looks like.
4229000	4231000	That's the little fuzzy music you hear in the background.
4231000	4238000	It kind of looks like, imagine like a BeatMania screen that's more like Guitar Hero, I guess, looking like that.
4238000	4240000	But it looks like not only are there buttons,
4240000	4243000	but there's some type of tilt mechanism in this game too.
4243000	4245000	Cause you'll notice as the song goes on,
4245000	4250000	the guy kind of has to drive and tilt the thing a little bit before he starts hitting buttons.
4250000	4253000	So it looks like it kind of incorporates both those features into it.
4253000	4256000	Kind of interesting.
4256000	4260000	Boy, that sounds like crap, but that's what location test videos always sound like.
4260000	4263000	So yeah, Sound Voltex is the new game on its way.
4263000	4266000	Some songs have been announced for the game,
4266000	4269000	but they're all really some, there's a Max 300 remix.
4269000	4272000	That's probably the only thing you're going to recognize by the name alone.
4272000	4278000	So yeah, more information hopefully to come soon after the location test.
4278000	4285000	So, Konami has trademarked some names, Sound Voltex Booth and Sound Voltex Floor.
4285000	4288000	Possibly localized versions of the game.
4288000	4291000	I don't know, I guess it would depend on how well this one does.
4291000	4292000	So, we'll see.
4292000	4297000	Anyhow, it's time to take a stroll down memory lane in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
4297000	4300000	Every week here at Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Sakura dives into the vault
4300000	4302000	and pulls out a classic game that she thinks,
4302000	4304000	hey, why aren't you kids playing this game?
4304000	4306000	It's awesome.
4306000	4308000	Enough with your newfangled crap.
4308000	4310000	Enjoy this old classic for a change.
4310000	4313000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4313000	4315000	It is Tekken 3.
4315000	4319000	I figured since I did Soul Blade last week, I'd do Tekken 3 this week.
4319000	4324000	Because this was my favorite fighting game for ages.
4324000	4330000	It came out in the arcade in March 1997.
4330000	4333000	And it came out on the Playstation in 1998.
4333000	4342000	There was a simplified arcade version that came out on PS2 as part of Tekken 5's arcade history mode.
4342000	4347000	But the Playstation version is probably considered one of the greatest ones ever.
4347000	4351000	It was the first game on Namco System 12 hardware.
4351000	4358000	And it was the last one that came on the original Playstation.
4358000	4360000	It is such a fun game.
4360000	4363000	This game came out when I worked for a Namco arcade.
4363000	4367000	And I played the crap out of it.
4367000	4371000	As far as the characters that were in it, it had basically,
4371000	4377000	you could unlock all of the classic characters later on.
4377000	4381000	But it had its own new characters too.
4381000	4385000	The ones that returned at the beginning were Paul Phoenix,
4385000	4389000	Nina Williams, Yoshimitsu, and Lei Wulong.
4389000	4392000	And also you could unlock Anna Williams and Heihachi.
4392000	4400000	And the new characters that came in were Jin Kazama, Shaoyu, Hwa Rang, King 2,
4400000	4407000	Eddie Gordo, who was every masher's favorite, and Forest Flaw.
4407000	4411000	And then you could also unlock Kuma and Panda,
4411000	4415000	Julia Chung, who was my second favorite person to use in the game,
4415000	4419000	Brian Fury, Gun Jack, Moco Jean, Ogre, True Ogre,
4419000	4425000	and Tiger Jackson, who was the swap for Eddie Gordo with the fro and everything.
4425000	4427000	This is the character I loved right here.
4427000	4428000	Hwa Rang.
4428000	4430000	Hwa Rang, he's awesome.
4430000	4431000	I love his music.
4431000	4435000	I'm going to turn it up a little bit.
4435000	4436000	I was actually really good with him.
4436000	4440000	My three mains that I used were him, Jin, and Julia.
4440000	4443000	And I would use Julia every time I'd play against someone who played King
4443000	4448000	because she had a really easy move to break through King's infinite combo.
4448000	4453000	So did Jin for that record, and he had an easy to do unblockable,
4453000	4455000	his little spin punch thing.
4455000	4456000	You could dodge it though.
4456000	4459000	Now, in the PlayStation version, you had two other characters.
4459000	4464000	You had Gon, who I don't know if anyone's ever heard of the comic,
4464000	4467000	and I will link something in the chat room.
4467000	4474000	Gon is a little dinosaur, and there is a manga, a big manga series.
4474000	4478000	And honestly, his ending and everything was pretty faithful.
4478000	4482000	And I could also beat, what was it, Tekken Force Mode using Gon,
4482000	4489000	which Tekken Force was like a little side-scrolling little version in the game.
4489000	4493000	He also had toxic farts.
4493000	4496000	And also Dr. Bosconovitch, who was actually supposed to be
4496000	4498000	an unlockable in the arcade version,
4498000	4506000	but he ended up being a bonus in the PlayStation version.
4506000	4510000	So there was another one that was for Blamecast,
4510000	4513000	which was a boot disk for the Dreamcast
4513000	4515000	that you could boot the PlayStation version of the game.
4515000	4519000	I've got it, and it really just enhanced the resolution.
4519000	4523000	It made it look a lot better.
4523000	4529000	But it also did sort of screw up some of the background images versus the stage,
4529000	4534000	kind of almost how it did in...
4534000	4536000	Do you remember the Japanese version of Tekken Tag Tournament,
4536000	4539000	where it would do that weird thing between the ground and the backward stage?
4539000	4545000	Where they would separate? It kind of did that number.
4545000	4551000	But this is lauded by lots of people as one of the best PlayStation games ever.
4551000	4555000	It got a 96 out of 100 on Metacritic,
4555000	4559000	and it's ranked the number 2 on their list of greatest PlayStation games.
4559000	4566000	Also, this was the music I really liked.
4566000	4569000	It was the first LoLs music. So good.
4569000	4571000	His ending was funny.
4571000	4575000	And yes, I have beaten the game, but never the win.
4575000	4578000	Now, this is actually a little bit of fun trivia.
4578000	4584000	Tekken 3 was the first game to get a 10 on EGM's revised review scale,
4584000	4587000	saying that a game no longer had to be perfect to get a 10,
4587000	4591000	and the last game that got a 10 was Sonic & Knuckles.
4591000	4597000	So it honestly is one of my favorites.
4597000	4602000	I have to say it is a masher's paradise, especially with Eddie Gordo.
4602000	4606000	Yeah, I loved him. That was awesome.
4606000	4610000	See, I would only use him to play Tiger, because Tiger was so freaking hilarious.
4610000	4613000	But the game had great music.
4613000	4616000	And I'll tell you one thing, actually, and this is actually fairly common with me
4616000	4619000	and the Namco games when they bring them home
4619000	4622000	and have their arranged version of the soundtrack.
4622000	4627000	I always preferred the arcade soundtrack, except for a couple of cases in Soul Calibur.
4627000	4632000	Not Soul Calibur, but Soul Blade, because I like Cervantes' arranged music better.
4632000	4637000	But it had fantastic music. It had fantastic graphics for its time.
4637000	4641000	Fantastic moves. I mean, it looked gorgeous.
4641000	4645000	And it was funny. My boss at Aladdin's Castle
4645000	4649000	I worked at Aladdin's Castle in Mobile, Alabama. I will not hide this at all.
4649000	4653000	My boss, Anthony, he's a great guy.
4653000	4657000	But I would always watch the Japanese forums to see who was going to be the next character to come out.
4657000	4661000	And they actually had a different release schedule
4661000	4664000	for the US machines versus the Japanese machines.
4664000	4668000	So I would sometimes be able to guess, because they had this little screen pop up that says
4668000	4671000	guess who or who's next or something.
4671000	4675000	And I would usually be able to accurately say who was the next character coming out.
4675000	4679000	So it was pretty neat.
4679000	4683000	I would just play the crap out of these games. But I remember, and now this is
4683000	4687000	this game sparked a conversation that we had one time while I was working
4687000	4693000	about how realistic are we going to see graphics become in the future.
4693000	4697000	And he called it that day.
4697000	4701000	You know, after a while arcades aren't going to be relevant anymore.
4701000	4705000	That you're going to be able to get that degree of quality at home.
4705000	4709000	Whoops.
4709000	4713000	And we were talking about just seeing how far it could go and I said
4713000	4717000	there's going to come a day where you're not going to be able to tell the 3D from the real thing.
4717000	4721000	And now they've even got different types of motion capture so in advance
4721000	4725000	that you really can't tell the difference unless you're really looking for it.
4725000	4729000	But as far as this
4729000	4733000	it is, I think to this day, my favorite Tekken game.
4733000	4737000	I mean I really loved Tekken 4.
4737000	4741000	I was still pissed off about what was that game, that company
4741000	4745000	that I gave the Better Business Bureau review to.
4745000	4749000	Because they sent me the Asian version and not the Japanese version
4749000	4753000	of that specifically as to the Japanese version.
4753000	4757000	Was it Toys and Joy?
4757000	4761000	It wasn't Toys and Joy. Toys and Joy has always been good.
4761000	4765000	It was like import something.
4765000	4769000	They're long since out of business.
4769000	4773000	The other good thing about this one is that it had a mode called Tekken Force.
4773000	4777000	Which was a kind of side scrolling version.
4777000	4781000	A beat em up like Streets of Rage.
4781000	4785000	You go through different stages and if you beat
4785000	4789000	the mini game 4 times then you could unlock Dr. Bosconovitch.
4789000	4793000	You had to beat him first of course.
4793000	4797000	It had another version that was called Tekken Ball that was like
4797000	4801000	beach volleyball. Except you had to charge the ball so you had to use
4801000	4805000	a powerful attack to try to hurt your opponent or hit the ball
4805000	4809000	so that it hits the ground. And then your character would get injured
4809000	4813000	if it touched the ground. Or the opponent's character would get injured if it touched the ground.
4813000	4817000	And it was just awesome.
4817000	4821000	It was super fun. So you can still find it.
4821000	4825000	If you get Tekken 5 it's in the history mode so there you go.
4825000	4829000	One of the best games ever.
4829000	4833000	Alright there it is. Tekken 3.
4833000	4837000	Yeah because I like this character. The other one ran out.
4837000	4841000	The PlayStation version. This is what Namco was doing. Look how we can render
4841000	4845000	individual hairs. And it looks so unnatural.
4845000	4849000	Oh geez.
4849000	4853000	Alright well that's going to do it for the classic game of the week. But don't go anywhere
4853000	4857000	because Orange Laundry is going to be right back with part B of our show tonight. We have some rapid fire
4857000	4861000	news for you guys. Some news about PopCap got sold. We got to talk about that one.
4861000	4865000	Talk about some news around EA's camp when it comes to server shutdowns.
4865000	4869000	And some discussion topics tonight. You know tonight
4869000	4873000	the news is a little bit light. But we're going to talk about is Good Parenting
4873000	4877000	better than a violent video game ban. I'm sure that will get everybody riled
4877000	4881000	up here in studio. And stop hating on sports games
4881000	4885000	says one writer. We're going to talk about all that when we come back with more tonight of Orange Lounge
4885000	4889000	Radio.
4889000	4893000	Welcome back everybody to
4893000	4897000	Orange Lounge Radio. The show where every gamer has a voice. We are back with
4897000	4901000	this part B of our episode number 420.
4901000	4905000	I'll just let that be. On this July 17th of
4905000	4909000	2011. So we're going to get back into some gaming
4909000	4913000	news including rapid fire news as well as your tweets. So this is your last
4913000	4917000	chance to get in those Twitter topics. Twitter.com slash o-l-r.
4917000	4921000	But first I want to just give a quick plug for other projects and things that we're working on.
4921000	4925000	Of course the best little Hoard House in Azeroth is a Warcraft podcast
4925000	4929000	that I host with my buddy Ecstifer. For more information you can visit
4929000	4933000	www.hoardhouse.com. Sadly there wasn't a new show this week because there was
4933000	4937000	some other stuff going on. But we should be back next week. And so this would be a great time to catch up on
4937000	4941000	the what 31 some odd back episodes there are of the show.
4941000	4945000	And listen to our potty humor in talking about Warcraft. But never too
4945000	4949000	seriously. I have a new impression by the way. What's that? What is nature's call?
4949000	4953000	I get sick of hearing it every time. Is that
4953000	4957000	one of the chicks in Warcraft when you get a quest? Arela?
4957000	4961000	The centaur girl? Uh huh uh huh. Ah the great
4961000	4965000	outdoors. Yeah yeah I know exactly who you're talking about. Screw her.
4965000	4969000	Anyhow. How? Very carefully. You just got to get
4969000	4973000	those hindl- never mind. Anyway. Also I want to plug guest appearance I did
4973000	4977000	this week on Undersedation Live. Of course it was their 10th anniversary show. I talked about that
4977000	4981000	at the top of the program. But fun. And a lot of the chatters were saying it was a very different side
4981000	4985000	of me. It was on that show. And I'm just saying well. It's not really about
4985000	4989000	games. It was the old Rob. I don't have to. It was still me.
4989000	4993000	I didn't like go in there with a different mindset. It's just I don't have to worry about. It's not my show
4993000	4997000	quote unquote anymore. You're different when you're not facilitating. Yeah I'm not facilitating. I'm not in the
4997000	5001000	MC role. And plus I realized on that show conversation will go anywhere
5001000	5005000	and anywhere. This show I've got to make sure after a 20 minute tangent it does get back to
5005000	5009000	the games eventually. But that show. Pshh. We should talk about whatever.
5009000	5013000	I was in the same boat when I was running the gig you know when Tiara
5013000	5017000	guested. Right right. So it's just a different role.
5017000	5021000	When you have to be moderator. It's just like Julie Chen on Big Brother
5021000	5025000	versus Julie Chen on The Talk. For those that actually watch daytime TV.
5025000	5029000	I had a Metal Gear style question mark pop up over my head just now.
5029000	5033000	Okay did you see the clip of the person that cried on the news
5033000	5037000	when they had to read the verdict that Casey Anthony was innocent. That was Julie Chen.
5037000	5041000	But if you see her on Big Brother they call her Chenbot because she's like a robot every episode.
5041000	5045000	But first. This is very very robotic.
5045000	5049000	But then she like cried so it was a big deal on the other show. Anyway.
5049000	5053000	Because they discovered robots have emotion now? Yes apparently. She got her emotion
5053000	5057000	chip put in. She can learn. Dark Soccer I don't know if you
5057000	5061000	can plug the stuff you've been guessing on. Uh oh.
5061000	5065000	Actually the podcast that Tiara and our
5065000	5069000	friend Weasel do for Geek Life is called Pop Culture
5069000	5073000	Parlay. If you go to geek-life.com I am going
5073000	5077000	to be on the next two episodes. So yay.
5077000	5081000	Awesome. And it was a very interesting discussion and there
5081000	5085000	was some pyramid head mentioned. I'll leave it
5085000	5089000	at that. Great. So by the way it sounds like I didn't even realize
5089000	5093000	this but the chat room is telling me my audio cut out for a little bit there. I don't know if that's the mic or whatever.
5093000	5097000	But there was audio issues so. Can you hear me now chat room bah bah
5097000	5101000	bah bah. It's not you I think it was me. Oh. I don't know what's going on.
5101000	5105000	Rob was talking about how he likes to do things.
5105000	5109000	How sad I'm giving the plug for Undersedation Live and it cut
5109000	5113000	out. So I don't. Rob was on Undersedation Live guys and it was epic. Exactly yeah
5113000	5117000	there you go. Listen to Hoard House. Listen to Undersedation Live.
5117000	5121000	And there was diarrhea involved. Let's not. Alright.
5121000	5125000	Let's instead. Should I go check on your coffee.
5125000	5129000	I don't know if that's a good thing to bring up right after that.
5129000	5133000	Alright can we move on please with some rapid fire news going
5133000	5137000	to and by the way Brad from Pod Culture
5137000	5141000	in the chat room says big difference between innocent and not guilty.
5141000	5145000	I don't want to get too political on this program or what have you or
5145000	5149000	talk about controversial stuff because you know I'll let what's her name
5149000	5153000	oh god what's that chick on the CNN show that
5153000	5157000	oh god Nancy Grace that's that I'll leave that discussion
5157000	5161000	to her but fine I stand corrected on my earlier comment.
5161000	5165000	Let's get to some rapid fire news though. Loki why don't you start us. Alright.
5165000	5169000	Well there is a rumor that apparently during Comic Con
5169000	5173000	they're going to announce a new Marvel vs. Capcom
5173000	5177000	kind of iteration I guess or Marvel vs. Capcom 3
5177000	5181000	to be exact the actual announcement is supposed to be
5181000	5185000	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and it's supposed to include
5185000	5189000	a roster update including I think 12
5189000	5193000	extra characters are supposed to be added to the roster and it
5193000	5197000	will supposed to be I guess sold for $40
5197000	5201000	retail and some of the rumored characters
5201000	5205000	of course doctor Doc Doc because
5205000	5209000	I guess there are some files that kind of referenced him in
5209000	5213000	the ISO that was floating around out there but apparently
5213000	5217000	there is a panel for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at Comic Con so it makes
5217000	5221000	sense that they would maybe make an announcement. Maybe they just want to
5221000	5225000	give out tips. Okay maybe not.
5225000	5229000	It's hard to believe that it wasn't that long ago that the game came out
5229000	5233000	I mean February. Well Street Fighter 4 and
5233000	5237000	Super Street Fighter 4 kind of the same thing happened.
5237000	5241000	12 characters is a lot though. I mean that would be kind of cool.
5241000	5245000	Some other fun stuff. Apparently
5245000	5249000	the Super Mario Brothers movie could have been a lot better
5249000	5253000	and some of the earlier drafts I guess of the script actually had it
5253000	5257000	a little bit more traditional to the actual Mario Brothers game.
5257000	5261000	There was actually supposed to be some sort of epic boss fight
5261000	5265000	over lava and stuff with Koopa and a lot of
5265000	5269000	like you know the scenery that you would see
5269000	5273000	in the game will actually kind of take place in the movie. Also I guess Koopa
5273000	5277000	was flying around in a giant floating pirate ship. But
5277000	5281000	unfortunately what we got ended up being some sort of
5281000	5285000	weird Mario
5285000	5289000	Judge Dredd movie. Wait a minute. You mean that executives came in
5289000	5293000	and fucked the whole thing up because they thought they knew what people wanted?
5293000	5297000	Aw I've never heard of this happening before. Not anywhere.
5297000	5301000	Yeah yeah I know. It's weird.
5301000	5305000	But that's what they did.
5305000	5309000	And then finally I guess this is kind of funny. They actually had a
5309000	5313000	dig at Capcom in
5313000	5317000	Splosion Man. And it's during one of the levels
5317000	5321000	that looks very much like the star road in
5321000	5325000	Super Mario World. And they're all, who does this? I mean
5325000	5329000	this is completely ripped off. What is this a Capcom game or
5329000	5333000	something? So it's funny. Nice.
5333000	5337000	Alright going to some other quick stories here. There's an epic
5337000	5341000	mod on its way out for Starcraft. It's called Starcraft Universe.
5341000	5345000	You might have known this previously as World of Starcraft. But then there was
5345000	5349000	the whole throw down between the creator and Blizzard.
5349000	5353000	Which ended actually pretty cool. I believe they invited the dude to hang out at Blizzard headquarters.
5353000	5357000	Like hey hey look we're not trying to be dicks but we have to protect our IP.
5357000	5361000	You know kind of extending the olive branch. Well this was all back in
5361000	5365000	January when that whole thing happened. But now there is a trailer out with
5365000	5369000	gameplay from the alpha version. So I guess in a
5369000	5373000	press release that the dude sent to Kotaku he wanted to update everybody on
5373000	5377000	the mod's progress. So yeah kind of interesting that it's going.
5377000	5381000	Let me play a little bit of that trailer here in studio so folks can see who that is.
5381000	5385000	I mean this looks like an epic mod for Starcraft.
5385000	5389000	There's some cinematics there. I want to see if we can get some gameplay. Like when you look at the gameplay it really does
5389000	5393000	kind of look like World of Warcraft but in the Starcraft universe.
5393000	5397000	Which is kind of cool. Complete with like the
5397000	5401000	hit points for numbers and the whole kind of first person-esque
5401000	5405000	3D environments. With the mini map
5405000	5409000	in the corner. I mean this feels very fluid the interface to somebody who's familiar with World of Warcraft.
5409000	5413000	I'm very surprised that Blizzard is not going to charge for this separate game.
5413000	5417000	Or somehow work that out with the creator. So I'm not sure exactly
5417000	5421000	how that's going down. But maybe there's going to be more about that
5421000	5425000	at Blizzcon. I want to try that. Now the creator of this actually
5425000	5429000	left school to work on Starcraft universe for full time.
5429000	5433000	He says at this point I'm learning way more creating Starcraft universe
5433000	5437000	than I ever would at school. Most of my friends trying to get into creative
5437000	5441000	industry find themselves having to grind out a massive portfolio to find any
5441000	5445000	work after four years of college. This is very true.
5445000	5449000	Wow that's crazy.
5449000	5453000	Blizzard would be dumb not to hire him if this ends up being a pretty awesome
5453000	5457000	thing here. So we'll have to see.
5457000	5461000	We'll have to see how that works out. Also other
5461000	5465000	new stories. Incubus, you know the band, they're getting their
5465000	5469000	own video game. It's called Incubattle.
5469000	5473000	It's a beat-em-up that's very similar to Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
5473000	5477000	in that whole retro style. It's, you know what that reminds me of? Actually more so
5477000	5481000	than that. Remember the Linkin Park game that they put out in like IOS or something?
5481000	5485000	Yeah. It's very much like that. There you go. Well you can pick one of the band's
5485000	5489000	five members and you go on the streets and fight. Who do you fight?
5489000	5493000	Pirates trying to steal the band's latest album.
5493000	5497000	Seriously? That is seriously who you're fighting.
5497000	5501000	That's awesome. No indication on what
5501000	5505000	you can click on. Is this a flash game or something? I don't know.
5505000	5509000	Yeah it looks like a little flash game we can actually play there.
5509000	5513000	I'm not going to play that. I'm going to go cause physical harm
5513000	5517000	to pirates because they do physical harm to my wall. Well if they have the whole hats
5517000	5521000	in the eye patch, that's actually kind of awesome.
5521000	5525000	Anyhow, Arkham City's collector's edition
5525000	5529000	has announced some pre-orders. GameStop and Best Buy both priced
5529000	5533000	the collector's edition. Let's see, Best Buy actually went ahead and
5533000	5537000	priced the collection at $99.99 and
5537000	5541000	explained the content saying a premium statue, an art
5541000	5545000	book, Gotham Knight animated material, and interestingly enough
5545000	5549000	early access to download content. It all comes out on October
5549000	5553000	18th when the game is set to come out. There you go. Pretty cool.
5553000	5557000	Did you hear about that Incubus game, Dark Sakura? Yeah I did. The one you can kind of play in the browser?
5557000	5561000	Yeah. Is that something you'd check out? I was crying in the other room. What do you think about
5561000	5565000	fighting pirates? If I wanted to fight pirates
5565000	5569000	I would just fight the blood-sail buccaneers.
5569000	5573000	Alright, there you go. By the way, we actually have
5573000	5577000	a new Incubus single apparently has released to promote
5577000	5581000	the new game. Who would have known that this is coming out, but here you go. Let's take a
5581000	5585000	little listen here.
5585000	5613000	But I just wanted to make one copy.
5613000	5617000	There you go. Don't Copy That Floppy, the hot new Incubus single
5617000	5621000	that's going to be in that game. It's great. As you fight the pirates.
5621000	5625000	Is that interesting new sound for them? Yeah.
5625000	5629000	Well, here's some good news. For Sonic Generations
5629000	5633000	guess who's going to be there? Metal Sonic! And it's going to be
5633000	5637000	old school Metal Sonic and he's going to be one of the rivals.
5637000	5641000	I freaking love Mecha Sonic so that's really cool. That was
5641000	5645000	actually my favorite part of Sonic CD.
5645000	5649000	And then Konami. Yes, Konami again.
5649000	5653000	They're giving us a choice. It's actually up on
5653000	5657000	Xbox Live Arcade and PSN where
5657000	5661000	they're going to let basically the people
5661000	5665000	who subscribe to these services choose the next game. It's on their Facebook
5665000	5669000	page so there's a question there. In a perfect world what previously released
5669000	5673000	Konami Classic would you like to see next on the Xbox Live Arcade or PSN?
5673000	5677000	Simpsons Arcade Game. Yes. No, I want YY Konami World.
5677000	5681000	And then last but not least Child of Eden is going to be
5681000	5685000	on Playstation 3 on September 23rd.
5685000	5689000	And it's basically
5689000	5693000	going to also have revised
5693000	5697000	versions I believe. There's the
5697000	5701000	there's some other games I want to say. There's Call of
5701000	5705000	War as the Cartel on the 16th of September World Rally Championship
5705000	5709000	2011 on October 7th and Connect to Party
5709000	5713000	Rabbids Live and Kicking on 360
5713000	5717000	in November. Also Far Cry 3 and Brothers in Arms Furious 4
5717000	5721000	are going to be on 2012. The end.
5721000	5725000	Alright. Let's get to Twitter topics tonight. Every week we invite
5725000	5729000	your tweets at Twitter.com slash OLR because after all
5729000	5733000	it is the show where every gamer has a voice. Sometimes you want to ask questions or you want to
5733000	5737000	make sure we touch on a story at some point during this show or you just have an opinion
5737000	5741000	you want to share. We read your feedback in 120 or excuse me 140
5741000	5745000	characters or less. Ramaditya Knight tweets us
5745000	5749000	saying what is your favorite NES multi-cart?
5749000	5753000	Mine is Supervision 110 in 1 and Super
5753000	5757000	190 in 1. Oh god. Most of those multi-cart games were utter garbage.
5757000	5761000	Do you have a favorite multi-cart Dark Sakura?
5761000	5765000	Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt. Oh you stole the answer
5765000	5769000	I was thinking Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt. Actually maybe Tetris
5769000	5773000	Duck Mario. That was a good one too. I was thinking Donkey Kong Jr. and Donkey Kong.
5773000	5777000	Loki? I really wish I had
5777000	5781000	played more of those pirated multi-carts because they had
5781000	5785000	some with like Final Fantasy 7
5785000	5789000	and the Titanic game. Oh god
5789000	5793000	yeah there's some amazing garbage in those carts. Well Ramaditya Knight
5793000	5797000	gives you some ideas there. Supervision 110 in 1 and
5797000	5801000	Super 190 in 1. My favorite multi-cart?
5801000	5805000	Short Order and Eggsplode. They were power pad games. Anyone ever play those?
5805000	5809000	It was awesome. One of them was whack-a-mole with your feet. That was Eggsplode.
5809000	5813000	Anyway. Moving on. More tweets.
5813000	5817000	Let's see.
5817000	5821000	Matt on Twitter tweets us and says
5821000	5825000	Hey Toys R Us is having a $15 sale on all Tony Hawk
5825000	5829000	and DJ Guitar Hero bundles. Wow. That's a great deal.
5829000	5833000	$15. That's an awesome deal. Like if you don't own DJ Hero
5833000	5837000	you might want to like consider that. Actually shit I would love to just pick up an
5837000	5841000	extra guitar controller to be honest. Guitar Hero bundles? Hold on
5841000	5845000	I'm going to the source here. He's linking us to a thread on CheapAssGamer
5845000	5849000	It works on the bundles but not the super
5849000	5853000	combo bundles. For Guitar Hero on tour. Oh yeah super combos would be ridiculous.
5853000	5857000	Guitar Hero 5 and Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock. Holy crap.
5857000	5861000	Yeah the super bundles I mean those are basically like you know
5861000	5865000	all the instruments. That. I might have to do that. That's a pretty
5865000	5869000	damn good deal. I can't tell you this much. We had. We were clearing out some old inventory.
5869000	5873000	We had $50. It could buy you the DJ Hero
5873000	5877000	party set. Our DJ Hero 2 party set on the Wii.
5877000	5881000	Two turntables and a microphone at a game for $50.
5881000	5885000	Is that where it's at? If I played on the Wii man that's an awesome deal.
5885000	5889000	Alright. Moving on. Tiger Claw tweets
5889000	5893000	us a few things. One is a story about how Steam apparently has
5893000	5897000	improved its content delivery system. Defense of the Ancients 2
5897000	5901000	will be making use of the new system when it comes out soon.
5901000	5905000	But apparently yeah it has to do with the fact that when new games come out on launch day
5905000	5909000	from Steam sometimes the system kind of buckles under the pressure.
5909000	5913000	Those big sales too. The last day of that summer camp sale was pretty bad as well. Like remember
5913000	5917000	Dark Soccer when I sent you the copy of the Terraria? Like you couldn't even get it at first.
5917000	5921000	It was kind of crap. Well Valve is trying to improve the system
5921000	5925000	especially for games that are in high demand and improve download speeds worldwide which is
5925000	5929000	awesome. For those that have ISPs with monthly
5929000	5933000	bandwidth caps Steam will no longer force you to download
5933000	5937000	unnecessary data when a game is updated. You will just download
5937000	5941000	whatever has been changed rather than the entire files. Can't believe they weren't doing
5941000	5945000	this before but that's a great improvement. Help cut back on some of the bandwidth
5945000	5949000	overall. And you can also get into download
5949000	5953000	scheduling, bandwidth throttling, and the ability to prioritize
5953000	5957000	the order that games are downloaded for updates and so forth. That's all coming
5957000	5961000	to Steam very soon. Now not everything on Steam will be able to use this right
5961000	5965000	away but Dota will be the first game to use it when it comes
5965000	5969000	out soon. Very interesting that they're pegging that as a game to use it
5969000	5973000	soon. I had no idea this game was going to be coming out sooner rather than later.
5973000	5977000	I hope that's a good sign and not something I'm just misunderstanding there.
5977000	5981000	So, hmm, very interesting. One other story coming to us from
5981000	5985000	Tigerclaw on Twitter and it has to do with Hideo Kojima
5985000	5989000	and he says, you know what, I don't have time for a new Snatcher game.
5989000	5993000	But if someone else wants to do it, great. So it might be kind of opening the
5993000	5997000	door there to a new Snatcher game. It was in an interview with PlayStation
5997000	6001000	blog when he was asked about games like L.A. Noire and Deus Ex Human Revolution.
6001000	6005000	Do you want to make a new Snatcher game? Kojima said, quote, L.A. Noire is a game
6005000	6009000	that I really like but unfortunately I have not played it.
6009000	6013000	I think it is coming out in Japan today so when I return I intend
6013000	6017000	to play it. The idea of an open world in 3D is very good and I would love to do something
6017000	6021000	like Snatcher but I do not have the time or the means to do so.
6021000	6025000	But if anyone else would like to develop it, I would love it.
6025000	6029000	So Team Bondi, you might need to give Hideo Kojima a call.
6029000	6033000	You might not even have to work 100 hour work weeks to get that game done. Who knows.
6033000	6037000	Anyhow, that is going to do it for Twitter topics tonight. Twitter.com slash olr
6037000	6041000	if you want to get your tweets in for next week. In the meantime, back to gaming news.
6041000	6045000	Your phone calls in about 30 minutes here on OLR. The mailbag is coming up soon as well.
6045000	6049000	FUs of the Week and all that stuff you love. Loki.
6049000	6053000	Yes, this is kind of neat. EA bought PopCap.
6053000	6057000	I mean, thank god it wasn't Zynga.
6057000	6061000	Which they were in the running by the way. EA purchased
6061000	6065000	PopCap games for 750 million dollars.
6065000	6069000	And then also of course there's some bonuses including
6069000	6073000	some performance bonuses I guess.
6073000	6077000	They're worth another, I want to say 250 million or maybe
6077000	6081000	a little bit more than that. Maybe it's 500 million.
6081000	6085000	But PopCap was actually
6085000	6089000	going to be, I guess Zynga had put in an offer for
6089000	6093000	a billion dollars and they got turned down. Which is good.
6093000	6097000	Good job PopCap. Thank god. Although I don't know
6097000	6101000	why did they have to sell? Why were they so intent on selling?
6101000	6105000	Wasn't PopCap doing great on their own? I kind of worry about this
6105000	6109000	relationship with EA. I mean, as long as PopCap's allowed to do their own thing
6109000	6113000	then cool. But I got to admit, doing the show that I do on World of Warcraft
6113000	6117000	it's becoming glaringly obvious that every bad thing that's happened
6117000	6121000	in WoW is because of Activision now owning a stake in Blizzard. And I just
6121000	6125000	I worry about this. Also speaking of WoW, it's upsetting that
6125000	6129000	we'll never see any more of the free pay goal and free
6129000	6133000	bejeweled mods that you have in WoW.
6133000	6137000	That sucks because it's a competition with the Old Republic
6137000	6141000	and some of the stuff that EA's doing. But I don't
6141000	6145000	know. I mean, was PopCap really so
6145000	6149000	hard up for money that they had to sell?
6149000	6153000	We wouldn't really know without looking at their portfolio though. Yeah, but PopCap
6153000	6157000	their games are on every fucking system known to man. That's part of the charm
6157000	6161000	of PopCap. Plants vs. Zombies. Name me one thing you can't
6161000	6165000	play Plants vs. Zombies on. Let's see. Maybe an old
6165000	6169000	Nokia phone and an Atari 2600. That's probably it.
6169000	6173000	I would bet somebody's probably tried to port it to the 2600.
6173000	6177000	So, you know, I just...
6177000	6181000	Actually, yeah, you can play that in WoW because there's a quest. Yeah, Peace Bloom vs. Ghouls.
6181000	6185000	I have my Peace Bloom. They'll remove that quest from WoW, watch.
6185000	6189000	I'm keeping my Peace Bloom. You better not take my Peace Bloom.
6189000	6193000	I don't think they will. I love my stupid singing flower. I actually hate
6193000	6197000	those fucking flowers that sing because you'll be walking through Stormwind
6197000	6201000	and it's like, shut the fuck up.
6201000	6205000	I want a torch to set those things on fire, but anyway.
6205000	6209000	Why couldn't they give us one of the plants to look like Audrey?
6209000	6213000	I want a zombie to eat that plant. Anyway, I digress.
6213000	6217000	I guess if it's a good business thing for PopCap then yay winners, but you know
6217000	6221000	there's always going to be that part of me that's a little bit nervous. A little bit nervous about what the future
6221000	6225000	has. Break room in our chat room
6225000	6229000	at chat.orangelaungeradio.com. If Zynga bought PopCap games
6229000	6233000	I would still be crying. Tigerclaw says, you know
6233000	6237000	EA is going to be milking those PopCap games. Tigerclaw says
6237000	6241000	Pagel Battlefield. I don't know if it'll get that bad.
6241000	6245000	I think EA just kind of wants something to fall back on if they're games.
6245000	6249000	It's not like EA doesn't have a humongous library of games.
6249000	6253000	But it's nice to have some proven
6253000	6257000	winners in their hat. And that would maybe be the best news
6257000	6261000	out of all with this is that if EA knows they've got a winner in their back pocket
6261000	6265000	then maybe they'll experiment with some new stuff on the other hand.
6265000	6269000	I mean I'm sure that's just wishful thinking on my part but
6269000	6273000	forgive me for being a dreamer.
6273000	6277000	People say you're a dreamer but you're not the only one. I'm not the only one exactly.
6277000	6281000	So there you go. Moving on
6281000	6285000	this is another story that's kind of about Zynga and it's about EA. It's interesting how these things
6285000	6289000	come full circle. This is about the NBA Jam creator
6289000	6293000	Mark Turmel. He created the NBA Jam series that recently
6293000	6297000	came back last year although it kind of came back with a pfft.
6297000	6301000	Hopefully the arcade ones this year will be a little better. He has left EA Sports.
6301000	6305000	You know where he works now? Zynga. Yeah.
6305000	6309000	So he now works at Zynga. So who knows what
6309000	6313000	he's going to create for them over there. He was assimilated into their collective.
6313000	6317000	He was the senior creative director at EA when he left.
6317000	6321000	NBA Jam is not the only thing he works on but you know some other projects as well.
6321000	6325000	Apparently there were rumors about a return of NFL Blitz
6325000	6329000	when this guy worked at Midway and then EA bought the
6329000	6333000	Blitz property when Midway was going out of business but
6333000	6337000	I don't know if that will happen now or maybe it will just happen without this guy overseeing the project
6337000	6341000	anymore. EA has confirmed his departure. No word
6341000	6345000	what exactly he's going to help design at Zynga. I don't know.
6345000	6349000	I'm really trying to look at both sides about Zynga but does anyone
6349000	6353000	else think Zynga's days are really numbered? And it's not just about the whole
6353000	6357000	fact that their games are laughably bad when it comes to things like
6357000	6361000	Farmville and so forth despite the fact that tons and tons of people play them.
6361000	6365000	But I feel like if Facebook goes down, Zynga
6365000	6369000	is fucked. Zynga has yet to establish. I mean I know they like
6369000	6373000	to say in their press releases, well people could just come to Zynga.com and play.
6373000	6377000	No one's going to do it. You're not going to be nearly the company you are thanks
6377000	6381000	to Facebook. What if Google Plus rolls out games and says
6381000	6385000	you know what? Since we don't like the Zynga games ever either
6385000	6389000	and we've become this safe haven for nerds, we're not going to partner with Zynga.
6389000	6393000	Zynga's not allowed to put their games on Facebook or on Google Plus
6393000	6397000	excuse me. Or maybe Google Plus will come out and say sure we're going to have games but it's not
6397000	6401000	showing up in the stream or it's not going to do the same thing that Facebook did
6401000	6405000	where it shows up in feeds. It'll be like how I think how Yahoo
6405000	6409000	games were. It was just its own section.
6409000	6413000	So you can go to that. Yeah it'll be how most people I think would prefer to see it.
6413000	6417000	Don't keep it off my stream. But you can have some cool games in their own little
6417000	6421000	games section. I played Lexulus for the longest time.
6421000	6425000	It's going to be very interesting. And that's why I'm also glad to see
6425000	6429000	PopCap didn't go with Zynga. Although for Zynga's benefit, that would have been a huge
6429000	6433000	win for them because at least PopCap can prove that they've done a bunch of other stuff
6433000	6437000	in the other place. So there's at least that.
6437000	6441000	Alright, so let's move on with another story. Dark Soccer, what do you
6441000	6445000	got for us? Well, what I have is actually
6445000	6449000	a little bit more death.
6449000	6453000	How's that?
6453000	6457000	EA is going to be doing another
6457000	6461000	bit of online service shutdowns, taking down a bunch
6461000	6465000	of multiplayer games and demos.
6465000	6469000	Army of Two, bye.
6469000	6473000	The demo, bye. Battlefield 2142, bye.
6473000	6477000	Battlefield 2 Modern Combat, demo, Medal of Honor
6477000	6481000	Heroes 2, NASCAR 09,
6481000	6485000	NCAA Basketball 10, NCAA Football 10,
6485000	6489000	Need for Speed Most Wanted, Need for Speed Undercover, Skate for Playstation 3,
6489000	6493000	Xbox 360, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10, and 11.
6493000	6497000	Those are all going down on August 11th. And on October 1st, Madden NFL 10
6497000	6501000	and NHL 10, bye.
6501000	6505000	Sucks to be the guy that paid $10 to play those games online yesterday.
6505000	6509000	I know, bye. I'm just kidding, obviously those games were out
6509000	6513000	well before the whole $10 thing took off, but
6513000	6517000	can't wait to see when the inevitable next wave of server shutdowns comes out and
6517000	6521000	something that you paid $10 because you bought it used a couple years after the fact to play online
6521000	6525000	suddenly shuts down. I know. That'll go over real well. I mean at least
6525000	6529000	most of those games are like old sequels, you know what I mean? Like they're
6529000	6533000	old games in series that have newer sequels. And they probably have a good
6533000	6537000	point. No one's playing those games online anymore. So they're not
6537000	6541000	exactly, people are going to cry over them, but it's going to be very interesting
6541000	6545000	when we get to the $10 games. Here you go.
6545000	6549000	Alright. Loki, what do you have for us?
6549000	6553000	Ah yes. I mean
6553000	6557000	I hate when they shut down stuff. This is kind of cool.
6557000	6561000	Now I haven't really ever played this in the arcade, but I'm definitely familiar with the music.
6561000	6565000	Wagon Midnight Maximum Tune is coming to arcades
6565000	6569000	number four that is, in December in Japan.
6569000	6573000	And I'm assuming we can expect more of
6573000	6577000	the wonderful music in there. Some of the stuff that they
6577000	6581000	are going to be, I guess adding, connected ghost
6581000	6585000	battle mode. So you'll be able to battle ghost records around the world.
6585000	6589000	And you can challenge the top ghosts in the world.
6589000	6593000	Let's see. They're also going to have a team function. You can create your own teams. Put team specific
6593000	6597000	stickers on your cars. And I'm not sure if that's
6597000	6601000	going to make the international version. New cars including the Mazda RX7.
6601000	6605000	The Mitsubishi Starion. Nissan Skyline
6605000	6609000	Coupe V36. And the Infiniti G37
6609000	6613000	Coupe. The REF CTR Yellowbird. The REF
6613000	6617000	RGT. Subaru Legacy B4 fifth generation.
6617000	6621000	The Toyota Crown thirteenth generation. And
6621000	6625000	yet unannounced car. Also some new courses.
6625000	6629000	Yokohama Line and Yaesu Route.
6629000	6633000	Both part of the Shudo Expressway.
6633000	6637000	And they're also going to have some new parts. 22 new dress up parts.
6637000	6641000	Yay dress up!
6641000	6645000	And then power up. They're going to have maximum power now.
6645000	6649000	130 horsepower. So that's kind of
6649000	6653000	cool. I mean I don't know. I know that there's definitely
6653000	6657000	in the arcade scene nowadays it's all about racing games.
6657000	6661000	I mean that's really popular. So it'll be kind of cool. Hopefully this stuff makes it
6661000	6665000	over here. Yeah it'll be nice. As I was saying at the top of the show
6665000	6669000	that's a pretty awesome racing series. So I do hope we see that show up
6669000	6673000	over here. Alright well I'm curious to see what the OLR hosts
6673000	6677000	think of this next story. And I'm sure a lot of you guys are probably going to be on the same side as this guy.
6677000	6681000	But I think this guy puts it pretty well. This comes from Charles
6681000	6685000	Smith who is a professor of family studies for Kansas State University.
6685000	6689000	He says that there's this big hysteria
6689000	6693000	about violence in video games. But it's context and the type of game that's
6693000	6697000	important. The type of child is important as well. Here's a quote.
6697000	6701000	Quote, a child without a connected parent relationship. One who doesn't have
6701000	6705000	respect for their parents and plays a violent video game over a certain length of time
6705000	6709000	would worry me. But banning video games completely isn't the right
6709000	6713000	answer either. He goes on to say that banning games
6713000	6717000	might make them more attractive to children. Quote,
6717000	6721000	the realism in video games is changing constantly because of technology.
6721000	6725000	This causes more realistic violence and video games are becoming more and more
6725000	6729000	immersive in terms of their nature. And he's talking about how you know
6729000	6733000	the technology is always changing and this can kind of be a concern. But ultimately
6733000	6737000	at the end of the day, he says that parents, they need to be educated. They need to be aware
6737000	6741000	about what games they're letting their children play. Without that parent-child
6741000	6745000	relationship, children can go play whatever video games they want
6745000	6749000	without that relationship.
6749000	6753000	But with it, kids can play those games and not turn out
6753000	6757000	violent because the parents are still there to teach them right from wrong. And I say, well
6757000	6761000	said, Professor Smith. Well said. And I'm sure most people here
6761000	6765000	in the studio think the same way. Well said.
6765000	6769000	Too bad he's not the one. I say elect him for office.
6769000	6773000	He knows what he's talking about. We need him to go
6773000	6777000	against Leland Yee in what is
6777000	6781000	needed for kids and so forth.
6781000	6785000	Alright. Let's move on with the mailbag and see what offensive
6785000	6789000	things you guys are going to email us this week.
6789000	6793000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to email us every week and DarkSakura
6793000	6797000	will dive in head first and read some emails for us.
6797000	6801000	I will. I have some. I have four emails.
6801000	6805000	Oh my god, four? Just kidding.
6805000	6809000	But first of all, person, you misspelled Voltaire.
6809000	6813000	It's V-O-L-T-A-I-R-E. So if you're going to quote somebody, which
6813000	6817000	I'm quoting Voltaire is fine by me. Make sure you spell it right, please.
6817000	6821000	Mailbag, hi, we haven't spoken in a while. I just wanted to let you in on this. I
6821000	6825000	came ahead quite a bit since I started a week ago. Just have a read.
6825000	6829000	Isn't that a spam email? No.
6829000	6833000	I'm telling you that's a spam email. You gotta
6833000	6837000	watch out for that shit. We get tons of spam in the email box.
6837000	6841000	I should just ignore bed grammar anyway.
6841000	6845000	Hello, comrades. I'm sorry, it's funny that that still was signed
6845000	6849000	with something that they're quoting a philosopher.
6849000	6853000	I find that funny. I'm sorry.
6853000	6857000	Three emails. Hello, comrades. Hope that all of you are doing well. Firstly,
6857000	6861000	I wanted to thank you for the great show. Very entertaining. Just like shooting an AK
6861000	6865000	while intoxicated. Just joking. I don't drink.
6865000	6869000	What do you guys think of the future of GTA? Will the next installment be a serious and realistic
6869000	6873000	AKA gray and muddy as the previous one? Or will it perhaps return
6873000	6877000	to a much more hilarious style like San Andreas with much more customization and humor?
6877000	6881000	This is really a Loki question, if anything. Loki,
6881000	6885000	I know you're rocking out over there, but Grand Theft Auto, what would the next one
6885000	6889000	be like? Would it be serious or whimsical? I think that they're gonna try to
6889000	6893000	bring back what they did in San Andreas. Basically,
6893000	6897000	kinda keeping it grounded a little bit, but have a little bit of extra
6897000	6901000	fun stuff like the miniguns and the parachutes and the little bit ridiculous
6901000	6905000	stuff. I think they gotta step it up a little bit as far as whimsical
6905000	6909000	and crazy because of Saints Row the Third, but
6909000	6913000	I still think they're gonna try to keep it a little bit
6913000	6917000	somewhat realistic. I think you're definitely gonna see
6917000	6921000	kind of like a San Andreas. Alrighty.
6921000	6925000	I just hope they get rid of the
6925000	6929000	I kinda call it like dating your friends, where
6929000	6933000	oh hey, let's go bowling, or hey, I wanna go play air hockey.
6933000	6937000	I don't wanna fucking play air hockey with you. I want
6937000	6941000	hoe mode. Darcy, I'm with you. I want more hoes.
6941000	6945000	I want hoe mode, where you play as a whore. I think there needs to be
6945000	6949000	a mode where when she says I wanna go play air hockey, you should say shut up bitch and suck my dick.
6949000	6953000	See? And you know what? And this is why Saints Row
6953000	6957000	in some ways is a better game than Grand Theft Auto.
6957000	6961000	Saints Row 2 does have hoe mode, where you can play as a whore. You can
6961000	6965000	be a man whore, and you can go- Oh my god, why am I not playing this game?
6965000	6969000	It's serious. It's one of the side missions you can do. I played the first Saints Row
6969000	6973000	and I was like, yeah, whatever. Oh my god. No, you need to play Saints Row 2. Saints Row- Can I borrow it?
6973000	6977000	Uh, yeah. I need to be a man whore. That's awesome. It is
6977000	6981000	a fucking awesome game. It's Saints Row 2- Did you play- You can borrow it when you lend me Dance
6981000	6985000	Masters. Did you- Shut up. Did you play- Shut up, bitch. See, I'm practicing.
6985000	6989000	Hey, hoe. Did you play as a man whore?
6989000	6993000	Well, I did the man whore missions, yes. Have you ever been a man whore, Loki?
6993000	6997000	No, but he's given a whore right now. In the game. And I gotta say, I was
6997000	7001000	fucking awesome at that. You know why? Cause it's a rhythm game in there.
7001000	7005000	It's like, it's a little- I can't remember exactly what you did. It's something with
7005000	7009000	like moving the analog sticks in certain directions, like to like a beat. But
7009000	7013000	since, you know- That's like Big Bang Bar. A little more to the left. But it
7013000	7017000	seriously, uh, I mean, they have, you know, in Saints Row they have a
7017000	7021000	mode where, I don't even remember what the hell it's called. It's basically you and one of those
7021000	7025000	bunny suits. You know how they have like the bunny suits? Mhm. Intel
7025000	7029000	and stuff like that? Right in ATV on fire and everything you run into
7029000	7033000	explodes. It's just such an awesome game. Oh god.
7033000	7037000	This, this, I- If, if, if this game convinced
7037000	7041000	Loki to get a gold star in man whoring, I've gotta check it out.
7041000	7045000	I'll loan it to you. It's, it's pretty awesome. But the third man, the third's gonna be
7045000	7049000	even better than this. It's just, I can't fathom how awesome this is
7049000	7053000	gonna be. Can't wait. Alright. Was there more
7053000	7057000	to the email? Sorry. Yes there is. We're, we're stuck thinking about hosts. I also want to inform
7057000	7061000	you guys of this great game I played as a kid. It's called Dark Earth. Okay, I wanna see how old
7061000	7065000	this is. If he's said he played it as a kid.
7065000	7069000	Uh, actually it links to something in archaeology, nevermind.
7069000	7073000	Oh, the video game. I'll find it. Hold on. Post-apocalyptic
7073000	7077000	action-adventure game for the PC. When did it come out?
7077000	7081000	It was cancelled for PS2.
7081000	7085000	Dark Earth 1997.
7085000	7089000	September 30th, 1997. You were a kid in 97. Shut the fuck up.
7089000	7093000	I'm not reading any more of this. No. Um. Don't be mean to the
7093000	7097000	emailers. The amazing story and the graphics were pretty impressive at the time. If you have the time, check it out.
7097000	7101000	You won't regret it. Stay frost comrades. Stanislav.
7101000	7105000	I'm reading up on this game. I've actually never played this. It was a PC
7105000	7109000	only game. I remember this game actually. I've seen it before. Do you really?
7109000	7113000	I never played this. Third person game centering around item collection
7113000	7117000	of weapon based combat. Huh. The environments of the game were pre-rendered
7117000	7121000	with 3D modeled characters moving atop them like Resident Evil.
7121000	7125000	Huh. Interesting. It was pretty neat.
7125000	7129000	I will have to check it out. Next email comes from Robobobobobobobobobobobobobobob.
7129000	7131000	Thanks for the game by the way Robobobob.
7131000	7133000	No the next one.
7133000	7135000	No I was just saying thanks for the game.
7135000	7137000	Robobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobb
7137000	7141000	I read the damn email. Did any of you see
7141000	7145000	the Forza 4 trailer on Xbox Live? No. I watched it and it starts with this claim
7145000	7149000	all in game footage then unless I'm wrong it shows you the CG render
7149000	7153000	to the game, followed by footage from the game, which I'm not sure looks any different
7153000	7159680	than Forza 3. CG renders are not in-game footage, even if they aren't part of the game media.
7159680	7163680	The only way that could be in-game footage is if there was a special car viewer section
7163680	7167600	that does nothing else. I wonder if that is what it is.
7167600	7173920	Um, I, I, wasn't that the one that, like, blasted the Kanye West song when you watched
7173920	7174880	the trailer? I didn't watch it.
7174880	7179400	I did see it. It was, you know, well racing games always have, I mean, at least these
7179400	7183560	days have pretty impressive graphics. It's, you know, a lot of it goes by so fast you
7183560	7187960	can't really appreciate it. Well, I also have to paste, though, how Rob
7187960	7190000	signed his email. Yes.
7190000	7194920	Because you'll only get it if you know DOS. Oh, God. That's great. I like that.
7194920	7201760	I love it. And to read it out for the listeners, 10 print Rob, 20 print B, 30 go to 20.
7201760	7205200	By the way, it's basic, not DOS. Sorry. You know what I mean.
7205200	7209000	Just so you know. I have an icon that says the home sweet home
7209000	7212400	one. I, I spent a lot of time on Commodore 64 basic
7212400	7215280	in my youth. Meanwhile, you kids, you kids were playing
7215280	7221360	Dark Earth. When I was a kid, I was typing. So what were the commands? Like run, quote,
7221360	7227400	game, quote, comma, eight, comma, no, asterisk A, asterisk B.
7227400	7230760	You might've been playing Dark Earth as a kid. I was typing in programs from the back
7230760	7233760	of compute gazette. Just so you know.
7233760	7241600	We had the, oh God, what was the, the, the Tandy book of, of, um, basic for the little
7241600	7246120	Tandy computer. I used to have one of those that you play
7246120	7257040	games on. Okay. Last email. Dun dun dun. Um, hello gang. This is Ramaditya. I hope I said
7257040	7259680	that right. I spoke to Rob earlier and as a blind gamer,
7259680	7262760	I would like to give my personal thoughts about one of the topics brought up in the
7262760	7265440	last show. It is about an invention that could help blind
7265440	7270160	persons see using connect as assistive device. I asked for an email like this. Hooray.
7270160	7273760	However, because my English vocabularies are somewhat limited, I'll try to explain as best
7273760	7278160	I can. I hope you can catch what I mean. This is what I understand. In order to make connect
7278160	7283400	work, it needs to recognize the visual objects it points to. For example, if I want to know
7283400	7287600	that there is a glass in front of me, I must put my connect to it and an audio message
7287600	7291840	will tell me there is a glass. It means that my connect must have proper information about
7291840	7296000	the object so that it can recognize it properly so the object must contain something special
7296000	7300320	that the connect can recognize. With this aid, we are faced with the circumstance that
7300320	7306240	visual objects are a lot, color, shape, letters, et cetera. So it is probably impossible for
7306240	7311200	the device to recognize all of them. For example, if I stand in front of the mall, it will be
7311200	7315400	difficult for the device to identify various activities in front of me, walking people,
7315400	7320640	sending children, moving trolley, et cetera. So the device may not be able to replace working
7320640	7325280	eyes, but there is still a way to make the device useful and more effectively. We need
7325280	7330800	a specific object that can universally be recognized. What a coincidence that the idea
7330800	7335880	came from Rob himself. Well, QR code can be one. That's basically QR code usually contains
7335880	7340880	text or number, and those are universal, e.g. the numbers are number nine is the same around
7340880	7345920	the world, letter A is also the same, and many other examples that you can make yourself.
7345920	7349580	So we use the device like a reading tool or transportation recognizer, and it's like what
7349580	7355780	Rob told. When it scans the QR code attached to the bus, it would speak bus to Canada goes
7355780	7360680	at 7 a.m. Another example, the inventor can install a small GPS so that it can help blind
7360680	7365200	people navigate easily. You are facing north, the device says, and when you walk straight,
7365200	7368940	it finds a QR code embedded at the next exit door that will read northern exit, go south
7368940	7374240	to Dunkin Donuts. If you want to implement Kinect as a gaming device which is accessible
7374240	7378520	for the blind, perhaps bodily movement can be considered as universal target that the
7378520	7383360	device can recognize. Perhaps when you play one-on-one lightsaber battle, both players
7383360	7387200	can face each other and use a Kinect like a lightsaber, and the device held by the blind
7387200	7391120	player can inform the position or movement his or her opponent makes. Combined with the
7391120	7395800	sound effects from the game, it can be great. Another possible implementation is to use
7395800	7399680	the device in card games like, well I forget, but there was that one PS3 one which came
7399680	7406440	out with the physical cards. Oh. I have judgment. Yeah. That was the one where you all bet if
7406440	7411400	I could sell one million and Loki must dress as Tingle. Yes, correct. The physical cards
7411400	7416560	must contain label or QR code that tells Kinect which cards the player holds so the player
7416560	7420520	can use it properly based on the information given by Kinect. For example, this is dragon
7420520	7425000	card facing up, this is golem card facing down, etc. Yep, that's my personal thought
7425000	7429920	about the topic, but I do support whatever result may come out. Okay, before I conclude
7429920	7434320	this email, let me give you my YouTube video. It's me playing frog's theme with my recorder.
7434320	7439560	Hope you and all you listeners can enjoy it. Didn't he send us a recorder link before?
7439560	7442640	I think I remember this guy. I'm going to copy it to you, Rob. Okay, do that. I'll bring
7442640	7450100	it up here real quick. Well, first off, I think if I understood the point of the email
7450100	7455000	correctly, it was that I'm a genius for my idea with the QR codes last week, so I totally
7455000	7461600	agree with the email 100%, might I say. You're so awful. And I do have to say, if English
7461600	7465000	isn't your first language, you still did a fantastic job. I know you did better than
7465000	7468720	some people who emailed us. You did better than people who have grown up here all of
7468720	7483760	their lives, so thank you for being awesome. Let me bring this up a little bit. I love
7483760	7488560	that because you know he's got a deep appreciation for this game. I want to say the last video
7488560	7493520	I saw of him playing the recorder was Scars of Time, I think it was. I think so. So clearly
7493520	7499160	this kid loves his chrono. Yeah, he loves his chrono, and it's great that even though
7499160	7505960	he's blind, he kind of has that appreciation, and I think it's hard for a lot of us to understand
7505960	7513840	sometimes what it's like in that position. But certainly I can also agree that kind of
7513840	7520640	what he says at the end of the email, hey, anything that will help is a good thing, right?
7520640	7527520	Well see, this is kind of actually, it's funny because I was actually having this thought
7527520	7538280	about the use of QR codes to provide, god this was, it's kind of a weird thought that
7538280	7546480	I had, but you know how they have the reactive material that will raise and lower a certain
7546480	7550720	way based on programming? I mean there is programmable material out there. Imagine having
7550720	7555220	something that you could read a QR code and then having the braille for it for example
7555220	7563040	show up on a small platform or on a stylus or something. Or even like an iPhone app that
7563040	7566840	you can hold up your phone, read the code, and it will have a speaker attached to it
7566840	7573320	so it says so and so or record voice signal or something. What do you think? Yeah, I think
7573320	7579000	we have all these technologies now like the QR code, GPS is so cheap to implement in devices
7579000	7584480	now too. I think we're just a matter of time away. I have to tell you though, and I'd actually
7584480	7591320	like to get some of our blind listeners feedback on this too. I watched a special probably
7591320	7601300	a couple years ago about using audio location to be able to tell distance. It was a guy
7601300	7608200	blind from birth riding a bicycle down the street that had cars all around, people crossing
7608200	7613440	the street and making clicking noises. He was able to tell his location and what was
7613440	7620280	close to him by the clicking sound. I was thinking if you had something sort of like
7620280	7626760	Kinect that would attach like say to a bicycle or a vehicle of some sort that would give
7626760	7633680	you an audio clue instead as you know like you said the GPS. You can have a GPS that
7633680	7639160	would also you know fill in your spatial items to maybe have like an emergency break that
7639160	7642760	keeps you from running into something too. But my whole point with that is that if you
7642760	7647600	have something like that implemented say into a driving game, then it could give the same
7647600	7653760	feeling of driving without necessarily being able to see where you're going. Wow, crazy
7653760	7658520	thought. But I got the idea from watching that show. By the way just real quick I did
7658520	7663200	some folks are requesting the video so that they could watch it at full volume. So there's
7663200	7666560	a link right there in chat. I put that there. Sorry to those folks that are listening on
7666560	7671560	the podcast feed but you'll just have to do a search for that. What was it labeled as
7671560	7675880	and you can tell? Let me see, let me see what it's labeled as real quick here. Was that
7675880	7682320	the last email by the way? Yes it was. Alright that was the last email. The name on YouTube
7682320	7691360	is Ramaditya Skywalker. R-A-M-A-D-I-T-Y-A. Skywalker. S-K-Y-W-A-L-K-E-R. So there you
7691360	7695320	go. You can look that up and I'm sure, I think he probably has, it's 61 videos so who knows
7695320	7699320	what else is in there but I'm assuming there's a lot of recorder stuff in there. So check
7699320	7704200	that out. I see yeah Tin Whistle, Ship Final, yeah he's got some other videos too. I have
7704200	7709920	a Tin Whistle, I have two of them. But I'm not any good at it. Very cool. I should learn
7709920	7715960	to play my melodica, maybe we could do a YouTube duet. Do a duet? That'd be awesome. Alright
7715960	7721120	that's it for the mailbag. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send in your emails for a future
7721120	7746880	week. Meanwhile let's get to the FUs of the week. I would like to say FU to my skin for
7746880	7754280	not getting quite as much sun as I wanted today. But I am happy to say that I don't
7754280	7762000	have skin cancer yet and yeah. Well Harada not having skin cancer that's a good thing.
7762000	7765480	I'm trying to get a little bit more sun because you remember I've always been super super
7765480	7770520	super pale and I decided that it's time for me to look a little healthier. I think I look
7770520	7777080	healthy. You need your vitamin D. Yes. D for diva. I know. Well I was thinking Dan but.
7777080	7785680	Loki do you have an FU? Just FU to people being sick. My FU of the week goes to this
7785680	7788840	microphone because I think it's dying and I really don't want to buy another microphone
7788840	7795800	but fine if that's what I have to do I will. And FU to I don't know my skin too, my skin
7795800	7801340	sucks too. I have the whole like this is gonna be gross but I have like the whole like flaky
7801340	7806840	thing going on in some parts it's gross I hate it. I know I use similar stuff I do but
7806840	7813320	it only lasts so long and then it's like happens again. Well I'm the reason why I'm actually
7813320	7816960	and I hate to plug. An FU to the outro playing right there that was too early. To plug you
7816960	7820720	know because they're not paying us clearly. But since I started using I'm using the hoof
7820720	7827060	maker stuff and it actually made the eczema on my knuckles go away. Funny enough my hands
7827060	7830560	are fine. My hands never a problem. In fact I get a lot of compliments on my hands. But
7830560	7835000	I've started using it on my knees. And it I'm just saying it helped. There you go. Alright
7835000	7841000	well anyhow let's move on. Couple quick stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1877
7841000	7845880	game OLR. Loki. You know it's funny I was just watching video for some of the Saints
7845880	7850880	Row 3rd stuff just because it's fun watching the video over and over and over again. They
7850880	7857160	announced their hyper ordinary pre-order pack and this will be included with games that
7857160	7865520	you pre-order I'm assuming anywhere but you know it may be just certain outlets but it's
7865520	7871040	Professor Genki's hyper ordinary pre-order pack. It gets you a few things the Professor
7871040	7880680	Genki suit which Professor Genki you don't know about the game it's this weird like Japanese
7880680	7887160	game show within the actual game and Professor Genki is this really like tripped out looking
7887160	7892120	cat. Kind of thinking like the Cheshire Cat. But you get this suit that looks like a stunt
7892120	7898080	suit with that giant cat head. The Manipult car which is basically a car with the cat
7898080	7905840	head on the front that has a giant cannon that you can get it a cat a bolt. It's a Manipult.
7905840	7913320	You can suck people pedestrians up in to the cannon and fire them out. And then of course
7913320	7919060	there's a weapon that's an octopus gun that fires octopuses that land on or octopi that
7919060	7926400	land on people's heads. And if that's not crazy enough for you they have the platinum
7926400	7932640	pack that's available which I'm seriously considering buying this. That comes with a
7932640	7939400	headset that auto tunes your voice automatically. That's kind of worth it in the price of there
7939400	7943660	and as well as the soundtrack and I'm sure some other fun bonuses in there as well. Of
7943660	7949660	course the headset does not work with Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network. Well it does
7949660	7954240	but you have to buy a little adapter but you know what it's still worth it to have a headset
7954240	7958100	that auto tunes your voice. That might be worth it just for the show. I could do a whole
7958100	7964160	show auto tuned. You know it's funny that the subject of auto tune came up on last night's
7964160	7970520	under station live and you've got to check out this app on the iPhone. It's called songify
7970520	7976120	and it's an app where you can like make instant songs out of like whatever. I don't want to
7976120	7981960	rip off the bit from us all but I feel like now I have to demo it. So okay so here's songify
7981960	7988160	and what should I sing about? Tell me what to sing about. Sing about hemorrhoids. Okay
7988160	7992600	I'm not going to sing about hemorrhoids that's gross. Sing about. I'll sing a song about
7992600	8000400	Loki. Sing about Lady Gaga. No I'll sing a song about Loki. Okay here we go. Loki went
8000400	8009880	to round table pizza and got a pizza with cheese and pepperoni but no bacon. Okay so
8009880	8016160	now it's going to do its thing so here we go. Oh hold on. I did it wrong. It wasn't
8016160	8020560	recording that whole time. Hold on. Live radio. I know live radio. Hey shut up. Hold on here
8020560	8029700	we go. Here we go. Loki went to round table pizza. He didn't get the bacon pizza because
8029700	8042800	bacon makes you fat. Okay here we go. Loki went to round table pizza. Loki went to round
8042800	8050920	table pizza. He didn't get the bacon pizza because bacon fat pizza. He didn't get the
8050920	8064040	bacon pizza because bacon makes you fat. Loki went to round table pizza. Loki went to round
8064040	8071020	table pizza. So obviously it's not perfect because you know it kind of cuts out a little
8071020	8077440	bit there but the duo is awesome. Songify you said? Yeah songify. It's free but I guess
8077440	8080760	the way they make money is you can download other add-ons and so forth. Like for instance
8080760	8085320	I just got one that says sounds like you can sing. Have you tried La Di Da? Rumor is Kesha
8085320	8090120	uses it to sing better. Cute little things like that. Oh I have to tell you. You know
8090120	8095240	how I talked about the blow video? I found out who the director was and he did some other
8095240	8100860	videos that are freaking hilarious. This guy is like amazing. Hate on Kesha all you want
8100860	8104000	but that blow video is pretty fucking rad. I know well that was the director. We found
8104000	8109460	the director's other videos. That's awesome. So anyway I had to say that. Alright. It was
8109460	8116040	me and Becky and Susan in here just watching the hell out of these. It was so funny. Alright
8116040	8119880	one more story for you guys here and it has to do with sports games. It's more of an opinion
8119880	8124420	piece but since we're a little short on news tonight I thought I'd, by the way I'm loving
8124420	8128640	these comments in chat right now. People trying to vote for that song in the cage match. You
8128640	8134880	can't vote for that song. Stop it. What's it called? Songify? Songify. S-O-N-G-I-F-I-Y
8134880	8142120	or something like that. Anyhow. Why You Should Stop Hating on Sports Games. It's an opinion
8142120	8150280	piece that came from VentureBeat.com and talks about why sports games, you know a lot of
8150280	8155420	the masses tend to hate on sports games. It's roster update and another fucking Madden games
8155420	8160920	coming out. Who buys those games anyway right? Well a sports guru for Electronic Arts says
8160920	8165160	as part of the story, quote, the point of our games is not reenacting throwing a football
8165160	8169920	but the spirit of the sport and letting gamers fulfill their sports dreams. These are real
8169920	8175560	players. There are real events and there is real angst. We want to reenact reality. The
8175560	8180060	opinion piece goes on to talk about how sports games have a role in driving forward innovation
8180060	8186320	for the entire video game industry and that's why you should take them seriously. I guess
8186320	8191540	goes on to talk about NBA 2K11, the game that reenacts some of basketball's finest moments
8191540	8197640	because that was the one that brought back Jordan in there. I guess saying that some
8197640	8202320	people were too young to experience that back in 92 but the video game helps them relive
8202320	8206860	an experience that they actually missed the first time around. The games include tons
8206860	8212400	and tons of commentary from people that actually commentate on sports in the real industry
8212400	8216720	and I think a lot that kind of went through this as well and it talked about that I thought
8216720	8223480	made a good point is having to re-up the reality of these games every year. The opinion piece
8223480	8227880	from VentureBeat.com says sports games are a main source of revenue for Electronic Arts
8227880	8232680	so a lot of the innovation in terms of graphics and realistic physics happens in that department
8232680	8238680	and trickles down to other games. EA for example uses the collision engines originally built
8238680	8243720	in for Madden in games like Battlefield 3. Each year those teams build and rebuild physics
8243720	8247960	and animation engines for their in-game characters and then other games reap the rewards of those
8247960	8253200	engines. Physics and animation in our very core games have been very driven by sports
8253200	8257920	games since the inception of the technology. That physics and animation had to be in a
8257920	8262760	sports games for many years shooters didn't need it and then it goes on to talk about
8262760	8268560	artificial intelligence is a big part of that as well when you play against sports teams
8268560	8273520	and then that the sports franchise did start this whole once a year cycle but World of
8273520	8279120	Warcraft does the same thing, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, DDR I would throw out there
8279120	8284420	again. I thought that was kind of interesting. What do you guys think about sports games?
8284420	8289000	Do they get a bad rap in the industry or are they important to the industry as a whole?
8289000	8296840	I think that you have to appeal to everyone's fandoms. I mean not every guy out there is
8296840	8302400	gonna like you know to play the RPGs. Not every girl out there is gonna like to play
8302400	8309240	adventure games. You know it's every they've got a market there. Sports especially well
8309240	8314640	actually really all over the world I mean football is such a big thing in you know in
8314640	8319160	Europe I'm talking about real football not the shit we call football here. That's an
8319160	8323800	opinion young lady. I know I'm talking about opinion piece so I'm giving my opinion. Fine
8323800	8333560	don't judge me. Judging a little bit. Sorry. Counter judge. But it's important yeah first
8333560	8339520	of all it's a source of revenue. That means that you know for every you know Madden game
8339520	8348640	EA puts out we get another Sims. So it's a necessary evil. I don't have to like it. Going
8348640	8352640	to our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrategy.com Tiger Claw says so all the nerds are complaining
8352640	8356560	about sports games don't they realize that some of the most beloved video games are sports
8356560	8361520	games that nerds enjoy? Blades of Steel, Mario Kart anyone? You know I posted about this
8361520	8365760	to my Google Plus and I got some really interesting comments and because I didn't say that I would
8365760	8370400	read them on air I don't want to read them verbatim on air and but I will just kind of
8370400	8374160	summarize one comment that I thought was very interesting was about somebody who said you
8374160	8378560	know I really enjoy the sports games especially the football games and why I like them is
8378560	8385440	that I can't really play sports game or I can't play football IRL I can't play professional
8385440	8389980	football because I'm a tall skinny dude I'm not built for professional football these
8389980	8394000	games let me live out that experience that kind of ties into what the beginning of that
8394000	8401640	article said how you know it's about letting folks kind of reenact an experience I guess
8401640	8404960	you could say and I can see the same thing with basketball you know you have to be a
8404960	8408960	very certain body type to be able to really play competitive basketball but it's the same
8408960	8413760	reason why people do fantasy football and whatever right Loki? I still think though
8413760	8418600	they're they're dodging the actual problem with sports games and I'm not even just gonna
8418600	8422920	limit it to sports games it can be a lot of games that feel that they need to release
8422920	8428260	a new title in the franchise every year is the fact that they don't change very much
8428260	8432800	year to year so that still didn't address the fact that when people call it just a roster
8432800	8437820	update oh okay they tweak a few things to make things more realistic good for you why
8437820	8442920	does that justify another $60 because I don't really think that you went back to the ground
8442920	8447680	level and like rebuilt the whole game from scratch I think that you're just tweaking
8447680	8451240	it a little bit to make it a little bit better but you know what tweaks like that can be
8451240	8457760	done to older games and then patched in I don't understand why you need to release a
8457760	8462680	game every year what about the idea of just throwing it out there that sports games set
8462680	8468760	the bar so to speak that other games end up using like the whole physics and engine being
8468760	8475760	used in Call of Duty I don't think that they do I mean I've seen it well the guy from electronic
8475760	8481440	arts said oh oh I'm sorry he's not biased at all you know electronic arts a company
8481440	8487080	that you know my ton of its money off of sports games and they have some of the largest sports
8487080	8492040	franchises out there would totally not be skewed towards sports games at all I he's
8492040	8496920	gonna say well you're right our games aren't very realistic at all I think that every bit
8496920	8506920	of game research no matter the type of game can benefit for example if you want a realistic
8506920	8511520	physics for example a sports game actually is a really good judge of doing realistic
8511520	8516040	physics for example you want to know how fully inflated basketball is going to bounce on
8516040	8521360	a certain type of floor with a certain type of push you have to program all that in you
8521360	8527560	know say that you take that into like for example Sims and they do suddenly they have
8527560	8533080	like you can play basketball and Sims okay but I mean I'm but say that the same time
8533080	8539680	you take like like an adventure game and you have a puzzle put in with it where you have
8539680	8543600	to bounce said object off of a certain thing at a certain place what if they took this
8543600	8547360	physics from a basketball game what if it was vice versa what if basketball game took
8547360	8553840	the physics from there I think that it's a matter of your perspective I also call bullshit
8553840	8558700	on the fact that they say that oh our sports games set the bar you know for you know level
8558700	8562560	of realism and that kind of well if that's the case then you have these wonderful engines
8562560	8566680	that calculate all these physics and stuff why aren't you using them for other games
8566680	8571880	oh because you're not because the other game engines work just as well and you know what
8571880	8576480	I would argue that the physics in those games are set to a realistic level that applies
8576480	8580320	to the game you don't want super realistic physics for halo you want it to be a little
8580320	8588280	bit you know unrealistic so that it's fun I mean no one can jump like 50 feet in the
8588280	8594840	air and stuff like that I mean that there's a little bit of fantasy there but I mean if
8594840	8598360	they really want super realistic games then why aren't they building no madden in the
8598360	8604320	crytek engine or unreal 3 or something like that hell there is a you know was it backbreaker
8604320	8609840	a game that had really realistic physics and that sports game didn't sell very well at
8609840	8617000	all and I think that you know people yeah I understand there's a lot of people that
8617000	8621320	oh I can't play real sports so I'm gonna play this game that's fine I can't drive a race
8621320	8626520	car but I'll still drive you know a car in a game I can't go murder people but also play
8626520	8630880	you know a game like that let me read some comments from chat because chat rooms lighting
8630880	8635000	up on the story and I think there's some really excellent comments in the chat room here from
8635000	8639920	all sides of the spectrum xena core says rob that's bullcrap the updates they do to the
8639920	8644520	engine are no better than patches you really don't get your money's worth if you keep up
8644520	8650200	year to year how often do your other examples charge full price for an incremental update
8650200	8653800	break room and chat says I couldn't play in the NFL because I would pee myself if I saw
8653800	8658840	some guy like Ray Lewis looking at me like he's gonna kill me he just might kill me every
8658840	8663780	NFL game I have played has been different in some way sometimes there are slight differences
8663780	8668940	dark Tetsuya says yeah that's why I love need for speed legally I can't really drive but
8668940	8673120	I've always grown up loving cars and games like that let me imagine what it's like driving
8673120	8678840	an expensive car I'll never own really freaking fast it's a really good analogy there break
8678840	8683240	room also says I love Dragon Quest games and I will buy the next Dragon Quest game how
8683240	8687360	much of those games really changed well hold on to be fair I mean you do have a whole new
8687360	8694240	story new characters new environments new maps I mean I don't know if I really follow
8694240	8701180	the DQ analogy because you know there is they're completely different story here's the thing
8701180	8706040	I mean and let's let's talk about sports games here NCAA football one of the big updates
8706040	8711880	this year was all the pregame rituals you know like the the different mascots coming
8711880	8717500	across the field and in the little tweaks and stuff like that all stuff that you would
8717500	8723160	say yes let's see the experience but not necessarily the gameplay I don't think that you know the
8723160	8727480	fact that the mascot looks realistic and does we know whatever the mascot does normally
8727480	8732800	in the game lends itself to playing a better football game you know that's the kind of
8732800	8736460	tweaks that they're doing because how much can you really do with gameplay I mean every
8736460	8740780	now and then yes they go back to the drawing board and they completely rebuild the game
8740780	8744960	from scratch like NBA elite for example or whatever the hell they're gonna call it when
8744960	8750640	it comes out in 2012 now that is going back to the drawing board but why did they go back
8750640	8754160	to the drawing board not because hey you know what we need to make a better game it's because
8754160	8758760	our game wasn't selling very well and then we made a new game and it really sucked and
8758760	8763900	so now we have to go back to the drawing board it and you know what yeah you know I'd say
8763900	8767460	the same thing with you know modern warfare I don't think that they really need to release
8767460	8770820	a new game each year to their credit though at least there's a new storyline that goes
8770820	8777340	along with it so there's a little bit something but I mean it's just there's but sports games
8777340	8782000	though there's not really a necessary you don't need to write a new story for it it's
8782000	8786620	a sports game and to be interested interestingly enough wrestling I think the the gaming community
8786620	8793140	rejected music games doing this you know our opinion with DDR and such is a little bit
8793140	8797740	skewed because those were games you know we really loved but like games like Guitar Hero
8797740	8802660	failed because the market was too saturated with them Rock Band essentially Harmonix has
8802660	8805820	said you know what we need to take a break from Rock Band because you know Rock Band
8805820	8810220	3 unfortunately didn't sell well compared because there were just so many Rock Band
8810220	8815740	games coming out so I think it's sometimes these yearly update games get rejected by
8815740	8819540	marketplace anyway I want to read a couple other comments from chat and then go to our
8819540	8823300	phone lines because I'm sure folks want to call in on this quickly Dark Soccer before
8823300	8827780	I go to chat okay well I was actually there is an exception to the rule when it comes
8827780	8833380	to the sports games and I really think it's the wrestling games because those if you keep
8833380	8838080	up with wrestling it's like soap opera interesting because that's that is the one game I would
8838080	8842940	not make the exception for but everybody everybody's got an opinion that's fine because like you
8842940	8848500	know they they change whoever's popular at the time sure you know people you know there's
8848500	8853740	a face turn or a heel turn and you've got to keep up with storylines and they try to
8853740	8859500	recreate what it's like watching the show in the games so that makes sense to me all
8859500	8862420	right let me go to the chairman chat that orange laundry.com for a couple more comments
8862420	8867480	DDR dollar bill and our charm says I can't drive real cars but doing it online was awesome
8867480	8872940	oh and flying sims are fantastic you know I gotta say even though I might talk about
8872940	8875820	and I'll play a lot of sports games I don't play a lot of Madden because I'm not super
8875820	8880380	into football I don't play a lot of basketball games because I'm not super into it although
8880380	8885380	it is the sport I probably enjoy more than most others and I do love NBA Jam the old
8885380	8889300	one I'm not as big on the new one but I'm curious about this whole arcade one they're
8889300	8895840	putting out you know super high impact but one thing one game I love our racing games
8895840	8901200	I love a lot of those racing games but I usually like the arcade racers more and I like the
8901200	8906940	realistic ones like I can't do forza I can't do Gran Turismo but I loved blur I like Mario
8906940	8914820	Kart I really loved f-zero I will always love f-zero what about Initial D I like Initial
8914820	8922700	D and I love I really like Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 so you know anyhow let's see also
8922700	8929380	one other few comments here I love this comment from Tiger Claw sports games have been around
8929380	8936500	since the first arcade game pong basically tennis interesting interesting point I like
8936500	8942980	that and then let's see one other comment what I want to say break room says I love
8942980	8947980	sports games but when I when I have ever tried to play in real sports I was never any good
8947980	8951740	a skinny white guy doesn't line up well in high school sports but give me a controller
8951740	8956940	and it's fun to pretend SSU 100 Matt says listen I've been a hockey fan for most of
8956940	8961200	my life and used to play when I was younger I love the game of hockey so much that I gladly
8961200	8965420	pay for the yearly update NHL games I enjoy playing the game because it's the closest
8965420	8969380	I can get to playing with my favorite players and favorite teams than I can possibly ever
8969380	8974640	get I would gladly play the pay the yearly $60 cost to play the game that I truly enjoy
8974640	8980460	watching playing and being a fan of I guess we'll leave it at that if you want to send
8980460	8984960	in your own comments for the future mailbag at orange lounge radio.com meanwhile let's
8984960	8989240	go to the phones are going to open up the phone line right now 1877 game OLR or our
8989240	8994160	username on Skype is orange lounge radio now that it works yeah now Skype is all better
8994160	8998060	now it wasn't really broken last week just for some of dark soccer side projects it was
8998060	9003260	a little screwy I guess on some of her guest appearances this week but hooray for other
9003260	9008660	versions of Skype on the PSP and the iPhone and so forth again we're going to go to the
9008660	9012360	phone here but while we wait for the calls to come in I will ask Loki quickly if he has
9012360	9015700	any last minute stories he wants to share with us I don't know if there's anything that
9015700	9019660	came up I don't think it was a very busy news week we might have hit one at all it wasn't
9019660	9025940	there is a maybe there may have been one thing or two that we hadn't hit up on I'm trying
9025940	9038860	to remember the hell they were though looking it up real quick here let's see I know there
9038860	9043740	is something that we missed again 1877 game OLR or his name on Skype is orange lounge
9043740	9047740	radio maybe maybe you know the story that Loki missed all right it's coming up I have
9047740	9051740	a story what actually I do have a last minute story but we'll wait till after this call
9051740	9056340	yeah let's do the call hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this yo guys it's Enoch
9056340	9061240	or from the OKC how y'all doing hey Zina core how's it how's it going in the OKC man I'm
9061240	9066860	pissed off man I went and went off to work I set my DVR to record the World Cup and of
9066860	9070820	course to stop recording right before the shootout although I know how it ended I didn't
9070820	9076740	get to see how it ended oh my god you miss you miss the the like it's so funny about
9076740	9081500	soccer games that come down to that is like that like whole like five minutes is like
9081500	9086820	the entire game right there that sucks it gets right before they start running out on
9086820	9090300	the field and it's like this is the end of recording it's like oh you bastard I'll kill
9090300	9093980	you sorry to hear it well how is OKC these days that's the city I haven't been to since
9093980	9100700	I was 17 it's hot man I feel like going through the whole good morning Vietnam rant about
9100700	9104900	it being too hot in Vietnam but I'll tell you the truth but you know after you've been
9104900	9109500	in 130 100 is nothing all right like I guess we should bring it back to games though so
9109500	9114800	what's on your mind about the gaming world today I've been sort of preparing for Dark
9114800	9119380	Souls the best way I can that's why putting Demon's Souls back in my machine that's a
9119380	9123460	game I need to go back and play more of Demon's Souls is so unkind though that game is that
9123460	9129460	game is just not nice well this time I'm backing myself up with the wiki so the the Demon's
9129460	9134820	Soul wiki they put so much information that thing is ridiculous so now I there's a plan
9134820	9138780	what now I have to do is survive it why why do you want to play a game like I'm being
9138780	9141420	devil's advocate of course why do you want to play a game like Demon's Souls because
9141420	9146920	that game is too fucking hard are you a masochist sir no because you have to struggle to truly
9146920	9152500	achieve anything and most of the games nowadays just hang you the ending on a silver platter
9152500	9157660	oh snap all you have to do is oh I played it for 50 hours I'm almost near the end now
9157660	9161980	there's no challenge in it you don't have to get better at the game to see the ending
9161980	9166260	sir I think that might have been a dig at Final Fantasy I'm not quite sure no this is
9166260	9173340	gaming in general man I'm covering the whole scope that's true that's true it's like I
9173340	9177700	went back and started playing some old school select even like Star Fox 64 it has a certain
9177700	9181660	requirement of skill in order to finish it you know granted that game is a you know a
9181660	9186100	corridor shooter so there's some skill required but you can't just sit there and flip and
9186100	9190100	smash buttons and get through it you actually have to pay attention to what you're doing
9190100	9195140	and learn how to play the game so what do you hope they improve on in the next integration
9195140	9203480	of the souls series hmm I think the only thing they could really improve on is maybe like
9203480	9209360	if they didn't if they could get the whole environment into one gigantic street streaming
9209360	9214980	level like just a big ass castle so that way although you can teleport to different areas
9214980	9218060	of the castle you can actually walk the whole thing from one thing to the other that would
9218060	9223740	actually be kind of cool oh god I you calling and asking about that game makes me really
9223740	9226660	want to go back and play it because I'll tell you I didn't get very far even though I spent
9226660	9233360	hours yeah you got to talk to panda she's the out of everybody in the all games community
9233360	9237700	I could think of she's probably the one person I know of that's actually finished it wow
9237700	9242020	finished yeah she's got a character like this is like level 120 or something so you know
9242020	9246900	you have to put some time in to get a character that high yeah that's that's dedication that's
9246900	9251640	indication well anything else in your mind this week uh no just that and that whole thing
9251640	9256080	about the uh the the incremental updating for uh the sports games I mean if it was on
9256080	9261560	a pc you just get patches now and again for all that information I mean granted the fans
9261560	9265340	who want to pay it just so they can have the updated team rosters that's fine but they
9265340	9271380	just be just as happy if they got it in a patch isn't a lot of that crap also dlc uh
9271380	9275120	it could be dlc too like for instance yeah an updated roster cost you three bucks or
9275120	9278780	whatever they wouldn't have to release a whole new game it would be nothing but profit they
9278780	9282600	wouldn't have to reprint or anything else like that you know now that the dlc has been
9282600	9286180	pushed out there I could see them easily doing that but I don't think they want to like the
9286180	9290260	exact most of the executives will do don't mess with the money you know so keep it coming
9290260	9293620	the way they're used to paying for it and maybe we can keep that money coming in the
9293620	9298180	way we want it all right all right so well I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more
9298180	9301580	calls but thanks for your call no problem guys all right take it easy take care buddy
9301580	9306980	show stay stay in the shade all right one eight seven seven game olr or his name on

9350580	9356540	already sounds really good I mean the trailer just has like a little like mix of the various
9356540	9361780	songs but it's it sounds fantastic I really hope they release like a soundtrack cd for
9361780	9365660	it oh like they did the other games yeah those soundtracks are awesome have you ever actually
9365660	9370860	driven to those soundtracks um yeah actually I did I used to drive from high school and

9413660	9420640	released in the arcades as wangin midnight are and it was basically like a um uh Tokyo
9420640	9425760	extreme racer type game and the music in it was different from like the standard trance
9425760	9432300	music it was more orchestral but it was by the same guy yuzo koshiro so well yeah and
9432300	9436600	yuzo koshiro he knows his orchestral stuff too uh he did the music for the game actraiser
9436600	9440660	on the super nintendo which is one of the greatest soundtracks ever produced it's it's
9440660	9445740	amazing my favorite yeah so he's a he's a very he's a very talented guy this stuff for

9450020	9454420	yuzo koshiro not bring that game up did you get the streets of rage remix yeah I did get
9454420	9460740	the remake before um Sega took it down it was I I loved it yeah um I actually played
9460740	9464980	the um played it with a computer player helping me out and I forgot to turn off the damage
9464980	9470180	between players so I ended up hitting the computer player more often than I ended up
9470180	9475940	hitting the enemies nice last time I played streets of rage was on the sonics mega genesis
9475940	9480780	collection or whatever for the xbox 360 no I have the ps3 one actually and it's got like
9480780	9486100	streets of rage one two and three so it's a great deal and along with a shit ton of
9486100	9491380	other genesis games it's great so yeah all right well any other games we should be looking
9491380	9497580	out for this week um no nothing else I was just calling about one gun because I'm a pretty
9497580	9503440	big fan of that and initial d initial d love it hey those those are the games like that
9503440	9507380	are kind of keeping some arcades afloat right now with actual arcades as opposed to kitty
9507380	9511360	gambling like you go to the local golf land here those are really the only games that
9511360	9515120	made me stop and go oh I kind of want to actually spend money on this game because there's so
9515120	9522100	much crap now you know that spit out tickets and so forth so the sad thing is um the newer
9522100	9527620	initial d games like versions five and six they have not gotten like proper english versions
9527620	9534300	because um sega just probably just gave up on localizing them and sad well the good news
9534300	9539420	is the playstation 3 is region free so hopefully this new uh game that they're releasing in
9539420	9543460	the arcades maybe we'll get a decent home version of it even if it's only in japan at
9543460	9547300	least we can import it over here yeah I've been considering getting a ps3 because of
9547300	9552840	the initial d game I've watched all of the anime pretty much it's fantastic you are really
9552840	9557380	into these games then if you've gone so far as to watch the anime that's pretty cool yeah
9557380	9560220	all right we gotta let you go to get some more calls but thanks so much for your call
9560220	9565740	all right all right have a good one buddy and here's a hint don't go driving down a
9565740	9569460	baron freeway to the soundtracks one of those games because you you might not uh realize
9569460	9572980	how fast you're going dark soccer let me have you work in your story real quick here before
9572980	9579520	I go back to the phone okay um the story is actually that the creator of vvvv made a super
9579520	9585100	meat boy tribute sort of he did a super meat boy flash game that's in the style of his
9585100	9594060	own game vvvv so um it's actually available at distractionware.com slash games slash flash
9594060	9599620	slash meat boy and he says it's only a couple of screens long and very broken I can't wait
9599620	9604000	for the next t meat game just saying let's go to the phones and take another call hi
9604000	9608780	you're on orange launch radio who's this hi yeah this is spazzinator hey spazzinator what's
9608780	9616420	on your mind buddy uh a couple things actually um uh two talks on what we were talking about
9616420	9624580	a few months ago with uh the whole ea constantly releasing new games yeah every well and in
9624580	9631060	fact you had mentioned I believe why don't they just release yearly patches uh instead
9631060	9639740	of releasing new games uh to to use that analogy this uh I'll ask a rhetorical question how
9639740	9648660	much uh did dark soccer pay for the you know the 4.2 patch in world of warcraft nothing
9648660	9656740	right right nothing well you know that uh that uh that uh you know that kind of illustrates
9656740	9663420	the point that really you can't really charge for patches well they can update you know
9663420	9670500	update uh mad in 20 billion times you know with patches spazzinator let me play devil's
9670500	9677380	you can't really make 60 off spazzing maybe but let me play devil's advocate here for
9677380	9680840	a minute though you could say that she got the patches free but you could also say she's
9680840	9686080	paying 14.95 a month to get the patch because you know mmo's are kind of their own little
9686080	9690980	beast because you do pay a subscription fee for most of them now granted some are free
9690980	9697180	to play but they just make their money in other ways yeah yeah true uh perhaps I really
9697180	9704060	picked a really poor example for my analogy that's right you know but um kind of uh well
9704060	9711940	you even if you had uh let's say uncharted one you know the the patch analogy would apply
9711940	9720340	because there's no monthly charge for uncharted but right uh but yeah now if they were to
9720340	9728020	release you know the yearly increments and mad and on on desk you know with uh you know
9728020	9732340	that and then yeah they can make their 60 bucks every single time you know it's kind
9732340	9739140	of like uh I you know why uh kill the gold you know the goose that's laying the golden
9739140	9744660	eggs or at least gimp it anyway when they can keep it nice and healthy and get all the
9744660	9749300	golden eggs you know well it's kind of like making sequels to movies you know they don't
9749300	9756500	release those for free so uh yeah I don't know yes yeah well you know one final note
9756500	9763740	before I do uh let you go and sure so you can take uh just a quick update as to what's
9763740	9771420	going on with my playstation 3 thing I know everyone's kind of asking about it so um well
9771420	9780620	right now getting repairs temporarily on hold if uh if only because uh because of uh bureaucratic
9780620	9790260	red tape with uh my social security disability payees office work uh offices uh I can't put
9790260	9796420	in a request for the extra funds for like two weeks ago you know two weeks ago so it's
9796420	9804140	always a money issue right now just just uh real life economical money stuff yeah and
9804140	9811300	basically yeah yeah yeah uh you know apparently I need to do you know I have her do some paperwork
9811300	9818500	and I have to sign data they got taken care of this past Friday but to be fair these are
9818500	9822460	these are all things that have nothing to do with Sony to be fair these are all yeah
9822460	9828460	so yeah but you know but you know you know and to make a long story short hopefully I'll
9828460	9834980	have the money uh to have it repaired this week and once I get the money I'll get the
9834980	9838260	ball rolling on having it repaired but all right well you'll have to let us know how
9838260	9841900	that repair process goes once you get that taken care of so all right well fascinating
9841900	9844420	we're gonna let you go to get some more calls but thank you for your thoughts have a good
9844420	9850940	one and good luck with the uh playstation drama bye 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on skype

9864620	9869580	of Tekken force mode you should also uh do do me a favor and put up the uh recorder video
9869580	9872500	that we had talked about earlier in the show if you didn't already do such a thing thank
9872500	9876500	you that'd be nice meanwhile I guess we have time for one more call so let's go back to
9876500	9883100	the whoa there is feedback hi caller can you hear me okay gotta let you go buddy I am sorry
9883100	9887260	can you check your connection echo one two three remember is a good thing to call sorry
9887260	9891140	that was I apologize to listeners those drive me bonkers a little bit out of my control
9891140	9895900	though I was trying to the call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey what's
9895900	9900020	up guys this is sky judo hey guys you know what's on your mind buddy and I just want
9900020	9905420	to say I just want to make two points um as far as the um the uh sports games just being
9905420	9909940	an update roster type of thing yeah um I'm not I'm not the biggest sports game player
9909940	9915020	I mean every once in a while I'll pick up uh the NBA 2k series you know just because
9915020	9918300	I like that series but what I do notice when I do pick it up maybe it's just because I
9918300	9922620	wait a couple of years before I pick it up they do add a lot more to the game especially
9922620	9928580	on the multiplayer side like right now in um the NBA games you can actually play like
9928580	9935060	you and four other uh people can actually play five other people online like you'll
9935060	9939740	be like one entire basketball team and you could go up against another team of five which
9939740	9944940	I think is great I wish they would put that in a baseball game actually have uh nine versus
9944940	9948620	mine in a baseball game I don't know why they haven't done that yet I'm pretty sure they
9948620	9953300	can do it but um you know they they they're pretty innovative is basically what I'm saying
9953300	9957820	is that they they do add stuff other than just updating the roster you know what's interesting
9957820	9961140	though is I do notice a common theme between what you're saying between what Matt's saying
9961140	9965500	and between what I think I'm gonna say for us and our support of DDR over the years even
9965500	9969860	when a lot of people didn't get it and that is you know in chat uh SJ100Matt said you
9969860	9975740	know I pay 60 bucks a year gladly because I love hockey and this is how I get close
9975740	9980380	to hockey and and for you it just sounds like you know it's replace basketball with hockey
9980380	9985020	and for you even though the rest of us might look at it and go they don't even update anything
9985020	9988740	in those games you look at it and go oh my god there's all these awesome new features
9988740	9993100	that make it more realistic am I kind of right here that maybe not everyone gets it because
9993100	9998900	not everyone is necessarily a huge fan whereas we look at DDR and we go oh but they've introduced
9998900	10003060	now you can do marvelous as opposed to perfect as well and it's a new thing and you know
10003060	10007580	not everybody gets that yeah yeah it just has to be a thing you just have to be into
10007580	10012300	it to really notice that you know the some of the subtle differences and the major differences
10012300	10017540	that they do make in a game so they do they do improve the game a lot so um yeah the update
10017540	10021140	about something is kind of like a crazy argument and the other thing I want to point out was
10021140	10025700	uh sports games do actually have a story I mean you you have to create the story on your
10025700	10030260	own you know just basically using your own imagination kind of like an old D&D tabletop
10030260	10035820	type of a game but um there is story I mean especially I can remember playing uh you know
10035820	10040900	like Madden back in the early 90s when I was in my teens playing Madden right and me and
10040900	10044460	my friends had stories we had rivalries going we had tournaments going you know it was like
10044460	10048540	interesting you know we yeah yeah you know we were playing with a lot of emotion behind
10048540	10051860	those games you know because you know so and so beat my ass last week so now I gotta come
10051860	10055980	back and beat their ass and you know it's it's just a lot of fun to play yeah you don't
10055980	10061540	want to fucking lose yeah exactly yeah all right those are yeah those are my two points
10061540	10065900	awesome well good I think those are fair points I'm waiting on my prize I guess uh you know
10065900	10069940	what happened we got a little slowed down I have it sitting here and Loki has to sign
10069940	10073820	it because we got folks uh he ran out last week before I had a chance to have him sign
10073820	10078260	it but we're hoping to get that out to you Monday or Tuesday so look out for it all right
10078260	10083900	all right thank you all right good night take care buddy bye of course if you weren't listening

10089700	10092900	go back and listen I think it was what two weeks ago here on the show that we talked
10092900	10096420	about the whole uh Child of Eden that came from China that ended up being a bootleg of
10096420	10099940	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and PAL and I said you know what I'm just gonna give this
10099940	10105920	to a listener I don't want it so I'm gonna give it to a listener I guess we could do
10105920	10110100	one more call I'm feeling generous tonight we could do one more quick call so let's go
