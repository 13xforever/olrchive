1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, July 17th, 2011, another company is set to charge for online passes.

2
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:21,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Could an old MMO be coming to the PS Vita?

3
00:00:21,894 --> 00:00:23,817
[SPEAKER_07]: And PopCap Games finds a buyer.

4
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:38,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,431
[SPEAKER_04]: It is July 17th, episode 420 of our show.

6
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:46,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just kind of leave that over there and let the jokes write themselves.

7
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:57,636
[SPEAKER_04]: We are here to talk about video games on the show where every gamer has a voice and you can join us live every week, Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

8
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:10,949
[SPEAKER_04]: www.allgames.com My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you with my co-hosts First off, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers Hey, how's it going, Jamie?

9
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:12,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I'm allergic So wasted

10
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:14,775
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not.

11
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:19,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm high on coffee right now that DarkSakura brewed for me before the show.

12
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:20,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a special blend.

13
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:20,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.

14
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:21,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I make excellent coffee.

15
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:28,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I will tell everybody, it's half hazelnut, half chocolate macadamia, which is decaf.

16
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:28,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And then marijuana.

17
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:29,241
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

18
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:34,943
[SPEAKER_10]: A teaspoon of Hershey's cocoa and a little bit of cinnamon.

19
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:36,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Is coffee going to make me fat?

20
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:37,064
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

21
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:41,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Because keep in mind, cocoa does not really have any sugar in it.

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, okay, alright.

23
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,573
[SPEAKER_10]: This is regular, like, the can of cocoa.

24
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:51,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this an episode of Orange Lawns Radio or am I watching, like, Cooking with Paula Deen?

25
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:53,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you are from the South, after all.

26
00:01:53,877 --> 00:01:53,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

27
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:56,238
[SPEAKER_03]: That woman is frightening.

28
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:58,599
[SPEAKER_03]: This woman... What's your problem with Paula Deen?

29
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,840
[SPEAKER_03]: They photoshop her anyway.

30
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,761
[SPEAKER_03]: They just, she just likes butter.

31
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,084
[SPEAKER_10]: No, okay, look at every magazine cover and advertisement that she's on.

32
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:06,885
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always...

33
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:09,946
[SPEAKER_10]: This one, same smile.

34
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:13,707
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like they take different pictures of her and just plaster the same face on her in Photoshop.

35
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:18,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking through my Facebook pictures not that long ago and I had kind of a similar smile in a lot of my pictures.

36
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I tend to do that whole like, what?

37
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,310
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're not Photoshopped.

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,150
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right, I'm not Photoshopped.

39
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,070
[SPEAKER_04]: To look like that.

40
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:24,311
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

41
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:25,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm naturally that beautiful.

42
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:26,872
[SPEAKER_10]: She looks like a wax sculpture.

43
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:31,453
[SPEAKER_04]: She looks like she belongs in, what is it, Madame Trousseau's House of Wax or whatever.

44
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:32,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

45
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:34,314
[SPEAKER_04]: But her sculpture would be made out of butter.

46
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:35,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe butter is a good preservative.

47
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:40,429
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, look, we gotta also say hello to the one and only Techmaster, Loki!

48
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:41,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

49
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know Loki knows a thing or two about cooking with butter.

50
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's the best way to go.

51
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:47,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

52
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:49,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So how are you, Loki?

53
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:50,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine.

54
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:51,755
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your dinner of choice tonight?

55
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:52,756
[SPEAKER_04]: The listeners are dying to know.

56
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:53,716
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pepperoni pizza.

57
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:55,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Pepperoni pizza, good times.

58
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:56,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I ate some.

59
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:57,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It was good.

60
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:05,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just craving pizza the other day because, well, we were talking about pizza and I was like, hmm, I want pizza.

61
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:26,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to our chat room at chat.orangelandreda.com You guys can always join us and have your say in what's going on on this program Starting off with Breakman tonight Obviously the chatters are making their own little jokes about this being episode 420 And Breakman says, most podcasts don't last this many episodes You know, not to sound cocky, but you're right, a lot don't I mean, granted

62
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,388
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

63
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:47,778
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely some that have made it there.

64
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Any show that can get past 50 is a great accomplishment, if you ask me.

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes dedication to get that far daily, weekly, no matter what you are.

66
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,501
[SPEAKER_04]: We're happy to be here.

67
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:05,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for joining us in chat every week, as you always do, whether you're high or not, to be listening to this program.

68
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:07,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for always supporting us.

69
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:09,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a wonderful, wonderful feeling.

70
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:17,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still having some warm fuzzies coming off of Under Sedation Live, which is another program here at All Games Radio on Saturday nights.

71
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:21,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a guest on their 10th anniversary special, which aired last night.

72
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:25,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those that don't know, that was a show I was on before Orange Lounge Radio.

73
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:27,208
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura was a guest many, many times.

74
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:30,469
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go back and check out the archives of that show over at their website.

75
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:34,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it was a lot of fun to just sit in on that, just like good times.

76
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And some folks that were listening to it said...

77
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:36,611
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

78
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:08,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I played WoW but really only to do my dailies.

79
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:13,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Two more days and I'll be at another 150 marks in the damn world tree.

80
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,812
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the whole new Fireland patch they put in that gave some good single player content.

81
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:20,613
[SPEAKER_10]: One item level away from being able to do Firelands.

82
00:05:20,814 --> 00:05:21,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

83
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:26,257
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully I can get one more good purple item and I'll be there.

84
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:31,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I also played a lot of Peggle on my iPhone.

85
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:41,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Just out of pure boredom and that, and every so often when I need something brainless to do, I play Peggle I also, what was it I was playing on Steam?

86
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:55,574
[SPEAKER_10]: I was playing actually some more Droplets Because it's, again, another thing that I can kind of not really think about while I play And I'm not really all that great at it anyway, but it's kind of fun And then I played, crap, what else was it I was playing?

87
00:05:57,734 --> 00:05:58,134
[SPEAKER_10]: PS2 One is better.

88
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:26,975
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

89
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Are those initial D-games on PS3 kind of faithful to the arcade?

90
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's exactly like the one we have at Golfland.

91
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:53,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have to know a lot of Japanese to play those games?

92
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:54,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

93
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:55,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.

94
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,997
[SPEAKER_10]: However... Because I'm not very good.

95
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there like translations on game FAQs?

96
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Dan has an FAQ and it even has the whole story mode translated and everything.

97
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:05,902
[SPEAKER_10]: But when he got it, he didn't have any of that.

98
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:13,307
[SPEAKER_10]: And thankfully, I could read just enough of it that I could say, okay, this one means you want to replay this.

99
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:15,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you had a couple years of Japanese in college, right?

100
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:18,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I had just enough.

101
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:27,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I read like a retarded five-year-old in Japanese, so I had just enough in me that I could say, okay, that's what that says, that's what that says.

102
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:38,512
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we sort of figured out, because I could read like half of some of the kanji in the tracks, so I was like, okay, that one's Irohazaka, that one's, you know, Akina, that one, so...

103
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:41,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to say this in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

104
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:45,278
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Dark Tetsuya's in there saying, Rob, you mean Eurobeat?

105
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I called it techno.

106
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:51,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, the thing about Initial D especially is it has a very unique style of music that plays in the background.

107
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:53,865
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've never heard Initial D music before, it sounds something like this.

108
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:00,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that make you want to run over people?

109
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:04,822
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been in the car with me, driving to L.A.

110
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:08,527
[SPEAKER_04]: While you're going 105 miles an hour, it is frightening.

111
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:09,468
[SPEAKER_10]: In my old Lancer?

112
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now we had Dan driving, and guess what he wanted to listen to?

113
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:14,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Eurobeat.

114
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:17,459
[SPEAKER_04]: There is something about Eurobeat that makes you go faster.

115
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:18,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Emo Para Emo Para?

116
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:19,363
[SPEAKER_10]: That's goth dancing.

117
00:08:19,383 --> 00:08:20,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, but Para...

118
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:44,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Now see, I'm a little partial to the music in Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune because it's not really Eurobeat.

119
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:48,434
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more like just, I don't know what you, techno.

120
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:49,694
[SPEAKER_04]: It's racing music.

121
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:51,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It just makes me want to drive fast.

122
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:52,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to this.

123
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:57,277
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what my song in that game is?

124
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:58,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, kind of trance.

125
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:01,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it Destination Blackout?

126
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Or that's another Carpool song.

127
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:03,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

128
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Then of course there's F-Zero music.

129
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:06,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God.

130
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:08,953
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I miss F-Zero so much.

131
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:10,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo, why do you hate me?

132
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:14,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I have just loaded you up with old school Bimani Rob.

133
00:09:15,058 --> 00:09:15,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

134
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:18,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Including some Parapara.

135
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:20,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be skipping that folder.

136
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:24,085
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I put in like a few songs, but I'll also give you some poppin' music stuff.

137
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,467
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can get your Desro on.

138
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I never got into the poppin' music soundtracks.

139
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,491
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fun to drive to Desro.

140
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:33,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take your word for it.

141
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:34,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, any other games you've been playing this week?

142
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:38,970
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing, apparently I've been playing Kick Dan in his sleep.

143
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:42,328
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you earn points in that game?

144
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoever wakes up with the most bruises, I don't know.

145
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,631
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

146
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:47,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and I swam.

147
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:49,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I went outside.

148
00:09:49,593 --> 00:09:50,914
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a game, Loki.

149
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:53,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, especially going outside.

150
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,497
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely not a game.

151
00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:57,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I played just basically two things.

152
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto, you know, typical stuff.

153
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:07,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Still playing through ranked death matches and the Battle of Gay Tony and kind of getting back in the groove of that.

154
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And that didn't take me long.

155
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:13,429
[SPEAKER_05]: and I've already got all my co-workers very frustrated at me.

156
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:20,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I, of course, played a little bit of Earth Defense Horse Insect Armageddon because it's just awesome.

157
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:22,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Still kind of grinding my way through that.

158
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:26,055
[SPEAKER_04]: How long is that game?

159
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:30,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you beat it in a few hours or is it a long story?

160
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:30,477
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not very long.

161
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,939
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot less missions than the first game.

162
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,121
[SPEAKER_05]: The first game had these really stupid missions that kind of repeated themselves almost.

163
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:39,201
[SPEAKER_05]: They had like 70 missions.

164
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:39,641
[SPEAKER_05]: This one has 15.

165
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:42,662
[SPEAKER_05]: But each mission is much longer.

166
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:47,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember how long it took me to beat it, but it wasn't that long.

167
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:51,143
[SPEAKER_05]: You could probably beat it in 10 hours.

168
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:53,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, not even 10 hours.

169
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:54,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably a lot less than that.

170
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:56,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy crap.

171
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:57,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what folder I just found.

172
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:59,405
[SPEAKER_10]: All of Loki's old mixes.

173
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, all the remixes he used to do.

174
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:03,365
[SPEAKER_04]: He hasn't made a mix in years.

175
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:06,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we don't want to deviate too much from games right now.

176
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:07,126
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's all right.

177
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:33,998
[SPEAKER_04]: and then yeah so that's basically it was just playing those sweet yeah my gaming week let's see games I've been playing this week I'm still playing Final Fantasy 13 making my way through that I finally beat chapter 11 which I find is the point where most people say this game is awesome or a lot of my friends kind of got to chapter 11 and they're like this game opened up way too much and now some of the monsters can actually kill me I quit but

178
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:37,099
[SPEAKER_04]: But I found Chapter 11 to be great.

179
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:45,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And the trick is, folks, if you're stuck on Chapter 11, don't feel like it's like the rest of the game where you have to fight every monster you come in contact with.

180
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:49,543
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, many are better left avoided until you way level up your characters.

181
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:55,244
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of those Seath side quests that you can do, you really shouldn't do until towards the end of the game.

182
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:58,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of comparable to Emerald Weapon from Final Fantasy VII.

183
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:00,946
[SPEAKER_04]: You really weren't supposed to do that until after the end.

184
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:02,487
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

185
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:26,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that was a badass cinematic.

186
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:26,822
[SPEAKER_04]: They kicked off Chapter 12.

187
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:31,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to spoil too much of the story, but you'll figure out pretty quickly who the Eidolons are.

188
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:32,643
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like the Summons.

189
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,164
[SPEAKER_04]: They are all involved in the opening.

190
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:38,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine Summons mixed with a scene out of Tron Legacy.

191
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:42,386
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the opening to Chapter 12, and it was so hot.

192
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:44,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to fan myself after it was over.

193
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gotten to that point, but I don't remember.

194
00:12:47,348 --> 00:12:48,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really far in.

195
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:49,228
[SPEAKER_04]: You would remember.

196
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:51,529
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an amazing cutscene.

197
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:53,431
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, now I'm at that point.

198
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:54,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that before the game?

199
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:58,297
[SPEAKER_04]: That's way after it opens up.

200
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:03,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Chapter 11 will take you as long as five chapters did from the Kukui stuff.

201
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:08,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe because I was wasting my time just doing all the side quests because I can.

202
00:13:10,912 --> 00:13:26,626
[SPEAKER_04]: uh yeah so that was uh that was you know Final Fantasy 13 I'm probably poured like 40 hours into that now I know I've been talking about that game even though it's like a year and a half old like the past four weeks but I understand I you know can only put so many hours in in a week and I just recently picked it back up again but I'm hoping in the next couple weeks I'll have it beat

203
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:27,566
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

204
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:50,011
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

205
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:36,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing on the 360, a couple new games that I picked up Best Buy was having a buy one get one sale on Kinect Games So I got a late birthday present from Salacious Pop of Child of Eden Finally got to play that game And Your Self Fitness, I think, is that the Ubisoft fitness game?

206
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:37,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Your Self Fitness, that's what it's called, right?

207
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:41,477
[SPEAKER_04]: The most well received of the Kinect Fitness games is the one we got

208
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,199
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

209
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:04,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

210
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:32,769
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be my own bad, but the game also didn't explain it to me very well how I could really make sure I register that on the beat.

211
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the good thing is you can play with Kinect or controller.

212
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:40,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So after playing it a little bit with Kinect, I switched to the controller and played through a couple stages.

213
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:43,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like the controller responsiveness quite a bit more.

214
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:50,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game itself, it's basically Rez, but I'm going to admit I didn't like the music quite as much.

215
00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:53,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that there's more elements to the game, and I think the game is very...

216
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:55,635
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

217
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:12,847
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

218
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, otherwise, I think as a Kinect game, it's certainly a lot of fun.

219
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:39,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's one I would show people.

220
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:45,937
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that sensitivity, music, firing mechanism thing, I would love if there was like...

221
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:53,396
[SPEAKER_04]: A clicker or something I could hold in my hand while I'm doing it to allow something tangible that's more precise.

222
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:58,139
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't really know how you would do that, and it kind of takes away from what the Kinect is all about.

223
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:03,101
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know how when you're using the Wiimote, you at least still have a button in your hand?

224
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:07,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say it, but I almost think this game might be a little better with the Wii controls.

225
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:09,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes.

226
00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:09,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

227
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:12,106
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was just my thoughts on it.

228
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:15,568
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you would probably want to play the PlayStation 3 version with the move controls.

229
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually.

230
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the move might actually be better for this.

231
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:32,523
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I am very much about I need the precision with a music game, and I don't feel like moving my hand forward or flicking my hand, especially when the Kinect is not a perfect system.

232
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:36,667
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not playing it in the perfect environment, it doesn't recognize you always.

233
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:39,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was some of the problems I had with the other game I played, your self-fitness.

234
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Like...

235
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:47,853
[SPEAKER_05]: But it may work better though now with that new accessory that's coming out, the Kinect Zoom thing from Nyko.

236
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:49,094
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be a little bit better.

237
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:50,074
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be better.

238
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:53,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might, you know, again, at least the Kinect is better than the iToy was.

239
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:56,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the iToy, my God, that technology never worked right.

240
00:17:56,876 --> 00:18:01,098
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel Kinect is like, it's still a step above, but it's got a long way to go.

241
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,322
[SPEAKER_04]: The technology isn't perfect, but these games are still pretty early.

242
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:10,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelunchradio.com, Zether says, I heard that Child of Eden didn't sell good.

243
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:18,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it only sold about 30-some-odd thousand copies, which didn't really even put it in the top 20 of games that were sold last month.

244
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:26,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, maybe Loki knows more about what sales ultimately mean and so forth, but I honestly think what probably scared a lot of people off were these reviews talking about

245
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:29,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 90-minute game, and you're paying $60 for it.

246
00:18:29,783 --> 00:18:35,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping that this game will sell much more when it gets discounted, because I think it's one of the better Kinect games.

247
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:35,926
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a niche game.

248
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:38,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Rez and stuff, that was a niche game.

249
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:44,009
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, it's a niche that we like, but it's a niche game, and that's the problem.

250
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:45,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just like Earth Defense Force.

251
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:46,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Earth Defense Force didn't sell...

252
00:18:47,350 --> 00:19:08,859
[SPEAKER_05]: that great either but if Child of Eden had Britney Spears music in it it was sold 10 times as many copies right it would have been stupid though and then actually no I don't think it would have sold 10 times as many copies I think still people wouldn't give it a chance and even less copies would have been sold because people have been like you know like us but I'm not touching that shit what the hell is this um but yeah like Earth Defense Force it sold uh

253
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:22,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they estimated like 65,000 to 90,000 copies worldwide, which is fine because the launch quantities of that were only about 200,000 per platform.

254
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:24,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're expecting to sell much.

255
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:29,002
[SPEAKER_05]: They know going into it what they're expecting to get out of it.

256
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:31,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And a game like Child of Eden...

257
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:45,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think, development-wise, it didn't cost as much money to put it together as, say, a Modern Warfare game or something like that, where you have to sell a lot more to make up the money.

258
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:46,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

259
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:50,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that they had really huge expectations for it.

260
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:50,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, true, true.

261
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:51,528
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point.

262
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:55,730
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll quickly talk about the fitness game I played.

263
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Your Shape Fitness, Your Self Fitness, I don't know, one of those fitness games.

264
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:00,413
[SPEAKER_04]: The one from Ubisoft.

265
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:08,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really liked the idea of the whole tailored custom to you individual workout thing.

266
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked that.

267
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:10,059
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

268
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like how the Kinect, again, doesn't really recognize you 100% of what you're doing.

269
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:22,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this game grades you pretty rigidly on the exercises you're doing.

270
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:30,325
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not perfect within the box that it has, and your arms go way too out, you don't get credit for stuff.

271
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:34,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And it can be very frustrating, especially when the exercises are kind of kicking your butt a little bit.

272
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:36,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It was having me do these squats.

273
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:59,089
[SPEAKER_04]: and the other thing I'm going to actually say I thought was terrible about this I truly think it was a bad decision to do this in a fitness game is when it was doing the calibration stages and having me warm up it did not start with a stretch activity and I think that is a very poor thing to do in a fitness game actually you want to warm up before you stretch

274
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:01,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

275
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, actually yes.

276
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:07,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you have to warm up the muscles before you stretch or else you run a risk of pulling a muscle.

277
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:18,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you saw what this game was doing though, some of the high intensity exercises it was doing, it's one thing to put a little flash card up on the screen saying, you should stretch before using this device.

278
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:26,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly think a smarter little thing would have said, okay, let's do some swaying in place, a little jogging.

279
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:28,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to stretch.

280
00:21:29,228 --> 00:21:31,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to have you do the intensive squats and so forth.

281
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:33,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they have a stretching portion at all?

282
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:39,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I ran into, but keep in mind this game kind of kicked my butt before I got very far into it.

283
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:41,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see it.

284
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:46,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sore in my legs for four days since playing, and it's because Stupid Me didn't stretch beforehand.

285
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:52,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was a little bit upset that the game should have... I mean, I should have known better, yes.

286
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to totally blame the game, but I just think it was a bad idea to...

287
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:58,822
[SPEAKER_04]: to not encourage me more.

288
00:21:58,902 --> 00:21:59,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Remind me.

289
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:00,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, stupid.

290
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:03,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everyone knows that you need to stretch beforehand.

291
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:13,748
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't think it was going to throw me so far into it with the calibration where I'm doing some squatting and things that are going to hurt my legs before telling me, hey, maybe we should do some yoga first.

292
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:14,868
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

293
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:41,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, and again, I want to clarify before, because this might show up later in the game, so I want to be very careful on what I'm saying.

294
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:51,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going through an initial setup calibration mode, but it was having you do exercises as part of the calibration, like a full routine type of thing, and it did not have me stretch beforehand, nor did no reminder come up at any point.

295
00:22:52,381 --> 00:23:00,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, maybe after the calibration, when you get into the actual daily stuff, you'll see more of that, but I'm not going to, if I didn't see it beforehand...

296
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:03,146
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

297
00:23:19,594 --> 00:23:25,720
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes all the difference with how well you can keep up with the exercises too if you've given your chance to warm up and then stretch.

298
00:23:27,462 --> 00:23:31,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this comment from Kai Judo in our chat room.

299
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:33,409
[SPEAKER_04]: You do the stretch when you try to get the game out of the shrink wrap.

300
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:35,958
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

301
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:38,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those shrink wraps are pretty terrible.

302
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,020
[SPEAKER_04]: But my arms don't hurt.

303
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my legs.

304
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:43,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you guys, for real.

305
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:44,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sad.

306
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:45,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm a teacher, right?

307
00:23:46,443 --> 00:23:48,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a kid teacher, but an adult teacher.

308
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I teach in a corporate environment.

309
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:57,187
[SPEAKER_04]: But I use classrooms full of computers, and I walk around and look at adults on their systems all day long, making sure they're following with me and so forth.

310
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,507
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to walk around the room.

311
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:02,849
[SPEAKER_04]: The day after I did this Connect exercise, I couldn't walk as much.

312
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:04,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm having to explain to my class,

313
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry guys, I was playing Kinect yesterday and you know, those things are pretty rough.

314
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:11,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how embarrassing is that?

315
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:14,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Fool, you should have known to stretch.

316
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:17,499
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it used to happen to me when I would go play DDR on my lunch break.

317
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,661
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd come back, my knees hurt.

318
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I had to... Walking upstairs was not a problem.

319
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:26,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Walking downstairs, oh my gosh.

320
00:24:26,283 --> 00:24:30,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like a little old lady clutching to that railing.

321
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:32,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have used the elevator.

322
00:24:32,486 --> 00:24:34,507
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like you're doing squats all over again.

323
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:36,628
[SPEAKER_10]: It's easier to lift it than to drop to it.

324
00:24:36,748 --> 00:24:37,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It was traumatic.

325
00:24:38,449 --> 00:24:38,629
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

326
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:45,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to give up and I'm not going to say a lot of negative things about the game because of that one thing.

327
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:51,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll know next time to stretch, but I really think the game should have incorporated it better.

328
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:57,829
[SPEAKER_04]: If I missed it, and I consider myself a pretty smart individual, if I missed it, who knows who else is missing this and hurting themselves.

329
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,670
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not about that.

330
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

331
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:07,872
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually something that came up in my video game week that I didn't get to play because of a certain something.

332
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

333
00:25:09,152 --> 00:25:09,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

334
00:25:10,012 --> 00:25:10,612
[SPEAKER_10]: It just occurred to me.

335
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:11,132
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

336
00:25:11,152 --> 00:25:12,553
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the last game I wanted to talk about.

337
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:16,973
[SPEAKER_10]: The arcade that had Parapara Paradise is out of business.

338
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:22,095
[SPEAKER_10]: The Arcadia budding games or whatever it's called, the kind of crappy ghetto.

339
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:23,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the little crappy, yeah.

340
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,835
[SPEAKER_10]: But they had the Parapara machine.

341
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised at all they went out of business.

342
00:25:26,756 --> 00:25:27,196
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gone.

343
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It really was a matter of time.

344
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:32,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to go play Parapara because I don't have Dance Masters.

345
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:34,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Their location really was never that good.

346
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,982
[SPEAKER_04]: But we should buy that place and open up the actual Orange Lounge arcade in batting cages.

347
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:41,683
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be great.

348
00:25:41,703 --> 00:25:42,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet it's dirt cheap.

349
00:25:43,484 --> 00:25:48,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungevideo.com Derek H is in our chatroom saying, Rob is correct.

350
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:53,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Even Carmen Electra's aerobic striptease workout DVDs have an extensive stretching section.

351
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:54,590
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

352
00:25:55,432 --> 00:26:01,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if your pole dancing classes tell you, I don't know why Derek H. knows so much about pole dancing classes, but I'll just assume he does.

353
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if they're getting you to stretch.

354
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:10,826
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that these games need to make sure they are incorporating that into their customized workouts.

355
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:11,586
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

356
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:14,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on.

357
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:15,369
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for our Gaming Weeks.

358
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:16,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly, housekeeping.

359
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you follow us on all those great websites around the interwebs.

360
00:26:19,252 --> 00:26:23,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR or Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

361
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,457
[SPEAKER_04]: They kick businesses off of Google Plus right now.

362
00:26:27,537 --> 00:26:29,018
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are not on Google Plus.

363
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:30,940
[SPEAKER_04]: You can follow...

364
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,801
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

365
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:52,333
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

366
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:37,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we're starting off with a comment from, uh, one of the Sony Network Entertainment execs, the president, Tim Schaaf, who, uh, spoke to, uh, or spoke at GamesBeat, uh, 2011, uh, about the PlayStation Network downtime.

367
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:38,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said,

368
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:53,360
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just goes to show you, all those people are like, you know, they're done for.

369
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,841
[SPEAKER_05]: They ended up selling a lot more because of this.

370
00:27:59,202 --> 00:28:04,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it says, of course, you know, the downtime cost Sony approximately $171 million.

371
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:08,744
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they would not like to do it again, obviously.

372
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:11,765
[SPEAKER_05]: They said one time was enough, but it was a great learning experience.

373
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:12,206
[SPEAKER_05]: We agree.

374
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:13,326
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

375
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:16,903
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a very interesting choice of words.

376
00:28:17,383 --> 00:28:21,967
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a learning experience, but once is enough.

377
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:26,751
[SPEAKER_04]: If that isn't the most politically correct statement about the whole thing.

378
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:32,596
[SPEAKER_05]: He had to explain a little bit because his first quote was, it was a great experience.

379
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:36,700
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not exactly how you would describe that.

380
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

381
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:40,482
[SPEAKER_05]: A humbling experience might be a little bit better.

382
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:45,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how many times in my day-to-day job I use a phrase like that?

383
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,705
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because people make mistakes all the time.

384
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:49,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's frustrating to make mistakes.

385
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:53,667
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to, especially when you're at your job, you want to do the best job you possibly can.

386
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:54,868
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of times people make mistakes.

387
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a learning experience.

388
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:58,889
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to learn from it.

389
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:00,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And we make mistakes in here.

390
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:00,510
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

391
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,831
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very funny to hear Sony kind of use that same phrase.

392
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:06,206
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a learning experience.

393
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:08,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

394
00:29:08,586 --> 00:29:14,349
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are planning to invest some money to make sure that the PlayStation Network is secure.

395
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:27,833
[SPEAKER_05]: They're committing $20 million, and they're also seeking out independent developers to create games like, you know, PixelJunk, Sidescroller, and the Papoio Boku stuff.

396
00:29:28,614 --> 00:29:30,614
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also saying that they're going to be...

397
00:29:32,956 --> 00:29:49,015
[SPEAKER_05]: doing this pub fun to bring innovative different and unique gameplay to the PlayStation Network so they're kind of trying to beef up their content on there because it could use a little bit of beefing up so that's kind of cool

398
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:56,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm glad they're kind of bringing in all that extra support.

399
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:09,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I think all this talk about how Google was going to go under, or I'm sorry, not Google, excuse me, I'm still thinking about Plus and all that, but how PlayStation was going to go under and all that after the hacking and all that, it seems to be...

400
00:30:11,371 --> 00:30:35,776
[SPEAKER_04]: A distant memory at this point, and I'm looking at a comment in our chatroom from Blender, says Uncharted 3 beta had 1.53 million players, by the way, and I do remember reading about that on the internet earlier this week, and I think a story had said it's the biggest PlayStation beta that's ever happened, so it certainly gives the impression that people have pretty much forgiven Sony, and we've all moved on with our lives, and we're back on PlayStation Network, but

401
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:41,382
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also, I guess, that sense of fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

402
00:30:41,442 --> 00:30:46,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if something bad happens again, I think you'll see a lot of people really mean it this time and leave.

403
00:30:47,384 --> 00:30:49,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, it also helps that, you know, it's Uncharted 3.

404
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:51,506
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge game.

405
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:55,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, it's going to be one of their largest betas they've ever had.

406
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

407
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,440
[SPEAKER_04]: David Reeves said,

408
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:29,557
[SPEAKER_04]: That there is a resurgence in people buying the generic PSN cards in retail stores rather than putting up their credit card details.

409
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:37,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in the future they will make more non-generic cards like game branded ones such as Street Fighter or FIFA or even Modern Warfare.

410
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:39,423
[SPEAKER_04]: But the generic ones have done well.

411
00:31:39,963 --> 00:31:43,085
[SPEAKER_04]: People are playing it a bit safe at the moment because the hackers will be back.

412
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:44,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my personal opinion.

413
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean they will right?

414
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:49,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's really the best thing to be saying there.

415
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:53,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shut up, Capcom.

416
00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:55,912
[SPEAKER_05]: We see that they're buying more generic cards.

417
00:31:56,312 --> 00:32:01,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, hopefully they're not buying your games with your crappy DRM shit.

418
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:07,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, your games didn't work during the whole PlayStation Network outage, or at least your two PlayStation Network games.

419
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:13,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are awfully pretty good spirits to be in when you consider they missed out on all those weeks of sales, you know.

420
00:32:13,922 --> 00:32:16,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised it wasn't.

421
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:20,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, that might be one quote out of a much larger interview, but still.

422
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:24,127
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because they need them more than Sony needs them, you know.

423
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:32,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if they, you know, stop supporting Sony, then their sales kind of get cut about half.

424
00:32:33,531 --> 00:32:36,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas if Sony loses them, eh, there's

425
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:38,213
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't really wanted anything else, but Dan got the freebies.

426
00:33:01,058 --> 00:33:01,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got the freebies.

427
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:03,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I've bought anything on PSN.

428
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:11,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I try not to buy anything on there, not because I'm afraid of my credit card information being hacked, but because I don't want to spend money on their network.

429
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:14,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And that goes for Microsoft, too.

430
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:22,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really want to buy anything, because I got into the habit where, oh, I gotta buy all the Xbox Live Arcade games, and I did that for a while, and

431
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:25,994
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of them do I play now?

432
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:29,196
[SPEAKER_05]: None of them.

433
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:36,139
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing I bought on there, I think, was the Pirates of the Caribbean expansion for LittleBigPlanet.

434
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,881
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the last thing that I purchased on there.

435
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:43,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I don't see myself really purchasing anything else for there.

436
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:44,904
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

437
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:48,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

438
00:33:49,978 --> 00:33:54,281
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm going to purchase download content for something, most of the time I'm gaming on my 360 anyway.

439
00:33:56,642 --> 00:34:13,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've bought anything since the hack happened, but I will say that Salacious Pop is strongly encouraging me to get the Arcade Super Street Fighter Arcade Edition expansion there on PlayStation Network because that's where we own Super Street Fighter 4.

440
00:34:14,174 --> 00:34:15,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I may have to buy something in the near future.

441
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:16,035
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

442
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:19,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on.

443
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:20,017
[SPEAKER_04]: One more gaming news.

444
00:34:20,077 --> 00:34:21,238
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

445
00:34:22,298 --> 00:34:24,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I have some Ubisoft news.

446
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:29,421
[SPEAKER_10]: They have confirmed that there is going to be an online pass to be used for its games.

447
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:31,202
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called the Uplay Passport.

448
00:34:31,842 --> 00:34:41,247
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's $9.99, basically $10 for access to the online features of many of their core games when bought second-hand.

449
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:49,795
[SPEAKER_10]: So, if you bought the game, you have a registration code that comes in it and it has exclusive bonus content and whatnot.

450
00:34:50,216 --> 00:34:52,919
[SPEAKER_10]: But the first game that's going to be using this is Driver San Francisco.

451
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,021
[SPEAKER_10]: No UK price yet.

452
00:34:58,465 --> 00:34:58,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

453
00:34:59,186 --> 00:35:01,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Loki, aren't you excited to hear about this?

454
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:08,316
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's just another company jumping on this horrible bandwagon, and I don't see the point.

455
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:18,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was trying to find... There was another article that actually had their press release for that in there, and I really want to find that so that I can... Oh, here we go.

456
00:35:19,381 --> 00:35:22,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can read you their PR spin on this, and it's just...

457
00:35:24,564 --> 00:35:25,865
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what gamers want.

458
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:32,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamers want that premium experience that their $10 goes to help.

459
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:36,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

460
00:35:36,715 --> 00:35:39,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to find... God, I really wish I had it.

461
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:51,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they spun it as, it allows us, it's extra content, like online multiplayer and stuff like that.

462
00:35:52,517 --> 00:36:06,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, if I'm buying a game that has online multiplayer in it, and that does, because it does brand new, so therefore it should use, I don't understand why I should have to pay extra if I'm buying used.

463
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:10,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I've heard people make, and I gotta say the most...

464
00:36:12,114 --> 00:36:13,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

465
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:31,721
[SPEAKER_05]: All used games start off as new at some point.

466
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:37,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they've made their money for that game to fund that online network.

467
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:44,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to be devil's advocate and give you the counterpoint, but if the game wasn't being sold used, then that would force someone to buy it new.

468
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:46,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily, because some people might not buy it

469
00:36:47,594 --> 00:36:49,096
[SPEAKER_05]: They may just skip it altogether.

470
00:36:49,396 --> 00:36:56,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas if you got a used sale, you may have the chance that other people might enjoy that game and they may later on decide, hey, you know what?

471
00:36:56,703 --> 00:37:01,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go pick up more games from this developer or whatnot.

472
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:08,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of all that, people say that the developer doesn't get money for used sales.

473
00:37:09,113 --> 00:37:13,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it doesn't matter because the developer already got paid when the game got pressed.

474
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they get some kickbacks for sales and stuff like that, but you know what?

475
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:20,027
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter...

476
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:22,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

477
00:37:36,192 --> 00:37:38,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chat room for some comments at chat.orange.com.

478
00:37:38,894 --> 00:37:41,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Sterlok says, cool, more games I'm not buying.

479
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:46,201
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says, they fuck us over and for whatever reason people still step up to defend them.

480
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:49,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, I'm not necessarily defending this here, but I have to...

481
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:56,449
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of this news story I just kind of roll my eyes at and I'm like, I don't care.

482
00:37:56,549 --> 00:37:59,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I really do buy most of my stuff new.

483
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:03,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Like either I'm going to buy it new or I'm going to get it on one of those rental accounts.

484
00:38:03,873 --> 00:38:10,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are very few games that I would play online that I wouldn't just buy new.

485
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:14,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Most games I want to play online with friends I'm excited about and I want to buy them right away.

486
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,341
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're not seeing the writing on the wall, Rob.

487
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,182
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, if you give them an inch, they're going to take a mile.

488
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:27,045
[SPEAKER_05]: If you start thinking that this is an okay thing for them to do, then everybody jumps on board and they start doing this for multiplayer.

489
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:27,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you know what?

490
00:38:27,845 --> 00:38:35,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they start going, hey, you know, we're noticing that it seems that our used game sales or whatever, our new sales, aren't really being impacted enough.

491
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:43,652
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make sure that this is really something that people are going to want to buy new by adding more content for this game.

492
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:44,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

493
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:06,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you can't wait until later on when they're like, oh, well, it doesn't matter because I buy a lot of games new.

494
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:10,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, until they start saying, oh, hey, you know what?

495
00:39:10,772 --> 00:39:16,176
[SPEAKER_05]: We can make a lot more money by charging for online multiplayer by having it download content or something.

496
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:18,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say it does piss me off.

497
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:23,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is interesting because I do kind of have different opinions depending on what system it is.

498
00:39:24,003 --> 00:39:25,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think the PlayStation 3...

499
00:39:26,425 --> 00:39:26,725
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

500
00:39:49,227 --> 00:40:09,356
[SPEAKER_04]: and I refuse to support it on Xbox and I will take Microsoft to task for that because Microsoft's allowing it to happen by selling it on their store and I'm sorry that's double dipping you're charging me twice for the same thing and that is to play my game online so I honestly think the company that needs to put their foot down is Microsoft Sony

501
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:25,770
[SPEAKER_04]: they're providing a free service it's harder to get mad at them on that side because you aren't paying for online over there the whole infrastructure is free and to say that to charge $10 for maintenance you can get away with that a lot more on that end than you can on Microsoft's end

502
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:26,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Outro Music

503
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,525
[SPEAKER_10]: For the record, just because Eason wanted to hear it.

504
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:51,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

505
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:51,985
[SPEAKER_10]: OBJECTION!

506
00:40:52,905 --> 00:41:04,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and then, I mean, it's like I've said before, and you know, no one seemed to care then, and it's happening more now, and yeah, it doesn't really bother me too much because I don't buy Wii games, but...

507
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:18,513
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of Wii games out there nowadays that, you know, maybe music games, maybe, you know, I don't know, just some other type of game, but where they're charging $60 for it.

508
00:41:18,773 --> 00:41:19,553
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's saying anything.

509
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:20,193
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what?

510
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:22,094
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that's now commonly happening.

511
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:36,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, like, for example, and, I mean, not that, this is definitely not a game I'm buying, but, you know, like, that Spyro fucking game that's coming out, the, the new Spyro Skylanders Adventure bullshit thing, that they're selling some S-

512
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:39,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

513
00:41:58,132 --> 00:41:58,712
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

514
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:21,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, those horrid things.

515
00:42:21,828 --> 00:42:22,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I know.

516
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:27,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, kids are starting out stupid early on, and they just become stupid adults.

517
00:42:28,074 --> 00:42:28,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

518
00:42:28,314 --> 00:42:29,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope Richard Gere doesn't own a Zuzu.

519
00:42:33,322 --> 00:42:34,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

520
00:42:34,723 --> 00:42:37,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's just dumb.

521
00:42:37,525 --> 00:42:43,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're trying all these different tactics to get money for things they really shouldn't be getting money for.

522
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Developers getting money for used games?

523
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:46,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck it.

524
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:47,573
[SPEAKER_05]: You shouldn't get money for used games.

525
00:42:48,514 --> 00:42:48,894
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

526
00:42:49,055 --> 00:42:49,695
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a market.

527
00:42:50,055 --> 00:42:52,998
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a market that was created by people.

528
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:54,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't even have to be necessarily that.

529
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say, for example, Rob, I loan you a copy of my game and you want to play it online.

530
00:42:59,623 --> 00:43:00,063
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't.

531
00:43:00,103 --> 00:43:00,824
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to pay $10 now.

532
00:43:00,864 --> 00:43:01,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

533
00:43:03,703 --> 00:43:03,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

534
00:43:04,404 --> 00:43:07,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, because it's someone else accessing their network.

535
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:10,751
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've already paid for that on Xbox Live.

536
00:43:11,011 --> 00:43:11,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

537
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:13,014
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

538
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,298
[SPEAKER_04]: They just use the more subscription model based thing.

539
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,580
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm telling you, I've been an Xbox Live member for like six, seven years.

540
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,161
[SPEAKER_04]: If they allow this shit to continue, I'm out.

541
00:43:22,921 --> 00:43:23,982
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

542
00:43:24,022 --> 00:43:27,023
[SPEAKER_04]: There will come a point probably where there's a game I'm going to want to play online.

543
00:43:27,043 --> 00:43:30,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be pissed that I'm double dipping and I'm canceling Xbox Live when that happens.

544
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:36,507
[SPEAKER_05]: If Sony is doing it, if Ubisoft is doing it, EA is doing it, THQ is doing it, Warner Games is doing it...

545
00:43:39,873 --> 00:43:44,755
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be long before everybody jumps on board with this, and hopefully not Microsoft.

546
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:46,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting comment from Ranma.

547
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:47,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay.

548
00:43:48,536 --> 00:43:53,138
[SPEAKER_04]: If Microsoft did it, now they need to be called out if that happens.

549
00:43:53,418 --> 00:43:53,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

550
00:43:54,038 --> 00:43:54,538
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

551
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:56,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma in our chatroom at chat.org.com.

552
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:00,840
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're patient enough, you can buy the games as new when the price drops.

553
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that serious to get the game on day one.

554
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:08,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather wait a few weeks for the game to drop to 30, 40 new than wait a week and buy it used for 45, 50.

555
00:44:09,463 --> 00:44:10,024
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

556
00:44:24,188 --> 00:44:29,211
[SPEAKER_05]: That is technically a way to get it cheaper, but people want their games right away.

557
00:44:29,472 --> 00:44:34,315
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, the way I look at it is if you're buying it used anyways, you're probably not getting it day one anyways.

558
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So just wait even longer.

559
00:44:36,496 --> 00:44:39,959
[SPEAKER_05]: In a game like Driver, I mean, let's look at Driver.

560
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:42,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the pedigree of Driver hasn't been that great.

561
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:43,921
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one was great.

562
00:44:44,302 --> 00:44:45,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Second one was alright.

563
00:44:45,622 --> 00:44:46,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Third one was terrible.

564
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:50,025
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one, eh, kind of terrible as well.

565
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:53,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fifth one, eh, I wouldn't be surprised if it's terrible.

566
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:57,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's definitely not a game I'd be playing online anyways.

567
00:44:59,695 --> 00:45:06,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on with some other topics here before we make Loki's head explode.

568
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:08,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

569
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:41,229
[SPEAKER_05]: No mention of Final Fantasy XIV That just doesn't exist But Final Fantasy XI Their only online game In the Final Fantasy series Will be Possibly ported to the PlayStation 8 Their only online game?

570
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:43,630
[SPEAKER_04]: in the Final Fantasy series.

571
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:44,450
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

572
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they just totally forget about Final Fantasy XIV?

573
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:50,833
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, that's my comments.

574
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see, I see, okay.

575
00:45:52,693 --> 00:45:53,694
[SPEAKER_05]: XIV doesn't exist.

576
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:54,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

577
00:45:56,055 --> 00:46:06,739
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's just, it's kind of interesting though if they did that, but I think it'd be kind of cool because think about it, you know, MMOs haven't really come to handhelds, so...

578
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:08,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not that I can think of.

579
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe Phantasy Star.

580
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Phantasy Star, maybe.

581
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:15,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, but the Phantasy Star portable games contained little single-player games.

582
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:17,902
[SPEAKER_04]: They were a lot like Universe's single-player mode.

583
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:21,884
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I'd like that.

584
00:46:22,004 --> 00:46:23,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd welcome that, actually.

585
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:26,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear Final Fantasy XI is still going.

586
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,125
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still improving.

587
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:28,766
[SPEAKER_04]: They did graphical improvements.

588
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:33,407
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a PC player, you got some new graphic textures this last go-around.

589
00:46:33,447 --> 00:46:34,808
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's kind of rad.

590
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:50,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's really possible to put XIV on a portable platform because despite the fact that everybody criticizes it for being poop it was a really good looking game and the Vita probably just doesn't possess the power graphically to pull it off.

591
00:46:51,281 --> 00:47:18,579
[SPEAKER_04]: but you know 11 was a game that was made for the PS2 and that's the biggest drawback to 11 is that everything they do on 11 still has to support the PlayStation 2 because a lot of folks in Japan that's how they adopted it was on the PS2 so until there comes a day where they say well we no longer are going to support the old platforms I just don't see them being able to do that I think that's what 14 was trying to do but failed miserably because they didn't make the they tried to change the core game

592
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:28,299
[SPEAKER_04]: and they took out the goddamn auction houses which every MMO like needs so I don't, oh my god and they kept the same races but changed the names that's just stupid

593
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:36,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, I think it's a neat idea to have, especially considering the Vitas are supposed to have 3G in them and everything.

594
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:38,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's kind of a cool use.

595
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:41,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be curious what other types of MMOs come out of this.

596
00:47:41,618 --> 00:47:45,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not just ports of old stuff, but some new ideas.

597
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:50,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially because isn't part of the whole Vitas thing supposed to be finding gamers around you?

598
00:47:51,145 --> 00:47:59,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, you've got GPS built into them and all the different little services that they have and stuff.

599
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:00,843
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

600
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:29,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it just sounds like a neat thing to kind of integrate the GPS stuff into MMOs somehow.

601
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:30,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

602
00:48:31,882 --> 00:48:38,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Spazinator says, Final Fantasy XI would be a system seller.

603
00:48:38,243 --> 00:48:39,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to love it on the PlayStation 2.

604
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw says, MMOs on a PlayStation Vita.

605
00:48:43,725 --> 00:48:49,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I sense you can do some sort of transferring type of stuff from the PlayStation 3 to the Vita with MMOs.

606
00:48:50,306 --> 00:48:54,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very hard to play Final Fantasy XI on a PlayStation 3.

607
00:48:54,949 --> 00:49:02,034
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do it, but you have to have the exact right model of PlayStation in order to be able to play it.

608
00:49:02,054 --> 00:49:02,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

609
00:49:03,795 --> 00:49:05,717
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even just the backward compatible ones.

610
00:49:05,837 --> 00:49:13,062
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one that has some type of port that the hard drive attaches to because I don't think you can use PlayStation 3's hard drive.

611
00:49:13,422 --> 00:49:14,482
[SPEAKER_04]: For 11, can you?

612
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:37,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember No, you can't at all because it's a 3.5 drive versus a laptop SATA drive And it's an old IDE drive So you would have to clone Well, I think they had something that you could download off the PlayStation Network That was basically the cloned hard drive information, I think, for the Final Fantasy XI stuff

613
00:49:39,178 --> 00:49:41,640
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a curious comment from Spazinator in our chatroom.

614
00:49:57,413 --> 00:50:02,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the Vita launch games really that bad looking so far?

615
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:05,040
[SPEAKER_04]: How old is Final Fantasy XI?

616
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,541
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about as old as this show, isn't it?

617
00:50:06,561 --> 00:50:09,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it came out in 2002 in Japan, right?

618
00:50:09,124 --> 00:50:09,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

619
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:10,825
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nine-year-old game.

620
00:50:10,945 --> 00:50:11,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it this way.

621
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:16,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Launch titles right now are pretty sparse.

622
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:20,711
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't really said what they're launching with yet.

623
00:50:21,491 --> 00:50:22,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than Uncharted.

624
00:50:23,132 --> 00:50:24,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Uncharted is a big title for them.

625
00:50:25,173 --> 00:50:25,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

626
00:50:25,473 --> 00:50:29,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was that neat looking dungeon game with the whole PlayStation 3 integration I thought was neat.

627
00:50:32,577 --> 00:50:33,297
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's about it.

628
00:50:33,317 --> 00:50:36,119
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't really said yet what a lot of launch games are going to be.

629
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:37,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still really early, I think.

630
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:38,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

631
00:50:39,482 --> 00:50:40,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Vita, Naughty Dog, Crash Bandicoot

632
00:51:00,663 --> 00:51:21,284
[SPEAKER_04]: But saying a pretty big slam that's pro-Sony and anti-Nintendo In an interview with Now Gamer, Justin Richman said To be honest with you, the idea of it is very, very cool Speaking about the Wii U But there's nothing that the Wii U has that the Vita and PlayStation 3 doesn't You know, it's an interesting piece of technology And I'm interested to see how people use it

633
00:51:21,764 --> 00:51:22,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not completely sold yet.

634
00:51:23,226 --> 00:51:25,650
[SPEAKER_04]: That the screen isn't multi-touch, that's a little weird.

635
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:31,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems that there are some very strange holes in it, but to be fair, last time I was skeptical of the original Wii, and look at how that did.

636
00:51:32,078 --> 00:51:35,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure the games they make for Wii U will be amazing."

637
00:51:36,044 --> 00:51:49,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, I'm seeing that whole observation in the mainstream media that, hell, not even the Vita, but the PSP in the PlayStation 3 was kind of capable of that same technology of having a portable screen in your hand.

638
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:51,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And he brings up a point I forgot.

639
00:51:51,334 --> 00:51:52,675
[SPEAKER_04]: The Vita has a touchscreen.

640
00:51:53,055 --> 00:52:03,342
[SPEAKER_04]: It is going to be just like the Wii U. I mean, granted, it'll be between a PlayStation 3 and a Vita way more expensive than a Wii U most likely will be, but he's got a good point.

641
00:52:04,022 --> 00:52:04,902
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

642
00:52:31,154 --> 00:52:32,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, you're right.

643
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:37,918
[SPEAKER_04]: The ports would be a little weird on the Sony end, but you know... It'd be like something like, here's some really optional way to play this.

644
00:52:38,058 --> 00:52:42,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not like right away, but what about further down the line?

645
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:46,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what about a game like, I don't know, Arkham Asylum is supposed to be on the Wii U, right?

646
00:52:46,443 --> 00:52:47,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So... That's retarded.

647
00:52:48,144 --> 00:52:48,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

648
00:52:48,725 --> 00:52:51,066
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be out on the Wii U a year after it comes out.

649
00:52:51,306 --> 00:52:52,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome!

650
00:52:53,047 --> 00:52:57,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it'll have some stinking bonus feature, something that everybody has to have.

651
00:52:57,428 --> 00:53:10,770
[SPEAKER_04]: But my curiosity is, couldn't they release a similar game of the year edition, quote unquote, on the PlayStation 3 that could optionally bring up the Vita to do whatever the Wii U screen is doing?

652
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:19,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it could, but people would just shrug their shoulders and say, I'm not buying another fucking $299 system so that I can do this.

653
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,561
[SPEAKER_04]: True, but I don't know.

654
00:53:24,161 --> 00:53:28,024
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's an optional and not a mandatory enhancement, does that make sense?

655
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:36,031
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be like if Gran Turismo 5 was coming out, say, next year, and you could buy the Vita and use it as a rear-view mirror.

656
00:53:37,652 --> 00:53:38,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Would someone do that?

657
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:40,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, I'm sure there's someone out there that would do that.

658
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:44,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is what they had showed off that the PS3 was supposed to do in 2006.

659
00:53:44,397 --> 00:53:46,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, is that necessarily a good use of your $299?

660
00:53:46,939 --> 00:53:47,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

661
00:53:52,565 --> 00:54:03,810
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens when the games get a little closer to coming out for the Wii U and when the Vita comes out, exactly what types of technology we see beyond what we've just seen at E3.

662
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:04,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

663
00:54:05,611 --> 00:54:10,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there is a dream come true for many, many people in West Virginia.

664
00:54:11,693 --> 00:54:13,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, first of all, I will rewind.

665
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:15,995
[SPEAKER_04]: People stop making jokes about West Virginia?

666
00:54:16,015 --> 00:54:16,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

667
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, we're in West Virginia.

668
00:54:18,771 --> 00:54:24,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, Konami is going to have the Childhood Obesity Summit in West Virginia this month.

669
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:28,594
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they're going to have a DDR tournament for school-aged children in West Virginia.

670
00:54:29,074 --> 00:54:31,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear that's going to be a cool summit, except there's going to be a lot of fatties.

671
00:54:32,655 --> 00:54:33,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

672
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:34,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

673
00:54:37,392 --> 00:54:46,618
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, it's going to be held July 27th and 28th in Charleston, and it will have representatives from the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, the U.S.

674
00:54:46,638 --> 00:55:00,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Michael Danzinger from The Biggest Loser, and they will also have the West Virginia University Extension Service and West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency hosting it.

675
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:11,338
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be prizes, mainly scholarships, and they're hoping that they can just get kids more active.

676
00:55:11,758 --> 00:55:16,762
[SPEAKER_04]: There will also be a technician on hand to maintain the DDR pads as they keep breaking.

677
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:17,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope.

678
00:55:18,644 --> 00:55:19,445
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about?

679
00:55:19,485 --> 00:55:20,326
[SPEAKER_05]: This is DDR.

680
00:55:20,366 --> 00:55:23,869
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be no technician to tech those pads.

681
00:55:24,109 --> 00:55:25,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a good idea.

682
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:28,107
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I had DDR at my gym.

683
00:55:28,707 --> 00:55:32,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that gets kids motivated to exercise is a good thing, I think.

684
00:55:33,213 --> 00:55:34,534
[SPEAKER_04]: We shouldn't be making fun of it.

685
00:55:34,595 --> 00:55:42,524
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to admit, the idea of an obesity summit, doesn't that seem the slightest bit condescending to you?

686
00:55:44,086 --> 00:55:44,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Well...

687
00:55:46,536 --> 00:55:48,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, anything that gets more DDR machines out there.

688
00:55:48,957 --> 00:55:50,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's all I'm saying.

689
00:55:50,938 --> 00:55:53,899
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like the parents telling the kids, you're going to summer camp.

690
00:55:53,979 --> 00:55:54,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

691
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,020
[SPEAKER_04]: What camp are we going to?

692
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:57,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Camp Thin and Beautiful.

693
00:55:58,962 --> 00:55:59,502
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

694
00:56:00,102 --> 00:56:03,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I really think that it's a good start.

695
00:56:03,684 --> 00:56:05,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a good thing.

696
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:09,647
[SPEAKER_10]: But really, a lot of it is going to start with parental education.

697
00:56:10,307 --> 00:56:12,108
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to look at what the influences are on the kid.

698
00:56:12,348 --> 00:56:12,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

699
00:56:15,347 --> 00:56:22,452
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy all the DDR you want, but at the end of the day, it has to be the parent that says, no, you can't have a donut until you have mowed the lawn, or whatever.

700
00:56:23,152 --> 00:56:24,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Or eat your vegetables first.

701
00:56:24,773 --> 00:56:24,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

702
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:25,594
[SPEAKER_10]: You know.

703
00:56:27,975 --> 00:56:28,235
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

704
00:56:28,715 --> 00:56:31,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see what comes of that, and we'll let you know.

705
00:56:31,797 --> 00:56:36,160
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let you know how big of a score the winner of the DDR tournament racks up.

706
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:38,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to, sorry.

707
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:42,064
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's travel the world and look at some upcoming release dates and games that are coming out soon.

708
00:56:42,698 --> 00:56:44,020
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a whole lot this week.

709
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:50,328
[SPEAKER_05]: This week it's basically Call of Juarez the Cartel on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

710
00:56:51,609 --> 00:57:01,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Also Captain America Super Soldier that's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS, and actually that's it.

711
00:57:02,562 --> 00:57:08,564
[SPEAKER_05]: and then also the Smurfs, in case you forgot.

712
00:57:09,924 --> 00:57:11,084
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a movie coming out.

713
00:57:11,465 --> 00:57:13,205
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the Smurfs on the DS.

714
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:24,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And because Ubisoft loves their dancing games, Smurfs Dance Party, which I saw a YouTube clip out there with one of the Smurfs songs.

715
00:57:24,948 --> 00:57:25,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Who let the Smurfs out?

716
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to stab a needle into my ear.

717
00:57:29,409 --> 00:57:30,910
[SPEAKER_05]: It seriously was terrible.

718
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:38,492
[SPEAKER_05]: and I also believe that just Dance Summer Party will be coming out as well on the Wii.

719
00:57:39,233 --> 00:57:39,653
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

720
00:57:41,113 --> 00:57:47,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, do you know what I have stuck in my head thanks to the whole talk about going to fat camp and going to summer camp?

721
00:57:47,895 --> 00:57:49,076
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I have stuck in my head now?

722
00:57:51,577 --> 00:57:55,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to salute your shorts?

723
00:57:57,819 --> 00:58:00,940
[SPEAKER_11]: We run, we jump, we swim and play

724
00:58:02,392 --> 00:58:06,556
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a great idea for something.

725
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:06,917
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

726
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just totally made me think of it for some reason.

727
00:58:31,262 --> 00:58:47,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't it be awesome if they had some sort of social network thing where you could basically create your own TV stations that people can watch actual programming, actual TV syndicated programming that you can basically design the lineup for and have that play and people would favor it and stuff.

728
00:58:47,128 --> 00:58:47,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be awesome?

729
00:58:48,348 --> 00:58:50,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't Hulu have like a playlist?

730
00:58:51,164 --> 00:58:52,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

731
00:59:08,366 --> 00:59:24,569
[SPEAKER_04]: and he got me an invite to the service and it kind of looks like iTunes kind of mixed with Napster but one of the big things is that you can build playlists and then like share them on Facebook and anybody can call up your playlist and play the songs because it's essentially kind of Napster.

732
00:59:24,989 --> 00:59:25,469
[SPEAKER_04]: in that way.

733
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:30,793
[SPEAKER_04]: New Napster, not old Napster, but the new one that's subscribed to the service and get everything.

734
00:59:31,053 --> 00:59:32,274
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's free for right now.

735
00:59:32,334 --> 00:59:38,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It's limited to 10 hours a month or something like that on free, but it's a good way to get exposed to some new songs.

736
00:59:38,618 --> 00:59:43,802
[SPEAKER_04]: But kind of what you're describing to me sounds like that with TV, because you'd be making a television playlist, right?

737
00:59:44,252 --> 00:59:45,313
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

738
01:00:01,942 --> 01:00:17,847
[SPEAKER_05]: 80s commercials for like products you know you could just have like the Lysol commercial whatever from the 80s but still advertising products that you have now or if people you know have products out there right now that they want to make an 80s type commercial for that'd be pretty awesome

739
01:00:18,706 --> 01:00:23,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently there's this, you know how they used to have the Nickelodeon Game and Sports channel?

740
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:24,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's around anymore, is it?

741
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:27,592
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to show the Legends of the Hidden Temple and Guts and all that stuff.

742
01:00:27,892 --> 01:00:30,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now there's a Teen Nick channel that might have replaced that.

743
01:00:31,114 --> 01:00:32,375
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's been around for a while.

744
01:00:32,415 --> 01:00:38,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, I guess Teen Nick has a whole now 90s segment coming back, and they're going to show all the shows from the 90s.

745
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:40,520
[SPEAKER_04]: on this.

746
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:44,042
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know I'm going to be camped out in front of Teen Nick.

747
01:00:44,142 --> 01:00:49,145
[SPEAKER_04]: My 33-year-old ass will be camped out in front of Teen Nick when they do the marathon for this.

748
01:00:50,885 --> 01:00:51,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

749
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:54,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally watched the crap out of that show.

750
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,512
[SPEAKER_10]: So what have any of these people done since it's set for her?

751
01:01:03,552 --> 01:01:06,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't she on a show on ABC Family with Joey Lawrence or something?

752
01:01:06,193 --> 01:01:07,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.

753
01:01:07,394 --> 01:01:08,694
[SPEAKER_05]: She's done a few things.

754
01:01:09,595 --> 01:01:09,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

755
01:01:13,464 --> 01:01:17,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Those poor parents probably don't get recognized for anything else than, Hey, it's Clarissa's parents!

756
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:19,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

757
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:24,777
[SPEAKER_04]: True story, did you know that they made a pilot for a CBS TV show that was like Clarissa Grows Up or something like that?

758
01:01:24,837 --> 01:01:25,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

759
01:01:25,317 --> 01:01:27,380
[SPEAKER_04]: That was something about her becoming a journalist.

760
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It really had nothing to do with the old show, but it just was her.

761
01:01:31,244 --> 01:01:31,925
[SPEAKER_10]: It would have been cool.

762
01:01:32,304 --> 01:01:34,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it didn't get picked up, so she went to do Sabrina instead.

763
01:01:35,006 --> 01:01:36,187
[SPEAKER_04]: That worked all right.

764
01:01:37,368 --> 01:01:37,708
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

765
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:47,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, there was another show that was on Nickelodeon when I was probably 19, but it was called, what was it called?

766
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:52,238
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like some soap opera that they tried to do, like the teenage soap opera.

767
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:53,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, 14.

768
01:01:54,259 --> 01:01:55,300
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't 14.

769
01:01:55,981 --> 01:01:56,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Or 15.

770
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:58,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 15 or 17 or something like that.

771
01:01:58,262 --> 01:01:58,923
[SPEAKER_04]: 15, I think, was the show.

772
01:01:59,003 --> 01:02:01,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember all the British programming that they used to have?

773
01:02:01,224 --> 01:02:01,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

774
01:02:02,446 --> 01:02:04,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember you can't do that on television.

775
01:02:04,206 --> 01:02:06,207
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the greatest show ever on that network.

776
01:02:06,227 --> 01:02:09,347
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing that they did was introduce me to one of my favorite shows of all time.

777
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, Moose.

778
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:11,608
[SPEAKER_10]: The Tomorrow People.

779
01:02:12,048 --> 01:02:12,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

780
01:02:12,928 --> 01:02:14,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Which actually was a BBC program.

781
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:16,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was talking about.

782
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,869
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a full serial, and the series had been around since the 70s.

783
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:23,650
[SPEAKER_10]: But I loved that damn show, and I watched the entire thing, and I've downloaded it.

784
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:25,611
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let me move on.

785
01:02:25,631 --> 01:02:27,371
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was out on DVD, I'd freaking buy it.

786
01:02:28,024 --> 01:02:28,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me move on.

787
01:02:28,965 --> 01:02:30,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Release dates for Japan.

788
01:02:30,585 --> 01:02:32,966
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we get from release dates to Clarissa Explains It All?

789
01:02:32,986 --> 01:02:33,386
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my fault.

790
01:02:33,506 --> 01:02:33,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

791
01:02:34,047 --> 01:02:35,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

792
01:02:35,327 --> 01:02:35,567
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

793
01:02:36,508 --> 01:02:39,169
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Xbox 360, some games coming out very soon.

794
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:45,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Alice Madness Returns in Japan as well as Fear F3AR.

795
01:02:45,872 --> 01:02:50,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIII International Edition comes to the Xbox 360 as well.

796
01:02:50,914 --> 01:02:51,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

797
01:02:51,194 --> 01:02:52,195
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a price reduction.

798
01:02:52,555 --> 01:02:52,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

799
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,269
[SPEAKER_04]: will only set you back about half as much as it did before.

800
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the PlayStation 3.

801
01:03:01,647 --> 01:03:05,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Alice Madness returns there as well, as well as F.E.A.R.

802
01:03:05,371 --> 01:03:08,174
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hearts.

803
01:03:08,314 --> 01:03:08,555
[SPEAKER_04]: F.E.A.R.

804
01:03:08,635 --> 01:03:09,355
[SPEAKER_04]: is Fear 3.

805
01:03:09,395 --> 01:03:09,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Fear 3.

806
01:03:10,637 --> 01:03:11,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's F.3.A.R.

807
01:03:12,058 --> 01:03:13,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that whole stylized... I know.

808
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:13,580
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

809
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Like how Scream 4 had a 4 in there.

810
01:03:15,422 --> 01:03:16,083
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, forget it.

811
01:03:16,984 --> 01:03:23,691
[SPEAKER_04]: No More Heroes, the Red Zone Edition, also on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan, and Sniper Ghost Warrior this week as well.

812
01:03:23,991 --> 01:03:25,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Sengoku Basara Chronicle Heroes Capcom

813
01:03:49,261 --> 01:03:53,845
[SPEAKER_04]: brings back the two-on-two battles and all the famous scenes from the previous six installments.

814
01:03:54,886 --> 01:03:57,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess this is a long-going... It's like Dynasty Warriors.

815
01:03:58,989 --> 01:04:00,611
[SPEAKER_04]: ...series in Japan.

816
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:05,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to bring out Nintendo, see what's going on in their world, if anything.

817
01:04:07,737 --> 01:04:08,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Devil Rhythm

818
01:04:30,604 --> 01:04:33,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've seen this girl in other games before, this little character.

819
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:33,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one?

820
01:04:34,026 --> 01:04:34,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen her before.

821
01:04:35,187 --> 01:04:38,089
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Gabrielle's Ghostly Groove is what's coming out over here.

822
01:04:38,109 --> 01:04:38,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

823
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:40,211
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a 3DS version of that.

824
01:04:41,732 --> 01:04:43,373
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on WiiWare right now if you want to check.

825
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:44,934
[SPEAKER_05]: WiiWare or DSiWare.

826
01:04:45,435 --> 01:04:45,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I think WiiWare.

827
01:04:47,656 --> 01:05:08,284
[SPEAKER_04]: and then next week Super Pokemon Scramble comes out on the 3DS so it's a Pokemon game even though it's not like an actual Pokemon game it's a Pokemon mini game thing I guess it looks kind of cute actually I'd check that out if it comes out over here there it is your Japanese release dates let's move over to the old kingdom DarkSakura

828
01:05:08,684 --> 01:05:09,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a whole bunch.

829
01:05:09,745 --> 01:05:16,771
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 22nd we have Calvarez, The Cartel, and Cars 2, The Video Game, and Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon.

830
01:05:17,852 --> 01:05:18,432
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

831
01:05:18,993 --> 01:05:20,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised it's coming out over there as Earth Defense Force.

832
01:05:20,995 --> 01:05:23,297
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to call it Global Defense Force.

833
01:05:24,162 --> 01:05:26,022
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to double check.

834
01:05:26,503 --> 01:05:27,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it says Earth Defense Force.

835
01:05:28,503 --> 01:05:30,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they not like the word Earth over there or something?

836
01:05:31,084 --> 01:05:41,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was the fact that they were localizing it from Japan, so they called it Global Defense Force over there.

837
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:42,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It never really came out over here on PlayStation.

838
01:05:42,966 --> 01:05:44,867
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's our fault for calling it Earth Defense Force.

839
01:05:44,887 --> 01:05:49,988
[SPEAKER_10]: There were a lot of other series that were renamed just for censorship issues, like Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.

840
01:05:50,188 --> 01:05:56,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm also thinking about, you know, what comes to mind is the whole fact that Captain America's coming out in some countries as the first Avenger.

841
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:59,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, it's Captain America's a bad thing.

842
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:00,331
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just funny.

843
01:06:02,312 --> 01:06:02,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

844
01:06:02,632 --> 01:06:04,053
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm totally serious.

845
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Certain countries are getting it as the first Avenger.

846
01:06:07,514 --> 01:06:08,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So, interesting.

847
01:06:09,034 --> 01:06:10,755
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.

848
01:06:11,055 --> 01:06:16,817
[SPEAKER_10]: At least they're not giving it the Hetalia treatment where he's making, you know, he's eating cheeseburgers or something.

849
01:06:17,677 --> 01:06:20,943
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple more news stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.

850
01:06:21,063 --> 01:06:21,865
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, Loki.

851
01:06:22,401 --> 01:06:25,362
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'd be willing to see, like, you know how they have Italian Spider-Man?

852
01:06:25,462 --> 01:06:26,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Italian Captain America.

853
01:06:27,762 --> 01:06:29,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Japanese Spider-Man is freaking hilarious, by the way.

854
01:06:31,023 --> 01:06:32,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

855
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:36,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a new model of PlayStation 3 coming out.

856
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:38,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually now, I believe.

857
01:06:40,005 --> 01:06:45,646
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's to conform to a new thing that was passed back in December.

858
01:06:46,146 --> 01:06:48,227
[SPEAKER_05]: The, what was it, the...

859
01:06:49,252 --> 01:07:10,580
[SPEAKER_05]: and the AACS Final Adopter Agreement which basically is some sort of DRM that they have standardized that all media companies must adhere to and this means that they need to only support Blu-ray playback high definition Blu-ray playback

860
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:16,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Only over HDMI because it's the only way this kind of DRM works.

861
01:07:16,584 --> 01:07:26,312
[SPEAKER_05]: So these new systems will be unable to play HD Blu-ray movies over Component.

862
01:07:26,652 --> 01:07:28,834
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only going to be available through HDMI.

863
01:07:30,955 --> 01:07:31,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Games are fine.

864
01:07:31,876 --> 01:07:40,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Games you can still play over Component but you will not be able to play over Component for Blu-ray.

865
01:07:40,943 --> 01:07:42,704
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something Sony is necessarily doing.

866
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:44,144
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that everybody has to do.

867
01:07:46,045 --> 01:07:56,928
[SPEAKER_05]: If Microsoft has a new system coming out, say that supports Blu-ray later on, they will not be able to have Blu-ray playback over Component.

868
01:07:58,382 --> 01:07:59,643
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about, Loki?

869
01:07:59,683 --> 01:08:02,045
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just because Sony's a bunch of cheap bastards.

870
01:08:02,085 --> 01:08:09,070
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why this is happening, because they are cheap bastards and they want to cut out the things that they're putting in the boxes for the PlayStation 3.

871
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:12,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you mean cut out things that they're putting in the boxes.

872
01:08:12,853 --> 01:08:14,715
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I read on the internet, so it must be true.

873
01:08:15,515 --> 01:08:17,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what initially everyone thought.

874
01:08:19,817 --> 01:08:20,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Like myself.

875
01:08:21,637 --> 01:08:23,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, I wouldn't put it past them.

876
01:08:24,398 --> 01:08:29,280
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done things to cut out power usage and stuff like that.

877
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,941
[SPEAKER_05]: It really just saves them money on components.

878
01:08:31,061 --> 01:08:37,143
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead you're telling me that Sony just waited until the last minute to implement their own standard for Blu-ray.

879
01:08:39,019 --> 01:08:43,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, not even really the last minute because I don't think this goes into effect until 2012.

880
01:08:43,806 --> 01:08:46,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So they kind of just said, hey, you know what?

881
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:47,271
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to do it now.

882
01:08:49,294 --> 01:08:51,057
[SPEAKER_04]: And before the Xmas rush.

883
01:08:51,471 --> 01:08:52,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

884
01:08:54,052 --> 01:08:56,553
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing, though, is they didn't ever explain it to anybody.

885
01:08:56,894 --> 01:09:05,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think there's anything on the box that calls out... Well, I don't see Sony putting out a press release going, guess what, we've taken a feature away from the PlayStation 3.

886
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:07,339
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they don't have to say it like that.

887
01:09:07,379 --> 01:09:16,003
[SPEAKER_05]: They could just say, due to blah, blah, blah, playback of high-def Blu-ray movies can only be facilitated through HDMI.

888
01:09:16,023 --> 01:09:16,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

889
01:09:17,144 --> 01:09:21,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be clear, though, you can still hook up your PlayStation 3 through component cables.

890
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:26,442
[SPEAKER_04]: It will only play the games and the movies in standard def, right?

891
01:09:26,803 --> 01:09:27,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

892
01:09:28,867 --> 01:09:28,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

893
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:30,910
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

894
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:32,891
[SPEAKER_04]: My old TV didn't even have HDMI.

895
01:09:32,971 --> 01:09:34,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to hook up through Component, and it was an HDTV.

896
01:09:34,932 --> 01:09:41,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully, I do have HDMI on my TV, and I am hooked up through HDMI for my PlayStation 3.

897
01:09:41,614 --> 01:09:48,677
[SPEAKER_05]: But once again, I mean, because HDMI cables are so damn cheap, I don't understand why they don't throw one in there.

898
01:09:48,997 --> 01:09:49,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, I know why.

899
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:54,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they sell HDMI cables for $40 when anybody can go out and get them for like $3.

900
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:54,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

901
01:09:58,908 --> 01:09:59,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

902
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:00,717
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks, but that's life.

903
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, one more story for you guys.

904
01:10:04,113 --> 01:10:06,255
[SPEAKER_04]: This has to do with a new Bomani game.

905
01:10:06,715 --> 01:10:14,701
[SPEAKER_04]: For you fans of DDR and Beatmania 2DX, there's information about a new game that is being tested at Leisureland in Akiba, Tokyo.

906
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:18,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It is called Sound Voltex Booth.

907
01:10:18,603 --> 01:10:20,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not vortex, that's voltex.

908
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like volts, like energy.

909
01:10:23,307 --> 01:10:30,672
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some video that has hit the internet that shows this game in action, and apparently kind of what this game looks like... That's the little fuzzy music you hear in the background...

910
01:10:31,212 --> 01:10:38,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of looks like, imagine like a Beatmania screen that's more like Guitar Hero, I guess, looking like that.

911
01:10:38,599 --> 01:10:42,623
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks like not only are there buttons, but there's some type of tilt mechanism in this game too.

912
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:50,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you'll notice as the song goes on, the guy kind of has to drive and tilt the thing a little bit before he starts hitting buttons.

913
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:52,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like it kind of incorporates both those features into it.

914
01:10:53,593 --> 01:10:54,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of interesting.

915
01:10:56,288 --> 01:10:56,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Location Test

916
01:11:18,756 --> 01:11:37,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami has trademarked some names Sound Voltex Booth and Sound Voltex Floor possibly localized versions of the game I don't know, I guess it would depend on how well this one does so, we'll see anyhow, it's time to take a stroll down memory lane in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week

917
01:11:40,094 --> 01:11:46,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week here at Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura dives into the vault and pulls out a classic game that she thinks, hey, why aren't you kids playing this game?

918
01:11:46,784 --> 01:11:47,525
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

919
01:11:48,507 --> 01:11:49,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough with your newfangled crap.

920
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:52,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy this old classic for a change.

921
01:11:52,553 --> 01:11:54,897
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

922
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:56,457
[SPEAKER_10]: It is Tekken 3.

923
01:11:57,639 --> 01:12:01,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I figured since I did Soul Blade last week, I'd do Tekken 3 this week.

924
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:05,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this was my favorite fighting game for ages.

925
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,533
[SPEAKER_10]: It came out in the arcade in March 1997.

926
01:12:12,455 --> 01:12:13,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And it came out on the PlayStation in 1998.

927
01:12:16,338 --> 01:12:23,482
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a simplified arcade version that came out on PS2 as part of Tekken 5's arcade history mode.

928
01:12:25,022 --> 01:12:28,484
[SPEAKER_10]: But the PlayStation version is probably considered one of the greatest ones ever.

929
01:12:29,484 --> 01:12:39,009
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the first game on Namco System 12 hardware, and it was the last one that came on the original PlayStation.

930
01:12:40,632 --> 01:12:42,334
[SPEAKER_10]: It is such a fun game.

931
01:12:42,574 --> 01:12:48,140
[SPEAKER_10]: This game came out when I worked for Namco Arcade and I played the crap out of it.

932
01:12:49,822 --> 01:13:01,974
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as the characters that were in it, it had basically, you could unlock all of the classic characters later on, but it had its own new characters too.

933
01:13:03,275 --> 01:13:11,083
[SPEAKER_10]: The ones that returned at the beginning were Paul Phoenix, Nina Williams, Yoshimitsu, and Lei Wulong.

934
01:13:11,663 --> 01:13:14,486
[SPEAKER_10]: And also you could unlock Anna Williams and Heihachi.

935
01:13:15,367 --> 01:13:27,358
[SPEAKER_10]: And the new characters that came in were Jin Kazama, Xiaoyu, Hualrong, King2, which is the wrestler with the mask, Eddie Gordo, who is every masher's favorite.

936
01:13:28,018 --> 01:13:28,959
[SPEAKER_10]: and ForestFlaw.

937
01:13:28,999 --> 01:13:46,331
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you could also unlock Kuma and Panda, Julia Chung, who was my second favorite person to use in the game, Brian Fury, Gunjack, Mokujin, Ogre, True Ogre, and Tiger Jackson, who was the swap for Eddie Gordo with the Fro and everything.

938
01:13:46,872 --> 01:13:48,313
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the character I loved right here.

939
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:48,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Hwarong.

940
01:13:48,773 --> 01:13:49,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Hwarong.

941
01:13:49,694 --> 01:13:50,014
[SPEAKER_04]: He's awesome.

942
01:13:50,034 --> 01:13:50,694
[SPEAKER_10]: I love his music.

943
01:13:50,714 --> 01:13:52,035
[SPEAKER_10]: You can turn it up a little bit.

944
01:13:52,075 --> 01:13:52,336
Hwarong.

945
01:13:55,365 --> 01:13:55,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

946
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:19,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, in the PlayStation version, you had two other characters.

947
01:14:19,213 --> 01:14:26,997
[SPEAKER_10]: You had Gon, who I don't know if anyone's ever heard of the comic, and I will link something in the chat room.

948
01:14:27,597 --> 01:14:36,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Gon is a little dinosaur, and there is a manga, a big manga series, and honestly, his ending and everything was pretty...

949
01:14:37,302 --> 01:14:38,043
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

950
01:14:53,787 --> 01:15:05,394
[SPEAKER_10]: and also Dr. Bosconovich, who was actually supposed to be an unlockable in the arcade version, but he ended up being a bonus in the PlayStation version.

951
01:15:06,334 --> 01:15:15,319
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was another one that was for Bleemcast, which was a boot disk for the Dreamcast that you could boot the PlayStation version of the game.

952
01:15:15,399 --> 01:15:18,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got it, and it really just enhanced the resolution.

953
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:20,102
[SPEAKER_10]: It made it look a lot better.

954
01:15:21,002 --> 01:15:21,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

955
01:15:23,064 --> 01:15:28,950
[SPEAKER_10]: But it also did sort of screw up some of the background images versus the stage.

956
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:36,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of almost how it did in... You remember the Japanese version of Tekken Tag Tournament?

957
01:15:36,678 --> 01:15:39,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Where it would do that weird thing between the ground and the backwards stage?

958
01:15:39,542 --> 01:15:40,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Where they would separate?

959
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:41,684
[SPEAKER_10]: It kind of did that number.

960
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:51,275
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, this is lauded by lots of people as one of the best PlayStation games ever.

961
01:15:51,476 --> 01:15:59,165
[SPEAKER_10]: It got a 96 out of 100 on Metacritic, and it's ranked the number two on their list of greatest PlayStation games.

962
01:15:59,285 --> 01:16:00,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, this was the music I really liked.

963
01:16:05,834 --> 01:16:06,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Forrest Law's music.

964
01:16:08,596 --> 01:16:09,336
[SPEAKER_10]: His ending was funny.

965
01:16:10,677 --> 01:16:13,518
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, I have beaten him, but never the one.

966
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:17,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, this is actually a little bit of fun trivia.

967
01:16:17,581 --> 01:16:29,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Tekken 3 was the first game to get a 10 on EGM's revised review scale, saying that a game no longer had to be perfect to get a 10, and the last game that got a 10 was Sonic & Knuckles.

968
01:16:31,029 --> 01:16:33,030
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it honestly is...

969
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:36,721
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my favorites.

970
01:16:36,761 --> 01:16:41,567
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I have to say it is a masher's paradise, especially with Eddie Gordo.

971
01:16:43,089 --> 01:16:44,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I loved him.

972
01:16:44,691 --> 01:16:45,432
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

973
01:16:45,845 --> 01:16:49,367
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I would only use him to play Tiger, because Tiger was so freaking hilarious.

974
01:16:50,267 --> 01:17:01,293
[SPEAKER_10]: But the game had great music, and I'll tell you one thing, actually, and this is actually fairly common with me and the Namco games when they bring them home and have their arranged version of the soundtrack.

975
01:17:02,233 --> 01:17:06,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I always preferred the arcade soundtrack, except for a couple of cases in Soul Calibur.

976
01:17:06,996 --> 01:17:10,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Not Soul Calibur, but Soul Blade, because I like Cervantes' arranged music better.

977
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:13,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

978
01:17:32,993 --> 01:17:37,137
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would always watch the Japanese forums to see who was going to be the next character to come out.

979
01:17:37,577 --> 01:17:43,823
[SPEAKER_10]: And they actually had a different release schedule for the US machines versus the Japanese machines.

980
01:17:44,483 --> 01:17:50,388
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would sometimes be able to guess, because they had this little screen pop up that says, guess who or who's next or something.

981
01:17:51,089 --> 01:17:54,092
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would usually be able to accurately say who was the next character coming out.

982
01:17:55,153 --> 01:17:56,233
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was pretty neat.

983
01:17:57,174 --> 01:17:57,655
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh...

984
01:17:59,235 --> 01:17:59,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoops.

985
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:36,717
[SPEAKER_10]: and we were talking about just seeing how far it could go and I said, there's going to come a day where you're not going to be able to tell the 3D from the real thing.

986
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:44,284
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they've even got different types of motion capture so advanced that you really can't tell the difference unless you're really looking for it, you know?

987
01:18:45,766 --> 01:18:45,966
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

988
01:18:47,407 --> 01:18:53,534
[SPEAKER_10]: But as far as this, it is, I think to this day, my favorite Tekken game.

989
01:18:53,714 --> 01:18:56,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I really loved Tekken 4.

990
01:18:56,918 --> 01:19:05,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still pissed off about... What was that game, that company, that I gave the bad Better Business Bureau review to?

991
01:19:07,049 --> 01:19:11,631
[SPEAKER_10]: because they sent me the Asian version and not the Japanese version and I specifically asked for the Japanese version.

992
01:19:11,851 --> 01:19:12,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even remember.

993
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:14,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of those, like, was it Toys?

994
01:19:14,853 --> 01:19:16,053
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't Toys and Joys.

995
01:19:16,093 --> 01:19:17,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Toys and Joys has always been good.

996
01:19:18,294 --> 01:19:23,597
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like, import something or... Yeah, I know what you're talking about, though.

997
01:19:23,637 --> 01:19:25,077
[SPEAKER_10]: They're long since out of business, but...

998
01:19:26,818 --> 01:19:48,449
[SPEAKER_10]: The other good thing about this one is that, like I mentioned, it had a mode called Tekken Force, which was a kind of side-scrolling version, a beat-em-up like Streets of Rage, and it was one where you would go through different stages, and if you beat the minigame four times, then you could unlock Dr. Bosconovich.

999
01:19:50,009 --> 01:19:51,110
[SPEAKER_10]: You had to beat him first, of course.

1000
01:19:51,670 --> 01:20:13,001
[SPEAKER_10]: and then it had another version that was called Tekken Ball that was like beach volleyball except you had to charge the ball so you had to use a powerful attack to try to hurt your opponent or hit the ball so that it hits the ground and then your character would get injured if it touched the ground or the opponent's character would get injured if it touched the ground and

1001
01:20:16,462 --> 01:20:17,243
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just awesome.

1002
01:20:17,303 --> 01:20:18,123
[SPEAKER_10]: It was super fun.

1003
01:20:18,263 --> 01:20:23,847
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can still find it, you know, and if you get Tekken 5, it's in the history mode.

1004
01:20:23,947 --> 01:20:25,428
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

1005
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:28,890
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the best games ever, I think.

1006
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is, Tekken 3.

1007
01:20:31,671 --> 01:20:34,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I like this character.

1008
01:20:35,192 --> 01:20:35,852
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one ran out.

1009
01:20:35,892 --> 01:20:37,953
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's funny in the intro, though, on the PlayStation version?

1010
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,034
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what Namco was doing.

1011
01:20:40,074 --> 01:20:42,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Look how we can render individual hairs!

1012
01:20:43,216 --> 01:20:45,197
[SPEAKER_10]: And it looks so unnatural.

1013
01:20:46,197 --> 01:20:46,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1014
01:20:46,537 --> 01:20:47,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, jeez.

1015
01:20:47,898 --> 01:20:48,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1016
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:51,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well that's going to do it for the Classic Game of the Week.

1017
01:20:51,961 --> 01:20:55,985
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't go anywhere because Orange Lingerie is going to be right back with Part B of our show tonight.

1018
01:20:56,305 --> 01:20:57,887
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some rapid fire news for you guys.

1019
01:20:57,927 --> 01:20:59,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Some news about PopCap got sold.

1020
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:00,770
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to talk about that one.

1021
01:21:01,531 --> 01:21:05,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about some news around EA's camp when it comes to server shutdowns.

1022
01:21:05,675 --> 01:21:06,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And some...

1023
01:21:07,256 --> 01:21:08,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Discussion topics tonight.

1024
01:21:08,317 --> 01:21:15,743
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, tonight the news is a little bit light, but we're going to talk about is good parenting better than a violent video game ban?

1025
01:21:15,943 --> 01:21:17,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that'll get everybody riled up here in studio.

1026
01:21:18,265 --> 01:21:21,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And stop hating on sports games, says one writer.

1027
01:21:21,628 --> 01:21:25,672
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about all that when we come back with more tonight of Orange Lounge Radio.

1028
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:32,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio

1029
01:21:47,134 --> 01:21:52,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we're going to get back into some gaming news, including rapid-fire news, as well as your tweets.

1030
01:21:52,518 --> 01:21:56,881
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is your last chance to get in those Twitter topics, twitter.com slash OLR.

1031
01:21:56,941 --> 01:22:01,044
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, I want to just give a quick plug for other projects and things that we're working on.

1032
01:22:01,404 --> 01:22:06,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth is a Warcraft podcast that I host with my buddy, Extifer.

1033
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:27,618
[SPEAKER_04]: for more information you can visit www.hoardhouse.com sadly there wasn't a new show this week so there was some other stuff going on but we should be back next week so this would be a great time to catch up on the 31 some odd back episodes there are of the show and listen to our potty humor in talking about Warcraft but never too seriously I have a new impression by the way what's that?

1034
01:22:28,178 --> 01:22:29,199
[SPEAKER_10]: What is nature's call?

1035
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:32,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I get sick of hearing it every time.

1036
01:22:32,522 --> 01:22:35,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that one of the chicks in Warcraft when you get a quest?

1037
01:22:35,544 --> 01:22:35,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Avrila?

1038
01:22:36,225 --> 01:22:37,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1039
01:22:37,246 --> 01:22:38,627
[SPEAKER_10]: The centaur girl?

1040
01:22:38,647 --> 01:22:39,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1041
01:22:40,408 --> 01:22:41,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, the great outdoors!

1042
01:22:41,909 --> 01:22:43,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I know exactly who you're talking about.

1043
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:45,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw her.

1044
01:22:45,552 --> 01:22:45,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1045
01:22:46,033 --> 01:22:46,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow!

1046
01:22:47,774 --> 01:22:48,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Very carefully.

1047
01:22:48,595 --> 01:22:49,856
[SPEAKER_04]: You just gotta get those hind... never mind.

1048
01:22:50,456 --> 01:22:50,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1049
01:22:51,438 --> 01:22:54,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I want to plug a guest appearance I did this week on Under Sedation Live.

1050
01:22:54,963 --> 01:22:56,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, it was their 10th anniversary show.

1051
01:22:56,425 --> 01:22:58,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about that at the top of the program, but fun.

1052
01:22:59,029 --> 01:23:01,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the chatters were saying it was a very different side of me.

1053
01:23:01,613 --> 01:23:03,295
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on that show, and I'm just saying, well, I just...

1054
01:23:04,144 --> 01:23:05,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really about games.

1055
01:23:05,685 --> 01:23:07,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the old Rob.

1056
01:23:07,706 --> 01:23:08,446
[SPEAKER_04]: It was still me.

1057
01:23:08,826 --> 01:23:10,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't go in there with a different mindset.

1058
01:23:10,447 --> 01:23:14,269
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just I don't have to worry about... It's not my show, quote unquote, anymore.

1059
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:15,750
[SPEAKER_10]: You're different when you're not facilitating.

1060
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:16,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not facilitating.

1061
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:17,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not in the MC role.

1062
01:23:17,671 --> 01:23:21,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And plus, I realize on that show, conversation will go anywhere and anywhere.

1063
01:23:21,573 --> 01:23:25,835
[SPEAKER_04]: This show, I've got to make sure after a 20-minute tangent, it does get back to games eventually.

1064
01:23:26,175 --> 01:23:26,715
[SPEAKER_04]: But that show...

1065
01:23:28,717 --> 01:23:33,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I was in the same boat when I was running the gig when Tiara guested.

1066
01:23:33,503 --> 01:23:36,868
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a different role.

1067
01:23:37,489 --> 01:23:38,450
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have to be moderator.

1068
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:44,458
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like Julie Chan on Big Brother versus Julie Chan on The Talk for those that actually watch daytime TV.

1069
01:23:44,798 --> 01:23:46,379
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1070
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:37,437
[SPEAKER_10]: because they discovered robots have emotion now yes apparently she got her emotion chip put in she can learn DarkSakura I don't know if you can plug the stuff you've been guesting on it's actually the podcast that Tiara and our friend Weasel do for Geek Life it's called Pop Culture Parlay if you go to geek-life.com I am going to be on the next two episodes so yay awesome

1071
01:24:38,512 --> 01:24:43,705
[SPEAKER_10]: and it was a very interesting discussion and there was some Pyramid Head mentioned.

1072
01:24:44,787 --> 01:24:45,389
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll leave it at that.

1073
01:24:46,112 --> 01:24:46,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1074
01:24:47,253 --> 01:24:51,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So by the way, it sounds like I didn't even realize this, but the chat room is telling me my audio cut out for a little bit there.

1075
01:24:51,516 --> 01:24:54,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's the mic or whatever, but there was audio issues.

1076
01:24:54,558 --> 01:24:57,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me now, chat room?

1077
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:58,241
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not you.

1078
01:24:58,301 --> 01:24:58,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was me.

1079
01:24:59,302 --> 01:24:59,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

1080
01:24:59,923 --> 01:25:00,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what's going on.

1081
01:25:01,544 --> 01:25:06,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob was talking about how he likes to do things in the dark.

1082
01:25:06,347 --> 01:25:09,270
[SPEAKER_04]: How sad I'm giving the plug for Under Sedation Live and it cut out.

1083
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:12,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob was on Under Sedation Live, guys, and it was epic.

1084
01:25:12,972 --> 01:25:13,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there you go.

1085
01:25:13,813 --> 01:25:14,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1086
01:25:15,134 --> 01:25:17,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to Horde House, listen on your station live.

1087
01:25:17,177 --> 01:25:18,499
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was diarrhea involved.

1088
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:19,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not.

1089
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:23,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Should I go check on your coffee?

1090
01:25:26,289 --> 01:25:28,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's a good thing to bring up right after that.

1091
01:25:29,301 --> 01:25:32,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, can we move on, please, with some rapid-fire news.

1092
01:25:32,823 --> 01:25:41,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to... And, by the way, Brad from PodCulture in the chatroom says, Big difference between innocent and not guilty.

1093
01:25:41,948 --> 01:25:47,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get too political on this program or what have you or talk about controversial stuff because, you know...

1094
01:25:47,931 --> 01:26:03,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let, uh, what's her name, uh, God, what's, what's that chick on the CNN show that, oh God, Nancy Grace, that's, that, I'll leave that discussion to her, but fine, I stand corrected on, on my earlier comment Uh, let's get to some rapid fire news though, Loki, why don't you start us

1095
01:26:03,968 --> 01:26:14,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well there is a rumor that apparently during Comic Con they're going to announce a new Marvel vs. Capcom kind of iteration, I guess.

1096
01:26:15,812 --> 01:26:17,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Marvel vs. Capcom 3 to be exact.

1097
01:26:18,492 --> 01:26:29,956
[SPEAKER_05]: The actual announcement is supposed to be Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and it's supposed to include a roster update including, I think, 12 extra characters.

1098
01:26:30,956 --> 01:26:38,501
[SPEAKER_05]: are supposed to be added to the roster and it will be sold for $40 retail.

1099
01:26:38,841 --> 01:26:51,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the rumored characters, of course, Doc Doc, because I guess there were some files that referenced him in the ISO that was floating around out there.

1100
01:26:52,729 --> 01:26:59,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, there is a panel for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at Comic Con, so it makes sense that they would maybe make an announcement.

1101
01:27:00,242 --> 01:27:02,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they just want to give out tips.

1102
01:27:04,604 --> 01:27:05,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, maybe not.

1103
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:09,145
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to believe that it wasn't that long ago that the game came out.

1104
01:27:09,165 --> 01:27:10,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, February.

1105
01:27:11,086 --> 01:27:15,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Street Fighter 4 and Super Street Fighter 4, kind of the same thing happened.

1106
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1107
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:18,109
[SPEAKER_05]: 12 characters is a lot, though.

1108
01:27:18,429 --> 01:27:19,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that would be kind of cool.

1109
01:27:21,911 --> 01:27:22,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other fun stuff.

1110
01:27:23,853 --> 01:27:27,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, the Super Mario Bros.

1111
01:27:27,516 --> 01:27:28,817
[SPEAKER_05]: movie could have been a lot better.

1112
01:27:29,217 --> 01:27:36,223
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the earlier drafts, I guess, of the script actually had it a little bit more traditional to the actual Mario Bros.

1113
01:27:36,263 --> 01:27:36,484
[SPEAKER_05]: game.

1114
01:27:37,304 --> 01:27:45,531
[SPEAKER_05]: There actually was supposed to be some sort of epic boss fight over lava and stuff with Koopa and a lot of, like, you know...

1115
01:27:47,879 --> 01:27:52,120
[SPEAKER_05]: The scenery that you would see in the game will actually kind of take place in the movie.

1116
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I guess Koopa's flying around in a giant floating pirate ship.

1117
01:27:56,801 --> 01:28:05,903
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately what we got ended up being some sort of weird Mario Judge Dredd movie.

1118
01:28:06,383 --> 01:28:07,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute.

1119
01:28:07,264 --> 01:28:12,905
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean that executives came in and fucked the whole thing up because they thought they knew what people wanted?

1120
01:28:13,945 --> 01:28:15,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard of this happening before.

1121
01:28:15,866 --> 01:28:16,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Not anywhere.

1122
01:28:18,194 --> 01:28:19,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, I know.

1123
01:28:19,415 --> 01:28:19,876
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird.

1124
01:28:20,036 --> 01:28:20,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird.

1125
01:28:22,598 --> 01:28:23,239
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what they did.

1126
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:27,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, I guess this is kind of funny.

1127
01:28:27,723 --> 01:28:33,129
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually had a dig at Capcom in Ms.

1128
01:28:33,209 --> 01:28:34,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Splosion Man.

1129
01:28:34,891 --> 01:28:42,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's during one of the levels that looks very much like the Star Road in Super Mario World.

1130
01:28:42,778 --> 01:28:44,179
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're all, who does this?

1131
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:47,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is completely ripped off.

1132
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:49,421
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this, a Capcom game or something?

1133
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:51,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's funny.

1134
01:28:52,682 --> 01:28:52,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1135
01:28:53,782 --> 01:28:55,783
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, going to some other quick stories here.

1136
01:28:56,403 --> 01:28:59,084
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an epic mod on its way out for StarCraft.

1137
01:28:59,144 --> 01:29:01,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called StarCraft Universe.

1138
01:29:01,185 --> 01:29:04,106
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have known this previously as World of StarCraft.

1139
01:29:04,346 --> 01:29:05,267
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1140
01:29:19,443 --> 01:29:22,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this was all back in January when that whole thing happened.

1141
01:29:23,206 --> 01:29:26,789
[SPEAKER_04]: But now there is a trailer out with gameplay from the alpha version.

1142
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:34,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess in a press release that the dude sent to Kotaku, he wanted to update everybody on the mod's progress.

1143
01:29:34,776 --> 01:29:37,018
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, kind of interesting that it's going.

1144
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:40,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me play a little bit of that trailer here in studio so folks can see what that is.

1145
01:29:41,301 --> 01:29:45,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this looks like an epic mod for StarCraft.

1146
01:29:45,022 --> 01:29:45,943
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some cinematics there.

1147
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:47,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see if we can get some gameplay.

1148
01:29:47,803 --> 01:29:54,165
[SPEAKER_04]: When you look at the gameplay, it really does kind of look like World of Warcraft, but in the StarCraft universe, which is kind of cool.

1149
01:29:55,946 --> 01:30:02,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Complete with the hit points for numbers and the whole kind of first-person-esque 3D environments.

1150
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:05,306
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1151
01:30:23,882 --> 01:30:28,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the creator of this actually left school to work on StarCraft Universe for full time.

1152
01:30:29,185 --> 01:30:34,708
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, at this point, I'm learning way more creating StarCraft Universe than I ever would at school.

1153
01:30:35,149 --> 01:30:43,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of my friends trying to get into creative industry find themselves having to grind out a massive portfolio to find any work after four years of college.

1154
01:30:44,334 --> 01:30:45,175
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very true.

1155
01:30:46,055 --> 01:30:47,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's crazy.

1156
01:30:47,816 --> 01:30:47,976
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1157
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard would be dumb not to hire him if this ends up being a pretty awesome thing here.

1158
01:30:56,158 --> 01:30:56,758
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to see.

1159
01:30:57,938 --> 01:30:59,579
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to see how that works out.

1160
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, other news stories.

1161
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:06,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Incubus, you know the band, they're getting their own video game.

1162
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Incubattle.

1163
01:31:09,841 --> 01:31:14,642
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beat-em-up that's very similar to Scott Pilgrim vs. the World in that whole retro style.

1164
01:31:14,662 --> 01:31:17,682
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what that reminds me of actually more so than that?

1165
01:31:17,982 --> 01:31:21,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the Linkin Park game that they put out in like iOS or something?

1166
01:31:21,323 --> 01:31:21,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1167
01:31:21,884 --> 01:31:23,065
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very much like that.

1168
01:31:23,125 --> 01:31:23,565
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1169
01:31:23,605 --> 01:31:27,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can pick one of the band's five members and you go on the streets and fight.

1170
01:31:28,429 --> 01:31:29,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Who do you fight?

1171
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:32,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Pirates trying to steal the band's latest album.

1172
01:31:34,054 --> 01:31:34,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously?

1173
01:31:34,855 --> 01:31:36,296
[SPEAKER_04]: That is seriously who you're fighting.

1174
01:31:38,257 --> 01:31:38,838
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1175
01:31:39,499 --> 01:31:42,422
[SPEAKER_04]: No indication on what, I mean, you can click on this.

1176
01:31:42,462 --> 01:31:43,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a Flash game or something?

1177
01:31:44,604 --> 01:31:45,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1178
01:31:45,745 --> 01:31:47,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it looks like a little Flash game you can actually play there.

1179
01:31:48,408 --> 01:31:49,369
[SPEAKER_04]: That's retarded.

1180
01:31:49,409 --> 01:31:50,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not going to play that.

1181
01:31:50,811 --> 01:31:55,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go cause physical harm to pirates because they do physical harm to my wall.

1182
01:31:55,716 --> 01:31:58,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if they have the whole hats and the eye patch, that's actually kind of awesome.

1183
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:06,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Arkham City's collector's edition has announced some pre-orders.

1184
01:32:06,954 --> 01:32:10,037
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop and Best Buy both priced the collector's edition.

1185
01:32:10,537 --> 01:32:27,231
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see, Best Buy actually went ahead and priced the collection at $99.99 and explained the content saying, a premium statue, an art book, Gotham Knight animated material, and, interestingly enough, early access to download content.

1186
01:32:27,731 --> 01:32:30,914
[SPEAKER_04]: It all comes out on October 18th when the game is set to come out.

1187
01:32:31,414 --> 01:32:32,275
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1188
01:32:49,824 --> 01:32:50,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there you go.

1189
01:32:51,525 --> 01:32:57,709
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, we actually have a new Incubus single apparently has released to promote the new game.

1190
01:32:57,829 --> 01:32:59,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have known that this is coming out?

1191
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:00,291
[SPEAKER_04]: But here you go.

1192
01:33:00,631 --> 01:33:02,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a little listen here.

1193
01:33:11,176 --> 01:33:16,060
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, I'll just make a copy for me and a friend Then he'll make one and she'll make one and where will it end?

1194
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:30,491
[SPEAKER_00]: One leads to another, then more And no one buys any dish from the store So no one gets paid and they can't make more The posse breaks up and that's close to store Don't copy, don't copy that floppy So let me break this down for you

1195
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:34,361
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1196
01:33:34,401 --> 01:33:35,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't copy that floppy.

1197
01:33:35,622 --> 01:33:38,404
[SPEAKER_04]: The hot new Incubus single that's going to be in that game.

1198
01:33:38,624 --> 01:33:39,205
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

1199
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:40,246
[SPEAKER_04]: As you fight the pirates.

1200
01:33:40,646 --> 01:33:41,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell about some different news.

1201
01:33:41,507 --> 01:33:42,608
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an interesting new sound for them.

1202
01:33:43,308 --> 01:33:44,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1203
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:47,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's some good news.

1204
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:50,474
[SPEAKER_10]: For Sonic Generations, guess who's going to be there?

1205
01:33:51,295 --> 01:33:52,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Metal Sonic!

1206
01:33:52,435 --> 01:33:56,477
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's going to be old school Metal Sonic and he's going to be one of the rivals.

1207
01:33:57,697 --> 01:33:59,758
[SPEAKER_10]: I freaking love Mecha Sonic so that's really cool.

1208
01:34:00,658 --> 01:34:04,820
[SPEAKER_10]: That was actually my favorite part of Sonic CD.

1209
01:34:06,556 --> 01:34:07,677
[SPEAKER_10]: and then Konami.

1210
01:34:07,977 --> 01:34:09,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Konami again.

1211
01:34:09,618 --> 01:34:11,099
[SPEAKER_10]: They're giving us a choice.

1212
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:24,088
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually up on Xbox Live Arcade and PSN where they're going to let basically the people who subscribe to these services choose the next game.

1213
01:34:24,148 --> 01:34:25,469
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on their Facebook page.

1214
01:34:26,109 --> 01:34:27,010
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a question there.

1215
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:32,053
[SPEAKER_10]: In a perfect world, what previously released Konami classic would you like to see next on Xbox Live Arcade or PSN?

1216
01:34:32,373 --> 01:34:33,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Simpsons Arcade game.

1217
01:34:33,694 --> 01:34:33,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1218
01:34:34,975 --> 01:34:36,395
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I want YY Konami World.

1219
01:34:37,256 --> 01:34:43,518
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, last but not least, Child of Eden is going to be on PlayStation 3 on September 23rd.

1220
01:34:44,618 --> 01:34:58,162
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's basically going to also have revised versions, I believe, of some other games, I want to say.

1221
01:35:00,271 --> 01:35:18,507
[SPEAKER_10]: there's Call of Juarez the Cartel on the 16th of September World Rally Championship 2011 on October 7th and Connect Party Rabbids Alive and Kicking on 360 in November also Far Cry 3 and Brothers in Arms Furious 4 are going to be on 2012 the end

1222
01:35:21,255 --> 01:35:23,877
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get to Twitter topics tonight.

01:35:24,337 --> 01:35:30,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR, because after all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

1225
01:35:37,766 --> 01:35:41,869
[SPEAKER_04]: We read your feedback in 120, or excuse me, 140 characters or less.

1226
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:48,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Ramaditya Knight tweets us, saying, what is your favorite NES multi-cart?

1227
01:35:49,588 --> 01:35:49,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario Bros.

[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good one, too.

1231
01:36:11,358 --> 01:36:12,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking Donkey Kong Jr.

1232
01:36:12,579 --> 01:36:13,200
[SPEAKER_04]: and Donkey Kong.

1233
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:15,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1234
01:36:16,402 --> 01:36:27,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wish I'd played more of those pirated multi-carts because they had some Final Fantasy 7 and the Titanic game.

1235
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:30,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, yeah.

1236
01:36:30,233 --> 01:36:32,415
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some amazing garbage in those cards.

1237
01:36:32,675 --> 01:36:35,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Ramaditya Knight gives you some ideas there.

01:36:44,306 --> 01:36:45,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone ever play those?

1243
01:36:46,229 --> 01:36:47,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

1244
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:48,532
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was whack-a-mole with your feet.

1245
01:36:48,673 --> 01:36:49,494
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Eggsplode.

[SPEAKER_05]: I might have to do that, that's a pretty damn good deal I gotta tell you this much, we were clearing out some old inventory We had $50, I could buy you the DJ Hero 2 party set on the Wii Two turntables and a microphone at a game for $50 Is that where it's at?

1259
01:38:02,288 --> 01:38:04,809
[SPEAKER_05]: If I play it on the Wii, man, that's an awesome deal

1260
01:38:06,596 --> 01:38:09,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on, Tigerclaw tweets us a few things.

1261
01:38:10,699 --> 01:38:15,282
[SPEAKER_04]: One is a story about how Steam apparently has improved its content delivery system.

1262
01:38:16,063 --> 01:38:20,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Defense of the Ancients 2 will be making use of the new system when it comes out soon.

1263
01:38:21,066 --> 01:38:25,710
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently, yeah, it has to do with the fact that when new games come out on launch day from Steam...

1264
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:26,390
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1265
01:38:46,355 --> 01:39:05,787
[SPEAKER_04]: for those that have ISPs with monthly bandwidth caps Steam will no longer force you to download unnecessary data when a game is updated you will just download whatever's been changed rather than the entire files can't believe they weren't doing this before but that's a great improvement help cut back on some of the bandwidth overall

1266
01:39:06,407 --> 01:39:16,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can also get into download scheduling, bandwidth throttling, and the ability to prioritize the order that games are downloaded for updates and so forth.

1267
01:39:16,497 --> 01:39:18,339
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all coming to Steam very soon.

1268
01:39:18,899 --> 01:39:25,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, not everything on Steam will be able to use this right away, but Dota will be the first game to use it when it comes out soon.

1269
01:39:26,466 --> 01:39:29,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting that they're pegging that as a game to use it soon.

1270
01:39:29,509 --> 01:39:30,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea this game was...

1271
01:39:31,331 --> 01:39:31,792
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1272
01:39:43,228 --> 01:39:44,848
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has to do with Hideo Kojima.

1273
01:39:45,289 --> 01:39:46,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says, you know what?

1274
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:48,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have time for a new Snatcher game.

1275
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:50,950
[SPEAKER_04]: But if someone else wants to do it, great.

1276
01:39:51,590 --> 01:39:54,691
[SPEAKER_04]: So might be kind of opening the door there to a new Snatcher game.

1277
01:39:55,211 --> 01:39:59,012
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in an interview with PlayStation Blog when he was asked about games like L.A.

1278
01:39:59,072 --> 01:40:01,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire and Deus Ex Human Revolution.

1279
01:40:01,473 --> 01:40:02,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to make a new Snatcher game?

1280
01:40:03,053 --> 01:40:04,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Kojima said, quote, L.A.

1281
01:40:04,374 --> 01:40:07,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire is a game that I really like, but unfortunately I have not played it.

1282
01:40:09,675 --> 01:40:13,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is coming out in Japan today, so when I return, I intend to play it.

1283
01:40:13,897 --> 01:40:20,560
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea of an open world in 3D is very good, and I would love to do something like Snatcher, but I do not have the time or the means to do so.

1284
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:24,381
[SPEAKER_04]: But if anyone else would like to develop it, I would love it.

1285
01:40:25,162 --> 01:40:28,243
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Team Bondi, you might need to give Hideo Kojima a call.

1286
01:40:28,903 --> 01:40:31,904
[SPEAKER_04]: You might not even have to work 100-hour work weeks to get that game done.

1287
01:40:32,144 --> 01:40:32,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1288
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:33,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow...

1289
01:40:34,065 --> 01:40:35,506
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.

1290
01:40:35,546 --> 01:40:38,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to get your tweets in for next week.

1291
01:40:38,507 --> 01:40:40,127
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, back to gaming news.

1292
01:40:40,487 --> 01:40:42,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Your phone calls in about 30 minutes here on OLR.

1293
01:40:42,788 --> 01:40:44,509
[SPEAKER_04]: The mailbag's coming up soon as well.

1294
01:40:45,149 --> 01:40:46,650
[SPEAKER_04]: FUs of the week and all that stuff you love.

1295
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:47,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1296
01:40:48,499 --> 01:40:50,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this is kind of neat.

1297
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:53,263
[SPEAKER_05]: EA bought PopCap.

1298
01:40:53,443 --> 01:40:58,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, thank God it wasn't Zynga, which they were in the running, by the way.

1299
01:40:59,549 --> 01:41:03,312
[SPEAKER_05]: EA purchased PopCap games for $750 million.

1300
01:41:03,552 --> 01:41:12,240
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also, of course, there are some bonuses, including some performance bonuses, I guess.

1301
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:13,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, PopCap!

1302
01:41:35,270 --> 01:41:36,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1303
01:41:54,378 --> 01:41:55,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that is kind of bad.

1304
01:42:20,925 --> 01:42:24,007
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1305
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:39,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants vs. Zombies.

1306
01:42:39,558 --> 01:42:42,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Name me one thing you can't play Plants vs. Zombies on.

1307
01:42:43,042 --> 01:42:43,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1308
01:42:45,324 --> 01:42:48,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe an old Nokia phone and an Atari 2600.

1309
01:42:48,367 --> 01:42:49,167
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably it.

1310
01:42:49,187 --> 01:42:51,469
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would bet somebody's probably tried to port it to the 2600.

1311
01:42:56,454 --> 01:42:58,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, yeah, you can play that well because there's a Quest.

1312
01:42:59,378 --> 01:43:16,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace Bloom vs. Ghouls I have my Peace Bloom They'll remove that quest from a while I'm keeping my Peace Bloom You better not take my Peace Bloom I don't think they will I love my stupid singing flower I actually hate those fucking flowers that sing You'll be walking through Stormwind

1313
01:43:19,684 --> 01:43:20,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut the fuck up.

1314
01:43:20,925 --> 01:43:23,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a torch to set those things on fire.

1315
01:43:23,225 --> 01:43:28,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Why couldn't they give us one of the plants that look like Audrey?

1316
01:43:28,227 --> 01:43:29,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a zombie to eat that plant.

1317
01:43:29,808 --> 01:43:30,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I digress.

1318
01:43:32,829 --> 01:43:36,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess if it's a good business thing for PopCap, then yay, winners.

1319
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:38,851
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's always going to be that part of me that's a little bit nervous.

1320
01:43:39,651 --> 01:43:41,672
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit nervous about what the future has.

1321
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:50,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakroom in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com If Zynga bought PopCap games, I would still be crying.

1322
01:43:51,784 --> 01:43:55,026
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, you know EA is going to be milking those PopCap games.

1323
01:43:56,207 --> 01:43:58,088
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, Peggle Battlefield.

1324
01:43:59,009 --> 01:44:00,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it'll get that bad.

1325
01:44:01,693 --> 01:44:08,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I think EA just kind of wants something to fall back on if their games, you know, it's not like EA doesn't have a humongous library of games.

1326
01:44:09,657 --> 01:44:14,099
[SPEAKER_04]: But if, you know, it's nice to have some proven winners in their hat.

1327
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:24,264
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would maybe be the best news out of all with this is that if EA knows they've got a winner in their back pocket, then maybe they'll experiment with some new stuff.

1328
01:44:24,424 --> 01:44:31,268
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, I mean, I'm sure that's just wishful thinking on my part, but forgive me for being a dreamer.

1329
01:44:33,342 --> 01:44:35,203
[SPEAKER_10]: People say you're a dreamer, but you're not the only one.

1330
01:44:35,223 --> 01:44:36,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the only one, exactly.

1331
01:44:37,424 --> 01:44:38,605
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

1332
01:44:40,065 --> 01:44:44,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, this is another story that's kind of about Zynga and it's about EA.

1333
01:44:44,207 --> 01:44:45,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting how these things come full circle.

1334
01:44:46,228 --> 01:44:50,110
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about the NBA Jam creator, Mark Turmel.

1335
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:58,695
[SPEAKER_04]: He created the NBA Jam series that recently came back last year, although it kind of came back with a... Hopefully the arcade ones this year will be a little better.

1336
01:44:59,155 --> 01:45:00,836
[SPEAKER_04]: He has left EA Sports.

1337
01:45:00,996 --> 01:45:02,116
[SPEAKER_04]: You know where he works now?

1338
01:45:02,637 --> 01:45:02,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Zynga.

1339
01:45:04,753 --> 01:45:11,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so he now works at Zynga, so who knows what he's gonna create for them over there.

1340
01:45:11,531 --> 01:45:13,276
[SPEAKER_10]: He was assimilated into their collective.

1341
01:45:14,028 --> 01:45:16,929
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the senior creative director at EA when he left.

1342
01:45:17,669 --> 01:45:21,089
[SPEAKER_04]: NBA Jam is not the only thing he works on, but some other projects as well.

1343
01:45:22,389 --> 01:45:27,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there were rumors about a return of NFL Blitz when this guy worked at Midway.

1344
01:45:28,150 --> 01:45:31,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And then EA bought the Blitz property when Midway was going out of business.

1345
01:45:31,911 --> 01:45:37,512
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know if that'll happen now or maybe it'll just happen without this guy overseeing the project anymore.

1346
01:45:38,032 --> 01:45:39,932
[SPEAKER_04]: EA has confirmed his departure.

1347
01:45:40,553 --> 01:45:42,993
[SPEAKER_04]: No word at what exactly he's going to help design at Zynga.

1348
01:45:44,498 --> 01:46:06,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know like I'm really trying to look at both sides about Zynga but don't does anyone else think Zynga's days are really numbered and it's not just about the whole like fact that their games are laughably bad when it comes to things like Farmville and so forth despite the fact that tons and tons of people play them but I feel like if Facebook goes down Zynga is fucked

1349
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:08,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Zynga has yet to establish.

1350
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:12,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know they like to say in their press releases, well, people could just come to Zynga.com and play.

1351
01:46:12,991 --> 01:46:13,812
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's going to do it.

1352
01:46:14,612 --> 01:46:17,712
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to be nearly the company you are thanks to Facebook.

1353
01:46:18,053 --> 01:46:21,573
[SPEAKER_04]: What if Google Plus rolls out games and says, you know what?

1354
01:46:22,173 --> 01:46:28,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we don't like the Zynga games ever either and we've become the safe haven for nerds, we're not going to partner with Zynga.

1355
01:46:28,955 --> 01:46:33,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Zynga is not allowed to put their games on Facebook or on Google Plus, excuse me.

1356
01:46:33,576 --> 01:46:42,784
[SPEAKER_04]: or maybe Google Plus will come out and say sure we're going to have games but it's not showing up in the stream or it's not going to do the same thing that Facebook did where it shows up in feeds.

1357
01:46:43,444 --> 01:46:45,666
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be like how I think how Yahoo games were.

1358
01:46:46,527 --> 01:46:47,828
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just its own section.

1359
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:48,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1360
01:46:48,949 --> 01:46:50,470
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can go to that.

1361
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:52,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it'll be how most people I think would prefer to see it.

1362
01:46:53,032 --> 01:46:57,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't keep it off my stream but you can have some cool games in their own little game section.

1363
01:46:57,456 --> 01:46:59,117
[SPEAKER_10]: I played Lexiolus for the longest time.

1364
01:46:59,437 --> 01:46:59,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1365
01:46:59,818 --> 01:47:00,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1366
01:47:01,618 --> 01:47:02,979
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be very interesting.

1367
01:47:03,859 --> 01:47:14,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I'm also glad to see PopCap didn't go with Zynga, although for Zynga's benefit, that would have been a huge win for them because at least PopCap can prove that they've done a bunch of other stuff in the other place.

1368
01:47:15,183 --> 01:47:16,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's at least that.

1369
01:47:17,764 --> 01:47:20,125
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so let's move on with another story.

1370
01:47:20,325 --> 01:47:21,425
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1371
01:47:22,725 --> 01:47:26,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what I have is actually a little bit more...

1372
01:47:33,178 --> 01:47:33,559
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that?

1373
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:43,204
[SPEAKER_10]: EA is going to be doing another bit of online service shutdowns taking down a bunch of multiplayer games and demos.

1374
01:47:44,264 --> 01:47:47,306
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Army of Two, bye.

1375
01:47:48,948 --> 01:48:12,082
[SPEAKER_10]: TheDemo, Bye, Battlefield 2142, Bye, Battlefield 2, Modern Combat, Demo, Medal of Honor Airborne, Medal of Honor Heroes 2, NASCAR 09, NCAA Basketball 10, NCAA Football 10, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Need for Speed Undercover, Skate for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Tiger Woods, PGA Tour 10 and 11.

1376
01:48:13,803 --> 01:48:19,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are all going down on August 11th And on October 1st, Madden NFL 10 and NHL 10

1377
01:48:22,179 --> 01:48:25,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks to be the guy that paid $10 to play those games online yesterday.

1378
01:48:25,783 --> 01:48:26,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, bye.

1379
01:48:27,224 --> 01:48:27,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1380
01:48:27,745 --> 01:48:42,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously those games were out well before the whole $10 thing took off, but can't wait to see when the inevitable next wave of server shutdowns comes out and something that you paid $10 because you bought it used a couple years after the fact to play online suddenly shuts down.

1381
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:43,040
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

1382
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:44,162
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll go over real well.

1383
01:48:44,682 --> 01:48:48,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, at least most of those games are like old sequels, you know what I mean?

1384
01:48:48,743 --> 01:48:51,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they're old games and series that have newer sequels.

1385
01:48:52,224 --> 01:48:53,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And they probably have a good point.

1386
01:48:53,705 --> 01:48:55,585
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's playing those games online anymore.

1387
01:48:56,425 --> 01:49:03,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're not exactly, people are going to cry over them, but it's going to be very interesting when we get to the $10 games.

1388
01:49:03,808 --> 01:49:04,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1389
01:49:04,468 --> 01:49:04,888
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1390
01:49:06,608 --> 01:49:06,868
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1391
01:49:07,669 --> 01:49:08,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what do you have for us?

1392
01:49:09,023 --> 01:49:09,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, yes.

1393
01:49:09,964 --> 01:49:14,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I hate when they shut down stuff.

1394
01:49:15,027 --> 01:49:15,768
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of cool.

1395
01:49:17,009 --> 01:49:20,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I haven't really ever played this in the arcade, but I'm definitely familiar with the music.

1396
01:49:20,952 --> 01:49:28,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune is coming to arcades, number four, that is, in December in Japan.

1397
01:49:29,438 --> 01:49:35,062
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm assuming we can expect more of the wonderful music in there.

1398
01:49:35,782 --> 01:49:39,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the stuff that they are going to be adding.

1399
01:49:40,244 --> 01:49:41,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Connected Ghost Battle Mode.

1400
01:49:41,984 --> 01:49:44,285
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll be able to battle ghost records around the world.

1401
01:49:45,045 --> 01:49:47,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can challenge the top ghosts in the world.

1402
01:49:49,127 --> 01:49:49,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1403
01:49:49,487 --> 01:49:50,967
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also going to have a team function.

1404
01:49:50,987 --> 01:49:52,188
[SPEAKER_05]: You can create your own teams.

1405
01:49:52,268 --> 01:49:54,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Put team-specific stickers on your cars.

1406
01:49:55,189 --> 01:49:58,290
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure if that's going to make the international version.

1407
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:00,531
[SPEAKER_05]: New cars, including the Mazda RX-7.

1408
01:50:02,032 --> 01:50:22,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Mitsubishi Starion, Nissan Skyline Coupe V36, Infiniti G37 Coupe, RUF CTR Yellowbird, RUF RGT, Subaru Legacy B4 5th Generation, Toyota Crown 13th Generation, and yet unannounced car.

1409
01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:28,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Also some new courses, Yokohama Line and Yesu Route.

1410
01:50:28,995 --> 01:50:29,055
[SPEAKER_05]: 830HP

1411
01:50:47,933 --> 01:51:09,322
[SPEAKER_05]: so uh that's kind of cool I mean I don't know I I know that there's definitely in the arcade scene nowadays it's all about racing games um I mean that's really popular so it'll be kind of cool hopefully this stuff makes it over here yeah it'd be nice uh as I was saying at the top of the show that's a pretty awesome racing series so I do hope we see that show up over here

1412
01:51:10,953 --> 01:51:12,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Charles Smith, Professor of Family Studies, Kansas State University

1413
01:51:26,874 --> 01:51:33,478
[SPEAKER_04]: He says that there's this big hysteria about violence in video games, but it's context and the type of game that's important.

1414
01:51:33,838 --> 01:51:35,499
[SPEAKER_04]: The type of child is important as well.

1415
01:51:35,539 --> 01:51:36,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a quote.

1416
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:46,086
[SPEAKER_04]: A child without a connected parent relationship, one who doesn't have respect for their parents and plays a violent video game over a certain length of time, would worry me.

1417
01:51:46,447 --> 01:51:49,949
[SPEAKER_04]: But banning video games completely isn't the right answer either.

1418
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:55,653
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes on to say that banning games might make them more attractive to children.

1419
01:51:56,653 --> 01:52:00,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, the realism in video games is changing constantly because of technology.

1420
01:52:01,076 --> 01:52:06,760
[SPEAKER_04]: This causes more realistic violence and video games are becoming more and more immersive in terms of their nature.

1421
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:12,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's talking about how, you know, the technology is always changing and this can kind of be a concern.

1422
01:52:12,443 --> 01:52:19,047
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately, at the end of the day, he says that parents, they need to be educated, they need to be aware about what games they're letting their children play.

1423
01:52:19,407 --> 01:52:21,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Without that parent-child relationship...

1424
01:52:22,369 --> 01:52:23,189
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1425
01:52:49,435 --> 01:52:50,576
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows what he's talking about.

1426
01:52:50,817 --> 01:52:51,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1427
01:52:51,277 --> 01:52:59,104
[SPEAKER_04]: We need him to go against Leland Yee in what is needed for kids and so forth.

1428
01:53:01,466 --> 01:53:01,767
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1429
01:53:02,828 --> 01:53:07,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with the mailbag and see what offensive things you guys are going to email us this week.

1430
01:53:09,423 --> 01:53:15,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com is the place to email us every week and DarkSakura will dive in head first and read some emails for us.

1431
01:53:15,968 --> 01:53:16,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

1432
01:53:17,069 --> 01:53:17,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I have some.

1433
01:53:17,989 --> 01:53:19,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I have four emails.

1434
01:53:20,351 --> 01:53:21,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, four?

1435
01:53:22,313 --> 01:53:22,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

1436
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:28,681
[SPEAKER_10]: But first of all, person, you misspelled Voltaire.

1437
01:53:28,801 --> 01:53:30,521
[SPEAKER_10]: It's V-O-L-T-A-I-R-E.

1438
01:53:31,342 --> 01:53:34,923
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're going to quote somebody, which, quoting Voltaire is fine by me.

1439
01:53:35,223 --> 01:53:36,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you spell it right, please.

1440
01:53:37,143 --> 01:53:38,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag, hi, we haven't spoken in a while.

1441
01:53:38,864 --> 01:53:40,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to let you in on this.

1442
01:53:40,204 --> 01:53:43,045
[SPEAKER_10]: I came ahead quite a bit since I started a week ago.

1443
01:53:43,125 --> 01:53:43,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Just have a read.

1444
01:53:45,366 --> 01:53:46,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that a spam email?

1445
01:53:46,706 --> 01:53:47,026
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1446
01:53:48,847 --> 01:53:50,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you that's a spam email.

1447
01:53:50,608 --> 01:53:53,708
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to watch out for that shit.

1448
01:53:53,728 --> 01:53:55,369
[SPEAKER_04]: We get tons of spam in the email box.

1449
01:53:56,010 --> 01:54:22,814
[SPEAKER_10]: well I I should just ignore bad grammar anyway okay hello comrades I'm sorry it's funny that that still was signed with something that they're quoting a philosopher I find that funny I'm sorry three emails hello comrades I hope that all of you are doing well firstly I wanted to thank you for the great show very entertaining just like shooting an AK while intoxicated just joking I don't drink

1450
01:54:24,454 --> 01:54:27,236
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you guys think of the future of GTA?

1451
01:54:27,256 --> 01:54:29,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Will the next installment be as serious and realistic, a.k.a.

1452
01:54:29,878 --> 01:54:31,399
[SPEAKER_10]: gray and muddy as the previous one?

1453
01:54:31,959 --> 01:54:36,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Or will it perhaps return to a much more hilarious style like San Andreas with much more customization and humor?

1454
01:54:37,903 --> 01:54:40,104
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really a Loki question, if anything.

1455
01:54:40,665 --> 01:54:45,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I know you're rocking out over there, but Grand Theft Auto, what would the next one be like?

1456
01:54:45,408 --> 01:54:46,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it be serious or whimsical?

1457
01:54:47,585 --> 01:54:52,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they're going to try to bring back what they did in San Andreas.

1458
01:54:52,207 --> 01:55:01,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, kind of keeping it grounded a little bit, but have a little bit of extra fun stuff like the miniguns and the parachutes and a little bit of ridiculous stuff.

1459
01:55:01,570 --> 01:55:14,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they've got to step it up a little bit as far as whimsical and crazy because of Saints Row the Third, but I still think they're going to try to keep it a little bit somewhat realistic, you know?

1460
01:55:15,476 --> 01:55:18,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're definitely going to see kind of like a Sandra is.

1461
01:55:19,926 --> 01:55:20,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty.

1462
01:55:22,747 --> 01:55:48,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope they get rid of the I kind of call it like dating your friends where oh hey let's go bowling or hey I want to go play air hockey I don't want to fucking play air hockey with you I want ho mode DarkSakura I'm with you I want more hoes I want ho mode where you play as a whore I think there needs to be a mode where when she says I want to go play air hockey you should say shut up bitch and suck my dick

1463
01:55:49,372 --> 01:55:49,632
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

1464
01:55:50,192 --> 01:55:50,832
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

1465
01:55:51,113 --> 01:55:57,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is why Saints Row, in some ways, is a better game than Grand Theft Auto.

1466
01:55:57,715 --> 01:56:00,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Saints Row 2 does have whore mode, where you can play as a whore.

1467
01:56:00,816 --> 01:56:04,597
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be a man whore, and you can go... Oh my god, why am I not playing this game?

1468
01:56:05,197 --> 01:56:06,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It's serious.

1469
01:56:06,297 --> 01:56:07,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the side missions you can do.

1470
01:56:07,498 --> 01:56:10,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the first Saints Row and I was like, yeah, whatever.

1471
01:56:10,179 --> 01:56:11,639
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you need to play Saints Row 2.

1472
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:12,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I borrow it?

1473
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:14,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1474
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:15,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to be a man-whore.

1475
01:56:15,701 --> 01:56:16,621
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1476
01:56:16,841 --> 01:56:17,861
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fucking awesome game.

1477
01:56:17,881 --> 01:56:21,562
[SPEAKER_10]: You can borrow it when you lend me Dance Masters.

1478
01:56:22,043 --> 01:56:22,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1479
01:56:23,383 --> 01:56:24,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, bitch.

1480
01:56:24,363 --> 01:56:25,404
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I'm practicing.

1481
01:56:25,424 --> 01:56:25,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey-ho.

1482
01:56:25,904 --> 01:56:29,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you play as a man-whore?

1483
01:56:29,485 --> 01:56:30,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Big Bang Bar A Little More To The Left

1484
01:56:52,532 --> 01:57:05,675
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's seriously, they have scenes where they have a mode where, I don't even remember what the hell it's called, it's basically you in one of those bunny suits, you know how they have the bunny suits, Intel and stuff like that?

1485
01:57:06,055 --> 01:57:10,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Right in ATV, on fire, and everything you run into explodes!

1486
01:57:10,436 --> 01:57:12,277
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just such an awesome game!

1487
01:57:12,737 --> 01:57:13,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1488
01:57:13,277 --> 01:57:20,442
[SPEAKER_04]: If this game convinced Loki to get a gold star in man-whoring, I've got to check it out.

1489
01:57:20,843 --> 01:57:21,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll loan it to you.

1490
01:57:21,923 --> 01:57:22,804
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty awesome.

1491
01:57:22,904 --> 01:57:26,206
[SPEAKER_05]: But the third, man, the third's going to be even better than this.

1492
01:57:27,387 --> 01:57:29,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't fathom how awesome this is going to be.

1493
01:57:29,529 --> 01:57:29,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't wait.

1494
01:57:32,099 --> 01:57:32,339
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1495
01:57:32,679 --> 01:57:33,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there more to the email?

1496
01:57:33,559 --> 01:57:33,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1497
01:57:33,819 --> 01:57:34,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there is.

1498
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,740
[SPEAKER_04]: We're stuck thinking about hosts.

1499
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:38,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to inform you guys of this great game I played as a kid.

1500
01:57:38,981 --> 01:57:40,021
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Dark Earth.

1501
01:57:40,141 --> 01:57:43,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I want to see how old this is if he said he played it as a kid.

1502
01:57:46,242 --> 01:57:48,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it links to something in archaeology.

1503
01:57:48,843 --> 01:57:49,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Never mind.

1504
01:57:49,343 --> 01:57:49,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the video game.

1505
01:57:51,064 --> 01:57:51,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find it.

1506
01:57:51,564 --> 01:57:51,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1507
01:57:52,064 --> 01:57:55,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Post-apocalyptic action adventure game for the PC.

1508
01:57:55,345 --> 01:57:56,285
[SPEAKER_10]: When did it come out?

1509
01:57:59,586 --> 01:58:00,686
[SPEAKER_10]: It was canceled for PS2.

1510
01:58:04,113 --> 01:58:20,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Earth, 1997 September 30th, 1997 You were a kid in 97, shut the fuck up I'm not reading any more of this Don't be mean to the emailers It featured an amazing story and the graphics were pretty impressive at the time If you have the time, check it out, you won't regret it Stay frost, comrades, Stanislav

1511
01:58:22,749 --> 01:58:23,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reading up on this game.

1512
01:58:23,490 --> 01:58:24,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually never played this.

1513
01:58:24,430 --> 01:58:25,591
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a PC only game.

1514
01:58:25,671 --> 01:58:27,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember this game actually.

1515
01:58:27,332 --> 01:58:27,872
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen it before.

1516
01:58:27,892 --> 01:58:28,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you really?

1517
01:58:28,892 --> 01:58:29,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I never played this.

1518
01:58:30,593 --> 01:58:34,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Third person game centering around item collection and weapon based combat.

1519
01:58:35,656 --> 01:58:40,539
[SPEAKER_04]: The environments of the game were pre-rendered with 3D modeled characters moving atop them like Resident Evil.

1520
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:42,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1521
01:58:43,274 --> 01:58:43,854
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty neat.

1522
01:58:44,735 --> 01:58:45,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I will have to check it out.

1523
01:58:46,256 --> 01:58:50,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email comes from... Thanks for the game, by the way.

1524
01:58:51,879 --> 01:58:52,380
[SPEAKER_10]: The next one.

1525
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,241
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was saying thanks for the game.

1526
01:58:54,661 --> 01:58:55,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I read the damn email.

1527
01:58:59,984 --> 01:59:02,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Did any of you see the Forza 4 trailer on Xbox Live?

1528
01:59:02,865 --> 01:59:03,005
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1529
01:59:03,545 --> 01:59:05,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched it and it starts with this claim.

1530
01:59:05,386 --> 01:59:06,406
[SPEAKER_10]: All in-game footage.

1531
01:59:06,666 --> 01:59:13,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, unless I'm wrong, it shows you the CG render intro to the game followed by footage from the game which I'm not sure looks any different than Forza 3.

1532
01:59:14,129 --> 01:59:19,090
[SPEAKER_10]: CG renders are not in-game footage even if they are part of the game media.

1533
01:59:19,611 --> 01:59:25,072
[SPEAKER_10]: The only way that could be in-game footage is if there was a special car viewer section that does nothing else.

1534
01:59:25,673 --> 01:59:26,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if that is what it is.

1535
01:59:30,584 --> 01:59:34,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the one that blasted the Kanye West song when you watched the trailer?

1536
01:59:34,226 --> 01:59:34,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't watch it.

1537
01:59:35,046 --> 01:59:37,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I did see it.

1538
01:59:37,287 --> 01:59:42,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Racing games always have, at least these days, have pretty impressive graphics.

1539
01:59:42,210 --> 01:59:44,571
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it goes by so fast you can't really appreciate it.

1540
01:59:45,252 --> 01:59:51,355
[SPEAKER_10]: I also have to paste how Rob signed his email because you'll only get it if you know DOS.

1541
01:59:52,256 --> 01:59:52,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God.

1542
01:59:53,868 --> 01:59:54,348
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

1543
01:59:54,488 --> 01:59:54,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1544
01:59:54,928 --> 01:59:55,309
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

1545
01:59:55,829 --> 01:59:58,310
[SPEAKER_10]: And to read it out for the listeners, 10 print, Rob.

1546
01:59:59,351 --> 02:00:00,071
[SPEAKER_10]: 20 print, B.

1547
02:00:00,731 --> 02:00:01,231
[SPEAKER_10]: 30, go to 20.

1548
02:00:01,692 --> 02:00:02,952
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, that's basic, not DOS.

1549
02:00:03,212 --> 02:00:04,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, you know what I mean.

1550
02:00:04,193 --> 02:00:04,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know.

1551
02:00:06,334 --> 02:00:09,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an icon that says the home sweet home one.

1552
02:00:10,022 --> 02:00:12,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a lot of time on Commodore 64 Basic in my youth.

1553
02:00:13,665 --> 02:00:16,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, you kids were playing Dark Earth.

1554
02:00:16,308 --> 02:00:17,689
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was a kid, I was typing.

1555
02:00:17,729 --> 02:00:18,910
[SPEAKER_10]: What were the commands?

1556
02:00:19,110 --> 02:00:26,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Run, quote, game, quote, comma, eight, comma, no, asterisk, A, asterisk, B.

1557
02:00:27,421 --> 02:00:28,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Earth Dark Earth Dark Earth Dark Earth

1558
02:00:43,803 --> 02:00:46,564
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to have one of those that you play games on.

1559
02:00:47,624 --> 02:00:49,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, last email.

1560
02:00:49,465 --> 02:00:50,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Dun, dun, dun.

1561
02:00:52,325 --> 02:00:52,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, gang.

1562
02:00:52,985 --> 02:00:55,606
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Ramaditya.

1563
02:00:56,426 --> 02:00:57,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope I said that right.

1564
02:00:57,867 --> 02:01:03,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I spoke to Rob earlier, and as a blind gamer, I would like to give my personal thoughts about one of the topics brought up in the last show.

1565
02:01:03,928 --> 02:01:07,729
[SPEAKER_10]: It is about an invention that can help blind persons see, use, and connect as assistive device.

1566
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:09,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked for an email like this.

1567
02:01:09,210 --> 02:01:09,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

1568
02:01:10,083 --> 02:01:14,044
[SPEAKER_10]: However, because my English vocabularies are somewhat limited, I'll try to explain it as best I can.

1569
02:01:14,104 --> 02:01:15,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you can catch what I mean.

1570
02:01:15,705 --> 02:01:16,845
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what I understand.

1571
02:01:17,266 --> 02:01:21,227
[SPEAKER_10]: In order to make the connect work, it needs to recognize the visual objects it points to.

1572
02:01:21,647 --> 02:01:28,990
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, if I want to know that there is a glass in front of me, I must point my connect to it, and an audio message will tell me there is a glass.

1573
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:37,413
[SPEAKER_10]: It means that my connect must have proper information about the object so that it can recognize it properly, so the object must contain something special that the connect can recognize.

1574
02:01:38,033 --> 02:01:43,395
[SPEAKER_10]: With this aid, we are faced with the circumstance that visual objects are a lot, color, shape, letters, etc.

1575
02:01:43,955 --> 02:01:47,917
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is probably impossible for the device to recognize all of them.

1576
02:01:48,457 --> 02:01:54,339
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, if I stand in front of the mall, it will be difficult for the device to identify various activities in front of me.

1577
02:01:54,659 --> 02:01:56,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Walking people, running children, moving trolley, etc.

1578
02:01:57,780 --> 02:02:04,402
[SPEAKER_10]: So the device may not be able to replace working eyes, but there is still a way to make the device useful and more effectively.

1579
02:02:04,982 --> 02:02:08,644
[SPEAKER_10]: We need a specific object that can universally be recognized.

1580
02:02:09,044 --> 02:02:11,845
[SPEAKER_10]: What a coincidence that the idea came from Rob himself.

1581
02:02:12,185 --> 02:02:13,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, QR code can be one.

1582
02:02:14,005 --> 02:02:18,467
[SPEAKER_10]: That's basically QR code usually contains text or number, and those are universal, e.g.

1583
02:02:18,527 --> 02:02:25,169
[SPEAKER_10]: the numbers are number 9 is the same around the world, letter A is also the same, and many other examples that you can make yourself.

1584
02:02:25,829 --> 02:02:30,093
[SPEAKER_10]: So we use the device like a reading tool or transportation recognizer, and it's like what Rob told.

1585
02:02:30,513 --> 02:02:36,698
[SPEAKER_10]: When it scans the QR code attached to the bus, it would speak, bus to Canada goes at 7 a.m.

1586
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:41,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Another example, the inventor can install a small GPS so that it can help blind people navigate easily.

1587
02:02:42,143 --> 02:02:49,749
[SPEAKER_10]: You are facing north, the device says, and when you walk straight, it finds a QR code embedded at the next exit door that will read, northern exit, go south to Dunkin' Donuts.

1588
02:02:51,029 --> 02:02:59,592
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to implement Kinect as a gaming device which is accessible for the blind, perhaps bodily movement can be considered as a universal target that the device can recognize.

1589
02:03:00,052 --> 02:03:10,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps when you play one-on-one lightsaber battle, both players can face each other and use Kinect like a lightsaber, and the device held by the blind player can inform the position or movement his or her opponent makes.

1590
02:03:10,695 --> 02:03:12,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Combined with the sound effects from the game, it can be great.

1591
02:03:13,916 --> 02:03:20,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Another possible implementation is to use the device in card games like, well I forget, but there was that one PS3 one which came out with the physical cards.

1592
02:03:21,602 --> 02:03:21,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

1593
02:03:22,442 --> 02:03:22,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I have judgment.

1594
02:03:23,183 --> 02:03:23,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1595
02:03:24,583 --> 02:03:29,046
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the one where you all bet if I could sell one million and Loki must dress as Tingle?

1596
02:03:29,427 --> 02:03:30,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, correct.

1597
02:03:30,527 --> 02:03:38,993
[SPEAKER_10]: The physical cards must contain label or QR code that tells Kinect which cards the player holds so the player can use it properly based on information given by Kinect.

1598
02:03:39,033 --> 02:03:42,896
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, this is dragon card facing up, this is golem card facing down, etc.

1599
02:03:43,856 --> 02:03:48,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, that's my personal thought about the topic, but I do support whatever result may come out.

1600
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:51,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, before I conclude this email, let me give you my YouTube video.

1601
02:03:51,903 --> 02:03:53,604
[SPEAKER_10]: It's me playing Frog's Theme with my recorder.

1602
02:03:54,204 --> 02:03:56,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope you and all you listeners can enjoy it.

1603
02:03:57,587 --> 02:03:59,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't he send us a recorder link before?

1604
02:03:59,568 --> 02:04:00,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I remember this guy.

1605
02:04:00,329 --> 02:04:01,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to copy it to you, Rob.

1606
02:04:01,570 --> 02:04:02,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, do that.

1607
02:04:02,391 --> 02:04:03,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll bring it up here real quick.

1608
02:04:03,912 --> 02:04:04,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1609
02:04:06,923 --> 02:04:16,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first off, I think if I understood the point of the email correctly, it was that I'm a genius for my idea with the QR codes last week, so I totally agree with the email 100%, might I say.

1610
02:04:17,246 --> 02:04:17,907
[SPEAKER_04]: You're so awful.

1611
02:04:18,687 --> 02:04:23,688
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do have to say, if English isn't your first language, you still did a fantastic job.

1612
02:04:24,289 --> 02:04:26,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, you did better than some people who email us.

1613
02:04:26,229 --> 02:04:30,590
[SPEAKER_10]: You did better than people who have grown up here all of their lives, so thank you for being awesome.

1614
02:04:30,790 --> 02:04:31,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me bring this up a little bit.

1615
02:04:43,487 --> 02:04:46,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that because you know he's got a deep appreciation for this game.

1616
02:04:46,508 --> 02:04:52,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I want to say the last video I saw of him playing the recorder was like Scars of Time, I think it was.

1617
02:04:52,471 --> 02:04:52,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.

1618
02:04:52,951 --> 02:04:54,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So clearly this kid loves his chrono.

1619
02:04:54,832 --> 02:04:56,273
[SPEAKER_04]: He played it with the music and everything.

1620
02:04:56,393 --> 02:04:57,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he loves his chrono.

1621
02:04:57,714 --> 02:05:02,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's great that even though he's blind, he kind of has that appreciation.

1622
02:05:02,636 --> 02:05:08,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's hard for a lot of us to understand sometimes what it's like in that position.

1623
02:05:08,899 --> 02:05:09,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1624
02:05:10,940 --> 02:05:15,121
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly, I can also agree that kind of what he says at the end of the email.

1625
02:05:15,181 --> 02:05:20,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, anything that will help is a good thing, right?

1626
02:05:20,543 --> 02:05:33,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, see, this is kind of actually... It's funny because I was actually having this thought about the use of QR codes to provide...

1627
02:05:36,107 --> 02:05:37,528
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1628
02:06:00,408 --> 02:06:09,516
[SPEAKER_10]: or even like an iPhone app that you can hold up your phone, read the code, and it'll have a speaker attached to it that says so-and-so or record voice signal or something.

1629
02:06:11,118 --> 02:06:11,498
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

1630
02:06:12,339 --> 02:06:15,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have all these technologies now, like the QR code.

1631
02:06:16,342 --> 02:06:19,585
[SPEAKER_04]: GPS is so cheap to implement in devices now, too.

1632
02:06:19,765 --> 02:06:21,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're just a matter of time away.

1633
02:06:22,007 --> 02:06:28,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to tell you, though, and I'd actually like to get some of our blind listeners' feedback on this, too.

1634
02:06:29,172 --> 02:06:38,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched a special probably a couple years ago about using audio location to be able to tell distance.

1635
02:06:39,881 --> 02:06:50,494
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a guy blind from birth riding a bicycle down a street that had cars all around, people crossing the street, and making clicking noises.

1636
02:06:51,315 --> 02:06:55,800
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was able to tell his location and what was close to him by the clicking sound.

1637
02:06:56,541 --> 02:06:57,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was thinking, you know...

1638
02:06:59,144 --> 02:06:59,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1639
02:07:16,879 --> 02:07:17,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1640
02:07:17,099 --> 02:07:17,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy thought.

1641
02:07:17,559 --> 02:07:17,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1642
02:07:37,506 --> 02:07:42,912
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, just real quick, some folks are requesting the video so that they could watch it at full volume.

1643
02:07:42,972 --> 02:07:44,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a link right there in chat.

1644
02:07:44,233 --> 02:07:44,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I put that there.

1645
02:07:45,374 --> 02:07:50,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to those folks that are listening on the podcast feed, but you'll just have to do a search for that.

1646
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:51,781
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it labeled as?

1647
02:07:52,942 --> 02:07:54,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see what it's labeled as real quick here.

1648
02:07:55,748 --> 02:07:56,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the last email, by the way?

1649
02:07:56,989 --> 02:07:57,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it was.

1650
02:07:57,449 --> 02:07:58,389
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that was the last email.

1651
02:08:00,771 --> 02:08:10,536
[SPEAKER_04]: The name on YouTube is Ramaditya Skywalker, R-A-M-A-D-I-T-Y-A Skywalker, S-K-Y-W-A-L-K-E-R.

1652
02:08:11,016 --> 02:08:11,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1653
02:08:11,557 --> 02:08:18,640
[SPEAKER_04]: You can look that up, and I'm sure, I think he probably has, it's 61 videos, so who knows what else is in there, but I'm assuming there's a lot of recorder stuff in there.

1654
02:08:19,101 --> 02:08:19,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.

1655
02:08:21,007 --> 02:08:23,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, yeah, Tin Whistle, Ship, yeah, he's got some other videos too.

1656
02:08:24,008 --> 02:08:24,708
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a Tin Whistle.

1657
02:08:24,728 --> 02:08:25,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I have two of them.

1658
02:08:25,849 --> 02:08:26,709
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm not any good at it.

1659
02:08:28,490 --> 02:08:28,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

1660
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:30,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I should learn to play my melodica.

1661
02:08:30,870 --> 02:08:32,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we could do a YouTube duet.

1662
02:08:32,251 --> 02:08:32,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Do a duet?

1663
02:08:33,211 --> 02:08:33,611
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome.

1664
02:08:35,612 --> 02:08:36,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it for the Mailbag.

1665
02:08:36,892 --> 02:08:41,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send in your emails for a future week.

1666
02:08:41,634 --> 02:08:43,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, let's get to the FUs of the week.

1667
02:09:00,675 --> 02:09:08,940
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to say F you to my skin for not getting quite as much sun as I wanted today.

1668
02:09:11,102 --> 02:09:15,344
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am happy to say that I don't have skin cancer yet.

1669
02:09:16,705 --> 02:09:17,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah.

1670
02:09:20,131 --> 02:09:21,052
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to people being sick.

1672
02:10:10,185 --> 02:10:14,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the reason why I'm actually, and I hate to plug.

1673
02:10:14,486 --> 02:10:16,007
[SPEAKER_04]: An F you to the outro playing right there.

1674
02:10:16,027 --> 02:10:18,648
[SPEAKER_10]: To plug, you know, because they're not paying us clearly.

1675
02:10:19,208 --> 02:10:25,610
[SPEAKER_10]: But since I started using, I'm using the Hoofmaker stuff, and it actually made the eczema on my knuckles go away.

1676
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:27,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny enough, my hands are fine.

1677
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:29,011
[SPEAKER_04]: My hands, never a problem.

1678
02:10:29,031 --> 02:10:30,451
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I get a lot of compliments on my hands.

1679
02:10:30,471 --> 02:10:31,391
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've started using it on my knees.

1680
02:10:32,312 --> 02:10:33,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And it, I'm just saying, it helps.

1681
02:10:33,812 --> 02:10:34,152
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1682
02:10:34,812 --> 02:10:36,373
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, anyhow, let's move on.

1683
02:10:38,257 --> 02:10:41,838
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple quick stories for you guys in the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1684
02:10:42,618 --> 02:10:42,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1685
02:10:42,878 --> 02:10:43,818
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's funny.

1686
02:10:43,838 --> 02:10:49,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just watching video for some of the Saints Row 3rd stuff just because it's fun watching the video over and over and over again.

1687
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:59,001
[SPEAKER_05]: They announced their Hyper Ordinary Pre-Order Pack, and this will be included with games that you pre-order, I'm assuming, anywhere.

1688
02:10:59,081 --> 02:11:01,782
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it...

1689
02:11:03,302 --> 02:11:04,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe just certain outlets.

1690
02:11:04,583 --> 02:11:08,025
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's Professor Genki's Hyper Ordinary Pre-Order Pack.

1691
02:11:08,525 --> 02:11:09,885
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets you a few things.

1692
02:11:09,925 --> 02:11:17,769
[SPEAKER_05]: The Professor Genki suit, which Professor Genki, if you don't know about the game, it's this weird...

1693
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:19,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

1694
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:20,490
[SPEAKER_05]: A catapult.

1695
02:11:43,681 --> 02:11:44,722
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a manapult.

1696
02:11:45,823 --> 02:11:50,368
[SPEAKER_05]: You can suck pedestrians up into the cannon and fire them out.

1697
02:11:51,690 --> 02:11:59,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, there's a weapon that's an octopus gun that fires octopuses that land on people's heads.

1698
02:12:02,381 --> 02:12:16,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that's not crazy enough for you, they have the platinum pack that's available, which I'm seriously considering buying this, that comes with a headset that auto-tunes your voice automatically.

1699
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:19,291
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of worth it in the price of there.

1700
02:12:19,531 --> 02:12:23,032
[SPEAKER_05]: And as well as the soundtrack, and I'm sure some other fun bonuses in there as well.

1701
02:12:23,613 --> 02:12:27,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the headset does not work with Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network.

1702
02:12:28,375 --> 02:12:31,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it does, but you have to buy a little adapter.

1703
02:12:31,976 --> 02:12:32,616
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

1704
02:12:32,717 --> 02:12:35,458
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still worth it to have a headset that auto-tunes your voice.

1705
02:12:35,538 --> 02:12:37,339
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be worth it just for this show.

1706
02:12:37,419 --> 02:12:39,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I could do a whole show auto-tuned.

1707
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:48,283
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's funny that the subject of Auto-Tune came up on last night's Under Sedation Live, and you've got to check out this app on the iPhone.

1708
02:12:48,343 --> 02:12:55,426
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Songify, and it's an app where you can make instant songs out of whatever.

1709
02:12:55,586 --> 02:12:58,847
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I don't want to rip off the bit from USL, but I feel like now I have to demo it.

1710
02:12:59,167 --> 02:12:59,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, do it.

1711
02:12:59,948 --> 02:13:00,188
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

1712
02:13:00,448 --> 02:13:02,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's Songify, and what should I sing about?

1713
02:13:02,849 --> 02:13:03,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me what to sing about.

1714
02:13:04,369 --> 02:13:06,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Sing about hemorrhoids.

1715
02:13:07,331 --> 02:13:08,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1716
02:13:08,592 --> 02:13:09,893
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not going to sing about hemorrhoids.

1717
02:13:09,913 --> 02:13:10,613
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gross.

1718
02:13:11,154 --> 02:13:12,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Sing about... I'll sing a song about Loki.

1719
02:13:12,775 --> 02:13:13,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Sing about Lady Gaga.

1720
02:13:14,016 --> 02:13:14,856
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'll sing a song about Loki.

1721
02:13:14,876 --> 02:13:15,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1722
02:13:15,457 --> 02:13:15,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1723
02:13:18,359 --> 02:13:28,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki went to Round Table Pizza and got a pizza with cheese and pepperoni but no bacon.

1724
02:13:28,626 --> 02:13:30,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so now it's going to do its thing.

1725
02:13:30,927 --> 02:13:31,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.

1726
02:13:33,358 --> 02:13:34,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hold on.

1727
02:13:35,319 --> 02:13:35,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it wrong.

1728
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:37,041
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't recording that whole time.

1729
02:13:37,081 --> 02:13:37,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1730
02:13:38,422 --> 02:13:39,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Live radio.

1731
02:13:39,163 --> 02:13:39,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, live radio.

1732
02:13:39,904 --> 02:13:40,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1733
02:13:40,264 --> 02:13:40,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1734
02:13:40,504 --> 02:13:40,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1735
02:13:41,425 --> 02:13:41,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1736
02:13:43,467 --> 02:13:46,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki went to Roundtable Pizza.

1737
02:13:47,390 --> 02:13:51,053
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't get the bacon pizza because bacon makes you fat.

1738
02:13:51,073 --> 02:13:53,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

1739
02:13:56,894 --> 02:14:14,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki went to Roundtable Pizza He didn't get the bacon pizza Because bacon makes you fat Pizza He didn't get the bacon pizza Because bacon makes you fat

1740
02:14:18,137 --> 02:14:32,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, went to Roundtable, Loki, went to Roundtable Pizza So obviously it's not perfect because, you know, it kind of cuts out a little bit there, but this duo is awesome.

1741
02:14:33,016 --> 02:14:33,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Songify, you said?

1742
02:14:34,058 --> 02:14:35,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Songify, it's free.

1743
02:14:35,780 --> 02:14:36,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Download it.

1744
02:14:36,701 --> 02:14:40,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the way they make money is you can download other add-ons and so forth.

1745
02:14:40,322 --> 02:14:43,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for instance, I just got one that says, sounds like you can sing.

1746
02:14:43,203 --> 02:14:44,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you tried La Di Da?

1747
02:14:44,564 --> 02:14:46,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Rumor is Kesha uses it to sing better.

1748
02:14:47,385 --> 02:14:48,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Cute little things like that.

1749
02:14:48,625 --> 02:14:49,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I have to tell you.

1750
02:14:49,986 --> 02:14:51,806
[SPEAKER_10]: You know how we talked about the blow video?

1751
02:14:52,546 --> 02:14:57,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I found out who the director was and he did some other videos that are freaking hilarious.

1752
02:14:57,808 --> 02:14:59,729
[SPEAKER_10]: This guy is like amazing.

1753
02:15:00,009 --> 02:15:03,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, well, that was the director.

1754
02:15:03,652 --> 02:15:05,113
[SPEAKER_10]: We found the director's other videos.

1755
02:15:05,133 --> 02:15:05,674
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1756
02:15:06,074 --> 02:15:07,275
[SPEAKER_10]: So, anyway, I had to say that.

1757
02:15:07,736 --> 02:15:08,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1758
02:15:08,116 --> 02:15:12,760
[SPEAKER_10]: It was me and Becky and Susan in here just watching the hell out of these.

1759
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:13,461
[SPEAKER_10]: It was so funny.

1760
02:15:15,342 --> 02:15:19,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, one more story for you guys here, and it has to do with sports games.

1761
02:15:19,083 --> 02:15:25,784
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of an opinion piece, but since we're a little short on news tonight, I thought I'd... By the way, I'm loving these comments in chat right now.

1762
02:15:25,984 --> 02:15:28,365
[SPEAKER_04]: People trying to vote for that song in the cage match.

1763
02:15:28,405 --> 02:15:29,725
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't vote for that song.

1764
02:15:29,805 --> 02:15:30,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it.

1765
02:15:30,185 --> 02:15:30,605
[SPEAKER_09]: What's it called?

1766
02:15:30,625 --> 02:15:31,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Songify?

1767
02:15:31,666 --> 02:15:32,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Songify.

1768
02:15:32,786 --> 02:15:35,566
[SPEAKER_04]: S-O-N-G-I-F-I-Y or something like that.

1769
02:15:36,547 --> 02:15:36,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1770
02:15:39,615 --> 02:15:41,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you should stop hating on sports games.

1771
02:15:41,656 --> 02:15:56,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an opinion piece that came from VentureBeat.com and talks about why sports games, you know, a lot of the masses tend to hate on sports games because it's roster update and it's another fucking Madden games coming out.

1772
02:15:56,121 --> 02:15:57,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Who buys those games anyway, right?

1773
02:15:57,972 --> 02:16:09,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a sports guru for Electronic Arts says as part of this story, quote, "...the point of our games is not reenacting throwing a football, but the spirit of the sport and letting gamers fulfill their sports dreams.

1774
02:16:09,516 --> 02:16:10,537
[SPEAKER_04]: These are real players.

1775
02:16:10,577 --> 02:16:12,578
[SPEAKER_04]: There are real events, and there is real angst.

1776
02:16:12,898 --> 02:16:14,638
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to reenact reality."

1777
02:16:15,499 --> 02:16:24,182
[SPEAKER_04]: The opinion piece goes on to talk about how sports games have a role in driving forward innovation for the entire video game industry, and that's why you should take them seriously.

1778
02:16:25,482 --> 02:16:33,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess goes on to talk about NBA 2K11, the game that reenacts some of basketball's finest moments because that was the one that brought back Jordan in there.

1779
02:16:36,105 --> 02:16:44,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess saying that some people were too young to experience that back in 92, but the video game helps them relive an experience that they actually missed the first time around.

1780
02:16:45,727 --> 02:16:52,009
[SPEAKER_04]: The games include tons and tons of commentary from people that actually commentate on sports in the real industry.

1781
02:16:52,589 --> 02:17:14,619
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think a lot that kind of went through this as well and it talked about that I thought made a good point is having to re-up the reality of these games every year the opinion piece from VentureBeat.com says sports games are a main source of revenue for electronic arts so a lot of the innovation in terms of graphics and realistic physics happens in that department and trickles down to other games

1782
02:17:15,559 --> 02:17:20,680
[SPEAKER_04]: EA, for example, uses the collision engines originally built for Madden in games like Battlefield 3.

1783
02:17:21,541 --> 02:17:28,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Each year, those teams build and rebuild physics and animation engines for their in-game characters, and then other games reap the rewards of those engines.

1784
02:17:29,482 --> 02:17:35,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Physics and animation in our very core games has been very driven by sports games since the inception of the technology.

1785
02:17:36,204 --> 02:18:00,063
[SPEAKER_04]: that physics and animation had to be in a sports games for many years shooters didn't need it and then it goes on to talk about artificial intelligence is a big part of that as well when you play against sports teams and then the sports franchise did start this whole once a year cycle but World of Warcraft does the same thing Calls of Duty, Modern Warfare DDR I would throw out there again and

1786
02:18:01,124 --> 02:18:01,826
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1787
02:18:09,140 --> 02:18:12,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that you have to appeal to everyone's fandoms.

1788
02:18:13,121 --> 02:18:20,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Not every guy out there is going to like to play the RPGs.

1789
02:18:21,184 --> 02:18:23,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Not every girl out there is going to like to play adventure games.

1790
02:18:24,145 --> 02:18:27,026
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got a market there.

1791
02:18:27,266 --> 02:18:30,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Sports especially, well actually really all over the world.

1792
02:18:31,667 --> 02:18:35,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Football is such a big thing in Europe.

1793
02:18:35,188 --> 02:18:37,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about real football, not the shit we call football here.

1794
02:18:38,885 --> 02:18:40,206
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an opinion, young lady.

1795
02:18:40,386 --> 02:18:43,048
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, and I'm talking about an opinion piece, so I'm giving my opinion.

1796
02:18:43,248 --> 02:18:44,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, fine.

1797
02:18:44,149 --> 02:18:44,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't judge me.

1798
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:46,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Judging a little bit.

1799
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:46,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1800
02:18:47,651 --> 02:18:48,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Counter-judge.

1801
02:18:51,274 --> 02:18:53,435
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's important, yeah.

1802
02:18:53,455 --> 02:18:54,656
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, it's a source of revenue.

1803
02:18:55,276 --> 02:19:01,541
[SPEAKER_10]: That means that for every Madden game EA puts out, we get another Sims.

1804
02:19:02,822 --> 02:19:05,624
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a necessary evil.

1805
02:19:06,184 --> 02:19:07,445
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have to like it.

1806
02:19:08,561 --> 02:19:13,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orange.com, TigerClaw says, So all the nerds are complaining about sports games.

1807
02:19:13,825 --> 02:19:17,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't they realize that some of the most beloved video games are sports games that nerds enjoy?

1808
02:19:17,868 --> 02:19:19,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Blades of Steel, Mario Kart, anyone?

1809
02:19:20,390 --> 02:19:24,213
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I posted about this to my Google+, and I got some really interesting comments.

1810
02:19:24,413 --> 02:19:28,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And because I didn't say that I would read them on air, I don't want to read them verbatim on air.

1811
02:19:29,557 --> 02:19:31,058
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will just kind of summarize.

1812
02:19:31,218 --> 02:19:32,940
[SPEAKER_04]: One comment that I thought was very interesting was about

1813
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:58,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody who said, you know, I really enjoy the sports games, especially the football games And why I like them is that I can't really play sports games Or I can't play football IRL I can't play professional football because I'm a tall skinny dude I'm not built for professional football These games let me live out that experience And that kind of ties into what the beginning of that article said How, you know, it's about letting folks kind of

1814
02:19:59,953 --> 02:20:02,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Reenact an experience, I guess you could say.

1815
02:20:02,194 --> 02:20:04,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could see the same thing with basketball.

1816
02:20:04,334 --> 02:20:08,255
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you have to be a very certain body type to be able to really play competitive basketball.

1817
02:20:08,415 --> 02:20:11,996
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same reason why people do fantasy football and whatever.

1818
02:20:12,336 --> 02:20:12,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Loki?

1819
02:20:13,276 --> 02:20:17,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think, though, they're dodging the actual problem with sports games.

1820
02:20:17,557 --> 02:20:19,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not even just going to limit it to sports games.

1821
02:20:19,798 --> 02:20:25,319
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be a lot of games that feel that they need to release a new title in the franchise every year.

1822
02:20:25,679 --> 02:20:29,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the fact that they don't change very much year to year.

1823
02:20:29,660 --> 02:20:36,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So that still didn't address the fact that when people call it just a roster update, they tweak a few things to make things more realistic.

1824
02:20:36,863 --> 02:20:37,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for you.

1825
02:20:37,783 --> 02:20:39,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does that justify another $60?

1826
02:20:39,944 --> 02:20:45,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't really think that you went back to the ground level and rebuilt the whole game from scratch.

1827
02:20:45,626 --> 02:20:49,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that you're just tweaking it a little bit to make it a little bit better.

1828
02:20:49,887 --> 02:20:50,447
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

1829
02:20:50,507 --> 02:20:54,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Tweaks like that can be done to older games and then patched in.

1830
02:20:55,169 --> 02:20:58,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why you need to release a game every year.

1831
02:20:58,869 --> 02:21:05,215
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the idea of just throwing it out there that sports games set the bar so to speak that other games end up using?

1832
02:21:06,696 --> 02:21:09,398
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole physics and engine being used in Call of Duty.

1833
02:21:09,438 --> 02:21:09,898
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't, though.

1834
02:21:11,379 --> 02:21:12,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that they do.

1835
02:21:13,041 --> 02:21:16,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've seen... Well, the guy from Electronic Arts said.

1836
02:21:17,003 --> 02:21:18,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1837
02:21:18,104 --> 02:21:19,225
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not biased at all.

1838
02:21:20,005 --> 02:21:31,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Electronic Arts, a company that makes a ton of its money off of sports games, and they have some of the largest sports franchises out there, would totally not be skewed towards sports games at all.

1839
02:21:31,954 --> 02:21:33,114
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to say, well, you're right.

1840
02:21:33,175 --> 02:21:34,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Our games aren't very realistic at all.

1841
02:21:36,218 --> 02:21:40,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Every bit of game research, no matter the type of game, can benefit.

1842
02:21:42,291 --> 02:21:44,917
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, if you want a realistic...

1843
02:21:46,570 --> 02:21:47,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Physics, for example.

1844
02:21:48,071 --> 02:21:51,894
[SPEAKER_10]: A sports game actually is a really good judge of doing realistic physics.

1845
02:21:51,994 --> 02:21:58,378
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, you want to know how fully inflated basketball is going to bounce on a certain type of floor with a certain type of push.

1846
02:21:59,318 --> 02:22:00,659
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to program all that in.

1847
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:05,442
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, say that you take that into, like, for example, Sims.

1848
02:22:06,103 --> 02:22:09,205
[SPEAKER_10]: And they do, suddenly they have, like, you can play basketball in Sims.

1849
02:22:09,805 --> 02:22:10,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1850
02:22:10,406 --> 02:22:13,948
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, say that at the same time you take, like...

1851
02:22:16,049 --> 02:22:17,831
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1852
02:22:32,808 --> 02:22:33,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1853
02:22:48,979 --> 02:22:49,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1854
02:23:06,609 --> 02:23:09,331
[SPEAKER_05]: No one can jump like 50 feet in the air and stuff like that.

1855
02:23:09,411 --> 02:23:12,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a little bit of fantasy there.

1856
02:23:13,193 --> 02:23:21,138
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, if they really want super realistic games, then why aren't they building Madden in the Crytek engine or Unreal 3 or something like that?

1857
02:23:21,558 --> 02:23:30,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, there was Backbreaker, a game that had really realistic physics, and that sports game didn't sell very well at all.

1858
02:23:30,764 --> 02:23:31,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that...

1859
02:23:33,205 --> 02:23:39,567
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people, yeah, I understand there's a lot of people that, oh, I can't play real sports, so I'm going to play this game.

1860
02:23:39,767 --> 02:23:40,308
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

1861
02:23:40,548 --> 02:23:44,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't drive a race car, but I'll still drive a car and a game.

1862
02:23:44,309 --> 02:23:47,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't go murder people, but I'll still play a game like that.

1863
02:23:48,970 --> 02:23:54,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read some comments from chat because the chat room is lighting up on this story and I think there's some really excellent comments in the chat room here.

1864
02:23:54,954 --> 02:23:55,935
[SPEAKER_04]: From all sides of the spectrum.

1865
02:23:56,275 --> 02:23:57,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenacore says, Rob, that's bull crap.

1866
02:23:58,517 --> 02:24:02,339
[SPEAKER_04]: The updates they do to the engine are no better than patches.

1867
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:05,221
[SPEAKER_04]: You really don't get your money's worth if you keep up year to year.

1868
02:24:05,581 --> 02:24:09,424
[SPEAKER_04]: How often do your other examples charge full price for an incremental update?

1869
02:24:10,225 --> 02:24:17,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakroom in chat says, I couldn't play in the NFL because I would pee myself if I saw some guy like Ray Lewis looking at me like he's going to kill me.

1870
02:24:17,129 --> 02:24:18,010
[SPEAKER_04]: He just might kill me.

1871
02:24:18,730 --> 02:24:21,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Every NFL game I have played has been different in some way.

1872
02:24:21,651 --> 02:24:23,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes there are slight differences.

1873
02:24:23,871 --> 02:24:26,792
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says, Yeah, that's why I love Need for Speed.

1874
02:24:27,172 --> 02:24:30,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Legally, I can't really drive, but I've always grown up loving cars.

1875
02:24:30,892 --> 02:24:36,553
[SPEAKER_04]: In games like that, let me imagine what it's like driving an expensive car I'll never own really freaking fast.

1876
02:24:36,913 --> 02:24:38,494
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good analogy there.

1877
02:24:38,754 --> 02:24:42,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakroom also says, I love Dragon Quest games, and I will buy the next Dragon Quest game.

1878
02:24:43,235 --> 02:24:44,775
[SPEAKER_04]: How much have those games really changed?

1879
02:24:44,915 --> 02:24:45,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

1880
02:24:45,755 --> 02:24:46,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1881
02:24:46,095 --> 02:24:52,218
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, you do have a whole new story, new characters, new environments, new maps.

1882
02:24:53,059 --> 02:25:00,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I really follow the DQ analogy because they're completely different stories.

1883
02:25:00,563 --> 02:25:01,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

1884
02:25:01,523 --> 02:25:03,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's talk about sports games here.

1885
02:25:04,045 --> 02:25:05,066
[SPEAKER_05]: NCAA football.

1886
02:25:05,126 --> 02:25:15,953
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the big updates this year was all the pre-game rituals, like the different mascots coming across the field and the little tweaks and stuff like that.

1887
02:25:16,593 --> 02:25:21,216
[SPEAKER_05]: All stuff that you would say, yes, lends to the experience, but not necessarily the gameplay.

1888
02:25:21,657 --> 02:25:30,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that the fact that the mascot looks realistic and does whatever the mascot does normally in the game lends itself to playing a better football game.

1889
02:25:31,643 --> 02:25:32,844
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1890
02:26:01,850 --> 02:26:02,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

1891
02:26:03,411 --> 02:26:05,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd say the same thing with Modern Warfare.

1892
02:26:06,053 --> 02:26:08,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that they really need to release a new game each year.

1893
02:26:08,634 --> 02:26:11,536
[SPEAKER_05]: To their credit, though, at least there's a new storyline that goes along with it.

1894
02:26:11,616 --> 02:26:12,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a little bit of something.

1895
02:26:13,037 --> 02:26:21,881
[SPEAKER_05]: But sports games, though, you don't need to write a new story for it.

1896
02:26:21,961 --> 02:26:22,742
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sports game.

1897
02:26:22,782 --> 02:26:24,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's wrestling.

1898
02:26:25,063 --> 02:26:29,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the gaming community rejected music games doing this.

1899
02:26:30,368 --> 02:26:35,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Our opinion with DDR and such is a little bit skewed because those were games we really loved.

1900
02:26:35,773 --> 02:26:39,936
[SPEAKER_04]: But games like Guitar Hero failed because the market was too saturated with them.

1901
02:26:40,336 --> 02:26:51,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band, essentially Harmonix has said, you know what, we need to take a break from Rock Band because Rock Band 3 unfortunately didn't sell well because there were just so many Rock Band games coming out.

1902
02:26:51,366 --> 02:26:56,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think sometimes these yearly update games get rejected by the marketplace.

1903
02:26:56,587 --> 02:27:01,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I want to read a couple other comments from chat and then go to our phone lines because I'm sure folks want to call in on this.

1904
02:27:02,429 --> 02:27:03,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly, DarkSakura, before I go to chat.

1905
02:27:04,089 --> 02:27:09,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well I was actually, there is an exception to the rule when it comes to the sports games and I really think it's the wrestling games.

1906
02:27:11,011 --> 02:27:13,192
[SPEAKER_10]: So that makes sense to me.

1907
02:27:39,557 --> 02:27:42,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let me go to the chatroom at chat.orangelaunchery.com for a couple more comments.

1908
02:27:42,684 --> 02:27:47,454
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Dollar Bill in our chatroom says, I can't drive real cars, but doing it online was awesome.

1909
02:27:47,675 --> 02:27:49,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and flying sims are fantastic.

1910
02:27:50,185 --> 02:28:10,247
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I gotta say, even though I might talk about, eh, I don't play a lot of sports games I don't play a lot of Madden because I'm not super into football I don't play a lot of basketball games because I'm not super into it Although it is the sport I probably enjoy more than most others And I do love NBA Jam, the old one I'm not as big on the new one, but I'm curious about this whole arcade one they're putting out, you know

1911
02:28:10,709 --> 02:28:32,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Super high impact But one thing, one game I love are racing games I love a lot of those racing games But I usually like the arcade racers more than I like the realistic ones Like I can't do Forza, I can't do Gran Turismo But I loved Blur, I like Mario Kart I really loved F-Zero I will always love F-Zero What about Initial D?

1912
02:28:34,235 --> 02:28:36,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Sports games have been around since the first arcade game.

1913
02:28:36,777 --> 02:28:37,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Pong.

1914
02:28:37,057 --> 02:28:37,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically tennis.

1915
02:28:54,588 --> 02:28:55,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1916
02:28:55,469 --> 02:28:56,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting point.

1917
02:28:56,269 --> 02:28:56,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1918
02:28:57,851 --> 02:29:00,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see, one other comment.

1919
02:29:00,393 --> 02:29:00,994
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I want to say?

1920
02:29:01,334 --> 02:29:07,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Break Room says, I love sports games, but when I have ever tried to play in real sports, I was never any good.

1921
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:13,024
[SPEAKER_04]: A skinny white guy doesn't line up well in high school sports, but give me a controller and it's fun to pretend.

1922
02:29:14,385 --> 02:29:18,709
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt says, Listen, I've been a hockey fan for most of my life and used to play when I was younger.

1923
02:29:19,069 --> 02:29:23,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the game of hockey so much that I gladly pay for the yearly update NHL games.

1924
02:29:23,713 --> 02:29:29,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy playing the game because it's the closest I can get to playing with my favorite players and favorite teams than I can possibly ever get.

1925
02:29:30,139 --> 02:29:37,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I would gladly pay the yearly $60 cost to play the game that I truly enjoy watching, playing, and being a fan of.

1926
02:29:38,630 --> 02:29:39,170
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time.

1927
02:30:08,038 --> 02:30:14,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we're going to go to the phone here, but while we wait for the calls to come in, I will ask Loki quickly if he has any last-minute stories he wants to share with us.

1928
02:30:14,802 --> 02:30:15,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's anything that came up.

1929
02:30:16,023 --> 02:30:17,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was a very busy Newsweek.

1930
02:30:17,784 --> 02:30:18,945
[SPEAKER_05]: We might have hit on it all.

1931
02:30:19,285 --> 02:30:19,686
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't.

1932
02:30:19,726 --> 02:30:25,009
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a... There may have been one thing or two that we hadn't hit up on.

1933
02:30:26,010 --> 02:30:27,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to remember how long they were, though.

1934
02:30:28,171 --> 02:30:29,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking it up real quick here.

1935
02:30:30,733 --> 02:30:31,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1936
02:30:33,595 --> 02:30:33,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1937
02:30:38,601 --> 02:30:40,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there was something that we missed.

1938
02:30:40,343 --> 02:30:44,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1939
02:30:44,547 --> 02:30:46,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you know the story that Loki missed.

1940
02:30:46,690 --> 02:30:47,531
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, it's coming up.

1941
02:30:47,551 --> 02:30:48,111
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a story.

1942
02:30:48,672 --> 02:30:48,872
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1943
02:30:49,593 --> 02:30:51,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I do have a last minute story, but we'll wait until after this call.

1944
02:30:51,835 --> 02:30:52,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's do the call.

1945
02:30:53,597 --> 02:30:54,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1946
02:30:54,718 --> 02:30:55,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1947
02:30:55,760 --> 02:30:57,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, guys, it's Xenacore from the OKC.

1948
02:30:57,261 --> 02:30:57,862
[SPEAKER_08]: How y'all doing?

1949
02:30:57,922 --> 02:30:58,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Xenacore.

1950
02:30:58,803 --> 02:31:00,224
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going in the OKC?

1951
02:31:01,044 --> 02:31:02,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, I'm pissed off, man.

1952
02:31:02,444 --> 02:31:08,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I went off to work, I set my DVR to record the World Cup, and of course it stopped recording right before the shootout.

1953
02:31:09,406 --> 02:31:12,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I know how it ended, I didn't get to see how it ended.

1954
02:31:12,326 --> 02:31:18,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, you missed the... It's so funny about soccer games that come down to that.

1955
02:31:19,508 --> 02:31:23,629
[SPEAKER_04]: That whole five minutes is like the entire game right there.

1956
02:31:23,969 --> 02:31:24,509
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

1957
02:31:25,109 --> 02:31:28,732
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets right before they start running out on the field, and it's like, this is the end of the recording.

1958
02:31:28,772 --> 02:31:30,553
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, oh, you bastard, I'll kill you.

1959
02:31:30,773 --> 02:31:31,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to hear it.

1960
02:31:31,454 --> 02:31:32,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how is OKC these days?

1961
02:31:32,775 --> 02:31:34,797
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a city I haven't been to since I was 17.

1962
02:31:35,477 --> 02:31:36,318
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hot, man.

1963
02:31:37,499 --> 02:31:43,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like going through the whole Good Morning Vietnam rant about it being too hot in Vietnam, but I'll tell you the truth.

1964
02:31:43,603 --> 02:31:46,125
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, after you've been in 130, 100's nothing.

1965
02:31:46,425 --> 02:31:49,368
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, I guess we should bring it back to games, though.

1966
02:31:49,448 --> 02:31:51,069
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's on your mind about the gaming world today?

1967
02:31:52,224 --> 02:31:56,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been sort of preparing for Dark Souls the best way I can.

1968
02:31:56,165 --> 02:31:58,766
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I put Demon's Souls back in my machine.

1969
02:31:59,146 --> 02:32:00,766
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a game I need to go back and play more of.

1970
02:32:00,826 --> 02:32:02,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Demon's Souls is so unkind, though.

1971
02:32:03,367 --> 02:32:04,747
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is just not nice.

1972
02:32:05,388 --> 02:32:07,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this time I'm backing myself up with the wiki.

1973
02:32:09,109 --> 02:32:12,930
[SPEAKER_08]: The Demon's Souls wiki, they put so much information in that thing, it's ridiculous.

1974
02:32:13,410 --> 02:32:14,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Now there's a plan.

1975
02:32:15,010 --> 02:32:16,312
[SPEAKER_08]: So now all I have to do is survive it.

1976
02:32:16,672 --> 02:32:21,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you want to play a game like Demon's Souls?

1977
02:32:21,317 --> 02:32:22,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that game is too fucking hard.

1978
02:32:22,678 --> 02:32:23,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a masochist, sir?

1979
02:32:24,380 --> 02:32:27,924
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because you have to struggle to truly achieve anything.

1980
02:32:28,224 --> 02:32:31,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And most of the games nowadays just hand you the ending on a silver platter.

1981
02:32:32,629 --> 02:32:33,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

1982
02:32:33,730 --> 02:32:36,531
[SPEAKER_08]: All you have to do is, oh, I played it for 50 hours.

1983
02:32:36,591 --> 02:32:37,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm almost near the end now.

1984
02:32:37,832 --> 02:32:39,032
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no challenge in it.

1985
02:32:39,512 --> 02:32:41,954
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to get better at the game to see the ending.

1986
02:32:42,114 --> 02:32:44,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Sir, I think that might have been a dig at Final Fantasy.

1987
02:32:44,075 --> 02:32:44,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not quite sure.

1988
02:32:45,555 --> 02:32:47,516
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is gaming in general, man.

1989
02:32:47,536 --> 02:32:49,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm covering the whole scope.

1990
02:32:49,777 --> 02:32:50,318
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1991
02:32:50,438 --> 02:32:50,898
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1992
02:32:51,619 --> 02:32:55,362
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you hope they improve on in the next incarnation of the Souls series?

1993
02:32:55,382 --> 02:32:55,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1994
02:33:20,344 --> 02:33:31,373
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing they could really improve on is maybe if they could get the whole environment into one gigantic streaming level, like just a big-ass castle.

1995
02:33:32,274 --> 02:33:37,858
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way, although you can teleport to different areas of the castle, you can actually walk the whole thing from one thing to the other.

1996
02:33:37,878 --> 02:33:39,039
[SPEAKER_08]: That would actually be kind of cool.

1997
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:41,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1998
02:33:41,641 --> 02:33:47,186
[SPEAKER_04]: You calling and asking about that game makes me really want to go back and play it, because I'll tell you, I didn't get very far, even though I spent hours...

1999
02:33:49,884 --> 02:33:51,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you got to talk to Pandit.

2000
02:33:51,504 --> 02:33:56,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of everybody in the all-games community, I can think of, she's probably the one person I know of that's actually finished it.

2001
02:33:56,966 --> 02:33:58,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, finished?

2002
02:33:58,986 --> 02:34:03,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she's got a character that's like level 120 or something, so you know you have to put some time in to get a character that high.

2003
02:34:04,008 --> 02:34:06,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's dedication.

2004
02:34:06,848 --> 02:34:08,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anything else on your mind this week?

2005
02:34:10,361 --> 02:34:15,464
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just that and the whole thing about the incremental updating for the sports games.

2006
02:34:15,504 --> 02:34:19,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if it was on a PC, you'd just get patches now and again for all that information.

2007
02:34:20,786 --> 02:34:25,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, the fans who want to pay it just so they can have the updated team rosters, that's fine.

2008
02:34:25,249 --> 02:34:27,590
[SPEAKER_08]: But they'd just be just as happy if they got it in a patch.

2009
02:34:27,950 --> 02:34:29,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't a lot of that crap also DLC?

2010
02:34:31,345 --> 02:34:59,353
[SPEAKER_08]: it could be DLC too like for instance yeah an updated Rouser cost you three bucks or whatever they wouldn't have to release a whole new game it would be nothing but profit they wouldn't have to reprint or anything else like that you know now that the DLC has been pushed out there I could see them easily doing that but I don't think they want to like most of the executives will do don't mess with the money you know so keep it coming the way they're used to paying for it and maybe we can keep that money coming in the way we want it alright so I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls but thanks for your call

2011
02:34:59,963 --> 02:35:00,563
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem, guys.

2012
02:35:00,584 --> 02:35:01,164
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take it easy.

2013
02:35:22,310 --> 02:35:24,313
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Zeether from the chat.

2014
02:35:24,513 --> 02:35:25,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Zeether!

2015
02:35:26,276 --> 02:35:28,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I recognize your name, but I think you're also a first-time caller, right?

2016
02:35:28,819 --> 02:35:29,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm a first-time caller.

2017
02:35:30,261 --> 02:35:31,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Long-time listener, first-time caller?

2018
02:35:32,905 --> 02:35:33,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2019
02:35:33,606 --> 02:35:33,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2020
02:35:34,147 --> 02:35:34,868
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, Zeether?

2021
02:35:35,498 --> 02:35:40,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I was just, you guys were talking about Wonga on Maximum Tune.

2022
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:40,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2023
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:52,505
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was really, I was really hyped for that because I've been following it ever since it was announced and they had the trailer put out and the music already sounds really good.

2024
02:35:52,925 --> 02:35:59,708
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the trailer just has like a little mix of the various songs, but it sounds fantastic.

2025
02:35:59,768 --> 02:36:02,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I really hope they release like a soundtrack CD for it.

2026
02:36:02,449 --> 02:36:03,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like they did the other games.

2027
02:36:03,630 --> 02:36:04,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those soundtracks are awesome.

2028
02:36:04,972 --> 02:36:07,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever actually driven to those soundtracks?

2029
02:36:08,775 --> 02:36:09,616
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, actually I did.

2030
02:36:09,636 --> 02:36:12,379
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to drive from high school and back while listening to it.

2031
02:36:12,679 --> 02:36:13,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And how fast did you go?

2032
02:36:15,742 --> 02:36:17,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't make me drive faster though.

2033
02:36:17,264 --> 02:36:17,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

2034
02:36:18,265 --> 02:36:21,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'll tell you, some of that music makes me just want to drive faster.

2035
02:36:21,949 --> 02:36:23,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say nothing about the LA trips.

2036
02:36:23,750 --> 02:36:23,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2037
02:36:26,949 --> 02:36:33,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and, oh yeah, have any of you guys played the PS2 game, the Wangan PS2 game?

2038
02:36:34,136 --> 02:36:36,798
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like Tokyo Extreme Racer, kind of.

2039
02:36:37,399 --> 02:36:38,039
[SPEAKER_13]: I have not.

2040
02:36:38,079 --> 02:36:44,926
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one on PlayStation 3 that Loki imported, but it was not like the arcade games at all.

2041
02:36:44,966 --> 02:36:46,347
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of bad, actually.

2042
02:36:46,407 --> 02:36:47,128
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the one?

2043
02:36:47,488 --> 02:36:48,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Wangan Midnight.

2044
02:36:48,829 --> 02:37:07,237
[SPEAKER_13]: just Wangan Midnight was the one there actually was one on the PS2 and it was released in the arcades as Wangan Midnight R and it was basically like a Tokyo Extreme Racer type game and the music in it was different from like the standard trance music it was more orchestral

2045
02:37:08,902 --> 02:37:09,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Yuzo Koshiro

2046
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:34,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

2047
02:37:52,661 --> 02:37:57,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time I played Streets of Rage was on the Sonic's Mega Genesis Collection or whatever for the Xbox 360.

2048
02:37:58,865 --> 02:38:00,126
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have the PS3 one actually.

2049
02:38:00,386 --> 02:38:02,288
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got like Streets of Rage 1, 2, and 3.

2050
02:38:02,748 --> 02:38:03,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a great deal.

2051
02:38:04,869 --> 02:38:06,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Along with a shit ton of other Genesis games.

2052
02:38:06,931 --> 02:38:07,351
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

2053
02:38:08,552 --> 02:38:08,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2054
02:38:09,392 --> 02:38:09,653
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2055
02:38:09,673 --> 02:38:12,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, any other games we should be looking out for this week?

2056
02:38:13,535 --> 02:38:14,376
[SPEAKER_13]: No, nothing else.

2057
02:38:14,536 --> 02:38:18,419
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just calling about Wongun because I'm a pretty big fan of that.

2058
02:38:18,499 --> 02:38:19,739
[SPEAKER_13]: And Initial D. Initial D.

2059
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:21,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Love it.

2060
02:38:21,881 --> 02:38:27,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, those are the games that are kind of keeping some arcades afloat right now with actual arcades as opposed to kiddie gambling.

2061
02:38:28,246 --> 02:38:34,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you go to the local Golf Land here, those are really the only games that made me stop and go, ooh, I kind of want to actually spend money on this game.

2062
02:38:34,590 --> 02:38:38,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's so much crap now, you know, that spit out tickets and so forth.

2063
02:38:39,571 --> 02:38:51,754
[SPEAKER_13]: The sad thing is the newer initial D games, like versions 5 and 6, they have not gotten proper English versions because Sega probably just gave up on localizing them.

2064
02:38:51,774 --> 02:38:52,595
[SPEAKER_13]: That's sad.

2065
02:38:53,755 --> 02:39:01,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the good news is the PlayStation 3 is region-free, so hopefully this new game that they're releasing in the arcades, maybe we'll get a decent home version of it.

2066
02:39:02,477 --> 02:39:04,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's only in Japan, at least we can import it over here.

2067
02:39:05,393 --> 02:39:08,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I've been considering getting a PS3 because of the initial D game.

2068
02:39:08,795 --> 02:39:11,196
[SPEAKER_13]: I've watched all of the anime, pretty much.

2069
02:39:11,456 --> 02:39:12,337
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fantastic.

2070
02:39:12,357 --> 02:39:15,498
[SPEAKER_04]: You are really into these games, then, if you've gone so far as to watch the anime.

2071
02:39:15,518 --> 02:39:16,099
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

2072
02:39:16,839 --> 02:39:17,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2073
02:39:17,580 --> 02:39:20,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much for your call, alright?

2074
02:39:21,182 --> 02:39:21,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

2075
02:39:23,997 --> 02:39:30,401
[SPEAKER_04]: and here's a hint, don't go driving down a barren freeway to the soundtracks of one of those games because you might not realize how fast you were going.

2076
02:39:30,821 --> 02:39:33,702
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, let me have you work on your story real quick here before I go back to the phone.

2077
02:39:33,943 --> 02:39:41,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the story is actually that the creator of VVVVVV made a Super Meat Boy tribute, sort of.

2078
02:39:41,727 --> 02:39:46,370
[SPEAKER_10]: He did a Super Meat Boy flash game that's in the style of his own game, VVVVVV.

2079
02:39:47,430 --> 02:40:05,396
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's actually available at distractionware.com slash games slash flash slash meat boy And he says it's only a couple of screens long and very broken I can't wait for the next team meat game, just saying Let's go to the phones and take another call Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2080
02:40:06,536 --> 02:40:09,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Spazinator Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind buddy?

2081
02:40:12,123 --> 02:40:13,344
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple things, actually.

2082
02:40:14,745 --> 02:40:21,590
[SPEAKER_01]: To touch on what we were talking about a few minutes ago with the whole EA constantly releasing new games.

2083
02:40:23,532 --> 02:40:32,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in fact, you had mentioned, I believe, why don't they just release yearly patches instead of releasing new games.

2084
02:40:34,059 --> 02:40:39,203
[SPEAKER_01]: To use an analogy, I'll ask a rhetorical question.

2085
02:40:39,696 --> 02:40:47,403
[SPEAKER_01]: How much did DarkSakura pay for the 4.2 patch in World of Warcraft?

2086
02:40:48,443 --> 02:40:49,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing, right?

2087
02:40:49,424 --> 02:40:49,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, nothing.

2088
02:40:51,246 --> 02:41:01,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that kind of illustrates the point that you can't really charge for patches.

2089
02:41:02,355 --> 02:41:03,336
[SPEAKER_01]: They can update the...

2090
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:33,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Madden 20 billion times you know with patches but you can't really make $60 off patches let me play devil's advocate here for a minute though you could say that she got the patches free but you could also say she's paying $14.95 a month to get the patch because you know MMOs are kind of their own little beast because you do pay a subscription fee for most of them now granted some are free to play but they just make their money in other ways

2091
02:41:34,724 --> 02:41:35,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, true.

2092
02:41:36,025 --> 02:41:40,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps I really picked a really poor example for my analogy.

2093
02:41:40,148 --> 02:41:40,708
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.

2094
02:41:41,889 --> 02:41:55,318
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if you had, let's say, Uncharted 1, the patch analogy would apply because there's no monthly charts for Uncharted.

2095
02:41:55,518 --> 02:41:56,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

2096
02:41:56,419 --> 02:41:57,319
[SPEAKER_01]: But now...

2097
02:41:59,281 --> 02:42:11,907
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were to release, you know, the yearly increments in Madden on desk, you know, with the, you know, then, yeah, they can make their 60 bucks every single time, you know.

2098
02:42:11,967 --> 02:42:25,654
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like, I don't know, why kill the goose that's laying the golden eggs, or at least gimp it anyway, when they can keep it nothing healthy and kill all the golden eggs, you know.

2099
02:42:26,280 --> 02:42:28,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's kind of like making sequels to movies.

2100
02:42:29,063 --> 02:42:32,967
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't release those for free, so I don't know.

2101
02:42:33,807 --> 02:42:39,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, one final note before I do let you go.

2102
02:42:39,693 --> 02:42:40,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

2103
02:42:41,655 --> 02:42:46,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick update as to what's going on with my PlayStation 3 thing.

2104
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:48,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I know everyone's kind of asking about it, so...

2105
02:42:51,098 --> 02:43:08,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right now, Game Repair is temporarily on hold, if only because of bureaucratic red tape with my Social Security Disability Payee's offices.

2106
02:43:09,790 --> 02:43:11,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I have put in a request.

2107
02:43:12,011 --> 02:43:14,712
[SPEAKER_01]: for the extra funds for like two weeks ago.

2108
02:43:14,892 --> 02:43:17,874
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a money issue right now.

2109
02:43:17,914 --> 02:43:21,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Just real life economical money stuff.

2110
02:43:22,096 --> 02:43:22,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2111
02:43:23,777 --> 02:43:27,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2112
02:43:27,598 --> 02:43:33,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently I need to have her do some paperwork and I have to find data.

2113
02:43:33,081 --> 02:43:35,142
[SPEAKER_01]: They got taken care of.

2114
02:43:37,156 --> 02:43:40,258
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be fair, these are all things that have nothing to do with Sony.

2115
02:43:40,318 --> 02:43:52,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but to make a long story short, hopefully I'll have the money to have it repaired this week.

2116
02:43:53,596 --> 02:43:56,619
[SPEAKER_01]: and once I get the money, I'll get the ball rolling and get everything repaired.

2117
02:43:57,159 --> 02:44:00,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well you'll have to let us know how that repair process goes once you get that taken care of.

2118
02:44:00,762 --> 02:44:04,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well Spassinator, we're going to let you go to get some more calls but thank you for your thoughts.

2119
02:44:04,265 --> 02:44:07,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one and good luck with the PlayStation drama.

2120
02:44:07,327 --> 02:44:09,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2121
02:44:09,068 --> 02:44:13,472
[SPEAKER_04]: 1877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call and we'll talk.

2122
02:44:14,533 --> 02:44:17,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, does anyone else have other stories they want to talk about tonight?

2123
02:44:17,939 --> 02:44:25,966
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want to say that I've put some more stuff up on our Tumblr, including Gon's ending in Tekken 3 and some of the playthrough of Tekken Force Mode.

2124
02:44:26,186 --> 02:44:31,131
[SPEAKER_04]: You should also do me a favor and put up the recorder video that we had talked about earlier in the show.

2125
02:44:31,211 --> 02:44:32,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I will do such a thing.

2126
02:44:32,432 --> 02:44:32,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2127
02:44:32,772 --> 02:44:33,993
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be nice.

2128
02:44:34,533 --> 02:44:37,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, I guess we have time for one more call, so let's go back to the... Whoa!

2129
02:44:37,956 --> 02:44:38,737
[SPEAKER_04]: There is feedback.

2130
02:44:38,917 --> 02:44:39,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, caller, can you hear me?

2131
02:44:41,465 --> 02:44:42,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, gotta let you go, buddy.

2132
02:44:42,725 --> 02:44:43,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I am sorry.

2133
02:44:43,285 --> 02:44:44,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you check your connection?

2134
02:44:44,426 --> 02:44:46,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Echo 123, remember, is a good thing to call?

2135
02:44:47,166 --> 02:44:48,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I apologize to the listeners.

2136
02:44:48,887 --> 02:44:49,747
[SPEAKER_04]: That was driving me bonkers.

2137
02:44:50,287 --> 02:44:51,467
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit out of my control, though.

2138
02:44:51,487 --> 02:44:53,228
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's try another call.

2139
02:44:53,268 --> 02:44:54,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2140
02:44:54,148 --> 02:44:54,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2141
02:44:55,768 --> 02:44:56,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up, guys?

2142
02:44:56,348 --> 02:44:57,009
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Kai Judo.

2143
02:44:57,149 --> 02:44:57,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Kai Judo.

2144
02:44:57,729 --> 02:44:58,369
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2145
02:44:59,729 --> 02:45:07,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to make two points as far as the sports games just being an update roster type of thing.

2146
02:45:07,191 --> 02:45:07,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

2147
02:45:08,619 --> 02:45:10,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not the biggest sports game player.

2148
02:45:10,039 --> 02:45:15,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, every once in a while I'll pick up the NBA 2K series just because I like that series.

2149
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:24,202
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I do notice when I do pick it up, maybe it's just because I wait a couple of years before I pick it up, they do add a lot more to the game, especially on the multiplayer side.

2150
02:45:24,702 --> 02:45:34,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Like right now in the NBA games, you can actually play like you and four other people can actually play five other people in line.

2151
02:45:34,804 --> 02:45:37,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you'll be like one entire basketball team.

2152
02:45:37,779 --> 02:45:40,402
[SPEAKER_06]: and you could go up against another team of five, which I think is great.

2153
02:45:40,422 --> 02:45:45,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish they would put that in a baseball game, actually have nine versus nine in a baseball game.

2154
02:45:46,709 --> 02:45:47,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they haven't done that yet.

2155
02:45:47,990 --> 02:45:48,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure they can do it.

2156
02:45:49,435 --> 02:46:14,384
[SPEAKER_04]: but um you know they they they're pretty innovative is basically what I'm saying is that they they do add stuff other than just updating the roster you know what's interesting though is I do notice a common theme between what you're saying between what Matt's saying and between what I think I'm going to say for us and our support of DDR over the years even when a lot of people didn't get it and that is you know in chat SJ100 Matt said you know I pay 60 bucks a year gladly because I love hockey and this is

2157
02:46:14,844 --> 02:46:16,444
[SPEAKER_04]: How I Get Close to Hockey.

2158
02:46:16,924 --> 02:46:20,105
[SPEAKER_04]: And for you, it just sounds like it's replaced basketball with hockey.

2159
02:46:20,545 --> 02:46:25,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And for you, even though the rest of us might look at it and go, they don't even update anything in those games.

2160
02:46:25,506 --> 02:46:29,687
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at it and go, oh my God, there's all these awesome new features that make it more realistic.

2161
02:46:30,327 --> 02:46:31,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I kind of right here?

2162
02:46:31,327 --> 02:46:35,088
[SPEAKER_04]: That maybe not everyone gets it because not everyone is necessarily a huge fan.

2163
02:46:35,408 --> 02:46:42,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas we look at DDR and we go, oh, but they've introduced, now you can do Marvelous as opposed to Perfects as well and it's a new thing.

2164
02:46:42,410 --> 02:46:43,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And not everybody gets that.

2165
02:46:44,778 --> 02:46:45,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

2166
02:46:45,578 --> 02:46:46,419
[SPEAKER_06]: It just has to be your thing.

2167
02:46:46,439 --> 02:46:53,322
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to be into it to really notice some of the subtle differences and the major differences that they do make in a game.

2168
02:46:53,342 --> 02:46:55,363
[SPEAKER_06]: So they do improve the game a lot.

2169
02:46:55,723 --> 02:46:59,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, the updated roster thing is kind of like a crazy argument.

2170
02:46:59,745 --> 02:47:03,506
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing I wanted to point out was sports games do actually have a story.

2171
02:47:03,806 --> 02:47:10,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you have to create the story on your own, just basically using your own imagination, kind of like an old D&D tabletop type of a game.

2172
02:47:11,590 --> 02:47:12,810
[SPEAKER_06]: But there is story.

2173
02:47:12,830 --> 02:47:14,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, especially I can remember...

2174
02:47:15,098 --> 02:47:19,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing Madden back in the early 90s when I was in my teens.

2175
02:47:19,420 --> 02:47:21,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and my friends had stories.

2176
02:47:21,820 --> 02:47:22,761
[SPEAKER_06]: We had rivalries going.

2177
02:47:22,801 --> 02:47:25,141
[SPEAKER_06]: We had tournaments going.

2178
02:47:25,241 --> 02:47:32,824
[SPEAKER_06]: We were playing with a lot of emotion behind those games because so-and-so beat my ass last week, so now I've got to come back and beat their ass.

2179
02:47:33,524 --> 02:47:35,405
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, it's just a lot of fun to play.

2180
02:47:35,665 --> 02:47:36,705
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to fucking lose.

2181
02:47:36,725 --> 02:47:39,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly, yeah.

2182
02:47:39,686 --> 02:47:39,966
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2183
02:47:39,986 --> 02:47:41,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, those are my two points.

2184
02:47:41,727 --> 02:47:42,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2185
02:47:42,087 --> 02:47:42,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good.

2186
02:47:42,567 --> 02:47:43,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those are fair points.

2187
02:47:43,408 --> 02:47:44,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm weighing on my prize.

2188
02:47:45,308 --> 02:47:46,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you know what happened?

2189
02:47:46,509 --> 02:47:47,849
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a little slowed down.

2190
02:47:47,949 --> 02:47:55,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it sitting here and Loki has to sign it because we got folks, he ran out last week before I had a chance to have him sign it, but we're hoping to get that out to you Monday or Tuesday.

2191
02:47:55,752 --> 02:47:57,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So, look out for it.

2192
02:47:57,172 --> 02:47:57,413
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

2193
02:47:57,433 --> 02:47:57,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Take your time.

2194
02:47:58,033 --> 02:47:58,693
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2195
02:47:58,953 --> 02:47:59,493
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

2196
02:47:59,513 --> 02:48:00,114
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, good night.

2197
02:48:00,134 --> 02:48:00,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2198
02:48:01,694 --> 02:48:02,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye

2199
02:48:31,385 --> 02:48:32,371
[SPEAKER_04]: and see what we end up with.

2200
02:48:32,531 --> 02:48:33,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I hear it again.

2201
02:48:33,758 --> 02:48:34,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Caller, are you there?

2202
02:48:38,846 --> 02:48:39,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I can't.

2203
02:48:40,066 --> 02:48:40,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.

2204
02:48:40,466 --> 02:48:41,987
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like the emergency broadcast system.

2205
02:48:42,367 --> 02:48:42,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry.

2206
02:48:43,347 --> 02:48:44,368
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just, I can't.

2207
02:48:44,968 --> 02:48:45,308
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2208
02:48:46,228 --> 02:48:47,588
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2209
02:48:47,728 --> 02:48:56,431
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send in your thoughts, send us an email at mailbag at orangelaundry.com or you can, of course, always leave us a voicemail or what have you.

2210
02:48:56,451 --> 02:48:57,911
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to get to those throughout the week as well.

2211
02:48:58,291 --> 02:49:01,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Or send us a tweet, twitter.com slash OLR.

2212
02:49:01,972 --> 02:49:02,232
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2213
02:49:02,312 --> 02:49:05,873
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap things up tonight.

2214
02:49:05,933 --> 02:49:08,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, what's your final thought?

2215
02:49:08,547 --> 02:49:11,533
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is... I'm tired.

2216
02:49:14,658 --> 02:49:16,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2217
02:49:17,664 --> 02:49:18,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Gon is pretty funny.

2218
02:49:19,910 --> 02:49:24,792
[SPEAKER_04]: and my final thought tonight is even though I had a quesadilla today, now I want a taco.

2219
02:49:24,912 --> 02:49:26,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the complete Mexican food day.

2220
02:49:26,753 --> 02:49:27,313
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want.

2221
02:49:28,353 --> 02:49:28,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Jimmy Chunga.

2222
02:49:30,214 --> 02:49:32,435
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's going to do it for another week here of Orange Launch Radio.

2223
02:49:32,695 --> 02:49:40,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and staying up late with us if you're listening live or letting us be a part of your work day or evening or whatever it is you do when you listen to the show on the podcast feed.

2224
02:49:41,118 --> 02:49:44,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you just for spending the time with us and getting through all two and a half, three hours of our show.

2225
02:49:45,299 --> 02:49:46,020
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2226
02:50:00,296 --> 02:50:02,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2227
02:50:02,617 --> 02:50:06,038
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we've done it over the years and have built our family up.

2228
02:50:06,118 --> 02:50:08,759
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably how you found out about OLR was by somebody else.

2229
02:50:09,079 --> 02:50:10,359
[SPEAKER_04]: So please help us spread the word.

2230
02:50:10,879 --> 02:50:13,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, we'll be back to do it all again next week.

2231
02:50:13,420 --> 02:50:17,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Another episode of Orange Lounge Radio with the latest in gaming news and most importantly, your thoughts.

2232
02:50:18,202 --> 02:50:19,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

2233
02:50:20,202 --> 02:50:20,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night, everybody.

2234
02:50:20,923 --> 02:50:21,483
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time.

2235
