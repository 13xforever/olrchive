0	19200	Tonight, July 31st, 2011, Nintendo slashes the price of the 3DS.
19200	24200	The average price of an Xbox Live Arcade title is going up, and could the PlayStation 3 soon
24200	32000	feature a doll?
32000	34920	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34920	38840	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38840	42680	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,
42680	46000	first off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
46000	47000	Hi.
47000	48000	How are you, Miss Summers?
48000	49000	Um, okay.
49000	51000	I feel a little disconnected.
51000	53240	Exterminate, why is that?
53240	54760	Just a little.
54760	57920	Because you've been playing WoW all week, and you feel disconnected from society?
57920	58920	No.
58920	60800	When was the last time you had a Pinkberry?
60800	62960	Actually, it's been about a week and a half.
62960	64600	That's why you feel disconnected.
64600	68080	Well, then maybe we should end the show early and go get Pinkberry.
68080	69520	I'm down with that.
69520	70520	Last week's show was a fair-a-thon.
70520	71520	And that's the show.
71520	72520	There you go.
72520	73520	Goodnight everybody!
73520	74520	Bye!
74520	75520	Blah, blah, blah, Nintendo, blah, blah, blah.
75520	76520	Ubisoft, goodnight.
76520	77520	No, just kidding.
77520	79600	All right, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
79600	80600	Hello.
80600	82600	How are you doing, Loki?
82600	83600	I'm doing great.
83600	84680	Are you feeling connected?
84680	86320	Are you on the grid this week?
86320	88400	Yeah, I'm on the grid.
88400	92000	I am so looking forward to hearing your thoughts on some of tonight's stories, as I know some
92000	95600	of our listeners are, because we are the show, of course, where every gamer has a voice.
95600	98720	We don't always get to report the news, but we're here to talk about it with you guys
98720	103600	live in our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and of course, if you've never joined us for
103600	107160	a live show, it's a totally different experience, I really encourage you to.
107160	113240	Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, here at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,
113240	117800	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and we do have some folks in our chatroom already
117800	120360	starting there, and let's see, what do we got here?
120360	124840	SSJ100Matt says, this episode of OLR is brought to you by a higher debt ceiling.
124840	129720	I hope they got all that crap fixed, but I hear it's still a stalemate, but I don't want
129720	133360	to get too political, because I'll just get angry, because that stuff kind of has a direct
133360	137120	impact on my life, if that starts affecting the unemployment and all that, like they're
137120	138480	saying is going to happen.
138480	142360	So let's try to move on to happier topics, like games, that keep us entertained when
142360	144980	these things go wrong in our country.
144980	148920	So DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with, how was your gaming week?
148920	155440	Um, it was, I played WoW all up until the show, I was trying to get that achievement,
155440	158680	the classic dungeon master, whatever.
158680	161280	You know, achievements weren't around when you first started playing WoW, do you think
161280	165200	achievements have kind of, clearly they were just ripped right off Xbox Live, but do you
165200	168000	think they've really added something to the WoW experience?
168000	173000	Well yeah, I think it's, you know, I mean, they don't really give you any, well yeah,
173000	176400	some of them give you stuff, like you'll get titles for some of them, or you'll get pets
176400	179400	from some, or mounts from some, those are the ones with incentive.
179400	182800	Nothing that gives you a distinct advantage, but all the cosmetic stuff, Barbie doll things.
182800	187120	Yeah, but I mean, it's kind of fun, you know, I'll get like a wild hair and say, okay I'm
187120	192440	gonna finish this, and then it'll give me an excuse, because honestly, my favorite character
192440	194800	to play is my 85 mage.
194800	201080	I love my mage, and so it just gives me an excuse to keep playing her, instead of, oh,
201080	206400	I can't really do anything right now, so I'll just, I guess, work on this other one instead
206400	210000	of making another mage and leveling another mage.
210000	215640	I don't know somebody though who has 8 level 85 druids.
215640	218440	Well anything in the non-MMO universe that you've been up to?
218440	219440	Groovecoaster!
219440	223120	That game is fun, and I blame Shane.
223120	224240	It's his fault.
224240	226360	And Groovecoaster of course on the iOS, right?
226360	228440	It's iPad and iPhone, right?
228440	229440	Yes, 3GS and iPad.
229440	232960	I'm assuming it'll work on the iPod, unlike Google+, apparently.
232960	236040	Does not work on anything with the iPhone, which is a little silly, but.
236040	239080	And the app really is not that great.
239080	242080	It's more stable than Facebook's app at this point.
242080	247600	But you know I haven't updated Facebook apps since they changed the photos, so I didn't
247600	250400	update to that one because someone warned me.
250400	254520	So I haven't updated my Facebook app in, like, months.
254520	255520	Nice.
255520	257520	And I'm not going to.
257520	262640	I don't know what's going to come of all this little Google+, versus Facebook, especially
262640	267360	when the inevitable games start rolling out, which I believe the early rumors said today,
267360	270380	July 31st was the day they were going to start rolling out, but we haven't seen them yet,
270380	272760	so maybe tomorrow on a Monday.
272760	273760	Maybe it got pushed back.
273760	274760	Who knows?
274760	277120	It's going to be very interesting when the games roll out, because it's going to make
277120	278440	the two go head-to-head even more.
278440	284480	But right now, I think it's still too early to tell, but I think a little valid competition.
284480	288000	And yeah, clearly everybody wants a piece of the social networking space.
288000	294120	But you know, Facebook, or I should say Google+, has really succeeded at biting at Facebook's
294120	301200	kneecaps in places where MySpace, Orkut, Buzz, even, and other social networks have failed
301200	302200	to do so.
302200	304720	Just wait until MySpace rolls out their even better game service.
304720	306560	They're coming back, baby.
306560	308000	Well, you never know.
308000	309000	You never know.
309000	315520	I mean, as things change ownership and things change hands and so forth, you never know.
315520	317960	Don't ever count out somebody who's been gone for a while.
317960	320680	I mean, look at Origin, right?
320680	323840	Origin was an EA brand that kind of disappeared, unfortunately, because they used to make a
323840	325480	lot of great games back in the day.
325480	326800	And then the brand faded.
326800	328080	Now it's back as a store.
328080	330440	It could be interesting.
330440	332040	Could MySpace come back as a store?
332040	333040	Probably not.
333040	337240	Anyhow, I just want to say, the competition, I think, is a little bit healthy for Facebook.
337240	342920	Well, you know, they do say that festering piles of crap work as fertilizer.
342920	345040	So maybe some weeds might grow out of that.
345040	349160	But no, I've been playing Groove Coaster, which is basically across.
349160	356600	It's like, it's kind of like Frequency, where you have the track, but you tap it and hold
356600	365260	it, you know, the lines a lot like Oendon or Elite Beat Agents, but the lines keep moving
365260	368960	and they'll sneak up on you and like the track will curve.
368960	371600	And that has a very Vib ribbon type of vibe to it.
371600	375560	It really just made me think of playing Vib ribbon, except, you know, you're just pushing
375560	377800	little, you know, you're tapping along.
377800	380640	And sometimes it's easy to figure out what the rhythm is, but sometimes it's really freaking
380640	381640	difficult.
381640	384880	I'm still kind of getting used to it, but it's got the first Arkanoid song, which is
384880	388560	boop, boop, you know, that was pretty fun.
388560	391680	And I actually got a little motion sick off of it.
391680	392680	Wow.
392680	393680	So I don't know that it'd be able to play it on.
393680	398800	Well, it is very light, seizure-y, you know, fast emotions.
398800	402440	It's on the parts where it starts spiraling downwards, then that's where I get a little
402440	404140	motion sick.
404140	405140	It's very interesting.
405140	407320	I've been playing a lot of Groove Coaster this week, too, because obviously, you know,
407320	408320	I love music games.
408320	409320	It's a dollar.
409320	410320	No secret.
410320	411320	Yeah.
411320	414360	I think the price might go up soon to three bucks if it hasn't already, but it's been
414360	418320	a dollar that during launch weekend, it's been like an iTunes featured game by Taito,
418320	422520	of course, seeing people that do Space Invaders, clearly the same team that did the last Space
422520	428200	Invaders, not Space Invaders Extreme, but the other one that was on iPhone or iOS, Infinity
428200	429200	Gene.
429200	430200	Thank you.
430200	431200	It's still a buck.
431200	432200	Nice.
432200	434860	So I definitely, if you're a music game fan at all, you definitely want to check out Space
434860	436720	Invaders, or excuse me, not Space Invaders.
436720	439760	Well, you can check out Space Invaders, too, but a Groove Coaster is only a buck.
439760	444760	And what I love so much about this game, it's the perfect phone game, in my opinion.
444760	448000	It's everything you want out of a phone game, because...
448000	452240	Except, you cannot sneak into the bathroom at work and play it unless you have your headphones.
452240	453520	Well, yes, there is that.
453520	454600	I suppose there is that.
454600	458120	But the thing about Groove Coaster is that you can play it in short little minute and
458120	459860	a half, three minute boosts.
459860	461760	It's very pretty to watch.
461760	468080	So it's that kind of like audio stimulation, visual stimulation, little diversion for just
468080	469080	a few minutes.
469080	471880	Or you could sit there and play every song and be diverted for an hour.
471880	472880	But no trans vibrator mode.
472880	473880	No, no trans vibrator mode.
473880	479800	But I think in some ways, it's like just, it was designed very well with the phone audience
479800	480800	in mind.
480800	481920	And I think that's what's great about it.
481920	485840	Because half of playing it is kind of just those visuals of going around the spirals
485840	490080	and, ooh, ah, I'm in a trance for three minutes, wasting my time.
490080	496680	Groove Coaster is a very good word because it really is like this massive galactic roller
496680	497680	coaster.
497680	499440	And it even shows you the track when you're done.
499440	501440	So I think that's kind of cool.
501440	502440	Yeah, that's cool.
502440	503440	See the path you've been on.
503440	506520	Yes, because there's a level later, I won't spoil it, but one of the levels when you see
506520	511040	the path, you're like, it kind of fits the song and you're like, oh, now that's clever.
511040	513560	I didn't realize that was, that's clever.
513560	514560	Yeah.
514560	517920	I really, I really had a good time with it.
517920	523260	Like I said, I've gotten up to the first Arkanoid song, which is like, what, the second stage
523260	527680	or second set of stages or something.
527680	532200	And there's different, you know, I guess musicians that have worked on the tracks for the game.
532200	533760	So it's pretty cool.
533760	537000	And then that's really been about it.
537000	541920	I mean, I've, I've had a lot of art projects to do this week, so I haven't had too much
541920	542960	of the way of free time.
542960	546600	I've done a lot of going to the gym.
546600	547600	Working it?
547600	548600	Yeah, actually.
548600	549600	Yeah.
549600	550600	I'm doing cross training now.
550600	552520	Now at some point I'm going to have to loan you one of my connect games.
552520	553520	Oh, you guys have connect or no?
553520	554520	I have a connect.
554520	556720	I haven't opened because I haven't had anything I want to play.
556720	559320	Well, you'll have to try one of these fitness games that I was trying out.
559320	560320	You might be into it.
560320	561720	If you're all about fitness and stuff.
561720	563720	I really want to try the UFC game.
563720	564720	Oh yeah.
564720	566760	I've heard interesting things about that.
566760	570920	I don't know if I want to train to be an ultimate fighter, but, uh, I don't know.
570920	574440	I mean, sometimes in these arguments, I got to take Jamie out.
574440	580920	You know, I need to smite all those who oppose me with my mighty fist are all right.
580920	584440	Uh, well then if that's it for dark soccer's gaming week, how was your gaming week?
584440	585440	Logie?
585440	586440	Uh, it was actually pretty good.
586440	587920	I played lots of things.
587920	590760	Um, so let's start off with the usual stuff.
590760	594040	Of course played grand theft auto.
594040	595480	Not much more I can say there.
595480	599080	Uh, lots of versus defense force, which has been pretty fun.
599080	601640	Been playing some co-op with my coworker.
601640	607280	And then, um, then we had our company game summit thing.
607280	611280	So some of the publishers brought out things for me to try.
611280	612280	Oh yeah.
612280	616360	You got, you got a little, little, little slice of E3 at your door this week, didn't
616360	617360	you?
617360	618360	Very small slice of E3.
618360	619360	All right.
619360	620360	Well, what'd you check out?
620360	621360	Okay.
621360	626920	So I played the newest build of, uh, connect star Wars and there's a couple of things about
626920	627920	it.
627920	632240	Um, they said that apparently they took, um, development staff off of dance central two
632240	635680	to finish polishing up connect star Wars.
635680	637480	But harmonics makes dance central.
637480	639680	Yeah, but it's still Microsoft.
639680	643220	Oh, Microsoft doesn't own harmonics.
643220	645400	But they still have staff working on that.
645400	646400	Okay.
646400	650080	I'm a little, that seems a little, it's just, it's, or is it one of those disingenuous things
650080	651960	where we moved some of the marketing staff?
651960	652960	No, no, no, no.
652960	654760	It has nothing to do with the development staff.
654760	657880	It's the same thing as it's Lucas arts making the game.
657880	658880	Yes.
658880	659880	I understand that.
659880	660880	Yeah.
660880	661880	Okay.
661880	662880	Okay.
662880	663880	That's what the rep told me.
663880	664880	I'm just repeating what I heard.
664880	665880	A little strange, but all right.
665880	667880	Especially different coasts to Lucas arts is over in the Bay area.
667880	668880	Right.
668880	671720	And then I don't know where their video game development houses, I'm assuming it's North
671720	673640	Bay like the rest of Lucas arts.
673640	676700	But uh, then of course a harmonics is out in Boston.
676700	680440	So I'm saying I don't know.
680440	681440	Okay.
681440	682440	All right.
682440	683440	Whatever.
683440	684440	Fair enough.
684440	685920	Um, you know, I'd have assumed it's more than just maybe one development house working on
685920	686920	it.
686920	687920	Whatever.
687920	688920	Okay.
688920	689920	So.
689920	690920	Played a bit of connect Star Wars.
690920	696720	They had, of course, you know, at comic con, uh, the new build had pod racing in it.
696720	702560	And um, also they had, you know, the regular, just a little demo thing that you go through.
702560	705840	Uh, yeah.
705840	709840	You know, it's all right, I guess.
709840	714840	But once again, it's just kind of, you could tell how well it's going to be just by looking
714840	716800	at it and the videos and stuff.
716800	720640	And it right for me, it plays okay.
720640	725520	But like the stuff that they want me to do, like for example, in, in the E3 demo, you
725520	732920	may remember the guy trying to, um, knock the ship off the side of the whatever and
732920	737320	the walkway and he dropped it and then he, you know, brought it back.
737320	738700	Yes, there's that problem.
738700	744440	But I had a bigger problem because apparently they want you to knock it off the other side.
744440	748480	You can knock it off either side, but they wanted you to knock it off the left side cause
748480	750520	it's a lot easier to do it.
750520	753120	So I ended up not knowing that obviously.
753120	757420	So I moved it to the right trying to get it to fall off the edge of the thing.
757420	761840	So I got it to the point where it's literally sitting on the edge teetering, not quite moving
761840	762840	off the edge.
762840	766320	And I'm at the point where I'm, why do I have to knock it off the edge?
766320	771880	There's clearly like 20 feet of space next to it that I could run by, you know, since
771880	776840	I'm a Jedi, I think I can be able to manage to, you know, fit my ego through that 20 foot
776840	780320	patch of space there to, um, you know, get where I need to go.
780320	783760	Or I don't know, maybe because since my character can force jump anyways, I could have just
783760	786460	hopped over the goddamn thing instead of knocking off the edge.
786460	789240	But no, the game wants you to knock it over the edge and before you can move on.
789240	794140	So I'm sitting there like pushing at it, like tap, tap, tap, come on, get off the damn edge.
794140	796660	Finally got the tip over and then I moved on.
796660	800180	But um, yeah, the controls are a little bit wonky still.
800180	801240	They're still working it out.
801240	807180	And then pod racing, well, it works about as well as any Kinect based racing game.
807180	811520	And you know, pod, pod racing would be something that I would imagine that would require a
811520	816920	lot of precision, which the Kinect unfortunately just does not deliver.
816920	819940	Let me read this comment from our chat room at chat.orangeonstrader.com.
819940	824680	We have Doing Laundry Man is in chat saying, is Kinect Star Wars gonna be fun after a night
824680	825680	of binge drinking?
825680	829200	And that's kind of a similar question I have is that, you know, Loki, obviously you're
829200	833040	what we would call a hardcore gamer, you play a lot of Grand Theft Auto IV and, you know,
833040	835700	a lot of these other games that you take very seriously.
835700	839200	Or you may be approaching Kinect Star Wars with too much of the hardcore angles.
839200	843860	It's more something that kids are gonna really eat up and this is gonna be fun at parties
843860	845420	and drunken nights.
845420	849160	It's not like, I mean, it's kind of on rails, sort of.
849160	853880	I mean, you can dash towards things and you can dodge stuff.
853880	857860	But you know, all the gestures are very basic and you know, it's still very early.
857860	863500	I mean, the game right now, it's probably not even in beta and it's, you know, July
863500	865400	and the game's coming out in November.
865400	870280	So there's still plenty of time, you know, to polish it up and it's playable.
870280	871280	It's not terrible.
871280	874760	I mean, it's just not something I would buy.
874760	876260	But it's all right.
876260	879640	It's just something that like if someone likes The Force Unleashed or something like that,
879640	882100	they're not probably gonna get a lot out of this.
882100	884260	Let's say Josh was 11.
884260	885480	Would you want to buy it then?
885480	887040	He'd probably dig it.
887040	888040	Yeah.
888040	892720	That's where I'm thinking this is going to, is that this is very much for the same audience
892720	894800	that kind of supported the connect to begin with.
894800	895800	It wasn't really the hardcore.
895800	901840	It was more of the, I don't want to say soccer mom even, but just the family crowd.
901840	902960	And thank God.
902960	907880	One thing that they did get rid of, because it was really stupid in the demo, was the
907880	908880	lightsaber on!
908880	912040	You know, that was just retarded.
912040	916480	Now you just put your hand out and the lightsaber comes out and that's it.
916480	918320	Maybe you still could say lightsaber on.
918320	919320	Yeah, I wouldn't.
919320	921800	Okay, that would be terrible.
921800	923920	So it was okay.
923920	925720	Pod racing though, I was slamming the walls.
925720	926720	But you know what?
926720	929640	I blame that probably a little bit on myself because I didn't know how to control a damn
929640	931640	thing.
931640	937760	I went through the tutorial for the single player regular game portion, but the rep just
937760	943400	put me straight into the game for the pod racing and so I guess there's dual throttles
943400	944400	on that thing.
944400	951280	So I was just like, full speed all the time, maybe that's not the greatest thing.
951280	956200	But the game itself though, the pod racing, it's very much like the movie.
956200	957200	It's kind of cool.
957200	961600	So if they get the controls correct, it might not be that bad.
961600	964600	Do they have Greg Proops doing the announcing during the Star Wars sequence?
964600	967440	Because I'll tell you, a shout out to one of my other favorite podcasts, Smartest Man
967440	970400	in the World with Greg Proops.
970400	973680	He was in Star Wars Episode I narrating the pod races, he was one of the two heads on
973680	974680	the team.
974680	975680	I think he is.
975680	976680	Is he really?
976680	977680	It's the same voices.
977680	978680	Awesome.
978680	979680	Yes.
979680	982760	So yeah, that'll be cool.
982760	983760	So it was alright.
983760	990200	And then the other game I saw was Skylanders, which is the new Spyro game.
990200	994640	And you know, I was just sitting there with the two Activision reps and one of them, I
994640	997560	mentioned them like, you know, it was like $70.
997560	1001640	I mean really, you think people are gonna buy this, you know.
1001640	1003160	And they think that it's gonna sell well.
1003160	1008120	I mean it's kind of neat, I guess, for kids because you can just pop this little toy on
1008120	1012680	there and you know, away you go and you can play as that character.
1012680	1016120	And they're gonna have, I guess, 30 characters that you can play in the game.
1016120	1017960	But the thing is that kind of sucks.
1017960	1022480	You need certain characters to go access certain parts of the game, like you know, if you want
1022480	1025780	to go underwater you can't use a fire monster, you have to use something else.
1025780	1029400	So they kind of want you to buy the toys, which are fucking expensive.
1029400	1031640	They're like $8 each.
1031640	1035120	And you know, $8 for an action figure, that's not so bad.
1035120	1036120	You know, G.I.
1036120	1038380	Joe's, I used to buy those and that makes sense.
1038380	1040800	But these are like, they're figurines.
1040800	1041800	They don't move.
1041800	1043120	They don't articulate at all.
1043120	1046960	They're just not, you know, not, it's just mainly for the game.
1046960	1052860	It's like physical download content is basically what this is.
1052860	1053940	So it's an experiment.
1053940	1054940	I guess it'll be alright.
1054940	1060640	But I mean, if you're a fan of Spyro and you really want to play a Spyro game, I would
1060640	1063840	check this out as a demo or something first, because it's...
1063840	1068000	I was gonna say, I will admit, I kind of got sick of Spyro.
1068000	1072320	Like Spyro just kind of got oversaturated, but I haven't played a Spyro game in so long
1072320	1075880	that I think back to like the original one on PlayStation 1, like very fondly.
1075880	1076880	This is not like that.
1076880	1077880	Oh, that's too bad.
1077880	1083160	I mean, it's like that in the world sense, but it's not, like Spyro looks fucking angry
1083160	1084160	in it.
1084160	1085160	It's just like he's...
1085160	1086160	Spyro got more hardcore.
1086160	1088520	He's like, what the fuck did you do to my games?
1088520	1089520	I was so fucking pissed!
1089520	1093040	You know, he just has this angry look on his face.
1093040	1095000	They made him like emo-ragey.
1095000	1096200	They're targeting a new audience.
1096200	1098400	They're targeting angry people with money.
1098400	1101320	So it was alright, you know.
1101320	1104480	I didn't get to play Just Dance 3, because...
1104480	1109000	Oh, I bet you're just, you're just torn up about that one.
1109000	1110720	It was, Just Dance 2 was pretty fun.
1110720	1114160	I played it, you know.
1114160	1116600	Just Dance 3 on all the consoles now, or is that just Wii?
1116600	1123800	She was gonna bring in all the Wii, bring a Wii dev kit, because she had that, but unfortunately
1123800	1126080	they had issues with syncing controllers or something.
1126080	1129400	I did get to play Ninja Gaiden 3, and that's fucking amazing.
1129400	1131320	It's just such a great game.
1131320	1132320	Really?
1132320	1134360	Now, you didn't really play the other ones, right?
1134360	1135360	No.
1135360	1136800	So you weren't really ever into this series, right?
1136800	1137800	No, not really.
1137800	1141720	Okay, so you just randomly said, hey, here's a new game, I'll try it, and you're like,
1141720	1142720	whoa.
1142720	1143720	Hell yeah.
1143720	1144720	It's just really, really violent.
1144720	1145720	Of course.
1145720	1146720	Of course.
1146720	1150600	Because every time you, like, slash through somebody and you cut people, like, in half
1150600	1155040	and stuff, it, like, goes in really close.
1155040	1160160	Basically, they were saying, you know, that the theme this year was that they wanted to,
1160160	1166600	uh, I guess, convey the feeling of slicing somebody in half, you know?
1166600	1167600	Is what they're...
1167600	1168600	Well!
1168600	1169600	What they're trying to go for.
1169600	1171920	Alright, now I'm bringing up a YouTube here so I can try and see some of this here.
1171920	1175640	I'm just randomly finding a YouTube channel, hoping there's no narration in the background
1175640	1176640	here.
1176640	1178760	Ah, I don't want to hear this dude narrating.
1178760	1185080	Let's see if we can find something else a little more.
1185080	1187200	I don't remember there being alligators.
1187200	1188480	This could be just some...
1188480	1191480	This is just a YouTube spam.
1191480	1193320	YouTube really needs to clean up their crap.
1193320	1195560	Ninja Gaiden with 100% more alligators.
1195560	1196560	Clearly.
1196560	1197560	Clearly.
1197560	1199480	I don't know if I'm gonna find it.
1199480	1203240	Uh, okay, well, this one says G4 TV.
1203240	1204920	We'll see how well this goes.
1204920	1209840	I really don't want to hear Adam Sessler narrating over this stuff.
1209840	1211280	And of course there's his timing out.
1211280	1212800	Well, this segment's going nowhere.
1212800	1214080	Live Radio Boys and Girls.
1214080	1215080	It's awesome.
1215080	1216080	I'll just have to take Loki's word for it.
1216080	1217080	It's a pretty awesome game.
1217080	1220920	Granted, though, that the difficulty was ramped way down because it is a demo and they don't
1220920	1224360	want everybody to fail on it, but there is gonna be, like, I guess, some sort of casual
1224360	1230000	gaming mode or, like, an easy mode or something you can play, so, um, but, you know, just
1230000	1231000	really over the top.
1231000	1232000	Fun game, though.
1232000	1233000	So.
1233000	1234000	Alright.
1234000	1235000	Was that it?
1235000	1236000	Uh, yeah.
1236000	1239640	Oh, did Ninja Gaiden 3 make you want to go back and play the other ones?
1239640	1241520	Uh, no.
1241520	1245360	Because Ninja Gaiden's not really a game I would think that I need to play the other
1245360	1246360	ones, you know?
1246360	1247880	Like, if you were to go play Ninja Gaiden 3.
1247880	1251040	Well, yeah, but if you liked 3, you might as well go back and see what you missed in
1251040	1252040	1 and 2.
1252040	1256500	I mean, 1's, well, obviously there's, obviously there's the old, old, old what?
1256500	1262360	There's the Atari arcade game and then there were the Nintendo NES games by Tecmo and now,
1262360	1266560	you know, you had this new trilogy that started, I believe, on Xbox, was, because Ninja Gaiden
1266560	1271280	was a huge exclusive for the original Xbox, uh, you know, and then, what, Ninja Gaiden
1271280	1275400	2 was on, I think, 360 and that?
1275400	1276400	Yeah.
1276400	1278800	Well, and they also have the PS3 ones, the Sigma series.
1278800	1279800	Right.
1279800	1280800	Right.
1280800	1281800	So, you could always check that out.
1281800	1289440	Yeah, I mean, it's not, you know, not really something I necessarily need to do, but, uh.
1289440	1295480	Uh, going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, uh, DoingLaundryMan in our chatroom says,
1295480	1296680	chopping people in half?
1296680	1298760	Loki finally gets to live one of his dreams.
1298760	1299760	Oh!
1299760	1304240	Oh, speaking, uh, just my, not really the chopping people in half thing, but I, I did
1304240	1307960	remember there was a few other things, I didn't get to play, but stuff I learned, which is
1307960	1308960	kinda cool.
1308960	1309960	Okay.
1309960	1316560	Um, Saints Row the Third, I got a little peek at, uh, cause, you know, I fucking love Saints.
1316560	1320800	I know, you're just, you're just eating that stuff up with a spoon, you are so excited,
1320800	1322640	you're gonna be there at midnight.
1322640	1327000	No, a couple things about Saints Row the Third.
1327000	1332880	One, I, I was looking at their, they had their kinda lineup of, um, their advertising campaign,
1332880	1335720	so everything they're doing up from now to launch.
1335720	1341680	And one of the things that's later on, not announced yet, um, is a new mode that they're
1341680	1345880	gonna have, like, you know, all the other games have, you know, their kind of, uh, horde
1345880	1352840	mode and stuff like that, well they're gonna have horde mode, as in whores, and basically
1352840	1357040	when you turn in, you turn on horde mode, random prosti-
1357040	1359040	Like, w-h-o-r-e-d mode.
1359040	1360040	Yes.
1360040	1361040	Horde mode, okay.
1361040	1364160	Random prostitutes will attack you on the streets.
1364160	1365160	It's awesome.
1365160	1367080	I'm just like, yes!
1367080	1368320	This game is amazing.
1368320	1370360	Uh, what game do I wanna play today?
1370360	1375080	I know, I wanna get attacked by prostitutes, just armies of prostitutes.
1375080	1376360	Are they yelling things at you?
1376360	1377360	You know, like-
1377360	1381000	I don't know, but it's gonna be awesome.
1381000	1382820	So that, that's something they're gonna be talking about.
1382820	1389440	They're gonna have some sort of invite-only, uh, demo thing that my, uh, THQ rep says that
1389440	1393360	they're gonna try, cause I'm such a huge fan, they're gonna try to get me into, and oh god
1393360	1396480	if that would happen, I don't know what I would do.
1396480	1399680	It almost sounds like you took that rep in the back alley and did what you had to do
1399680	1401680	to get a sneak peek.
1401680	1405160	Alright, he'll keep us posted.
1405160	1410920	Uh, also go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com, uh, let's see, Spyro is in chat right now.
1410920	1415840	At least somebody named Spyro is in chat saying, I'm probably the biggest Spyro fan here and
1415840	1417640	I'm glad the game is like the original.
1417640	1420160	I thought the Legend series brought it down.
1420160	1426580	Uh, and let's see, uh, uh, Spazinator in our chatroom says, agreed, I was just playing
1426580	1427960	Ninja Gaiden 2 the other day.
1427960	1430800	The camera needs improvement to put it mildly.
1430800	1432000	So, there you go.
1432000	1436240	And Act Defta is hearing you talking about, uh, Saints Row the Third saying, best game
1436240	1437240	ever, period.
1437240	1438920	Hold on guys, the game's not out yet.
1438920	1442320	What you don't wanna do, do not hype the game beyond your expectations because you'll only
1442320	1443320	set yourself up for disappointment.
1443320	1446880	Um, so, I'm just gonna tell you guys now, Saints Row sucks.
1446880	1448280	It fucking blows.
1448280	1453520	That way if it's good, you'll be- Sonic Generations sounds like it's gonna have a lot of fan service
1453520	1454520	in it.
1454520	1460880	Including, I guess, there's, um, different things that you unlock by beating, uh, certain,
1460880	1463880	uh, challenges in each level, including some of the original games.
1463880	1467200	You can unlock Sonic 1 in there and some other stuff.
1467200	1468200	Interesting.
1468200	1469200	Yeah.
1469200	1470200	Okay.
1470200	1471360	Uh, so, let's see, Sonic 1.
1471360	1475960	How many times has that game been hoarded out in the past, uh, few years?
1475960	1479160	Let's see, we had the Sonic Mega Genesis Collection.
1479160	1482320	You could pay 400 Microsoft points and get it that way.
1482320	1486880	Uh, now it's gonna be an unlockable in another game and that's not counting when we saw it
1486880	1490400	probably back on the GameCube and every other collection known to man.
1490400	1494040	I mean, how many times are you gonna pimp out Sonic?
1494040	1499120	And I saw a new trailer for Dead Rising 2, uh, off the record or whatever.
1499120	1500840	Looks fucking amazing.
1500840	1504120	So in other words, Dead Rising 2, the way we meant to do it.
1504120	1508240	It looks hilarious because the last few trailers that I've seen for it, it's just been kind
1508240	1509240	of a teaser.
1509240	1513360	This is just, you know, him wearing, you know, little children's clothing and just doing
1513360	1515300	all sorts of weird shit.
1515300	1517880	It's awesome.
1517880	1520560	I love some of the random comments our chatters make sometimes.
1520560	1526440	SSG100Matt in our chat room says, I think in the Bizarro world, Bizarro Loki likes playing
1526440	1533440	sports games, MMOs, enjoys eating steamed broccoli, and looking at tasteful porn.
1533440	1538240	I enjoyed MMOs and tasteful porn.
1538240	1539240	So fuck steamed broccoli.
1539240	1542160	Yeah, fuck steamed broccoli, that's disgusting.
1542160	1545120	Alright, moving on, my gaming week.
1545120	1546480	Not a whole lot of new stuff.
1546480	1549760	Again, I've kind of been focusing on many of the games I already have.
1549760	1552640	I've been playing those, including, of course, WoW.
1552640	1553960	Been revisiting some old stuff.
1553960	1558120	I was randomly playing some Super Street Fighter IV this week as well as Wipeout HD, which
1558120	1561800	I finally looked at the Fury expansion, what, like two years later?
1561800	1567520	You know, well, since in my household there's two of us and we share a Playstation 3, so
1567520	1571640	I got two of the games, and then Salacious Pop got two other games, so he got the Wipeout
1571640	1573200	with Fury in it.
1573200	1574200	So that.
1574200	1578360	And I played the Bomberman game because it's free on Playstation Plus right now, and since
1578360	1582960	I didn't cash in the Playstation Plus until right at the end, I'm still on it.
1582960	1587400	So Bomberman's free right now, and I played that, and it's...
1587400	1592800	Bomberman was great, like, in 95, and now it's just, it's something that's better left
1592800	1593800	to my memory.
1593800	1595440	I forgot I signed up for Playstation Plus, ehh.
1595440	1596840	Yeah, there's some free games.
1596840	1597840	I didn't miss anything.
1597840	1598840	Go get some trophies or something.
1598840	1601440	Yeah, well it's free game, free until...
1601440	1604000	Free until the third or whenever it wears out, I know.
1604000	1606440	So you can check that out.
1606440	1610320	Also, as far as other games I've been playing that are a little bit newer, I talked about
1610320	1612880	Bastion last week, I said I'd only played the demo.
1612880	1617600	I did end up upgrading to the full version, and I'm glad I did, I'm still enjoying Bastion.
1617600	1621360	Some things that didn't show up in the demo, there's another weapon that I really like,
1621360	1625680	like a sword weapon that you can throw, that's pretty cool, and you know, I've just been
1625680	1630080	playing through a few stages of that, and you get some like training levels where you
1630080	1636680	get upgrades if you can use your weapons effectively, like there's one that is shoot all these little
1636680	1640740	pods with the least number of arrows possible, and it's just kind of interesting, it's like
1640740	1644520	half puzzle, half action, kind of neat, and then there was like another one I unlocked
1644520	1648000	later that was, you know, how fast can you slice everything up with your sword, which
1648000	1651200	is kind of cool, a little bit of a button mash, but in a fun way.
1651200	1655280	So yeah, I'm enjoying Bastion, so if you haven't checked that out, and especially if you like
1655280	1659320	kind of the old school platformers, I love that it's kind of like an old school platformer
1659320	1663600	with a very new school twist of the way the story is told, so I think it's pretty awesome.
1663600	1668720	I also checked out From Dust, this is just a demo, so again, these are impressions based
1668720	1674960	on a demo, I had heard it was like the old game's populace, which I loved that game back
1674960	1680040	in the day, so I was all about ready to try this, and I checked out the demo and it's
1680040	1688720	very, the way it's presented, the presentation of the game is great, I mean, everything is
1688720	1693240	very gorgeous, everything is well done, and the way it's put together, it felt like a
1693240	1697600	disc based game, honestly, I'm really surprised they packed all this into an arcade release,
1697600	1702840	although I think it was like a gig download, so I mean, and some 360 games are like several
1702840	1705720	hundred megs, so this is almost as big as a disc game.
1705720	1709720	I will say where I got frustrated though is that I honestly found the demo, I couldn't
1709720	1713520	really get past one of the stages in the demo, and I found it really frustrating because
1713520	1718240	the way I was laying down the sand or something was just not right, I mean, maybe I just need
1718240	1721760	to approach it again with a clear head, but it was one of those points of early frustration
1721760	1725480	where I'm like, well shit, if I can't beat the demo, then I ain't wasting my money on
1725480	1731600	the full game, but I liked where it was going, so I can't really say it reflects on the game
1731600	1736380	negatively, I think it's just one of those, try this for yourself, because it's something
1736380	1740080	you have to experience, but it's not really for everybody.
1740080	1744480	So that's the beautiful thing about Arcade, there's demos of every game, so if you like
1744480	1750360	those types of games like Populous, I'm trying to think what else, maybe Lemmings-esque,
1750360	1756760	I kind of reminded of that a little bit, you might enjoy this game, so check that out.
1756760	1762640	That's really otherwise about it, I want to get my classic game on next weekend, I was
1762640	1767680	talking to Salacious Pop about wanting to hook up the Dreamcast to play the NES emulator
1767680	1770440	to go play some old games, so I might do some of that this weekend.
1770440	1774520	I forgot a game I played this week, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.
1774520	1776520	Oh my gosh.
1776520	1779200	Wow, old school, where the hell did that come from?
1779200	1780200	Wasn't that on Sega CD?
1780200	1782200	I think there was a version on Sega CD.
1782200	1783960	I think there was a version on Genesis though.
1783960	1790520	I played it on my arcade cabinet, it was fun, I don't know, I just wanted to play a beat
1790520	1797320	em up game that wasn't Ninja Turtles or something I'd played before, so Cadillacs and Dinosaurs
1797320	1798320	it was.
1798320	1802000	And there's a character in there that looks just like Blanca, except he has a tail and
1802000	1803000	weird eyes.
1803000	1808040	By the way, Rob, didn't we give you a NES?
1808040	1809040	You did.
1809040	1810040	Okay.
1810040	1811040	But I don't have a lot of carts.
1811040	1812040	I have some.
1812040	1814560	I was going to say, I'd be more than happy to do some games.
1814560	1815560	We'll see, we'll see.
1815560	1818960	So that you can have the excitement of blowing into the cartridges and then into the machine
1818960	1819960	and then swabbing them.
1819960	1824120	Going to our chatroom at chat.org.com, some comments from our chat, Black Wolf, the man
1824120	1828280	before us, Sunday nights at all games is in chat saying, Sky, take out the narrator.
1828280	1830680	Is Bastion still worth it?
1830680	1832080	Yes.
1832080	1836000	But keep in mind, you know, every gamer is a little different.
1836000	1840720	And I really like these isometric platformy type of games.
1840720	1845600	You know, some of my favorite games going back to the NES, the Super NES era are Solstice
1845600	1847320	and Equinox and that series.
1847320	1852160	And this game to me really kind of harkens back to those games.
1852160	1856840	Certainly the narrator adds a lot of ambience to it and, you know, just makes the storytelling,
1856840	1862040	I guess it makes it less just pictures on a screen.
1862040	1866800	And it really does add to the ambience of the game and the story that you're trying
1866800	1867800	to get immersed in.
1867800	1871440	But if you were to take it out, I would still be interested in this game.
1871440	1872440	Yeah.
1872440	1876280	I don't think it's the sole motivator, but it just makes a good thing better.
1876280	1877760	If that makes sense.
1877760	1881480	If only they had that narrator in Saints Row the Third.
1881480	1882480	You never know.
1882480	1888120	And then he decided to stand there and flip off the prostitute.
1888120	1890640	Derek H. in the chat says, From Dust is great.
1890640	1893680	And yeah, I'll admit, I probably didn't give it a fair chance.
1893680	1896600	You know, it was late last night and I just kind of got fed up and I was like, I'm just
1896600	1897600	gonna go back to Street Fighter.
1897600	1898600	Fuck this.
1898600	1903080	So I'm going to approach it again a little later on because I refuse to believe that
1903080	1906720	I wouldn't really get more out of this game considering I really used to like the Sim
1906720	1910240	City, the Populous, and those types of games back in the day.
1910240	1914580	And I keep saying Populous because that's the one I am really reminded of.
1914580	1918240	This really does feel like just an all new version of that game.
1918240	1921680	So all right, moving on.
1921680	1923260	That's pretty much it for our gaming weeks.
1923260	1927700	So let's move on to some housekeeping tonight of which we don't have a whole lot.
1927700	1930480	We still have every show planned for the month.
1930480	1932580	I don't think we have any shows planned off.
1932580	1935540	There might be one at the end of August because I'm going to be gone at the end of August,
1935540	1937080	but that's that's a ways off.
1937080	1939720	You are not going on any trips after all.
1939720	1944560	So we'll be having shows for the foreseeable future for at least the next four weeks.
1944560	1945760	Oh, nonsense.
1945760	1947400	That's why that's why you have MMOs.
1947400	1948880	You're never lonely.
1948880	1951200	You will not be forever alone.
1951200	1953540	All right.
1953540	1956880	If you know what, if you're feeling forever alone, Dark Soccer, you should just hop into
1956880	1960200	our chat room during the week and say, I can has hug and there's there's people in there
1960200	1961200	throughout the week.
1961200	1962200	They'll just say hugs.
1962200	1963200	There you go.
1963200	1964200	OK.
1964200	1966840	I challenge you to do that twice this week.
1966840	1969200	OK, we'll see.
1969200	1970800	All right.
1970800	1973320	Otherwise, visit our Web site, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1973320	1976840	Of course, you can always visit us on Twitter, Twitter dot com slash O.L.R..

1983280	1985040	So Twitter dot com slash O.L.R. for that.
1985040	1986800	Of course, we are on Facebook as well.

1988800	1991040	We're on Tumblr now.
1991040	1993280	I don't think we've been posting a lot there, but it's there.
1993280	1994800	Orange Lounge Radio dot Tumblr dot com.
1994800	1995800	Right.
1995800	1996800	Is that right?
1996800	1997800	Orange Lounge Radio?
1997800	1998800	Yes.
1998800	1999800	It's new.
1999800	2000800	I don't know.
2000800	2001800	I don't know all the stuff now.
2001800	2002800	And it's new.
2002800	2003800	There you go.
2003800	2004800	Do we finally delete the Myspace?
2004800	2005800	We might have.
2005800	2009320	I think that's maybe the Myspace is just might be just an archive of old, old, old ass clips
2009320	2013600	in the to go edition, because that's how long it's been there, you know, like some treasure
2013600	2014600	fossil.
2014600	2015600	There you go.
2015600	2016600	There you go.
2016600	2019740	It's like a it'll be like something you discover like in from dust, like doing archaeology
2019740	2020740	and wow.
2020740	2021740	All right.
2021740	2024040	Anyhow, let's move on to some gaming news.
2024040	2031160	And I obviously the blogosphere has been blowing up this week with chat on a few topics.
2031160	2035000	And I know you're all dying to know what Loki thinks of some of this stuff.
2035000	2038360	I'm dying to know what you guys think of some of this stuff in our chat room.
2038360	2039360	Let's get to it.
2039360	2042160	Loki, we please do the honors of starting us off with the big news this week.
2042160	2043160	All right.
2043160	2047560	So Nintendo hasn't been doing that great with the 3DS.
2047560	2053720	They cut their profits forecast by 82 percent, basically dropping their estimated profit
2053720	2061080	from 20 billion yen or about two hundred and fifty seven million dollars to one hundred
2061080	2067680	and ten billion yen or about one point for one billion, I guess.
2067680	2071360	Or I'm sorry, I got that all backwards.
2071360	2078600	They dropped it down to two or 20 billion yen from 110 billion yen, which is quite a
2078600	2079600	drop.
2079600	2085400	And of course, you know, basing it on the fact that, you know, they they're saying that
2085400	2093680	the stronger than expected yen appreciation and sales performance of the 3DS hardware
2093680	2098200	and sales outlook for the holiday season.
2098200	2104400	They're going to be dropping the price, of course, of the 3DS on August 12th to one hundred
2104400	2109960	and seventy dollars from its two hundred and fifty dollar mark right now.
2109960	2115080	And I guess something similar is going to happen effective August 11th in Japan, dropping
2115080	2121740	the system from twenty five thousand yen to fifteen thousand yen.
2121740	2126560	And of course, there's no price yet in Europe, but I'm sure they're going to get some sort
2126560	2129760	of drop.
2129760	2133640	And then, of course, if you're having a little bit of buyers remorse because you bought a
2133640	2138360	launch system and you're like, what the fuck, you know, eighty dollars now, what am I going
2138360	2139360	to do?
2139360	2142660	Well, Nintendo is actually going to give you some free games.
2142660	2149960	And they said basically anybody that signs into Nintendo's eShop before August 12th will
2149960	2155500	be signed up automatically to the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador program.
2155500	2163480	And basically you get ten free NES virtual console games on September 1st.
2163480	2169660	And I guess it's before the release of the games for everybody else and also some Game
2169660	2170920	Boy Advance games.
2170920	2174540	Also that's kind of their way of saying, hey, we're going to have an NES virtual console
2174540	2179820	system on the 3DS and also going to offer Game Boy Advance games since this has never
2179820	2181880	been mentioned prior to this.
2181880	2186800	And, you know, some of the games that they're giving away, I mean, they're not half bad
2186800	2187800	actually.
2187800	2191060	It's, you know, like The Legend of Zelda, Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, of course they're
2191060	2195960	seeing some Game Boy Advance games, Yoshi's Island, Super Mario Advance 3, Mario Kart,
2195960	2205520	Metroid Fusion, WarioWare, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, so, you know, quite a few things.
2205520	2211240	And also, I guess, let's stop there before we get to some of the other stuff because
2211240	2213620	I want to dissect this a little bit because I've got to admit, when did this all come
2213620	2214620	down?
2214620	2216960	Like it was probably Wednesday or so when this was all announced.
2216960	2222480	And I've got to admit, I was reading, you know, the updates through Twitter and so forth
2222480	2227760	and through my Google Reader and I was like, what the hell is going on today?
2227760	2230160	I feel like I've stepped into Bizarro World.
2230160	2232100	What happened at Nintendo?
2232100	2237180	Like something huge went down there because this is just, does this even feel like the
2237180	2239480	same Nintendo from just a couple months ago?
2239480	2241440	It's the screams of desperation.
2241440	2248240	I mean, and when I told Salacious Pop about it, and I think he put it best, he said, wow,
2248240	2251800	Nintendo just totally ate shit.
2251800	2260040	And they really did, like, what, I mean, clearly the 3DS not performing up to expectations
2260040	2265000	and there's been a lot of flack on that, but I honestly didn't see this coming.
2265000	2267560	I mean, there's so much about this that's just out of character.
2267560	2270560	A, they didn't announce a price drop today.
2270560	2273760	They announced a price drop a few weeks from now.
2273760	2277920	And that's usually not what you want to do because that's kind of suicide to your sales
2277920	2278920	right away.
2278920	2286620	But then B, they turn around and announce this program with 20 free games, 20 Nintendo,
2286620	2292440	that is not, Nintuantido, that is not something I would have ever expected out of Nintendo.
2292440	2296280	But it gives people incentive to buy the game, the system at full price to get the freebies.
2296280	2297280	It does.
2297280	2301000	I don't get that perspective of it, but I still don't get it, like, I still don't get
2301000	2304280	it being Nintendo because I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2304280	2308240	Like I would have expected Nintendo to be like, oh, well, you know, well, we're going
2308240	2313600	to cut the price and, you know, we're going to give you some free club Nintendo points
2313600	2318520	or we're going to let you have Mario Brothers 2 early or something.
2318520	2322240	I was not expecting 20 games.
2322240	2327640	That is a huge, like, in my opinion is a huge admission of something on Nintendo.
2327640	2328680	Like we didn't just fuck up.
2328680	2331160	We fucked up big.
2331160	2336160	That's what's surprising about it to me is that to be honest, to be fair, I realize that
2336160	2340300	if I buy something early, like a 3DS, it's very likely to get a price cut in the future.
2340300	2344440	If they had announced a price drop and they said, oh, you only get a Mario game, I would
2344440	2348560	have been like, okay, well, you know, that's the price you pay for getting shit early.
2348560	2353080	Loki imported a 3DS and paid a premium to have it like a couple weeks early.
2353080	2355420	That's just what we do sometimes because we're sick.
2355420	2357320	We want to have the newest gadgets early.
2357320	2361280	I would have been perfectly fine with it, but now to hear there's like 20 free games
2361280	2362280	coming out.
2362280	2366960	Now I'm not just like, oh, I'm not unhappy about this price drop.
2366960	2371320	Now I'm like, fuck, I'm really glad I bought one early.
2371320	2375840	I mean, look at the games they're talking about on the Game Boy Advance, Metroid, Yoshi's
2375840	2376840	Island.
2376840	2379000	Metroid Fusion's fucking awesome.
2379000	2384520	They're not, there might be like half and half, half crap, half, but no, half triple
2384520	2385520	A titles.
2385520	2387080	I do have a point though to make.
2387080	2388080	What?
2388080	2391880	We're glad that we didn't get one because first of all, all of those games that are
2391880	2394520	worth having, I already own.
2394520	2396520	I bought them on my old system.
2396520	2399960	Second, we're not going to spend as much money.
2399960	2400960	Okay.
2400960	2404840	But hold that thought because Loki, you got to read this next bit then on this.
2404840	2407520	I know you're dying to give your impressions to, Loki, but I'm going to make the listeners
2407520	2408520	wait a minute.
2408520	2412720	So Loki, read this next story because here's, here's where things get real fucking interesting
2412720	2413720	real quick.
2413720	2418040	Uh, 3DS NES games will also include multiplayer following an update.
2418040	2425000	Yes, you'll be able to play those, um, virtual console games, um, I guess with other people
2425000	2426000	now.
2426000	2429200	I'm not sure if that's over the internet or if that's just locally, but that's kind
2429200	2430200	of interesting.
2430200	2433800	Um, and here's the list of NES games that they've announced.
2433800	2438880	Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong Jr, Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, and The Legend of Zelda,
2438880	2443320	and then of course five other unknown games right now.
2443320	2450120	So, they added multiplayer into virtual console and we don't know yet, but this possibly could
2450120	2453200	be over the internet.
2453200	2456320	They're doing what they should have done with the Wii five years ago?
2456320	2457320	Finally?
2457320	2463500	I mean, that makes these games a lot more, I mean, because let's face it, Nintendo is
2463500	2465280	kind of sucker punching us a little bit here.
2465280	2469640	If you didn't early adopt the 3DS and you do want to get these games and let's say they
2469640	2473000	do end up being multiplayer over the internet, you're going to have to buy them again.
2473000	2475080	Even if you bought them for five bucks the first time on the Wii, you're going to have
2475080	2476580	to buy them again.
2476580	2480560	But for the early adopters, now you're kind of in this, well, I can't really get mad cause
2480560	2482040	I'm still going to get it for free.
2482040	2485080	But Dark Sakura, let's say the multiplayer thing pans out.
2485080	2487720	Let's say it ends up that you can play it on the internet.
2487720	2491000	Now does that change your opinion or are you still like, no, at the end of the day I say
2491000	2492000	I'm saving 80 bucks.
2492000	2494060	I don't care about multiplayer.
2494060	2495640	I really don't.
2495640	2497640	So that's just, okay, good.
2497640	2500960	I'm glad for other people, but I don't care.
2500960	2501960	That's me.
2501960	2502960	Fair enough.
2502960	2503960	Fair enough.
2503960	2509960	Keep in mind how few times I've done any multiplayer game on Xbox live or I think the last multiplayer
2509960	2517400	game I've played that involved a Nintendo system was playing Super Mario Brothers.
2517400	2520760	And then that I didn't really like it with the multiplayer aspect.
2520760	2523200	So cause I was just like, stop being stupid.
2523200	2524200	Just let me play by myself.
2524200	2526880	You know, I was just getting annoyed.
2526880	2531140	So I do not play well with others.
2531140	2536680	Now I want to emphasize, we don't know for sure yet if multiplayer means multiplayer
2536680	2538200	on the internet.
2538200	2542080	We're all forming a prayer circle right now that for those of us that are in a multiplayer,
2542080	2544780	we're all forming a prayer circle that Nintendo is going to do the right thing and they are
2544780	2548440	going to open up the internet because if the emulation scene's been able to do it for years,
2548440	2551160	there's no reason Nintendo cannot open these games to play on the internet.
2551160	2556200	However, we should only expect that multiplayer means within the same room, which is still
2556200	2561160	interesting, I guess.
2561160	2565880	I don't know if I would repay $5 for these games for that alone, but if Nintendo is going
2565880	2569280	to hand them to me for free, I'm not exactly going to bash them.
2569280	2571280	You know what I mean?
2571280	2573040	And then here's another interesting thing.
2573040	2582560	Apparently, Satori Iwata, he's gone ahead and taken a 50% reduction in pay as a result
2582560	2584920	of the 3DS's slow sales.
2584920	2585920	What?
2585920	2587320	Who are you people?
2587320	2589920	Nintendo, I don't even know you anymore.
2589920	2593640	You're taking pay cuts now?
2593640	2602600	Other representative directors, including senior managing directors Miyamoto and Shinji
2602600	2610520	Hatano, are taking a 30% pay cut and other executives will lose 20% off their salaries.
2610520	2614200	I bet you anything that will not happen to Nintendo US.
2614200	2617320	I think they said Reggie's one of the affected people, right?
2617320	2618320	Uh, no.
2618320	2619320	Oh, interesting.
2619320	2621120	I didn't pick up on that.
2621120	2623800	Doing something like that is, honestly, it's...
2623800	2627380	It is the corporate equivalent of falling on your sword.
2627380	2629000	It's very much a Japanese thing.
2629000	2630140	Oh yeah.
2630140	2635880	To take responsibility, you know, for the sake of the whole company.
2635880	2637320	If only Congress would do that.
2637320	2638320	I know, right?
2638320	2639320	But I mean...
2639320	2645360	So now, in the scope of a week, we've gone from kicking Nintendo, fuck you Nintendo,
2645360	2649920	Operation Rainfall for life, fuck you, I hate you, to, oh my god, Congress needs to look
2649920	2652800	at what Nintendo's doing.
2652800	2654440	This all happened in a week!
2654440	2655680	I know.
2655680	2660400	Honestly, every politician needs to take a look at what Nintendo's doing.
2660400	2663240	Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.
2663240	2670200	Before we start talking about what Congress needs to start emulating from Nintendo, we're
2670200	2676040	still not over the fact that they botched all this stuff up with the Wii and all the
2676040	2679240	online and not bringing games over and whatnot.
2679240	2680880	But this is a very effective diversion.
2680880	2682920	Let me put it this way, okay?
2682920	2692480	Sony, they made a multi-million dollar error, if you will, in their online security, and
2692480	2694720	I got two games for it.
2694720	2698760	Nintendo, to make up for dropping- You got four games, you know you work the system,
2698760	2702480	just like the rest of us did with the multi-accounts.
2702480	2705800	To be fair, you got two PS3 games, two PSP games-
2705800	2711840	I did not actually do it on my other- Alright, well, whatever, it doesn't matter.
2711840	2717120	Um, and then, you know, we get- Okay, four games, fine.
2717120	2720560	Whereas Nintendo, oh, we're making up for dropping the console price.
2720560	2724620	Something that, you know, we knew was gonna happen, granted, it's a little bit earlier
2724620	2725620	than expected.
2725620	2726620	Who cares?
2726620	2729120	You know, if you've already bought it, whatever.
2729120	2734400	Um, so, you know, they're gonna give me twenty dollars, or twenty free games.
2734400	2738660	Now here's the best part, if you really want to game the system, here's what you do.
2738660	2745520	You go to, you know, a Best Buy, or a Walmart, or something like that, just before August
2745520	2746520	12th.
2746520	2751440	You buy a system for the full price, you log it onto Nintendo's network, and then when
2751440	2755480	it drops the price two days later, you come in and go, what the hell?
2755480	2756560	Why this drop in price?
2756560	2758480	I want a, you know, refund.
2758480	2761260	And they will refund you the difference in price.
2761260	2765240	If these companies are smart, which I'm not saying they are, but if they're smart, they're
2765240	2769920	gonna put an exemption to their policy, like just a couple weeks before.
2769920	2770920	Watch.
2770920	2772800	At least one of these stores is gonna do that.
2772800	2776680	They're gonna say, 3DS accepted from the policy from X to Y day.
2776680	2780760	They're gonna wait till right that first day that the refund, you know, if it's like a
2780760	2784320	twenty one day window, they'll wait till, well I guess we would be in that window, but,
2784320	2787320	you know, I don't know what the windows are, depending on what store you shop at, but I
2787320	2789960	bet some of them are gonna throw up an exception.
2789960	2794680	Maybe not something as huge as Walmart, but I bet you some of these other stores will.
2794680	2799160	You'll probably get, well at the very least, you know, if those games are interesting to
2799160	2801200	you, I mean, you can give it a shot.
2801200	2806160	I mean, I think that most of the time, if you're gonna, you know, you just play ignorant,
2806160	2811000	I guess, and, you know, cause not everybody's up reading gaming news and stuff like that.
2811000	2814040	You know, the moms and stuff like that, they aren't reading that, but then they hear about
2814040	2815800	an eighty dollar price drop, and they're like, what the hell?
2815800	2817440	I just spent the money.
2817440	2820000	Of course, you know.
2820000	2823320	Of course, we know that, but.
2823320	2828880	So Loki, you, okay, Loki, sometimes your thoughts on Nintendo really confuse the hell out of
2828880	2835600	me because you imported a 3DS from Japan just so you could have it before anybody else,
2835600	2840200	and you know, you were an early adopter of Nintendo, and I know you were an early adopter
2840200	2843440	of Wii as well, but then Nintendo does things that really piss you off, and you've screamed
2843440	2848000	and you've yelled at them here on the show, so surely you must have seen the news this
2848000	2849720	week and gone, what is this?
2849720	2850720	What is going on?
2850720	2853440	What is your reaction to all the news this week, and where are you at now?
2853440	2856080	My reaction is like, wow, I'm surprised they're dropping it this early.
2856080	2860680	I'm like, I guess that's an admission that, you know, it's not selling well, which we
2860680	2864760	all knew, and then, you know, wasn't angry about it.
2864760	2868680	You know, the only thing about these twenty free games is that, you know, it's kind of
2868680	2869680	cool.
2869680	2872480	At least I'll have something that I can put on my memory card that I can play, cause I'm
2872480	2876360	not, I'm not fucking buying any of those virtual console games.
2876360	2880500	I'm not paying money for that kind of stuff, hell no.
2880500	2884720	So that's kind of cool that I'll have something to fill up my memory card with, but at the
2884720	2889000	same time, you know, dropping the price of the system doesn't make any of the good games
2889000	2895200	come out any sooner, I mean, cause, you know, what, they announced a couple games, you know,
2895200	2901520	out this year, a new Mario, a Mario Kart, and stuff like that, but, I mean, I've seen
2901520	2905880	the videos of Mario Kart, and I was just kind of, eh, they added hang gliders and underwater,
2905880	2907560	big fucking deal.
2907560	2913280	You know, it's not that exciting, so, you know, I, it, I'll have something to download
2913280	2917040	for free, but it's not gonna definitely, not gonna get me to buy more things, and it's
2917040	2920680	definitely not gonna get me to buy crappy games that are out there now.
2920680	2926640	So, I mean, I would just have, I'm glad I'll have it used to dust off my system, cause
2926640	2930240	I was looking at it as sitting on the coffee table, not being charged or anything, just
2930240	2933360	sitting there, I'm like, eh, well, I don't know.
2933360	2938280	Uh, go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrady.com, technist in our chatroom says, right, Nintendo
2938280	2942640	running America, that means they will just rehash the same laws and not make new ones.
2942640	2946600	Isn't that kind of what's happening now, like, nobody wants to do something different, that's,
2946600	2950240	that's where we're at right now, but anyway, sorry, didn't mean to, uh, get controversial.
2950240	2954560	So this is Pop in our chat, says, what I want to know is, will DSi XL get a price drop too
2954560	2955560	now?
2955560	2960320	Very interesting that that is completely absent, but I would think logically it has to, right,
2960320	2963560	cause isn't the DSi XL right now, $179?
2963560	2964560	I don't remember.
2964560	2967880	I thought they already dropped the price of that stuff, I know they did the regular DS.
2967880	2973940	But even, I mean, logically, if the 3DS is coming down that low, XL and the rest of them,
2973940	2978000	if they're not fading into obscurity altogether, are going to have to get some type of price
2978000	2984640	cut, like XL ought to come down to 129, if not less, but I don't know, there's also a
2984640	2987720	part of me that kind of thinks like, well, why wouldn't Nintendo just get rid of all
2987720	2992760	the old DSs altogether and say, buy a 3DS or get GTFO?
2992760	2995040	I mean, and could you really blame them for doing that?
2995040	3000040	I mean, you would still have the current inventory on shelves now, we'll get their prices slashed
3000040	3005220	to get it off the shelves and make room for more 3DSs, but, well, let's talk about the
3005220	3011160	other topic that kind of comes up with this story and that is how does the Vita play into
3011160	3012160	all of this?
3012160	3016480	Because obviously a lot of folks, when they heard that the price point of the Vita was
3016480	3022080	going to be $250 for the lowest model was like, uh oh, Nintendo's in trouble.
3022080	3027600	So a lot of people see what's going on right now as a direct response, not just to Nintendo's
3027600	3032120	not doing so hot right now with the 3DS, but the Vita is going to be the same price and
3032120	3034160	Nintendo foresees trouble if they don't do this now.
3034160	3037760	I think it's a good idea that they did it because of the Vita and also because right
3037760	3042720	now the Vita's launch lineup is looking about as good as Nintendo's 3DS launch lineup.
3042720	3044640	Thank you, that's where I'm coming from.
3044640	3048400	There's these, you know, and I'm reading things on the internet that are like, oh, Sony was
3048400	3052000	just, Sony was ready to give Nintendo rumble and stuff, and like, I'm not trying to hate
3052000	3055960	on the Vita, but I also don't see where it's in much better of a position right now.
3055960	3060240	All the announced titles that they've got coming out right now aren't that exciting.
3060240	3061240	Uncharted.
3061240	3063960	That's their one big, huge thing they got.
3063960	3069480	Yeah, the other ones, like, I couldn't give a crap about whatever the hell that game,
3069480	3074080	the puzzle game is where they're like really showing off the back touch stuff or, you know,
3074080	3081200	I don't need another fucking rehash of goddamn, you know, uh, was it, uh, well, Little Big
3081200	3082200	Planet for one.
3082200	3087840	I mean, yeah, great, you know, Little Big Planet's coming out, but it's just like, okay,
3087840	3090840	it's gonna do a few different things.
3090840	3092280	I just don't care.
3092280	3096560	Or their kart racing game, which for the life of me I can't remember the fuck it's called
3096560	3098680	right now, but I don't care.
3098680	3102640	Ooh, I can make mountains by putting my fingers in their, I don't care.
3102640	3104440	I just don't care.
3104440	3110280	So I don't know, it's, I just think, you know, and don't get me wrong.
3110280	3111280	I want a Vita.
3111280	3112680	I'm going to buy a Vita at launch.
3112680	3113680	I will.
3113680	3115800	I mean, I just, I, I'm a techno, techno person.
3115800	3120120	I have to have it all, but, uh, and there, there are a couple of games on Vita.
3120120	3124720	I do want, there was that one music game that Miklotov was talking about on one of the E3
3124720	3125720	specials that I want to get.
3125720	3128600	And then there's that dungeon game that there, that probably won't be out at launch, but
3128600	3130520	I know down the road, I'll want to get that.
3130520	3135120	Um, so there are things on Vita that I want, but I look at the holidays and I go, I still
3135120	3136640	think Nintendo is going to win.
3136640	3138520	I don't think the Vita is going to win the holidays.
3138520	3139920	I got Mario.
3139920	3143100	I know 3DS has the Mario games coming out.
3143100	3146360	Do not underestimate the power of the soccer mom.
3146360	3148380	What won Christmas five years ago?
3148380	3149400	The Wii.
3149400	3151080	What won Christmas last year?
3151080	3152080	The Kinect.
3152080	3154200	Who is the target audience of both of those?
3154200	3155580	Oprah watchers.
3155580	3158920	You know, it's, I think it's going to be the same story this year.
3158920	3163960	The performance from March to now isn't really going to matter when it comes to the holidays
3163960	3169640	and all the kids everywhere want the 3DS to play Mario and watch 3D movies on.
3169640	3172320	I mean, the 3DS kind of has a lot going for it.
3172320	3176320	And I got to think also that some people, well, a lot of people probably thought, Hey,
3176320	3177320	you know what?
3177320	3182480	Nintendo is probably going to drop the price of the 3DS before holiday because you know,
3182480	3184280	it's not doing that well.
3184280	3188440	Or I mean, even if it was doing all right, they still want to, you know, incentivize
3188440	3191000	people for, you know, buying the system.
3191000	3192680	I mean, I think a lot of people are like, well, you know what?
3192680	3194280	There's not a lot of good games out right now.
3194280	3196000	I'm just going to wait.
3196000	3199000	And waiting paid off for you.
3199000	3201320	I'm just saying, imagine you're a soccer mom.
3201320	3203440	Now, I know, I know.
3203440	3204440	Just hear me out here for a minute.
3204440	3208760	Imagine you're a soccer mom and you don't know anything about games, but you know, there's
3208760	3213760	this one system that's $250 that I guess does some type of back touch thing.
3213760	3220400	But then there's this other system over here that's $80 less and it does 3D Mario and it
3220400	3221400	has Mario on it.
3221400	3222400	Yeah.
3222400	3226760	Would you remember some of your friends liking when you were in junior high school?
3226760	3228720	Which is where the soccer moms are at now.
3228720	3229720	Right?
3229720	3230720	Yeah.
3230720	3234000	So I mean, like, when I'm not trying to, again, I'm not trying to knock the Vita.
3234000	3238360	I think it's going to be huge with the college crowd and the young twenties and you know,
3238360	3241320	more adult gamers, if you will, it'll still be huge with them.
3241320	3243960	And the fact that it's a, you know, all in one in the pocket.
3243960	3247960	But I think when it comes down to the actual sales, I think what shows up under those Christmas
3247960	3253480	trees and Hanukkah menorahs and so forth are going to be 3DSs.
3253480	3255440	Do you put your presence under the menorah?
3255440	3256800	We don't really do presence for Hanukkah.
3256800	3261000	I thought you were supposed to have eight crazy nights.
3261000	3264720	The whole presence thing started because of Christmas actually.
3264720	3268640	Cause little kids that my friends, my Gentile friends get presents.
3268640	3270840	I want presents too.
3270840	3273200	Usually it's like the back to school holiday.
3273200	3274600	You get pencils and paper.
3274600	3276520	So I don't have to get you a present heathen.
3276520	3277520	You can get me a present.
3277520	3280840	I get you a present.
3280840	3284160	I get you guys presents because I know that you celebrate Christmas.
3284160	3287980	Well, you know, I like presents because I'm greedy.
3287980	3288980	There you go.
3288980	3289980	And special.
3289980	3290980	There you go.
3290980	3295920	Uh, going to our chat room, uh, laha in the chat room says, I think the parents didn't
3295920	3297280	like the 3D.
3297280	3300000	Something about not wanting to mess up their kids' eyes.
3300000	3305440	Uh, but what about, okay, look at movies, dude, Smurfs 3D is like a top as a box office.
3305440	3307280	3D really bugs my eyes.
3307280	3309880	You know, I hate looking at the world in 3D.
3309880	3312080	It really hurts my eyes.
3312080	3313080	Actually I will tell you something.
3313080	3314920	I know what laha is referring to.
3314920	3320200	It's those studies about the kids' eyes and so forth, but honestly the 3DS itself is not
3320200	3321200	true 3D.
3321200	3325680	It's lenticular and that can cause some issues with, with vision.
3325680	3327280	I mean, it gives me a headache.
3327280	3330680	I can't play a 3DS for very long without getting a headache.
3330680	3335400	So the first day it gave me a headache, but now it's fine.
3335400	3337520	Ridge Racer was unplayable.
3337520	3338660	It was just completely unplayable.
3338660	3341800	I've actually been using the 3DS a little bit as a Netflix device.
3341800	3344800	Like it's kind of nice to just have it like, you know, when you're like lying in bed, but
3344800	3346260	you're not really ready to go to sleep.
3346260	3350000	Like it's kind of nice to just be able to, you know, have the thing there to watch Netflix.
3350000	3351000	Yeah.
3351000	3355400	And funny enough, I have an iPhone, which I could use, but I don't know, usually that's
3355400	3356400	on the charger.
3356400	3358280	But the 3DS just kind of works.
3358280	3359280	Yeah.
3359280	3361720	You know, I guess they do have a point with the 3D thing.
3361720	3364360	I mean, that's really gonna torpedo their sales.
3364360	3368960	If only they had the forethought to, you know, put in a slider or something to turn the 3D
3368960	3369960	off.
3369960	3370960	If only.
3370960	3374200	Sorry Nintendo, maybe next time.
3374200	3376320	All right.
3376320	3380680	And Tigerclaw and Chad is correcting me saying Smurfs and Cowboy and Aliens are sharing the
3380680	3382600	number one spot this week.
3382600	3387040	But the reason why the Smurfs is even tied in the first place is that it's, it's has
3387040	3391560	those extra 3D ticket sales because let's face it, no one over the age of 11 wanted
3391560	3393080	to see the Smurfs movie.
3393080	3395020	I still want to see Cowboys and Aliens.
3395020	3400520	I'm very torn about the Smurfs movie because I really like Neil Patrick Harris, but I really
3400520	3402520	hate everything else about that movie.
3402520	3408360	I love Hank Azaria and he's Gargamel, but I am not fucking sitting through that movie.
3408360	3409360	I'm sorry.
3409360	3411620	He does, however, look just like freaking Gargamel, doesn't he?
3411620	3412620	I will give you that.
3412620	3414560	Why are we talking about the Smurfs movie?
3414560	3417800	Because we're talking about sales and 3D and shit.
3417800	3418800	But you know what though?
3418800	3423160	The Muppets movie, there's a lot of the cast from, uh, you know, How I Met Your Mother.
3423160	3424160	Fuck yes to the Muppets movie.
3424160	3426640	And I can't wait.
3426640	3427640	That's going to be me.
3427640	3428880	A hundred percent yes to the Muppets movie.
3428880	3431280	A hundred percent no to the Smurfs movie.
3431280	3432280	Smurfs is terrible.
3432280	3433280	All right.
3433280	3434280	You know what else is terrible?
3434280	3435280	What?
3435280	3436280	Since we're on this tangent train.
3436280	3437280	Okay.
3437280	3438280	Battleship.
3438280	3439280	What the fuck is that?
3439280	3440280	Oh my God.
3440280	3442280	Oh my God.
3442280	3444400	That movie looks a special kind of terrible.
3444400	3448520	I saw that you posted the trailer on the Facebook and I think my comment was quote, this looks
3448520	3449520	like shit.
3449520	3452480	No, Dan showed it to me and my reply was what?
3452480	3454360	I'm like, I'm sorry.
3454360	3458860	Last time I played Battleship, I didn't, I mean, and the way the trailer looked like
3458860	3463240	with the configuration of the ships, I was literally expecting Leah Neeson to shout out
3463240	3469640	I seven and Rhianna to go, girl, you shot my battleship.
3469640	3470760	That's what they're setting up.
3470760	3473520	It's just like, well, our radar's out.
3473520	3478200	We have this satellite imagery that we're going to use to plot where we fire stuff and
3478200	3483320	the enemies, you know, the whatever their missiles or whatever, but the pegs, they spent
3483320	3487520	money, lots and lots of money on that movie.
3487520	3491780	And what really freaks me out is that they bought the rights to all these other board
3491780	3492780	games too.
3492780	3498000	They want to do a new clue movie and I'm like, oh my God, no, no, no, no.
3498000	3500680	The one in the eighties was perfect.
3500680	3502520	It's a cult classic.
3502520	3508000	It's Tim Curry at his finest, second finest next to Ferder, third finest next to Ferder
3508000	3514440	and Pennywise and fourth finest next to Ferder, Pennywise and whatever in Annie.
3514440	3515440	What?
3515440	3516440	Oh, what about the demon in Labyrinth?
3516440	3517440	God damn it.
3517440	3518440	Okay.
3518440	3519440	Fifth finest.
3519440	3520440	Let's just face it.
3520440	3521440	Tim Curry is always awesome.
3521440	3522440	Every movie he touches is amazing.
3522440	3523440	Even in the worst witch, he was awesome.
3523440	3527920	So like, don't make clue like battleship.
3527920	3530000	I will cry.
3530000	3535160	Like I just expect this scene of Ms. Peacock walking these little squares in the, like,
3535160	3536160	oh my God.
3536160	3537160	Okay.
3537160	3541580	And then all of a sudden aliens come from outer space and you know, says you suck my
3541580	3546840	battleship and uh, you sunk my battleship.
3546840	3547840	Yeah.
3547840	3553680	Ism said you sunk my box office sales and Frisbee says you sunk my PT boat.
3553680	3554680	Uh, yeah.
3554680	3555680	Oh, Yahtzee movie.
3555680	3556680	Good idea.
3556680	3557680	Strelok.
3557680	3558680	Okay.
3558680	3560720	Tiger Claw and chat says, you know, despite what you see in the trailer, it could be a
3560720	3564560	fun popcorn movie if you ignore the fact it's based on a board game.
3564560	3572080	Go watch the trailer again and then come back and tell me that because maybe getting high
3572080	3575760	will be fun, but not like the first half of that trailer.
3575760	3576760	Don't get me wrong.
3576760	3581440	This is like a really cheesy, you know, this guy's like, you know, he's a loose cannon,
3581440	3584920	but he's going to, you know, this battleship thing and then they're like, Hey, what's that
3584920	3585920	out there?
3585920	3586920	You know, what is that?
3586920	3587920	You know, I thought, Oh, okay.
3587920	3590560	Maybe it's another boat that they're doing that, you know, it's kinda like Top Gun where
3590560	3595640	they're doing exercises and then, you know, Oh, they have to, you know, combat, you know,
3595640	3596640	the enemy and stuff like that.
3596640	3604040	But then it was an alien and I'm like, okay, I can't follow this at all anymore.
3604040	3608920	I just didn't really have the right, uh, stir lock and chat says monopoly movie.
3608920	3609920	God damn.
3609920	3610920	Do they have the rights to monopoly?
3610920	3611920	Oh my God.
3611920	3615800	Why do I just, I just picture this trailer in my mind and I don't know monopoly.
3615800	3620880	I just picture Russell Brand is sitting in a top hat and a monocle going, Oh God, get
3620880	3621880	out of jail.
3621880	3628240	Free called, uh, monopoly, uh, Ouija, they're doing a new Ouija, uh, movie.
3628240	3633460	Uh, is it going to be like, Oh, what was the best Ouija movie ever?
3633460	3639960	The, The Exorcist, seriously, that, that how about which board was based off of a week
3639960	3640960	off a Ouija board.
3640960	3641960	How about which board?
3641960	3642960	Anyhow.
3642960	3643960	All right.
3643960	3647600	I don't want to talk about these horrible movies anymore, although it is, it is related
3647600	3648600	to games.
3648600	3650840	Every single one of these movies will have a game tie into it.
3650840	3651920	You better believe it.
3651920	3655640	So there will be something on the Wii that you can get for the battleship movie.
3655640	3661600	That'll be, you know, Liam Neeson yelling, I seven, I do, by the way, have to quote something
3661600	3667280	from Tumblr if you watch, um, The Exorcist backwards, it's about a girl who's really
3667280	3670560	sick and then eat some pea soup and gets better.
3670560	3671560	Shut up.
3671560	3677760	I, uh, uh, I'll bring it up later, but I'm trying to find that list of movies that they
3677760	3678760	have.
3678760	3682560	Maybe we'll save it for like the afterbirth or something, but it's terrible.
3682560	3683560	I know.
3683560	3684560	All right.
3684560	3687920	Can we move on?
3687920	3690880	Let's talk about other three DS related news real quick.
3690880	3694320	I think you already know about this, but I've got to just jump in here and say this.
3694320	3699360	Uh, there are new three DS games coming this holiday season, namely Mario Kart, three DS
3699360	3700600	and super Mario three DS.
3700600	3704680	It's apparently has a name now, the Mario game, which was just kind of snuck in there.
3704680	3708240	That was the other weird thing about this week and the Nintendo, like all this other
3708240	3711440	news that just kind of showed up in the press releases.
3711440	3716000	Like the fact that original NES games were coming to virtual console, that just was kind
3716000	3717000	of, Oh yeah.
3717000	3719040	Well, since we're giving them away, we're just going to throw that out there.
3719040	3721160	I have to point out something to LAHA.
3721160	3723380	There was a dungeon and dragons movie.
3723380	3724480	It was pretty bad.
3724480	3725760	Tom Baker was in it.
3725760	3729800	However, yeah, the kid from cereal mom was in it.
3729800	3733480	There was a sequel by the way.
3733480	3741240	And just to, um, let you know the movie crawl that came out when I was pretty young, I saw
3741240	3742240	it in the theater.
3742240	3746080	I'll put it that way was supposed to be the dungeon and dragons movie and they lost the
3746080	3747640	license for it.
3747640	3752640	So dungeons and dragons has been done for the record though.
3752640	3755480	I did kind of like the dungeon and dragons and dragons and dragons.
3755480	3758720	You will believe that a Wayans can be an elf.
3758720	3759720	He wasn't enough.
3759720	3760720	What was he?
3760720	3761720	He played a human.
3761720	3763040	I thought he was a human thief.
3763040	3764040	Really?
3764040	3765040	Tom Baker played an elf.
3765040	3769640	Oh, he played the king of the elves and Tom Baker is awesome because he was the fourth
3769640	3770640	doctor.
3770640	3771640	So shut up everybody.
3771640	3777520	Anyway, Mario Kart seven as it's being called right now, it will be out in December and
3777520	3781560	Super Mario 3D land will be out in November.
3781560	3787080	No further information still on Kid Icarus, which is also supposed to be this holiday,
3787080	3789160	but they haven't exactly said when that is.
3789160	3792080	And now there's a little bit of concern that maybe it's not going to make this year.
3792080	3796040	You know the best part about Mario Kart seven according to Kotaku, it's actually the ninth
3796040	3798440	Mario Kart game.
3798440	3799440	Is it really?
3799440	3800440	Yes it is.
3800440	3801560	What games did they forget?
3801560	3802560	Arcade ones.
3802560	3806680	Uh, well I think it's Nintendo didn't really develop the arcade ones.
3806680	3810040	Didn't Namco do those because that's why it's still Mario Kart.
3810040	3812560	There was a Pac-Man movie by the way, but it was animated.
3812560	3814400	They would not be considered canon.
3814400	3818800	I would support calling it Mario Kart seven because the arcade ones are not canon.
3818800	3820880	They're not as good either.
3820880	3826000	They're really not like they're okay for arcade games I guess, but they're not the same quality
3826000	3827360	as the home ones.
3827360	3831840	And unlike Loki, I love me some Mario Kart and I am looking forward to this new one.
3831840	3836920	As long as it's not double dash bad, then I am looking forward to the new one.
3836920	3840200	I did actually have to point out that just about everything that Laha suggested, there
3840200	3842380	actually have been movies.
3842380	3843380	There was a Pac-Man movie.
3843380	3844380	It was animated.
3844380	3846800	There was a Pac-Man TV show back in the day.
3846800	3847800	Yes there was.
3847800	3848800	It was the same series.
3848800	3849800	The movie was in the same series.
3849800	3853440	There's also Pac-Man save Santa Claus.
3853440	3854960	Hey I watched it.
3854960	3857480	You know what my two shows were when I was a kid?
3857480	3859060	It was Pac-Man and Qbert.
3859060	3861920	I watched the Qbert cartoon too.
3861920	3862920	Alright let's move on.
3862920	3864440	Half the Line gagged me with a rocket ship.
3864440	3869420	Candyland was also one of the other licenses that they had.
3869420	3871800	It was Monopoly Battleship Candyland and Ouija.
3871800	3872800	Great.
3872800	3879720	I hope Patrick Stewart stars in Candyland.
3879720	3881960	Set course for Yellow Square.
3881960	3882960	Engage.
3882960	3886680	Spock is not impressed.
3886680	3890040	So did they get Chutes and Ladders too?
3890040	3891040	Alright.
3891040	3892440	Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?
3892440	3893440	How about Hi Ho Cheerio?
3893440	3894440	Okay.
3894440	3895560	How about a story?
3895560	3896760	This is stupid.
3896760	3899000	And I'm gonna say why it's stupid after I read it.
3899000	3904640	Basically the ESA wants 1.1 million dollars of reimbursement from the state of California
3904640	3907360	for the law that failed.
3907360	3910200	Basically it's for Brown versus EMA.
3910200	3916420	And basically the whole point is that, and this is a quote, California persisted in defending
3916420	3921060	a law that plaintiffs warned of the legislature was unconstitutional before it passed.
3921060	3925240	That was previously found to be unconstitutional by the district court and a unanimous panel
3925240	3930400	of the 9th circuit and that is similar to at least 8 other laws invalidated as unconstitutional
3930400	3935080	prior to the time California sought seriatory in this case.
3935080	3940320	So basically, like, you knew, but you pursued it anyway because you're stupid?
3940320	3941320	Pay us.
3941320	3943400	We spent a lot of money beating your ass.
3943400	3945640	Pay us.
3945640	3955480	Now California did send, um, a check for $282,794 for reimbursement for legal fees.
3955480	3962440	However, um, we're broke in California.
3962440	3963640	That's kind of where I'm at.
3963640	3969320	I'm like, I'm like, yeah, ESA kind of deserves it, but at the same time we don't have the
3969320	3970500	money right now.
3970500	3971720	So you just need to...
3971720	3973680	I'm going to tell you what's going to happen, ESA.
3973680	3975600	Listen to me, representatives of the ESA.
3975600	3978320	This is what's going to happen if you get your money.
3978320	3982280	They're going to find another tax to raise or increase our tuition again or do something
3982280	3989600	else and it's going to hurt the people you're trying to, that pretty much fund your operation.
3989600	3992920	This is so hard because I can see it from both sides, but from the ESA, the ESA spent
3992920	3997720	a lot of money defending something that should have never been sent a law in the first place.
3997720	3999680	They were defending our rights.
3999680	4002720	And so it's kind of like they, they should be entitled to that money.
4002720	4004240	But I, I am with you.
4004240	4009000	I know damn well that money is not going to come out of thin air and there's so much...
4009000	4010000	It doesn't need to come out of thin air.
4010000	4014960	It needs to come out of fucking Lila Nee's ass is where it needs to fucking come from.
4014960	4017040	That's I think that's where the money should come from.
4017040	4018040	Absolutely.
4018040	4020120	They need to take it right from the source.
4020120	4026080	I honestly think that any of these politicians that have basically brought up anything like
4026080	4030080	this that have failed, that spent our taxpayer dollars, cause you know, he didn't pay anything
4030080	4032840	out of pocket for any of this shit.
4032840	4037380	Anything that comes out of our pockets as taxpayers, the ones responsible for the failed
4037380	4040320	law need to pay and pay it themselves.
4040320	4042520	He want to put his name on it for all the fucking fame.
4042520	4043760	Well, you know what?
4043760	4047680	You put your name on that shit and now you need to pay for it because you know, what
4047680	4051840	kind of reprimand is he going to get for coming up with this law?
4051840	4053040	Obviously he didn't fucking learn anything.
4053040	4055160	He's like, well, I'm going to just try it again.
4055160	4057660	You know, it's like, you know, Well, you know what?
4057660	4062880	This is actually some something, cause you know, here in California, basically we are
4062880	4065800	pretty much a direct democracy here.
4065800	4068440	We can vote on what we want.
4068440	4072200	All you have to do is have enough signatures to put it on the ballot and it can be voted
4072200	4073360	on.
4073360	4079140	And this is something that I would seriously sit back and pen a potential, and I've got
4079140	4083320	friends that will, you know, will review the legal side of it for me for free.
4083320	4088280	This is something that I would sit back and pen myself that a politician needs to be responsible
4088280	4090320	for anything they do that fails.
4090320	4094520	You know, if they cost the taxpayer money on a failed venture, then it needs to come
4094520	4096840	out of their personal pocket or they need to have them cut and pay.
4096840	4102320	I don't want to get too political, but I could see, but you wouldn't want to scare off a
4102320	4105560	politician from doing something that maybe they really should be doing.
4105560	4108400	You know, there's got, there's, there's a middle ground somewhere.
4108400	4112420	I know, but there, and you're right, but we got, you have to be very careful in how you
4112420	4117680	word something like that is that the court should be able to find the person liable when
4117680	4119320	gross negligence is shown.
4119320	4124760	There needs to be something that the judge could do it, but not like you wouldn't want
4124760	4130980	all politicians to have to suffer because of people constantly going after rights and
4130980	4131980	things like that.
4131980	4135520	But I mean, but I mean, it would have to be on a case by case basis, but I'm saying in
4135520	4142640	particular or something like this, and this is why I honestly don't, don't get me started.
4142640	4146960	I have a big problem with politicians in general, except for, you know, the ones that are pretty
4146960	4151260	much putting out their own money for stuff that needs to be done because they're still
4151260	4152560	out there.
4152560	4157060	But this, and again, we're broke in California.
4157060	4162600	We have no money, even though we have some of the highest grossing, you know, income
4162600	4169540	people in the country that live in our state, are they being taxed any more, you know, relatively
4169540	4171360	any more than we are?
4171360	4174320	No, because of Republicans.
4174320	4179280	Anyway, but I'm saying that when you come to the point that we don't have any more money
4179280	4183840	to pay on any of this and they're still going and pursuing stuff that they know is going
4183840	4189640	to cost us money, what's the point?
4189640	4191060	And when is that going to stop?
4191060	4192240	They're going to keep doing stupid shit.
4192240	4195880	Just look at all the, look at all the dumb laws they have in San Francisco.
4195880	4196880	Seriously.
4196880	4197880	Yeah.
4197880	4199920	And they were going to try to ban circumcision.
4199920	4203000	The whole circumcision thing that went on the ballot and had to be thrown out.
4203000	4206440	I think it was thrown out by a judge that it's not going to be on the ballot because,
4206440	4209440	you know, it was just too ridiculous or whatever legal thing they decided.
4209440	4213800	And besides that, it is, it would infringe on religious rights, so.
4213800	4214800	Right.
4214800	4218160	But I mean, it's just so- But it's like, who paid for that?
4218160	4219800	Who paid for that whole process?
4219800	4223520	They pay, the reason why I think it's so expensive to live in San Francisco is because they have
4223520	4227080	a bunch of ridiculous laws that aren't necessary.
4227080	4228960	None of us elsewhere have to deal with it.
4228960	4231000	Just in San Francisco, they have this shit.
4231000	4236080	But I mean, I don't want to get too political here, but some could look and say, in San
4236080	4237720	Francisco, everyone has health care.
4237720	4238720	We'll see.
4238720	4239720	Okay.
4239720	4240720	That's one I agree with.
4240720	4245320	But I'm saying there's other- Anyhow, all right.
4245320	4246880	We got to, we got to not.
4246880	4250400	I think Jamie needs a spinoff show that's political.
4250400	4252480	No cause then I would be harsh and have a headache.
4252480	4253480	Called Stitchin' Bitch.
4253480	4254480	All right.
4254480	4255480	Let's move on.
4255480	4258040	Uh, Loki, what do you have for us?
4258040	4259040	Back to gaming.
4259040	4264480	Uh, GameStop is now prepared to offer downloadable PC purchases at retail, much like they do
4264480	4272360	right now with digital purchases for DLC and stuff like that.
4272360	4275320	I mean, great if you want to do that.
4275320	4279640	I mean, if you're trading used items for, like, download content or something like that.
4279640	4285920	But I mean, much like I don't see the point in download content being purchased at retail,
4285920	4289960	I don't really see the point of buying a digital PC title at retail.
4289960	4296000	I mean, shit, if you're going to go to retail to buy a digital title, like, say, you know,
4296000	4299840	any game that's out there now that, you know, it's like a major game, like, say like a Deus
4299840	4303720	Ex, Human Revolution, or something like that, just buy the boxed copy.
4303720	4307840	I mean, if you're going to fucking pay money for it at retail anyways, why are you going
4307840	4310640	to pay money for a code to go download it for digitally?
4310640	4311640	I mean, it's just...
4311640	4315920	I think GameCroc's just trying to do what they have to do to stay relevant, but it ain't
4315920	4316920	going to work.
4316920	4317920	Period.
4317920	4322160	Yeah, I mean, they're saying that, like, for example, uh, the first game, yeah, actually,
4322160	4326680	Deus Ex is the first game that'll be an in-store digital purchase, says those who purchase
4326680	4330920	the digital versions will also receive downloads for the original Deus Ex Game of the Year
4330920	4333040	edition and Deus Ex Invisible War.
4333040	4335800	So that's kind of how you get a little bit of extra stuff.
4335800	4340920	Customers will also receive explosive mission DLC and double power-up rewards points.
4340920	4345320	I mean, I guess that's cool if you want all those extras.
4345320	4349040	I mean, I know Steam does a lot of, like, extras like that as well.
4349040	4355240	I guess it's just really, you know, if that's important to you, then I'd go that route.
4355240	4360960	But if you're just looking to buy, you know, digital stuff, I mean, it's kind of like the
4360960	4364160	whole point of buying digital in the first place is so you don't have to go to the store.
4364160	4366800	But I guess if you're young enough and you don't have a credit card or something like
4366800	4369840	that, then that may be the only way to go.
4369840	4372640	But I still think it's ridiculous.
4372640	4374640	But whatever, you know.
4374640	4376280	It's what they want to do.
4376280	4378560	Power to the players, as they say.
4378560	4383320	It'd be really neat if I could, like, get into the used game market with this stuff.
4383320	4387960	Like, I should be able to, like, Steam, revoke my access to a game and I get, like, a credit
4387960	4392240	to use on the store and then somebody else can buy the game at a reduced price or something.
4392240	4396960	I know that'll never happen, but if you think about it, they could do something where the
4396960	4398440	publisher would get a cut of that.
4398440	4401580	And that doesn't happen right now in the retail stores.
4401580	4406260	There could be a way, if publishers are smarter about the used game market, where they could
4406260	4409000	get a cut of it.
4409000	4414080	And I'm not just talking these $10 online passes, but whatever.
4414080	4420080	Anyhow, moving on, speaking of prices, Xbox Live Arcade.
4420080	4422800	Have you noticed something about the games on Xbox Live Arcade?
4422800	4425840	Yeah, the points have been slowly rising.
4425840	4430040	That's right, the cost of the games have been rising on Xbox Live.
4430040	4434840	So far, in 2011, there have been 20 1200-plus games.
4434840	4440060	Last year, 27 of the 85 games released for the service cost 1200 points or more.
4440060	4442640	So we're already at 20 for this year.
4442640	4449360	So that was an 8% increase in itself over 2009, when 21 titles hit that price point.
4449360	4454520	Now they are saying that, well, we have to blame the fact that the quality of games we're
4454520	4457160	basically making is a lot higher too.
4457160	4462040	Limbo and Castle Crashers, they're as good as anything else that's out on the market.
4462040	4463040	What do you guys think?
4463040	4466880	Do you think that Xbox Live Arcade games are getting better and therefore they're worth
4466880	4473520	the extra money, or do you think this is just inflation when we're not paying attention?
4473520	4477240	I think it's inflation.
4477240	4479080	I think it's a little bit of a mix of both.
4479080	4482520	I think, yes, it's inflation going on, but at the same time, you really don't see anymore
4482520	4485220	like just crappy, lazy arcade ports.
4485220	4491120	Ever since Microsoft banned those from the service, you don't see any more of this just
4491120	4495760	re-release of an old-ass game that's 400 Microsoft points.
4495760	4499760	Most of the stuff that's coming out now definitely had a lot of development dollars put into
4499760	4502000	it with mixed success.
4502000	4503000	Some of it's really good.
4503000	4504000	Some of it's not so good.
4504000	4506520	It just depends on what kind of games you're into.
4506520	4508000	I think it's a little bit of both.
4508000	4509000	And you know what?
4509000	4510000	That's fine.
4510000	4516120	They want to put out $20 games because you don't have to buy them, and no one's forcing
4516120	4517120	you to buy them.
4517120	4518120	And you know what?
4518120	4522040	If you're smart, you wait, and then sometimes when that game pops up onto the deal of the
4522040	4523840	week, then you buy it for a cheaper price.
4523840	4524840	And I still do.
4524840	4528600	I will say one thing I do love is that you still get the demos, and that's something
4528600	4531720	you can't always get at a retail store.
4531720	4533840	So that is one thing I really like.
4533840	4537560	And I can really, really try a game before I buy it.
4537560	4541960	So Xbox Live Arcade, even though the prices are creeping up, as long as the quality stays
4541960	4546340	good, I mean, there's been a lot of good arcade games I've played lately, I guess it's okay.
4546340	4547340	So we'll see.
4547340	4548340	Dar Sakura.
4548340	4551840	Well, in other news, this actually is for our UK listeners.
4551840	4556480	The shop game restarted its Play Now, Trade Later deal.
4556480	4562920	So basically, you can buy a game and trade it in at a guaranteed amount, so you essentially
4562920	4567120	end up paying 5 pounds for your game.
4567120	4574280	And the games that are included on this list is UFC Trainer for Wii, Cars 2 on DS, Art
4574280	4578800	Academy, Calaveras the Cartel, Hunted, The Demon's Forge, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows
4578800	4580640	Part 2 for Wii.
4580640	4584880	So it's a number of games, you'd have to check with your local game store to find out.
4584880	4589640	But this is going, basically if you trade in any of those games for credit before August
4589640	4593040	12th, they'll effectively cost 5 pounds.
4593040	4596000	You can use the credit on any future purchase.
4596000	4601200	So that's pretty good, I mean, it's a good way to save money, especially if these are
4601200	4603600	games that you got and you're kind of like, eh, meh.
4603600	4608360	Sounds like a really weird way of doing like a demo or like a rental service.
4608360	4613640	Well, in February, they also had one where it guaranteed a 35 pound trade in for shooters
4613640	4616440	like Killzone 3 and Bulletstorm.
4616440	4619960	So it's a good way to basically revolt stock.
4619960	4620960	So.
4620960	4621960	Hmm.
4621960	4624200	Well, we'll see how successful this is.
4624200	4627080	I don't know, none of those games are making me go, ooh, gotta get it.
4627080	4630800	I mean, granted, I live in the wrong country anyway, but we'll see.
4630800	4632400	Well, good luck.
4632400	4636920	Alright, well, let's travel the world and talk about release dates and what upcoming
4636920	4642640	games you could maybe get a 5 pound deal or a 5 dollar deal on later.
4642640	4649680	Well, not a whole lot this week, and at least there's some games coming up this week, because
4649680	4653840	there's a few weeks coming up here where there's nothing.
4653840	4656680	Starting off, Phineas and Ferb, Across the Second Dimension.
4656680	4658680	I love Phineas and Ferb.
4658680	4661320	It's coming out on PlayStation 3 with move support.
4661320	4663040	How much is it?
4663040	4666000	We, I believe, 40 dollars.
4666000	4668560	Do you love Phineas and Ferb, 40 dollars much?
4668560	4670960	No, I'll just keep watching episodes off the internet.
4670960	4671960	There you go.
4671960	4674040	Well, it's not a bad game, actually.
4674040	4678040	It's done by the people who did Ratchet and Clank, so, you know, if you like Ratchet and
4678040	4681240	Clank, then it might be worth picking up.
4681240	4686520	So yeah, Phineas and Ferb, yeah, 40 dollars retail on PlayStation 3, Wii, and the DS.
4686520	4692120	Well, DS, of course, is 30, not 40, that'd be ridiculous.
4692120	4697400	Sesame Street, Ready Set Grover coming out on the DS and the Wii, DS version has a funny
4697400	4698400	little Grover stylus.
4698400	4702240	Aw, bummer, I thought it might be that Kinect game that they were showing at E3.
4702240	4704280	No, no, that got delayed.
4704280	4710480	Sesame, on the Wii version, you get a Grover fuzzy Wii remote cover.
4710480	4714480	Wait, wait, you said that really quick, that got delayed?
4714480	4715960	Delayed to when, next year?
4715960	4718840	No, just in the fall.
4718840	4719840	Like October.
4719840	4723560	Oh, I guess, I thought that was when it was always set to come out.
4723560	4726720	Mmm, it was August at one point.
4726720	4736160	But anyways, um, and then of course, let's see here, is that really it?
4736160	4742160	Oh yeah, I forgot, Saints Row Special Edition 2-pack, they're basically re-releasing the
4742160	4745480	Saints Row double pack that they had a while ago where you can get one and two, but this
4745480	4750920	also gives you early access to the Initiation Station demo that they're gonna be having
4750920	4753040	coming out later on.
4753040	4759240	Bleach Soul Resurrection for the Playstation 3, this is gonna be kind of like a Dice Warrior
4759240	4766000	type of game, also you get three free episodes, or the anime episodes on Playstation Network
4766000	4769240	with that, you get a voucher for that, it's kinda cool.
4769240	4778160	Sniper Ghost Warrior Extended Edition, that's coming out on 360, and that's it.
4778160	4783360	I love the enthusiasm in the chatroom shown by Sturlok at chat.hornslaunchradio.com.
4783360	4790040	Sturlok says, yay Grover, he was my favorite when I was a kid, him and Cookie Monster.
4790040	4796600	Back in my day, Elmo didn't exist on the old school Sesame Street back when I was a kid.
4796600	4799000	Which we like to refer to as the good old days.
4799000	4800160	That's right.
4800160	4804360	Brakeman says, I preferred the Muppets, I liked Muppet Babies, but it was always about
4804360	4805360	Fraggle Rock.
4805360	4807120	I don't know about you guys, but anyhow.
4807120	4808320	Fraggle Rock is awesome.
4808320	4812440	Alright, going to Japanese release dates, it's kind of a slow week over there as well,
4812440	4815800	but on the Xbox 360 this week you get a couple of price reductions, including Assassin's
4815800	4820560	Creed Brotherhood Special Edition and Tropico 3 both move into the Platinum Collection,
4820560	4823400	that's on the 4th of August on the Xbox 360.
4823400	4828600	Going over to the Playstation 3, we have Assassin's Creed Brotherhood there as well, and then
4828600	4834080	another game getting a price reduction, this has a whopper of a name, it's R. Tonelico
4834080	4841360	3, Sekai Shun no Hikigane wa Shujo no Utagahajuku gets a price reduction this week.
4841360	4842860	I have no idea what game this is.
4842860	4843860	This looks like...
4843860	4845520	It's R. Tonelico.
4845520	4848720	It's a role playing game, and of course it looks like you can dress the little girls
4848720	4854840	up as bunnies in the game, and I can see a little item shop in some of these pictures.
4854840	4856920	The game looks kind of cool, but I don't think we have this here.
4856920	4857920	Yeah we do.
4857920	4860040	Not number 3 I don't think, we have number 2 at least.
4860040	4861040	What game is this?
4861040	4862040	It's R. Tonelico.
4862040	4863040	Oh.
4863040	4864040	I didn't know that was out here.
4864040	4865040	Yeah, it's out here.
4865040	4866040	Oh, there you go.
4866040	4868040	It looks interesting, maybe I'll check it out.
4868040	4873120	Alright, let's see, moving on to other consoles, I don't know if Nintendo has anything on their
4873120	4879320	lineup that I will check, but I can't do the PSP, we do have a couple games there.
4879320	4886560	We have Storm Lover, Summer Love from D3, Toriyoko, Gourmet Survival, what is that, like
4886560	4888560	Iron Chef or Die?
4888560	4889560	Gourmet Survival!
4889560	4893320	No, it doesn't look like it has anything to do with cooking.
4893320	4897080	It does look like some type of like you're fighting dinosaurs and gorillas, like you
4897080	4898920	take on primates.
4898920	4905480	Like look at that, this dude's fighting like the guy at the top of the Matterhorn at Disneyland.
4905480	4907200	That's what it looks like.
4907200	4911640	Man vs Beast, that's what that is.
4911640	4917040	That's on the PSP this week, as well as Yuusha 32nd from Marvelous comes out this week as
4917040	4918040	well.
4918040	4921000	I wonder if that's a version of 30 Second Hero, or Half Minute, oh yes it is, it's Half
4921000	4925960	Minute Hero Part 2 comes out this week in Japan, that could be a lot of fun.
4925960	4932560	So that's on the PSP this week, and going to the Nintendo Wii, Epic Mickey gets a release
4932560	4936040	in Japan this week finally, so they must have localized it for Japan, I know Disney's pretty
4936040	4939200	big over there, so they probably took a little while for them to localize it all.
4939200	4941440	They had to add Duffy to it.
4941440	4942440	Maybe.
4942440	4944160	Because Duffy is bigger than Mickey in Japan.
4944160	4945160	Is it really?
4945160	4946600	Actually Duffy is pretty big.
4946600	4953040	Family fishing as well on the Wii, and lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Nazo Waku Yakata
4953040	4956760	Otono Aida Ni Ade Ni comes out.
4956760	4960920	This looks like, is this a Professor Layton game?
4960920	4962400	It would appear so.
4962400	4966560	So it's Professor Layton's Haunted Mansion or something like that on the 3DS.
4966560	4969960	There you go, your Japanese release dates.
4969960	4971920	As I horribly butcher the names as I always do.
4971920	4974080	In Europe, two things.
4974080	4978040	Limbo for PC and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.
4978040	4979040	On Xbox 360.
4979040	4980240	That is an awesome game.
4980240	4981240	That's it.
4981240	4982240	That is an incredibly awesome game.
4982240	4986600	I heard it was not leaked early, but there was some URL where you could get the game
4986600	4989000	early through the store or something.
4989000	4990000	How is it?
4990000	4991000	Haven't played it yet.
4991000	4992000	But I want to.
4992000	4993000	I haven't got a chance to play it.
4993000	4994000	I got it downloaded.
4994000	4995800	So how do you know it's amazing?
4995800	4996800	Based on the videos.
4996800	4997800	Oh I see.
4997800	5000080	I'm making an assumption based on trailers.
5000080	5001080	It looks amazing.
5001080	5003680	I'm just giving you crap.
5003680	5005400	It looks monochrome.
5005400	5010920	Well, it's got a unique art style to it.
5010920	5015220	Insanely Twisted.
5015220	5020680	So let's talk a little bit more about earnings and lack thereof.
5020680	5029280	THQ is disappointed in their earnings for fiscal quarter 2, including Red Faction and
5029280	5031080	the performance of that.
5031080	5034600	And they are thinking, of course, quarter 3 could be its best.
5034600	5039880	Oh I'm sorry, it was quarter 1 that they were pissed off about.
5039880	5043000	These fiscal quarters get confusing.
5043000	5047560	Of course they are saying, sales of Red Faction Armageddon and our licensed kid titles were
5047560	5049740	below expectations.
5049740	5055320	The late release of UFC Personal Trainer also adversely impacted the quarter.
5055320	5063120	You know, THQ, I mean, you had a Kung Fu Panda game come out and you decided to make it You
5063120	5064120	Draw Only.
5064120	5070140	Not a good choice, I gotta say.
5070140	5075200	Of course they are saying that the net loss of $38.4 million, and most of the losses are
5075200	5077320	from deferred revenue.
5077320	5083960	Of course the company is not counting yet, because it's going towards their online services
5083960	5084960	for its games.
5084960	5092480	And of course Q3 for them is going to be Saints of the Third, WWE 12, and the You Draw tablet
5092480	5097560	for the 360 and PS3, among other things.
5097560	5103680	Red Faction did so poorly that it will not be continuing on in any meaningful way.
5103680	5106760	So it is done, fortunately.
5106760	5110000	Your break man is crying in our chat room over the death of Red Faction.
5110000	5111000	How do you feel about it, Loki?
5111000	5112000	Weren't you a fan of that series?
5112000	5113000	Nope.
5113000	5114000	Never really.
5114000	5115000	Why not?
5115000	5116000	I just didn't play it.
5116000	5117000	It's not that I don't like it or anything.
5117000	5118000	I mean, it looked cool.
5118000	5119000	It's volition.
5119000	5120000	I love volition.
5120000	5122200	So it's part your fault that the series died, basically.
5122200	5123760	Yeah, it's because I didn't buy it.
5123760	5124760	Exactly.
5124760	5132600	So if you are mad about the death of Red Faction, just send those cards and letters to Loki.
5132600	5133600	So yeah.
5133600	5136400	It just didn't do that well.
5136400	5140160	And you would have thought, you know, a game with a unicorn that shoots rainbows out of
5140160	5141160	its ass.
5141160	5142160	It would have been awesome.
5142160	5145920	Which, by the way, I hope to God that they bring that weapon over to Saints Row the Third,
5145920	5148720	because that would be amazing.
5148720	5153120	And then of course, one of the things that they were experimenting with, starting with
5153120	5158800	MX vs ATV, is releasing a game for a lower price point and then hoping to make that money
5158800	5162880	up back with download content.
5162880	5165720	So they did try that with MX vs ATV Alive.
5165720	5172500	They put it out at $39.99, and their idea was of course to come out with a robust product
5172500	5177360	at $39.99 price point, build a large install base more quickly, and then monetize that
5177360	5182080	install base through rapid and large number of DLC drops.
5182080	5184600	Unfortunately it didn't work.
5184600	5189040	It says, the only problem is the game didn't move enough units to turn, or in turn, move
5189040	5192960	enough download content to make the experiment a success.
5192960	5199840	So the key to learning was that it was not a successful experiment.
5199840	5203960	The $39.99 price point, while good, gave us good acceleration of sales, but that wasn't
5203960	5209520	enough to drive the install base where we wanted it to be, obviously.
5209520	5214480	It just wasn't working out.
5214480	5219200	Break Man in chat is calling you Darth Loki.
5219200	5221640	He's very upset about this whole Red Faction thing, just so you know.
5221640	5224440	You know who you need to blame, okay?
5224440	5228360	You know who put their logo onto that game?
5228360	5229360	That would be Syfy.
5229360	5232800	Syfy Channel had a fucking movie.
5232800	5235880	That was Syfy Games.
5235880	5242880	If you want to talk about someone putting out a poor product, that would be Syfy.
5242880	5247560	So that's who you need to blame.
5247560	5250440	So yeah, that kind of sucks for them, but at least you know what?
5250440	5253600	I can guarantee that Quarter 3 is going to be amazing, because fucking Saints for the
5253600	5254600	Third.
5254600	5256080	That shit is going to sell like crazy.
5256080	5257080	Nice.
5257080	5263480	Alright, well, part of me didn't want to talk about this next story, but this next story
5263480	5264720	just really makes me angry.
5264720	5270120	There's so much to hate in this next story, and I apologize for bringing it up, but you
5270120	5271120	know what?
5271120	5275840	This should piss you off too, because you have the power to change things.
5275840	5281560	As you guys know, if you ever watch a television, you know that there was a horrible, horrible
5281560	5288240	tragedy in Norway this past week, and you had this just crazy asshole, and I'm not even
5288240	5289240	going to say his name.
5289240	5291440	I'm not going to show you his picture, because he doesn't deserve to have it shown.
5291440	5297500	He's a crazy asshole, and he blew up a building, and he shot a bunch of kids at a camp, because
5297500	5300800	I guess he was afraid of what they were going to grow up into or something like that.
5300800	5305820	Just bullshit excuse for doing a crazy, batshit, stupid thing that killed like 77 people, including
5305820	5308200	a bunch of teenagers, which is beyond fucked.
5308200	5313040	I mean, this guy is worse than Satan.
5313040	5314960	He's worse than Satan's farts.
5314960	5315960	He's just terrible.
5315960	5318760	He's a terrible human being, but yeah.
5318760	5325480	So anyway, obviously, this horrific thing happened, and what happens when a horrific
5325480	5326880	situation happens?
5326880	5327940	You want to blame something.
5327940	5328940	You want to blame someone?
5328940	5329940	You want to blame something.
5329940	5331800	So why am I bringing it up here on Orange Lawns Radio?
5331800	5332800	Guess who got blamed?
5332800	5333800	Video game.
5333800	5334800	That's right.
5334800	5340120	Video game retailers have pulled World of Warcraft and Call of Duty after the shooting,
5340120	5345240	some of the big retailers, because I guess this asshole wrote some manifesto that either
5345240	5346320	talked about the games.
5346320	5352120	I think he had actually said he learned how to shoot or whatever in Call of Duty, which
5352120	5357320	I don't know why you would take what a crazy asshole says at face value, but whatever.
5357320	5364360	I mean, this just infuriates me, because it's like, don't pay attention to this stupid asshole.
5364360	5369960	By banning these games, I feel like you're validating what he says, and that's the last
5369960	5371800	thing you should do in a situation like this.
5371800	5374400	It's so irritating.
5374400	5379820	He said that Warcraft provided a useful cover story for the time he spent in seclusion plotting
5379820	5381440	his terrorist attacks.
5381440	5386000	So it wasn't even that he was playing WoW, it's just saying he was playing WoW made it
5386000	5388680	for a good excuse.
5388680	5393000	And then playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was a way to keep his skills honed.
5393000	5398860	So the retailers Co-Op Norway and Plate Companyit, I can't say these Norwegian names, but something
5398860	5400760	like that, they pulled the games.
5400760	5407080	They are saying it's a temporary removal, but as far as I'm concerned, you know what,
5407080	5409360	don't validate this guy.
5409360	5410360	Irritating.
5410360	5416320	Now, we will say this, Spaceworld is another retailer, they refused to pull the games,
5416320	5419920	saying it saw no connection between the games and the tragedy.
5419920	5425320	Quote, we have never seen any research that games alone have led to such incidents.
5425320	5430920	So if you live in Norway, that would be A plus Spaceworld, F minus these other guys.
5430920	5433760	So shame on that.
5433760	5438440	But then of course, it doesn't end there.
5438440	5441600	There was a very interesting opinion piece that showed up on a Forbes blog.
5441600	5444420	Of course, Forbes magazine, hugely financial, right?
5444420	5449000	And so this guy, now granted, this is an opinion piece, but he talks about an expert saying
5449000	5455000	that if you blame video games for the tragic massacres, like what happened in Norway, what
5455000	5457320	happened in Columbine, it's racist.
5457320	5463400	I don't know if that's the word I would choose to use, but I guess that's what this
5463400	5465120	article is saying here.
5465120	5469600	Clinical psychologist Christopher Ferguson, a leading expert on video game violence and
5469600	5474520	mass killings at Texas A&M International University said, video games aren't to blame for the
5474520	5477160	tragedy, nor is Doom, nor is Quake, and so on.
5477160	5483920	In fact, he believes that placing the blame on video games whenever a white male is guilty
5483920	5488360	of a killing spree is racist.
5488360	5494920	Weird, but I can't say he's told, I don't know.
5494920	5499040	Keep in mind, keep in mind, and this is something that needs to be defined for the entirety
5499040	5500960	of America.
5500960	5505920	Racism does not mean white against black, white against this.
5505920	5510200	It means one race against another.
5510200	5514560	Or it's making a judgment based on racial factors only.
5514560	5515560	Correct.
5515560	5521340	And this time he's saying because white males commit heinous acts, instantly blaming
5521340	5524960	video games is racist.
5524960	5525960	I would say bigoted.
5525960	5526960	Yeah, I know.
5526960	5527960	That's a better word.
5527960	5530200	Racist just isn't the right word for me.
5530200	5532840	But it is sort of profiling.
5532840	5533840	That's a good word.
5533840	5534840	Profiling.
5534840	5539920	But racist, I think that word cuts really deep.
5539920	5545880	For lack of the better, or maybe just for, you know, shock value, but it really is profiling
5545880	5549320	and a bit of bigotry.
5549320	5550320	Yeah.
5550320	5552120	That's what it is.
5552120	5556040	And the doctor goes on to say, mass killings are going to happen and there's nothing anyone
5556040	5557440	can do about it.
5557440	5561560	Fortunately, they're not going to happen very often, but they're like lightning strikes.
5561560	5566240	Let's see, quote, I know it's a little controversial to say, but there's a certain type of racism
5566240	5567800	in place of these killings.
5567800	5571880	When shootings happen in an inner city in minority populated schools, video games are
5571880	5572880	never brought up.
5572880	5576640	But when these things happen in white majority schools and in the suburbs, people start to
5576640	5578920	freak out and video games are inevitably blamed.
5578920	5583320	I think that there's a certain element of racism or ignorance here.
5583320	5587640	People really want to know what kind of boogeyman we can hang this on and video games are still
5587640	5591280	the top choice when it comes to any type of tragedy.
5591280	5595800	If you want to read more on this, you can go to blog.forbes.com and read the full article
5595800	5596800	there.
5596800	5597800	Let me read another quote from this.
5597800	5602160	It's just really interesting, for lack of a better word.
5602160	5605760	There are groups out there who are going to blame video games on everything.
5605760	5608040	They're like ambulance chasers, really.
5608040	5612000	I think it's irresponsible and thoughtless to try to make political gain off of someone
5612000	5614760	else's tragedy, but they're going to do it.
5614760	5615760	That's what they do.
5615760	5618800	But even those groups have been much quieter with the Oslo tragedy.
5618800	5622720	And you know, we had another follow up story in our show role that I neglected to copy
5622720	5627400	the link for, but in a nutshell, some crazy religious group is trying to get the games
5627400	5629680	banned here in the U.S. because of the Norway shooting.
5629680	5632360	And that quote I agree with.
5632360	5638540	These guys are like ambulance chasers to push their own agenda and they are exploiting a
5638540	5642800	disgusting scenario to promote their own agenda and that is sick.
5642800	5645640	And that part I agree with.
5645640	5649000	So really fascinating study.
5649000	5650000	I don't know.
5650000	5651000	Draw your own opinions.
5651000	5652000	Choose your own words.
5652000	5653000	But, you know.
5653000	5656040	Well, you know, you know what the whole thing is?
5656040	5661440	And this is my little commentary on the whole situation.
5661440	5664400	Stop looking for something to blame other than the people themselves.
5664400	5665400	Yeah.
5665400	5669120	Kaishudo in the chat room says, Rob, don't jump on the side of one nut case that goes
5669120	5671240	against another nut case's view.
5671240	5673540	I'm not totally with this guy.
5673540	5677720	Like I said, I get what he's saying, but I don't know if racism would be the word I'd
5677720	5678720	use.
5678720	5681200	Like profiling, like Jamie said, I think is maybe a better word to use.
5681200	5687000	But, you know, when he does talk about the ambulance chaser and how people will use these
5687000	5691560	situations to promote their own agendas, I will say, yes, I agree with him on that.
5691560	5696920	Weren't we just talking about politicians and the whole Supreme Court thing earlier?
5696920	5702420	I mean, wasn't that all kind of promoting Leland Yee's own political agenda and continuing
5702420	5704520	to promote his own?
5704520	5710860	I mean, that part, I am with him and a certain Lord Voldemort wouldn't have done this in
5710860	5712160	the past at all.
5712160	5720960	Well, and that's really, again, I think a failing of society in general that and OK,
5720960	5728940	I think that if you look at things maybe a hundred years ago or look into another culture,
5728940	5734220	people will were more likely to own up to what was their mistake.
5734220	5739440	It was considered the mature thing, the honorable thing to do, to own up to your own mistake,
5739440	5747880	to put the blame where it was to not make those who were circumstantially a part of
5747880	5750120	it, pay for it.
5750120	5756280	But those who are specifically responsible for it instead, now we have this, oh, well,
5756280	5761240	you're so outraged and yeah, OK, the person who did it is in jail, but we want to blame
5761240	5763300	it on something else because we want more punishment.
5763300	5765760	We want a little bit more drama out of this.
5765760	5767540	It's drama whoring is what it is.
5767540	5769600	People want more drama.
5769600	5771960	And really, it should be.
5771960	5775800	X person was criminally insane.
5775800	5777600	I don't care what they did.
5777600	5785240	I don't care if they played My Little Pony, you know, while wearing mantis and and doing
5785240	5787000	ballet in a little pink, really, too, too.
5787000	5788280	I don't care.
5788280	5789280	I do not care.
5789280	5792080	I don't care that J. Edgar Hoover was a transvestite.
5792080	5793080	He was a bastard.
5793080	5795800	Him being a transvestite had nothing to do with being a bastard.
5795800	5799760	All those things, by the way, that she mentioned before are able to be done in Dead Rising
5799760	5802760	2 off the record.
5802760	5803760	Yes, that is true.
5803760	5810960	Capcom has your your weird, sick, twisted, I'm sorry, but the word Capcom is still a
5810960	5814080	I have a bad Pavlov's response to that word this week.
5814080	5819320	But my my point being is that whatever they did in their private life, whatever they do
5819320	5826840	on the side has nothing to do with their final action.
5826840	5830640	It may have been, OK, well, I've done all this and it's led up to this point.
5830640	5833520	But really, it's what goes on in the head.
5833520	5839200	If they're not right in the head, they're not going to do something right to begin with.
5839200	5844660	If they're crazy, OK, yeah, maybe they'll get some pleasure out of playing a video game
5844660	5848760	for a little while, but they're going to need something else a little bit later.
5848760	5854800	It's just a bump on, you know, a ripple in the ocean, if that makes sense.
5854800	5858880	It's a little pebble in the pond on the way to the big boulder falling in and damming
5858880	5859880	the whole thing.
5859880	5862020	Does that make sense?
5862020	5868240	It does, but I'm just this whole thing is just I just irritates me.
5868240	5870940	I'm just sick of the blame game.
5870940	5873800	That's a big problem with society.
5873800	5879880	People need to freakin grow up and also have the maturity to put the blame on who it needs
5879880	5882880	to be put on, which is the person who did it.
5882880	5885320	It doesn't matter what else they're into.
5885320	5890640	You know, they could be into like latex fetish porn.
5890640	5893880	He could have been a concert trained piano player.
5893880	5897720	OK, like, OK, the guy in Japan who was the cannibal.
5897720	5900680	Oh, I'm using him as example.
5900680	5904560	He was a cultured, respected person.
5904560	5911040	He was smart, lived a very good life, but he ate some chick that he went out on dinner
5911040	5912040	with.
5912040	5915320	He just gave into the temptation of flesh, which, by the way, now he's actually a paid
5915320	5916320	lecturer.
5916320	5917320	Just letting you know.
5917320	5923320	Ah, and I hear he's eating it up all the attention, but my point is fired.
5923320	5924320	OK.
5924320	5925320	All right.
5925320	5929160	So here's another here's another example, and I'm not just saying this because I'm Jewish.
5929160	5930160	Hitler.
5930160	5933880	Oh, God, failed painter.
5933880	5941160	He failed his entrance into a prestigious art school, so he joined the military.
5941160	5943200	He was a vegetarian.
5943200	5950680	You would not assume vegetarian and painter would lead to mass murderer, but it did.
5950680	5955160	Are you going to blame all vegetarians and painters now for being potential mass murdering
5955160	5956160	fuckheads?
5956160	5957160	Well, vegetarians, maybe.
5957160	5958160	I'm kidding.
5958160	5959160	I'm kidding.
5959160	5960160	I'm kidding.
5960160	5964920	A little pita is just psycho anyway, but no, Jamie, you really murdered that onion in your
5964920	5965920	salad.
5965920	5973640	But but my point is, but my point is, you know, it doesn't matter what their hobbies
5973640	5974640	are.
5974640	5976800	It doesn't matter the walk of life they come from.
5976800	5977800	Crazy is fucking crazy.
5977800	5979440	And you blame the person.
5979440	5983160	You don't see anybody blaming vegetarians for, you know, one hundred thousand people
5983160	5984160	being killed.
5984160	5986200	You don't see anyone blaming Hitler.
5986200	5989760	Legend of Zaku in our chat room says, Jamie, you have to accept that playing the blame
5989760	5994320	game ever since the Salem witch trials and you see what happened then.
5994320	5996320	A bunch of innocent people died.
5996320	5998000	You think we'd learn from history?
5998000	5999580	No, because people are stupid.
5999580	6001040	There may have been some witches in there.
6001040	6003040	We don't know.
6003040	6005480	All right.
6005480	6006480	Enough.
6006480	6007480	Enough.
6007480	6009740	On that note, Loki has effectively killed the conversation.
6009740	6011580	So let's change things up a bit.
6011580	6016920	I need some happy goddammit.
6016920	6021080	Every week here on the show, Dark Soccer takes a trip down memory lane and visits a classic
6021080	6022080	video game.
6022080	6024920	She says, hey, you need to be playing this game.
6024920	6025920	What?
6025920	6028080	I do have to repeat what William said.
6028080	6029080	All right.
6029080	6031160	The fallacy of correlation equals causation.
6031160	6034680	Now, can we do the classic game?
6034680	6035680	Yes.
6035680	6037360	Dark Soccer wins the classic game of the week.
6037360	6038360	StarTropics.
6038360	6042600	At least you picked a really good classic game of the week.
6042600	6045120	You know, I actually didn't really play that game all that much.
6045120	6046120	Really?
6046120	6047120	Yeah.
6047120	6052440	But it's such a cool, but I remember playing it and enjoying it when I did, I just got
6052440	6053440	lazy.
6053440	6055600	My best friend in fourth grade and I stayed up all night playing this game.
6055600	6057280	But it's a lot of people's favorite games.
6057280	6060600	So it's like, why shouldn't I bring up StarTropics, right?
6060600	6061600	Right.
6061600	6063480	So it was an action adventure RPG.
6063480	6069520	It came out by Nintendo in 1990 for the NES, and it was never released or intended to be
6069520	6070520	released in Japan.
6070520	6074840	It only came out in North America and Europe, but it was designed by Japanese designers
6074840	6080860	who lived in the U.S., written and directed by Genyo Takeda of Nintendo Integrated Research
6080860	6083740	and Development, who also gave us Punch-Out!
6083740	6089320	And it came out on the North American Virtual Console on January 7th, 2008, and on the PAL
6089320	6091640	region on January 11th.
6091640	6095280	And of course I had a sequel, which was Zoda's Revenge, StarTropics 2, in 1994.
6095280	6098840	That was the year I, not telling people what I did.
6098840	6103040	So you start off as, I graduated high school.
6103040	6109280	Mike Jones is visiting his uncle, who is named Dr. J and he lives on Sea Island.
6109280	6113960	And he finds that Dr. J has gone missing and Babu, his assistant, who also sounds a lot
6113960	6121520	like Baloo from the Jungle Book, lets Mike use the submarine to basically go look for
6121520	6128680	Dr. J. So it starts off all of his adventures, he thinks aliens are involved, and basically
6128680	6134560	he finds Dr. J by the wreckage of an alien escape pod.
6134560	6141400	So they think it's the Argonians, so he has to go to another ship and do all this stuff.
6141400	6142400	And then Zoda comes!
6142400	6146440	And I'm not going to say any more, because there's more stuff to the game than just what
6146440	6147440	I'm saying.
6147440	6149440	And there's also children adoption involved too.
6149440	6151800	I just thought I'd mention that.
6151800	6153800	But you don't adopt the children.
6153800	6155560	No, you don't adopt children.
6155560	6160600	So basically it's a 2D top down perspective, kind of like Zelda in the dungeon areas.
6160600	6168760	But it is linear, consistent storyline, and the story progresses basically with talking
6168760	6171360	to NPCs and doing certain actions.
6171360	6175120	And then you have to, you know, go to your little dungeon-y areas.
6175120	6184640	So it switches mechanics there where it has a zoomed in type of perspective.
6184640	6191520	So basically you get weapons and items, baseball themed in many cases.
6191520	6197080	And you basically, well you also get baseballs but they're called wonder horse hides.
6197080	6205200	And cleats known as spikes and bullas and shuriken and slingshots and mirrors and different
6205200	6206200	types of stuff.
6206200	6209600	But basically you get all kinds of things that help you progress through the game and
6209600	6213560	fight all of the various baddies.
6213560	6218000	So you get a life meter of 22 hearts, kind of like Link.
6218000	6222600	In fact it looks a lot like, you know, the Legend of Zelda life bar.
6222600	6226520	And you can find big hearts that are again like the heart containers in Zelda.
6226520	6230440	And you can get vitamin X that fills up all of your hearts.
6230440	6236480	Even though, you know, you will lose of course help when you take damage.
6236480	6243640	So you can also get try your luck signs that are, you know, basically can give you extra
6243640	6244640	lives in the game.
6244640	6245840	You only start off with three.
6245840	6250600	And if you lose all of your lives at the beginning of a dungeon, I mean in a dungeon then you'll
6250600	6253600	have to go back to the beginning.
6253600	6255640	So basically you've got, you know, your boss characters.
6255640	6258200	It's RPG stuff.
6258200	6265640	So it's, you know, like I said, I didn't get to play a whole bunch of it, but I know a
6265640	6266640	lot of people liked it.
6266640	6270360	We got to talk about the letter that came with the game.
6270360	6271360	Yes, yes.
6271360	6272440	There was a letter.
6272440	6276560	My friend, we had no idea that this was, Oh my God, it was the coolest fucking thing when
6276560	6278520	you were like nine or 10.
6278520	6284840	You get a parchment letter and actually not, not, not any, like it actually came with the
6284840	6287960	box, like just, you know, it's not, she's not talking about like something you get in
6287960	6288960	the game.
6288960	6290320	It was a tangible thing that came in the box.
6290320	6292320	Made of parchment.
6292320	6293320	Yes.
6293320	6296760	And basically it has a letter from Dr. Jones addressed to Mike.
6296760	6302740	And I, by the way, I actually did have a copy of the letter because when I rented Star Tropics
6302740	6308360	back in the day, they included the letter with the rental and I kept it.
6308360	6315400	Um, but basically, um, it's like you intercepted the letter and we're being, uh, invited to
6315400	6318720	play the game on Mike's behalf.
6318720	6323800	And then, um, you get a message from your uncle, evil aliens from a distant planet tell
6323800	6326160	Mike to dip my letter in water.
6326160	6335600	So if you have the letter, the original letter, then you could, um, put, um, what was that
6335600	6336600	thing with the water?
6336600	6337600	That had the secret message?
6337600	6338600	Yeah.
6338600	6339600	The letter you, whatever.
6339600	6340600	Yeah.
6340600	6341600	Subcode in it.
6341600	6342600	Yeah.
6342600	6344600	And I think it was supposed to be able to do it without damaging the letter.
6344600	6345600	Yeah.
6345600	6346600	Oh yeah.
6346600	6347600	You could do it without damaging the letter.
6347600	6348600	Yeah.
6348600	6349600	But, um, but you had a secret message in there.
6349600	6354320	I think it had like, I, if I remember right, there was a spot, a very specific spot where
6354320	6355680	you would drip the water.
6355680	6357680	I can't totally recall.
6357680	6358680	Actually.
6358680	6360280	I'm going to see if I can find a picture of the letter.
6360280	6367280	I remember the code was seven 47 and is they actually like an airplane, Nintendo power
6367280	6373360	or was asked the question enough because people that rented the game or sometimes their letter
6373360	6376220	would be damaged or missing in the package.
6376220	6379040	So Nintendo power actually printed it after a while.
6379040	6380040	Yeah.
6380040	6382320	I had the call into the hotline because I bought it used.
6382320	6383320	Yeah.
6383320	6386440	It's kind of one of those things that like in retrospect, it probably wasn't a very good
6386440	6387440	idea.
6387440	6391840	Like Ubisoft don't pay attention to the letter thing.
6391840	6396880	Can you imagine that coming back as did as rights, uh, copyright protection.
6396880	6401000	Remember back in the day on the, uh, sorry, Jamie, but on the PC games, like the old school
6401000	6405820	PC games, we'd have to like thumb to page 26 of the manual and read the symbol that's
6405820	6408400	on there or get the plastic card that came with the game.
6408400	6411240	And I'm going to go all this insane copy protection back in the day.
6411240	6415200	That's kind of what this sounds like, but that one was cool.
6415200	6422760	Well now, um, for virtual console, the letter is included in the digital manual and it has
6422760	6426080	an image of the letter and a bucket of water at the bottom.
6426080	6430200	So you click on the image and the letter dips into the bucket and the code shows up.
6430200	6434720	Um, on the European release though, it just has a click here, link at the bottom and the
6434720	6435720	thing will pop up.
6435720	6439280	But I think it's kind of neat that, you know, you dunk the virtual letter.
6439280	6440280	It's cute.
6440280	6441280	It's cute.
6441280	6442280	Yeah.
6442280	6443280	I'm going to see if I can find a copy of it.
6443280	6444280	I'll link it in the chat room.
6444280	6445280	But yeah.
6445280	6446800	I was surprised they haven't remade that series yet.
6446800	6450000	I'm kind of surprised too.
6450000	6451620	Like they did have a sequel to star tropics.
6451620	6453320	I know like it was like soda's revenge.
6453320	6454320	Wasn't soda's revenge.
6454320	6459560	Wasn't the last NES game they made or no, that was, it was right at the end though.
6459560	6465040	I think Wario's woods was technically the last NES game they ever made, but Zoda's revenge
6465040	6466040	was right at the end.
6466040	6467040	All right.
6467040	6468040	We've got the letter.
6468040	6469040	Nice.
6469040	6470040	Oh, that's a bad image.
6470040	6473400	Um, there we go.
6473400	6476920	And I am going to, um, put a link to that in the chat room.
6476920	6477920	Yeah.
6477920	6478920	It'd be fun.
6478920	6482480	If anyone wants to see, it's actually, and I love the name of the website, socks make
6482480	6485440	people sexy.net slash put on tumbler.
6485440	6486440	Put on the tumbler.
6486440	6487440	Okay.
6487440	6488440	But I'm just gonna say it to you.
6488440	6489440	Okay.
6489440	6491160	images slash star tropics underscore letter dot JPEG.
6491160	6492160	Good.
6492160	6494160	Check it out.
6494160	6499600	This guy looks like a Rob, the robot, by the way, this navcom guy in the, uh, little ship
6499600	6502640	that you navigate just so you know, it's just like a Rob the robot.
6502640	6503640	All right.
6503640	6504640	Anyhow, there it is.
6504640	6506720	Your classic game of the week star tropics.
6506720	6507720	One of my favorites too.
6507720	6509840	Good, good, good call dark Sakura.
6509840	6513600	Even though that wasn't one that maybe you remember as fondly, that was, that was a classic
6513600	6514600	game for the rest of us.
6514600	6518160	There are a few games I haven't played or haven't played a whole lot of, but that doesn't
6518160	6521160	mean that other people haven't, you know, played them.
6521160	6522160	There you go.
6522160	6525720	So, all right, we're going to take a quick break guys, but when we come back, there is
6525720	6529520	plenty more of orange launch radio to come, including some rapid fire news.
6529520	6533240	Uh, the FUs of the week in the mail back, of course, your Twitter topics is twitter.com
6533240	6534240	slash O L R.
6534240	6536040	And of course more phone calls.
6536040	6545680	When we get back with more of orange lounge radio.
6545680	6548240	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.
6548240	6555120	We are live of course, with our 422nd episode on this July the 31st of 2011.
6555120	6557840	All right, we're into part B of the show.
6557840	6561560	We're going to start off part B as we always do with some rapid fire news.
6561560	6563760	So Loki, start us off with some rapid fire news.
6563760	6564760	Ah, yes.
6564760	6566600	Um, lots of fun stuff.
6566600	6571480	Let's talk a little bit about rock band and of course, um, they hit a major milestone
6571480	6572480	this week.
6572480	6577920	3000 tracks now on their service, both combined in the regular rock band store and of course
6577920	6580280	the rock band network stuff.
6580280	6589640	Um, and to celebrate this, harmonix is actually hooking up, uh, 30 people, um, in America,
6589640	6595280	um, with a hundred songs of their choosing either on Xbox or PS3.
6595280	6598000	And of course then, you know, it's 3000 songs.
6598000	6604440	There's different ways to enter, um, via Twitter, Facebook or the rock band forums.
6604440	6609720	And um, yeah, hopefully someone out there is going to enjoy those hundred songs if you
6609720	6610720	win.
6610720	6618320	Um, of course, as of us recording this, it ended about a few days ago, so, uh, so much
6618320	6619320	for that.
6619320	6621120	And then snooze, you lose.
6621120	6627280	I forgot to enter to, uh, of course, uh, you know, you don't win the hundred songs.
6627280	6631640	There are some other things coming out this week including, um, and these are all individual
6631640	6632640	songs.
6632640	6633640	They don't have any packs this week.
6633640	6635960	Uh, make some noise by the beastie boys.
6635960	6637440	That's going to be two bucks.
6637440	6638680	No sleep to Brooklyn.
6638680	6644840	Um, also two bucks and that's also from the beastie boys, um, brought a barracuda by heart.
6644840	6647400	Uh, that's two bucks.
6647400	6648980	That's pretty awesome.
6648980	6652360	Super bad parts one and two by James Brown.
6652360	6654140	That's also two bucks.
6654140	6658420	And tell me something good by Rufus featuring Chaka Khan.
6658420	6660040	That's also two bucks.
6660040	6666440	And you can get some pro bass and pro guitar expansions for a barracuda and super bad parts
6666440	6668280	one and two.
6668280	6669280	Not time for that yet.
6669280	6670280	Sorry.
6670280	6673360	Uh, yes.
6673360	6678480	It's funny because Duke Nukem still thinks it's popular, but Duke Nukem Forever is going
6678480	6683500	to be getting some new, uh, download content, new multiplayer modes and maps.
6683500	6690440	This fall, um, they're going to have a Hail to the Icons parody pack and it's going to
6690440	6700680	have several parodies of, um, different games including, um, they've got a parody of Team
6700680	6703920	Fortress 2, um, that's going to be in there.
6703920	6711360	Uh, two forts one bridge that's going to include hats and, you know, it says Duke doesn't need
6711360	6712360	no stinking hats.
6712360	6716520	Give him a minigun and he'll beat off all, um, corners.
6716520	6717720	He'll beat off?
6717720	6718720	Or all comers.
6718720	6719720	Okay.
6719720	6720720	Um, okay.
6720720	6723800	Um, inferno time machine engage.
6723800	6730560	Uh, Duke does combat in a hellish landscape of lava and teleporters who turn on the 16
6730560	6731680	bit graphics.
6731680	6734800	More importantly, where did this DFG come from?
6734800	6739960	Ha ha ha, you're parodying Doom, a game that's how old?
6739960	6744920	Oh, as old as your last game, because that's how long it took to get it out.
6744920	6745920	Ha ha ha.
6745920	6751160	Uh, sand pit, player's sake, roll of mini Duke in a giant sandbox with two bases on
6751160	6753360	either end made of child's toys.
6753360	6756360	This map features sticky grenades and Call of Duke.
6756360	6760080	Gee, I wonder what game that is parodying.
6760080	6763520	Duke engages in modern combat in a war-torn city.
6763520	6769160	Foes don't stand a chance against Duke when he spams them back with the noob tube.
6769160	6775920	Okay, and they're also gonna have freeze tag, which I guess is gonna be, um, players will
6775920	6780720	be able to freeze and shatter their opponents in huge succession for points and combos.
6780720	6781720	That's gonna be the new mode.
6781720	6785240	You know what the funny part about it, about all this?
6785240	6788480	All those games that you're parodying, way better than your own game.
6788480	6792200	Ha ha ha, joke's on you, dumbass.
6792200	6795480	So that'll be coming, if you bought Duke Nukem.
6795480	6800080	Hey, you know what, by the time that all this download content comes out, I bet you the
6800080	6805840	download content will be priced higher than the actual game, because it already got price
6805840	6806840	dropped, by the way.
6806840	6807840	Did it really?
6807840	6809560	$3,999 happened this week.
6809560	6810560	Wow.
6810560	6811560	Yeah.
6811560	6812560	That's a good sign.
6812560	6816480	You know, when you drop something really quick, that means it's selling well, right?
6816480	6817480	Right?
6817480	6818480	Yeah.
6818480	6830280	Um, and, yeah, ha ha ha, Operation Rainfall apparently is still not working out too well.
6830280	6834160	Xenoblade Chronicles is not coming out over here.
6834160	6839400	Of course, you know, this week, Nintendo released their upcoming software list, and Xenoblade
6839400	6842080	Chronicles, nowhere near to be found.
6842080	6846440	It is still scheduled for release in Europe, however, on August 19th, and of course, you
6846440	6853200	know, the game has been subject to ongoing campaigns by disgruntled American RPG fans,
6853200	6856560	and um, they're kinda pissed off that it's still not coming out over here.
6856560	6860640	Seen as it's being localized into languages that, you know, us Americans speak, so you
6860640	6863800	would think it'd be easy to publish it.
6863800	6864800	But Nintendo doesn't care.
6864800	6869360	Why don't they just put it on their downloadable serv- ohhhh, that's right, they don't really
6869360	6871400	have anything like that, yeah.
6871400	6874800	I mean, they have the Wii store, but- I don't know if you saw it, they announced this week
6874800	6878680	that guess what, they're gonna now start offering download content on the 3DS.
6878680	6880080	I heard about that, yeah.
6880080	6883640	That's like, wow, way to the party.
6883640	6885720	Well, I mean, didn't the Wii do that too?
6885720	6889960	I mean, the Wii had Rock Band, and you could download some stuff on there, so I don't think
6889960	6894960	it's exactly earth-shattering to hear that Nintendo's supporting DLC, it's really just
6894960	6895960	a matter of when.
6895960	6898840	But it's just not coming out yet, I mean, it's like they haven't built the infrastructure
6898840	6900080	into the 3DS.
6900080	6902640	There's no games worth it yet.
6902640	6903680	Wait.
6903680	6908880	Now what would be interesting is Nintendo saying, we are getting on board with that.
6908880	6910240	That would truly be something new.
6910240	6912200	That would be like Bizarro World.
6912200	6915920	Now that is something- Mario Kart with new downloadable tracks?
6915920	6916920	Exactly.
6916920	6918080	That is the story to wait for.
6918080	6919720	Is that what Nintendo's talking about?
6919720	6922040	Because then that's news.
6922040	6924080	Anyhow.
6924080	6925680	Moving on to some other news.
6925680	6929600	Street Fighter X Tekken is obviously on everybody's radar, especially if you're into fighting
6929600	6930600	games.
6930600	6935920	Fans of the characters, Dan, that might be Dark Sakura, she's a fan of Dan.
6935920	6940040	If you're a fan of Dan or a fan of Anna from Tekken, you might be disappointed.
6940040	6944720	Both of them have been announced as not in the roster, in fact they were booted out of
6944720	6945720	the game.
6945720	6950880	The series producer Yoshinori Ono has said that those characters won't be in Street Fighter
6950880	6957480	X Tekken because he was killed by a Tekken character at Comic-Con last year.
6957480	6964480	But I think the real reason is, quote, as much as I personally wanted to have a cool
6964480	6969120	Nina and Anna tag battle, the director was against putting Anna because we already had
6969120	6970120	Nina in.
6970120	6973760	Now, of course, Dan probably isn't gone for real real.
6973760	6979160	I would, at this point, knowing Capcom, wait for Street Fighter X Tekken Super or whatever.
6979160	6984600	Honestly, I think Anna's gonna be a palette swap for Nina.
6984600	6986360	Which is what she's been in other games.
6986360	6989840	Anna kind of played differently though, I loved Anna because she had her big heels and
6989840	6991160	everything, it was kind of fun.
6991160	6993200	Nina had the heels going on too, she had the big boots.
6993200	6994720	I know, it was just different with Anna.
6994720	6995720	It's hard to explain.
6995720	6999480	Well, Anna had the dress and was super girly with the short hair.
6999480	7002160	Yes, fun to play.
7002160	7003760	My old boss kind of looked like Anna.
7003760	7004760	Oh well, anyway.
7004760	7010440	There you go, so those characters will not be in Street Fighter X Tekken, sadly.
7010440	7014480	Some soundtrack related news, quite a bit of it actually, there's a write in music collection
7014480	7016700	that's due out on September 28th.
7016700	7020480	It's Team Entertainment is the record label, a four-disc compilation of music from the
7020480	7023680	write in series called The Lightning Strikes Back.
7023680	7028760	It will have music from write in the arcade from the 90s, write in 2, write in DX, write
7028760	7032960	in DX PlayStation, write in 3, and write in 4.
7032960	7035180	Coming out September 28th in Japan.
7035180	7041840	Also in soundtrack news, The King of Fighters XIII, the pre-orders will come with 15 years
7041840	7045840	of musical history, a four CD soundtrack compilation.
7045840	7047760	That's what Atlas is putting out there.
7047760	7050880	Try and get folks to pre-order The King of Fighters XIII.
7050880	7053640	That's pretty cool, actually.
7053640	7057200	There's also supposed to be some exclusive game modes in the console version of the game.
7057200	7062280	A story mode that will have new visuals and animations, a practice mode, a tutorial mode,
7062280	7065500	and other stuff that wasn't in the arcade but you would expect to see in a console release
7065500	7066680	of a fighter.
7066680	7073680	One other soundtrack news, Rhythm Heaven on the Wii is getting a four-disc soundtrack.
7073680	7079000	It's already out in Japan, Rhythm Heaven Wii, but it's coming out here as well.
7079000	7080160	So there you go.
7080160	7089200	A four-disc CD soundtrack coming out in Japan, August 24th for 4,800 yen, 150 songs.
7089200	7091520	Perfect in extended tracks included.
7091520	7096580	Lastly, on the plate tonight, not in soundtrack news but in sequel rumor news, TimeSplitters
7096580	7099880	4 rumored that there is a version of that coming.
7099880	7104840	I guess this is because of the official PlayStation Magazine UK's rumor machine section.
7104840	7108880	There's a rumor that says, quote, Gun-wielding monkeys are finally making a comeback.
7108880	7111680	A fourth TimeSplitters title is to be announced soon.
7111680	7116560	Of course, it is coming from the rumors, but when you consider it's the official PlayStation
7116560	7117560	Magazine.
7117560	7118560	I love me some TimeSplitters.
7118560	7119560	I know.
7119560	7120560	I bet you're excited about that.
7120560	7121560	So, we will see.
7121560	7122560	Are you giddy?
7122560	7127160	Uh, not until they actually announce something, because they've been talking new TimeSplitters
7127160	7128640	for a long time now.
7128640	7132520	All right, let's go to Dark Sakura.
7132520	7134860	In other news, we have the Endermen.
7134860	7135860	They're coming for you.
7135860	7141240	They're actually a new Minecraft mob, and they're just little black stick figures with
7141240	7142240	white eyes.
7142240	7143240	Like everything in Minecraft.
7143240	7146120	You know, but they're all black.
7146120	7151320	They actually remind me of, okay, do you ever remember in Mario Galaxy where there were
7151320	7156280	the little black guys that were standing on top of the world but you couldn't get to them
7156280	7158280	and they would just watch you?
7158280	7161200	That's what they look like to me.
7161200	7163760	And they're just there to be scary.
7163760	7165480	They're there to terrify you.
7165480	7169700	So that's all they're there for, and they're going to be in the next Minecraft update.
7169700	7176840	It's based off of, I guess, a character that was made on the Something Awful forums, Slenderman.
7176840	7183840	I watched, they have this ARG, it's called Marvel something, I forget what it's called.
7183840	7186880	And really creepy.
7186880	7190000	Really, really creepy.
7190000	7194200	The Slenderman's also been thrown in a number of other video games too, just in background
7194200	7196200	stuff.
7196200	7197200	Very creepy.
7197200	7201960	They'll basically stand still moving blocks around stuff, but if you move your reticle
7201960	7208160	over them, they'll stare at you and then they'll charge at you.
7208160	7212880	They can teleport and kill you.
7212880	7217160	I'm actually going to get a picture in the chatroom so they can see what it looks like.
7217160	7218720	There you go.
7218720	7223160	So moving forward, we also have something from Disney.
7223160	7231380	They want to buy UTV Ignition for $454 million.
7231380	7237080	Their base, this actually comes from develop, and it says Disney already owns 50.4% of UTV
7237080	7242040	and they're wanting to acquire the whole thing for its Bollywood films and TV shows.
7242040	7247000	So who knows, but they own Ignition, so that means there might be some issues.
7247000	7252880	And last but never least, and related to Disney a bit, Toy Story download content is coming
7252880	7254740	for LittleBigPlanet 2.
7254740	7263360	There will be, actually it's going to be on August 3rd in the UK, that's going to be £4.79
7263360	7271440	or €5.99, and that's nine Toy Story themed levels with two cut scenes, five levels and
7271440	7277880	two mini levels, two new music tracks, one new interactive music track, one new level
7277880	7282320	background, five materials, ten decorations, six objects, and 149 stickers.
7282320	7283320	That's pretty rad.
7283320	7288920	The costume pack, which is going to cost the same, has Buzz Lightyear gloves, helmet, legs,
7288920	7290520	teeth, and body.
7290520	7297880	Then there's Slinky Dog set, which has the feet, ears, hands, nose, skin, body, and tail.
7297880	7303720	There's Ham, which is a head, skin, and body, and Rex, which is the claws, head, skin, and
7303720	7304960	body.
7304960	7313240	And then you can also, though, download each set individually for £1.59 or €1.99.
7313240	7316600	Alright, I still got to get LittleBigPlanet 2.
7316600	7318120	I don't know why I keep missing the boat on that one.
7318120	7321680	I guess I keep waiting for a price cut that doesn't seem to be coming, but hopefully there'll
7321680	7325520	be like a Game of the Year edition or something this holiday like there was the first time.
7325520	7326520	So we'll see.
7326520	7330720	Anyhow, before I get back into some more news, I want to mention a couple things real quick,
7330720	7333360	kind of a second wave of housekeeping, if you will.
7333360	7337240	First off, if you enjoy Orange Lawns Radio, do check out another show that we produce
7337240	7338240	here.
7338240	7341360	It's called The Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth at www.hoardhouse.com.
7341360	7345800	It's myself and my buddy Xtfer, and this week we had special guest Ferrari, one of the guild
7345800	7350960	leaders for Xtfer's Guild, on Talking Smack About WoW, some really good Firelands and
7350960	7352160	raiding discussion this week.
7352160	7355240	So if you're a fan of WoW, check that out again, hoardhouse.com.
7355240	7356320	One more day.
7356320	7357320	What's one more day?
7357320	7359040	Oh, you get your last Firelands vendor, right?
7359040	7360040	I know.
7360040	7361040	You know you get a new mount from that.
7361040	7362040	I know!
7362040	7363040	You get like a little firebird thing.
7363040	7364040	I know!
7364040	7365040	SlaciousPop got that the other day.
7365040	7366040	I know, I know, I know, I know.
7366040	7367040	It's cute.
7367040	7368280	You'll be getting to ride a flaming bird.
7368280	7369280	I know.
7369280	7370280	Alright.
7370280	7376080	Also, the third podcast is probably delayed a little bit considering there's some personal
7376080	7381240	stuff going on and so forth, but we are still eyeing that at least by Labor Day, no later
7381240	7382240	than that.
7382240	7384960	We've already got things definitely in motion.
7384960	7387200	Yeah, so more hints coming.
7387200	7390660	Some of you have been begging me on Twitter for more information about that, so all I
7390660	7395800	will say is that, you know, certain components of this show, if you like it, you're gonna
7395800	7398120	really like the new show.
7398120	7401560	Otherwise, oh well, you still got this show.
7401560	7403560	It's all free, so don't complain.
7403560	7404560	Alright.
7404560	7405560	The other thing...
7405560	7406560	And they might learn a thing or two.
7406560	7407560	That's right.
7407560	7408560	You might.
7408560	7414000	Also, I want to say this, a new segment coming to OLR, actually.
7414000	7416320	You know how we have like some segments we like to do on the show?
7416320	7418760	Obviously, a lot of things you're very used to.
7418760	7422640	The Twitter topics, the Skype line we do at the end of the show, Classic Game of the Week
7422640	7424000	and so forth.
7424000	7427960	We've kind of talked amongst ourselves, you know, we like to mix it up once in a while
7427960	7428960	at OLR.
7428960	7432360	While we have a formula that works for us, once in a while we want to mix it up.
7432360	7437320	And one thing we want to feature more on the program is Indie Games.
7437320	7439520	So we're gonna have a new segment starting soon.
7439520	7440640	I can't say exactly when.
7440640	7443980	It just depends when I can get some folks on the show, but we're actually gonna spotlight
7443980	7444980	Indie Games.
7444980	7449000	We don't have a name for the segment yet, but we are gonna have, or I guess I should
7449000	7454760	say, invite developers onto the show to talk about their passion, their game and, you know,
7454760	7457040	share our space with the indie developers.
7457040	7461660	We've had some on in the past in more full interview capacity, but we decided we wanted
7461660	7465080	to have it be something that's a little more regular here on the show.
7465080	7469040	After all, we are an independent podcast, so we should do more supportive Indie Games.
7469040	7472280	You know, I like to think we give them a fair share and a fair shout out here on the show,
7472280	7476080	but I like to regularly feature something on the show, especially with so much that
7476080	7480660	you can drown in on Xbox Live, Indie Arcade and the fact that they don't really do anything
7480660	7482760	to call any of the notable releases to the top.
7482760	7487640	I think it'd be really nice to have something to at least call out one game you should be
7487640	7488760	checking out a week.
7488760	7491760	I want to point out, it won't just be limited to Xbox.
7491760	7497720	We're considering PC, Homebrew, as well as the iOS and iPhone and really Android and
7497720	7499200	indie type of phone games.
7499200	7503080	Pretty much any system that's easily accessible will cover it.
7503080	7507340	Hell, if somebody who's developing a new Dreamcast game wants to come on the show, I am all for
7507340	7510640	that, and I'm sure Dark Sakura's all over that too, because the fangirl she is.
7510640	7515400	So if you are a developer that wants to have your Indie Game featured on the show, I would
7515400	7519720	like to keep it to relatively new releases, but in the beginning I won't be too picky.
7519720	7523680	But something that's been out in the past few months or so, do drop me an email.
7523680	7529240	You can email me personally, rob at orangeloungeradio.com, or you can always drop the general email bag
7529240	7530240	as well.
7530240	7533080	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com will get you in touch with who you need to get in touch
7533080	7534080	with.
7534080	7535480	So that is coming to the show soon.
7535480	7538640	Whenever we get enough stuff in the pipeline where we have some things to feature, we're
7538640	7540400	going to spotlight that here in the show.
7540400	7541600	I'm excited.
7541600	7544880	Just think about it like the classic game of the week, but now it's going to be the
7544880	7545880	Indie game of the week.
7545880	7546880	The new classics.
7546880	7551080	I guess you can think about it that way, and it won't just be Dark Sakura telling you about
7551080	7553840	it, we want to have a discussion with the developer.
7553840	7557140	Although if a week goes by where maybe we're having a hard time getting somebody, we'll
7557140	7559080	talk about something that caught our eye.
7559080	7563440	Speaking of iOS, I want to talk about that real quick, and some of the iPhone games.
7563440	7566680	Because there's some really good stuff going on on the iPhone right now, like Groove Coaster.
7566680	7567680	Right?
7567680	7568680	Amazing.
7568680	7569680	We all agree.
7569680	7570680	We all agree.
7570680	7571680	I love Tiny Tower.
7571680	7572680	Okay, look.
7572680	7573680	Do you see this, Rob?
7573680	7574680	What?
7574680	7575680	You're downloading it now?
7575680	7576680	I will download Tiny Tower.
7576680	7577680	Here's the thing.
7577680	7578680	Tiny Tower.
7578680	7579680	Oh my God.
7579680	7580680	I should hate it.
7580680	7583760	It's no better than a Facebook game, but it's so adorable, and all the characters are little
7583760	7587520	8-bit characters, and they look so cute, and they have their little bit books that they
7587520	7588520	update.
7588520	7589520	And you know what I really love about-
7589520	7590520	There's one called Tiny Zoo.
7590520	7592800	You know what I love about Tiny Tower?
7592800	7595120	Let me tell you this about Tiny Tower.
7595120	7602080	What I love about it is that, yes, it's free-to-play, and they have these whole tower bucks things,
7602080	7606800	and if you want to buy the tower bucks, you can do that and move the game a lot faster.
7606800	7611880	But you don't have to, because once in a while, and more so than in most free-to-play games,
7611880	7615960	you'll get tipped a tower buck, or you'll get tower bucks as little incentive rewards.
7615960	7618800	And so it helps to move the game along a little bit.
7618800	7622960	And what I also love about it is that if you forget to check your tower for three weeks,
7622960	7626680	oh well, the lights were dark for three weeks, and you didn't make any money.
7626680	7628520	Your citizens don't move out.
7628520	7630960	They don't burn the building down in protest.
7630960	7634960	It's just, it doesn't require your tender love and care all the time.
7634960	7636360	So if you want to play it every day, you can.
7636360	7638360	If you want to play it once a week, you can.
7638360	7643320	That is good design, in my opinion, and where the freemium model should go.
7643320	7646040	And I do know people that have spent money on Tiny Tower.
7646040	7650140	I wouldn't, but I think if people want to, they can.
7650140	7651140	So there you go.
7651140	7655320	So, all right, so I'm looking at our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchy.com, and it does look
7655320	7661060	like some folks in chat are excited about the whole indie games, talking about that
7661060	7662160	segment coming up.
7662160	7666960	And Act Deaf there says, woo, new OLR segment.
7666960	7671280	Break Man in chat says, how will any of you ever have the time to actually play games
7671280	7673040	talking about the third podcast?
7673040	7674040	I will say this much.
7674040	7675040	Hey, I'm not working.
7675040	7676040	I am.
7676040	7680000	And yeah, adding a third podcast to the plate is going to be something.
7680000	7683960	It's not going to be a long show, and it's going to be something where we can record
7683960	7687720	several of them in a day, and produce it regularly.
7687720	7688720	I'm not going to lie.
7688720	7690080	That's the way it's going to be done.
7690080	7692080	But I think you guys will get a kick out of it.
7692080	7695160	It is going to be myself, DarkSakura, and Dan.
7695160	7698680	Loki is, of course, always welcome whenever he wants to come on, but he's got other stuff
7698680	7699800	he's got to do, too.
7699800	7702560	And Dan, of course, is going to add a whole new element, especially when we tell you more
7702560	7704360	about what it's about.
7704360	7709480	It'll be great.
7709480	7710480	Let's see.
7710480	7711480	Let's see.
7711480	7714240	Breakman in the chat says, Xbox Live Indie Games.
7714240	7716040	Those devs need to call OLR.
7716040	7717040	I agree.
7717040	7720120	So, please, again, get in touch with me, Rob at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
7720120	7723160	Who wants to be first?
7723160	7724160	And let's see.
7724160	7727280	Misty about Tiny Tower in chat says, hey, protest burning might be funny.
7727280	7728280	Once anyway, at least.
7728280	7731840	I do agree it would be nice to see them do a little more with some of the events and
7731840	7735840	so forth, but the game is still early in its life, and I'm sure there'll be update patches
7735840	7736840	and so forth.
7736840	7738560	Now, that's iOS gaming done well.
7738560	7743560	I'm going to tell you what iOS game blows, absolutely blows.
7743560	7745360	Capcom Arcade.
7745360	7746440	You check this out?
7746440	7754120	Capcom Arcade, you can play classic Capcom Arcade games like 1942 and, I don't know,
7754120	7758860	what else is in the, Ghosts and Goblins and Street Fighter and all that.
7758860	7764080	You can play those, and the deal is you can play like three games once for free.
7764080	7768320	You get like three tokens every day for free, but if you want more tokens, you have to pay
7768320	7772280	more, or you can buy a machine permanently for like three bucks, but it controls like
7772280	7773280	shit.
7773280	7777320	And I'll tell you what, Magic Sword came out this week, and I love Magic Sword.
7777320	7781160	That's like the best, like, Capcom 90s game for me.
7781160	7782600	I loved Magic Sword.
7782600	7786760	Yes, I love the one on Xbox and PlayStation Network, by the way, the whole remake, but
7786760	7790960	I love me some Magic Sword, and I was so excited when it came out to the phone that I played
7790960	7791960	it.
7791960	7793360	It controls like shit.
7793360	7799480	I cannot use, like, I hate the emulation of a thumb stick with the, it just doesn't work,
7799480	7803480	and then the game froze up on me halfway through the first stage, completely froze up on me,
7803480	7807160	and I was like, the music kept going, so I knew that the emulation was still running,
7807160	7812440	but the game itself just froze, and I was like, did anybody fucking test this, or did
7812440	7815880	they just decide to just put this shit out and see who'd buy it, because it seemed to
7815880	7821240	me like option B. So, yet another strike from Capcom this week.
7821240	7824280	That Capcom arcade needs to be tested better.
7824280	7826280	It sucks.
7826280	7828280	Anyhow.
7828280	7831000	So there you go, that's my iOS talk.
7831000	7833280	Let's get back into some other news.
7833280	7836600	So we'll do some long news with Loki.
7836600	7837600	Yes.
7837600	7844720	You know, and since we were, we were talking a little bit about Capcom, and they made an
7844720	7850200	errant judgment, if you will, back with Resident Evil Mercenaries, where they said, hey, you
7850200	7855280	know what, we're gonna make it impossible for you to erase your game's save, and everybody
7855280	7860040	was pissed, and hopefully we figured that maybe people learned by that, you know, that
7860040	7861040	lesson.
7861040	7863320	Well, no.
7863320	7869360	Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions from Namco also features a problem where your save files are
7869360	7872800	permanent and unable to be reset or erased.
7872800	7880640	Of course, they put this out, and you know, there's, you know, according to Game Life
7880640	7886080	blog, Wired's Game Life blog, there's simply no way to erase a save once it's been written
7886080	7887080	to the cartridge.
7887080	7890640	I've looked all over, even going as far as to ask a Namco Bandai representative, and
7890640	7893720	it doesn't seem like there's a way to erase a save game.
7893720	7899280	And you know, basically saying that the design doesn't just affect earned in-game awards,
7899280	7903800	which can't be deleted, but also high scores, meaning that the most recent high score is
7903800	7908840	the only one that the game records.
7908840	7915080	Apparently though, Namco, they have come to an explanation for it, and they're saying
7915080	7921200	that, here's how it works.
7921200	7928720	Pac-Man Tilt, it says the plus high score from the EX level one, it says it needs to
7928720	7934440	open 10 mils, let me really see what the high scores are here.
7934440	7939400	Score ranking, keeps one of each of the top scores mentioned above to submit to online
7939400	7945040	ranking boards, keeps the gamer's name in which the player can input via on-screen keyboard.
7945040	7953040	Yeah, it doesn't really say why they did that, it just shows how it's affected.
7953040	7958080	It says they confirmed that players have the option to share high scores online, but using
7958080	7964300	the same cartridge in different DS main posts to score twice, Namco Bandai didn't comment
7964300	7968520	on the decision-making process behind it.
7968520	7973920	Sounds like no decision was made, it sounds like just bad design again.
7973920	7982040	Yeah, other than, but if they were to copy Capcom's response, it would say that it was
7982040	7990280	an attempt to preserve the game's arcade style feel, and it would never do it again.
7990280	7996880	Here's my thing, the 3DS, okay, you've got very little penetration for the 3DS out there
7996880	8006000	right now, do you really need to hinder sales of any game on that system, and Pac-Man and
8006000	8010280	Galaga Dimensions, I don't know about you, but that's not really at the top of my list
8010280	8012120	of games I would want for the 3DS.
8012120	8014840	Well, they're great on Xbox Live Arcade, and it sounds like that's where they're going
8014840	8017080	to remain great, you know?
8017080	8021480	Yeah, but it's just like, really, you thought that was a good idea.
8021480	8027220	The thing that concerns me here, I mean, another, and I would say, I might have been interested
8027220	8030640	in these games if the price was right, but again, this whole save file thing, I can't
8030640	8035760	support this, and I don't, like, the excuse they're giving just fucking doesn't make sense.
8035760	8037840	They didn't really talk in us in circles.
8037840	8039320	No, they didn't really have an excuse.
8039320	8041000	There is, they gave no excuse.
8041000	8048080	This concerns me, because we have two companies that have made the same mistake that's very
8048080	8052680	fishy, and that's the whole used game market, right?
8052680	8057800	So it's, it's really fishy to me that we have two companies that have now done this.
8057800	8059800	You do understand people, like, I, I don't...
8059800	8060800	Is this a trend?
8060800	8066280	This isn't, this isn't gonna stop you, I mean, yeah, it will stop used game sales.
8066280	8069080	You know how it's gonna stop used game sales, or at least hinder it?
8069080	8073040	Because people, exactly, because people aren't gonna buy the new game, because if you're
8073040	8078440	gonna buy a game, which, you know, games stop me, decide, hey, you know what, we're not
8078440	8081680	gonna take it back because you can't erase this save game, granted, they haven't made
8081680	8086120	the decision permanently so far, they did at one time with Resident Evil, where they
8086120	8090180	said, oh, we're not gonna take it back, and then they changed that, but, you know, if,
8090180	8095480	if they do this, then, you know, a consumer that realizes, you know what, I'm gonna play
8095480	8099320	this game for a while, then I'm probably gonna get sick of it, and I'm gonna sell it, and
8099320	8104520	get some money for something else, if they can't sell it back, they may not buy it.
8104520	8108200	They're, you know what, I'll just, I'll just skip buying, and I'll, I'll wait until another
8108200	8110160	game comes out.
8110160	8117560	It's just, it's dumb, it's really a dumb idea, and it's, and why you should be limited, why
8117560	8122840	even at all games should be saved to the carts that they're on instead of your system.
8122840	8128480	Your 3DS, which has a goddamn SD card in it, every one comes with one.
8128480	8131880	Yeah, it's not even something you have to buy separately, like on most DSPs.
8131880	8138040	And you can save to that, I don't understand why you can't do that, and that's stupid.
8138040	8143220	You know, with the DS it made sense, because there was, there was no saving whatsoever
8143220	8150100	to the system, there was no storage of any sort whatsoever, but this is the 3DS.
8150100	8156520	Come on, jump into the century where, you know what, we can store data to these carts.
8156520	8161960	I mean, it's not like Namco could have heard what Capcom did and then made the decision.
8161960	8166640	Both of these companies made this conscious decision to design the saves this way months
8166640	8169520	ago, and that is weird to me.
8169520	8172880	It's almost like somebody put them up to it.
8172880	8175480	That's what strikes me as, like, just really weird.
8175480	8177800	But anyway, I hope this trend stops.
8177800	8182360	And yet again, another game, but this one, unlike the Capcom game, this was one I was
8182360	8186720	legitimately like, oh, I really do love Pac-Man Championship Edition, I wouldn't mind a portable
8186720	8189680	version of it, you know, if it was like 1999 maybe.
8189680	8194720	But now, nope, not gonna do it, because I'm not gonna support this type of game design.
8194720	8200040	So, even though I do tend to buy most of my games new, and I don't sell a lot of them
8200040	8201800	back, very rarely do I sell games back.
8201800	8206760	The last game I remember distinctly selling back was Top Spin 3.
8206760	8212800	And just a handful of, like, GameCube and old first generation Xbox 360 games.
8212800	8213800	So.
8213800	8218920	Anyhow, more news about the Xbox 360 anyway, since I brought it up there.
8218920	8224440	Free-to-play games apparently are inevitable on the Xbox 360, at least according to one
8224440	8225440	publisher.
8225440	8231080	Todd Harris of Hi-Rez Studios, who makes the game Tribes Ascend, it's a multiplayer first
8231080	8235680	person shooter coming to the PC, and hopefully someday the 360.
8235680	8239640	Todd Harris says, quote, at least from our conversations, both Sony and Microsoft are
8239640	8243320	moving there strategically, but there are still some things to be worked out on both
8243320	8249400	the business side and the technical side of the certification side, that's a tongue twister,
8249400	8251880	regarding frequency of patches.
8251880	8255680	And those issues just need further advancement before we would be comfortable putting a release
8255680	8257580	timeframe on the console version.
8257580	8261560	It's not the case of never, but we know all those things we can handle on the PC, so that's
8261560	8263120	why PC is first.
8263120	8264120	Interesting.
8264120	8267280	I remember hearing something about this, doesn't Microsoft limit you to the number of patches
8267280	8269440	you're able to do within the release?
8269440	8271680	I think so, I think you have to pay for that or something.
8271680	8279040	And maybe that's why the free-to-play games, well hell, any MMO tends to do a lot of frequent
8279040	8283160	updates, maybe that's the reservation they're having, which makes a lot of sense now.
8283160	8288040	To me, it's nice to kind of hear what the holdup is, and that makes sense now.
8288040	8293000	Although, shit, Final Fantasy XI, man, that game ended up being the exception to every
8293000	8298600	damn rule, because that game can patch whenever they want, because it runs through play online.
8298600	8300480	I found a copy at the thrift store today.
8300480	8301480	Did you really?
8301480	8304600	Like, the three release one.
8304600	8307120	Well, that's kind of dumb, because the code isn't going to work.
8307120	8309120	I know, but I thought it was funny.
8309120	8310400	Yeah, it is kind of funny.
8310400	8311400	And Half-Life 2.
8311400	8313480	That poor thrift store didn't know any better.
8313480	8314480	Yeah.
8314480	8316360	If someone's going to buy it and not know any better.
8316360	8318280	I know, that's the sad part.
8318280	8322880	Alright, and Brakeman comments in our chatroom at chat.orns.com, Xbox has already had
8322880	8325760	free-to-play games, 1 versus 100.
8325760	8326760	Too bad it didn't last.
8326760	8327760	Good point.
8327760	8332760	1 versus 100 wasn't an MMO, per se, but it was a free-to-play game, sure, it was Microsoft
8332760	8337580	backed, for one, but everybody, well, at least a lot of people I know miss it dearly.
8337580	8339280	It's not a freemium game, though.
8339280	8340280	True.
8340280	8344400	But you know, though, that Marvel's MMO is going to be free-to-play.
8344400	8345400	That's right, I remember hearing that.
8345400	8346400	With Deadpool.
8346400	8347400	But it's not going to be on 360.
8347400	8348400	No.
8348400	8349400	It's going to be a PC game.
8349400	8350400	Yeah, but still.
8350400	8351400	Yeah.
8351400	8353880	So, let's go to the mailbag.
8353880	8359200	Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read your emails.
8359200	8360200	Live here on air.
8360200	8364920	Actually, I've got to say this, live, this is really funny, just live, we had a little
8364920	8370640	net split live, and if you've ever been on IRC, you know what a net split is, and I guess
8370640	8375380	Loki's on one side of the net split and I'm on another, because I could see that Loki
8375380	8377720	just left the room.
8377720	8379960	It's me on an island with Black Wolf and Dark Tetsuya.
8379960	8381520	Oh, and everybody's back.
8381520	8382520	Oh, just reconnected.
8382520	8383520	There you go.
8383520	8384520	That's kind of funny.
8384520	8385520	All right.
8385520	8386520	Oh, internets.
8386520	8387520	You never cease to amaze me.
8387520	8388520	All right, let's move on.
8388520	8389520	Mailbag.
8389520	8390520	Open shop time.
8390520	8391520	Oh.
8391520	8392520	Oh yeah, mailbag that thing.
8392520	8393520	Well, we got two.
8393520	8394520	I'm going to double check and see if we got any more, real quick.
8394520	8395520	Nope, just two.
8395520	8396520	So, the first one.
8396520	8397520	Hey, guys.
8397520	8398520	Hey.
8398520	8399520	Just wondering, do you know of any smaller Xbox controllers?
8399520	8400520	The current ones are so big, and the way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons
8400520	8401520	are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way the
8401520	8423200	buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the
8423200	8431260	way the buttons are set up, the way the buttons are set up, the way
8431260	8435820	have to probably get a third-party controller and I think most of those are pretty soon.
8435820	8440700	Or a joystick. You could try one of those game pads like they put some out for Street Fighter 4,
8440700	8445340	the little game pads that came out, but I know Salacious Pop had a lot of problems with those.
8445340	8451660	Like he got one, he ordered it brand new out of the bag, broken. What about like, I mean,
8451660	8455740	I know she might be thinking smaller, but what about thinking bigger? Like what about an arcade
8455740	8461660	stick? That's what my suggestion was. I have, I've had hand surgery twice on my right hand, so it
8461660	8465900	gets really stiff really easily and my fingers will lock up because I still need to have one
8465900	8473180	other finger worked on. But, um, like for example, I can play Dragon Age 2 just fine because I use
8473180	8476540	my thumb and forefinger for a lot of stuff and neither of those are ones that have problems,
8476540	8481500	but I cannot play fighting games very well because I'm moving so fast and my hand will
8481500	8487340	start cramping up. So what I found is that using the joystick, you know, like we have the tournament
8487340	8493260	stick and we've got the Xbox joystick, which you can probably find at a used game store somewhere
8493260	8501340	for cheap. Um, I have no problem. So something like that will work. A situation like that is
8501340	8505180	tough too, because you really need to get your, no pun intended, you need to get your hands on
8505180	8509420	a controller to actually try it before you buy it. So I would really suggest you head out to
8509420	8514140	something where they tend to have those things out for you to try, like maybe Best Buy. Uh, I know
8514140	8518220	Fry's, but they're more west coast. Fry's always seems to have that kind of stuff out, at least the
8518220	8522460	arcade sticks, but I know they don't have those everywhere. Um, hopefully there's a store near
8522460	8526300	you. Maybe even an independent store might be a way to go where they would have some of that stuff
8526300	8531500	out for you to try it and see how your hand takes to that. By the way, speaking of the controllers
8531500	8536700	they have out at Fry's, they have a six button PlayStation controller that's not, it's, it's
8536700	8543900	third party but supported by PlayStation, by Sony that's super comfortable. So I mean, maybe see how
8543900	8549500	that likes it and see if the same distributor makes another pad like it, because I found that
8549500	8554140	to be really comfortable and it was just a six button fighting stick. I was playing, um, Super
8554140	8560860	Street Fighter IV with it at Fry's. Interesting. Yeah. So that was that email. And then the last
8560860	8568060	one, just two quick unrelated questions. Um, first off, is there an online multiplayer game that
8568060	8575180	varies the audio of voice chat or availability of text chat based on proximity? A character closer
8575180	8580620	to you would sound louder while players across the map couldn't be heard at all. I haven't gotten my
8580620	8584460	feet wet with it, but I suggest World of Warcraft would do something like this. Actually it does.
8584460	8588860	It does not, and the voice chat that's built into WoW kind of has a reputation for sucking.
8588860	8592780	They tried to build it so that people wouldn't have to get what's called ventrilo servers or
8592780	8598220	TeamSpeak some people use. Um, but folks tend to rely on the ventrilo servers. With characters
8598220	8605980	though? Actually your proximity does change with in-game, with NPCs. Yeah. But if your sound
8605980	8609980	drivers will support it. Right. But not other people. I think he's thinking like a person to
8609980	8613660	person game. You know what game comes to mind for me, to me for some reason is Halo. Didn't
8613660	8619740	Halo do that? Or specifically Halo 2 and 3 character. He's not saying, Oh, he said a
8619740	8627740	character. Yeah. Wow. Does that then? Yeah. Wow. Does that, um, wow. We'll also pan left to right,
8627740	8638860	depending on your sound card. Yeah. Um, I know that area noises in portal two and also the
8638860	8644140	loudspeaker in portal two based on where you are. The, um, the loudspeaker will project a
8644140	8647820	different way depending on the texture of the walls and where you are. Do you remember that?
8649020	8656300	So the echo will be different. Um, yeah. And when you're talking to, I don't care spoilers,
8656300	8662060	it's been out already. When you're talking to potatoes through the glass wall, um, she's a
8662060	8666780	little quieter than when you're actually right in front of her. So a lot more games are doing that,
8666780	8670620	but really a lot of it also has to do with your, with your sound card and, you know,
8670620	8675260	playing stereo versus mono. So, and then the second question real quick tiger call on our
8675260	8679420	chairman says they still use ventrilo ventrilo harassment comes to mind. Yeah. I've seen those
8679420	8685100	YouTube's interesting for the record on Star Trek online, which by the way also does the distance
8685100	8692300	based. Um, I use team speak and do any of that. It's just like ventrilo. Yeah. They're just
8692300	8696620	competing clients, but yeah. Oh yeah. Ventrilo is used by a lot of wow people. A lot of guilds
8696620	8703740	use ventrilo. It's really common. Any MMO with a big guild that does any type of group events,
8703740	8708540	you're going to find something like ventrilo team speak. One of those clients. I actually host a
8708540	8712700	ventrilo server for my private guild of friends for the record. I do prefer ventrilo versus team
8712700	8719820	speak. Me too. After having used them both. And I used team speak since February when I was playing,
8719820	8724620	um, February last year when I was playing Star Trek online. Okay. The second question, secondly,
8724620	8731340	assuming Jamie is on tonight's show, what tense is used in phrases such as will have happened?
8731340	8737980	And I do believe that is future perfect. Will have happened. When you're referring to anything
8738620	8746140	that will, that is a future event happening, but in that future point where it has already happened,
8746140	8751980	it's future perfect. Really? I thought we were a video game show. He asked. Fair enough. Um,
8751980	8758780	and that's from Robert M. Add it for the emails then. Yeah. If you want to get in on the email
8758780	8764140	bag, mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com. But now's the part of the show where we could rant
8764140	8774700	about lack of emails. If we would like. See you at the week.
8774700	8786380	Um, you know, I did have one at the beginning of the show and now for the life of me,
8786380	8793340	I can't remember what it is. So fuck you do not remember. You know, the memory is the first thing
8793340	8806300	you know. Hey Rob, what Loki, um, fuck you. The whole foods being too damn expensive.
8807020	8811500	Go to sunflower instead, all the same stuff and it's cheaper. There's some big cheese wheels that
8811500	8819500	I really wanted to buy. They're probably like $300. I like me my parm. Um, I don't really have
8819500	8824300	a whole lot of FUs. Things are, these are pretty good. Otherwise, um, FU to weekends not being
8824300	8828940	three days long. I'll do something a little silly like that. That's it for the FUs of the week.
8830540	8834380	Let's get back into some news. Loki. I'm not able to say that FU.
8836540	8842140	I get a three day weekend this weekend. Anyways, uh, let's talk. Let's talk about some more,
8842140	8850140	more, more, uh, retarded DRM. And you know, I'm saying that because it's Ubisoft and Ubisoft,
8850140	8855740	you would have thought, learned their lesson with, uh, the always on, uh, DRM that they had
8855740	8861820	with Assassin's Creed and stuff, but no, they're back with the always on Assassin's Creed type DRM
8861820	8869580	for Driver San Francisco. Um, yes, the PC version will require a permanent internet connection and,
8869580	8876700	um, no word if that's going to be loosened or not like it was with Assassin's Creed. Um, or I
8876700	8881900	believe Prince of Persia was the other game that used that. Um, of course the console version has
8881900	8887500	the stupid Uplay Passport now, the one time use code that will unlock multiplayer access. Thank
8887500	8894140	you Ubisoft. I get to play unlock or I get to play some multiplayer. How generous of you. Also
8894140	8901900	from dust is getting the Ubisoft DRM as well. Thanks Ubisoft. And, um, that kind of sucks.
8902860	8909900	Then, um, to kind of add a little bit of the icing on top of their stupid cake. Um,
8910620	8917420	they have come out, they have come out and said that, guess what? Our always on DRM is a success.
8917420	8925180	And it's a success and pissing everyone off. Yay. Basically it says, uh, Ubisoft has seen the clear
8925180	8931180	reduction in piracy of our titles, which required a persistent online connection. And, uh, from that
8931180	8936780	point of view, uh, the requirement is a success. That's because everyone went further underground
8936780	8941260	to get around your DRM. I mean, they really think that people aren't going to find a way around it
8941260	8948700	again. Here's the thing is, I don't know what exactly is considered a success because, yes,
8948700	8954620	less people are pirating your game, but you know what? The number of people pirating your game
8955580	8959900	before versus the number of people pirating your game now that you say it's reduced,
8959900	8965180	does that actually equal out to more sales? Because that those two numbers are independent
8965180	8969580	of each other. They have nothing to do with it. You know, whether people are interested in
8969580	8974780	downloading your game or not, you know, um, someone may not have been interested in downloading
8974780	8980460	Assassin's Creed 2 on PC or Splinter Cell Conviction on PC. Maybe they just didn't want
8980460	8988540	to pirate the game. You ever think of that? Um, and not to mention though that, uh, the previous
8988540	8998140	games, you know, the DRM was hacked within a few weeks anyways. So I wouldn't exactly go out and
8998140	9004540	shout at the top, you know, your lungs that it's a, you know, great success because all you're
9004540	9008700	really doing is affecting the people that legitimately buy the game and now they want to
9008700	9013180	play it offline or something like that, you know, play it in an area. Say you take your laptop with
9013180	9017660	you and you want to play it at, you know, a friend's house or something and you don't have open
9017660	9022940	wi-fi. Or say you're a serviceman overseas serving our country and you want to play a game to relax
9022940	9032700	on your break, you know. Can't do it. Can't do it. Thanks Ubisoft. So, yeah, it's stupid and...
9032700	9037020	How is that a success? That's offensive. The only people that this hurts is the people who
9037020	9041900	bought the game legitimately. That's who this hurts. Pirates will still get their game and
9041900	9048140	you're an idiot if you don't think they won't. I mean, because the PSP is unhackable, right?
9048140	9055580	Yeah. And, you know, I remember when they... It did get, you know, cracked almost, you know,
9055580	9062540	pretty quickly. So, here's the thing. If you're using, and I'm gonna assume it's the same scheme
9062540	9070380	as before, it's gonna be cracked even faster. So, all that's... Who's gonna win in that? The pirates.
9070380	9075100	Because they don't have your crappy DRM anymore. What's this about? They denied the rumored cracks?
9075100	9081820	Oh, this was back in March. They had, of course, their new DRM and I want to say it was for...
9081820	9087020	I'm trying to remember which game it was. It wasn't... Maybe it was Assassin's Creed 2, but there was
9087020	9095820	another game that they had coming out as well. I guess they... It says, pirated copies of various PC
9095820	9100220	games from Ubisoft are apparently making the rounds online, sparking allegations that the DRM
9100220	9105900	has already been defeated. And, of course, Ubisoft spokesman reported to Edge, saying this rumor is
9105900	9112620	false and while pirated version may seem to be complete at startup, any gamer who downloads and
9112620	9117820	plays the cracked version will find that the version is not complete. Yeah, not complete in the
9117820	9122060	fact that you don't get... I don't know what it was that they didn't get access to, but it was
9122060	9126700	something really stupid. Like, oh, you don't get... You don't get access to our wonderful customer
9126700	9133100	service. You don't get the Uplay features. Hooray. Yeah, something like download content or something
9133100	9137900	like that. Yeah, oh no, I can't download download content through your service. I guess I'll have to
9137900	9146140	pirate that too. It'll be cracked. You watch. Because people love, especially now that they've
9146140	9152860	come out and said, oh, it was a success. Whoosh! You just thrown gasoline on the fire, you dumbass.
9152860	9160220	Alright, well, speaking of adding fuel to the fire, there's obviously a lot of pissed off people
9160220	9167020	that Mega Man Legends 3 got cancelled. What does the internet love? Petitions! So, an activist group
9167020	9172780	has called themselves 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3. They're trying to get
9172780	9178940	100,000 members and they are trying to get them all on their Facebook page. So, you can go over
9178940	9184220	there and like them if you are so inclined. Not exactly. They are doing that, but there's
9185180	9190460	an actual official petition which you have to do is sign up for the Dev Room stuff for the Mega Man
9190460	9195740	Legends 3 project and you sign up there and then you go to the forums and you make a comment and
9195740	9199420	a thread. Well, it also wouldn't surprise me if people are just trying to reach out however they
9199420	9205020	can. Yeah, it's basically that's how they're doing it right now. I signed up for it and did all that
9205020	9210140	stuff just because, you know, I'd like to play Mega Man Legends 3 and, you know, I'm not going to
9211180	9215420	beg them to release it, but I'll support the movement, I guess. Well, right now they're up
9215420	9222380	to 36,428. So, they're about a third of the way there. So, we'll see what happens. So, I mean,
9222380	9227340	no word on what happens when they hit 100,000. I mean, Capcom hasn't said. Capcom will go,
9227340	9233580	thanks for your support. Capcom will say, wow, that's 100,000 people that aren't getting this
9233580	9239500	game still. That's 100,000 people that we should market another upcoming game to. You know you
9239500	9244140	want to play Dead Rising 2. One of the things that, you know, was on there for their little
9244140	9249980	catchphrase was Legends Never Die or something like that. And so, Capcom, they had some DLC or
9249980	9254940	whatever for costumes for like Marvel versus Capcom 3, which, by the way, doesn't have any
9254940	9261180	Mega Man in it at all. I mean, Tron Bon, right? Well, but that's not Mega Man. Tron Bon's in
9261180	9266460	there. So, we love the Mega Man Legends series, but there's no Mega Man characters at all. So,
9266460	9270140	they put in there, you know, oh, there's alternate DLC because Legends Never Die,
9270140	9272220	and neither does like fashion or something like that. It's like...
9274380	9277660	I know that's literally Capcom giving the finger to that group.
9280380	9286300	Oh, God. It was like, oh, I gotta find the Facebook thing now. You know it was some intern
9286300	9291740	that wrote the little text there, and they were trying to get around the man that's holding them
9291740	9296780	down there, the management, and try to throw him a support, but it just comes off the wrong way.
9296780	9301420	Oh, I really need to find that quote because it was high-larious.
9301420	9305180	High-larious. Well, while you find that, let's go to Dark Sakura. I think he has some more
9305180	9309500	high-larious stuff for us. By the way, the Skype line is coming up as well as your Twitter topics
9309500	9317740	in just a little bit. Oh, oh, oh. This is... It's kind of... You know how people are always
9317740	9322620	finding little Easter eggs in games much later after the games have been out? You know, sort of
9322620	9333020	like the blowing on the Famicon speaker to make the Pulse voice disappear and all that? Apparently,
9333020	9349900	Bomberman will eat your dust and lick your crack. These were sound files... These were
9350940	9356540	sound files hidden in the 1997 game Atomic Bomberman, which was the first Bomberman
9356540	9362380	game made for Windows and the second Bomberman that came out on a home computer. But it has,
9362380	9366620	I'm so fucking proud of you, I could just shit. You should play that one. That one's great.
9368460	9373020	If I can find it. I am so fucking proud of you, I could just shit.
9376860	9383340	And then there's like... Eat my dust and lick my crack. There's like, oh, my ass. And there's
9383340	9390220	one that says, I'll slap you down and shit. That's right there, tits. The one after that
9390220	9396700	is a little funnier. You're fucked. No, I mean, there's like multiple sounds. That's right there,
9396700	9403180	sweet tits. That's right there, tits. That's right there, tits. You're talking to me, shit heel.
9405580	9409900	This would be a great soundboard for L.R. Talk to the fist because the face is pissed.
9411500	9414940	Next time Loki and I get in an argument about Nintendo, Dark Soccer could just say,
9414940	9421100	would you guys cut out this macho shit and hurry up? Yeah, don't make me come out there
9421100	9429420	and stomp both of your asses. I also like my ass is killing me, I need help. My ass is killing me,
9429420	9437340	I need help. The one after that's funny too. That's really funny in like a second grade way.
9437340	9442300	Oh, fuck me.
9447900	9449980	Oh, fuck me.
9453020	9455340	They're going to put out Mega Man Legends 3 after all.
9458780	9463100	I will tell you something about this, though, is that you could actually go into the sound files
9463100	9469100	in the game and make your own vocal macros for the game. Nice. So I think, I mean, I don't see
9469100	9474140	why this is reported on now, except that, you know, I think it's fucking funny. Time for a
9474140	9481180	fucking dirt nap. Sounds kind of like Bugs Bunny saying that. That's kind of funny that they made
9481180	9485020	all these really sick things they were just never found, you know. I like the last one. You talking
9485020	9494540	to me, shit heel? You talking to me, shit heel? Oh, fuck me. I like, I'll break your fucking head
9494540	9503980	with a ratchet. That one's great too. Xenocorn chat says, sounds like the jerky boys did the
9503980	9509340	audio. Yeah, kind of. It's kind of what it sounds like. These are the, well, you know, another game
9509340	9513420	had unused voice clips and I actually, I was reading a little bit more about this. It's not
9513420	9519020	a story that kind of has something, you know. Did you know in Portal 2, what's his name that did
9519020	9523180	Cave Johnson? I can never remember his name. I know who he is, but I can never remember his name.
9523180	9527980	The guy from Spider-Man. Yeah. He would, he refused to do certain lines because it sounded
9527980	9533740	too much like a rape scene. Yeah, I read that this week. And I had posted something about it on my
9533740	9541420	Tumblr, but you can find Ellen's lines, who was the voice of GLaDOS and Carolyn saying, no, I
9541420	9546860	don't want this. You know, basically, but there was one line that I wish they would have recorded
9546860	9553020	because I would love to hear it. It's after she gets put in GLaDOS says, I'm awake and I'm going
9553020	9561180	to kill you all. So. Okay. I found that actual, that quote, and it was from the DLC for Super
9561180	9567660	Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. It says, all alternate costumes for Guile, Blanca, Dalsim,
9567660	9572940	Genn, and Feilong are included in this pack. Show everyone that legends never die and never go out
9572940	9578700	of fashion. And to which, you know, the hundred thousand strongs, uh, for bringing back, maybe
9578700	9585740	a legendary ego. Seriously? Seriously? And the chat room is lighting up a minute and a half later
9585740	9592540	because of the buffer. JK Simmons is who you're trying to think of. Yes. All right. Insolacious
9592540	9600380	Pop says he's fucking hot. All right. Uh, moving on a couple more stories for you guys. And then
9600380	9607980	the Skype line at 1 877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. Yes. Sony soon
9607980	9613980	enough will be saying, show me on the doll where they touched you. Uh, cause they actually have
9613980	9620780	patented some creepy looking doll thing. And I don't know if this was the crying baby out of the
9620780	9627420	PlayStation 3 commercials or what, but apparently the patent was filed back in 2008. Uh, it's only
9627420	9634700	been, uh, recently been publicized. Um, it's a plush toy that's, um, packing, I guess like a
9634700	9640540	wireless receiver, uh, means for reading storage medium and even a processor along with both USB
9640540	9647020	and ethernet ports. It would be act as some sort of buddy for kids who can pop a disc into their
9647020	9652780	PS3 and have the console communicate with it, telling it to act surprised or its arms up or a
9652780	9662460	certain point, you know, certain points during gameplay or viewing or whatever. Um, weird and
9662460	9668700	creepy looking. Wasn't there a controller like on the Wii for some type of game that was a doll and
9668700	9674220	you put the Wii mode up its butt and yeah, there's two games. Yeah. Yes. That sounds like kind of
9674220	9679100	two games. Oh my. There's my baby. Well actually it was funny cause I think one evolved into the
9679100	9686700	other. There was, um, My Baby and Me. I think it was, uh, from 505 Games and that came out in
9686700	9692540	Europe. I don't know if that came out over here, but we got Babysitting Mama also developed by the
9692540	9697020	same studio that put out My Baby and Me. But the baby was actually cute, not disturbing looking
9697020	9702300	like that picture. Yeah. Well the, to be fair though, they did have a, it was a holster that
9702300	9707580	you could put on your baby so you could holster the remote that way instead of shoving it up its
9707580	9713020	ass. Um, this thing is kind of creepy, but I could see, you know, some interesting implementations
9713020	9719420	to that. Say you jailbreak your PS3. The PS3 can send a kill signal to the doll and stop
9720300	9724780	and they can attack you in your sleep. Play fun pranks on all your family.
9724780	9731740	I'm reminded that one Halloween episode of, uh, the Simpsons where it was like,
9731740	9735420	I'm Christie the clown and I'm going to kill you. It's a little dolly.
9738060	9743820	Uh, it is creepy though. Would you play a game that involved a doll as a peripheral Loki?
9745500	9749500	Would it have to be murder dolls or something like that? I don't know. It would have to be fun.
9750620	9754140	All right, one more story for you guys and then we'll get to the Skype line. This is about
9754140	9759580	connectimals. Uh, guess what was announced? A sequel of sorts to connectimals. You can think
9759580	9765900	of it as connectimals plus or more formally connectimals now with bears. Yes, that is
9765900	9770860	exactly the name of a connectimals now with bears. Uh, it's, I guess there's going to be
9770860	9777580	download content called bear Island and you'll be able to download this for $15. And, uh, well, no,
9777580	9781820	it's not those types of bears. Not like the kind that were at Folsom street fair, but I like those
9781820	9786220	bears. Well, these, well, I like Panda bears and that's the types of bears you're going to see in
9786220	9792620	this. Yeah. So there you go. Uh, I don't know. They say five different types of bears that are
9792620	9797420	going to be in it. Um, they do have some pictures. I don't, I saw a polar bear. I don't think,
9797420	9803820	is that a koala? Kinda. Let me see. Let me see. My favorite is the box art. Cause it just looks
9803820	9809340	like they totally just photoshopped in the little Panda there. Um, let's see. I'm trying to see if
9809340	9814380	we have any koalas. That's definitely a polar bear polar bear polar bears are in there. There's
9814380	9819820	a black bear and a Brown bear and I think a Brown bear climbing a tree. So I don't think they have
9819820	9826460	koalas. No, you're thinking of the wrong game. I'd like to mention though, Jamie, I made that joke
9826460	9833980	about a month ago on my Twitter. What? Oh really? Oh, you, Oh, you made that joke a month ago and
9833980	9838780	now they just announced it officially. Interesting. How funny. Cause I put Microsoft is releasing
9838780	9842220	connectables plus bears. So if I followed you on Twitter, I would have known about the bears.
9842220	9848460	I sure hope that the animal type of bear, not the big hairy gay kind, but you know what? I would
9848460	9855580	play that game too. Anyhow, you can download the download content for 15 bucks or there'll be a
9855580	9862540	new retail release called connectables now with bears. Grr. There you go. That does it for the
9862540	9866860	news tonight. We're going to go to the Skype line. It is open now at one eight seven seven
9866860	9871660	game O L R or our username on Skype is orange launch radio. You can call us right now and we
9871660	9875580	will talk about whatever you want to talk about. Any news stories tonight or what have you.
9875580	9880940	Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, let's go to the Twitter and get some tweets to read here in
9880940	9884540	between the waiting for some phone calls. Another screen capture. I'm going to put it in the chat
9884540	9891260	room. God, what'd you find? Do I want to know? It's just, it's just a couple of bears. Oh yeah,
9891260	9900060	probably gay bears, right? Wearing assless chaps. Nice, but they have cute little ears.
9900060	9903900	Can I go to the Twitter while we wait for some calls again? One eight seven seven game O L R
9903900	9908380	your username on Skype is orange launch radio. 13 X forever tweets us. So what do you guys think
9908380	9914220	about the group coaster by Taito for iOS? Well, I guess we said at the top of the show, but a plus
9914220	9920060	well done, right? Dark Sakura. And hopefully you'll give it a try this week. I meant to
9920060	9922940	download it. I just haven't gotten a chance to. All right. We got a call coming in. Hi,
9922940	9927580	you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's CD thunder. Hey, what's up CD thunder.
9929020	9932060	Not much. I have a couple of things I want to discuss. All right. What?
9934140	9938940	The two newest games that are out Duke Nukem forever and LA noir. Yes. What about them?
9940300	9943100	Well, I like to start with the Duke Nukem forever. Please do.
9943100	9951580	Well, first off, yeah, I agree with what you're saying that graphics aren't really that great.
9952540	9961900	And, um, but it's still, Duke still has his, um, sarcasm that's made it, that's made the games
9961900	9968060	great over the years. And, and only in this could, and only in this game could you kick a
9968060	9973260	monster's eyeball and consider it a field goal. So you kind of like the potty humor in it. I mean,
9973260	9977820	there's no shame in that potty humor is funny once in a while. There you go.
9979580	9985500	I mean, but what about, uh, what's up with the girls giving him a blowjob in the very beginning?
9986860	9993180	Because he's Duke. Yeah. And they're acting in the game and they're acting like he's actually
9993180	9997500	playing it and he's got the controller and everything. Because what they're trying to do is
9997500	10004140	like, imagine this is you. Yeah. Hot chicks giving you a BJ while you're playing this game.
10004140	10008140	Awesome. Isn't that awesome? Yeah, I actually wouldn't mind that.
10009180	10012700	Exactly. There you go. Point made. That's some pre-order bonus right there.
10017340	10020620	Maybe more people would have bought the game if they gave that away as a pre-order.
10020620	10029420	To pre-order the game and we'll suck your dick. Yeah. Hey. All right. Anyhow, what was the other
10029420	10035420	game you wanted to say about not Duke Nukem? Uh, you said, um, LA noir. LA noir. Ah, yes.
10035420	10042620	What do you think of LA noir? I actually like it. It's, um, I like how it's set in the 40,
10042620	10046700	in the forties and everything with all the classic cars and everything. But I,
10046700	10052380	I, it's not really set. You could tell it's not a complete forties game because they
10052380	10059260	usually don't use that language, all the F words and stuff. But besides that, it's really,
10059260	10063340	it looks really fun. So the F is for fun in this game.
10064380	10070700	Uh. All right. Forget it. Well, I, well, I mean, you know, this game's, the thing is,
10070700	10074940	if you like the toilet humor in Duke Nukem Forever, my understanding is that you get
10074940	10082540	full on beaver in LA noir. So I mean, it might be a dead chick, but still she's still warm.
10082540	10088540	Yeah. I mean, I like how it integrates where you have to interview the person and you have
10088540	10094460	to figure out on your own if they're lying or if they're acting doubtful or if they're
10094460	10099260	flat out telling a lie. Yeah. And from what I understand in the game, when you
10099260	10102060	guess correct, or like, you know, you have to guess if they're telling the truth or lying
10102060	10105020	and then a little chime sounds, right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10105020	10108540	Well, what they should do is they should, instead of like just a dumb little chime that
10108540	10112460	should sound, you should get rewarded with more pussy shots. Don't you think?
10113260	10118220	Yeah. And if you get it wrong, you have to look at that bear picture of the Dark
10118220	10121340	Soccer just posted in chat. If you're not, they should just like, uh,
10121340	10125180	edit it, like have a little, uh, blur there or something, maybe.
10125180	10129340	There you go. There you go. All right. Well, anything else on your mind tonight, CD Thunder?
10129340	10135740	Oh, let's see. What other games are on your radar to play soon?
10137660	10143100	Um, I haven't actually played those two. I just mentioned, I was just looking at play through
10143100	10149500	something, but, um, I haven't been able to listen to you guys lately because I've been working,
10149500	10154860	but I'm glad I've been able to tonight. You guys have made my evening and rock on.
10154860	10159740	Don't forget. There is always the podcast. You can take us with you in your pocket every week.
10160860	10163900	All right. Did you say something? I couldn't hear you.
10163900	10167980	Yeah. Just plug in the podcast. That's all right. OrangeLunchRadio.com. More information.
10167980	10172220	You can take us in your pocket with you and listen to us whenever you want. Not just Sunday nights.
10172220	10175420	All right. CD Thunder, thanks so much for the call and enjoy the potty humor.
10175420	10177180	Hee hee poop poop. All right. Thanks. Bye.
10177180	10181020	Bye. All right. Uh, let's go to another call since our phone's ringing off the hook. Hi,
10181020	10184380	you're on Orange Lunch Radio. Who's this? Let me turn down my computer. Hey,
10184380	10186620	this is Sky Judo. Hey, Sky Judo. What's on your mind?
10186620	10190860	And I just have, uh, one thing I want to mention and then I want to go into a game.
10190860	10195020	All right. Um, when you guys are talking about the killer dolls, do you remember, um,
10195020	10200060	a couple of years ago, the news report where the, um, they had like these cabbage patch dolls that
10200060	10203820	if you, I guess you hold like a spoon up to their mouth or something and they would chew
10203820	10206300	and they were actually like eating little girls' hairs at night.
10206300	10210860	Yes. I remember that. Yes. They had to like fix those dolls because yes,
10210860	10213660	like some girl got their hair caught in it or something, right?
10213660	10218060	Yeah. A lot of girls. I mean the, um, the news report had me cracking up because like if you're
10218060	10222460	a fan of horror movies, you know, there's always like some type of instruction on how to kill the
10222460	10225020	monster. Hilarious.
10225020	10228860	Yeah. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. So on the news, they actually had
10228860	10233100	instructions on what you would have to do if you caught the cabbage, the cabbage patch doll
10233660	10237740	eating your kid late at night. Like you had to twist the head off and there was like this whole
10237740	10242540	ritual that you had to do. It was great. That sounds awesome.
10242540	10246540	I would have just gotten a pair of scissors. There was actually like four main things they
10246540	10251260	tell you to do to like dismantle the doll before I ate your kid. It's great.
10251260	10256620	Oh my God. That's awesome. And yeah, don't feed the dolls after midnight and not leave them in
10256620	10261100	direct sunlight. Yeah. You gotta leave that story and read it.
10261100	10263820	Yeah. I'll leave that story. What's the game you want to talk about?
10264700	10269340	It's a card game actually. I know everyone on all games is, uh, you know, they're like
10269340	10273660	ready to rip their hair out because I've been calling every show talking about it.
10273660	10277740	Now it's our turn now. We're the last show of the week. So it's our turn, right?
10277740	10283900	You, you guys have to try Yogi. Look at this game up, man. It's, it's a fucking awesome game.
10283900	10289740	Yogi like the bear or the brand of tea. Well, um, it comes from some type of a
10289740	10293500	Japanese saying it means to read. Like it's supposed to read your opponent's mind or
10293500	10297260	something, you know, some, it has some kind of mystical kind of crap.
10297260	10300860	So you're not, you're not talking about like a card based video game. You're talking about
10300860	10305740	like actual table and cards. I'm down with that. Like one of my favorite games ever is
10305740	10310460	Millborn. It's a French game. That's cards. And it's like cars racing. It's a lot of fun.
10310460	10313100	And I know that tons of people are going to magic. Those are all cards.
10313100	10318380	Yeah. Uh, you need to Google this game, uh, Google Yomi, uh, Yomi. And, uh, the website
10318380	10323980	is, uh, Serlin games. That's like what you can get the info on the game. And then, uh,
10323980	10328780	there's also a, um, a website that allows you to play the game for free against either
10328780	10333260	computer or other places so you can get a hang of it. But I re I recommend it. It's
10333260	10339820	like, um, the guy with the Yomi Yomi. What? Oh, not Yogi. I was thinking Yogi bear.
10340860	10345740	All right. So Yomi. Okay. Got it. The guy who, uh, the guy who invented it, he, uh,
10345740	10350700	he's some type of, um, high ranking, like street fighter player. Like he's done a few of those,
10350700	10355180	whatever the hell you call them. Oh, this is kind of interesting. This looks like I'm looking at all
10355180	10362380	the cards. The artwork looks very nice. Uh, yeah, I'm on this. It's Serlin games.com apparently
10362380	10366860	sells this. It's the Japanese word for reading and reading the mind of your opponent. It's competitive
10366860	10370380	card game that simulates a battle between two characters. It was like a fighting game,
10370380	10376860	but a card game. Interesting. It's great. And what I like about it best is, um, it's not technically
10376860	10382460	a trading card game. Like as once you, there's like a set amount of cards that you get and that's
10382460	10386380	it. It's like, you don't have to collect any more cards. There aren't any like rare cards that you
10386380	10391420	have to go out looking for and spending tons of money on. It's just a complete card game.
10391420	10395340	You know, what else is interesting about this is that I noticed every card has traditional
10395340	10400860	card stamps on it. Like the Dodge card can substitute as a three of hearts and the flame
10400860	10406940	arrow is a Jack of spades. Like that's, that's interesting to me that they, yeah, every character
10406940	10411820	is a, uh, is a deck you could actually use as a deck of playing cards. Huh? It comes with a
10411820	10417420	complete, I guess, what is it? 52 playing cards deck. Yeah. Yeah. So that's pretty much the game
10417420	10421820	in a nutshell. All right. Where can I buy this at Walmart or do I have to get it online? Uh,
10421820	10427660	well there's a, um, there's a download version that you can, um, I think it's like 1495. Uh,
10427660	10431100	you can add, it's called an employee where I guess you just print it out from your printer.
10431100	10435420	Oh wow. Uh, you get little card sleeves and you can play it that way. Or you can go
10436060	10439740	the super expensive route and get it for like a hundred bucks to complete game.
10440300	10444460	Yeah, I'll take the cheap route. No, but I, I, I did the battle and it's,
10444460	10448060	I'm not going to take up all your time, but I did the math on it because it looked pretty expensive.
10448060	10453420	But when you do the math on it, like if you buy the deck separately, um, each deck comes with two
10453420	10459020	characters. You're getting like decks of playing cards and that's like $24 in change. So if you've
10459020	10462780	bought them loosely, you actually be paying a little bit more than what you put a full game.
10462780	10466060	So it's not, it's not entirely. You know what though? A hundred bucks
10466060	10469180	doesn't seem so bad when you consider how much I spent on magic back in the day.
10470460	10475580	So the website to play it online free, I'll put it in the chat room, but you need to try that.
10475580	10479340	All right. Oh, that I can do free. I like that word. You should have started with that. All
10479340	10486780	right. All right. Thanks so much for the call and for the heads up on a new game later. All right.
10487500	10490620	I want to do tweets, but we keep getting calls and, and I definitely want to hear
10490620	10493100	what the callers have to say. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
10493900	10497340	No guys. It's Zina Corp. Hey Casey, how you doing? Hey Zina Corp. How you doing?
10498060	10501660	You know, just keeping it real. How are you keeping it real?
10502780	10506300	But by going to court, you know, long story. Wow. I'll talk about that.
10506300	10509740	Good luck with that. I hope it's not Judge Judy presiding. She can be kind of mean.
10510300	10514460	Yeah, that's true. It's kind of a rough. Well, good luck. Well, what's on your mind?
10514460	10516860	Happier thoughts. Video games. Take our mind off of that.
10517420	10524700	Good Lord. Video games. I tried getting back into some games that I passed over because I wasn't
10524700	10530460	sure how far their reach would be, but since I've been on YouTube for the past two months,
10530460	10535420	almost nonstop, I finally decided to try out both of the, uh, defense of the agent clones,
10535420	10539660	legends of, uh, what league of legends and the heroes of new earth.
10540460	10542940	League of legends. Yep. I know those games. What'd you think?
10545180	10550700	I guess it depends on the time of the day you're there. Like, especially it seems that these games
10550700	10555580	took off more in Europe than they did here. So while you're still getting European players,
10555580	10560540	everything's calm, you know, when you're in a newbie room and they're actually newbies playing
10560540	10564140	and if there's some more experienced players actually trying to help the people learn,
10564140	10569020	but the moment the afternoon comes up and all the US comes up, uh, it's pretty much like,
10569020	10571660	get the hell out you noob left and right. It's ridiculous.
10571660	10576140	See, I hate that shit. Like, I wish games had a better structure for noobs how to play.
10576140	10580540	You know, one game I randomly played this week, I forgot to mention in my top of the week was
10580540	10584060	Starcraft 2. I just randomly was like, I want to play Star Jeweled again because I love the
10584060	10587980	Star Jeweled add-on. That like made that game 10 times better. And you know, part of me was like,
10587980	10591820	I should learn how to play like real Starcraft and then go online and play. But then I'm like,
10591820	10596700	no, I'm too scared because there's no, like, there's nobody like me. Everybody that plays
10596700	10599260	Starcraft online is already really good and wah.
10600380	10605340	Yes, that's the truth. I tried getting back into a game here and of course I'm still in the Bronze
10605340	10611100	League, but now Bronze League is quite seasoned. So you really have no hope. You got to play your
10611100	10615260	buddies and that's it. That's about the only way to do it. What do you think about some of the
10615260	10619580	upcoming Defense of the Angels? Like there's a Blizzard Dota is coming to Starcraft 2 speaking
10619580	10624220	of which, and then we have actual Dota 2 from Valve soon.
10624940	10629660	I'm not holding my breath. The game is not going to change at all. I mean, it's good. It's going
10629660	10635100	to play almost exactly the same. Even like with Heroes of Newerth and League of Legends, the only
10635100	10640780	thing they really change is how the functionality of the game and it's switching from one to the
10640780	10645260	other is painful. You get set up for the way one game works and it messes you up for the other. So
10645260	10647420	you pretty much got to pick your flavor and stick with it.
10647420	10650460	So who do you think will walk away victorious at the end of the day, Blizzard, Valve,
10650460	10653500	or one of these other games? I hope they all drop to tell you the truth.
10653500	10658540	They need to work on something more original. Touché.
10658540	10663980	Hey, I told that to a Blizzard headhunter while I was in school. It's like I called them out on
10663980	10670700	it. It's like, why does Warcraft 3 play like Warcraft 2 and Starcraft? And he did it. Yeah,
10670700	10676380	everybody was there like, because they sell gazillions. That's why they all play the same.
10676380	10681260	Yeah, exactly. Because it's the same damn game. And I heard he actually wanted to talk to me
10683900	10688940	after the headhunter briefing he was doing at the school, but I think I already left in disgust. So
10688940	10693420	I didn't get a chance to give it to him directly. Who knows? I might've missed out on a job.
10695020	10701340	Nice. Well, good luck. I hope maybe you'll get a second shot with Blizzard at some point. Don't
10701340	10705900	mention that all the games are the same. Also, I got one final thing for you. Has
10705900	10712140	anybody seen the Comic-Con coverage for the Star Wars MMO?
10713580	10720300	Not extensively. I haven't been really watching this carefully. I'm kind of just waiting for when
10720300	10724700	the game gets really closer to release, but I know a lot did come out of Comic-Con.
10724700	10728940	Yeah. Based off what I saw, because they had actually, they showed the first part of an
10728940	10735820	instance adventure. And any wild head that played this game, I don't think you're really going to
10735820	10740540	see any difference. I see based off what I saw in the video, I mean, it's up on YouTube now,
10741180	10747420	but based off that footage, you still have the same tropes. You still have the same
10748380	10752540	player classes, the same structure. That's what I heard is that it's so well with
10752540	10756860	Star Wars laid over it. And I was really hoping for a little bit more. Where can I find that video?
10756860	10762220	Uh, it's on YouTube. Let me, I'll see if I can dig up the link for you and put it in chat.
10762220	10764940	Okay Ed, do that for me and I'll check it out here in a minute.
10764940	10770300	Yeah man. That's pretty much all I had. I'd say wait until you see more footage
10770300	10773500	on the game before you make an adjustment to do the initial investment.
10773500	10777420	Well, you know, we'll see how much it is and I definitely won't get that collector's edition,
10777420	10781420	but you never know. Especially if they cut the price as fast as they did on Rift,
10781420	10783980	I definitely have no excuse not to check it out.
10783980	10787260	Yeah, but this LucasArts stuff, they're not cutting that price anytime soon.
10787260	10791260	That's true. All right Xenocore, we're going to let you go buddy so we get more calls. Take care.
10791260	10792860	All right. I'll take that link for you. Take care.
10792860	10798620	Thanks. Bye. 1877 game OLR or username on Skype is orange launch radio if you'd like to get through.
10798620	10801660	Let's do some more tweets while we wait for at least one more call to come through here.
10802220	10807820	Kibben project tweets us sensationalism go. Sad as it is, if he felt pains in his chest,
10807820	10811660	he should have called an ambulance then and there. You might know what story is coming.
10811660	10817260	It's a link to a story about death by Xbox. That's the headline from The Sun.
10817260	10820060	Gotta love it. I wonder whose phone they hacked to get that headline.
10820780	10828700	Game addict 20 killed by deep vein thrombosis. Apparently a 20-year-old died from a blood clot
10828700	10834700	because he played his Xbox for up to 12 hours at a time. And his parents, of course, were stunned
10834700	10839980	by it saying, quote, as a parent, you think playing computer games can't do them any harm
10839980	10843980	because you know what they are doing. Kids all over the country are playing these games for
10843980	10849660	long periods. They don't realize it could kill them. I mean, 12 hours at a time, though,
10850620	10856620	shouldn't you? It's a parent sessive. That was not a good way to do it. That's the parents
10856620	10864540	not interfering and saying, hey, you need to slack off. Yeah. So maybe, um, your kid was obsessive
10864540	10870380	and you should have put a stop to it. That too. There is that. All right. Uh, let's see,
10870380	10875740	going on to more tweets. Uh, Roboditya Knight tweets us saying, hi, OLR. Have any of you played
10875740	10880620	Action 52 for the NES? This is another one of those multi-cart games, isn't it? I don't think
10880620	10884460	I have. Let me look it up real quick. I want to see what this is. Does that sound familiar,
10884460	10889180	Dark Soccer? You, you've, you know, a lot of the old school stuff. Yeah, but I never played
10889180	10895740	multi-carts. I'm assuming it is. Just from like ROM sets, but I haven't really played it because
10895740	10899020	why bother playing a multi-cart when you can play the actual game? I am actually looking at the
10899020	10904940	multi-cart. It did come out in 91 and then it was also out in 93 for Genesis consoles. They say a
10904940	10909580	lot of the titles had major glitches in it. Let me get to the next call. We'll talk more about this
10909580	10914460	in a minute. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hey, it's Strelok. Hey, Strelok,
10914460	10921820	what's up, buddy? Uh, not much. Uh, just wanted to, uh, say well played Nintendo. Well played.
10921820	10926220	Ah, I was hoping somebody would call in on this. What did you think about all this Nintendo news
10926220	10934780	this week? Um, it's both. You can tell it, you know, they were desperate because the 3DS hasn't
10934780	10939340	really been selling well because they really should have waited like another year. Or at
10939340	10947100	least until the holidays. Yeah, um, but at the same time, the way they did it was just fucking
10947100	10955820	genius because everybody wins. People who are, have waited, which is probably a lot of people
10955820	10962860	because, you know, people are waiting for your actual games to come out and, uh, you know,
10962860	10968620	and for like a price drop. And, you know, people who have already bought the system,
10968620	10974620	you know, they're getting 20 free games and some exclusive stuff. So, you know,
10974620	10982860	it's good for everybody. And also it's really good for Nintendo because, um,
10985420	10993180	they've really made sure by doing this that the 3DS is probably going to be, end up being the,
10993180	10997500	uh, number one Christmas gift this year with the price drop. You know,
10997500	11001340	I could see though, to be fair, as much as I, I pretty much agree with you on all these points,
11001340	11005500	I, I, to be fair, I could see where somebody could still be pissed off at Nintendo because
11005500	11009340	maybe these 20 years, maybe Virtual Console just isn't really interesting to them. Or,
11009340	11012860	you know, they already bought them all on the Wii, so they don't really want them on the,
11012860	11017580	uh, 3DS. It's kind of like $80, you know, that's still a steep cut.
11018220	11020860	You're getting free stuff. I mean, they, they could have just gone,
11020860	11027660	uh, yeah, we're not going to, you know, we're not going to throw you a bone and look at Apple.
11028380	11032620	Yeah. It's just the price of being an early adopter. And that's not even like,
11032620	11036060	that's not even just with the 3DS. That's with like games in general. Dude,
11036060	11040380	Loki just mentioned the price of Duke Nukem Forever dropped already. That game is maybe
11040380	11046220	two months old, you know, and you didn't get nothing for free, no free hats for being an
11046220	11051900	early adopter. So, I mean, this is just the nature of the beast. Yeah. But I, I think it's, uh,
11054140	11059020	I thought it was brilliant that they put the spin on it that they did because,
11060780	11066700	yeah, it was a desperate act, but it's going to, I think it's really going to save them in the
11066700	11073660	long run because, you know, like eventually, like, well, the, like the DS launch was kind
11073660	11078860	of shitty too. That didn't have very many good games for a while. That's true. But look at it
11078860	11086220	now. The thing it had going for it most of all was the Mario 64 port that was on it. Yeah. But
11086220	11092700	now it's the best selling handheld, like pretty much ever. I mean, like the original Game Boy,
11092700	11098380	but it's, it's, it's doing well. It is. All right. Well, any other thoughts on your mind
11098380	11104220	tonight before we let you go? Um, yeah, I'll crack your head with a fucking ratchet.
11105420	11111260	Gee, thanks. All right, buddy. Thanks for the call. All right. Later. I wish I still had that
11111260	11116460	soundboard up. I would have played something in response to that. It's on our Tumblr. I just,
11116460	11119500	I don't have the Tumblr up. All right. That's going to do it for the calls tonight. We got
11119500	11122860	to get through the rest of these tweets. Thank you guys for calling tonight. Sorry,
11122860	11126460	if you didn't get through, but you can always send us an email mailbag at orangelaungerated.com
11126460	11131100	or you might be able to get a last minute tweet in real quick. Look at it. The suggested retail
11131100	11138140	of action 52, $200, but it really was, I guess like 52 different like games that were in it.
11138140	11143100	Like they actually have, they were all different games. I'm sure they were all shitty. In fact,
11143100	11149500	one of them, I guess, crashes right when you started up. Awesome. All right. Uh, let's see,
11149500	11154540	going on to more tweets here at twitter.com slash O L R M and Ziba tweets us about, you know,
11154540	11159660	we were talking earlier in the show about WTF battleship. She tweeted us the monopoly
11159660	11163260	parody movie trailer. I don't know if I want to play this whole thing. We can start in the
11163260	11169900	beginning here. Let's see. Richie Benjamin never followed in his father's footsteps
11172300	11176940	until one day when all that changed, this is where your father left you
11176940	11181420	a board game.
11189180	11190140	Thanks a lot, dad.
11198140	11201660	He threw all the, he threw all the houses on the ground and then of course the house shook
11201660	11206140	go in a world where money matters.
11210460	11212460	You lost kid. Who are you?
11217020	11220380	For the first time in his life, Richie is taking a chance.
11222780	11225340	I want to teach you all about the game.
11225340	11235180	Rolling the dice. Yeah, it's got strippers. This is already better than the battleship trailer.
11235980	11243980	Never fall in love. Unless it's with money. The community chest.
11243980	11254620	Oh, this is great. Love her more than money. I don't care what you think because now I have
11254620	11264380	the monopoly. Oh son, don't you know only I can win this game this summer. Do not pass go.
11264380	11274380	You didn't pay the luxury tax. Go to jail. Do not collect $200.
11286780	11288700	That was great. I would see that.
11288700	11294780	They should screen that at midnight at the shadiest looking theater in town.
11296780	11299900	After Rocky Horror, of course. Of course.
11302060	11305820	Act Def tweets is something that somehow we missed in our news feed tonight. Dragon Age
11305820	11310700	got removed from Steam because of DLC issues. Basically EA has a lot of sand in their vagina
11310700	11314860	and it basically has to do with origin. But I guess what they're saying is it has to do with
11314860	11319740	the whole, you know, it's that whole thing where Steam wants to control the download stuff but EA
11319740	11325420	really wants that in their own house and herpa derp. EA says at EA we offer our games and content
11325420	11331180	to all major download services. Unfortunately Steam has adopted a set of restricted terms
11331180	11335820	of service which limit how developers interact with customers to sell downloadable content.
11335820	11340620	No other download services adopted this practice. Consequently some of our games have been removed
11340620	11349420	by Steam. Whatever. That's a bummer. Dragon Age is a pretty cool game. Uh, apparently,
11349420	11355820	uh, Darth Tetsuya is tweeting and saying WonderCon 2012 moved from San Francisco to Anaheim
11356460	11364380	just for the next year. That's kind of a big deal. Like, that's far. That's a six hour drive between
11364380	11370060	the two if not more. WonderCon, which is probably the second or third largest comic convention next
11370060	11378060	to actual Comic-Con and maybe what, New York Comic-Con, uh, is moving. But I guess it's just
11378060	11385980	this year. Yeah. Interesting. Oh, but they're saying now there are some updates saying nothing
11385980	11391900	has actually been confirmed about this. I guess Anaheim is in discussion right now.
11392620	11395420	So it's don't freak out yet. Yeah, maybe it's don't freak out yet.
11395420	11399900	Uh, let's see. Uh, Darth Tetsuya is saying Wonder what the holdup was for the worldwide release of
11399900	11407420	La Mulana. It's Germany! I guess La Mulana has been held up for release in Germany. What is it?
11407420	11414300	Uh, I'm trying to read here. The ratings board of Germany, excuse me, the USK,
11416300	11421100	uh, Nigoro, who developed the game, submitted the game for review to the ESRB, the OFLC,
11421100	11426140	and the USK two months ago. Uh, those, the other two boards have the game ready to go,
11426140	11432060	but the USK has not finished yet. Interesting. I guess they can't release it until it gets reviewed.
11432860	11438860	Sorry, Joe. I know you're a big fan of La Mulana. Maybe soon. Spazinator giving us an update on the
11438860	11445100	PS3 saga. I sent my PS3 in for repairs this past Friday. I figure that I'm likely to get it back
11445100	11451820	early next week. We will see. SSJ100Matt tweets us saying the only way to defeat China is to attack
11451820	11459740	their productivity. Coming soon to China. Angry Birds. That's right. Angry Birds is coming to
11459740	11465180	China. Uh, I guess, uh, in order to prevent knockoffs and so forth. I don't know. It was
11465180	11469740	officially launched in May through a partnership with Chinese mobile games network Downjoy.
11469740	11475340	Uh, but so far, there's been all these knockoffs and pirated versions on jailbroken iPhones,
11475340	11481580	but now Rovio has teamed up with the ad network Madhouse to try and expand the game's presence.
11482940	11487820	I still say, uh, Angry Birds isn't really all that, and I don't understand why so many people
11487820	11496540	are so like losing their shit over it. Amen. All right. Uh, Tigerclaw sends us a tweet here.
11496540	11501740	Samsung is going to be manufacturing the PlayStation Vita CPU. Uh, the core processing
11501740	11506780	unit or central processing unit of Samsung's upcoming portable will be, excuse me, by Sony's
11506780	11512140	upcoming portable will be done by Samsung. These are from Samsung. These are from online reports
11512140	11518060	out of Japan. Uh, this was on the website of Japanese industry paper, the semiconductor
11518060	11524220	industry news. Not a lot of further con, uh, text besides just that, but there you go.
11524220	11532300	Samsung will play a role in the actual development of the Vita. There it is. Your Twitter topics,
11532300	11537420	twitter.com slash O L R. If you want to get in your tweets in the future. By the way,
11537420	11544620	huh? Did you hear about the, um, last sales reports on, um, smartphones? Motor roll is dipped
11544620	11550460	way down. Well, yeah, cause libraries going out, it's all Androids and, uh, iPhones. Now
11550460	11555500	the top three is Apple, Samsung and Nokia. Interesting. I would think blackberries are
11555500	11559900	still big in the corporate world. They're interesting. They've gone way down. They're
11559900	11566060	not, they're not in the top three. So interesting. All right. Well, uh, before we close out the
11566060	11569020	show tonight, I got to go to Loki and ask if there's any last minute stories he wants
11569020	11577100	to tear through. Um, no. Wow. We, we covered quite a bit of everything. So there you go.
11577100	11584700	All right. Well, uh, we'll work on more last minute stories for next week, but I guess
11584700	11588220	we've covered everything so far tonight. If you think we missed a topic, you can always
11588220	11592300	email us mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and we'll bring it up on next week's show.
11592300	11595820	Um, thank you guys of course, as always for downloading our show and supporting orange
11595820	11600700	lounge radio. We really appreciate it. Remember we do the show for free. We don't play commercials.
11600700	11604380	All we really ask help spread the word about orange launch radio. Get more butts in our
11604380	11608860	chat room on Sunday night. Tell a friend about the show. Even if you're like, I don't really
11608860	11612620	know who I could tell about orange on video, help spread the word on websites. Uh, there's
11612620	11617260	people that put signatures on forums, uh, or just as simple as leaving a five star review
11617260	11621500	in iTunes really goes a long way because that drives the popularity rankings and helps us
11621500	11625820	get exposure to more people. Uh, there's been some reports on the internet this week that
11625820	11630540	I've seen come up on Google plus and all that, uh, people linking stories saying podcasting
11630540	11637580	is dying. Well to that I say because maybe corporate podcasting is dying, but people
11637580	11640940	like us were never really in it for the money anyways. And we were doing this since before
11640940	11646620	podcasting. We're not going away anytime soon. We're awesome sauce, but we can still use
11646620	11651100	every piece of word of mouth we can get and we'll continue to provide this show for your work day
11651100	11657580	and whatever else. So there you go, but we can't have call it a show until we get around
11657580	11662060	and get everybody's final thoughts. So dark soccer, what's your final thought tonight?
11662060	11667340	Um, I think we're going to miss pinkberry. Yes, this makes me sad, but, uh, we'll, we'll do it
11667340	11673260	another time. Maybe on Tuesday. I would like to do a tiny little plug. Look on geek life tomorrow,
11673260	11680300	geek-life.com for a special geeks in history that has to do with Nintendo. All right. A Nintendo
11680300	11685740	geek in history. Yes. Very cool. Uh, Loki, your last minute story tonight. Oh, I don't have any
11685740	11691500	last minute stories, but excuse me, your final thought tonight. Uh, fortunately today is both,
11691500	11699500	uh, very sad and, uh, but kind of happy tomorrow though. Sad because it is the two year anniversary
11699500	11707180	of the twins death. Unfortunately, uh, we lost two babies two years ago. Um, however happy news,
11707180	11711900	though. Josh's first birthday is tomorrow. So, uh, happy birthday to Josh. I never realized it
11711900	11716380	was in such class, close proximity to each other. Everything is on the 31st of the first.
11717180	11723340	Interesting. Well, you know, um, looking forward, uh, I look forward to Josh's first birthday. I'm
11723340	11727500	sure it'll be looking forward to seeing pictures of the mess he's going to make. Oh, we've already
11727500	11733180	fed him, um, that kind of stuff. Like extra for his nephew and that party we actually had,
11733180	11739260	we had a professional, uh, pictures taken of him and he's eating a cupcake and that was funny.
11739260	11745020	Oh, that's cute. We had a picture of my brother Matthew when he was one sitting in his high chair
11745020	11750540	with a cake in front of him and half the cake demolished by smash, smash, smash. I think
11750540	11754300	there's a picture like that of me out there somewhere too. You'll never see it. He's having
11754300	11762140	his, uh, birthday party next Saturday. It is a pork theme party. Um, awesome. And, uh, so we
11762140	11767260	all have a little piggy cake then, but no tomorrow we want the leftovers. Uh, tomorrow we're taking
11767260	11772540	him to, uh, at least I do. Maybe not dark, sorry. We're taking him to, um, the gallery to go on the
11772540	11778540	merry-go-round. Oh, fun. Good time. And maybe have some ice cream. Uh, my final thought tonight is
11778540	11785260	there may not be time for pink berry, but there's always time for tacos. Yes. That's going to do it
11785260	11788700	for another episode of orange launch radio. Thanks again for tuning in and spending your day with us
11788700	11792300	your past three hours or what have you. Uh, we really appreciate it. And guess what? We're gonna
