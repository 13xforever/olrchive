10273	12476	Sky, and Loki.
14039	18745	Tonight, July 31st, 2011, Nintendo slashes the price of the 3DS.
19186	22250	The average price of an Xbox Live Arcade title is going up.
22591	25135	And could the PlayStation 3 soon feature a doll?
31957	32277	PinkBerry
61431	62732	Actually, it's been about a week and a half.
62752	64393	That's why you feel disconnected.
65493	67995	Well, then maybe we should end the show early and go get Pinkberry.
68235	69196	I'm down with that.
69316	70336	Last week's show was a marathon.
70376	71257	And that's the show.
71337	71717	There you go.
71737	72397	Good night, everybody.
73338	74519	Blah, blah, blah, Nintendo.
74539	75599	Blah, blah, blah, Ubisoft.
75619	75959	Good night.
76580	77080	No, just kidding.
77380	79441	All right, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.
80262	80542	Hello.
81182	81923	How are you doing, Loki?
82703	83304	I'm doing great.
83324	84384	Are you feeling connected?
84684	85705	Are you on the grid this week?
86520	88342	Yeah, I'm on the grid.
102799	105662	If you've never joined us for a live show, it's a totally different experience.
105702	106603	I really encourage you to.
107144	114551	Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, here at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
114972	118535	And we do have some folks in our chat room already starting there.
118755	120057	And let's see where we got here.
120217	124081	SSJ100Matt says, this episode of OLR is brought to you by a higher debt ceiling.
124992	138024	I hope they got all that crap fixed but I hear it's still stalemate but I don't want to get too political because I'll just get angry because that stuff kind of has a direct impact on my life if that starts affecting the unemployment and all that like they're saying is going to happen.
138485	144590	So let's try to move on to happier topics like games that keep us entertained when these things go wrong in our country.
144990	148614	So DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with how is your gaming week?
149890	150230	It was.
150470	152953	I played WoW all up until the show.
154234	158178	I was trying to get that achievement, the classic dungeon master, whatever.
158678	160981	You know, achievements weren't around when you first started playing WoW.
161001	167087	Do you think achievements have kind of, clearly they were just ripped right off Xbox Live, but do you think they've really added something to the WoW experience?
167924	168885	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
182904	185044	Yeah, but I mean, it's kind of fun.
185125	188085	You know, I'll get like a wild hair and say, okay, I'm going to finish this.
189045	190306	And then it'll give me an excuse.
190326	194327	Because honestly, my favorite character to play is my 85 mage.
194947	195807	I love my mage.
196647	198768	And so it just gives me an excuse to keep playing her.
199708	202648	Instead of, oh, I can't really do anything right now.
203329	209170	So I'll just, I guess, work on this other one instead of making another mage and leveling another mage.
210230	213192	I don't know somebody, though, who has eight level 85 druids.
215614	218036	Well, anything in the non-MMO universe that you've been up to?
218456	219156	Groove Coaster.
220177	221258	That game is fun.
221658	222439	And I blame Shane.
223079	223620	It's his fault.
224200	226281	And Groove Coaster, of course, on the iOS, right?
226341	228343	It's iPad and iPhone, right?
228403	229464	Yes, 3GS and Apple.
229584	232646	I'm assuming it'll work on the iPod, unlike Google+, apparently.
232946	235668	Does not work on anything with the iPhone, which is a little silly, but...
235988	254742	and the app really is not that great it's more stable than Facebook's app at this point you know I haven't updated Facebook app since they changed the photos oh really so I didn't update to that one because someone warned me so I haven't updated my Facebook app in like months nice
255290	255891	and I'm not going to
271152	296819	Maybe tomorrow, on a Monday, maybe it got pushed back, who knows It's going to be very interesting when the games roll out Because it's going to make the two go head-to-head even more But right now, I think it's still too early to tell But I think a little valid competition And yeah, clearly everybody wants a piece of the social networking space But, you know, Facebook, or I should say Google Plus Has really succeeded at biting at Facebook's kneecaps In places where MySpace...
297819	301701	Orkut, Buzz, even, you know, and other social networks have failed to do so.
301901	304622	Just wait until Myspace rolls out their even better game service.
305062	306042	They're coming back, baby.
307043	307903	Well, you never know.
307963	308683	You never know.
309144	315346	I mean, as things change ownership and things change hands and so forth, you never know.
315406	317947	Don't ever count out somebody who's been gone for a while.
317967	319428	I mean, look at Origin, right?
320628	324992	Origin was an EA brand that kind of disappeared, unfortunately, because they used to make a lot of great games back in the day.
325393	326734	And then the brand faded.
326794	328215	Now it's back as a store.
328575	329737	That could be interesting.
330357	331758	Could MySpace come back as a store?
331878	332259	Probably not.
332939	337303	Anyhow, I just want to say the competition, I think, is a little bit healthy for Facebook.
337343	341107	Well, you know, they do say that festering piles of crap work as fertilizer.
341127	341987	Yeah.
342808	343509	Oendan, Elite Beat Agents
363727	391352	but the lines keep moving and they'll sneak up on you and like the track will curve and that has a very vib ribbon type of vibe to it it really just made me think of playing vib ribbon except you know you're just pushing little you know you're tapping along and sometimes it's easy to figure out what the rhythm is but sometimes it's really freaking difficult I'm still kind of getting used to it but it's got the first Arkanoid song which was boop boop you know that was pretty fun and I actually got a little motion sick off of it
391872	392273	Wow.
392413	393474	So I don't know that I'd be able to do it.
393494	397840	Well, it is very light, seizure-y, you know, fast motions.
398701	400804	It's on the parts where it starts spiraling downwards.
401384	402946	Then that's where I get a little motion sick.
404048	404769	It's very interesting.
404809	407913	I've been playing a lot of Groove Coaster this week, too, because obviously, you know, I love music games.
407933	408533	It's a dollar.
408774	409274	No secret.
409294	409675	Yeah, it's...
410015	410615	It's still a buck.
430427	430647	Nice.
431048	435412	So, definitely, if you're a music game fan at all, you definitely want to check out Space Invaders.
436834	439316	Well, you can check out Space Invaders, too, but a groove coaster is only a buck.
439716	444661	And what I love so much about this game, it's the perfect phone game, in my opinion.
444721	447004	It's everything you want out of a phone game.
447144	451688	Except, you cannot sneak into the bathroom at work and play it unless you have your headphones.
452529	453389	Well, yes, there is that.
453470	454250	I suppose there's that.
454530	459192	But the thing about Groove Coaster is that you can play it in short little minute and a half, three minute boosts.
459793	461354	It's very pretty to watch.
461734	468737	So it's that kind of like audio stimulation, visual stimulation, little diversion for just a few minutes.
468877	471179	Or you could sit there and play every song and be diverted for an hour.
471199	471879	But no trans vibrator mode.
472299	473380	No, no trans vibrator mode.
473640	480284	But I think in some ways it's like just, it was designed very well with the phone audience in mind.
480404	481605	And I think that's what's great about it.
481785	490310	Because half of playing it is kind of just those visuals of going around the spirals and ooh, ah, I'm in a trance for three minutes and wasting my time.
490330	496934	But coaster is a very good word because it really is like this massive galactic roller coaster.
496974	498575	And it even shows you the track when you're done.
499395	500436	So I think that's kind of cool.
501737	502839	See the path you've been on
514645	515706	Yeah.
516026	517348	I really had a good time with it.
517848	522313	Like I said, I've gotten up to the first Arkanoid song, which is like, what, the second stage?
523334	525616	Or second set of stages or something?
525736	526977	Yeah.
527598	532843	And there's different, you know, I guess musicians that have worked on the tracks for the game, so it's pretty cool.
533704	534004	And then...
535766	535967	Workin' it.
547891	550032	Actually, yeah, I'm doing cross-training now.
550252	552534	Now, at some point, I'm going to have to loan you one of my Kinect games.
552574	553374	You guys have Kinect?
553774	556596	Yes, I have a Kinect I haven't opened because I haven't had anything I want to play.
556816	559278	Well, you'll have to try one of these fitness games that I was trying out.
559318	561759	You might be into it if you're all about fitness and stuff.
561779	562940	I really want to try the UFC game.
563980	564400	Oh, yeah.
564420	564881	UFC trainer.
564901	566081	I've heard interesting things about that.
566842	568603	I don't know if I want to train to be an ultimate fighter.
569363	570164	I'll just train to be it.
570204	570804	Although, I don't know.
571665	573946	Sometimes in these arguments, I've got to take Jamie out.
574440	575941	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
601538	616489	And then we had our company game summit thing So some of the publishers brought out things for me to try Oh yeah, you got a little slice of E3 at your door this week, didn't ya?
616809	619671	Very small slice of E3 Alright, well what'd you check out?
619811	623794	Okay, so I played the newest build of K'nex Star Wars
625195	627017	And there's a couple things about it.
627357	635125	One, they said that apparently they took development staff off of Dance Central 2 to finish polishing up Connect Star Wars.
635606	637468	But Harmonix makes Dance Central.
637868	639049	Yeah, but it's still Microsoft.
639810	641991	Oh, Microsoft doesn't own Harmonix.
643152	644853	But they still have staff working on that.
645213	645733	Okay.
646494	652036	I'm a little... That seems a little... Well, it's just... Or is it one of those disingenuous things where we move some of the marketing staff?
652357	652877	No, no, no.
652897	653937	It has nothing to do with the game.
653957	654538	It's development staff.
654658	657659	It's the same thing as... It's LucasArts making the game.
657799	658740	Yes, I understand that.
658900	659300	Yeah, okay.
659440	661021	Okay, that's what the rep told me.
661201	662122	All right, fair enough.
662182	663162	Just repeating what I heard.
663342	664523	A little strange, but all right.
664963	666264	Especially... Different coasts, too.
666324	668185	LucasArts is over in the Bay Area, right?
668245	668465	And then...
669166	676137	I don't know where their video game development house is I'm assuming it's North Bay like the rest of LucasArts but then of course Harmonix is out in Boston
678975	680737	I'm saying I don't know, okay?
680837	681798	Alright, fair enough.
683059	687222	I'd assume it's more than just maybe one development house working on it.
687763	690885	Okay, so, played a bit of Kinect Star Wars.
690905	696130	They had, of course, at Comic-Con, the new build had pod racing in it.
696590	701254	And also they had the regular little demo thing that you go through.
703776	720695	Uh, yeah, you know, it's alright, I guess, but once again, it's just kind of, you can tell how well it's gonna be just by looking at it in the videos and stuff, and it, right, for me, it plays okay, but...
722423	723144	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
744426	750109	You can knock it off either side, but they wanted you to knock it off the left side because it's a lot easier to do it.
750489	756711	So I ended up not knowing that, obviously, so I moved it to the right, trying to get it to fall off the edge of the thing.
757392	762334	So I got it to the point where it's literally sitting on the edge, teetering, not quite moving off the edge.
762614	766095	And I'm at the point where I'm, why do I have to knock it off the edge?
766195	769737	There's clearly like 20 feet of space next to it that I could run by.
771720	780002	Since I'm a Jedi, I think I can be able to manage to fit my ego through that 20-foot patch of space there to get where I need to go.
780322	785963	Or, I don't know, maybe because since my character can force jump anyways, I could have just hopped over the goddamn thing instead of knocking off the edge.
786403	789143	But no, the game wants you to knock it over the edge before you can move on.
789223	791264	So I'm sitting there, like, pushing at it.
791344	793704	Like, tap, tap, tap, come on, get off the damn edge.
793984	796405	Finally got the tip over, and then I moved on.
796585	796885	But, um...
798274	798814	POD Racing POD Racing
816761	817382	Parties and drunken nights
845302	849064	It's not like... I mean, it's kind of on rails, sort of.
849345	853667	I mean, you can dash towards things and you can dodge stuff.
853767	856149	But, you know, all the gestures are very basic.
856269	857830	And, you know, it's still very early.
857870	861832	I mean, the game right now, it's probably not even in beta.
861912	865174	And it's, you know, July and the game's coming out in November.
865334	868757	So, there's still plenty of time, you know, to polish it up.
868817	869997	And it's playable.
870218	871058	It's not terrible.
871298	871698	I mean, it...
872819	874200	It's just not something I would buy.
874620	875840	But it's alright.
876060	881582	It's just something that if someone likes The Force Unleashed or something like that, they're not probably going to get a lot out of this.
881922	883123	Let's say Josh was 11.
884163	885284	Would you want to buy it then?
885704	888045	He'd probably dig it.
888085	889825	That's where I'm thinking this is going to.
890766	894807	This is very much for the same audience that kind of supported The Connect to begin with.
894847	896008	It wasn't really the hardcore.
896048	896748	It was more of the...
897620	898341	LightSaber on!
916303	918364	Maybe you still could say lightsaber on.
918484	919204	Yeah, I wouldn't.
919304	920685	Okay, that would be terrible.
921785	923486	So, it was okay.
923786	925607	Pod racing, though, I was slamming the walls.
925667	926167	But you know what?
926267	929748	I blame that probably a little bit on myself because I didn't know how to control a damn thing.
930349	940493	Because, you know, I went through the tutorial for the single-player regular game portion, but the rep just put me straight into the game for the pod racing, and so...
942295	944077	I guess there's dual throttles on that thing.
944157	946359	So I was just like, full speed all the time.
947380	949343	Maybe that's not the greatest thing.
951205	955510	But the game itself, the pod racing, it's very much like the movie.
956151	956731	It's kind of cool.
956892	960676	So if they get the controls correct, it might not be that bad.
961604	964425	Do they have Greg Proops doing the announcing during the Star Wars sequence?
964465	970147	Because I'll tell you, a shout out to one of my other favorite podcasts, Smartest Man in the World with Greg Proops.
970407	972748	He was in Star Wars Episode I narrating the pod races.
972808	973949	He was one of the two heads on the dude.
973969	974629	I think he is.
974969	975469	Is he really?
976190	977130	It's the same voices.
977430	977810	Awesome.
978231	978451	Yes.
979051	981492	So, yeah, that'll be cool.
982732	983393	So it was all right.
983593	989295	And then the other game I saw was Skylanders, which is the new Spyro game.
990055	996321	And, you know, I was just sitting there with the two Activision reps and one of them I mentioned, I'm like, you know, it's like $70.
997622	999985	I mean, really, you think people are going to buy this, you know.
1001548	1031217	and they think that it's going to sell well I mean it's kind of neat I guess for kids because you can just pop this little toy on there and you know away you go and you can play as that character and they're going to have I guess 30 characters that you can play in the game but the thing is that kind of sucks you need certain characters to go access certain parts of the game like you know if you want to go underwater you can't use a fire monster you have to use something else so they kind of want you to buy the toys which are fucking expensive they're like 8 bucks each
1031537	1035501	and you know eight bucks for an action figure that's not so bad you know G.I.
1035521	1051676	Joe's I used to buy those and that makes sense but these are like they're figurines they don't move they don't articulate at all they're just on you know not it's just mainly for the game it's like physical download content is basically what this is um
1052817	1053918	So it's an experiment.
1054038	1054859	I guess you'll be right.
1054899	1063287	But if you're a fan of Spyro and you really want to play a Spyro game, I would check this out as a demo or something first.
1063367	1068331	I was going to say, I will admit, I kind of got sick of Spyro.
1068451	1070313	Spyro just kind of got oversaturated.
1070353	1075518	But I haven't played a Spyro game in so long that I think back to the original one on PlayStation 1 very fondly.
1075538	1076458	This is not like that.
1076899	1076999	Oh.
1077099	1084521	I mean, it's like that in the world sense, but it's not... Spyro looks fucking angry in it.
1085181	1086581	Spyro got more hardcore.
1086721	1088501	He's like, what the fuck did you do to my games?
1088541	1090162	I'm so fucking pissed!
1090882	1092942	He just has this angry look on his face.
1093022	1094823	They made him emo-ragey.
1094903	1096123	They're targeting a new audience.
1096143	1097803	They're targeting angry people with money.
1099024	1100024	It was alright.
1101444	1103965	I didn't get to play Just Dance 3 because...
1105310	1109192	Oh, I bet you're just torn up about that one.
1109212	1110593	Hey, Just Dance 2 was pretty fun.
1110853	1111313	I played it.
1113935	1116516	Is Just Dance 3 on all the consoles now, or is that just Wii?
1116816	1125821	She was going to bring it on the Wii, bring a Wii dev kit because she had that, but unfortunately they had issues with syncing controllers or something.
1126121	1127323	Ninja Gaiden 3 Ninja Gaiden 3
1143741	1144482	Really violent.
1145824	1146244	Of course.
1146484	1154814	Because every time you slash through somebody and you cut people in half and stuff, it goes in really close.
1155154	1159479	Basically, they were saying that the theme this year was that they wanted to...
1162108	1181598	I just convey the feeling of slicing somebody in half is what they're trying to go for alright I'm bringing up a YouTube here so I can try and see some of this here I'm just randomly finding a YouTube channel hoping there's no narration in the background here I don't want to hear this dude narrating let's see if we can find something else a little more
1185134	1187475	I really don't want to hear Adam Sessler narrating over this stuff
1209776	1234483	and of course theirs is timing out well this segment's going nowhere live radio boys and girls I'll just have to take Loki's word for it it's a pretty awesome game granted though that the difficulty was ramped way down because it is a demo and they don't want everybody to fail on it but there is going to be like I guess some sort of casual gaming mode or like an easy mode or something you can play so but you know just really over the top fun game though alright was that it?
1236243	1239004	yeah oh did Ninja Gaiden 3 make you want to go back and play the other ones?
1240748	1241069	Uh, no.
1241329	1246016	Because Ninja Gaiden's not really a game I would think that I need to play the other ones, you know?
1246296	1251223	Like, if you were to play Ninja Gaiden 3... Yeah, but if you like 3, you might as well go back and see what you missed in 1 and 2.
1251464	1252746	I mean, 1's, well...
1253755	1281547	obviously there's obviously there's the old old old what there's the Atari arcade game and then there were the Nintendo NES games by Tecmo and now you know you had this new trilogy that started I believe on Xbox was because Ninja Gaiden was a huge exclusive for the original Xbox you know then what Ninja Gaiden 2 was on I think 360 in that yeah well and they also have the PS3 once the Sigma series right right so you can always check that out
1281943	1296434	Yeah, I mean... It's not really something I necessarily need to do, but... Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Doing Laundryman in our chatroom says, Chopping people in half?
1296634	1298435	Loki finally gets to live one of his dreams.
1298556	1308463	Oh, speaking... Not really the chopping people in half thing, but I did remember there was a few other things that I didn't get to play, but stuff I learned, which is kind of cool.
1308603	1308843	Okay.
1309464	1309584	Um...
1311164	1312106	Saints Row the Third.
1312166	1316956	I got a little peek at, because, you know, I fucking love Saints Row.
1316976	1319360	I know, you're just eating that stuff up with a spoon.
1319401	1320663	You are so excited.
1320723	1321926	You're going to be there at midnight.
1324408	1326489	No, a couple things about Saints Row the Third.
1326769	1332671	One, I was looking at their, they had their kind of lineup of their advertising campaign.
1332831	1335052	So everything they're doing up from now to launch.
1335672	1342255	And one of the things that's later on, not announced yet, is a new mode that they're going to have.
1342815	1346856	Like, you know, all the other games have their kind of horde mode and stuff like that.
1347036	1349897	Well, they're going to have horde mode, as in whores.
1350177	1350258	Yeah.
1352218	1362425	And basically when you turn on horde mode, random prostitutes will attack you on the streets.
1364066	1364946	It's awesome.
1365026	1366207	I'm just like, yes!
1366988	1368148	This game is amazing.
1369069	1370330	What game do I want to play today?
1370490	1372431	I know, I want to get attacked by prostitutes.
1372491	1374172	Just armies of prostitutes.
1375053	1376274	Are they yelling things at you?
1376334	1376794	You know, like...
1378923	1380905	I don't know, but it's going to be awesome.
1380945	1382487	So that's something they're going to be talking about.
1382707	1391556	They're going to have some sort of invite-only demo thing that my THQ rep says that they're going to try because I'm such a huge fan.
1391577	1392758	They're going to try to get me into it.
1393038	1394339	Oh God, if that would happen.
1395501	1396502	I don't know what I would do.
1396562	1400846	It almost sounds like you took that rep in the back alley and did what you had to do to get a sneak peek.
1403217	1407142	I'm probably the biggest Spyro fan here and I'm glad the game is like the original.
1407162	1408623	I thought the Legend series brought it down.
1421581	1427944	And let's see, Spazinator in our chatroom says, Agreed, I was just playing Ninja Gaiden 2 the other day.
1428004	1430025	The camera needs improvement, to put it mildly.
1430805	1431605	So, there you go.
1432046	1437348	And Actdeft is hearing you talking about Saints Row the 3rd saying, Best game ever, period.
1437408	1438628	Hold on guys, the game's not out yet.
1438908	1443490	What you don't want to do, do not hype the game beyond your expectations because you'll only set yourself up for disappointment.
1443850	1446491	So, I'm just going to tell you guys now, Saints Row sucks.
1446932	1447892	It fucking blows.
1448292	1449733	That way, if it's good, you'll be...
1450553	1463845	Sonic Generations sounds like it's going to have a lot of fan service in it including I guess there's different things that you unlock by beating certain challenges in each level including some of the original games.
1463865	1466708	You can unlock Sonic 1 in there and some other stuff.
1467148	1467688	Interesting.
1467948	1468388	Yeah.
1468408	1468668	Okay.
1469609	1471229	So let's see, Sonic 1.
1471329	1475811	How many times has that game been whored out in the past few years?
1475851	1478812	Let's see, we had the Sonic Mega Genesis collection.
1479132	1482012	You could pay 400 Microsoft points and get it that way.
1482653	1485153	And now it's going to be an unlockable in another game.
1485433	1489995	And that's not counting when we saw it probably back on the GameCube and every other collection known to man.
1490475	1493896	I mean, how many times are you going to pimp out Sonic?
1493956	1495097	Dead Rising 2, The Way We Meant To Do It
1517955	1520517	I love some of the random comments our chatters make sometimes.
1520978	1531387	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom says, I think in the Bizarro world, Bizarro Loki likes playing sports games, MMOs, enjoys eating steamed broccoli, and looking at tasteful porn.
1533569	1535610	I enjoyed MMOs and tasteful porn.
1538193	1539294	But fuck steamed broccoli.
1539714	1540815	Yeah, fuck steamed broccoli.
1540855	1541776	That's disgusting.
1542170	1544632	All right, moving on, My Gaming Week.
1544992	1546433	Not a whole lot of new stuff.
1546473	1549434	Again, I've kind of been focusing on many of the games I already have.
1549955	1552296	I've been playing those, including, of course, WoW.
1552576	1553977	Been revisiting some old stuff.
1554017	1561221	I was randomly playing some Super Street Fighter IV this week, as well as Wipeout HD, which I finally looked at the Fury expansion, what, like two years later?
1561782	1562682	You know, well, since...
1563903	1566764	In my household, there's two of us and we share a PlayStation 3.
1567484	1570625	So I got two of the games and the Salacious Pop got two other games.
1570665	1572725	So he got the Wipeout with Fury in it.
1573145	1573806	So that.
1574106	1577867	And I played the Bomberman game because it's free on PlayStation Plus right now.
1578007	1582428	And since I didn't cash in the PlayStation Plus until right at the end, I'm still on it.
1582908	1584988	So Bomberman's free right now.
1585048	1586369	And I played that and it's...
1587429	1593131	Bomberman was great in 95, and now it's something that's better left in my memory.
1593191	1594992	I forgot I signed up for PlayStation Plus.
1595692	1596653	There's some free games.
1596933	1597733	I didn't miss anything.
1597753	1601335	Go get some trophies or something.
1601375	1603396	Free until the 3rd or whenever it wears out, I know.
1604976	1622883	you can check that out also as far as other games I've been playing that are a little bit newer I talked about Bastion last week I said I'd only played the demo I did end up upgrading to the full version and I'm glad I did I'm still enjoying Bastion some things that didn't show up in the demo there's another weapon that I really like like a sword weapon that you can throw
1623323	1623844	Thanks for watching!
1639685	1640245	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1664093	1665234	I also checked out From Dust.
1666236	1667056	This is just a demo.
1667237	1669319	So again, these are impressions based on a demo.
1669960	1675446	I had heard it was like the old games Populous, which I loved that game back in the day.
1675526	1677808	So I was all about ready to try this.
1677908	1680751	And I checked out the demo and it's very...
1683654	1687075	The way it's presented, the presentation of the game is great.
1687236	1690097	I mean, everything is very gorgeous.
1690537	1692678	Everything is well done in the way it's put together.
1692738	1694859	It felt like a disc-based game, honestly.
1694919	1699762	I'm really surprised they packed all this into an arcade release, although I think it was like a gig download.
1699822	1705445	So, I mean, and some 360 games are like several hundred megs, so this is almost as big as a disc game.
1706259	1717488	I will say where I got frustrated though is that I honestly found the demo, I couldn't really get past one of the stages in the demo and I found it really frustrating because the way I was laying down the sand or something was just not right.
1717588	1724114	I mean maybe I just need to approach it again with a clear head but it was one of those points of early frustration where I'm like well shit if I can't beat the demo then...
1724614	1749918	I ain't wasting my money on the full game but I liked where it was going so I can't really say it reflects on the game negatively I think it's just one of those try this for yourself because it's something you have to experience but it's not really for everybody so that's the beautiful thing about arcade there's demos of every game so if you like those types of games like Populous I'm trying to think what else maybe Lemmings-esque
1750478	1752019	I kind of reminded of that a little bit.
1752739	1753779	You might enjoy this game.
1754059	1756240	So check that out.
1756640	1758441	That's really otherwise about it.
1759461	1761942	I want to get my classic game on next weekend.
1762082	1769085	I was talking to SalaciousPop about wanting to hook up the Dreamcast to play the NES emulator to go play some old games.
1769125	1770645	So I might do some of that this weekend.
1770665	1772706	I forgot a game I played this week.
1773046	1774367	Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.
1774527	1775127	Oh my gosh.
1775683	1776143	Wow.
1777184	1777964	Old school.
1778004	1779305	Where the hell did that come from?
1779365	1780285	Wasn't that on Sega CD?
1780365	1782366	I think there was a version on Sega CD.
1782386	1784307	I think there was a version on Genesis, though.
1784387	1786208	I played it on my arcade cabinet.
1788469	1788849	It was fun.
1789389	1789689	I don't know.
1789829	1796032	I just wanted to play a beat-em-up game that wasn't Ninja Turtles or something I'd played before.
1796192	1797593	So, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs it was.
1798213	1802835	And there's a character in there that looks just like Blanka, except he has a tail and weird eyes.
1804375	1804875	By the way, Rob.
1805096	1805256	What?
1806116	1807097	Didn't we give you an S?
1808017	1808257	You did.
1808898	1809118	Okay.
1809338	1810499	But I don't have a lot of carts.
1810999	1811479	I have some.
1811660	1814341	I can, I was going to say, I'd be more than happy to do some games.
1814541	1815222	We'll see, we'll see.
1815582	1817723	So that you can have the excitement of blowing into the cartridges.
1817743	1818284	I know, right?
1818304	1819765	And then into the machine and then swapping them.
1820305	1822206	Go to our chat room at chat.org.
1822226	1823107	Some comments from our chat.
1823327	1828210	BlackWolf, the man before us Sunday nights at all games, is in chat saying, Sky, take out the narrator.
1828310	1829711	Is Bastion still worth it?
1830325	1840531	Yes, but keep in mind, you know, every gamer's a little different, and I really like these isometric, platformy type of games.
1840731	1850977	You know, some of my favorite games going back to the NES and Super NES era are Solstice and Equinox and that series, and this game, to me, really kind of harkens back to those games.
1851605	1854906	I don't think it's the sole motivator, but it just makes a good thing better.
1854926	1855506	If that makes sense.
1878534	1881057	If only they had that narrator in Saints Row the Third.
1881478	1886745	And then he decided to stand there and flip off the prostitute.
1888118	1890380	Derek H in the chat says, From Dust is great.
1891340	1893502	I'll admit, I probably didn't give it a fair chance.
1893882	1897504	It was late last night and I just kind of got fed up and I was like, I'm just going to go back to Street Fighter.
1897524	1899126	Fuck this.
1899226	1910193	I'm going to approach it again a little later on because I refuse to believe that I wouldn't really get more out of this game considering I really used to like the SimCity, the Populous, and those types of games back in the day.
1910693	1913975	I keep saying Populous because that's the one I am really reminded of.
1914556	1917438	This really does feel like just an all-new version of that game.
1919619	1920859	All right, moving on.
1921580	1923041	That's pretty much it for our gaming weeks.
1923241	1926822	So let's move on to some housekeeping tonight, of which we don't have a whole lot.
1927703	1930504	We still have every show planned for the month.
1930544	1932245	I don't think we have any shows planned off.
1932545	1936627	There might be one at the end of August, because I'm going to be gone at the end of August, but that's a ways off.
1937048	1942790	You are not going on any trips after all, so we'll be having shows for the foreseeable future, for at least the next four weeks.
1942810	1943711	I will be lonely.
1944905	1945545	Oh, nonsense.
1945666	1947106	That's why you have MMOs.
1947326	1948067	You're never lonely.
1948867	1950248	You will not be forever alone.
1952249	1953609	All right.
1953829	1954229	You know what?
1954289	1959132	If you're feeling forever alone, DarkSakura, you should just hop into our chat room during the week and say, Iken has hug.
1959332	1960772	And there's people in there throughout the week.
1960792	1961653	They'll just say, hugs.
1962433	1962793	There you go.
1963454	1963694	Okay.
1963954	1966255	I challenge you to do that twice this week.
1966715	1967155	Okay.
1967656	1968036	We'll see.
1968696	1995103	Alright Otherwise visit our website www.orangeloungeradio.com Of course you can always visit us on Twitter Twitter.com slash OLR If you have comments on the show as it's going tonight And you're not in the chat You can always send us a tweet And we'll get to some of your tweets later on in the program So twitter.com slash OLR for that Of course we are on Facebook as well Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio We're on Tumblr now I don't think we've been posting a lot there But it's there OrangeLoungeRadio.tumblr.com Right?
1995163	1995604	Is that right?
1996024	1996544	Orange Lounge Radio?
1996564	1997144	Yeah it's there
1997383	1997783	It's new.
1997883	1999324	I don't know all the stuff now.
1999844	2000264	It's new.
2000504	2000904	There you go.
2001845	2003225	Did we finally delete the MySpace?
2003285	2003745	We might have.
2003866	2004566	I think that's gone.
2004606	2007047	Maybe the MySpace is just rotting.
2007067	2010368	It might be just an archive of old, old, old-ass clips from the to-go edition.
2010388	2014049	We may as well just leave it there, like some treasure fossil.
2014089	2014550	There you go.
2014670	2015110	There you go.
2015230	2018511	It'll be like something you discover in From Dusk.
2018531	2020192	It's like doing archaeology in WoW.
2021412	2035017	Anyhow, let's move on to some gaming news and obviously the blogosphere has been blowing up this week with chat on a few topics and I know you're all dying to know what Loki thinks of some of this stuff.
2035197	2037758	I'm dying to know what you guys think of some of this stuff in our chat room.
2038258	2038918	Let's get to it.
2038998	2041939	Loki, will you please do the honors of starting us off with the big news this week?
2042170	2046732	All right, so Nintendo hasn't been doing that great with the 3DS.
2047552	2057935	They cut their profits forecast by 82%, basically dropping their estimated profit from 20 billion yen, or about $257 million, to 110 billion yen, or about 1.41 billion, I guess.
2057955	2058335	Or, I'm sorry...
2070209	2076654	They dropped it down to 20 billion yen from 110 billion yen.
2077014	2078716	Which is quite a drop.
2079436	2095669	And of course, basing it on the fact that they're saying that the stronger than expected yen appreciation and sales performance of the 3DS hardware in sales outlook for the holiday season.
2095689	2095729	Um...
2098011	2108717	So they're going to be dropping the price, of course, of the 3DS on August 12th to $170 from its $250 mark right now.
2109797	2116321	And I guess something similar is going to happen effective August 11th in Japan, dropping the system from 25,000 yen to 15,000 yen.
2121656	2128382	And of course, there's no price yet in Europe, but I'm sure they're going to get some sort of drop.
2129704	2136510	And then, of course, if you're having a little bit of buyer's remorse because you bought a launch system and you're like, what the fuck, you know, $80 now.
2137831	2138451	What am I going to do?
2139132	2141792	Well, Nintendo is actually going to give you some free games.
2142713	2154597	They said basically anybody that signs into Nintendo's eShop before August 12th will be signed up automatically to the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program.
2155397	2182306	and basically you get 10 free NES Virtual Console games on September 1st and I guess it's before the release of the games for everybody else and also some Game Boy Advance games also that's kind of their way of saying hey we're going to have an NES Virtual Console system on the 3DS and also going to offer Game Boy Advance games since this has never been mentioned prior to this um
2183366	2187150	And, you know, in some of the games that they're giving away, I mean, they're not half bad, actually.
2187250	2190213	It's, you know, like The Legend of Zelda, Balloon Fight, Ice Climber.
2190734	2192635	Of course, they're seeing some Game Boy Advance games.
2193076	2200643	Yoshi's Island, Super Mario Advance 3, Mario Kart, Metroid Fusion, WarioWare, Mario vs. Donkey Kong.
2202425	2204527	So, you know, quite a few things.
2205408	2205568	And...
2207623	2211007	Also, I guess... Let's stop there before we get to some of the other stuff.
2211327	2213890	I want to dissect this a little bit because I've got to admit, when did this all come down?
2214071	2216293	It was probably Wednesday or so when this was all announced.
2216874	2224602	And I've got to admit, I was reading the updates through Twitter and so forth and through my Google Reader and I was like...
2225243	2227023	What the hell is going on today?
2227864	2229884	I feel like I've stepped into Bizarro World.
2230004	2231964	What happened at Nintendo?
2232024	2234685	Like, something huge went down there.
2234725	2239286	Because this is just... Does this even feel like the same Nintendo from just a couple months ago?
2239306	2241106	This screams of desperation.
2241586	2249808	I mean, and when I told Salacious Pop about it, and I think he put it best, he said, Wow, Nintendo just totally ate shit.
2251809	2252649	And they really did.
2253149	2253449	Like...
2254833	2265036	What... I mean, clearly the 3DS not performing up to expectations, and there's been a lot of flack on that, but I honestly didn't see this coming.
2265096	2267237	I mean, there's so much about this that's just out of character.
2267817	2270218	A, they didn't announce a price drop today.
2270558	2272899	They announced a price drop a few weeks from now.
2273639	2278481	And that's usually not what you want to do, because that's kind of suicide to your sales right away.
2278541	2281442	But then B, they turn around and announce this program with...
2282762	2284143	20 free games?
2285243	2284143	20?
2286543	2289364	That is not... Nintendo?
2289624	2292325	That is not something I would have ever expected out of Nintendo.
2292405	2296246	But it gives people incentive to buy the system at full price to get the freebies.
2296306	2299206	It does, and I see that perspective of it, but I still don't get it.
2299926	2304408	I still don't get it being Nintendo, because I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2304488	2305988	I would have expected Nintendo to be like,
2306588	2318260	Oh, well, you know, well, we're going to cut the price and, you know, we're going to give you some free Club Nintendo points or we're going to let you have Mario Brothers 2 early or something.
2318680	2321623	I was not expecting 20 games.
2322183	2327328	That is a huge, like, in my opinion, is a huge admission of something on Nintendo.
2327609	2328650	Like, we didn't just fuck up.
2328710	2329611	We fucked up big.
2331023	2332645	That's what's surprising about it to me.
2333325	2339970	To be honest, to be fair, I realize that if I buy something early, like a 3DS, it's very likely to get a price cut in the future.
2340310	2348116	If they had announced a price drop and they said, oh, you only get a Mario game, I would have been like, okay, well, you know, that's the price you pay for getting shit early.
2348556	2352579	Loki imported a 3DS and paid a premium to have it like a couple weeks early.
2352940	2355161	That's just what we do sometimes because we're sick.
2355422	2357063	We want to have the newest gadgets early.
2357543	2358864	I would have been perfectly fine with it.
2359144	2366911	But now to hear there's like 20 free games coming out, now I'm not just like, oh, I'm not unhappy about this price drop.
2366971	2369953	Now I'm like, fuck, I'm really glad I bought one early.
2371435	2374017	I mean, look at the games they're talking about on the Game Boy Advance.
2374497	2379001	Metroid, Yoshi's Island, these are like... Metroid Fusion's fucking awesome.
2379021	2379521	They're not...
2380462	2385485	There might be like half and half, half crap, half triple A titles.
2385525	2386606	I do have a point though to make.
2386906	2387106	What?
2387566	2388967	We're glad that we didn't get one.
2389887	2393830	Because first of all, all of those games that are worth having, I already own.
2394590	2395671	I bought them on my old system.
2397132	2399533	Second, we're not going to spend as much money.
2400322	2404807	Okay, but hold that thought because, Loki, you gotta read this next bit then on this.
2404967	2408090	I know you're dying to give your impressions too, Loki, but I'm gonna make the listeners wait a minute.
2408430	2413435	So, Loki, read this next story because here's where things get real fucking interesting real quick.
2414256	2418040	3DS NES games will also include multiplayer following an update.
2418220	2421944	Yes, you'll be able to play those virtual console games.
2423926	2425127	I guess with other people now.
2425147	2429950	I'm not sure if that's over the internet or if that's just locally, but that's kind of interesting.
2429970	2433172	And here's the list of NES games that they've announced.
2433692	2438875	Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong Jr., Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, and The Legend of Zelda.
2438895	2441837	And then, of course, five other unknown games right now.
2443318	2451603	So, they added multiplayer into Virtual Console, and we don't know yet, but this possibly could be over the internet.
2453175	2455897	They're doing what they should have done with the Wii five years ago?
2456977	2457398	Finally?
2457918	2465262	I mean, that makes these games a lot more... I mean, because let's face it, Nintendo is kind of sucker-punching us a little bit here.
2465302	2472526	If you didn't early adopt the 3DS and you do want to get these games, and let's say they do end up being multiplayer over the internet, you're going to have to buy them again.
2472946	2475848	Even if you bought them for five bucks the first time on the Wii, you're going to have to buy them again.
2476448	2481750	But for the early adopters, now you're kind of in this, well, I can't really get mad because I'm still going to get it for free.
2482030	2484891	But DarkSakura, let's say the multiplayer thing pans out.
2484971	2487212	Let's say it ends up that you can play it on the internet.
2487732	2488972	Now does that change your opinion?
2489032	2491893	Or are you still like, no, at the end of the day, I'm saving 80 bucks.
2492013	2492954	I don't care about multiplayer.
2494134	2494715	I really don't.
2495575	2497456	So that's just okay good.
2497736	2498597	I'm glad for other people.
2499217	2499738	But I don't care.
2500798	2501158	That's me.
2502179	2502599	Fair enough.
2502899	2503200	Fair enough.
2503500	2507062	Keep in mind how few times I've done any multiplayer game on Xbox Live.
2508043	2516107	Or I think the last multiplayer game I've played that involved a Nintendo system was playing Super Mario Brothers.
2517228	2529985	and then that I didn't really like it with the multiplayer aspect so because I was just like stop being stupid just let me play by myself you know I was just getting annoyed so I do not play well with others
2531078	2537660	Now, I want to emphasize, we don't know for sure yet if multiplayer means multiplayer on the internet.
2538060	2550764	We're all forming a prayer circle right now that, for those of us that are into multiplayer, we're all forming a prayer circle that Nintendo's going to do the right thing, and they are going to open up the internet, because if the emulation scene's been able to do it for years, there's no reason Nintendo cannot open these games to play on the internet.
2551105	2558227	However, we should only expect that multiplayer means within the same room, which is still interesting...
2560481	2560901	I guess.
2561221	2568885	I don't know if I would repay $5 for these games for that alone, but if Nintendo's going to hand them to me for free, I'm not exactly going to bash them.
2569185	2569786	You know what I mean?
2571186	2572907	And then here's another interesting thing.
2573007	2584393	Apparently Satori Iwata, he's gone ahead and taken a 50% reduction in pay as a result of the 3DS's slow sales.
2584773	2585073	What?!
2586154	2587154	Who are you people?!
2587315	2589176	Nintendo, I don't even know you anymore!
2589816	2591397	You're taking pay cuts now?!
2593498	2609148	Other representative directors, including senior managing directors Miyamoto and Shinji Hatano are taking a 30% pay cut and other executives will lose 20% off their salaries.
2610588	2613150	I bet you anything that will not happen to Nintendo U.S.,
2614446	2616427	I think they said Reggie's one of the affected people, right?
2617568	2618789	Uh, no.
2618929	2619569	Oh, interesting.
2620290	2620990	I didn't pick up on that.
2621010	2626493	Doing something like that is honestly... It is the corporate equivalent of falling on your sword.
2627294	2628614	It's very much a Japanese thing.
2629055	2629335	Oh, yeah.
2630095	2634598	To take responsibility for the sake of the whole company.
2635888	2637329	If only Congress would do that.
2637449	2638310	I know, right?
2639911	2651100	In the scope of a week, we've gone from kicking Nintendo, fuck you Nintendo, Operation Rainfall for life, fuck you, I hate you too, oh my god, Congress needs to look at what Nintendo's doing.
2652741	2653682	This all happened in a week.
2654302	2654603	I know.
2656044	2660267	Honestly, every politician needs to take a look at what Nintendo's doing.
2660960	2662241	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
2662921	2678609	Before we start talking about what Congress needs to start emulating from Nintendo, we're still not over the fact that they botched all this stuff up with the Wii and all the online and not bringing games over and whatnot.
2679129	2680970	But this is a very effective diversion.
2681410	2682671	Let me put it this way.
2682811	2686253	Sony, they made a multi-million dollar...
2688574	2693818	Error, if you will, in their online security, and I got two games for it.
2694698	2697520	Nintendo, to make up for dropping... You got four games.
2697540	2700862	You know you work the system, just like the rest of us did with the multi-accounts.
2702464	2709788	To be fair, you got two PS3 games, two PSP games... I did not actually do it on my other... Alright, well, whatever.
2710109	2710629	It doesn't matter.
2710889	2712030	It doesn't matter.
2713331	2715512	And then, you know, we get... Okay, four games.
2715712	2715913	Fine.
2717013	2717934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2732541	2733482	or our 20 free games.
2734402	2735162	Now here's the best part.
2735202	2737844	If you really want to game the system, here's what you do.
2738624	2745828	You go to a Best Buy or a Walmart or something like that just before August 12th.
2746208	2748529	You buy a system for the full price.
2748830	2755073	You log it onto Nintendo's network and then when it drops the price two days later, you come in and go, what the hell?
2755453	2756474	Why this drop in price?
2756774	2758275	I want a refund.
2758415	2761077	And they will refund you the difference in price.
2761257	2769283	If these companies are smart, which I'm not saying they are, but if they're smart, they're going to put an exemption to their policy like just a couple weeks before.
2769923	2770303	Watch.
2770964	2772705	At least one of these stores is going to do that.
2772745	2776628	They're going to say 3DS accepted from the policy from X to Y day.
2776648	2783793	They're going to wait until right that first day that the refund... If it's like a 21-day window, they'll wait until... Well, I guess we would be in that window, but...
2784534	2789361	I don't know what the windows are depending on what store you shop at, but I bet some of them are going to throw up an exception.
2789802	2794469	Maybe not something as huge as Walmart, but I bet you some of these other stores will.
2794770	2799257	At the very least, if those games are interesting to you.
2799837	2800517	Thanks for watching!
2823283	2849547	So Loki, sometimes your thoughts on Nintendo really confuse the hell out of me because you imported a 3DS from Japan just so you could have it before anybody else and you were an early adopter of Nintendo and I know you were an early adopter of Wii as well but then Nintendo does things that really piss you off and you've screamed and you've yelled at them here on the show so surely you must have seen the news this week and gone, what is this?
2849647	2850228	What is going on?
2850248	2852848	What was your reaction to all the news this week and where are you at now?
2853416	2855958	My reaction was like, wow, I'm surprised they're dropping it this early.
2856739	2861123	I'm like, I guess that's an admission that it's not selling well, which we all knew.
2861863	2864946	And then I wasn't angry about it.
2865286	2868909	The only thing about these 20 free games is that it's kind of cool.
2869029	2875935	At least I'll have something that I can put on my memory card that I can play because I'm not fucking buying any of those virtual console games.
2876416	2878097	I'm not paying money for that kind of stuff.
2878137	2878558	Hell no.
2879478	2879518	Um...
2880459	2883281	So, that's kind of cool that I'll have something to fill up my memory card with.
2883741	2889984	But, at the same time, you know, dropping the price of the system doesn't make any of the good games come out any sooner.
2890644	2895647	I mean, because, you know, what, they announced a couple games, you know, out this year.
2896307	2898308	A new Mario, a Mario Kart, and stuff like that.
2898368	2903491	But, I mean, I've seen the videos of Mario Kart, and I was just kind of, eh.
2903691	2905472	They added hang gliders in underwater.
2905832	2907092	Big fucking deal.
2907513	2909354	You know, it's not that exciting.
2909694	2909894	So...
2912498	2919974	I'll have something to download for free but it's definitely not going to get me to buy more things and it's definitely not going to get me to buy crappy games that are out there now.
2922889	2925530	I'm glad I'll have a use to dust off my system.
2926450	2930572	Because I was looking at it sitting on the coffee table, not being charged or anything, just sitting there.
2930912	2933293	I'm like, well, I don't know.
2934233	2936334	Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.
2936374	2939135	Technus in our chatroom says, right, Nintendo running America.
2939235	2942377	That means they will just rehash the same laws and not make new ones.
2942897	2944158	Isn't that kind of what's happening now?
2944238	2945778	Like nobody wants to do something different?
2945978	2947339	That's where we're at right now.
2947379	2949680	But anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to get controversial.
2950200	2954741	Salacious Pop in our chat says, what I want to know is, will DSi XL get a price drop too now?
2955221	2960583	Very interesting that that is completely absent, but I would think logically it has to, right?
2960603	2962403	Because isn't the DSi XL right now $179?
2963043	2964444	I don't remember.
2964544	2966144	I thought they've already dropped the price of that stuff.
2966184	2967684	I know they did the regular DS.
2967824	2978327	But even, I mean, logically, if the 3DS is coming down that low, XL and the rest of them, if they're not fading into obscurity altogether, are going to have to get some type of price cut.
2978427	2981588	Like, XL ought to come down to $129, if not less.
2982609	2984009	But, I don't know.
2984309	2991772	There's also a part of me that kind of thinks like, well, why wouldn't Nintendo just get rid of all the old DSs altogether and say, buy a 3DS or get GTFO?
2992893	2994854	I mean, and could you really blame them for doing that?
2995214	2998415	I mean, you would still have the current inventory on shelves now.
2998715	3002977	We'll get their prices slashed to get it off the shelves and make room for more 3DSs, but...
3004534	3005555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3022071	3022832	Nintendo 3DS Launch Lineup
3042850	3043391	Thank you.
3043491	3044492	That's where I'm coming from.
3044592	3051039	And I'm reading things on the internet that are like, oh, Sony was ready to give Nintendo Rumble and stuff.
3051120	3055925	And I'm not trying to hate on the Vita, but I also don't see where it's in much better of a position right now.
3055965	3059689	All the announced titles that they've got coming out right now aren't that exciting.
3059849	3061111	Uncharted.
3061551	3063594	That's their one big, huge thing they got.
3064366	3082134	Yeah, the other ones, like, I could give... I couldn't give a crap about whatever the hell that game, the puzzle game is, where they're, like, really showing off the back-touch stuff, or... You know, I don't need another fucking rehash of goddamn, you know, uh... Was it, uh... Well, LittleBigPlanet, for one.
3082154	3083255	I mean, yeah, great.
3083355	3084515	You know, LittleBigPlanet's coming out.
3085015	3085215	But...
3087016	3087516	I don't care.
3087596	3088017	I just don't care.
3106161	3130062	I don't know, it's I just think, you know, and don't get me wrong I want a Vita, I'm gonna buy a Vita at launch, I will, I mean, I just I'm a techno person, I have to have it all, but and there are a couple games on Vita I do want, there was that one music game that Miklatov was talking about on one of the E3 specials that I want to get, and then there's that dungeon game that probably won't be out at launch but I know down the road I'll want to get that
3130502	3132004	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3146258	3148099	What won Christmas five years ago?
3148339	3148860	The Wii.
3149300	3150981	What won Christmas last year?
3151061	3151721	The Kinect.
3151981	3153742	Who was the target audience of both of those?
3154163	3155944	Oprah Watchers.
3156104	3158365	I think it's going to be the same story this year.
3158925	3169611	The performance from March to now isn't really going to matter when it comes to the holidays and all the kids everywhere want the 3DS to play Mario and watch 3D movies on.
3169711	3170412	I mean, the 3DS...
3171112	3176776	Kind of has a lot going for it And I gotta think also that some people Well, a lot of people probably thought Hey, you know what?
3177056	3192606	Nintendo's probably gonna drop the price of the 3DS Before holiday Because, you know, it's not doing that well Or, I mean, even if it was doing alright They still wanna, you know, incentivize people for, you know, buying the system I mean, I think a lot of people are like Well, you know what?
3192626	3197730	There's not a lot of good games out right now I'm just gonna wait And waiting paid off for ya
3199153	3202194	I'm just saying, imagine you're a soccer mom.
3202254	3204215	Now I know, just hear me out here for a minute.
3204275	3207217	Imagine you're a soccer mom and you don't know anything about games.
3208157	3213239	But you know there's this one system that's $250 that I guess does some type of back touch thing.
3213700	3217481	But then there's this other system over here that's $80 less and it does 3D.
3218982	3219342	Mario.
3220183	3221143	And it has Mario on it.
3222364	3225185	Which you remember some of your friends liking when you were in junior high school.
3226693	3228974	which is where the soccer moms are at now, right?
3229434	3233957	So, I mean, like, I'm not trying to, again, I'm not trying to knock the Vita.
3234057	3240000	I think it's going to be huge with the college crowd and the young 20s and, you know, more adult gamers, if you will.
3240160	3243901	It'll still be huge with them and the fact that it's a, you know, all-in-one in the pocket.
3243921	3252586	But I think when it comes down to the actual sales, I think what shows up under those Christmas trees and Hanukkah menorahs and so forth are going to be 3DSs.
3253466	3254787	Do you put your presents under the menorah?
3255287	3255767	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3280908	3283730	I get you guys presents because I know that you celebrate Christmas.
3284550	3285410	Well, you know.
3285510	3287071	And I like presents because I'm greedy.
3287892	3288532	There you go.
3288792	3289373	And special.
3289553	3291914	There you go.
3291974	3292714	Going to our chat room.
3293415	3296957	Laha in the chat room says, I think the parents didn't like the 3D.
3297057	3299498	Something about not wanting to mess up their kids' eyes.
3300619	3301939	But what about, okay, look at the movies.
3302620	3305181	Dude, Smurfs 3D is like top of the box office.
3305441	3306982	3D really bugs my eyes.
3307462	3309704	I hate looking at the world in 3D.
3309864	3311785	It really hurts my eye.
3311885	3313086	Actually, I will tell you something.
3313426	3314746	I know what Laha's referring to.
3314807	3317308	It's those studies about the kids' eyes and so forth.
3317628	3320810	Honestly, the 3DS itself is not true 3D.
3320850	3321571	It's lenticular.
3322431	3325353	And that can cause some issues with vision.
3325753	3327254	I mean, it gives me a headache.
3327394	3329935	I can't play a 3DS for very long without getting a headache.
3331336	3333818	The first day it gave me a headache, but now it's fine.
3335357	3357772	Bridge Racer was unplayable it was just completely unplayable I've actually been using the 3DS a little bit as a Netflix device like it's kind of nice to just have it like you know when you're like lying in bed but you're not really ready to go to sleep like it's kind of nice to just be able to you know have the thing there to watch Netflix funny enough I have an iPhone which I could use but I don't know usually that's on the charger so the 3DS just kind of works
3358792	3361715	Yeah, you know, I guess they do have a point with the 3D thing.
3361876	3364098	I mean, that's really gonna torpedo their sales.
3364358	3368223	If only they had the forethought to, you know, put in a slider or something to turn the 3D off.
3370405	3370846	If only.
3371827	3373229	Sorry, Nintendo, maybe next time.
3374510	3374851	Alright.
3376292	3402218	And TigerClawInChat is correcting me saying Smurfs and Cowboy and Aliens are sharing the number one spot this week But the reason why the Smurfs is even tied in the first place is that it has those extra 3D ticket sales Because let's face it, no one over the age of 11 wanted to see the Smurfs movie I still want to see Cowboys and Aliens I'm very torn about the Smurfs movie because I really like Neil Patrick Harris But I really hate everything else about that movie
3402651	3408360	I love Hank Azaria and he's Gargamel, but I am not fucking sitting through that movie.
3408380	3408881	I'm sorry.
3408901	3410945	He does, however, look just like freaking Gargamel, doesn't he?
3411706	3412327	I will give you that.
3412788	3414590	Why are we talking about the Smurfs movie?
3414610	3415552	Fuck this conversation.
3417662	3418583	But you know what, though?
3418603	3422987	The Muppets movie, there's a lot of the cast from How I Met Your Mother.
3423027	3424549	Fuck yes to the Muppets movie.
3425049	3425670	I can't wait.
3426491	3427492	That's going to be amazing.
3427832	3429174	100% yes to the Muppets movie.
3429454	3430715	100% no to the Smurfs movie.
3431176	3432156	Smurfs is terrible.
3433398	3434118	What else is terrible?
3434199	3434379	What?
3434559	3435860	Since we're on this tangent train.
3436361	3436661	Okay.
3436981	3437702	Battleship.
3437842	3439224	What the fuck is that?
3439244	3440144	Oh my god!
3441326	3444348	Oh my god, that movie looks a special kind of terrible.
3444488	3444928	I saw that.
3445049	3449131	You posted the trailer on the Facebook, and I think my comment was, quote, this looks like shit.
3450132	3452033	No, Dan showed it to me, and my reply was, what?
3452754	3453814	I'm like, I'm sorry.
3454215	3457037	Last time I played Battleship, I didn't.
3457377	3463861	And the way the trailer looked, like with the configuration of the ships, I was literally expecting Leonison to shout out, I-7-
3466400	3469402	and Rihanna to go, girl, you shunk my battleship.
3469482	3470482	That's what they're setting up.
3470642	3473344	It's just like, well, our radar's out.
3473484	3477786	We have this satellite imagery that we're going to use to plot where we fire stuff.
3478126	3481968	And the enemies, you know, whatever their missiles or whatever, they're the pegs.
3482268	3487051	They spent money, lots and lots of money on that movie.
3487491	3492374	And what really freaks me out is that they bought the rights to all these other board games too.
3492414	3494015	They want to do a new Clue movie.
3494095	3494515	And I'm like,
3495015	3508822	Oh my god, no, no, no, no The one in the 80s was perfect It's a cult classic It's Tim Curry at his finest Second finest next to Furter Third finest next to Furter And Pennywise
3510331	3514373	Fourth finest next to Furter, Pennywise, and whatever, and Annie.
3514813	3514993	What?
3515253	3516534	Oh, what about the demon in Labyrinth?
3516554	3517054	God damn it.
3517094	3518014	Okay, fifth finest.
3518154	3518774	Let's just face it.
3518814	3519895	Tim Curry is always awesome.
3519935	3520715	Every movie he touches is amazing.
3520875	3522776	Even in The Worst Witch, he was awesome.
3523316	3527798	So, like, don't make Clue like Battleship.
3527998	3528818	I will cry.
3529879	3535921	Like, I just expect this scene of Miss Peacock walking these little squares in the, like, oh my god.
3536622	3540125	And then all of a sudden aliens come from outer space and destroy everything.
3540145	3545511	Den doing Laundromat says, you sunk my battleshit.
3545531	3546652	You sunk my battleshit.
3547152	3550355	Yeah, and Ism said, you sunk my box office sales.
3550776	3552558	And Frisbee says, you sunk my PT boat.
3554003	3554484	Uh, yeah.
3554644	3555564	Oh, Yahtzee movie.
3555604	3556505	Good idea, Sterlok.
3557125	3563969	Okay, TigerClaw on chat says, you know, despite what you see in the trailer, it could be a fun popcorn movie if you ignore the fact it's based on a board game.
3564530	3568172	Go watch the trailer again and then come back and tell me that.
3568292	3569773	Maybe it could be snakes on the plane.
3570593	3573655	Maybe getting high will be fun.
3574456	3576917	Like the first half of the trailer, don't get me wrong, I was like, okay, this is
3577017	3577497	Thanks for watching!
3604076	3605878	I just picture this trailer in my mind.
3605898	3606079	Monopoly?
3606099	3609683	I just picture Russell Brand sitting in a top hat and a monocle going, I'll get out of jail free called.
3623161	3624663	Monopoly, Ouija.
3624823	3627847	They're doing a new Ouija movie.
3629569	3632773	Is it going to be like, what was the best Ouija movie ever?
3633233	3634294	Maybe The Exorcist.
3636517	3636877	Seriously.
3637158	3638619	How about Witch Board?
3638639	3640742	That movie was based off of Ouija board.
3640982	3641663	How about Witch Board?
3643760	3646141	Anyhow, alright, I don't want to talk about these horrible movies anymore.
3646421	3651622	Although it is related to games, every single one of these movies will have a game tie-in to it, you better believe it.
3651922	3658585	So there will be something on the Wii that you can get for the Battleship movie that'll be, you know, Liam Neeson yelling, I7!
3659545	3662386	I do, by the way, have to quote something from Tumblr.
3663666	3669128	If you watch The Exorcist Backwards, it's about a girl who's really sick and then eats some pea soup and gets better.
3670408	3682909	shut up I'll bring it up later but I'm trying to find that list of movies that they have maybe we'll save it for like the afterbirth or something but it's terrible I know
3684648	3686809	All right, can we move on?
3707618	3711219	All this other news that just kind of showed up in the press releases.
3711319	3715020	Like the fact that original NES games were coming to virtual console.
3715260	3718981	That just was kind of, oh yeah, well since we're giving them away, we're just going to throw that out there.
3719001	3720382	I have to point out something to Laha.
3720622	3720862	Okay.
3721102	3722562	There was a Dungeons & Dragons movie.
3723383	3724383	It was pretty bad.
3724463	3725823	Tom Baker was in it, however.
3726323	3729444	Yeah, the kid from Serial Mom was in it.
3729724	3731525	There was a sequel, by the way.
3733245	3757532	and just to let you know, the movie Krull that came out when I was pretty young I saw it in the theater, I'll put it that way was supposed to be the Dungeons & Dragons movie and they lost the license for it so Dungeons & Dragons has been done for the record though, I did kind of like the Dungeons & Dragons movie Dungeons & Dragons, you will believe that a Wayans can be an elf
3758700	3759140	Super Mario 3D Land
3781573	3789035	No further information still on Kid Icarus, which is also supposed to be this holiday, but they haven't exactly said when that is.
3789135	3792076	And now there's a little bit of concern that maybe it's not going to make this year.
3792096	3793477	You know the best part about Mario Kart 7?
3794397	3796818	According to Kotaku, it's actually the ninth Mario Kart game.
3798418	3799038	Is it really?
3799058	3799579	Yes, it is.
3799759	3801039	What games did they forget?
3801319	3801899	Arcade ones.
3803740	3806520	Nintendo didn't really develop the arcade ones.
3806560	3807821	Didn't Namco do those?
3807901	3809581	It's still Mario Kart.
3809961	3812342	There was a Pac-Man movie, by the way, but it was animated.
3812542	3813982	They would not be considered canon.
3814542	3818463	I would support calling it Mario Kart 7 because the arcade ones are not canon.
3818723	3819944	They're not as good, either.
3820824	3821544	They're really not.
3822064	3823985	They're okay for arcade games, I guess, but...
3824625	3827006	They're not the same quality as the home ones.
3827306	3831828	And unlike Loki, I love me some Mario Kart and I am looking forward to this new one.
3831868	3835769	As long as it's not Double Dash bad, then I am looking forward to the new one.
3837010	3841272	I did actually have to point out that just about everything that Lahaz suggested, there actually have been movies.
3842332	3843232	There was a Pac-Man movie.
3843292	3843913	It was animated.
3845153	3846814	There was a Pac-Man TV show back in the day.
3846834	3847374	Yes, there was.
3847454	3848314	It was the same series.
3848354	3849455	The movie was in the same series.
3849475	3851796	There's also Pac-Man Save Santa Claus.
3853427	3855569	Hey, I watched it.
3855589	3857510	You know what my two shows were when I was a kid?
3857530	3858651	It was Pac-Man and Q-Bert.
3859171	3860592	I watched the Q-Bert cartoon too.
3861893	3863634	Alright, let's move on.
3864195	3867577	Candyland was also one of the other licenses that they had.
3869418	3871720	It was Monopoly Battleship, Candyland, and Ouija.
3871900	3874362	Great, I hope Patrick Stewart stars in Candyland.
3879642	3884811	set course for yellow square engage Spock is not impressed
3886631	3889493	So, uh... Did they get Chutes and Ladders, too?
3889513	3890853	Alright.
3891173	3892334	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
3892394	3893354	How about HiHoCherryO?
3894235	3894435	Okay.
3894495	3895155	How about a story?
3895455	3896215	This is stupid.
3896696	3898556	And I'm gonna say why it's stupid after I read it.
3898596	3906480	Basically, the ESA wants $1.1 million reimbursement from the state of California for the law that failed.
3907140	3908140	Basically, it's for Brown v. EMA.
3908160	3908240	Okay.
3910061	3933903	and basically the whole point is that and this is a quote California persisted in defending a law that plaintiffs warned of the legislature was unconstitutional before it passed that was previously found to be unconstitutional by the district court and a unanimous panel of the Ninth Circuit and that is similar to at least eight other laws invalidated as unconstitutional prior to the time California sought seriatory in this case
3935024	3940186	So basically, you knew, but you pursued it anyway because you're stupid?
3940266	3940686	Pay us.
3941246	3943067	We spent a lot of money beating your ass.
3943347	3943727	Pay us.
3945608	3951270	Now, California did send a check for $282,794 for reimbursement for legal fees.
3951330	3952490	However, we're broke in California.
3962298	3963619	That's kind of where I'm at.
3963719	3973588	I'm like, yeah, ESA kind of deserves it, but at the same time, we don't have the money right now, so you just need to... I'm going to tell you what's going to happen, ESA.
3973648	3975470	Listen to me, representatives of the ESA.
3975530	3977312	This is what's going to happen if you get your money.
3978213	3987161	They're going to find another tax to raise or increase our tuition again or do something else, and it's going to hurt the people that pretty much fund your operation.
3989516	3991417	This is so hard because I can see it from both sides.
3991697	3997200	The ESA spent a lot of money defending something that should have never been a law in the first place.
3997720	3998940	They were defending our rights.
3999641	4002562	And so it's kind of like they should be entitled to that money.
4002662	4004063	But I am with you.
4004523	4007644	I know damn well that money is not going to come out of thin air.
4007965	4008645	And there's so much...
4008985	4010025	It doesn't need to come out of thin air.
4010045	4014947	It needs to come out of fucking Leland Yee's ass is where it needs to fucking come from.
4015207	4016808	I think that's where the money should come from.
4016908	4017508	Absolutely.
4017668	4019329	They need to take it right from the source.
4020289	4021630	I would support that.
4021710	4031253	I honestly think that any of these politicians that have basically brought up anything like this that have failed that spent our taxpayer dollars because you know he didn't pay anything out of pocket for any of this shit.
4032600	4039107	Anything that comes out of our pockets as taxpayers, the ones responsible for the failed law need to pay it themselves.
4057004	4057545	Well, you know what?
4057585	4065730	This is actually something, because here in California, basically, we are pretty much a direct democracy here.
4065790	4067751	We can vote on what we want.
4068431	4072394	All you have to do is have enough signatures to put it on the ballot, and it can be voted on.
4073294	4096674	and this is something that I would seriously sit back and pen and I've got friends that will review the legal side of it for me for free this is something that I would sit back and pen myself that a politician needs to be responsible for anything they do that fails if they cost the taxpayer money on a failed venture then it needs to come out of their personal pocket or they need to have a cut and pay
4096994	4105100	I don't want to get too political, but you wouldn't want to scare off a politician from doing something that maybe they really should be doing.
4105961	4109243	There's a middle ground somewhere.
4109644	4113787	And you're right, but you have to be very careful in how you word something like that.
4114287	4119113	is that the court should be able to find the person liable when gross negligence is shown.
4119574	4122557	There needs to be something that the judge could do it.
4123619	4131609	You wouldn't want all politicians to have to suffer because of people constantly going after rights and things like that.
4132009	4132689	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4150675	4153356	They're still out there.
4154216	4156377	And again, we're broke in California.
4157037	4165480	We have no money, even though we have some of the highest grossing income people in the country that live in our state.
4166340	4170282	Are they being taxed relatively any more than we are?
4171162	4174287	No, because of Republicans.
4174587	4184821	Anyway, but I'm saying that when you come to the point that we don't have any more money to pay on any of this, and they're still going and pursuing stuff that they know is going to cost us money.
4186924	4187445	What's the point?
4189517	4190958	I mean, when is that going to stop?
4190978	4192138	They're going to keep doing stupid shit.
4192158	4195500	Just look at all the dumb laws they have in San Francisco.
4196661	4197161	Seriously.
4197822	4198002	Yeah.
4198802	4200023	And they were going to try to ban circumcision.
4200043	4203044	The whole circumcision thing that went on the ballot and had to be thrown out.
4203064	4209728	I think it was thrown out by a judge that it's not going to be on the ballot because it was just too ridiculous or whatever legal thing they decided.
4209828	4212590	And besides that, it would infringe on religious rights.
4213070	4213250	Yeah.
4214150	4214330	Right.
4215531	4217593	But I mean, it's just so... But it's like, who paid for that?
4218153	4219614	Who paid for that whole process?
4219755	4226420	They pay... The reason why I think it's so expensive to live in San Francisco is because they have a bunch of ridiculous laws that aren't necessary.
4227060	4228782	None of us elsewhere have to deal with it.
4228862	4230523	Just in San Francisco, they have this shit.
4231524	4237328	But, I mean, I don't want to get too political here, but some could look and say, hmm, in San Francisco, everyone has health care.
4238229	4238489	We'll see.
4238650	4239710	Okay, that's one I agree with.
4239790	4241532	But I'm saying there's other...
4242890	4243170	Anyhow.
4243890	4244211	Alright.
4245271	4249093	We gotta not... I think Jamie needs a spin-off show that's political.
4250373	4252294	No, because then I would be hoarse and have a headache.
4252354	4253234	Called Stitchin' Bitch.
4253294	4253595	Alright.
4254095	4254755	Let's move on.
4255916	4257756	Loki, what do you have for us?
4257997	4258577	Back to gaming.
4259197	4270142	GameStop is now prepared to offer downloadable PC purchases at retail, much like they do right now with digital purchases for DLC and stuff like that.
4270682	4270762	Uh,
4272483	4275244	I mean, great if you want to do that.
4275424	4279505	I mean, if you're trading used items for download content or something like that.
4279525	4289908	But, I mean, much like I don't see the point in download content being purchased at retail, I don't really see the point of buying a digital PC title at retail.
4289988	4297391	I mean, shit, if you're going to go to retail to buy a digital title, like, say, any game that's out there now that's...
4298311	4301512	I think GameCroc's just trying to do what they have to do to stay relevant, but it ain't gonna work.
4317674	4318675	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4341061	4344883	I mean, I guess that's cool if you want all those extras.
4345523	4348325	I mean, I know Steam does a lot of extras like that as well.
4349205	4355108	I guess it's just really... If that's important to you, then I'd go that route.
4355148	4363552	But if you're just looking to buy digital stuff... I mean, it's kind of like the whole point of buying digital in the first place is so you don't have to go to the store.
4364153	4368935	But I guess if you're young enough and you don't have a credit card or something like that, then that may be the only way to go.
4369695	4369916	But...
4370976	4371438	But whatever, you know
4374616	4375476	That's what they want to do.
4376196	4378217	Power to the players, as they say.
4379177	4383439	It would be really neat if I could get into the used game market with this stuff.
4383499	4391561	I should be able to Steam revoke my access to a game and I get a credit to use on the store and then somebody else can buy the game at a reduced price or something.
4392381	4400404	I know that will never happen, but if you think about it, they could do something where the publisher would get a cut of that, and that doesn't happen right now in the retail stores.
4401548	4406970	There could be a way, if publishers were smarter about the used game market, where they could get a cut of it.
4408990	4411051	And I'm not just talking these $10 online passes.
4411831	4413692	But, whatever.
4415152	4416653	Anyhow, moving on.
4416713	4420074	Speaking of prices, Xbox Live Arcade.
4420094	4422435	Have you noticed something about the games on Xbox Live Arcade?
4422915	4426196	Yeah, the points have been slowly rising.
4426256	4429457	That's right, the cost of the games have been rising on Xbox Live Arcade.
4430038	4446695	so far in 2011 there have been 20 1200 plus games last year 27 of the 85 games released for the service cost 1200 points or more so we're already at 20 for this year so that was an 8% increase in itself over 2009 when 21 titles hit that price point
4449377	4456661	Now, they are saying that, you know, well, we have to blame the fact that the quality of games we're basically making is a lot higher too.
4457161	4460503	Limbo and Castle Crashers, they're as good as anything else that's out on the market.
4461203	4462824	So, what do you guys think?
4462904	4467807	Do you think that Xbox Live Arcade games are getting better and therefore they're worth the extra money?
4468347	4471749	Or do you think this is just inflation when we're not paying attention?
4473649	4474490	I think it's inflation.
4476646	4505227	I think it's a little bit of a mix of both I think yes it's inflation going on but at the same time you really don't see any more like just crappy lazy arcade ports ever since Xbox or Microsoft kind of banned those from the service like you don't see any more of this just re-release of an old ass game that's you know 400 Microsoft points most of the stuff that's coming out now definitely had a lot of development dollars put into it with mixed success some of it's really good some of it's not so good it just depends on what kind of games you're into
4506621	4507681	I think it's a little bit of both.
4507941	4508562	And you know what?
4508582	4509442	That's fine.
4509542	4510722	They want to put out $20 games.
4513143	4514784	Because you don't have to buy them.
4515444	4516724	No one's forcing you to buy them.
4516904	4517384	And you know what?
4517424	4518625	If you're smart, you wait.
4519065	4523526	And then sometimes when that game pops up onto the deal of the week, then you buy it for a cheaper price.
4523846	4524527	And I still do.
4524667	4527067	I will say one thing I do love is that you still get the demos.
4527607	4531149	And that's something you can't always get at a retail store.
4531689	4533309	So that is one thing I really like.
4533869	4535730	And I can really, really try a game before I buy it.
4537546	4542270	So Xbox Live Arcade, even though the prices are creeping up, as long as the quality stays good.
4542290	4544492	I mean, there's been a lot of good arcade games I've played lately.
4544932	4545713	I guess it's okay.
4546314	4546914	So we'll see.
4547274	4547735	Dark Sakura.
4548669	4551650	Well, in other news, this actually is for our UK listeners.
4551810	4555812	The shop game restarted its Play Now, Trade Later deal.
4556452	4561674	So basically, you can buy a game and trade it in at a guaranteed amount.
4562074	4566216	So you essentially end up paying five pounds for your game.
4567036	4569457	And the games that are included on this list is...
4571598	4579921	UFC Trainer for Wii, Cars 2 on DS, Art Academy, Call of Juarez the Cartel, Hunted, The Demon's Forge, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2 for Wii.
4580601	4584463	So it's a number of games you'd have to check with your local game store to find out.
4584903	4591366	Basically, if you trade in any of those games for credit before August 12th, they'll effectively cost £5.
4593026	4595548	You can use the credit on any future purchase.
4595968	4598890	So that's pretty good.
4598930	4603253	I mean, it's a good way to save money, especially if these are games that you got and you're kind of like, eh, meh.
4603774	4608177	Sounds like a really weird way of doing like a demo or like a rental service.
4608837	4615061	Well, in February, they also had one where it guaranteed a 35-pound trade-in for shooters like Killzone 3 and Bulletstorm.
4616462	4619665	So it's a good way to basically refill stock.
4620565	4620725	So.
4621586	4621706	Hmm.
4622830	4624231	Well, we'll see how successful this is.
4624331	4624672	I don't know.
4624752	4626974	None of those games are making me go, ooh, gotta get it.
4627474	4630357	I mean, granted, I live in the wrong country anyway, but we'll see.
4631378	4632199	Oh, good luck.
4633780	4641367	All right, well, let's travel the world and talk about release dates and what upcoming games you could maybe get a five-pound deal or five-dollar deal on later.
4643816	4645317	Well, not a whole lot this week.
4645757	4649759	At least there's some games coming out this week.
4649779	4652640	There's a few weeks coming up here where there's nothing.
4653721	4656522	Starting off, Phineas and Ferb Across the Second Dimension.
4656822	4657702	I love Phineas and Ferb.
4658643	4661044	It's coming out on PlayStation 3 with Move support.
4661064	4662544	How much is it?
4663845	4664225	I believe $40.
4665466	4667367	Do you love Phineas and Ferb $40 much?
4669363	4670964	I'll just keep watching episodes off the internet.
4692106	4695609	Sesame Street, Ready, Set, Grover coming out on the DS and the Wii.
4696009	4699171	DS version has a funny little Grover stylus.
4699311	4701953	I thought it might be that Kinect game that they were showing at E3.
4701973	4703654	No, no, that got delayed.
4705195	4710119	On the Wii version you get a Grover fuzzy Wii remote cover.
4711800	4713221	Wait, wait, you said that really quick.
4713301	4714081	That got delayed?
4714281	4714942	Delayed to when?
4714962	4715362	Next year?
4717023	4717904	No, just in the fall.
4718804	4719405	Like October.
4720951	4723312	Oh, I guess I thought that was when it was always set to come out.
4724093	4728335	It was August at one point.
4729436	4731077	And then, of course, let's see here.
4735441	4736803	Thanks for watching!
4753026	4755347	Bleach Soul Resurrection for the PlayStation 3.
4755427	4759890	This is going to be kind of like a Dice Warriors type of game.
4760150	4765713	Also, you get three free episodes or the anime episodes on PlayStation Network.
4766053	4767074	You get a voucher for that.
4767094	4767574	It's kind of cool.
4769175	4771756	Sniper Ghost Warrior Extended Edition.
4771816	4772337	That's coming out on 360.
4772457	4773017	And that's it.
4778340	4784827	I love the enthusiasm in the chat room shown by Sterlok at chat.orangelunchradio.com Sterlok says, Yay Grover!
4784947	4786389	He was my favorite when I was a kid.
4786489	4787530	Him and Cookie Monster.
4789913	4795179	Back in my day, Elmo didn't exist on the old school Sesame Street back when I was a kid.
4796521	4798643	Which we like to refer to as the good old days.
4798884	4799344	That's right.
4800125	4802027	Breakman says, I preferred the Muppets.
4802408	4805171	I liked Muppet Babies, but it was always about Fraggle Rock.
4805211	4807013	I don't know about you guys, but anyhow.
4807073	4808475	Fraggle Rock is awesome.
4808723	4810765	Alright, going to Japanese release dates.
4810885	4818030	It's kind of a slow week over there as well, but on the Xbox 360 this week, you get a couple of price reductions, including Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Special Edition and Tropico 3.
4818751	4820412	Both move into the Platinum Collection.
4820432	4822713	That's on the 4th of August on the Xbox 360.
4823254	4830339	Going over to the PlayStation 3, we have Assassin's Creed Brotherhood there as well, and then another game getting a price reduction.
4830679	4831920	This has a whopper of a name.
4832060	4832160	It's
4833201	4841345	R Tonelico 3 Sekai Shuin no Hikigane wa Shujou no Uta ga Hajuku gets a price reduction this week.
4841445	4842685	I have no idea what game this is.
4842845	4843746	It's R Tonelico.
4845026	4854070	It's a role-playing game and of course it looks like you can dress the little girls up as bunnies in the game and I can see a little item shop in some of these pictures.
4854490	4856811	I don't know, the game looks kind of cool but I don't think we have this here.
4857152	4858032	Yeah, we do.
4858092	4859213	Not number three, I don't think.
4859253	4859993	We have number two at least.
4860013	4860553	What game is this?
4860633	4861934	It's R Tonelico.
4862814	4864534	Oh, I didn't know that was out here.
4864774	4865535	Yeah, it's out here.
4865895	4866415	Oh, there you go.
4866435	4867155	It looks interesting.
4867215	4867815	Maybe I'll check it out.
4868235	4869455	All right, let's see.
4869475	4870515	Moving on to other consoles.
4870655	4875196	I don't know if Nintendo has anything on their lineup, but I will check.
4876837	4877997	But I can do the PSP.
4878097	4879277	We do have a couple games there.
4879317	4884878	We have Storm Lover, Summer Love from D3, Toriyoko, Gourmet Survival.
4886058	4887659	What is that, like Iron Chef or Dai?
4888599	4889739	Gourmet Survival!
4889759	4890159	Gourmet Survival!
4890579	4891019	Man vs. Beast
4909631	4910352	That's what that is.
4911513	4917361	That's on the BSP this week as well as Yusha 32nd from Marvelous comes out this week as well.
4917381	4920264	I wonder if that's a version of 32nd Hero or Half Minute Hero.
4920324	4920785	Oh, yes, it is.
4920845	4923628	It's Half Minute Hero Part 2 comes out this week in Japan.
4923668	4924369	That could be a lot of fun.
4925931	4927212	So that's on the PSP this week.
4927613	4933799	And going to the Nintendo Wii, Epic Mickey gets a release in Japan this week, finally.
4933900	4935381	So they must have localized it for Japan.
4935421	4939065	I know Disney's pretty big over there, so they probably took a little while for them to localize it all.
4939085	4940306	They had to add Duffy to it.
4941468	4941768	Maybe.
4942048	4943890	Because Duffy is bigger than Mickey in Japan.
4944191	4944791	Is it really?
4945071	4946253	Actually, Duffy is pretty big.
4946613	4956632	Family Fishing as well on the Wii and lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Nazo Waku Yakata Oton no Aida ni Ade ni comes out.
4956712	4958936	This looks like, is this a Professor Layton game?
4960925	4961646	It would appear so.
4962366	4966389	So it's Professor Layton's Haunted Mansion or something like that on the 3DS.
4967290	4967810	There you go.
4967870	4969091	Your Japanese release dates.
4969951	4971713	As I horribly butcher the names as I always do.
4971973	4973174	In Europe, two things.
4974074	4978918	Limbo for PC and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet on Xbox 360.
4979018	4980038	That is an awesome game.
4980138	4980459	That's it.
4981019	4981540	It looks monochrome.
5005962	5009071	Well, it's got a unique art style to it.
5010615	5011859	It's insanely twisted.
5015156	5020259	So let's talk a little bit more about earnings and lack thereof.
5020760	5030467	THQ is disappointed in their earnings for Fiscal Quarter 2, including Red Faction and the performance of that.
5031127	5034810	They're thinking, of course, Quarter 3 could be its best.
5035270	5038813	Oh, I'm sorry, it was Quarter 1 instead they were pissed off about.
5039894	5041335	These Fiscal Quarters get confusing.
5043016	5049040	Of course, they were saying sales of Red Faction Armageddon and our licensed kid titles were below expectations.
5049720	5054063	The late release of UFC Personal Trainer also adversely impacted the quarter.
5055284	5055504	You know...
5057265	5063949	THQ, I mean, you had a Kung Fu Panda game come out and you decided to make it U-Draw only.
5065790	5067891	Not a good choice, I gotta say.
5070152	5076515	Of course, they're saying that the net loss of $38.4 million and most of the losses are from deferred revenue.
5077336	5084640	Of course, revenue that the company's not counting yet because it's going towards their online services for its games.
5085700	5095823	and of course Q3 for them is going to be Saints Row the 3rd, WWE 12 and the UDraw tablet for the 360 and PS3 among other things.
5097483	5102665	Red Faction did so poorly that it will not be continuing on in any meaningful way.
5103165	5103385	Ouch.
5103605	5105826	So it is done, fortunately.
5106646	5109967	Breakman is crying in our chat room over the death of Red Faction.
5109987	5110907	How do you feel about it, Loki?
5110927	5111867	Weren't you a fan of that series?
5112047	5112188	Nope.
5113208	5113688	Why not?
5114208	5115249	I just didn't play it.
5115429	5116810	It's not that I don't like it or anything.
5116850	5117530	I mean, it looked cool.
5117750	5119271	It's Volition.
5119351	5119991	I love Volition.
5120031	5122293	So it's part your fault that the series died, basically.
5122313	5123313	Yeah, it's because I didn't buy it.
5123433	5123894	Exactly.
5124234	5129277	So if you are mad about the death of Red Faction, just send those cards and letters to Loki.
5132563	5136069	So yeah, it just didn't do that well.
5136349	5141738	And you would have thought, you know, a game with a unicorn that shoots rainbows out of its ass, that it would have been awesome.
5142099	5147067	Which, by the way, I hope to God that they bring that weapon over to Saints Row III, because that would be amazing.
5148657	5165338	and then of course one of the things that they were experimenting with starting with MX vs. ATV is releasing a game for a lower price point and then hoping to make that money up back with download content so they did try that with MX vs. ATV Alive
5165678	5180889	They put it out at $39.99 and their idea was of course to come out with a robust product at $39.99 price point, build a large install base more quickly, and then monetize that install base to wrap it in a large number of DLC drops.
5182091	5184552	Unfortunately, it didn't work.
5184572	5192256	The only problem is the game didn't move enough units to turn, or in turn, move enough download content to make the experiment a success.
5192936	5199939	So the key to learning was that it was not a successful experiment.
5199959	5207002	The $39.99 price point, while good, gave us good acceleration of sales, but that wasn't enough to drive the install base where we wanted it to be, obviously.
5209143	5213267	It just wasn't working out.
5214367	5216389	Breakman in chat is calling you Darth Loki.
5219151	5221413	He's very upset about this whole Red Faction thing, just so you know.
5221772	5223233	You know who you need to blame?
5224373	5227055	You know who put their logo onto that game?
5228295	5229356	That would be SyFy.
5230477	5233018	SyFy Channel had a fucking movie.
5233438	5235039	It was SyFy Games.
5235879	5239962	If you want to talk about someone putting out a poor product, that would be SyFy.
5242843	5244504	So, that's who you need to blame.
5247504	5249385	So yeah, that kind of sucks.
5249425	5250305	But at least, you know what?
5250545	5255787	I can guarantee that quarter three is going to be amazing because fucking Saints Row the Third, that shit is going to sell like crazy.
5256107	5256347	Nice.
5257308	5264550	All right, well, I got to... There's part of me didn't want to talk about this next story, but this next story just really makes me angry.
5264951	5270533	Like, there's so much to hate in this next story, and I apologize for bringing it up, but you know what?
5270593	5273854	This should piss you off too because you have the power to change things.
5274794	5296750	and as you guys know if you ever watch a television you know that there was a horrible horrible tragedy in Norway this past week and you know you had this just crazy asshole that and I'm not even gonna say his name I'm not gonna show you his picture because he doesn't deserve to have it shown he's a crazy asshole and he blew up a building and he shot a bunch of kids at a camp
5297370	5298311	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5322465	5326486	and what happens when a horrific situation happens?
5326886	5327866	You want to blame something.
5327946	5329647	You want to blame someone, you want to blame something.
5329707	5331487	So why am I bringing it up here on Orange Lounge Radio?
5331747	5332488	Guess what got blamed?
5332968	5333528	Video games.
5333548	5334048	That's right.
5334328	5340029	Norwegian retailers have pulled World of Warcraft and Call of Duty after the shooting.
5340109	5346271	Some of the big retailers because I guess this asshole wrote some manifesto that either talked about the games.
5346511	5350532	I think he had actually said he learned how to shoot or whatever in Call of Duty.
5351132	5373706	which I don't know why you would take what a crazy asshole says at face value but whatever I mean this just infuriates me because it's like don't pay attention to this stupid asshole by banning these games I feel like you're validating what he says and that's the last thing you should do in a situation like this it's so irritating
5375107	5381112	Warcraft provided a useful cover story for the time he spent in seclusion plotting his terrorist attacks.
5388666	5392610	And then playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was a way to keep his skills honed.
5393010	5400538	So the retailers Co-op Norway and Plate Companyet, I can't say these Norwegian names, but something like that, they pulled the games.
5400798	5406424	They are saying it's a temporary removal, but as far as I'm concerned, you know what?
5406924	5408486	Don't validate this guy.
5409807	5410388	Irritating.
5410928	5412029	Now, we will say this.
5412309	5414091	SpaceWorld is another retailer.
5414451	5419836	They refused to pull the games, saying it saw no connection between the games and the tragedy.
5419936	5424760	Quote, we have never seen any research that games alone have led to such incidents.
5425260	5430324	So if you live in Norway, that would be A plus SpaceWorld, F minus these other guys.
5430865	5432366	So, shame on that.
5433667	5435548	But then, of course, it doesn't end there.
5438331	5438831	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5459005	5464446	I don't know if that's the word I would choose to use, but I guess that's what this article is saying here.
5465046	5477068	Clinical psychologist Christopher Ferguson, a leading expert on video game violence and mass killings at Texas A&M International University, said video games aren't to blame for the tragedy, nor is Doom, nor is Quake, and so on.
5477128	5486450	In fact, he believes that placing the blame on video games whenever a white male is guilty of a killing spree is racist.
5489799	5494822	Weird, but I can't say he's totally... I don't know.
5495963	5499806	Keep in mind, keep in mind, and this is something that needs to be defined for the entirety of America.
5500466	5505769	Racism does not mean white against black, white against this.
5505910	5509552	It means one race against another.
5510192	5513935	Or it's making a judgment... Based on racial factors only.
5514415	5514895	Correct.
5515456	5517377	And this time he's saying because...
5517818	5522676	White males commit heinous acts Instantly blaming video games is racist
5525074	5525954	I would say bigoted.
5526995	5527595	That's a better word.
5527615	5530116	Racist just isn't the right word for me.
5530136	5531436	But it is sort of profiling.
5532657	5533337	That's a good word.
5533717	5534197	Profiling.
5535357	5536158	But racist?
5537118	5543820	I think that had to be used for lack of a better, or maybe just for shock value.
5544541	5547902	But it really is profiling and a bit of bigotry.
5548882	5549302	Yeah.
5550102	5550703	That's what it is.
5552023	5556730	and the doctor goes on to say mass killings are going to happen and there's nothing anyone can do about it.
5558081	5581960	fortunately they're not going to happen very often but they're like lightning strikes let's see quote I know it's a little controversial to say but there's a certain type of racism in place of these killings when shootings happen in an inner city in minority populated schools video games are never brought up when these things happen in white majority schools and in the suburbs people start to freak out and video games are inevitably blamed I think that there's a certain element of racism or ignorance here
5583086	5597394	people really want to know what kind of boogeyman we can hang this on and video games are still the top choice when it comes to any type of tragedy if you want to read more on this you can go to blog.forbes.com and read the full article there let me read another quote from this
5598254	5614105	really interesting for lack of a better word there are groups out there who are going to blame video games on everything they're like ambulance chasers really I think it's irresponsible and thoughtless to try to make political gain off of someone else's tragedy but they're going to do it
5614625	5642123	that's what they do but even those groups have been much quieter with the Oslo tragedy and you know we had another follow up story in our show role that I neglected to copy the link for but in a nutshell some crazy religious group is trying to get the games banned here in the US because of the Norway shooting and that quote I agree with these guys are like ambulance chasers to push their own agenda and they are exploiting a disgusting scenario to promote their own agenda and that is sick
5643661	5645062	In that part, I agree with.
5645642	5648864	So, really fascinating study.
5649064	5649384	I don't know.
5649424	5650424	Draw your own opinions.
5650525	5651345	Choose your own words.
5651785	5652886	But, you know.
5653466	5655287	Well, you know what the whole thing is?
5655947	5659669	And this is my little commentary on the whole situation.
5661150	5664332	Stop looking for something to blame other than the people themselves.
5664352	5665692	Yeah.
5665732	5670655	Kaishudo in the chatroom says, Rob, don't jump on the side of one nutcase that goes against another nutcase's view.
5671335	5673376	I'm not totally with this guy.
5673456	5677917	Like I said, I get what he's saying, but I don't know if racism would be the word I'd use.
5677977	5680538	Profiling, like Jamie said, I think is maybe a better word to use.
5680998	5691082	But when he does talk about the ambulance chaser and how people will use these situations to promote their own agendas, I will say, yes, I agree with him on that.
5691942	5696044	Weren't we just talking about politicians and the whole Supreme Court thing earlier?
5696965	5703754	I mean, wasn't that all kind of promoting Leland Yee's own political agenda and continuing to promote his own?
5704555	5707860	I mean, that part, I am with him.
5708141	5711706	And a certain Lord Voldemort wouldn't have done this in the past at all.
5712270	5718760	Well, and that's really, again, I think a failing of society in general.
5719641	5727132	Okay, I think that if you look at things maybe a hundred years ago or look into another culture.
5728582	5733705	People were more likely to own up to what was their mistake.
5734226	5752278	It was considered the mature thing, the honorable thing to do, to own up to your own mistake, to put the blame where it was, to not make those who were circumstantially a part of it pay for it, but those who were specifically responsible for it.
5753298	5754479	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5775891	5777232	I don't care what they did.
5777712	5787019	I don't care if they played My Little Pony while wearing mantis and doing ballet in a little pink frilly tutu.
5787139	5787620	I don't care.
5788420	5789101	I do not care.
5789581	5792043	I don't care that J. Edgar Hoover was a transvestite.
5792123	5792863	He was a bastard.
5793384	5795245	Him being a transvestite had nothing to do with being a bastard.
5795785	5800589	All those things, by the way, that she mentioned before are able to be done in Dead Rising 2 off the record.
5800729	5801209	Yeah.
5802714	5803515	Yes, that is true.
5803555	5809321	Capcom has your weird, sick, twisted fantasies.
5809341	5813726	The word Capcom is still... I have a bad Pavlov's response to that word this week.
5814007	5822696	But my point being is that whatever they did in their private life, whatever they do on the side, has nothing to do...
5824237	5826218	with their final action.
5826838	5832740	It may have been, okay, well, I've done all this and it's led up to this point, but really, it's what goes on in the head.
5833520	5838482	If they're not right in the head, they're not going to do something right to begin with.
5839202	5848546	If they're crazy, okay, yeah, maybe they'll get some pleasure out of playing a video game for a little while, but they're going to need something else a little bit later.
5848706	5849166	It's just...
5850306	5853850	A bump on, you know, a ripple in the ocean, if that makes sense.
5854751	5859436	It's a little pebble in the pond on the way to the big boulder falling in and damming the whole thing.
5860437	5861038	Does that make sense?
5862039	5866924	It does, but I'm just, this whole thing is just, it just irritates me.
5868352	5869973	I'm just sick of the blame game.
5870794	5872594	That's a big problem with society.
5873595	5882759	People need to freaking grow up and also have the maturity to put the blame on who it needs to be put on, which is the person who did it.
5882879	5885620	It doesn't matter what else they're into.
5886200	5890602	They could be into latex fetish porn.
5890642	5893383	He could have been a concert-trained piano player.
5894404	5896885	Okay, the guy in Japan who was the cannibal?
5898078	5898599	Oh, God.
5898619	5900040	But I'm using him as an example.
5900661	5904285	He was a cultured, respected person.
5904565	5911152	He was smart, lived a very good life, but he ate some chick that he went out on dinner with.
5911332	5913214	He just gave in to the temptation of flesh.
5913755	5916358	Which, by the way, now he's actually a paid lecturer, just letting you know.
5917639	5919521	And I hear he's eating up all the attention.
5921542	5923284	But my point is... Fired!
5923725	5924005	Okay.
5924765	5926907	Alright, here's another example.
5927068	5928589	And I'm not just saying this because I'm Jewish.
5929150	5929450	Hitler.
5930491	5930991	Oh, God.
5931372	5932072	Failed painter.
5933894	5937858	He failed his entrance into a prestigious art school.
5938678	5939579	So he joined the military.
5941161	5942061	He was a vegetarian!
5943174	5948238	You would not assume vegetarian and painter would lead to mass murderer.
5949418	5949959	But it did.
5950679	5955643	Are you going to blame all vegetarians and painters now for being potential mass murdering fuckheads?
5956043	5957244	Well, vegetarians maybe.
5957324	5958445	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5958465	5960707	I don't know, vegetarians and pita maybe.
5960727	5962268	Well, pita is just psycho anyway.
5962948	5965390	I don't know, Jamie, you really murdered that onion in your salad.
5966671	5968192	But my point is, you know...
5971883	5973744	It doesn't matter what their hobbies are.
5973844	5975984	It doesn't matter the walk of life they come from.
5976444	5977825	Crazy is fucking crazy.
5977885	5978965	And you blame the person.
5979385	5983766	You don't see anybody blaming vegetarians for, you know, 100,000 people being killed.
5983807	5984747	You see them blaming Hitler.
5986187	5992109	Legend of Zaku in our chatroom says, Jamie, you have to accept that playing the blame game ever since the Salem witch trials.
5993067	5994088	And you see what happened then.
5994509	5995930	A bunch of innocent people died.
5996311	5997452	You'd think we'd learn from history.
5998033	5999514	No, because people are stupid.
5999554	6000916	There may have been some witches in there.
6001036	6001797	We don't know.
6004800	6005581	Alright, enough.
6006182	6006462	Enough.
6007063	6009345	On that note, Loki has effectively killed the conversation.
6009746	6011247	So let's change things up a bit.
6011788	6013330	I need some happy, goddammit.
6014355	6014855	Oh, much better.
6016857	6022641	Every week here on the show, DarkSakura takes a trip down memory lane and visits a classic video game that she says, Hey!
6023501	6024782	You need to be playing this game.
6025062	6025403	One thing.
6026003	6026183	What?
6026323	6027864	I do have to repeat what William Murderface said.
6028064	6028505	Alright.
6029085	6031107	The fallacy of correlation equals causation.
6033168	6034609	Now, can we do the classic game of the week?
6035349	6035470	Yes.
6035490	6036730	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
6037291	6037911	StarTropics.
6040013	6041774	At least you picked a really good classic game of the week.
6042586	6044769	You know, I actually didn't really play that game all that much.
6045009	6045329	Really?
6045610	6052358	Yeah, but it's been such a cool... But I remember playing it and enjoying it when I did... I just never... I just got lazy.
6052838	6055782	But it's... My best friend in fourth grade and I stayed up all night playing this game.
6055802	6057183	But it's a lot of people's favorite games.
6057263	6060027	So it's like, why shouldn't I bring up Star Topics, right?
6060307	6060487	Right.
6061528	6063610	So it was an action-adventure RPG.
6063670	6070454	It came out by Nintendo in 1990 for the NES, and it was never released or intended to be released in Japan.
6070494	6072576	It only came out in North America and Europe.
6072996	6082902	But it was designed by Japanese designers who lived in the U.S., written and directed by Genyo Takeda of Nintendo Integrated Research and Development, who also gave us Punch-Out!!
6083723	6090287	And it came out on the North American Virtual Console on January 7, 2008, and on the PAL region on January 11.
6091588	6095390	and, of course, I had a sequel, which was Zoda's Revenge, StarTropics 2, in 1994.
6096030	6098411	That was the year I'm not telling people what I did.
6099152	6101413	So you start off as, I graduated high school.
6102173	6102393	Okay.
6102953	6108416	Mike Jones is visiting his uncle, who is named Dr. J, and he lives on Sea Island.
6109176	6116160	And he finds that Dr. J has gone missing, and Babu, his assistant, who also sounds a lot like Baloo from The Jungle Book,
6117981	6124323	Let's Mike use the submarine to basically go look for Dr. J. So it starts off all of his adventures.
6124704	6126424	He thinks aliens are involved.
6127345	6133768	And basically he finds Dr. J by the wreckage of an alien escape pod.
6134548	6138410	So they think it's the Argonians.
6138790	6140871	So he has to go to the mothership and do open stuff.
6141391	6142352	and then Zoda comes.
6143553	6146875	And I'm not going to say anymore because there's more stuff to the game than just what I'm saying.
6147676	6149397	And there's also children adoption involved too.
6150718	6151619	I just thought I'd mention that.
6151699	6153000	But you don't adopt the children.
6153480	6153640	No.
6153760	6154501	You don't adopt children.
6155502	6159865	So basically it's a 2D top-down perspective kind of like Zelda in the dungeon areas.
6161626	6170553	But it is linear, consistent storyline and the story progresses basically with talking to NPCs and doing certain actions.
6171193	6174917	and then you have to go to your little dungeon-y areas.
6175057	6182143	So it switches mechanics there where it has a zoomed in type of perspective.
6184566	6195796	So basically you get weapons and items, baseball themed in many cases, and you basically, well you also get baseballs but they're called wonder horse hides.
6196997	6204764	and Clates known as Spikes and Bolas and Shuriken and Slingshots and Mirrors and different types of stuff.
6205104	6211209	But basically you get all kinds of things to help you progress through the game and fight all of the various baddies.
6213531	6221198	So you get a life meter of 22 hearts, kind of like Link, in fact it looks a lot like the Legend of Zelda life bar.
6222445	6235630	and you can find big hearts that are, again, like the heart containers in Zelda and you can get vitamin X that fills up all of your hearts even though, um, you know, you will lose, of course, health when you take damage.
6236450	6251496	So, uh, you can also get try your luck signs that, um, are, you know, basically can give you extra lives in the game you only start off with three and if you lose all of your lives at the beginning of a dungeon I mean, in a dungeon then you'll have to go back to the beginning
6252496	6256939	Um, so basically you've got, you know, your boss characters, it's RPG stuff.
6258160	6266446	So, it, you know, like I said, I didn't get to play a whole bunch of it, but I know a lot of people liked it.
6268328	6270089	We gotta talk about the letter that came with the game.
6270129	6271730	Yes, yes, there was a letter.
6272451	6277494	My friend and I, we had no idea that this was, oh my god, it was the coolest fucking thing when you were like nine or ten.
6278535	6280416	You get a parchment letter.
6281717	6285219	and... It actually came with the box.
6286580	6288320	She's not talking about something you get in the game.
6288340	6290141	It was a tangible thing that came in the box.
6290161	6291342	Made of parchment.
6292543	6296024	And basically it has a letter from Dr. Jones addressed to Mike.
6296685	6305209	And by the way, I actually did have a copy of the letter because when I rented StarTropics back in the day, they included the letter with the rental.
6309697	6317720	But basically, it's like you intercepted the letter and were being invited to play the game on Mike's behalf.
6318640	6325522	And then you get a message from your uncle, Evil Aliens from a distant planet, tell Mike to dip my letter in water.
6326142	6336365	So if you have the letter, the original letter, then you could put... What was that thing with the water?
6336525	6337385	They have a secret message?
6338100	6340142	Yeah, the letter, the visible ink or whatever.
6340262	6341383	It had a subcode in it.
6341763	6344386	Yeah, and I think it was supposed to be able to do it without damaging the letter.
6345006	6346548	Yeah, oh yeah, you could do it without damaging the letter.
6346688	6349590	Yeah, but you had a secret message in there.
6349690	6355576	I think it had like, if I remember right, there was a spot, a very specific spot where you would drip the water.
6356216	6356777	I can't.
6357057	6357677	I totally recall.
6358117	6360238	Actually, I'm going to see if I can find a picture of the letter.
6360378	6361158	I remember the code was 747.
6361198	6362999	Yes, it's actually on here.
6363739	6366460	And they actually... Like an airplane.
6366540	6375342	Nintendo Power was asked the question enough because people that rented the game or sometimes their letter would be damaged or missing in the package.
6376182	6378763	So Nintendo Power actually printed it after a while.
6379483	6382004	Yeah, I had to call into the hotline because I bought it used.
6382901	6386543	Yeah, it's kind of one of those things that like in retrospect, it probably wasn't a very good idea.
6387144	6390085	Like Ubisoft, don't pay attention to the letter thing.
6391767	6396429	Can you imagine that coming back as rights, copyright protection?
6396690	6408417	Remember back in the day on the, sorry, Jamie, but on the PC games, like the old school PC games, we'd have to like thumb to page 26 of the manual and read the symbol that's on there or get the plastic card that came with the game and
6408797	6411079	Oh my god, all this insane copy protection back in the day.
6411119	6412440	That's kind of what this sounds like.
6412460	6412800	The wheels.
6413901	6414761	But this one was cool.
6415682	6421466	Well, now, for Virtual Console, the letter is included in the digital manual.
6422166	6425529	And it has an image of the letter and a bucket of water at the bottom.
6426049	6430032	So you click on the image and the letter dips into the bucket and the code shows up.
6430973	6435556	On the European release, though, it just has a click here link at the bottom and the thing will pop up.
6436801	6439322	I think it's kind of neat that, you know, you dunk the virtual letter.
6439382	6440262	It's cute, it's cute, yeah.
6440823	6441943	I'm gonna see if I can find a copy of it.
6441983	6442723	I'll link it in the chat room.
6443024	6443324	But yeah.
6444284	6446485	I'm surprised they haven't remade that series yet.
6448406	6449646	I'm kind of surprised, too.
6449926	6451967	Like, they did have a sequel to StarTropics, I know.
6452047	6453268	Like, it was like... Zoda's Revenge.
6453288	6455929	Wasn't Zoda's Revenge, like, the last NES game they made?
6456009	6457069	Or no, that was Wario's Woods.
6457089	6457309	One of them.
6457689	6459090	It was right at the end, though.
6459110	6465673	I think Wario's Woods was technically the last NES game they ever made, but Zoda's Revenge was right at the end.
6465713	6466393	Alright, we've got the letter.
6467651	6467951	Nice.
6468672	6469552	Oh, that's a bad image.
6471673	6472033	There we go.
6473294	6476715	And I am going to put a link to that in the chat room.
6476775	6477856	Yeah, it would be fun.
6478456	6485519	If anyone wants to see, it's actually, and I love the name of the website, SocksMakePeopleSexy.net Why don't you just put it on Tumblr?
6485539	6486280	Put it on the Tumblr.
6486380	6488120	Okay, but I'm just going to say it to you.
6488140	6488321	Okay.
6488341	6489061	SocksMakePeopleSexy.net
6492382	6492863	Go check it out.
6494083	6496165	This guy looks like a Rob the Robot, by the way.
6496205	6500348	This Navcom guy in the little ship that you navigate.
6500428	6500948	Just so you know.
6501088	6502349	Looks just like a Rob the Robot.
6503470	6503990	Alright, anyhow.
6504030	6504271	There it is.
6504311	6505151	Your classic game of the week.
6505191	6506212	StarTropics.
6506692	6507993	One of my favorites, too.
6508073	6509574	Good call, DarkSakura.
6509734	6511916	Even though that wasn't one that maybe you remember as fondly.
6512903	6514365	That was a classic game for the rest of us.
6514385	6520930	There are a few games I haven't played or haven't played a whole lot of, but that doesn't mean that other people haven't played them.
6521511	6522251	There you go.
6523172	6539726	All right, we're going to take a quick break, guys, but when we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come, including some rapid-fire news, the FUs of the Week, the Mailbag, of course, your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR, and, of course, more phone calls when we get back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6545615	6548178	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6548218	6554565	We are live, of course, with our 422nd episode on this July 31st of 2011.
6554945	6557749	All right, we're into Part B of the show.
6557769	6561473	We're going to start off Part B, as we always do, with some rapid-fire news.
6561533	6563415	So, Loki, start us off with some rapid-fire news.
6563700	6567063	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6581717	6594262	To celebrate this, Harmonix is actually hooking up 30 people in America with 100 songs of their choosing, either on Xbox or PS3.
6595383	6597524	Of course, that's 3,000 songs.
6597844	6604467	There's different ways to enter via Twitter, Facebook, or the Rock Band forums.
6606167	6609749	Hopefully, someone out there is going to enjoy those 100 songs if you win.
6610470	6616178	Um, of course, as of us recording this, it ended about a few days ago.
6616418	6618602	So, uh, so much for that.
6618762	6620985	So if you didn't enter, then it's news you lose.
6621205	6622067	I forgot to enter too.
6623084	6628887	Of course, if you don't win the 100 songs, there are some other things coming out this week.
6629348	6633050	Including, and these are all individual songs, they don't have any packs this week.
6633750	6635511	Make Some Noise by the Beastie Boys.
6635791	6636231	That's going to be $2.
6637392	6639673	No Sleep to Brooklyn, also $2.
6640233	6641534	And that's also from the Beastie Boys.
6643215	6644516	Barracuda by Heart.
6645796	6645977	That's $2.
6646017	6647017	Awesome.
6647237	6647978	That's pretty awesome.
6648778	6651679	Superbad Parts 1 and 2 by James Brown.
6652079	6652740	That's also $2.
6654000	6657682	And Tell Me Something Good by Rufus featuring Shaka Khan.
6658222	6658722	That's also $2.
6659863	6666746	And you can get some pro bass and pro guitar expansions for Barracuda and Superbad Parts 1 and 2.
6668166	6669227	Not time for that yet, sorry.
6672132	6684097	Yes, it's funny because Duke Nukem still thinks it's popular, but Duke Nukem Forever is going to be getting some new download content, new multiplayer modes and maps this fall.
6684957	6698663	They're going to have a Hail to the Icons parody pack and it's going to have several parodies of different games, including they've got a parody of...
6700464	6703586	Team Fortress 2, that's going to be in there.
6704407	6707690	Two Forts, One Bridge, that's going to include hats.
6709351	6712393	And, you know, it says, Duke doesn't need no stinking hats.
6712473	6715696	Give him a minigun and he'll beat off all corners.
6721618	6728785	Inferno, Time Machine, Engage, Duke does combat in a hellish landscape of lava and teleporters.
6728905	6731247	Who turned on the 16-bit graphics?
6731628	6734491	More importantly, where did this DFG come from?
6735311	6739994	Ha ha ha, you're parodying Doom, a game that's how old?
6740334	6744516	Oh, as old as your last game, because that's how long it took to get it out.
6744616	6745316	Ha ha ha.
6746537	6752860	Sandpit, player's take role of mini-Duke in a giant sandbox with two bases on either end made of child's toys.
6753301	6756222	This map features sticky grenades and Call of Duke.
6756562	6758904	Gee, I wonder what game that is parodying.
6759964	6768276	Duke engages in modern combat in a war-torn city foes don't stand a chance against Duke when he spams him back with the noob tube
6769901	6780546	Okay, and they're also going to have freeze tag, which I guess is going to be, players will be able to freeze and shatter their opponents in huge succession for points and combos.
6780566	6781426	That's going to be the new mode.
6781446	6784808	You know what the funny part about it, about all this?
6785168	6788309	All those games that you're parodying, way better than your own game.
6788429	6790650	Ha ha ha, joke's on you, dumbass.
6792151	6795374	So that'll be coming if you bought Duke Nukem.
6795734	6796255	Hey, you know what?
6796295	6806404	By the time all this download content comes out, I bet you the download content will be priced higher than the actual game because it already got price dropped, by the way.
6806884	6808366	Did it really?
6808386	6809146	$3,999 happened this week.
6809266	6809547	Wow.
6810007	6810428	Yeah.
6811268	6812109	That's a good sign.
6812149	6815052	You know, when you drop something really quick, that means it's selling well, right?
6815492	6815712	Right?
6816353	6816493	No?
6818232	6828422	Um, and yeah, uh, Operation, uh, Rainfall, uh, apparently still not working out too well.
6829483	6833106	Um, Xenoblade Chronicles is not coming out over here.
6833907	6839953	Um, of course, you know, this week, Nintendo released their upcoming software list, and Xenoblade Chronicles, mm,
6840573	6841734	No way near to be found.
6842055	6845098	It is still scheduled for release in Europe, however, on August 19th.
6845678	6852004	And of course, you know, the game has been subject of ongoing campaigns by disgruntled American RPG fans.
6853005	6856349	And they're kind of pissed off that it's still not coming out over here.
6856389	6860052	Seeing as it's being localized into languages that, you know, us Americans speak.
6860172	6863075	So you'd think it'd be easy to publish it.
6863756	6864877	But Nintendo doesn't care.
6865157	6867000	Why don't they just put it on their downloadable service?
6868001	6868742	Oh, that's right.
6868782	6870264	They don't really have anything like that.
6871486	6874029	I mean, they have the Wii store, but... I don't know if you saw it.
6874090	6875451	They announced this week that, guess what?
6875471	6878476	They're going to now start offering download content on the 3DS.
6878836	6879717	I heard about that, yeah.
6879858	6880458	That's like...
6881079	6883581	Wow, way late to the party.
6883721	6885643	Well, I mean, didn't the Wii do that too?
6885763	6894330	I mean, the Wii had Rock Band, and you could download some stuff on there, so I don't think it's exactly earth-shattering to hear that Nintendo's supporting DLC.
6894450	6895611	It's really just a matter of when.
6895671	6896972	But it's just not coming out yet.
6897072	6899895	I mean, it's like they haven't built the infrastructure into the 3DS.
6899915	6901756	There's no games worth it yet.
6902837	6908360	Wait, now what would be interesting is Nintendo saying, we are getting on board with that.
6908621	6910102	That would truly be something new.
6910122	6912003	That would be like Bizarro World.
6912123	6913404	Now that is something.
6913424	6915465	Mario Kart with new downloadable tracks.
6915505	6916085	Exactly.
6916405	6917966	That is the story to wait for.
6918046	6919527	Is that what Nintendo's talking about?
6919547	6920528	Because then that's news.
6922634	6924895	Anyhow, moving on to some other news.
6925495	6929657	Street Fighter X Tekken is obviously on everybody's radar, especially if you're into fighting games.
6930017	6935279	But fans of the characters Dan, that might be DarkSakura, she's a fan of Dan.
6935919	6939421	If you're a fan of Dan or a fan of Anna from Tekken, you might be disappointed.
6940101	6943002	Both of them have been announced as not in the roster.
6943062	6945223	In fact, they were booted out of the game.
6946164	6957054	The series producer Yoshinori Ono has said that those characters won't be in Street Fighter X Tekken because he was killed by a Tekken character at Comic Con last year.
6957434	6962219	But I think the real reason is, quote, as much as I personally wanted to have... Oh, I'm sorry, this is about Anna and Nina.
6962999	6969926	As much as I personally wanted to have a cool Nina and Anna tag battle, the director was against putting Anna because we already had Nina in.
6970847	6973590	Now, of course, Dan probably isn't gone for real real.
6974070	6979035	I would, at this point, knowing Capcom, wait for Street Fighter X Tekken Super or whatever.
6979156	6982519	Honestly, I think Anna's going to be a palette swap for Nina.
6983109	6985251	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7010349	7012650	Some soundtrack related news, quite a bit of it actually.
7012891	7016212	There's a Raiden music collection that's due out on September 28th.
7016613	7023276	It's Team Entertainment is the record label, a four-disc compilation of music from the Raiden series called The Lightning Strikes Back.
7023697	7030741	It will have music from Raiden the Arcade from the 90s, Raiden 2, Raiden DX, Raiden DX PlayStation, Raiden 3, and Raiden 4.
7031601	7034424	for coming out September 28th in Japan.
7035025	7037868	Also in soundtrack news, The King of Fighters 13.
7039530	7045697	The pre-orders will come with 15 years of musical history, a four CD soundtrack compilation.
7045717	7047359	That's what Atlas is putting out there.
7047699	7049841	Try and get folks to pre-order The King of Fighters 13.
7049921	7051924	That's pretty cool, actually.
7053524	7056966	There's also supposed to be some exclusive game modes in the console version of the game.
7057286	7066169	A story mode that will have new visuals and animations, a practice mode, a tutorial mode, and other stuff that wasn't in the arcade but you would expect to see in a console release of a fighter.
7066649	7072491	One other soundtrack news, Rhythm Heaven on the Wii is getting a four-disc soundtrack.
7073592	7078553	It's already out in Japan, Rhythm Heaven Wii, but it's coming out here as well.
7078974	7079714	So there you go.
7081395	7086139	A 4-disc CD soundtrack coming out in Japan August 24th for 4,800 yen.
7086679	7088360	150 songs.
7089221	7091022	Perfect and extended tracks included.
7091883	7097147	Lastly on the plate tonight, not in soundtrack news, but in sequel rumor news, TimeSplitters 4.
7097447	7099789	Rumored that there is a version of that coming.
7100169	7104470	I guess this is because of the official PlayStation Magazine UK's rumor machine section.
7104750	7108691	There's a rumor that says, quote, Gun-wielding monkeys are finally making a comeback.
7108991	7111691	A fourth TimeSplitters title is to be announced soon.
7112171	7117012	Of course, it is coming from the rumors, but when you consider it's the official PlayStation Magazine.
7117112	7118212	I love me some TimeSplitters.
7118272	7121233	I know, I bet you're excited about that, so we will see.
7122913	7124373	Not until they actually announce something.
7125474	7128114	Because they've been talking to TimeSplitters for a long time now.
7129683	7130809	Alright, let's go to DarkSakura.
7132503	7134663	In other news, we have the Endermen.
7134763	7135864	They're coming for you.
7136484	7137544	They're actually a new Minecraft mob.
7138204	7143305	And they're just little black stick figures with... Like everything in Minecraft.
7144845	7145445	But they're all black.
7146085	7157468	They actually remind me of... Do you ever remember in Mario Galaxy where there were the little black guys that were standing on top of the world but you couldn't get to them and they would just watch you?
7158128	7159148	That's what they look like to me.
7159688	7159968	Gotcha.
7161089	7188791	and they're just there to be scary like they're there to terrify you so that's all they're there for and they're going to be in the next Minecraft update it's based off of I guess a character that was made on the something awful forums Slenderman which I watched they have this ARG it's called like Marvel something I forget what it's called and really creepy really really creepy
7190003	7194566	The Slender Man's also been thrown in a number of other video games too, just in background stuff.
7196087	7197248	Very creepy.
7197268	7206953	They'll basically stand still moving blocks around stuff, but if you move your reticle over them, they'll stare at you and then they'll charge at you.
7208054	7210035	And they can teleport and kill you.
7212957	7216219	I'm actually going to link a picture in the chat room so they can see what it looks like.
7217600	7217980	There you go.
7218642	7222705	So, moving forward, we also have something from Disney.
7223106	7228670	They want to buy UTV Ignition for $454 million.
7232153	7240879	This actually news comes from Develop, and it says that Disney already owns 50.4% of UTV, and they're wanting to acquire the whole thing for its Bollywood films and TV shows.
7241980	7242980	So, who knows?
7243100	7245781	But they own Ignition, so that means there might be some issues.
7246901	7253983	And last but never least, and related to Disney a bit, Toy Story download content is coming for LittleBigPlanet 2.
7254583	7259604	There will be, and actually it's going to be on August 3rd in the UK.
7259664	7260604	That's going to be £4.79 or €5.99.
7265465	7272231	And that's nine Toy Story themed levels with two cut scenes, five levels and two mini levels.
7273272	7280598	Two new music tracks, one new interactive music track, one new level background, five materials, ten decorations, six objects, and 149 stickers.
7282219	7282799	That's pretty rad.
7282839	7290361	And then the costume pack, which is going to cost the same, has Buzz Lightyear gloves, helmet, legs, teeth, and body.
7290421	7297243	Then there's Slinky Dog set that has the feet, ears, hands, nose, skin, body, and tail.
7297723	7300344	There's Ham, which is a head, skin, and body.
7301024	7304005	And Rex, which is the claws, head, skin, and body.

7333199	7337321	First off, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, do check out another show that we produce here.
7337601	7341063	It's called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth at www.hordehouse.com.
7341323	7342883	It's myself and my buddy, Extifer.
7343324	7349586	And this week we had special guest, Ferare, one of the guild leaders for Extifer's guild on Talking Smack About WoW.
7350026	7352087	Some really good Firelands and raiding discussion this week.
7352147	7355149	So if you're a fan of WoW, check that out again, hordehouse.com.
7355229	7355669	One more day.
7356209	7356929	What's one more day?
7357289	7359070	Oh, you get your last Firelands vendor, right?
7359090	7359250	I know.
7359270	7360351	You know you get a new mount from that.
7360631	7361111	I know!
7361191	7362652	You get like a little firebird thing.
7362672	7362992	I know!
7363092	7364452	Salacious Pop got that the other day.
7364472	7365613	I know, I know, I know, I know.
7365833	7367533	You'll be getting to ride a flaming bird.
7368414	7368834	I know.
7369094	7369374	All right.
7370374	7381679	Also, the third podcast is probably delayed a little bit considering there's some personal stuff going on and so forth, but we are still eyeing that at least by Labor Day, no later than that.
7382499	7384700	We've already got things definitely in motion.
7384820	7384980	Yeah.
7385160	7386961	So, more hints coming.
7387121	7389721	Some of you have been begging me on Twitter for more information about that.
7389801	7397663	So, all I will say is that, you know, certain components of this show, if you like it, you're going to really like the new show.
7398544	7401024	Otherwise, oh well, you still got this show.
7401424	7402545	And it's all free, so don't complain.
7402925	7406306	And they might learn a thing or two.
7406626	7407366	That's right, you might.
7408714	7410554	Also, I want to say this.
7411135	7413935	A new segment coming to OLR, actually.
7413955	7416155	You know how we have some segments we like to do on the show?
7416695	7418656	Obviously, a lot of things you're very used to.
7418756	7423157	The Twitter topics, the Skype line we do at the end of the show, Classic Game of the Week and so forth.
7423937	7425297	We've kind of talked amongst ourselves.
7425697	7428418	We like to mix it up once in a while at OLR.
7428478	7432398	While we have a formula that works for us, once in a while we want to mix it up.
7432558	7436739	One thing we want to feature more on the program is indie games.
7437279	7439501	So we're going to have a new segment starting soon.
7439561	7440621	I can't say exactly when.
7440641	7442463	It just depends when I can get some folks on the show.
7442803	7444604	But we're actually going to spotlight indie games.
7444984	7456893	We don't have a name for the segment yet, but we are going to have – or I guess I should say invite developers onto the show to talk about their passion, their game, and share our space with the indie developers.
7456973	7460355	We've had some on in the past in more full interview capacity.
7460655	7461676	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7488789	7489129	DarkSakura.com
7510623	7540329	so if you are a developer that wants to have your indie game featured on the show I would like to keep it to relatively new releases but in the beginning I won't be too picky but something that's been out in the past few months or so do drop me an email you can email me personally rob at orange lounge radio dot com or you can always drop the general email bag as well mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com we'll get you in touch with who you need to get in touch with so that is coming to the show soon whenever we get enough stuff in the pipeline where we have some things to feature we're going to spotlight that here in the show
7540549	7541089	I'm excited.
7541469	7545790	Just think about it like the classic game of the week, but now it's going to be the indie game of the week.
7545810	7546511	The new classics.
7546771	7548491	I guess you could think about it that way.
7548591	7551132	And it won't just be DarkSakura telling you about it.
7551152	7553192	We want to have a discussion with the developer.
7553833	7558734	Although if a week goes by where maybe we're having a hard time getting somebody, we'll talk about something that caught our eye.
7559654	7561336	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7580976	7589060	but it's so adorable and all the characters are little 8-bit characters and they look so cute and they have their little bit books that they update and you know what I really love?
7589440	7590620	There's one called Tiny Zoo.
7590941	7592261	You know what I love about Tiny Tower?
7592781	7594042	Let me tell you this about Tiny Tower.
7595062	7606768	What I love about it is that yes, it's free to play and they have these whole tower bucks things and if you want to buy the tower bucks you can do that and move the game a lot faster but
7607268	7622740	but you don't have to because once in a while and more so than in most free-to-play games you'll get tipped a tower buck or you'll get tower bucks as little incentive rewards and so it helps to move the game along a little bit and what I also love about it is that if you forget to check your tower for three weeks
7623360	7626202	Oh well, the lights were dark for three weeks and you didn't make any money.
7626582	7628062	Your citizens don't move out.
7628483	7630444	They don't burn the building down in protest.
7630904	7634606	It's just, you know, it doesn't require your tender, loving care all the time.
7634906	7636427	So if you want to play it every day, you can.
7636667	7637767	If you want to play it once a week, you can.
7638127	7642570	That is good design, in my opinion, and where the freemium model should go.
7643290	7645871	And I do know people that have spent money on Tiny Tower.
7646332	7649633	I wouldn't, but I think if people want to, they can.
7650113	7650554	So there you go.
7651514	7658980	Alright, so I'm looking at our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and it does look like some folks in chat are excited about the whole indie games.
7660522	7661843	Talking about that segment coming up.
7662063	7664365	And Actdeft there says, Woo!
7664485	7665626	New OLR segment.
7666927	7671030	Breakman in chat says, How will any of you ever have the time to actually play games?
7671350	7672912	Talking about the third podcast.
7673232	7673913	I will say this much.
7673933	7674573	Hey, I'm not working.
7674593	7675194	Yeah.
7676615	7676995	I am.
7677755	7679536	Adding a third podcast to the plate is going to be something.
7679937	7687742	It's not going to be a long show and it's going to be something where we can record several of them in a day and produce it regularly.
7687802	7688442	I'm not going to lie.
7688462	7689503	That's the way it's going to be done.
7690043	7691684	But I think you guys will get a kick out of it.
7691924	7694746	It is going to be myself, DarkSakura, and Dan.
7695171	7699353	Loki is, of course, always welcome whenever he wants to come on, but he's got other stuff he's got to do, too.
7699753	7703514	And Dan, of course, is going to add a whole new element, especially when we tell you more about what it's about.
7704535	7706235	It'll be great.
7709376	7709777	Let's see.
7711337	7711677	Let's see.
7711777	7714078	Breakman in the chat says, Xbox Live Indie Games.
7714158	7715899	Those devs need to call OLR.
7716279	7716719	I agree.
7717599	7718880	So please, again, get in touch with me.
7718920	7720100	Rob at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
7720140	7720881	Who wants to be first?
7723082	7741153	and let's see Misty about Tiny Tower in chat says hey protest burning might be funny once anyway at least I do agree it would be nice to see them do like a little more with some of the events and so forth but the game is still early in its life and I'm sure there'll be update patches and so forth now that's iOS gaming done well I'm gonna tell you what iOS game blows
7741957	7742998	Absolutely blows.
7743518	7744878	Capcom Arcade.
7745339	7746059	You check this out?
7746419	7758545	Capcom Arcade, you can play classic Capcom Arcade games like 1942 and, I don't know, what else is in the... Ghosts and Goblins and Street Fighter and all that.
7758845	7759605	You can play those.
7760086	7762487	The deal is you can play like three games...
7763187	7764468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7786584	7787605	Thank you for watching!
7803477	7824948	and I was like the music kept going so I knew that the emulation was still running but the game itself just froze and I was like did anybody fucking test this or did they just decide to just put this shit out and see who'd buy it because it seemed to me like option B so yet another strike from Capcom this week that Capcom Arcade needs to be tested better it sucks
7826795	7828736	Anyhow, so there you go.
7828776	7830417	That's my iOS talk.
7830978	7832939	Let's get back into some other news.
7833279	7835941	So we'll do some long news with Loki.
7836755	7837755	Yes.
7839336	7850660	You know, and since we were talking a little bit about Capcom, and they made an errant judgment, if you will, back with Resident Evil Mercenaries, where they said, hey, you know what?
7851760	7854541	We're going to make it impossible for you to erase your game to save.
7854801	7860243	And everybody was pissed, and hopefully we figured that maybe people learned by that lesson.
7861503	7862423	Well, no.
7863324	7872127	Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions from Namco also features a problem where your save files are permanent and unable to be reset or erased.
7874608	7881090	Of course, they put this out, and according to Wired's Game Life blog,
7883339	7886702	There's simply no way to erase a save once it's been written to the cartridge.
7886722	7892647	I've looked all over, even going as far as to ask a Namco Bandai representative, and it doesn't seem like there's a way to erase a save game.
7893587	7906078	And, um, you know, basically saying that the design doesn't just affect earned in-game awards, which can't be deleted, but also high scores, meaning that the most recent high score is the only one that the game records.
7907319	7907399	Um...
7908820	7918188	Apparently, though, Namco, they have come to an explanation for it, and they're saying that... Here's how it works.
7921144	7922004	Pac-Man Tilt.
7922144	7926566	It says the plus high score from the EX Level 1.
7926826	7929847	It says it needs to open 10 medals.
7930447	7933568	I can't really see what the high scores are here.
7934288	7940190	Score ranking keeps one of each of the top scores mentioned above to submit to online ranking boards.
7940510	7944132	It keeps the gamer's name in which the player can input via on-screen keyboard.
7947017	7950038	Yeah, it doesn't really say why they did that.
7950058	7952419	It just shows how it's affected.
7953039	7961022	They said they confirmed that players have the option to share high scores online, but using the same cartridge in different DS main posts to score twice.
7962162	7962402	What?
7962842	7966824	Namco Bandai didn't comment on the decision-making process behind it.
7968344	7969945	Sounds like no decision was made.
7970005	7972986	It sounds like just bad design again.
7975259	7987137	Yeah, other than, you know, it says, but they were the copy, Capcom's response would say that it was an attempt to preserve the game's arcade-style feel and it would never do it again.
7989420	7990802	I'm, you know, here's my thing.
7991663	7999006	The 3DS, okay, you've got very little penetration for the 3DS out there right now.
7999646	8004667	Do you really need to hinder sales of any game on that system?
8004787	8010729	And, you know, Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions, I don't know about you, but that's not really at the top of my list of games.
8011089	8015571	Well, they're great on Xbox Live Arcade, and it sounds like that's where they're going to remain great.
8016501	8018983	Yeah, but it's just like, really?
8019603	8020624	You thought that was a good idea?
8020644	8031310	The thing that concerns me here, I mean, and I would say, I might have been interested in these games if the price was right, but again, this whole save file thing, I can't support this.
8031771	8035613	The excuse they're giving just fucking doesn't make sense.
8036253	8037814	They're really talking us in circles.
8037834	8039195	No, they didn't really have an excuse.
8039695	8040656	They gave no excuse.
8040876	8048672	This concerns me because we have two companies that have made the same mistake that's very fishy.
8050177	8052219	and that's the whole used game market, right?
8052639	8057444	So it's really fishy to me that we have two companies that have now done this.
8057744	8058785	You do understand people.
8058925	8060127	Is this a trend?
8060367	8062569	This isn't going to stop you.
8062709	8066112	I mean, yeah, it will stop used game sales.
8066252	8068755	You know how it's going to stop used game sales or at least hinder it?
8068975	8070116	Stop new game sales?
8070196	8072278	Exactly, because people aren't going to buy the new game.
8072558	8075181	Because if you're going to buy a game, which, you know,
8076684	8080607	GameStop may decide, hey, you know what, we're not going to take it back because you can't erase a save game.
8080867	8083430	Granted, they haven't made the decision permanently so far.
8083790	8087933	They did at one time with Resident Evil where they said, oh, we're not going to take it back, and then they changed that.
8088373	8100924	But, you know, if they do this, then, you know, a consumer that realizes, you know what, I'm going to play this game for a while, then I'm probably going to get sick of it, and I'm going to sell it and get some money for something else...
8101704	8104385	If they can't sell it back, they may not buy it.
8104865	8105365	You know what?
8105465	8107206	I'll just skip buying that.
8107386	8108946	I'll wait until another game comes out.
8110087	8112808	It's just... It's dumb.
8113148	8114188	It's really a dumb idea.
8114948	8122551	And why you should be limited... Why even at all games should be saved to the carts that they're on instead of your system?
8122751	8126512	Your 3DS, which has a goddamn SD card in it,
8126992	8155275	everyone comes with one not even something you have to buy separately like on most PSPs and you can save to that I don't understand why you can't do that that's stupid you know with the DS it made sense because there was no saving whatsoever to the system there was no storage of any sort whatsoever but this is the 3DS come on jump into the century where you know what we can store data to these cards
8157001	8161683	It's not like Namco could have heard what Capcom did and then made the decision.
8161803	8167005	Both of these companies made this conscious decision to design the saves this way months ago.
8167345	8168666	And that is weird to me.
8169486	8171347	It's almost like somebody put them up to it.
8172667	8175148	That's what strikes me as just really weird.
8175448	8177048	But anyway, I hope this trend stops.
8177728	8178989	And yet again, another game.
8179569	8185610	But this one, unlike the Capcom game, this was one I was legitimately like, oh, I really do love Pac-Man Championship Edition.
8185670	8189171	I wouldn't mind a portable version of it, you know, if it was like 1999 maybe.
8189591	8193952	But now, nope, not going to do it because I'm not going to support this type of game design.
8195824	8200126	Even though I do tend to buy most of my games new, and I don't sell a lot of them back.
8200186	8201466	Very rarely do I sell games back.
8201827	8204808	The last game I remember distinctly selling back was Top Spin 3.
8206649	8210950	And just a handful of GameCube and old first generation Xbox 360 games.
8213709	8218394	Anyhow, more news about the Xbox 360 anyway, since I brought it up there.
8218794	8224700	Free-to-play games apparently are inevitable on the Xbox 360, at least according to one publisher.
8225421	8229946	Todd Harris of Hi-Rez Studios, who makes the game Tribes Ascend.
8230026	8233970	It's a multiplayer first-person shooter coming to the PC and hopefully someday the 360.
8235671	8251178	Todd Harris says quote at least from our conversations both Sony and Microsoft are moving there strategically but there are still some things to be worked out on both the business side and the technical side of the certification side that's a tongue twister regarding frequency of patches
8251958	8257181	Those issues just need further advancement before we would be comfortable putting a release timeframe on the console version.
8257541	8262823	It's not the case of never, but we know all those things we can handle on the PC, so that's why PC is first.
8263344	8263744	Interesting.
8263824	8265384	I think I remember hearing something about this.
8265565	8269266	Doesn't Microsoft limit you to the number of patches you're able to do within the release?
8269546	8270007	I think so.
8270027	8271747	I think you have to pay for that or something.
8271807	8274609	Maybe that's why, because free-to-play games...
8276149	8277190	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8298703	8299464	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8316588	8317528	I know, that's the sad part.
8318669	8324150	Alright, and Breakman comments in our chatroom at chat.org.com Xbox has already had free-to-play games.
8324510	8325091	One versus 100.
8325751	8326671	Too bad it didn't last.
8326731	8327211	Good point.
8327791	8331993	One versus 100 wasn't an MMO per se, but it was a free-to-play game, sure.
8332153	8337894	It was Microsoft-backed, for one, but everybody, well, at least a lot of people I know miss it dearly.
8337954	8339455	It's not a freemium game, though.
8339475	8343116	But you know, though, that Marvel's MMO is going to be free-to-play.
8344296	8345157	That's right, I remember hearing that.
8345177	8345477	With Deadpool.
8345577	8346137	But it's not going to be on 360.
8346177	8346337	No.
8346437	8347978	It's going to be a PC game.
8347998	8348578	Yeah, but still.
8348878	8349098	Yeah.
8350599	8353680	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
8353780	8358562	Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read your emails.
8359103	8359743	Live here on air.
8361846	8363047	Actually, I gotta say this live.
8363087	8364167	This is really funny, just live.
8364467	8366208	We had a little net split live.
8366228	8368410	And if you've ever been in IRC, you know what a net split is.
8368950	8373472	And I guess Loki's on one side of the net split and I'm on another.
8373492	8376554	Because I could see that Loki just left the room.
8377014	8379956	It's me on an island with Black Wolf and Dark Tetsuya.
8380336	8381457	Oh, and everybody's back.
8381657	8382477	Oh, just reconnected.
8382517	8382857	There you go.
8384238	8384939	That's kind of funny.
8385520	8385841	All right.
8387063	8387805	Oh, internets.
8388085	8389828	You never cease to amaze me.
8389848	8390810	All right, let's move on.
8390990	8391371	Mailbag.
8391471	8395358	Oh, yeah, mailbag that thing.
8396240	8396881	Well, we got two.
8398001	8400002	I'm going to double check and see if we got any more real quick.
8400443	8401123	Nope, just two.
8401503	8402144	This is the first one.
8402464	8403105	Hey, guys.
8403425	8403725	Hey.
8404105	8406907	Just wondering, do you know of any smaller Xbox controllers?
8407327	8415333	The current ones are so big, and the way the buttons are situated, I can only play for about 10 minutes because I also have arthritis.
8415893	8421817	It's really irritating as I bought Dragon Age 2, but haven't been able to really progress because I can't really do the attacks.
8422177	8423898	And the ones I can do really bother my hands.
8424078	8427121	Thanks, Holly D. Well, they all come with a smaller...
8428281	8428862	Out of the bag, broken.
8450619	8454420	What about like, I mean, I know she might be thinking smaller, but what about thinking bigger?
8454981	8456141	Like what about an arcade stick?
8456481	8457602	That's what my suggestion was.
8457622	8460823	I have, I've had hand surgery twice on my right hand.
8461363	8466766	So it gets really stiff really easily and my fingers will lock up because I still need to have one of the finger worked on.
8467786	8476331	But, like, for example, I can play Dragon Age 2 just fine because I use my thumb and forefinger for a lot of stuff and neither of those are ones that have problems.
8476711	8482274	But I cannot play fighting games very well because I'm moving so fast and my hand will start cramping up.
8482814	8493880	So what I found is that using the joystick, you know, like we have the tournament stick and we've got the Xbox joystick, which you can probably find at a used game store somewhere for cheap.
8496462	8520554	I have no problem so something like that will work a situation like that is tough too because you really need to get your no pun intended you need to get your hands on a controller to actually try it before you buy it so I would really suggest you head out to something where they tend to have those things out for you to try like maybe Best Buy I know Fry's but they're more west coast Fry's always seems to have that kind of stuff out at least the arcade sticks but I know they don't have those everywhere
8521516	8522759	Hopefully there's a store near you.
8522819	8528856	Maybe even an independent store might be a way to go where they would have some of that stuff out for you to try it and see how your hand takes to that.
8529144	8541873	By the way, speaking of the controllers they have out at Fry's, they have a six-button PlayStation controller that's third-party but supported by Sony that's super comfortable.
8542714	8551920	So, I mean, maybe see how that likes and then see if the same distributor makes another pad like it because I found that to be really comfortable and it was just a six-button fighting stick.
8552440	8556964	I was playing Super Street Fighter 4 with it at Fry's.
8557764	8558124	Interesting.
8558164	8558264	Yeah.
8559145	8560185	So that was that email.
8560305	8561206	And then the last one.
8562146	8563926	Just two quick unrelated questions.
8565287	8573529	First off, is there an online multiplayer game that varies the audio of voice chat or availability of text chat based on proximity?
8574409	8579331	A character closer to you would sound louder, while players across the map couldn't be heard at all.
8579871	8583612	I haven't gotten my feet wet with it, but I suggest World of Warcraft would do something like this.
8583712	8584152	Actually, it does.
8584676	8585157	It does not.
8585217	8588601	And the voice chat that's built into WoW kind of has a reputation for sucking.
8589001	8594067	They tried to build it so that people wouldn't have to get what's called Ventrilo servers or TeamSpeak some people use.
8595068	8597330	But folks tend to rely on the Ventrilo servers.
8597631	8598472	With characters though?
8599453	8601175	Actually, your proximity does change with NPCs.
8604250	8607331	Yeah, but... If your sound drivers will support it.
8607471	8608671	Right, but not other people.
8608731	8610472	I think he's thinking like a person-to-person game.
8610712	8613473	You know what game comes to mind to me for some reason is Halo.
8613553	8614433	Didn't Halo do that?
8614453	8616774	Or specifically Halo 2 and Halo 3?
8616814	8617614	No, but he says a character.
8617634	8620255	He's not saying... Oh, he said a character.
8620335	8621575	Yeah, WoW does that.
8621855	8622656	Yeah, WoW does that.
8623676	8628877	Um... WoW will also pan left to right, depending on your sound card.
8629117	8629358	Yeah.
8630658	8630738	Um...
8632975	8646831	I know that area noises in Portal 2, and also the loudspeaker in Portal 2, based on where you are, the loudspeaker will project a different way depending on the texture of the walls and where you are.
8647352	8647912	Do you remember that?
8649174	8650455	So the echo will be different.
8653530	8657412	Yeah, and when you're talking to, I don't care, spoilers, it's been out already.
8657712	8664155	When you're talking to Potatoes through the glass wall, she's a little quieter than when you're actually right in front of her.
8665115	8672299	So, a lot more games are doing that, but really a lot of it also has to do with your sound card and playing stereo versus mono.
8673199	8674060	And then the second question.
8674220	8677041	Real quick, Tiger Call on our chatroom says, they still use Ventrilo?
8677181	8678902	Ventrilo harassment comes to mind.
8678922	8679982	Yeah, I've seen those YouTubes.
8680883	8681243	Interesting.
8681363	8688090	For the record, on Star Trek Online, which by the way also does the distance based, I use TeamSpeak.
8689012	8689732	I didn't do any of that.
8690253	8691034	It's just like Ventrilo.
8691505	8694546	Ventrilo for Ragnarok For the record, I do prefer Ventrilo versus TeamSpeak
8714096	8717039	What tense is used in phrases such as will have happened?
8717059	8717399	Future Perfect
8735319	8735920	We'll have happened.
8737001	8746991	When you're referring to anything that is a future event happening, but in that future point where it has already happened, it's future perfect.
8747351	8747652	Really?
8747772	8749193	I thought we were a video game show.
8749314	8749894	Hey, he asked.
8750375	8751135	I know this shit.
8751175	8751656	Fair enough.
8752076	8754559	And that's from Robert M. What?
8756124	8756966	add it for the emails then?
8757427	8767044	yeah if you want to get in on the email bag mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com but now's the part of the show where we could rant about lack of emails if we would like CFU's of the week
8781764	8790609	Um, you know, I did have one at the beginning of the show, and now for the life of me, I can't remember what it is, so... Fuck you to not remembering.
8792229	8793830	You know the memory's the first thing you go.
8794350	8794991	Hey, Rob?
8795611	8795851	What?
8799153	8799453	Loki?
8801374	8806476	Um... Fuck you to Whole Foods for being too damn expensive.
8807157	8808177	Go to Sunflower instead.
8808197	8809338	All the same stuff, and it's cheaper.
8809878	8812539	There's some big cheese wheels that I really wanted to buy.
8813239	8814520	They're probably like $300.
8815660	8816721	I like me my parm.
8819102	8820463	I don't really have a whole lot of FUs.
8820503	8822203	Things are pretty good otherwise.
8822864	8825105	FU to weekends not being three days long.
8825125	8826545	I'll do something a little silly like that.
8827986	8829006	That's it for the FUs of the week.
8830747	8831767	Let's get back into some news.
8832128	8832388	Loki.
8832708	8834388	Haha, I'm not able to say that FU.
8836775	8837836	I got a 3D weekend this weekend.
8838256	8846601	Anyways, let's talk about some more retarded DRM.
8847061	8849602	And I'm saying that because it's Ubisoft.
8849682	8857167	And Ubisoft learned their lesson with the always-on DRM that they had with Assassin's Creed and stuff.
8858067	8863393	But no, they're back with the always-on Assassin's Creed-type DRM for Driver San Francisco.
8864975	8868198	Yes, the PC version will require a permanent internet connection.
8871802	8875466	No word if that's going to be loosened or not, like it was with Assassin's Creed.
8876627	8879029	or I believe Prince of Persia was the other game that used that.
8880670	8886875	Of course, the console version has the stupid Uplay Passport now, the one-time use code that will unlock multiplayer access.
8887275	8888636	Thank you, Ubisoft.
8888777	8889877	I get to play some multiplayer.
8892594	8893534	How generous of you.
8893874	8896915	Also, FromDust is getting the Ubisoft DRM as well.
8897075	8898575	Thanks, Ubisoft.
8899395	8901996	And that kind of sucks.
8902996	8914759	Then, to kind of add a little bit of the icing on top of their stupid cake, they have come out and said that, guess what?
8915039	8917079	Our Always On DRM is a success!
8917599	8921120	It's a success in pissing everyone off!
8921300	8921861	Yay!
8922521	8929827	Basically, it says, Ubisoft has seen the clear reduction in piracy of our titles, which required a persistent online connection.
8930487	8934531	And from that point of view, the requirement is success.
8934751	8938233	That's because everyone went further underground to get around your DRM.
8938514	8941836	I mean, they really think that people aren't going to find a way around it again?
8941916	8942477	Here's the thing.
8942957	8947581	I don't know what exactly is considered success because...
8948141	8950504	Yes, less people are pirating your game.
8951084	8951845	But you know what?
8952726	8962095	The number of people pirating your game before versus the number of people pirating your game now that you say it's reduced, does that actually equal out to more sales?
8962595	8965798	Because those two numbers are independent of each other.
8966199	8967340	They have nothing to do with it.
8967660	8971023	You know, whether people are interested in downloading your game or not, you know...
8973006	8978432	Someone may not have been interested in downloading Assassin's Creed 2 on PC or Splinter Cell Conviction on PC.
8979253	8981496	Maybe they just didn't want to pirate the game.
8982237	8984219	You ever think of that?
8985641	8989686	And not to mention, though, that the previous games, you know...
8991169	8994131	The DRM was hacked within a few weeks anyways.
8994731	9003756	So I wouldn't exactly go out and shout at the top of your lungs that it's a great success.
9004096	9010499	Because all you're really doing is affecting the people that legitimately buy the game and now they want to play it offline or something like that.
9010839	9014281	Say you take your laptop with you and you want to play it at...
9015982	9033985	A friend's house or something and you don't have open wifi Or say you're a serviceman overseas serving our country and you want to play a game to relax on your break Can't do it Thanks Ubisoft So Yeah, it's stupid How is that a success?
9034045	9043927	That's offensive The only people that this hurts is the people who bought the game legitimately That's who this hurts Pirates will still get their game and you're an idiot if you don't think they won't
9045839	9046540	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9066540	9069641	So, who's going to win in that?
9070522	9073783	The pirates, because they don't have your crappy DRM anymore.
9073943	9074423	What's this about?
9074443	9075864	They denied the rumored cracks?
9076084	9078345	Oh, this was back in March.
9079645	9085068	They had, of course, their new DRM, and I want to say it was for... I'm trying to remember which game it was.
9085108	9090730	It wasn't... Maybe it was Assassin's Creed 2, but there was another game that they had coming out as well.
9092010	9092971	I guess they...
9095327	9103250	Pirated copies of various PC games from Ubisoft are apparently making the rounds online, sparking allegations that the DRM has already been defeated.
9103470	9116356	Ubisoft spokesman reported to Edge stating, "...this rumor is false, and while the pirated version may seem to be complete at startup, any gamer who downloads and plays the cracked version will find that the version is not complete."
9117396	9124087	Yeah, not completing the fact that you don't get, I don't know what it was that they didn't get access to, but it was something really stupid.
9124287	9127792	Like, oh, you don't get access to our wonderful customer service.
9127812	9129295	You don't get the Uplay features.
9130717	9131137	Hooray.
9132281	9132761	Thank you for watching!
9150325	9150725	Woosh!
9151126	9153447	You've just thrown gasoline on the fire, you dumbass!
9155008	9155368	Alright.
9155928	9162192	Well, speaking of adding fuel to the fire, there's obviously a lot of pissed off people that Mega Man Legends 3 got cancelled.
9162653	9163673	What does the internet love?
9163793	9164954	Petitions!
9165534	9170978	So, an activist group has called themselves 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3.
9172318	9199726	they're trying to get 100,000 members and they are trying to get them all on their Facebook page so you can go over there and like them if you are so inclined not exactly they are doing that but there's an actual official petition which you have to do is sign up for the dev room stuff for the Mega Man Legends 3 project and you sign up there and then you go to the forums and you make a comment and a thread well it also wouldn't surprise me if people are just trying to reach out however they can
9200000	9203243	Yeah, it's basically that's how they're doing it right now.
9203683	9213813	I signed up for it and did all that stuff just because, you know, I'd like to play Mega Man Legends 3 and, you know, I'm not going to beg them to release it, but I'll support the movement, I guess.
9214614	9220139	Well, right now they're up to 36,428, so they're about a third of the way there, so we'll see what happens.
9221178	9224161	So, I mean, no word on what happens when they hit 100,000.
9224841	9226042	I mean, Capcom hasn't said.
9226082	9229045	Capcom will go, thanks for your support.
9229565	9234209	Capcom will say, wow, that's 100,000 people that are getting this game still.
9235748	9236268	DeadRising2 DeadRising2
9260626	9277757	Tronbon's in there so we love the Mega Man Legends series but there's no Mega Man characters at all so they put in there you know oh there's alternate DLC because Legends never die and neither does like fashion or something like that it's like I know that's literally Capcom giving the finger to that group
9279858	9283081	I really need to find that quote because it was hilarious.
9302626	9304630	While you find that, let's go to DarkSakura.
9304650	9306354	I think he has some more hilarious stuff for us.
9306655	9310222	By the way, the Skype line is coming up as well as your Twitter topics in just a little bit.
9312030	9313050	Oh, oh, oh.
9313431	9321713	This is, it's kind of, I'm, you know how people are always finding little Easter eggs in games much later after the games have been out?
9322093	9331956	You know, sort of like the blowing on the Famicom speaker to make the pulse voice disappear and all that?
9332776	9336037	Apparently Bomberman will eat your dust and lick your crack.
9337595	9340616	I'll break your fucking head with a ratchet!
9341056	9343037	I'll break your fucking head with a ratchet!
9343657	9346038	I'll break your fucking head with a ratchet!
9346619	9348639	I'll break your fucking head with a ratchet!
9361244	9387540	but it has I'm so fucking proud of you I could just shit you should play that one, that one's great if I can find it I am so fucking proud of you I could just shit eat my dust and lick my crack there's like oh my ass and there's one that says I'll slap you down and shit that's right there tits
9389390	9391091	The one after that is a little funnier.
9392351	9393252	You're fucked.
9393692	9395813	No, I mean, there's like multiple sounds.
9396053	9397434	That's right there, sweet tits.
9397934	9399074	That's right there, tits.
9399555	9401996	That's right there, tits.
9402096	9403296	You talking to me, shitheel?
9405557	9407758	Wow, this would be a great soundboard for OLR.
9407818	9410019	Talk to the fist because the face is pissed.
9411740	9417783	Next time Loki and I get in an argument about Nintendo, DarkSakura could just say, Would you guys cut out this macho shit and hurry up?
9418857	9419157	Yeah.
9420258	9422419	Don't make me come out there and stomp both of your asses.
9425240	9427521	I also like my ass is killing me, I need help.
9428301	9430122	My ass is killing me, I need help.
9430142	9433704	The one after that's funny too.
9435505	9437525	That's really funny in like a second grade way.
9437545	9438066	Oh my ass.
9440527	9442430	Oh, don't fuck me.
9442450	9444012	Oh, don't fuck me.
9453171	9455513	They're gonna put out Mega Man Legends 3 after all?
9455813	9457053	Oh, no!
9457154	9457734	Fuck me.
9459035	9460356	I will tell you something about this, though.
9461016	9465619	Is that you could actually go into the sound files in the game and make your own vocal macros for the game.
9465999	9466239	Nice.
9466600	9472924	So, I think, I mean, I don't see why this is reported on now, except that, you know, I think it's freaking funny.
9473684	9475325	Pop a fucking dirt nap.
9476766	9478307	Sounds kind of like Bugs Bunny saying that.
9480007	9483848	That's kind of funny that they made all these really sick things and they were just never found, you know?
9483908	9484688	I like the last one.
9484748	9485929	You talking to me, shitheel?
9487249	9488589	You talking to me, shitheel?
9490930	9492190	Oh, no!
9492290	9492830	Fuck me.
9493070	9495411	I'll break your fucking head with a ratchet.
9497332	9498252	That one's great, too.
9501513	9504554	Xenicorn chat says, sounds like the Jerky Boys did the audio.
9504594	9505194	Yeah, kind of.
9505214	9506294	That's kind of what it sounds like.
9507365	9510627	These are the... Well, you know, another game had unused voice clips.
9510667	9512389	And actually, I was reading a little bit more about this.
9512929	9515351	It's not a story that kind of has something, you know.
9515911	9519854	Did you know in Portal 2, what's his name that did Cave Johnson?
9520634	9521515	I can never remember his name.
9521675	9522996	I know who he is, but I can never remember his name.
9523396	9524297	The guy from Spider-Man.
9524317	9526058	Yeah.
9526178	9530221	He refused to do certain lines because it sounded too much like a rape scene.
9530949	9531890	Yeah, I read that this week.
9532291	9542240	And I had posted something about it on my Tumblr, but you can find Ellen's lines, who was the voice of GLaDOS and Carolyn, saying, no, I don't want this.
9543341	9544162	You know, basically.
9544662	9548105	But there was one line that I wish they would have recorded because I would have loved to hear it.
9549146	9553931	It's after she gets put in GLaDOS, says, I'm awake and I'm going to kill you all.
9555172	9555312	So.
9556383	9562848	Okay, I found that actual, that quote, and it was from the DLC for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition.
9562888	9570153	It says, all alternate costumes for Guile, Blanka, Dhalsim, Gen, and Feilong are included in this pack.
9570553	9573596	Show everyone that legends never die and never go out of fashion.
9574857	9579480	And to which, you know, the 100,000 strongs for bringing back Maybelline Legends 3 go, seriously?
9579940	9580421	Seriously?
9581241	9581662	Seriously?
9583180	9586562	And the chat room is lighting up a minute and a half later because of the buffer.
9586602	9586982	J.K.
9587022	9588263	Simmons is who you're trying to think of.
9589104	9589324	Yes.
9591465	9591725	All right.
9592246	9593726	And Salacious Pop says he's fucking hot.
9596748	9597068	All right.
9598169	9598649	Moving on.
9599050	9605093	A couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9605754	9605934	Yes.
9606923	9611305	Sony soon enough will be saying, show me on the doll where they touched you.
9612566	9617768	Because they actually have patented some creepy looking doll thing.
9618349	9622771	And I don't know if this was the crying baby out of the PlayStation 3 commercials or what.
9623351	9625852	But apparently the patent was filed back in 2008.
9625972	9629994	It has only recently been publicized.
9631335	9635758	It's a plush toy that's packing, I guess, like a wireless receiver.
9636258	9641642	It means for reading storage medium and even a processor along with both USB and Ethernet ports.
9642482	9657052	It would act as some sort of buddy for kids who can pop a disc into their PS3 and have the console communicate with it telling it to act surprised, throw its arms up, or at a certain point, you know, at a certain point during gameplay or viewing or whatever.
9658033	9658153	Um...
9660541	9663404	Weird and creepy looking.
9664044	9670370	Wasn't there a controller like on the Wii for some type of game that was a doll and you put the Wii mode up its butt?
9670510	9671551	Yeah, there's two games.
9671811	9672091	Yeah?
9672552	9672732	Yes.
9672892	9674213	That's what this sounds like, kind of.
9674233	9675634	Not one game, two games.
9675674	9675975	Oh, my.
9676435	9679418	Well, actually, it was funny because I think one evolved into the other.
9679438	9681960	There was My Baby and Me.
9682040	9684162	I think it was from 505 Games.
9685983	9687124	and that came out in Europe.
9687244	9694828	I don't know if that came out over here, but we got Babysitting Mama also developed by the same studio that put out My Baby and Me.
9694988	9697750	But the baby was actually cute and not disturbing looking like that picture.
9698050	9698290	Yes.
9698630	9707836	Well, to be fair though, it was a holster that you could put on your baby so you could holster the remote that way instead of shoving it up its ass.
9709356	9710457	This thing is kind of creepy.
9710597	9713398	But I can see some interesting implementations to that.
9713738	9715599	Say you jailbreak your PS3.
9715839	9718800	The PS3 can send a kill signal to the doll.
9719140	9719600	Stop.
9720540	9722001	And they can attack you in your sleep.
9723161	9724842	Play fun pranks on all your family.
9727983	9733965	I'm reminded of that one Halloween episode of The Simpsons where it was like, I'm Christy the Clown and I'm going to kill you.
9734966	9735446	Little dolly.
9739521	9740422	It is creepy though.
9741242	9743824	Would you play a game that involved a doll as a peripheral Loki?
9745685	9747546	Would it have to be murder dolls or something like that?
9748106	9748546	I don't know.
9748666	9749527	It would have to be fun.
9750802	9753624	All right, one more story for you guys, and then we'll get to the Skype line.
9753664	9755165	This is about Connectimals.
9756145	9757046	Guess what was announced?
9757486	9759387	A sequel of sorts to Connectimals.
9759407	9765091	You can think of it as Connectimals Plus, or more formally, Connectimals Now With Bears.
9765491	9766672	Yes, that is exactly the name of it.
9766692	9768273	Connectimals Now With Bears.
9770194	9770714	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9792520	9793821	Do you have to throw them onto a trampoline?
9822133	9822793	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9852361	9857525	Anyhow, you can download the download content for $15 or there will be a new retail release called Connectables.
9857885	9858846	Now with bears!
9859807	9860267	Grr.
9861248	9861688	There you go.
9861788	9863329	That does it for the news tonight.
9863389	9864550	We're going to go to the Skype line.
9864670	9870254	It is open now at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9870494	9873457	You can call us right now and we will talk about whatever you want to talk about.
9873557	9875118	Any news stories tonight or what have you.
9875738	9882643	Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, let's go to the Twitter and get some tweets to read here in between waiting for some phone calls.
9882663	9883704	Oh, I've got another screen capture.
9883724	9884825	I'm going to put it in the chat room.
9885105	9886025	God, what'd you find?
9887607	9888287	Do I want to know?
9888307	9890709	It's just a couple of bears.
9891069	9892510	Oh yeah, probably gay bears, right?
9892870	9893971	They have ears.
9894872	9896012	Wearing assless chaps.
9897533	9897794	Nice.
9898594	9899575	But they have cute little ears.
9900233	9901074	CD Thunder CD Thunder
9929220	9929661	Not much.
9929741	9931542	I have a couple things I want to discuss.
9931662	9932142	Alright, what?
9934324	9937526	The two newest games that are out, Duke Nukem Forever and L.A.
9937546	9937967	Noire.
9938247	9939007	Yes, what about them?
9940528	9942450	Well, I'd like to start with the Duke Nukem Forever.
9942810	9943250	Please do.
9945292	9951716	Well, first off, yeah, I agree with what you're saying, that the graphics aren't really that great.
9953798	9955299	But Duke still has its...
9958411	9987986	um sarcasm that's made it that's made the games great over the years and and only in this could and only in this game could you kick a monster's eyeball and consider it a field goal so you kind of like the potty humor in it I mean there's no shame in that potty humor's funny once in a while I do like the wall boobs there you go I mean I but what about what's up with the girls giving him a blowjob in the very beginning because he's Duke and
9989423	9995227	Yeah, and they're acting, in the game, they're acting like he's actually playing it, and he's got the controller and everything.
9996208	9999630	Because what they're trying to do is, like, imagine this is you.
10000271	10003793	Yeah, Hot Chick's giving you a BJ while you're playing this game.
10004354	10005114	Awesome.
10005174	10006275	Isn't that awesome?
10006936	10008257	Yeah, I actually wouldn't mind that.
10009297	10009838	Exactly.
10009958	10010438	There you go.
10010758	10011239	Point made.
10011319	10012800	That's some pre-order bonus right there.
10017438	10017958	I actually like it.
10017978	10018059	It's...
10041272	10048660	I like how it's set in the 40s and everything with all the classic cars and everything, but it's not really set.
10049421	10056029	You can tell it's not a complete 40s game because they usually don't use that language, all the F words and stuff.
10057530	10060274	But besides that, it looks really fun.
10061505	10063386	So the F is for fun in this game.
10065267	10065307	Oh.
10065327	10066548	All right, forget it.
10066988	10076172	Well, I mean, this game's... The thing is... If you like the toilet humor in Duke Nukem Forever, my understanding is that you get full-on beaver in L.A.
10076212	10076593	Noire.
10076693	10079174	So, I mean, it might be a dead chick, but still...
10082029	10095602	I like how it integrates where you have to interview the person and you have to figure out on your own if they're lying or if they're acting doubtful or if they're flat out telling a lie.
10096502	10103686	Yeah, and from what I understand in the game, when you guess correct, or like, you know, you have to guess if they're telling the truth or lying, and then a little chime sounds, right?
10103706	10104326	Yeah, that's right.
10104346	10105046	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10105166	10111209	Well, what they should do is they should, instead of, like, just a dumb little chime that should sound, you should get rewarded with more pussy shots.
10112010	10112530	Don't you think?
10113451	10114931	Yeah.
10115091	10119293	And if you get it wrong, you have to look at that bear picture that DarkSakura just posted.
10119313	10124976	But if you're not, they should just, like, edit it, like, have a little blur there or something, maybe.
10125336	10125717	There you go.
10126477	10135776	there you go alright well anything else on your mind tonight CD Thunder oh let's see what other games are on your radar to play soon
10138028	10158762	I haven't actually played those two I just mentioned I was just looking at playthroughs of them but I haven't been able to listen to you guys lately because I've been working but I'm glad I've been able to tonight you guys have made my evening and rock on don't forget there is always the podcast you can take us with you in your pocket every week
10161007	10162788	All right.
10162808	10163468	Can you say something?
10163488	10163968	I couldn't hear you.
10163988	10165849	Yeah, just plug in the podcast.
10165869	10166249	That's all right.
10166529	10167529	OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

10168110	10172011	You can take us in your pocket with you and listen to us whenever you want, not just Sunday nights.
10172371	10175292	All right, CD Thunder, thanks so much for the call, and enjoy the potty humor.
10175592	10176312	Hee-hee, poop-poop party.
10176332	10176753	All right, thanks.
10176933	10177173	Bye.
10177253	10177473	Bye.
10178393	10180974	All right, let's go to another call since our phone's ringing off the hook.
10181014	10181894	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
10181914	10182234	Who's this?
10182975	10184355	Hey, let me turn down my computer.
10184395	10185236	Hey, this is Kai Judo.
10185256	10186176	Hey, Kai Judo, what's on your mind?
10186820	10188001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10206400	10207821	Yes, I remember that.
10207921	10213746	Yes, they had to like fix those dolls because yes, like some girl got their hair caught in it or something, right?
10213766	10214867	Yeah, a lot of girls.
10214907	10222914	I mean, the news report had me cracking up because like if you're a fan of horror movies, you know, there's always like some type of instruction on how to kill the monster.
10224014	10224795	Hilarious.
10225135	10226076	Yeah, you know what I'm talking about?
10227077	10232221	Yeah, so on the news, they actually had instructions on what you would have to do if you caught the Cabbage Patch Doll.
10233883	10234464	DarkSakura.com
10259195	10260116	What's the game you want to talk about?
10260136	10260636	Now it's our turn, huh?
10260656	10263338	We're the last show of the week, so it's our turn, right?
10263358	10265479	Yogi, like the bear, or the brand of tea.
10287119	10290624	Well, it comes from some type of Japanese saying.
10290664	10293928	It means to read, like it's supposed to read your opponent's mind or something.
10294549	10295670	It has some kind of mystical...
10296570	10297570	You need to Google this game.
10297610	10298631	Google Yomi and the website is Serling Games.
10321189	10321510	Is it Yomi?
10336880	10337421	Yomi, what?
10337701	10338662	Oh, not Yogi.
10338762	10340083	I was thinking Yogi Bear.
10340383	10340824	Oh, no.
10341004	10341224	All right.
10341364	10341945	So Yomi.
10342065	10342325	Okay.
10342925	10344106	Got it.
10344247	10349411	The guy who invented it, he's some type of high-ranking street fighter player.
10349591	10352314	He's done a few of those, whatever the hell you call them.
10352794	10353915	Oh, this looks kind of interesting.
10354215	10355676	I'm looking at all the cards.
10355696	10356837	The artwork looks very nice.
10358158	10363042	It's surlingames.com apparently sells this.
10363162	10366105	It's the Japanese word for reading and reading the mind of your opponent.
10366405	10369307	It's a competitive card game that simulates a battle between two characters.
10369647	10371329	It's like a fighting game, but a card game.
10371769	10372350	Interesting.
10372810	10373651	It's great, man.
10373711	10378134	And what I like about it best is it's not technically a trading card game.
10378534	10381257	There's a set amount of cards that you get
10382157	10382697	and that's it.
10382818	10384839	It's like you don't have to collect any more cards.
10384899	10389541	There aren't any like rare cards that you have to go out looking for and spending tons of money on.
10390042	10391462	It's just a complete card game.
10391562	10396385	You know what else is interesting about this is that I noticed every card has traditional card stamps on it.
10396445	10402248	Like the dodge card can substitute as a three of hearts and the flame arrow is a jack of spades.
10402308	10403289	Like that's, that's...
10404091	10410158	Yeah, every character is a deck you can actually use as a deck of playing cards.
10411219	10414763	It comes with a complete, I guess, what is it, 52 playing cards in the deck?
10414983	10415324	Yeah.
10415884	10418007	Yeah, so that's pretty much the game in a nutshell.
10418307	10418487	Yeah.
10421930	10425973	Well, there's a download version that you can, I think it's like $14.95.
10426053	10430837	You can get that, it's called Print and Play, where I guess you just print it out from your printer.
10431297	10432278	Oh, wow.
10432658	10439263	You get little card sleeves and you can play it that way, or you can go the super expensive route and get it for like $100 to complete the game.
10440396	10441516	Yeah, I'll take the cheap route.
10442257	10444538	No, but I did the math on this.
10444558	10447679	I'm not going to take up all your time, but I did the math on it because it looked pretty expensive.
10448219	10453921	But when you do the math on it, like if you buy the deck separately, each deck comes with two characters.
10454081	10458663	You're getting like two decks of playing cards, and that's like $24 in change.
10458703	10462944	So if you bought them loosely, you'll actually be paying a little bit more than what you would for the full game.
10462964	10464285	So it's not entirely...
10465066	10493116	you know what though, 100 bucks doesn't seem so bad when you consider how much I spent on magic back in the day and the website to play it online free, I'll put it in the chat room but you need to try that that I can do, free, I like that word you should have started with that alright, Kaishudo, thanks so much for the call and for the heads up on a new game alright, later I want to do tweets but we keep getting calls and I definitely want to hear what the callers have to say hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio, who's this?
10494076	10494837	Well, what's on your mind?
10494857	10495417	Happier thoughts?
10495437	10495738	Video games?
10495758	10496699	Take our mind off of that.
10517588	10518929	Good lord, video games.
10519890	10526277	I tried getting back into some games that I passed over because I wasn't sure how far their reach would be.
10526697	10539731	But since I've been on YouTube for the past two months almost non-stop, I finally decided to try out both of the Defense of the Ancient Clones, League of Legends, and Heroes of New Earth.
10540586	10542408	League of Legends, yep, I know those games.
10542688	10543268	What did you think?
10545390	10547311	I guess it depends on the time of day you're there.
10548392	10552836	Especially, it seems like these games took off more in Europe than they did here.
10553376	10556659	So while you're still getting European players, everything's calm.
10556719	10564425	You're in a newbie room and there are actually newbies playing and if there's more experienced players actually trying to help the people learn.
10564905	10567848	But the moment the afternoon comes up and all the US comes up
10568868	10571630	It's pretty much like, get the hell out you noob left and right.
10571670	10572271	It's ridiculous.
10572311	10574152	See, I hate that shit.
10574192	10576653	I wish games had a better structure for noobs how to play.
10576913	10581776	You know one game I randomly played this week I forgot to mention in my top of the week was StarCraft 2.
10582437	10585519	I just randomly was like, I want to play Star Jeweled again because I love the Star Jeweled add-on.
10585539	10586940	That made that game ten times better.
10587480	10591843	And part of me was like, I should learn how to play real StarCraft and then go online and play.
10591863	10592263	But then I'm like...
10592623	10596605	No, I'm too scared, because there's nobody like me.
10596725	10599346	Everybody that plays StarCraft Online is already really good.
10599366	10602327	Yeah, that's pretty much the truth.
10602987	10610050	I tried getting back into a game here, and of course I'm still in the Bronze League, but now Bronze League is quite seasoned, so you really have no hope.
10611210	10612591	You gotta play your buddies, and that's it.
10613496	10614697	That's about the only way to do it.
10615038	10617120	What do you think about some of the upcoming Defense of the Ancients?
10617140	10624246	Like there's a Blizzard DOTA coming to StarCraft 2, speaking of which, and then we have actual DOTA 2 from Valve soon.
10625226	10626327	I'm not holding my breath.
10626467	10627948	The game is not going to change at all.
10628248	10631490	I mean, it's going to play almost exactly the same.
10632330	10638213	Even like with Heroes of New Earth and League of Legends, the only thing they really change is the functionality of the game.
10639014	10641655	And switching from one to the other is painful.
10641695	10644777	You get set up for the way one game works and it messes you up for the other.
10645437	10647319	You pretty much got to pick your flavor and stick with it.
10647619	10649740	So who do you think will walk away victorious at the end of the day?
10649820	10651421	Blizzard, Valve, or one of these other games?
10651912	10653641	I hope they all drop, to tell you the truth.
10653661	10654988	They need to work on something more original.
10657780	10658361	Touche.
10658381	10662905	Hey, I told that to a Blizzard headhunter while I was in school.
10663325	10664106	I called him out on it.
10664126	10668269	It's like, why does Warcraft 3 play like Warcraft 2 and Starcraft?
10670171	10672152	Yeah, everybody was in there like, ooh.
10672172	10674134	Because they sell gazillions.
10674734	10676055	That's why they all play the same.
10676556	10677657	Yeah, exactly.
10677697	10678918	Because it's the same damn game.
10679839	10681820	And I heard he actually wanted to talk to me after the...
10684142	10691224	after the headhunter briefing he was doing at the school, but I think I already left in disgust, so I didn't get a chance to give it to him directly.
10691924	10693484	Who knows, I might have missed that on the job.
10695164	10695524	Nice.
10695845	10696985	Well, good luck.
10697125	10700726	I hope maybe you'll get a second shot with Blizzard at some point.
10700806	10702826	Don't mention that all the games are the same.
10704286	10705787	Also, I got one final thing for you.
10705827	10712128	Has anybody seen the Comic-Con coverage for the Star Wars MMO?
10713721	10715002	Not extensively.
10715102	10718544	I haven't been really watching this carefully.
10718604	10722045	I'm kind of just waiting for when the game gets really closer to release.
10722125	10724326	But I know a lot did come out of Comic-Con.
10725307	10731050	Based off what I saw, because they showed the first part of an instance adventure.
10732391	10736673	And any WoWhead that played this game, I don't think you're really going to see any difference.
10737473	10740615	Based off what I saw in the video, I mean, it's up on YouTube now.
10741315	10745597	But based off that footage, you still have the same tropes.
10746238	10750240	You still have the same player classes, the same structure.
10750400	10751100	That's what I heard.
10751140	10753681	It's about what Star Wars laid over it.
10753901	10755502	And I was really hoping for a little bit more.
10755562	10756843	Where can I find that video?
10758164	10759264	YouTube.
10759505	10762867	I'll see if I can dig up the link for you and put it in chat.
10763167	10764588	Do that for me and I'll check it out here in a minute.
10765129	10765449	Yeah, man.
10765489	10766910	That's pretty much all I had.
10767511	10773355	I'd say wait until you see more footage on the game before you make a decision to do the initial investment.
10773655	10775497	Well, we'll see how much it is.
10776077	10778219	I definitely won't get that collector's edition, but you never know.
10778559	10781161	Especially if they cut the price as fast as they did on Rift.
10781682	10783563	I definitely have no excuse not to check it out.
10784192	10787301	Yeah, but this LucasArts stuff, they're not cutting that price anytime soon.
10787381	10787843	That's true.
10788264	10790430	Alright, Xenocore, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can get more calls.
10790571	10790851	Take care.
10791448	10792489	Alright, I'll dig into that link for you.
10792509	10792809	Take care.
10792969	10793409	Thanks, bye.
10820867	10825451	Game Addict 20 killed by deep vein thrombosis.
10825832	10832237	Apparently a 20-year-old died from a blood clot because he played his Xbox for up to 12 hours at a time.
10832897	10841605	And his parents, of course, were stunned by it, saying, quote, As a parent, you think playing computer games can't do them any harm because you know what they are doing.
10842125	10844787	Kids all over the country are playing these games for long periods.
10844867	10846529	They don't realize it could kill them.
10847625	10849787	I mean, 12 hours at a time though?
10850809	10852871	That's just excessive.
10853552	10855193	That was not a good way to do it.
10855554	10859138	That's the parents not interfering and saying, hey, you need to slack off.
10860559	10860840	Yeah.
10861701	10865985	Or maybe your kid was obsessive and you should have put a stop to it.
10866246	10866586	That too.
10867727	10868188	There is that.
10869488	10871349	Alright, let's see, going on to more tweets.
10871889	10877552	Ramaditya Knight tweets us saying, Hi OLR, have any of you played Action 52 for the NES?
10877632	10879733	This is another one of those multi-cart games, isn't it?
10880273	10881173	I don't think I have.
10881333	10882354	Let me look it up real quick.
10882374	10883274	I want to see what this is.
10883715	10885595	Does that sound familiar, DarkSakura?
10885876	10887356	You know a lot of the old school stuff.
10887916	10889737	Yeah, but I never played multi-carts.
10890358	10895540	I recognize a lot of the names just from ROM sets, but I haven't really played it.
10895960	10897841	Why bother playing a multi-cart when you can play the actual game?
10898135	10899596	I am actually looking at the multi-card.
10899637	10904581	It did come out in 91 and then it was also out in 93 for Genesis consoles.
10904641	10907424	They say a lot of the titles had major glitches in it.
10907824	10910086	Let me get to the next call and we'll talk more about this in a minute.
10910466	10911467	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10911487	10911808	Who's this?
10913083	10913743	Hey, it's Sterlok.
10913964	10915064	Hey, Sterlok, what's up, buddy?
10916425	10916745	Not much.
10917806	10921628	I just wanted to say well-played Nintendo, well-played.
10922249	10924330	Ah, I was hoping somebody would call in on this.
10924450	10926712	What did you think about all this Nintendo news this week?
10929593	10938079	It's both, you can tell, you know, they were desperate because the 3DS hasn't really been selling well because they really should have waited like another year.
10939321	10940341	Or at least tell the holidays.
10941021	10941742	Yeah.
10942582	10950663	But at the same time, the way they did it was just fucking genius because everybody wins.
10951964	10964266	People who have waited, which is probably a lot of people because people are waiting for your actual games to come out and for a price drop.
10965986	10968367	And people who have already bought the system
10969046	10973207	They're getting 20 free games and some exclusive stuff.
10974788	10975648	It's good for everybody.
10977308	10996634	Also, it's really good for Nintendo because they've really made sure by doing this that the 3DS is probably going to end up being the number one Christmas gift this year with the price drop.
10997352	11009015	You know, I could see, though, to be fair, as much as I pretty much agree with you on all these points, to be fair, I could see where somebody could still be pissed off at Nintendo because maybe these 20 games, maybe Virtual Console just isn't really interesting to them.
11009175	11013796	Or, you know, they already bought them all on the Wii, so they don't really want them on the 3DS.
11013916	11015216	It's kind of like, $80?
11016396	11017717	You know, that's still a steep cut.
11018257	11019297	Maybe getting free stuff.
11019357	11024018	I mean, they could have just gone, eh, yeah, we're not going to
11025210	11026471	We're not going to throw you a bone.
11026652	11027712	And look at Apple.
11028473	11028693	Yeah.
11029254	11030875	It's just the price of being an early adopter.
11030915	11034338	And that's not even just with the 3DS.
11034358	11035639	That's with games in general.
11035739	11039442	Dude, Loki just mentioned the price of Duke Nukem Forever dropped already.
11039522	11041844	That game is maybe two months old.
11042044	11043105	That's pretty sad.
11043125	11044186	You didn't get nothing for free.
11044226	11047089	No free hats for being an early adopter.
11047229	11048970	So, I mean, this is just the nature of the beast.
11049331	11049531	Yeah.
11050452	11051673	But I think it's...
11054351	11074351	I thought it was brilliant that they put the spin on it that they did because yeah it was a desperate act but it's going to I think it's really going to save them in the long run because you know like eventually like well the like the DS launch was kind of shitty too
11075148	11077310	That didn't have very many good games for a while.
11077650	11078231	That's true.
11078271	11079251	But look at it now.
11079451	11085576	The thing it had going for most of all was the Mario 64 port that was on it.
11086277	11089700	But now it's the best-selling handheld, like, pretty much ever.
11090741	11091781	That's very true.
11091801	11095625	Like the original Game Boy, but it's doing well.
11096125	11096385	It is.
11096405	11099328	All right, well, any other thoughts on your mind tonight before we let you go?
11101709	11102050	Yeah.
11102710	11104272	I'll crack your head with a fucking ratchet.
11105529	11106210	Gee, thanks.
11107551	11108092	All right, buddy.
11108132	11108913	Thanks for the call.
11109493	11110054	All right, later.
11110615	11111916	I wish I still had that soundboard up.
11111956	11113418	I would have played something in response to that.
11113458	11114759	It's on our Tumblr.
11115640	11117502	I just, I don't have the Tumblr up.
11118080	11119420	All right, that's going to do it for the calls tonight.
11119440	11120721	We've got to get through the rest of these tweets.
11120981	11122761	Thank you guys for calling tonight.
11122801	11129343	Sorry if you didn't get through, but you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, or you might be able to get a last-minute tweet in real quick.
11129883	11133064	Look at the suggested retail of Action 52, $200.
11134584	11138465	But it really was, I guess, like 52 different games that were in it.
11138505	11140765	They were all different games.
11140825	11141886	I'm sure they were all shitty.
11142946	11145406	In fact, one of them, I guess, crashes right when you start it up.
11146747	11147047	Awesome.
11148367	11149568	Alright, let's see.
11149668	11152649	Going on to more tweets here at Twitter.com slash OLR.
11153009	11157250	MNZiba tweets us about, you know, we were talking earlier in the show about WTF Battleship.
11157671	11161192	She tweeted us the Monopoly parody movie trailer.
11161212	11163893	I don't know if I want to play this whole thing, but we can start in the beginning here.
11165253	11165694	Let's see.
11166674	11175617	Richie Benjamin never followed in his father's footsteps until one day when all that changed.
11175817	11177018	This is where your father left you.
11180856	11181496	A board game?
11189278	11190218	Thanks a lot, Dad.
11199160	11201760	He threw all the houses on the ground and then of course the house shook.
11204581	11206161	In a world where money matters...
11210677	11211778	You lost, kid?
11211978	11212578	Who are you?
11217200	11220582	For the first time in his life, Richie is taking a chance.
11222183	11229347	I want to teach you all about the game.
11229367	11230767	And rolling the dice.
11231408	11232869	Yeah, it's got strippers.
11233269	11235230	This is already better than the Battleship trailer.
11236090	11237511	Never fall in love.
11240089	11241369	Unless it's with money.
11241389	11245931	It's a community chest.
11245991	11248972	But I love her.
11249032	11249732	This is great.
11250372	11252133	Love her more than money?
11252693	11253973	I don't care what you think.
11254493	11256234	Because now I have the monopoly.
11256454	11257894	Oh, son, don't you know?
11258054	11260375	Only I can win this game.
11263212	11264933	Do not pass out.
11264993	11266814	You didn't pay the luxury tax.
11267054	11268134	Go to jail.
11268154	11269475	Do not collect $200.
11269595	11270335	That was great.
11270355	11271976	I would see that.
11291343	11294925	They should screen that at midnight at the shadiest looking theater in town.
11297047	11298107	After Rocky Horror, of course.
11299729	11300009	Of course.
11302310	11305272	Actdeft tweets us something that somehow we missed in our news feed tonight.
11305352	11308354	Dragon Age got removed from Steam because of DLC issues.
11308874	11312297	Basically EA has a lot of sand in their vagina and it basically has to do with Origin.
11313277	11315459	But I guess what they're saying is it has to do with the whole...
11316299	11321624	It's that whole thing where Steam wants to control the download stuff, but EA really wants that in their own house.
11322304	11322845	Herpaderp.
11322945	11323966	EA says, Whatever.
11323986	11324306	Whatever.
11344758	11345259	That's a bummer.
11345659	11346780	Dragon Age is a pretty cool game.
11348943	11357753	Apparently, Dartituya is tweeting us saying, WonderCon 2012 moved from San Francisco to Anaheim just for the next year.
11358293	11359715	That's kind of a big deal.
11360316	11361577	Like, that's...
11362438	11363639	Wondercon New York Comic Con
11383553	11389019	Oh, but they're saying now, there are some updates saying nothing has actually been confirmed about this.
11389840	11392083	I guess Anaheim is in discussion right now.
11392824	11393925	So it's don't freak out yet.
11393945	11395527	Yeah, maybe it's don't freak out yet.
11397729	11398150	Let's see.
11398470	11402675	DarkTetsuya is saying, wonder what the holdup was for the worldwide release of La Mulana?
11403196	11403957	It's Germany!
11405546	11408608	I guess La Mulana has been held up for release in Germany.
11408668	11409169	What is it?
11410310	11410950	Trying to read here.
11412031	11424681	The ratings board of Germany, the USK, Nigoro, who developed the game, submitted the game for review to the ESRB, the OFLC, and the USK two months ago.
11425722	11429945	The other two boards have the game ready to go, but the USK has not finished yet.
11430865	11431286	Interesting.
11432207	11434008	I guess they can't release it until it gets reviewed.
11434889	11435469	Sorry, Joe.
11435529	11437191	I know you're a big fan of La Mulana.
11437911	11438391	Maybe soon.
11439112	11442114	Spazinator giving us an update on the PS3 saga.
11442555	11445277	I sent my PS3 in for repairs this past Friday.
11445637	11447959	I figure that I'm likely to get it back early next week.
11448419	11448980	We will see.
11450021	11454704	SSJ100Matt tweets us saying, The only way to defeat China is to attack their productivity.
11455085	11456226	Coming soon to China.
11456526	11457327	Angry birds.
11459408	11459868	That's right.
11459988	11462210	Angry Birds is coming to China.
11463350	11466252	I guess in order to prevent knockoffs and so forth.
11466312	11466612	I don't know.
11466973	11471656	It was officially launched in May through a partnership with Chinese mobile games network Downjoy.
11472576	11477519	But so far there's been all these knockoffs and pirated versions on jailbroken iPhones.
11477940	11484124	But now Rovio has teamed up with the ad network Madhouse to try and expand the game's presence.
11485546	11491942	I still say Angry Birds isn't really all that and I don't understand why so many people are so losing their shit over it.
11492242	11492603	Amen.
11496913	11498754	TigerClaw sends us a tweet here.
11499215	11503137	Samsung is going to be manufacturing the PlayStation Vita CPU.
11503838	11511843	The core processing unit or central processing unit of Samsung's upcoming portable will be, excuse me, by Sony's upcoming portable will be done by Samsung.
11511863	11513124	These are from Samsung.
11513184	11515606	These are from online reports out of Japan.
11516427	11521670	This was on the website of Japanese industry paper, the Semiconductor Industry News.
11522851	11526074	Not a lot of further context besides just that.
11526134	11526714	But there you go.
11526754	11531738	Samsung will play a role in the actual development of the Vita.
11532739	11533219	There it is.
11533960	11534860	Your Twitter topics.
11534920	11538863	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to get in your tweets in the future.
11539484	11544908	By the way, did you hear about the last sales reports on smartphones?
11545628	11548110	Motorola's dipped way down.
11548210	11548971	Well, yeah.
11549171	11550252	Blackberry's going out.
11550572	11553074	It's all Androids and iPhones now.
11553634	11556376	The top three is Apple, Samsung, and Nokia.
11557216	11557537	Interesting.
11557577	11559658	I would think BlackBerrys are still big in the corporate world.
11560559	11561059	Interesting.
11561399	11562320	They've gone way down.
11562780	11564081	They're not in the top three.
11564841	11565182	Interesting.
11566232	11566492	All right.
11567273	11572497	Well, before we close out the show tonight, I've got to go to Loki and ask if there's any last-minute stories he wants to tear through.
11574158	11574358	No.
11575059	11575339	Wow.
11576080	11577681	We covered quite a bit of everything.
11577701	11578441	I guess so.
11579582	11580063	There you go.
11580903	11581224	All right.
11581264	11586267	Well, we'll work on more last-minute stories for next week, but I guess we've covered everything so far tonight.
11586608	11591952	If you think we missed a topic, you can always email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and we'll bring it up on next week's show.

11603641	11605543	Get more butts in our chat room on Sunday night.

11607784	11610507	Even if you're like, I don't really know who I could tell about Orange Launch Radio.
11610727	11612248	Help spread the word on websites.
11612568	11614450	There's people that put signatures on forums.
11615151	11622899	or just as simple as leaving a five-star review in iTunes really goes a long way because that drives the popularity rankings and helps us get exposure to more people.
11623620	11631408	There's been some reports on the internet this week that I've seen come up on Google Plus and all that of people linking stories saying, podcasting is dying.
11631829	11632730	Well, to that I say...
11634451	11661558	because maybe corporate podcasting is dying but people like us were never really in it for the money anyways and we were doing this since before podcasting we're not going away anytime soon we're awesome sauce but we can still use every piece of word of mouth we can get and we'll continue to provide this show for your work day and whatever else so there you go but we can't have call it a show until we get around and get everybody's final thoughts so Dark Sakura what's your final thought tonight
11662650	11663951	I think we're going to miss Pinkberry.
11664872	11667854	Yes, this makes me sad, but we'll do it another time.
11668234	11668835	Maybe on Tuesday.
11668855	11670796	But I would like to do a tiny little plug.
11671756	11671977	Please.
11672177	11678421	Look on Geek Life tomorrow, geek-life.com for a special Geeks in History that has to do with Nintendo.

11681857	11682257	Very cool.
11683158	11684359	Loki, your last minute story tonight.
11684379	11686520	I don't have any last minute stories.
11686821	11688262	Excuse me, your final thought tonight.
11689823	11696528	Fortunately, today is both very sad and kind of happy tomorrow, though.
11697288	11701992	Sad because it is the two-year anniversary of the twins' death, unfortunately.
11702572	11704814	We lost two babies two years ago.
11704834	11705655	Yeah.
11706255	11709337	However happy news though, Josh's first birthday is tomorrow.
11709457	11711238	So happy birthday to Josh.
11711318	11714079	I never realized it was in such close proximity to each other.
11714099	11716540	Yes, everything is on the 31st of the 1st.
11717321	11717921	Interesting.
11718101	11723324	Well, you know, looking forward to Josh's first birthday.
11723364	11726185	I'm looking forward to seeing pictures of the mess he's going to make.
11726869	11729371	Oh, we've already fed him that kind of stuff.
11729571	11732173	Is there anything like Extifer's nephew in that party?
11732433	11739398	We actually had professional pictures taken of him and he's eating a cupcake and that was funny.
11739438	11739938	Oh, that's cute.
11740138	11747684	We had a picture of my brother Matthew when he was, one, sitting in his high chair with a cake in front of him and half the cake demolished by...
11748084	11750205	Smash, smash, smash, smash!
11750446	11752747	I think there's a picture like that of me out there somewhere, too.
11752827	11753848	You'll never see it.
11753888	11756950	He's having his birthday party next Saturday.
11757210	11758951	It is a pork-themed party.
11760692	11760972	Awesome.
11762013	11763574	So we all have a little piggy cake then.
11763634	11765635	We do want the leftovers.
11766316	11770278	Tomorrow we're taking him to... At least I do, maybe not DarkSakura.
11770298	11773240	We're taking him to the Galleria to go on the merry-go-round.
11773660	11774020	Oh, fun.
11775061	11775341	Good time.
11775361	11776242	And maybe have some ice cream.
11777530	11793824	my final thought tonight is there may not be time for Pinkberry but there's always time for tacos yes that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry thanks again for tuning in and spending your day with us your past three hours or what have you we really appreciate it and guess what we're going to do it all again next week goodnight
