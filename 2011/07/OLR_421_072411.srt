Tonight, July 24th, 2011

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Games appear to be incoming to Google Plus

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Sony experiments with Virtual Reality

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And you know we've got to talk about Capcom

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and welcome back to another week of the show

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
where every gamer has a voice

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Orange Lounge Radio

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to talk about video games and gaming culture

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and all of that with my co-host

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the one and only Dark Sakura

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Jamie Summers

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How are you doing?

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Wasn't there a video game like that in Japan

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that was all about putting your thumbs up

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
people's butts and things like that?

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not even lying, that was actually the premise

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, it was like a boonga boonga or something

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Who wants to be a proctologist?

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But it was like spanking people stressfully

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
for something, you could either use your finger

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
or spank them

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I know and I'm stressed out

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Dark Sakura, you've been very very naughty

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you sir, may I have another?

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Alright, say hello as well to the one and only

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Rob Foster, Loki!

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
How are you doing, Loki?

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You're actually muted, there you go

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How are you doing now, Loki?

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm doing better

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're having mic fail tonight in studio

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If I sound different by the way, don't adjust your speakers

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's on our end, I'm on backup mic tonight

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He's on helium

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes, maybe a little bit

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No, I think I'm just on the overly sensitive mic

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
which for my voice is really not good

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but that's all we got tonight

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's switch mics

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I have a rant or two in you tonight

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and I'm not letting you do that on this mic

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You will blow up speakers across America

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and beyond

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well what's new in your world, Loki?

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Nothing

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So Josh is turning one very soon, right?

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah, a week from Monday

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Your baby is turning one

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and the other week you were talking about

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
your possible party plans you were doing

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and I was talking to the wife today

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and it sounds like you guys have settled on a theme, correct?

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well yeah, it was always going to be

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
like the pork party

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh, I thought at one point you were talking about

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
the pedo bear party or the...

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No, those were just funny ideas we were throwing around

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I see, I see

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So you are going to do the pork party?

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Teach the child at a young age about the wonders of bacon, right?

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Of course

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well have fun with that, that'll be a lot of fun

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright, we're going to have fun with you guys here

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
live at All Games Radio

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
www.allgames.com

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
as we do every week, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
9 o'clock Eastern

76
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
at the Bobby Black Wolf Show

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you want to join us and chat, we are ready to go

78
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
in our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and we do read comments

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
from chat throughout the show

81
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
For instance, some folks commenting

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
on Booga Booga, the game we were talking about

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
a minute ago, Act Def says

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
that game didn't make it outside of Japan

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I wonder why, y'all

86
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But no, like Google it

87
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
it was a real game

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
so it's something else

89
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I had the money and it was cheap enough

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'd import it, it's really expensive

91
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Give that to Josh for his birthday

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It'd just be fun to have

93
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
just put it in my garage

94
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What the hell's that?

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey guys, want to come over?

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You guys would come over if I said, hey guys

97
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I got Booga Booga in my garage

98
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'd be like, hell yeah, I'm coming over

99
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'd be like, I'll be there in 15

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It'd just be weird

101
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hide your cameras

102
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We always like to start off the show

103
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
with a little bit of how is your gaming week

104
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So let's go around and talk about the video games

105
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
we've been playing this week

106
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
DarkSakura, what have you been doing?

107
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I played well

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I finally hit my next item level

109
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Congrats, addict, dealer

110
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I played some other games

111
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I played Kid Dracula

112
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
again, because I love that game

113
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Going back, kicking it Game Boy

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Kid Dracula is an old ass game

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah

116
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We actually watched a playthrough

117
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
of the NES version

118
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I was playing the Game Boy version

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and I have been fighting and fighting with Planet Harriers

120
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to get it to work on MAME

121
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
to no avail

122
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's because it's not done yet

123
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I know, but there's Hikaru, Bios

124
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and all this other stuff I was playing with

125
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and it's not working

126
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So

127
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So some classic gaming in your week

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, lots of classic gaming

129
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and Peggle

130
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Which is destined to become a classic in the future

131
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I think

132
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's too new

133
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hopefully EA won't ruin the franchise

134
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I did find out, however, that someone did

135
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
bejeweled for the Cliccovision

136
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh really? Like a homebrew?

137
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah, bejeweled for the Cliccovision

138
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Does it actually exist on an actual cartridge

139
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
or is it, you can't really do that

140
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
it's only through emulators

141
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sure, anything that's a ROM

142
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
you can put on a cartridge

143
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
as long as you have the right, you know

144
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
thing to write to it

145
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Dan also found something

146
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
this Cliccovision that they were going to be working on

147
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
that they

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
halted production, but someone finished it

149
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and has like a full arcade version

150
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
of Donkey Kong

151
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So Dan was playing that day and then he played the homebrew

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Donkey Kong 2 on his computer today

153
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So we've been all about the homebrew

154
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I saw an

155
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
interesting little cabinet the other day

156
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was at this pizza joint in town

157
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that had, it wasn't an old

158
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll tell you that right off the bat

159
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It was some other type of machine that had a lot

160
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
of classic games in it, but the interesting thing about it

161
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
is it was Pac-Man

162
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and Donkey Kong and Galaga

163
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and it was kind of like, you don't usually

164
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
see Nintendo games participating

165
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
in the collections

166
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
because Nintendo keeps that

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
stuff to Nintendo, so it was kind of weird

168
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
like where did this, like the Play Choice

169
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, where did, no it wasn't Play Choice though

170
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
it was like actual arcade Pac-Man and Galaga

171
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and stuff, so

172
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's talk about the Nintendo ones, oh yeah I remember those

173
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The Nintendo were the Play Choice games, or like the Wii

174
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and stuff now, you don't see a lot of like the retro

175
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It had to have been the homebrew type of

176
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't know, it was interesting

177
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
though, because I remember

178
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
SalaciousPop commenting on it like, those are

179
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
games you wouldn't usually see together in a collection

180
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, but I don't think it's a homebrew

181
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
thing, they have

182
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
other machines that are very similar to

183
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
you know

184
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
the

185
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
multi-game machines, they have like

186
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
packs that you can buy

187
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
so it's like okay, here's Atari games, here's

188
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Nintendo, here's

189
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Capcom or whatever

190
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So they've got those out there

191
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's just I didn't know Nintendo to usually participate

192
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
in those, usually it's kind of like they

193
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
keep it for their own systems and so forth

194
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Eh, maybe

195
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Alright well let's move on, Loki how was your gaming week?

196
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Same old

197
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
stuff, didn't really play a whole ton

198
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
of stuff other than basically

199
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Grand Theft Auto and

200
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I think I did play a little

201
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
bit of Earth Defense Force in there this

202
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
week, mainly Grand Theft

203
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Auto

204
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Just, you know

205
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What do you expect when I play at lunch all the time?

206
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's basically

207
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
what we've been doing

208
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I thought that was going to get replaced with Earth Defense Force

209
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
in South Armageddon now that that was out

210
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It does, but here's the thing

211
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
My boss usually wants to play during lunch

212
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and you know, it's only so many

213
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
players for Earth Defense Force

214
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You don't have a third copy

215
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You know, he just really

216
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
puts the peer pressure on

217
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
about wanting to get kicked

218
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
get his ass kicked

219
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
in Grand Theft Auto and so I have to

220
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
oblige, you know

221
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Are you going to tell your

222
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
boss, no I'm not going to come speak to your ass

223
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
at Grand Theft Auto? Thank you for reminding me

224
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Has he ever threatened to fire you over how good

225
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
you are at Grand Theft Auto? Yes, lots of times

226
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Almost

227
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
every week

228
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm always like, you know we have reviews

229
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
coming up soon

230
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm like, I don't care

231
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No, it was funny

232
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We have these nice

233
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Sony headsets

234
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Like, headphones, I should say, not headsets

235
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Headphones that we use

236
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
for the gameplay

237
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We have it hooked up through the stereo connectors

238
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
on all the VGA cables

239
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But, you know

240
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
As you know, you can't really

241
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
talk over a headset

242
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
because the headset goes on your head

243
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and it's usually meant for people that have TVs

244
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Really? A headset goes on your head? Yeah, I know

245
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
A headset goes on your head

246
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I've been doing it wrong!

247
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You'd have to wear a second pair, like a second set of

248
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
headphones on top of it, so it's just

249
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
not practical

250
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So what did I do? I thought, hey, you know what?

251
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I got a few of these wired headsets

252
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
from Microsoft, I'm going to break them apart

253
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and make them work

254
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And so that's what I did, I snapped the

255
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
headpiece off

256
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
broke the thing apart, I took out the

257
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
actual speaker from the

258
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
headphone, and then of course

259
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the only way I could attach it to it is with

260
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
plain old

261
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
tape

262
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Scotch tape

263
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Not even duct tape

264
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Here's the reason why I did Scotch tape

265
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
because these are nice headphones

266
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't want to ruin them

267
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I just want it to stay

268
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And it works great, because now we have the nice headphones

269
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and we can talk

270
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
you know, for the occasional

271
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
person that's from

272
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Mexico, or

273
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Usually it's the UK

274
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We've got people that complain in the UK

275
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and every now and then it's like

276
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
gee, I really wish I had a headset so I could

277
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
tell them to shut the hell up, because

278
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
you know, they'll be like, oh, you have

279
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
to use the stickies to kill me, what?

280
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You suck, you just can't, you know

281
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
kill me with anything else, so then I proceed to kill

282
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
them with every weapon in the game, and then they still

283
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
complain, so

284
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So you've gotten in lately

285
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
long story short, you've fixed headphones

286
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
so that you could smack talk people on

287
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Xbox Live this week. Yes. And what types of things

288
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
do you tell them off with? Do you want some

289
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
tea and crumpets with your wine? I haven't really

290
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
been using it to talk. I originally

291
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
gave it to my coworker, Jason

292
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
unfortunately we had to take it away from him because

293
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
all he kept doing throughout

294
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
the first game was going, hello

295
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
hello

296
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and we're like, listen

297
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
okay, you're not going to talk like a rapist

298
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
over the god damn

299
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
you know, headset, or taking that damn

300
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
thing away from you. No, I gave it to

301
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
my other coworker, Rob now, and he

302
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
uh, he'll usually do a Julia

303
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
child impersonation on the

304
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
which is pretty fun. First we're going to get

305
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
the cake and kill you with it. It's all

306
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hello, boobies!

307
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Wait, that sounds like Dame Edna

308
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
actually. Hello, my

309
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
puppets!

310
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well unto your death!

311
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I didn't say that his, you know,

312
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
impersonations were good, but he'll do like

313
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
you know, the French Knight

314
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
from, you know... Shall I kill you

315
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
with my sticky whip?

316
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But there's some pretty funny ones

317
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
like, I love playing with the people in the

318
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
UK because I love their

319
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
accent, and the kids that we play with on there

320
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you know, I'm going to get

321
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
the orange, fella! You know, just like

322
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
really proper English is hilarious

323
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
to me.

324
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
By the way, I didn't think

325
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
any British impersonation could be

326
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
worse than mine, but yours is really

327
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
bad. Well, I was doing an

328
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
impersonation when he does. I

329
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
can't vouch for his impersonation

330
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
of anything, but no,

331
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
it's just fun.

332
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Really, this is just a temporary thing

333
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
until I get my Saints Row

334
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
headset. Now, we do know that

335
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the Saints Row Collector's Edition headset is not

336
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
compatible through Live

337
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
without some adapters

338
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
that I can easily find.

339
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So I will have my auto-tuned

340
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
voice. They're selling headsets for Saints Row

341
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
that you can't use for Live? Yes, it comes

342
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
with the Collector's Edition. It's only meant for

343
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
PCs and phones.

344
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay. It's because it's got a

345
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
3.5 millimeter

346
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
connection, whereas most of those things are

347
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
2.5. They were too cheap to make a deal with Microsoft?

348
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes, they were too cheap, so basically

349
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
there's a thing that you can get

350
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
that splits

351
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
a headset

352
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
into the, you know,

353
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
both the speaker and the microphone

354
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
port, and then there's something in the reverse

355
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that goes to 2.5 millimeters, so

356
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can get

357
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
that stuff, and I can make it

358
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
work. I've already figured it out.

359
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I've already bookmarked this stuff on Amazon.

360
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's all a matter of waiting now.

361
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm surprised you don't own one

362
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
of those little trash talker things

363
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
for Xbox. I know SSG100 Matt's been on

364
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
the show before talking about those.

365
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They were using, well, we all were playing

366
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Perfect Dark one night with some of the understation

367
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Live people. He was using one of those frickin'

368
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
trash talk devices.

369
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I was gonna do one better on that,

370
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
as I was actually going to, and I can do this

371
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
once I get that actual

372
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
device to connect my auto-tune

373
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
headset, is

374
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
you hook up a splitter to it, and then you hook it up to your

375
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
iPod or iPhone or whatever,

376
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and just pull up a soundboard

377
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and tap away.

378
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But yes, the trash talk's pretty awesome.

379
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's only four. I mean, sometimes you want

380
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Duke Nukem to see a few other things

381
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
other than the four preset stuff.

382
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's right. Four insults

383
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
is very limiting. Exactly.

384
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Repeat yourself a little much. Alright.

385
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And pushing buttons on the headset

386
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and stuff to make Duke Nukem

387
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
say things. It's funny, but see, the problem is

388
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
because I cut the speaker

389
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
off, so I can't hear what it's

390
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
actually saying, I can't hear myself talk

391
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
over everything.

392
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I can only

393
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
hear my coworkers saying,

394
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
oh yeah, I heard you.

395
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's the only way.

396
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So, good luck in your trash talking with

397
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
the Brits adventure.

398
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Whatever comes of that.

399
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Let's see, my gaming week.

400
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Actually, not a whole lot of new stuff.

401
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I had a very Jamie week. All I really played

402
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
was wow, this week.

403
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I did play a few other things

404
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
though. There was a few other things I played.

405
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Like, I went back to the fitness game,

406
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and I gave that another go. Remember I razzed that game

407
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
on the show last week, the Urself Fitness,

408
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
because it didn't have me stretch beforehand.

409
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Well, this time I stretched,

410
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and what do you know? I made it a lot further

411
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
in the opening act. I actually made it

412
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
through the entire calibration this time,

413
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and didn't feel like

414
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
dying the next day. My legs were a little

415
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
sore that night, but it wasn't nearly the

416
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
pain and suffering I went through the week before.

417
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Like, I'm actually walking today.

418
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's a miracle. If you really want to see it.

419
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why don't you come over to my place? Why do I always have to come over here?

420
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You should come pet the kiddies.

421
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I do want to go to your place, but you've never

422
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
given me your address, silly Rob.

423
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Well, my address is...

424
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh, wait. I can't say it here.

425
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Alright.

426
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
One, two, three, any street.

427
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Anytown, USA.

428
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's right. Anytown, USA.

429
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Actually, true story, I will give you

430
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I will give you a hint

431
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
to where I live. I live not far

432
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
from a place called Safetyville, USA.

433
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
No shit. There's this little

434
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
place, and everybody

435
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
you see a sign for it on the freeway, and everybody

436
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
drives by going, what the fuck is Safetyville, USA?

437
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's a place where they

438
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
take kids in elementary school

439
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and it's one of those tiny

440
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
towns where all the buildings are built

441
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
at a kid's height or whatever

442
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
so that when they're walking through the town, they're little

443
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Godzillas in the town, but it's where they learn about

444
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
safety and look both ways

445
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
before you cross the street, or the little plastic cars

446
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
will get you, you know, things like that.

447
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But it's adorable to drive by and look at

448
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
because it's all these tiny, chibi little buildings.

449
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So I don't know why, but Loki talking about

450
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Anytown, USA, maybe think of Safetyville, USA.

451
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's like that town in hot fuzz.

452
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I guess.

453
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I haven't seen hot fuzz, so I guess.

454
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There's like a miniature of the main village.

455
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Who's there? Yeah.

456
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't see like any movies. I was just talking about this the other day.

457
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I didn't see Captain America.

458
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I didn't see Green Lantern.

459
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I didn't see Green Hornet.

460
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Green Lantern was shit anyway.

461
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, but you are clearly a Marvel fan girl.

462
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
No. DC fans

463
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
have said that Green Lantern

464
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I heard it was terrible. I don't know.

465
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Look. Look.

466
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I know some of y'all don't want to hear it,

467
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
but I would gladly pay money to look at

468
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Ryan Reynolds for two hours, okay?

469
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But it's actually not him. It's a CG fake body.

470
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Now when Deadpool comes out...

471
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Imagination's all the same. Alright.

472
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Look. That's not what we're here to talk about.

473
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Other games I played this week. I did check out

474
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
the demo for one new title. I don't like

475
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
doing game reviews based on

476
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
a demo, but I will say it was

477
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
a great demo, and it did kind of sell me

478
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
on the game, and that was Bastion on Xbox

479
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Live, which is a new game that's out

480
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
for their Summer of Arcade.

481
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And I did spend a night the other night

482
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
just playing through that. It wasn't too

483
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
long. It was probably about 30 minutes to maybe

484
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
an hour tops. But kind of

485
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
the premise of it is it's very much like an

486
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
isometric sort of game.

487
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Made me think of... I don't know why when I first

488
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
started playing it, my mind went back

489
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
to like Solstice

490
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and Equinox, which is not a

491
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
bad thing, okay? I don't know if you know these games.

492
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Solstice was on the Nintendo, and Equinox

493
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
was a Sony ImagineSoft game.

494
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Sony logo on the

495
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Super Nintendo. And Equinox

496
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
is one of my favorite Super Nintendo

497
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
games they ever made. And a lot of that has to do

498
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
with the music. But anyway, it's that very isometric

499
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
kind of dungeon exploring thing.

500
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And I used to love those games.

501
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And so when I played Bastion

502
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
it kind of was that same thing. I was like, oh, this is kind of cool.

503
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But the art style is very different.

504
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The art style reminds me a little more of something like

505
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't know, Braid or something. But what I thought was really

506
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
neat about it is that the levels kind of appear

507
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
as you're walking. Very

508
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
interesting. And then of course most of all

509
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
the way the story is told is that

510
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
there's a narrator in the game

511
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
who sounds a lot like this.

512
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He's kind of a little bit of Isaac

513
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Hayes in his voice.

514
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And he's narrating the game.

515
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And he's talking about that the hero

516
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
just got up. And so then your character gets

517
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
up. And like you're walking down and you

518
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
fall, like let's say you're just clumsy and you fall off the

519
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
ledge. The hero falls to his

520
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
death and it's game over. And then

521
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
he'll fall back from the ceiling. Just

522
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
kidding. Just like

523
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
crazy things like that.

524
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sure that's the first

525
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
thing everybody's going to do when they play Bastion

526
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
is kind of like, oh my god, that

527
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
narrator has got to stop even though they

528
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
really enjoy it. So it's

529
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
cool. Yes,

530
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I played through the whole demo and I liked

531
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
you have different kinds of weapons.

532
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You have a hammer and a crossbow.

533
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Or you have a bow that you charge

534
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
like a singular bow.

535
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Or I think there was a magic type

536
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
weapon as well. But you can only really carry

537
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
three of the four. So you do have to kind of make some

538
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
decisions. And I just, I don't know, I thought that was

539
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
kind of neat. Just the whole

540
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
way it was designed. So I definitely think I will pick up

541
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the full version of that. It does seem to

542
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
be like there's, like I noticed right

543
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
when I got to the end of the demo in the main

544
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
world,

545
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
well not the main world, but like I guess

546
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
the Bastion square or whatever the central

547
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
square is that's supposed to be like the hub

548
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
that I guess the rest of the game takes place through.

549
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I noticed that there was a place where I

550
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
could put a shop

551
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
of one of two types. I could pick

552
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
one or the other. So it's kind of

553
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
like the choice on what you put there will

554
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
affect your game a little later. Unfortunately

555
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
the demo doesn't let you kind of fully

556
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
realize that out. But

557
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll have to tell you more about that when I pick up

558
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
the full game. So yeah,

559
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I thought that was kind of rad.

560
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So going to chat.orangelauntrader.com

561
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
to see if there's any feedback on the game

562
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
here. Zether says Bastion

563
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
needs to be on Steam. I think

564
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
it was an Ubisoft game. No,

565
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Warner Brothers. It's a Warner Brothers game. It might show up on

566
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Steam. You never know.

567
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Dark Tetsuya is asking, can you do the rest of the

568
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
show like that? No I can't.

569
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But maybe I'll do one of the

570
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
same. Maybe I'll read an email tonight in that

571
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
voice. Dark Soccer can pick an email and I'll do it.

572
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Okay. Alright. I'm just

573
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
kidding. I'm not going to do it.

574
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Let's see. Stop trying to

575
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
get out of reading emails.

576
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I think that's really it. Otherwise

577
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I've just been playing a lot of the other same stuff

578
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I've been playing. Like Beat Hazard. I tried

579
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
to play Survival Mode one night.

580
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I didn't get very far. I got through like a song and a half.

581
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And just playing some other

582
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
stuff on Steam. Bit.Trip and some of the other games

583
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I've talked about in previous weeks. Bastion's probably the

584
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
only new thing I've played. I have two games

585
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
at home sitting for my game rental service

586
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
waiting to play.

587
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And I just haven't gotten around to playing them.

588
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And that's Test Drive

589
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
2 and

590
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
one of the Need for Speed games. I don't even remember

591
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
which one. But hopefully

592
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I will have a racing-a-thon in the next few

593
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
days and I can talk about those games on next

594
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
week's show or something.

595
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll tell you what else too

596
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
is something I did this week is I went

597
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
to the mall because I was just wanting

598
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
to get out of the house going to the mall. And

599
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
we realized that we had a gift card that we wanted

600
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
to spend at GameStop. And

601
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I kind of felt a little dirty going to GameStop

602
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
because I have to tell you guys, I am currently

603
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
boycotting GameStop. And

604
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
you know, I'm not going to tell

605
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
anybody else what to do. And I realized

606
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
that there are people that might

607
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
be employees of GameStop and so forth

608
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
that listen to this show and I want you to know the boycott

609
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
does not have to do with any

610
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
type of like store employee.

611
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But the management of

612
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
GameStop is like doing things

613
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
to a friend of mine right now that

614
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I really don't agree with. And we're talking

615
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
like things of a legal nature

616
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
that just like disgust me.

617
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Like the way this person who worked for this

618
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
company with so much loyalty for so

619
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
many years really I think demonstrated

620
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and somebody who I think

621
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
almost in some ways

622
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
gave up opportunities elsewhere to go

623
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
work for this company.

624
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And just to see the way that they're being

625
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
treated now by this company

626
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
because of

627
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
other situations that happened just

628
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
it just disgusts me.

629
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Like I am disgusted by the actions

630
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
of GameStop and I can't say too much about

631
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
what's going on because there's a whole

632
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
legal element to it. Yeah I know

633
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I know but it's just

634
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
it's just infuriating and I refused

635
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
to give my dollars to a company

636
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
that's going to do that to people.

637
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Like it's it's gross

638
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and it's

639
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't know I'm not going to support it.

640
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Like I'm not going to support

641
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
this company

642
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't I don't I don't even know

643
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
how far I want to go with this. I got to be careful

644
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
what I say but I'm just I'm just I'm boycotting

645
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
GameStop. If there are

646
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I would encourage you

647
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
but I'm not going to tell you what to do. And I

648
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
realize we may have employees that listen to

649
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
the show and this is no fault

650
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
of like a store employee or anything like that.

651
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Like I realize people have to do

652
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
what they have to do especially in this economy to make a living

653
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
but I'm just going to say

654
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I hope

655
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
sometimes I really hope these rumors

656
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
are true that digital distribution may kill GameStop

657
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and that's again no offense

658
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
to those of you that work in the retail front.

659
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I hope you all find other jobs somewhere else

660
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
very soon. It won't because they bought

661
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
a digital distribution company. Well

662
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
that will hopefully fail miserably. That's

663
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
that's what I hope because the management

664
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and the uppers at GameStop clearly

665
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
are just assholes.

666
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't have and I have freedom of speech

667
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
freedom of press granted to me in the

668
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
U.S. Constitution. I can say in my humble

669
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
opinion GameStop management is

670
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
assholes and I am not going to support

671
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
a company run by assholes.

672
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's as simple as that.

673
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I will now step off my soapbox

674
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
la la la la la. But that was something that came

675
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
to mind this week. That's actually something that I

676
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
wanted to address like two weeks ago. But

677
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I think it was the same week as our ninth anniversary

678
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
show so I kind of never got into it. And now

679
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm not as ranty pants

680
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
as I probably would have been that week.

681
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So but I

682
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm feeling like I

683
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
needed to touch on that at some point. If you don't ever

684
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
hear me talk about that store again now you know why.

685
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Let's see. Unless it's bad news about

686
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
them. Well I

687
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I will continue to do my job of

688
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
reporting on them in

689
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
the most impartial way I possibly

690
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
can here on the show.

691
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You know whether the news is good or bad

692
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
we'll continue to report on it so you guys can

693
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
talk about it. But just don't expect me to be their

694
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
cheerleader. You know Dan's been like the recipient

695
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
of like three payouts from

696
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
class action lawsuits. Really.

697
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah. Really. Well

698
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I hope...

699
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Like a hundred bucks

700
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
you know nothing major but

701
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
there's been a number of them

702
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and a number still going on.

703
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Act Deft in Chat says was it the

704
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
planking thing? I read about

705
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
that where the GameStop employees got fired

706
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
for doing the planking. Believe it

707
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
or not. Now I can't believe

708
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm going to say this after my rant. Planking?

709
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Have you heard of this? Is that like that Pilates

710
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
move? Do you remember like in the 50's when people

711
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
used to sit on flag poles and that's what

712
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
was cool? Yeah. Ok what's cool now is to

713
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
put pictures on Twitter of yourself

714
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
lying dead in the most

715
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
strange places like in the middle of traffic

716
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
or what these GameStop employees

717
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
did. Do a

718
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
news.google search on

719
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
GameStop planking and a guy is lying

720
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
dead between two GameStop

721
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
displays like a plank. He was laying on

722
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
top of the displays. Yeah he's lying

723
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
on top of the displays and I got to

724
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
admit like even though I just chewed GameStop

725
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
out there that was

726
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
a real dumb thing to do is to be in

727
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
your GameStop uniform and take

728
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
a picture like that. I mean actually

729
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
in that case I kind of

730
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
think I know why GameStop fired. They do have a corporate image

731
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I think they're allowed to do that

732
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I gotta say. Otherwise

733
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
they're assholes. It's like the stewardess

734
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
that put pictures of herself you know on

735
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
the airplane you know and showing some

736
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
cleavage. Or the Disney employees at

737
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Euro Disney that were all in the costumes and

738
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
they were doing nasty things backstage

739
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
like don't put that shit

740
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
on the internet. Like

741
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
if you're gonna do it keep it on your phone and

742
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
laugh at a party or something. Don't put it on the

743
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
internet. That was the dumb thing they did. Keep in mind

744
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
my experience with planking has to do with

745
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
bodies.

746
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Oh here we go. Act F. See this is why

747
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I love having a live chat because chat will actually

748
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
link us to these things live.

749
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So there you go. I'm gonna bring

750
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
this up so you can see the picture here

751
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Dark Sakura. This is what

752
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I can't believe. Oh Spaznator

753
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
in chat tells me that flagpole sitting was in

754
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
the 1920s.

755
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Actually that was

756
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
um. I thought it was the 50s.

757
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
No. Okay then

758
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
swallowing goldfish or

759
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
this is actually kind of cool.

760
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Why you like that?

761
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I think that's ridiculous.

762
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Well I mean it is ridiculous but it's kind of

763
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
neat you know. That's some good

764
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
abdominal control. And as

765
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I've complained about. You are the most

766
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
unpredictable woman I've ever met. Okay.

767
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And that is saying a lot because most women are

768
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
unpredictable. This is

769
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
retarded. I'm sorry

770
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
stupid. I've been

771
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
told not to say retarded by my wife.

772
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You might have been retarded people.

773
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Well you should cut back on that

774
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
quite frankly.

775
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It is incredibly

776
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
stupid. I mean this

777
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
coning which is the new thing where you

778
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You're offending stupid people. Where you go through

779
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
the drive-thru order an ice cream cone and then

780
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
you grab the ice cream off the cone.

781
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Who cares? I would just think you're

782
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
stupid. Good job

783
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
man. Ah you're smart.

784
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Wait tell me that. What is coning?

785
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You get an ice cream cone

786
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and then someone else runs by and takes the ice cream off the cone.

787
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
No no no no no. Okay.

788
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Coning is where you go through the drive-thru

789
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
of a fast food place

790
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
you order an ice cream.

791
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
An ice cream cone that comes on a cone.

792
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Instead of like a normal person

793
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
grabbing it by the cone and enjoying your ice cream

794
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
you're a dumbass and you

795
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
grab it by the ice cream.

796
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And you shove it in your face.

797
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And that is coning. Or

798
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
yes. This is

799
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
what. These are the people

800
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
that will be voters someday.

801
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
They're not already. Thank you for

802
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
ruining the world. I thought

803
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I thought that was called fire in the hole.

804
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That's what people did. And that

805
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
like actually was not cool because like

806
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
somebody got burned over that whole thing. But like

807
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
the fire in the hole is where you go through the drive-thru and you

808
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
order like the combo meal and then you yell

809
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
fire in the hole and throw the soda

810
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
out through the window.

811
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But some some asshole

812
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
did it with coffee and like burned

813
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
some guy. That is actually not funny.

814
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Well of course it always takes stupider

815
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
people to you know ruin everything.

816
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And then there's a new thing called owling.

817
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I would demonstrate owling if

818
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
except I don't know if this chair would hold me.

819
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But owling is basically where you

820
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
kind of squat down on top

821
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
of something like you're a stupid owl.

822
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And you take a picture of it because you know

823
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
planking wasn't dumb enough.

824
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So the people have to

825
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
come up with even dumber things.

826
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I don't know.

827
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It's just stupid.

828
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
The internet makes people

829
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
stupid.

830
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
We have proof.

831
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So anyway

832
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I didn't mean to get

833
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
you're not supposed to

834
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
after I do a rant like that on GameStop

835
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
you're not supposed to give me a news article where I agree

836
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
with one of their crappy management decisions.

837
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
They also fired

838
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
the person that took the picture.

839
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I

840
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I think it's justified.

841
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I hate to say it but like you know

842
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
you're there to work not to do

843
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
fucking planking photos. Well I can't make my

844
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
fellow employee do his job if he wants

845
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
to go lay down on something.

846
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm taking the picture to expedite

847
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
this whole retarded

848
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
stupid thing that he is doing.

849
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Well okay but let me

850
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
put it this way. Let me put it this way.

851
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Let's say those employees

852
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
leave their position

853
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
at GameStop and go

854
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
plank somewhere else.

855
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And GameStop threatens to do things to them

856
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
because they've done things after the fact.

857
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That's kind of what's going

858
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
on in another situation right now and

859
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
that's why I think it's just

860
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
icky.

861
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So that's all I'm going to say.

862
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I feel better.

863
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Alright let's move on. Let's talk

864
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
about well we've done our gaming weeks.

Let's move on

871
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
and talk about some news

872
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and what's going on in the gaming industry this week.

873
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Let's see what else Pizzas' offer makes us happy.

874
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Oh I can't wait to see where we're going to

875
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
start tonight. What is

876
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
the internet talking about tonight?

877
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Let's talk about a wonderful

878
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
wonderful game that was

879
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
highly anticipated. Made by

880
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Capcom.

881
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Long awaited sequel to

882
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Mega Man Legends. Mega Man Legends 3

883
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
this project that they were also kind of

884
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
getting input from the fans

885
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
themselves to help them

886
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
create this game.

887
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
They said you know what?

888
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We're not going to put it up.

889
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Originally they were

890
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
going to have

891
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
this prototype version that was going to

892
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
hit the eShop

893
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and you're going to be able to download it.

894
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Then they started doing this crap like

895
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
well not a lot of people download

896
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
this game. We're not going to make it.

897
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Now they're like well there's not

898
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
enough systems that sold so

899
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
we're not going to make it.

900
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Basically the actual

901
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
quote

902
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
unfortunately it was

903
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
not felt that the Mega Man

904
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Legends 3 project met the

905
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
required criteria to go into

906
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
full productions and thus it was

907
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
pulled.

908
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Apparently they're saying there's

909
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
a fan campaign going on

910
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
now to get people to

911
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
put this game out. I have a few

912
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
problems with this. One, not to

913
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
be rude but that fan campaign will be about as

914
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
effective as the mother fan campaign.

915
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Sorry. Number

916
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
one, who told

917
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Capcom to fucking put it on 3DS

918
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
anyways? I mean that's risky.

919
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You're kind of assuming well it's a Nintendo

920
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
system. It's going to sell incredibly well.

921
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
What happens if it doesn't?

922
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
They're like what do you mean what happens if it doesn't?

923
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It's a Nintendo system. It's going to sell incredibly well.

924
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I mean that's kind of

925
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
their logic there. Then when it didn't they're like

926
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
crap.

927
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Um

928
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
but I don't understand

929
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
why they just don't put it out on

930
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
our system. I mean god it can't be that

931
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
hard to port a Playstation

932
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
1 looking game onto

933
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
another

934
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
system like Xbox Live Arcade,

935
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Playstation Network, WiiWare. Now you've

936
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
always been quite the fan of Mega Man Legends

937
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
haven't you? Because I remember

938
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
earlier episodes of this show and I mean like

939
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
early in the first few years of the show where you were talking about

940
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
how much you love those games and you always wish they

941
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
make a third one. So now here it is

942
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Capcom's going to make a third one and then oh well

943
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
you know what actually. And it was one of the reasons

944
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I got a 3DS.

945
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Granted not one of the top reasons I got

946
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
a 3DS.

947
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But at this point it'll take any reason to get

948
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
you know to justify

949
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
getting a 3DS because there's not many reasons

950
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
out there. But it's one of the things

951
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
it's seriously stupid because

952
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
this is one of the games oh yeah we're

953
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
the fans wanted this and we're going to

954
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
take all this fan support. Then they're like well

955
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
we didn't get a lot of support on this so

956
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
uh you know

957
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So they're going to give they're going to abort

958
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
they're going to have a live abortion of Mega

959
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Man and make all their fans watch. Yeah I love it.

960
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We didn't get enough support on the forums

961
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
for this you know

962
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
voting processing.

963
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm sorry but

964
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
you're the fucking game

965
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
developer why do you need people to

966
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
input on the game? Well we didn't get

967
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
enough input on the game so we don't know

968
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
what to do. Well what do you do in the situation

969
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
where you don't ask the fans what they

970
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
want you just I don't know

971
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
create the develop if you

972
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
will the game. The

973
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
crowdsourcing was not up to our expectation

974
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
so we fired all the employees

975
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
you. It was stupid

976
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
it's it's just Capcom

977
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
being Capcom now I'm sorry

978
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
but Capcom's kind of

979
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I don't know what they're doing. I

980
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
think some people higher up are making

981
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
really dumb decisions.

982
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Okay so let's go to comments from our chat

983
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
chat.org.com. Breakman says

984
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I think Legends 3 was cancelled because they wanted

985
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
to shove it in Inafune's face.

986
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Well the

987
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
creator of Mega Man left some time ago. Well that's

988
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
that's awesome yeah let's shove it in his

989
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
face that's

990
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
yeah that'll show the fans.

991
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I

992
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I don't see the point.

993
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Do you think there could be legit you know to play

994
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Devil's Advocate here a little bit could there be legitimate

995
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
concern on Capcom's part

996
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
that there just wouldn't be money to be made off

997
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
of this game. That maybe they're going to go through

998
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
all the trouble of developing it and the fact

999
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
that the 3DS has not quite

1000
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
sold millions and millions right now

1001
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and the fact that you know

1002
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Mega Man's Legends is a title

1003
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
that's many years old maybe it really

1004
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
wasn't destined to sell that many copies.

1005
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So therefore it's not worth doing.

1006
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
They've done more retarded

1007
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
things like they put out

1008
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
was it the Mega Man powered up Mega Man game

1009
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
on the PSP and

1010
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
the Mega Man I think there's a Mega Man

1011
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
X kind of remake thing

1012
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
on the PSP as well

1013
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
that I mean the PSP it

1014
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
didn't have that many people that bought it

1015
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and in a game like that especially

1016
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
where it's just a remake of the first Mega Man

1017
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
game not a lot of people really cared

1018
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
about that even though it was kind of cool they had a level

1019
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
editor and stuff like that it just didn't

1020
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
really strike me as

1021
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
something big like

1022
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
a sequel to

1023
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
a really cool franchise

1024
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
that people have been clamoring to get

1025
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
more of and obviously you know people

1026
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
love the characters because I mean you have

1027
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Tron Bon and

1028
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Marvel vs. Capcom 3

1029
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
and 2 and you know

1030
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
there's cameos from the

1031
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Servbot characters are everywhere

1032
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
like you know and Dead Rising

1033
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
and all that stuff and people love

1034
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and Tatsunoko

1035
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
vs. Capcom I mean

1036
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
they're definitely around there it's just

1037
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I don't know

1038
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
it's just kind of stupid

1039
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
there's some games you just put out to make

1040
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
the fans happy and granted you're not going to make

1041
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
a lot of money on it but

1042
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm sorry but when you're

1043
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
not really marketing this game

1044
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
you're not really

1045
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
needing the talent

1046
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
to come up with all this stuff since you're

1047
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
having fans kind of create everything

1048
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
for you I don't

1049
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
understand why

1050
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
why you would even have

1051
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
a big budget for this let me go to the

1052
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
chatroom and read some comments there's an

1053
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
interesting perspective here we have GameGuru in our

1054
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com says

1055
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
the problem with porting a game like

1056
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Mega Man Legends 3 to Xbox Live and PSN

1057
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
vs. the 3DS is because

1058
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Capcom could sell it for $40 on a

1059
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
physical medium vs. $15

1060
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
on a digital only medium

1061
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
TheRobD in our chatroom says reasons

1062
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
why Capcom probably cancelled Mega Man Legends

1063
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
3 not many people like

1064
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Mega Man Legends 1 and 2

1065
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Inafune left 3DS didn't sell

1066
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
well lack of fan demand

1067
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
pick any of those reasons all of them are valid

1068
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
that said with the fan support they were

1069
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
asking for they should have released the game

1070
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
who said that they couldn't put it on a physical medium

1071
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I mean they could have easily done that

1072
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and put it out as a disc sell it for $40

1073
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I mean people would have eaten it up

1074
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
oh yeah especially if they'd released it like

1075
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
as a budget title quote unquote where it was like

1076
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
$29.99 or it would have sold like crazy

1077
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I think and you could do

1078
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
download content later on because everyone's

1079
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
about download content but

1080
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Capcom just doesn't get it and I

1081
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
mean I know we're going to be talking about

1082
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
some other stuff from Capcom but

1083
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
let's look at what they're doing I mean

1084
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
here's their good ideas that they

1085
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
have coming out there's some

1086
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
new IPs from them so I'm

1087
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
not really commenting on those but

1088
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
the stuff that's existing

1089
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
like there's a Dead Rising 2

1090
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
off the record it was basically

1091
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Dead Rising 2 the way we should have done it in the first place

1092
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
because the last one didn't sell very well

1093
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I mean that's kind of dumb

1094
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
and then you have

1095
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Ultimate Marvel

1096
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
versus Capcom 3

1097
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
it's like well

1098
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
we were going to offer

1099
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
download content for the first game

1100
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
and we charged a buttload for a couple of them

1101
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and then we said

1102
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
fuck you you buy a disc now

1103
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
so

1104
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
and then

1105
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
all the stuff that they're doing on the

1106
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
IOS marketplace their crappy

1107
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
DRM I mean there's just a lot

1108
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
of really bad decisions

1109
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and we see this similar

1110
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
type of trend with other companies I mean

1111
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Activision for example

1112
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
um

1113
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
they just kind of have to have a reality

1114
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
check for a little bit oh and let's not

1115
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
forget to mention Devil May Cry

1116
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
how they're rebooting that franchise

1117
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and just I don't

1118
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
even know what they're doing to Dante it's just ridiculous

1119
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
could it maybe be that

1120
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
it's not so much the news that they've

1121
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
cancelled the project but it was kind of the way

1122
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
they delivered the news like

1123
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
part of me thinks especially seeing in our chat

1124
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
room that there are some people that are kind of sympathetic

1125
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
to why Capcom cancelled Mega Man Universe

1126
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Mega Man Legends 3

1127
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
actually there's another comment on Mega Man Universe

1128
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
don't forget that project was cancelled too

1129
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'll come back to that in a minute

1130
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
but see that's the point could it be

1131
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
the way they handled it like you know

1132
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Netflix took a lot of crap a couple weeks ago

1133
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
for the way they handled the news

1134
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
about the price increase to Netflix service

1135
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
could maybe Capcom have handled this

1136
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
a little better

1137
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
well I mean

1138
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
they could have done a few

1139
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
other things like saying well you know what

1140
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
we're going to explore

1141
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
other options with putting this game out

1142
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
the only thing that kind of

1143
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
rubs me the wrong way about this

1144
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
news was the whole remember they were supposed

1145
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
to release a prototype version

1146
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
that was going to be like a downloadable

1147
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
demo and gauging the reaction of

1148
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
that would be if they would release the full game or not

1149
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
but we never even got the prototype

1150
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
that strikes me as odd

1151
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
like that they talked about this whole

1152
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
well you better buy the prototype if you want the game

1153
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
essentially is what they're saying without saying it

1154
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
and now they've just canned the whole

1155
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
thing they're not even going to let the prototype come out

1156
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
that strikes me as very

1157
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
like just

1158
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I don't know like at least get the

1159
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
prototype version out and see what happens

1160
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
it was probably I'm guessing

1161
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
some sort of licensing thing maybe with

1162
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Inafune maybe it's just

1163
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
maybe that's why

1164
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Mega Man's not in Marvel vs. Capcom

1165
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
you know 3 or the new Marvel vs. Capcom

1166
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
3 update

1167
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
or whatever or

1168
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I don't know

1169
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I really

1170
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
when I heard it was cancelled I was like ehhhh

1171
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
whatever

1172
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I wasn't that

1173
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I thought it was cool but I wasn't

1174
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
super psyched I mean it would have been nice to have a

1175
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
game that I was kind of looking forward to on

1176
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
the 3DS but I've just kind of come to

1177
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
accept that the stuff on the 3DS

1178
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
there's just a lot of the stuff I was looking

1179
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
forward to and

1180
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
trust me there's been already 3 games

1181
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
cancelled on the 3DS including

1182
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Mega Man Legends 3 that I was

1183
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
looking forward to for the 3DS

1184
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Saints Row on the 3DS and

1185
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
DJ Hero on the 3DS all of those

1186
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
well DJ Hero is not surprising though considering what

1187
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
went on over there I understand that but these were all

1188
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
games you know that kind of sold me

1189
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
on a 3DS other than you know

1190
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Kid Icarus looks pretty awesome

1191
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I think Nintendo is going to recover a little bit

1192
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
come Christmas time though and I think some of these

1193
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
companies might regret it you know

1194
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I don't know but we'll see I want to read some other comments

1195
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
in chat because some of these are really good here

1196
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Sj100 Matt in our chat room says

1197
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
it's all a front since Kiji Inafune

1198
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
creator of Mega Man left Capcom

1199
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
they started cancelling Mega Man projects

1200
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
first Mega Man Universe which was a lot of fun

1201
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
when I played it at New York Comic Con

1202
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Mega Man Legends 3 and the lack of Mega Man

1203
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and Marvel vs. Capcom 3

1204
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Capcom obviously doesn't want Inafune's image

1205
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
as a part of them anymore

1206
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
well you can't say Mega Man

1207
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Universe was

1208
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
or the Mega Man Universe was completely omitted

1209
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
because Tronbon's a character and Servbots

1210
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
show up there but I also

1211
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I do I will admit I had a similar train of thought

1212
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
is that this whole stuff had me thinking

1213
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
as I thought about well gee they cancelled Mega Man

1214
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Universe 2 and now they cancel this and I thought

1215
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
how come we never got a Mega Man

1216
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
11 like didn't Mega Man

1217
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
9 obviously did crazy good

1218
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Mega Man 10 I think did alright but I think

1219
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
a lot of people were just like okay

1220
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
you know jokes jokes getting old now but like

1221
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm a little worried like does this mean Mega Man

1222
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
at all is

1223
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
done for now I mean I realize the creators left

1224
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Capcom so that's a very distinct possibility

1225
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
but it's a big deal we had Katamari games with other creators

1226
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
being there I mean it's

1227
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
none of them really were as good as the original

1228
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
well that's because they didn't try

1229
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
but you know the whole point is

1230
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
is it that they can't make any of these games

1231
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
or they're just not I mean cause

1232
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
if they're not I don't understand

1233
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I mean get over your guy themselves

1234
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
you know if you're just like well we don't want his

1235
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
character you know he left us

1236
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
we left us

1237
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
so sad I mean get over

1238
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
yourself Mega Man's an iconic

1239
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
character I would think I would be challenged to make

1240
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
the best Mega Man game we've ever made

1241
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
if you really if you really

1242
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
want to get at him make

1243
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
the best Mega Man game that anyone's ever seen

1244
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
we don't need you anymore

1245
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I mean but

1246
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
but they did they do need him

1247
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
that's essentially what they're admitting

1248
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
right?

1249
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I guess

1250
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
alright

1251
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
let's move on with some more gaming news

1252
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I suppose of course you can always join our chat room

1253
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

1254
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
where a lot of folks

1255
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
kind of going back and forth on this talking a little bit about

1256
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
the Twitter and how the announcement

1257
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
was handled there on Twitter I did not see this

1258
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
but I guess it was pretty harsh on the Europe

1259
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Twitter anyway

1260
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
yikes

1261
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
so more gaming news here this is a rumor

1262
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
that's been confirmed to be true

1263
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and it has to do with

1264
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Goldeneye Reloaded remember this

1265
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
we saw a listing for this on Amazon.com

1266
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
a couple weeks ago and it turns out

1267
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
it is true the Goldeneye remake

1268
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
is coming out on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation

1269
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
3 some screenshots were released

1270
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
earlier this week

1271
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
it is interesting because

1272
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
the game press release

1273
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
didn't even mention the Nintendo 64

1274
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
original or last year's

1275
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Wii game interesting

1276
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
but nevertheless the game is coming out

1277
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Daniel Craig is still playing

1278
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Bond not Pierce Brosnan

1279
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Activision says that the game will

1280
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
run at 60 frames a second it will

1281
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
support the PlayStation Move sharp shooter

1282
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
gun controller interesting

1283
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
so

1284
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
there you go it's also going to support 16

1285
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
players online the Wii version only

1286
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
supported 8 they're saying more maps

1287
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
weapons characters and game modes

1288
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
interesting

1289
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
so what do you guys think is this a game that interests you guys

1290
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I passed on the Wii version

1291
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
but I did play it at E3 and I thought it was okay

1292
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
it's just my Wii kind of collects dust now

1293
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
if they release this at the right price

1294
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I think I'd be interested

1295
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
but I just have a bad feeling it's

1296
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
going to be a $60 title and I just think there'll be

1297
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
too much other stuff this holiday I'm more

1298
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
interested in I concur that's

1299
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
really I think what our issue with that would be

1300
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
yeah it's going to be really be the price that this

1301
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
comes out and I'm not

1302
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
seeing your price here on the list so I guess

1303
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
we just have to assume it's probably going to be full price

1304
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
most likely

1305
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
just hopefully they're smart enough

1306
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
not to release it like a week before

1307
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Modern Warfare 3 comes out

1308
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
like the last

1309
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Bond game release dates

1310
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
are really crucial in gaming I think

1311
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
that's something we're kind of coming to learn over the past

1312
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
couple years I mean come on

1313
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Activision get your shit together

1314
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
you know that you have Modern Warfare 3

1315
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
coming out the week after you may

1316
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
think huh you know if we put this game

1317
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
out a week before we're only going to get

1318
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
maybe one week of sales because everyone's

1319
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
going to go oh my god you know

1320
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Modern Warfare 3 who gives a shit about

1321
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
buying this

1322
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
honestly this is a game this Goldeneye

1323
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Reloaded is a game that should be out now

1324
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
like it should have come out now because

1325
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
what do we have right now nothing

1326
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
right now nothing I mean

1327
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
yes I realize they want to you know get

1328
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
a lot of the Christmas sales and so forth

1329
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
but at the same time you got to be real

1330
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
you either look at why the one on the Wii didn't do

1331
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
you can't put that out this holiday

1332
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
because you've got you know let's

1333
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
let's start with the September

1334
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
you've got Gears 3 and Resistance 3 coming

1335
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
out you've got the

1336
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
following month Battlefield 3 coming out

1337
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
and then you have Modern Warfare 3

1338
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
it's just going to get lost

1339
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
you need to

1340
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
you know you need to really put that out either in August

1341
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
or you're going to have to wait until

1342
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
winter don't worry about

1343
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
getting it out for holiday because

1344
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
or put it out in December

1345
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
because there's nothing in December

1346
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
nothing

1347
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
DungeonBuster in our chatroom

1348
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
at chat.orangehonestgrady.com says

1349
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I already played the Wii version no need to play it again

1350
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
but 16 players

1351
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
online and new characters and new maps

1352
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
and HD OMG

1353
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
sign me up

1354
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
it would be really hard to ask somebody to pay

1355
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
60 bucks twice though because you know the Wii version

1356
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
or excuse me the Wii was probably only about 50 bucks

1357
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
but at this one's full price it'll be 60 bucks

1358
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
it's going to be hard to ask somebody to pay

1359
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
that twice especially for what

1360
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
was essentially a remake of an old game

1361
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'd rather see an HD remake of

1362
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
TimeSplitters 2

1363
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
and why that game?

1364
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
that game is awesome

1365
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
even TimeSplitters Future Perfect would be awesome

1366
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
it was such a great shooter

1367
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
alright

1368
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
well let's move on with some more news

1369
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Dark Soccer what do you have for us tonight?

1370
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
well we have some news about

1371
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Google Plus actually

1372
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
they have

1373
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
they're going to be getting some gaming features

1374
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
soon it's actually on the help page

1375
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
according to

1376
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
a few sources they say

1377
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
that they're going to do something called

1378
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
game stream where you can check

1379
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
for updates on the games that you're playing

1380
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and

1381
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
actually when it was on there

1382
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
the link to it now is a 404

1383
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
oh

1384
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
so

1385
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
but it said that there are

1386
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
something is in the source code

1387
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
that are games get game friends

1388
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
games get activities and games post

1389
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
to stream so

1390
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
hmm

1391
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
well I mean this isn't

1392
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I mean this is kind of a duh

1393
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
especially if you think about that we had

1394
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
news before that Google had invested

1395
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
in Zynga a couple months ago

1396
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
actually maybe more like six months ago

1397
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
they'd invested what like a hundred million dollars

1398
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
in Zynga so

1399
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I mean the fact that games are going to

1400
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
come to Google is a bit of a duh

1401
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
but you know a it's about how

1402
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
soon and I think the question that really has

1403
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
everyone wondering is how

1404
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
are they going to implement it because this could

1405
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
really make or break Google plus

1406
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
a lot of the a lot of folks are really

1407
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
excited about Google plus right now why

1408
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
because it's not Facebook and

1409
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
what Google plus is doing right is that

1410
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
they're giving people a lot of what

1411
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Facebook has been very slow

1412
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
or very stubborn to give and that is

1413
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
a decent mobile

1414
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
app for starters

1415
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
once

1416
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Apple finally approved it

1417
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
let's see they have given folks the

1418
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
control total control over well I shouldn't

1419
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
say total because there's some things about

1420
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
the privacy they even frustrate me too in the pictures

1421
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
department but like you have to have

1422
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
a public profile to keep your account

1423
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
as of the end of the month

1424
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
oh really yes actually as of the

1425
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
27th interesting I posted that on

1426
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Google plus oh I missed it but

1427
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
yeah they said if you're you're in a circle

1428
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
with people I don't read their stuff I'm kidding

1429
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I just missed it it can be

1430
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
as little as just your name yeah

1431
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
but you have to have a public profile

1432
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I think I well I thought you

1433
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
just kind of had one by default it's kind of like

1434
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Facebook you

1435
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
have a profile but as long

1436
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
as you know

1437
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
you lock everything down nobody sees

1438
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
anything but your name and your default picture

1439
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
which doesn't have to be you yeah I think

1440
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
that's it but I mean but they're saying that for people

1441
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
who have them fully private then

1442
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
their Google plus accounts are getting wiped

1443
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
no they wouldn't

1444
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
wipe that's what it says well wouldn't you just

1445
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
change it from private or something that seems

1446
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
a little ridiculous hold a second I will get it

1447
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
for you alright yeah share the story because I'm curious about

1448
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
that so then Google might damn

1449
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
themselves on all these you know hey we're gonna

1450
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
do privacy right and then oh

1451
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
well we're not that seems a little

1452
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
bit ridiculous to me I don't know here it is

1453
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
it says

1454
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and this is

1455
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
under the Google plus project

1456
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
area

1457
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
public profiles the purpose of Google

1458
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
profiles is to enable you to manage

1459
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
your online identity today nearly all

1460
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Google profiles are public we believe

1461
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
that using Google profiles to help people

1462
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
find and connect with you online is how the product

1463
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
is best used private profiles

1464
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
don't allow for this we have decided to require

1465
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
our what require all profiles to be

1466
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
public keep in mind that your

1467
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
full name is the only required information

1468
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
that will just be displayed in your profile

1469
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
you'll be able to edit or remove any other information

1470
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
you don't want to share if you currently

1471
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
have a private profile but you do not wish to

1472
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
make your profile public you can delete

1473
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
your profile or you can simply do nothing all

1474
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
private profiles will be deleted after July 31st

1475
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
2011 that doesn't seem any

1476
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
worse than what Facebook does I mean

1477
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
because yeah okay so you can have

1478
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
your name and a picture of your cat

1479
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I mean that's that doesn't seem

1480
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
so terrible to me

1481
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
but there are people that are getting

1482
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
kinda well

1483
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
because it's a step

1484
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
backwards for Google I think a little

1485
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
bit in the privacy area where everybody's

1486
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
been really I think I think it

1487
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
kinda feels a little bit like a slap

1488
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
or a step back when everybody's been very

1489
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
rah rah rah circles are the right thing

1490
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
to do circles are amazing it's

1491
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
the whole reason why Google Plus works

1492
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
circles are this year's squares

1493
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
yes circles are this year's squares

1494
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
exactly so as far as

1495
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
going back to the games implementation though

1496
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I think a lot of people are nervous about how are they gonna

1497
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
implement games because one reason that people

1498
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
hate Facebook is that they hate

1499
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
the so and so is growing

1500
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
bullshit on their farm why don't you come

1501
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
farm with them and all the

1502
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
invites one thing and also on

1503
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Facebook they have at least didn't do hide

1504
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
all posts by yeah and Facebook

1505
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I will say a lot of that got better

1506
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
but it took a long time for that to happen

1507
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
and so the question is how's Google gonna

1508
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
implement it especially if they have a stake in Zynga

1509
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
now based off of the stuff that's leaked

1510
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
out it sounds like a

1511
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
game play stream will be

1512
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
a totally separate thing that

1513
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
you would have to click on to view

1514
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
just the game post and I think that's

1515
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
a great way to do it that way

1516
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
it keeps it out of my main feed where people are

1517
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
posting cute pictures of their cat and

1518
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
status updates and it just puts it in

1519
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
a place where if I feel like playing a game

1520
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
then I'll click on that stream and see what's

1521
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
going on but I don't always

1522
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
believe it or not I don't always feel like playing a game

1523
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
when I go online

1524
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and believe it or not I don't always care what other people are playing

1525
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
yeah exactly especially

1526
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
my mother in Farmville

1527
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
believe it or not everybody that sends me an invite for a game

1528
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I deny it

1529
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
oh and all those people, I wish that

1530
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
this is one thing I wish Facebook had

1531
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
to have an option where

1532
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
send everyone who sends you an

1533
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
invite a message saying knock it off

1534
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
and

1535
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
another interesting comment from BlackWolf

1536
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
in our chatroom and this is something I have thought

1537
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
about before so I guess I'll address it now

1538
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
BlackWolf says Skye one other thing to realize

1539
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
is that they insist on you using your real

1540
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
name if you use a pseudonym

1541
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
i.e. you and me we are at risk of

1542
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
being suspended from Google Plus

1543
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and to get unsuspended you would need to send them a photocopy

1544
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
of your government issued ID

1545
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
well here's the thing I think most of the reason

1546
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
why they're doing that is they're trying to keep the

1547
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
businesses out of profiles right now

1548
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and that you know my name on there isn't

1549
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
fuck you you know like if my name

1550
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
was Rob fuck you I think they might have

1551
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
a problem with that I think the way

1552
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I'm doing it on there and the way you're doing it on there

1553
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
we're kind of okay because we're just

1554
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
you know we're people that are just trying to protect our

1555
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
privacy because I think you know

1556
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
podcasters can be in a very unique situation

1557
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
sometimes and I've talked about

1558
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
violations that have happened to my privacy before

1559
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
and how alarming that can be I don't

1560
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
want to get into that whole spiel before but it's scary

1561
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
until you've been there so here's my thing

1562
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
if Google Plus cancels my account fine I'll

1563
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
stop using it I'm not going to sign

1564
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
up under my real name period but my life

1565
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
will go on without a Google Plus

1566
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I won't talk about it on this show

1567
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'll make my friends go to another website

1568
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
if they want to see my pictures and give another company

1569
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
the ad dollars or what have you

1570
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
like I am not required

1571
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
to use this website I think

1572
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
it's pretty cool and I'd like to keep

1573
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
using it but there's just

1574
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
some things I'm not going to bend on

1575
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
you know and if they're and what

1576
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
would infuriate me is if

1577
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Lady Gaga gets a profile on Google Plus

1578
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that will infuriate me if

1579
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Lady Gaga gets to have a profile

1580
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
and I would get mine removed

1581
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
because I have to use a fake last name to

1582
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
protect myself from stalkers

1583
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
then that would piss me off

1584
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
because that's a double standard

1585
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
how come Lady Gaga gets to have a Google Plus

1586
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
profile and not Stephanie Germanotta

1587
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
that would piss me off

1588
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
absolutely it would piss me off or any other

1589
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
celebrity that doesn't go by their real name which is

1590
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
most of them

1591
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Cher's name isn't Cher you guys

1592
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Madonna's name actually I think

1593
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Katy Perry isn't even Katy Perry

1594
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Katy Perry is not Katy Perry look at actors

1595
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
like David Tennant couldn't register

1596
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
under his real name because

1597
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
there was another actor with that name registered with

1598
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
the Actors Guild in the

1599
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
UK the greatest

1600
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
rock star singer of all fucking

1601
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
time no

1602
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Freddie Mercury was not his real

1603
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
name either well Ringo Starr wasn't his name

1604
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
but he had illegally changed so

1605
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
there you go

1606
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I like how someone in chat changed their name

1607
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
to Rob Fuck You

1608
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Dungeon Buster in our chatroom

1609
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
at chat.org.com says

1610
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Rob Fuck You from fucking Austria

1611
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
you know what I would

1612
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
like is if you

1613
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
have to register under your real name but you

1614
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
can choose a pseudonym

1615
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
but it has to track that that would be great

1616
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
that would be great

1617
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
and Rama in chat says Skye but what if she

1618
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
legally changes her name to Lady Gaga

1619
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
she hasn't

1620
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
she hasn't and you know if you watch interviews

1621
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
with her which I wouldn't expect that all the listeners

1622
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
of this show have watched Gaga

1623
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
interviews but me being a little screaming fanboy

1624
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
of Gaga I have watched interviews and she

1625
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
she claims and I believe it

1626
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I don't see why not that there really is no difference

1627
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
between her and Stephanie it's just kind of

1628
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
who she that's the name that people

1629
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
know her by which funny enough is kind of

1630
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
what Rob Roberts has become for me

1631
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
most people I meet don't realize

1632
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I have a different last name but I have

1633
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
to use a different last name on the radio

1634
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
to protect the things I do from 8 to 5

1635
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Monday through Friday I'm sorry but

1636
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I'm not sharing the details of my job

1637
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and my life and how I pay my

1638
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
rent and eat because guess

1639
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
what this show doesn't do that

1640
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
nor any podcast that you listen to

1641
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
unless it's maybe Adam Carolla

1642
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
podcast will not feed somebody

1643
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
if someone gives me a job in exchange for

1644
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
me having to blog about it then I would do

1645
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
that yeah if you want to pay me

1646
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
six digits a year to do this

1647
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
show or you want us to start charging a

1648
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
subscription fees that we start making six digits

1649
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
a year off this show which I still wouldn't think would happen

1650
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
then I'll happily use my

1651
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
real last name

1652
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
but that's you know

1653
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
that's where it's at

1654
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
alright anyhow I didn't mean this to turn into

1655
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
like a stalker privacy conversation

1656
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
but yeah games on Google Plus will you

1657
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
play games on Google Plus let me

1658
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
ask that I would I would think if

1659
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Google has a hundred million dollars stake

1660
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
in Zynga I think Zynga has

1661
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
a hot new game that they're going to have

1662
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
exclusive on Google Plus and I'm talking like

1663
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Farmville 2 will be

1664
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
like a big land for Google Plus

1665
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
which is going to make a lot of people eye roll

1666
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
but if they launch it the right

1667
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
way it won't piss everybody off

1668
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
if they if they

1669
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
make it so that it's not in your face

1670
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
people will be fine but this could make or

1671
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
break Google Plus if it's if it's all

1672
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
over and it's Facebook all over again

1673
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
people will just go right back to Facebook

1674
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
because they have their network built up there

1675
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
because you know with Apple

1676
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
going with big integration with

1677
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Twitter and I'm

1678
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
assuming at some point maybe like Facebook or something

1679
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
like that you know the Android

1680
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
iOS or Android

1681
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
OS I guess is going

1682
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
with Google Plus

1683
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
since it's a Google based

1684
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
operating system it makes sense

1685
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
yeah

1686
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
it has the phrase on here

1687
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
if you're looking for updates shared from games

1688
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
check out your game stream

1689
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
so let's hope it's all

1690
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
hidden in there that would be great

1691
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
because I wouldn't mind playing Who Wants to be a Millionaire on Google

1692
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
that would be kind of fun actually

1693
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
well the whole reason I stopped playing

1694
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
a lot of those stuffs and that's actually why I haven't signed up for

1695
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Turntable yet is because

1696
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Turntable requires you to link through

1697
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
your Facebook and I don't like

1698
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
all those apps associated with my Facebook

1699
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
but the good news is I don't use my real

1700
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
name on Facebook either I'm like

1701
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
hey it's alright well see I

1702
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
use my real name but I also use it as a

1703
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
networking tool right right and

1704
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
actually I have it to where the only people

1705
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
who can find me are people I've invited

1706
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
so

1707
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I don't want to I've seen a lot of people who

1708
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
signed up for things that I might have been interested in

1709
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
later on it uses it'll

1710
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
tag them as a way

1711
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
to advertise their stuff because the tag will show

1712
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
up on your friends feed right

1713
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
and I don't want to be used for something that

1714
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
they're not paying me for right

1715
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I gotta say though I

1716
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
chose to go ahead and go into Turntable

1717
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
FM and I gotta say that is a

1718
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
rad it's way better than Spotify

1719
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Turntable FM is awesome

1720
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
well I also read something about the

1721
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
legalities that how they're getting away with it

1722
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
yeah yeah somebody post that to my wall

1723
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
if you haven't seen Turntable FM

1724
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
how can I explain Turntable FM real quick

1725
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
it's basically like you and your friends get to

1726
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
play DJ and you

1727
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
can't go in a room by yourself that's an

1728
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
important thing to know you can but you can't do

1729
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
anything once a friend signs up and it's you

1730
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
and a friend you can set a queue of songs

1731
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
to play and it'll basically go down

1732
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
the line of up to five DJ's

1733
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
and play the next song on your playlist

1734
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
and it sounds so simple

1735
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
but the great thing about it

1736
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
this is me signing up for it are you really doing it?

1737
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
sure why not after that whole thing

1738
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
you just said? well yeah

1739
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
liar no I'm not a liar but

1740
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
that's why I'm not doing the games

1741
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
no I know you can always and you can always go

1742
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
revoke its permissions at any time that's the other thing

1743
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
which I spent like an hour doing

1744
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
because the stupid quizzes count as apps

1745
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
oh yeah oh yeah so no one's in

1746
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
right now so you would be going into random rooms

1747
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
but like if any of your friends were DJ'ing their little

1748
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
pictures would show up on the right hand side

1749
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
and you go into rooms and it just goes down the line

1750
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
and up to five people just it goes

1751
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
in their playlist and it sounds so simple

1752
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
ooh they're playing Fuel I'm going to the 90's

1753
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
mix it's an awesome way to discover new music

1754
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
it is an awesome way to discover new music

1755
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
like me and a couple of my wow guildies

1756
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
were in there the other night just playing

1757
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
random music that we like and it was

1758
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
it was cool I just hey have you guys

1759
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
heard this song? and it comes up next

1760
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
and yeah the legalities highly questionable

1761
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
this website probably won't be around in a year

1762
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
but I'm going to enjoy it while I can

1763
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
there you go

1764
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
alright uh let's

1765
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
move on god we keep bringing up stories

1766
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and then it like just turns into something else completely

1767
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
there it's on there and everyone has to

1768
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
put up with my music

1769
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
orange tangent radio you know what

1770
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
after the show everyone in my room

1771
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
you should name your room

1772
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
pillow fight dark soccer is pillow fight

1773
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
well but the thing is dark soccer you'd have to

1774
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
you can't the way

1775
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
that's set up and the way they do that legality

1776
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
you can't

1777
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
be the sole DJ

1778
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
you have to be DJing with at least one

1779
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
other person well I did make a room called dark soccer

1780
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
is pillow fight alright so go on turntable

1781
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
FM right now and look for it I'm not going to post any music

1782
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
yet oh yeah I was going to say don't play music right now

1783
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
we're trying to do a show but I've got the room made

1784
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
alright

1785
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
um okay so let's talk

1786
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Sony here I guess the next

1787
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
uh what is going to be

1788
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
the next big thing from Sony obviously right now their

1789
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
big push is 3D and

1790
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
maybe it's going to be the next evolution of 3D

1791
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
right now apparently according to

1792
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
um an interview with develop

1793
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
uh magazine

1794
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
uh Sony London Studios chief

1795
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Mick Hawking is

1796
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
talking about some head mounted

1797
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
3D displays that they've been showing off

1798
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
at CES and

1799
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
uh they're saying that we're working with a couple games at

1800
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Sony that are experimenting with

1801
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
virtual reality type experiences

1802
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
and uh

1803
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
basically saying that VR could make

1804
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
a comeback and definitely

1805
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
you know I think

1806
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
yeah maybe a little bit

1807
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
it could because

1808
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
you know remember back in the day

1809
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
graphics on PC's not

1810
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
that great I mean if anyone's seen

1811
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
lawnmower man ewwww

1812
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
that's pretty basic stuff I saw it in the theater

1813
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
some of those virtual reality demos

1814
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
back in like 95 and stuff were

1815
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
hilarious I distinctly remember

1816
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
one to this day where you could

1817
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
either be a dude walking down the street

1818
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
or like in the car and it was

1819
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
like virtual reality you could walk

1820
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
up to these homes that were just giant blocks

1821
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
like but it was awesome the whole

1822
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
thing looked like um hard driving

1823
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
yeah it seriously

1824
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
was that basic and nowadays

1825
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I mean you know and who knows when this

1826
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
kind of technology will be coming out

1827
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
just technology keeps getting way

1828
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
better and better each year just exponentially

1829
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
and I mean very well

1830
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
in 10 years we could be seeing some sort of

1831
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
3D virtual

1832
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
reality technology being the kind of

1833
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
standard for gaming and stuff

1834
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
it's definitely within the realm

1835
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
of possibility I suppose

1836
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
and I could definitely see Sony kind of

1837
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
this could definitely certainly maybe

1838
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
happen it's definitely

1839
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
possible it is a

1840
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
distinct absolute

1841
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
possibility

1842
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
there is a chance

1843
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
out there that something like this may

1844
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
or may not happen

1845
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
ah

1846
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
nice

1847
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
alright

1848
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
so

1849
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
moving on I guess I don't know

1850
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
what Sony virtual reality stuff could they

1851
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
really make that would be that awesome

1852
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
well they could

1853
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
really

1854
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
enhance home

1855
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
okay with some virtual reality technology

1856
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
too I don't know allow more members in your

1857
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
clubs

1858
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
alright

1859
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I'm trying to

1860
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I'm thinking back to there was a peripheral

1861
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
back in the Super Nintendo

1862
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
days that were just basically goggles

1863
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
you could put on your face that were just

1864
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
televisions literally right in front of your face

1865
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
and they called it a virtual reality headset

1866
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
for games like on the Super Nintendo

1867
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
you know Faceball 2000

1868
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I played at one time

1869
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
a virtual we played a couple of virtual

1870
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
reality games well it wasn't even

1871
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
really virtual reality it was basically yes

1872
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
monitor on my eyes type

1873
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
thing but

1874
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
it was at Santa Cruz on the

1875
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
beach boardwalk they had a thing

1876
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
that you could do and you could either play Quake

1877
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
or Duke Nukem 3D

1878
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
man

1879
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
awesome it was pretty awesome

1880
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
alright moving

1881
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
there's go ahead

1882
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I hate getting on all these tangents there's

1883
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
something that they have at the boardwalk it's called being on

1884
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Orange Long's Radio I know I know there's something that they

1885
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
have on the boardwalk now it's called

1886
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
like Safe Crackers not

1887
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
not Safe Cracker it's like

1888
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
some sort of like heist game

1889
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
where you have to you go in a room

1890
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
and you have to dodge lasers kind of like

1891
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
you know so you're Catherine Zeta Jones

1892
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
yes exactly basically

1893
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
you're doing that and

1894
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
it's a game or you're that scene out of

1895
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Resident Evil

1896
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
yeah it's very similar to that

1897
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
but it's a game that you play

1898
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
at the Santa Cruz I thought that was kind of cool

1899
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
because I hadn't seen that before

1900
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
my friend posted it on her Facebook

1901
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
that's at the beach boardwalk

1902
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
we need to do an OLR from the Santa Cruz

1903
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
boardwalk I think that would be fun

1904
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
we need to go Dark Sakura

1905
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
don't you want to be like Catherine Zeta Jones and be in the

1906
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
the laser like making sure

1907
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
that the lasers don't hit your boobies

1908
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I'll go look at it

1909
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
real quick and figure out what that was called

1910
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I'm sorry the moment you said her name I started thinking of

1911
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Dawn French impersonating her

1912
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
really I think of T-Mobile commercials

1913
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
have you ever seen

1914
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
the French Insolence Show?

1915
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
yes because you've played it for me like a million times

1916
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
yes

1917
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Catherine Zeta Spartacus Douglas Jones

1918
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
anyhow

1919
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
no he's not my grandfather he's my husband

1920
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
anyhow yes we need to do a Santa Cruz

1921
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
boardwalk show that would be a lot of fun

1922
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
anyhow moving on

1923
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
talking about the Wii U

1924
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
yes it seems like there's new Wii U news every week

1925
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
and it's somebody reacting to it

1926
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
this week it's Ubisoft is reacting to the Wii U

1927
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
they must like it because it's

1928
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
the whole console has a capital U just like their company

1929
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
well they said

1930
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Yves Guillemot

1931
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
who is the Ubisoft CEO says

1932
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
we feel this

1933
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
console is coming with very innovative features

1934
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
that will change the video game industry

1935
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
and we want to be a part of that

1936
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I love that you have a screen very close to you

1937
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
you can get information and send it as well

1938
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
but you don't have to learn

1939
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
too many things

1940
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I think it's sending the message that the new transition

1941
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
is going to happen and we're going to have new machines

1942
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
coming soon

1943
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
that almost seems like a bad

1944
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
translation to me

1945
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
you get information and send it but you don't have to learn

1946
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
too many things

1947
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
well anyhow

1948
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
speaking of Ubisoft there's been some

1949
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
clarification if you will on Assassin's Creed

1950
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
it is not a port

1951
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
of Revelations

1952
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
the game that is coming to the Wii U is an all new

1953
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Assassin's Creed title

1954
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
it was part of the little Nintendo announcement

1955
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
they showed a clip of Assassin's Creed

1956
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
but it's actually going to be an all

1957
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
new title

1958
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
that was clarified in the interview

1959
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
so it's something new

1960
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
who knows

1961
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
could be Assassin's Creed 3

1962
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
we'll see

1963
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
but you'll have that

1964
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
screen and you might be able to

1965
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
keep some information secret

1966
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
ok

1967
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
sorry to go back to what I was

1968
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
talking about before

1969
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
it's a game called The Vault

1970
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
and they have

1971
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
a little bit of gameplay

1972
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
that they're showing that's on TV

1973
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
in the lobby or whatever but you have to

1974
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
have these lights shining through and you have to dodge them

1975
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
and they get to where the vault is in the back

1976
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
it looks like fun

1977
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
and they play, you can't hear it

1978
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
but they have the Mission Impossible music playing

1979
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
that actually looks kind of rad

1980
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I'm not even going to lie, I kind of want to play that

1981
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
but my fat ass would hit so many lasers

1982
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
your gigantic

1983
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
ass just set off five lasers

1984
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
congratulations

1985
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
moving on, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us

1986
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
before we get to release dates after this

1987
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
well how about the

1988
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
roster for Marvel vs. Capcom

1989
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

1990
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
how's that sound?

1991
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
it got leaked and Capcom's not denying it

1992
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
so for Capcom we have Strider Here You

1993
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Firebrand, Vergil

1994
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Frank West, Phoenix Wright and Nemesis

1995
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
OBJECTION

1996
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
STARS

1997
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
actually that is going to be reason alone

1998
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Firebrand, to get the game and that's pretty awesome

1999
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
that Strider is coming back

2000
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Firebrand, that's awesome

2001
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
that was also a bad guy in Ghost of the Goblins

2002
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
but he had his own two series of games

2003
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
that's right, what about Marvel

2004
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Marvel we have Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange

2005
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Nova, Rocket Raccoon

2006
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Hawkeye, yes

2007
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
and Iron Fist, yes

2008
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
two of my favorite characters on the Marvel side

2009
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I'm happy and my favorite character

2010
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
on the Capcom side, I'm happy

2011
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
cause

2012
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
well you know back in the day, Dan had

2013
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
a website

2014
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
called Neo Strider Strider Zone

2015
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
he had

2016
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
like old style like

2017
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Geo Cities type old web page

2018
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
and I did all the graphics for it back in the day

2019
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
oh wow, when we first got together

2020
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and

2021
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
so

2022
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
we actually

2023
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
he totally got me into the Strider games

2024
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
but now I'm a big fan

2025
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
of the

2026
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
mostly A list but not quite A list

2027
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
the pushing B plus list

2028
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
of Marvel heroes

2029
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
so like my favorite character of all time is Jessica Jones

2030
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
which I know she's not gonna end up in a game but

2031
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I can dream, but now I finally

2032
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
get Hawkeye in a game

2033
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
that isn't Captain America and the Avengers

2034
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
and Iron Fist

2035
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
who, Iron Fist in a fighting game just makes

2036
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
sense, awesome

2037
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
what do you think though about

2038
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
the whole fact that they're putting out this ultimate

2039
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Marvel vs Capcom 3 like not even

2040
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
a year after the first game came out I mean

2041
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
isn't that kinda

2042
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
the game needed tweaking, it needed tweaking

2043
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
it needed free tweaking

2044
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
you know what I mean?

2045
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
like it just, I mean

2046
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
you have to admit, this is why

2047
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
people are pissed at Capcom right now about the whole

2048
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Mega Man Legends 3 thing is that you know you get

2049
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
this slap in the face and then you get this slap

2050
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
in the face, I don't care I don't think it's a slap in the face

2051
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I'm excited, it's a slap in the face if

2052
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
you bought the original, I did buy the original and I

2053
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
don't care I want this one too, really?

2054
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
yeah, I mean I don't know, Hawkeye

2055
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I will say this, I bought Street Fighter 4

2056
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
on Xbox 360 and then Super Street Fighter 4

2057
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
is announced I'm like

2058
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
alright well I'll get it on Playstation 3 cause at least

2059
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I know it'll have a better controller

2060
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
and then, yeah and then the

2061
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
arcade edition comes out so like another 15 bucks

2062
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
but at least that wasn't like a

2063
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
like a full, I mean I know it was a

2064
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
full retail release but at least

2065
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
it was compatible with Super Street Fighter

2066
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
well they had, they had a DLC that

2067
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
you could get that basically made it

2068
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
to where, tournament stick, yeah

2069
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
it was, worth the money

2070
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
they should have done that type of stuff with

2071
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Marvel vs Capcom 3 except

2072
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
they decided hey you know we're gonna be assholes

2073
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
and we're gonna put out each character for $5 each

2074
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
um

2075
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
no, well they only had two of them

2076
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
this is actually, none of the

2077
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
other characters are gonna be available as DLC

2078
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
they've got Shumagrath and Jill included with

2079
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
this one and then all of the rest of the characters

2080
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
that I named

2081
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I think I saw something come out of

2082
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Comic Con about other

2083
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
downloadable characters for the game though

2084
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
they have costumes

2085
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
alternate costumes

2086
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I thought there were other characters that showed up at the

2087
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Comic Con that were like download

2088
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
content or something like that, could be wrong

2089
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
well they've also added a spectator mode

2090
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
and other new playable content

2091
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
so basically they said

2092
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
and this is a quote here from

2093
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Nitsuma said that

2094
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
there's about half and half between the original

2095
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
download content, the planned download content

2096
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
and the new content

2097
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
so basically it's like you're getting

2098
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
well

2099
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I would look at it as

2100
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
almost a new game

2101
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
like half a new game

2102
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
with everything else that's going

2103
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
into it and honestly that's how I'm looking at it

2104
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I mean you're getting as many new characters

2105
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
as a new fighting game

2106
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
so I guess that's true

2107
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
at least it's down to 40 bucks too

2108
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
so those of us who didn't buy the game the first time

2109
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
like me, now have a reason to

2110
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I look at it like a sort of Rock Band 3

2111
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
you know

2112
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
your old characters carry over

2113
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
and you get some new ones, and new content

2114
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
new modes

2115
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
with Rock Band 3, all your

2116
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
songs carry over, and you get

2117
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
symbols, and new modes, and

2118
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
harmony, and most importantly the keyboards

2119
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
and keyboard, you get keyboard cap

2120
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
yeah but I wouldn't exactly say it's

2121
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
very similar to that because

2122
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
why not it's exactly the same

2123
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
why not because the original game is broken

2124
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
they have issues that they need to fix

2125
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
for the online multiplayer, and they're just like

2126
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
eh, we don't want to do that, we're just going to release a new game

2127
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Rock Band's got issues online

2128
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
ok, but nothing to the point

2129
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
that it's game breaking

2130
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I mean, it's just

2131
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I don't play online so I don't give a shit

2132
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
they refuse to fix it, so they're just like

2133
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
oh hey, but by the way, you should buy our new game

2134
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
which very well can have problems of its own

2135
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
fix it because they're going to release ultimate

2136
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I don't play online, so I honestly personally

2137
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I don't give a shit about the online play

2138
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
well you may not give a shit, but there's a lot of people who do play online

2139
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
and that's a big thing for them, and they do give a shit

2140
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
then it's their problem

2141
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I have no problem with it

2142
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I believe it's gaffcom's problem

2143
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
just a quick note for the live listeners only

2144
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I don't know what happened, but Winamp crashed

2145
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
so unfortunately you missed that little argument

2146
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
so you'll have to tune into the podcast to hear that

2147
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Loki and Dark Soccer just got in a little heated

2148
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
discussion about that

2149
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Loki was having an uncharacteristic

2150
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
caring for other people

2151
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
and I didn't give a shit

2152
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
it's not uncharacteristic for me

2153
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I care about other people

2154
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
me, myself, and I

2155
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
no, I'm just saying

2156
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
the whole reason I understand

2157
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
expanding and adding new features

2158
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I think the last game I played online was Fable 2

2159
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
on Xbox Live

2160
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
ok, well then this stuff doesn't bother you

2161
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
that's fine

2162
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
but for people that do play online

2163
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
and I guess I don't play this game online

2164
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
but I empathize with those that do

2165
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
they may be a little bit pissed at the fact that

2166
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
instead of patching the game

2167
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
to make it work like it's supposed to

2168
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I'm sure there's going to be a patch

2169
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
no, there will not be a patch

2170
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
if they're going to announce a new game

2171
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
why would they fix the old game

2172
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I agree, the old game is done

2173
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
now that they've announced this

2174
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
there's nothing going to come of the old game

2175
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
and back to this, it's not Capcom's fucking problem

2176
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
people are going to pay for the game

2177
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
they're going to sell it

2178
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
because people love Marvel vs. Capcom 3

2179
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
and I love Hawkeye

2180
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
so I'm getting the game

2181
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I have to say your Rock Band comparison

2182
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
makes a lot of sense

2183
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I still don't know

2184
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
if I would really be happy that it's all happening

2185
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
in the same year

2186
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
but that was probably the best

2187
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
argument I've heard for Capcom

2188
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I can get why people are

2189
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
messed up over it

2190
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
but at the same time

2191
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
they're going to make their money

2192
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
it's not Capcom's problem

2193
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
it's the consumer's problem

2194
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
and the only way it's going to be made

2195
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
is if the consumer does not follow through

2196
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
you're right, this isn't Capcom's problem

2197
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
it wasn't Activision's problem

2198
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
that DJ Hero 1 didn't have any download content

2199
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
because they decided

2200
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
instead of supporting it with download content

2201
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
like we said we were

2202
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
we're just going to, I don't know, put out a new game

2203
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
so Loki, there were like 9 songs

2204
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
you could download for DJ Hero 1

2205
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
so, I mean, that was

2206
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
9 pieces of download content

2207
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
that you could get

2208
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
or Konami and Dance Dance Revolution

2209
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
you know, oh yeah

2210
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
we're going to support this game

2211
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I know we said we're going to support the last game

2212
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
with download content, but I promise you

2213
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
we're going to support this game with download content

2214
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
and here's your

2215
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
one piece of download content

2216
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
you know, it's just like that

2217
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
and you may remember what happened

2218
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
to Guitar Hero where there wasn't as much

2219
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
download content, but hey, you know what, we released

2220
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
these song packs, because that's what the fans

2221
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
want, they want all their characters

2222
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
and all this cool spectator mode

2223
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
and alternate stuff, because you know what

2224
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I really need an Elvis costume

2225
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
for my fucking characters

2226
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
that's really canon for

2227
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Marvel, that's going to be really awesome

2228
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
so

2229
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
looking forward to it

2230
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
oh, and by the way

2231
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
not to nitpick here a little bit

2232
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Capcom, but

2233
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
your game, Street Fighter

2234
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
versus Tekken, or Street Fighter

2235
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
across Tekken, I know that you've added

2236
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
other Capcom characters, they're not

2237
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
part of Street Fighter, you need to change the fucking title

2238
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
hey hey hey, I'm not to that story yet, you need to wait

2239
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
you just sit and hold that rant

2240
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
alright, we gotta go to some release dates

2241
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
travel around the world

2242
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
and talk about what's coming out to a store near you

2243
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Loki, start here in the US

2244
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
there's not much of anything coming out this week

2245
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
it's pretty much

2246
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Catherine

2247
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
that's on PlayStation 3 and

2248
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Xbox 360, and of course

2249
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
they have the Love Is

2250
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Something

2251
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
some collector's edition that

2252
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Love Is Something

2253
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
how about Love Is Over?

2254
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
yeah, Love Is Over

2255
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
you can get that collector's edition that comes with

2256
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
boxers and a t-shirt

2257
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
that's pretty awesome

2258
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
and then of course Pac-Man and Galaga

2259
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
legions

2260
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
how would they know what size boxers to put in there

2261
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
there's only large

2262
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
some Catherine fans are skinny, some are not so skinny

2263
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
well, it's just large

2264
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
the one size fits all

2265
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
well better, you know, some people are larger

2266
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
than large, so

2267
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
you just have to

2268
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
you just have to hang them on the wall

2269
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
if you can't fit into them

2270
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
fair enough

2271
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
make your cat wear them

2272
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
yes, Pac-Man and Galaga dimensions

2273
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
so that's for the 3DS

2274
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
uh

2275
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
and the Sims 3 Town Life

2276
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
stuff expansion is going to be coming out on

2277
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
PC

2278
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
that's literally

2279
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
it, I mean, it's

2280
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
that dead

2281
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
well then let's go to the

2282
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Xbox 360 in Japan and talk about what's coming

2283
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
out there, on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week

2284
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Operation Flashpoint

2285
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Red River comes out this week as well as Dungeon

2286
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Siege 3 gets its Japanese

2287
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
release this week, that's it on the 360

2288
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
uh, those two games of course

2289
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
on the 28th, going to the Playstation 3

2290
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Dungeon Siege 3 there as well

2291
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Operation Flashpoint there as well

2292
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
and a game called Fit in 6

2293
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Karada o Kichiro

2294
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
6u no Yosu

2295
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
comes out this week, which I believe is just

2296
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
some type of like, like, Playstation

2297
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Move XR Fitness game, that I guess

2298
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
is a little more tailored

2299
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I don't know if this is a game we have here, it's by

2300
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Ubisoft, so I would

2301
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Fit in 6, yeah, I came out back in March

2302
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
oh, we have this here?

2303
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
shows how much attention I've been paying

2304
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
to the PlayStation, which I still don't own

2305
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I only know because I set

2306
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
these items up, so

2307
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
alright, then there you go

2308
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
going to, I wanna see if there's anything on the handhelds

2309
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
real quick, or maybe anything in Nintendo's world

2310
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
the Sony PSP

2311
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
has

2312
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Queensgate Spiral Chaos

2313
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
comes out this week in regular and limited

2314
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
or I guess like a special edition

2315
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Queensgate is a RPG

2316
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
become the queen of a dimension

2317
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
harness the power of the queens gate

2318
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
the door that connects to all game worlds

2319
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
is taken over by someone evil and

2320
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
ambitious, this game includes

2321
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Mai from King of Fighters

2322
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
and the ladies from Queensblade

2323
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
so this is kinda like a world's

2324
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
collide type of game, where there's

2325
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
other chicks from other series

2326
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
and it looks like a farting maid

2327
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
that's what that looks like to me in that picture

2328
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
doesn't look like she's going poot

2329
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
and it says hip, look at that

2330
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
who farts with the sound hip

2331
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
hip!

2332
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
cause she's swinging her hip, she's going poot

2333
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
with her hip, could be one of those loud

2334
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
wine poops, you know

2335
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
okay, that's plenty enough

2336
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
hey, I just made it with my mouth

2337
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Fit and Six also coming out on the Wii in Japan

2338
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
if you care, on the 3DS

2339
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Super Pokemon Scramble, I remember

2340
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
mentioning that last week, finally a Pokemon game

2341
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
on the 3DS, even though it's not, you know,

2342
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
the Pokemon game, it's

2343
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Pokemon Dynasty Warriors

2344
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
and lastly

2345
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
on the Nintendo DS, Devil Survivor 2

2346
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
from Atlus this week

2347
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
on the regular DS, non-3D flavor

2348
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
alright, how about the UK?

2349
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
we have a few things

2350
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
we have on the 26th, Call of Juarez

2351
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
the Cartel for PC

2352
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
and Dragon Age 2 Legacy

2353
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
for PS3, PC

2354
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Xbox 360

2355
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
and on the 27th, Project Dust

2356
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
from Ubisoft on Xbox 360

2357
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
that's about it

2358
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
a couple more news stories for you guys

2359
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
and then the classic game of the week, but first

2360
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
but first, uh

2361
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
there was a person that had

2362
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
the domain for modernwarfare3.com

2363
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
um

2364
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
they were

2365
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
somewhat anonymous via

2366
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
GoDaddy's domains by proxy

2367
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
hiding surface

2368
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
we use that by the way

2369
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
for our own website

2370
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
apparently a domain dispute

2371
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
from Modern Warfare 3's publisher

2372
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Activision

2373
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
has dissolved that shield

2374
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
it is now apparently

2375
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
known that it is owned by

2376
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
a guy from Florida named Anthony

2377
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Abram and

2378
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
he is now

2379
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
doing a bunch of random things with the website

2380
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
including, he was at one

2381
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
time redirecting it to Battlefield 3's

2382
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
main site and also

2383
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
spoofing

2384
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Modern Warfare 3's official

2385
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
site and um

2386
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
you know, making videos

2387
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
that are saying that Modern Warfare 3 is

2388
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
crap and blah blah blah

2389
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
the publisher of course Activision believes

2390
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
that Abram has

2391
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
no right or legitimate

2392
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
interest in the domain name and

2393
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
argues that it's entitled to control

2394
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
given its history with the Modern Warfare

2395
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
IP. Yeah I love how that's

2396
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
granted that this guy, yeah he is

2397
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
a troll and he is

2398
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
the domain name because he knows that

2399
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Activision is going to have a Modern Warfare 3

2400
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
game at some point. That being

2401
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
said, I still think he should have the website

2402
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
and just because

2403
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Activision has a game

2404
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
for example if I

2405
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
register a website that's like

2406
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I don't know

2407
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
awesomesauce.com

2408
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
or something like that and let's just assume

2409
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
that there's no such thing as awesomesauce

2410
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
some person out there decides

2411
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
hey you know what,

2412
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Heinz57 is going to come out with

2413
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
awesomesauce and we want

2414
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
that domain. You give it to

2415
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
us because we want it.

2416
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I don't think that because you want something

2417
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
in your company that you should get that.

2418
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I mean

2419
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I think that you should have registered

2420
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
that domain a long time ago then.

2421
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Because you know, Activision

2422
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I don't know what to tell you but

2423
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
back when you were doing Modern Warfare 2

2424
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I could have told you that there was going to be a Modern Warfare 3

2425
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
and I mean

2426
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
that's just dumb.

2427
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
He should have done the

2428
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
smarter thing and he should have had

2429
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
some type of club or something

2430
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
that was like the name Modern Warfare

2431
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
or something if he wanted to be smarter about it.

2432
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Like for instance, I remember this

2433
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
reading about this, the guy who owns

2434
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
or at least did own, I don't know if he still

2435
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
does, I haven't checked it in years but

2436
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
sting.com, the musician

2437
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Sting tried to sue the guy who owns it

2438
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
because he wanted the domain because he is

2439
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
the celebrity Sting. He is

2440
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
you know, he knows that name.

2441
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
But the guy who owned the domain

2442
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
wasn't trying to troll Sting. He wasn't

2443
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
holding the domain for Sting asking for

2444
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
hundreds of dollars. He was some type of

2445
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
he was either a gamer or something

2446
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
where like that was his handle. And that's what he was

2447
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
known as in the online community. He was Sting

2448
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
for whatever reason. Like he just had

2449
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
nothing to do with the musician. What if he had been the wrestler

2450
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Sting? Perhaps he was, I don't know.

2451
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Well the internet foundation

2452
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
or whatever actually found in favor of the guy

2453
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
that he had every right to the

2454
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
name that if Sting wanted it he should have got it first.

2455
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And you know, and I think to

2456
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
the argument of this guy, Modern Warfare 3

2457
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
that's not the title

2458
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
of the game. That's the subtitle of the game.

2459
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
It's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.

2460
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
You know, it's not like Hello Kitty

2461
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Modern Warfare 3. It's

2462
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Call of Duty. That is, you know

2463
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
if he had his website was

2464
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3

2465
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
yeah I think there's a problem there because

2466
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
now you're infringing on, you know, the intellectual

2467
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
properties of Activision.

2468
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
But this is just trolling. It's just like

2469
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
whitehouse.com. It's a porn site.

2470
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Or it was a porn site.

2471
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
You know, too fucking bad.

2472
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
If the White House

2473
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
can't get a god damn URL

2474
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
then Activision should

2475
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
not get a god damn URL.

2476
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
But if the guy was just

2477
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
trolling and has no legitimate purpose

2478
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
to have that title.

2479
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Just like these people, like

2480
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
some person sat on JuliaRoberts.com

2481
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
and tried to basically

2482
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
sell it back to her for like

2483
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
$10,000. That's just

2484
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
that's just embezzlement. But he's not doing that.

2485
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
He's just being an asshole. Or not embezzlement.

2486
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
And you know what? He has the right to be an asshole

2487
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
on the internet. And you know what?

2488
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I don't think he does.

2489
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I think in this case. If he has no

2490
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
legitimate purpose for holding that website

2491
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I don't think he

2492
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I'm just saying he wasn't smart about how he

2493
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
used it. He should have used it. If he wanted

2494
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
to he could have had a dissertation about

2495
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
how Modern Warfare 3 is going to be a

2496
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
terrible game or how to be a review on

2497
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Modern Warfare 3 and I think he would have had more

2498
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
of a say. I don't know.

2499
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
It just, you know, I think

2500
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
if you're not going to use it for anything

2501
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
worthwhile, there's that

2502
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
committee that'll say, you bring nothing good

2503
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
to the internet. We're shutting you down.

2504
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
SSJ100Matt fuck you in the chat. Yes

2505
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
he changed his name to that. Says, I'm

2506
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
going to register OrangelaungeRadio2.com.

2507
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Well, okay.

2508
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Here's what

2509
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Modern Warfare 2's official website

2510
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
ModernWarfare2.InfinityWar.com

2511
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Oh, well I guess

2512
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I can't use that anymore.

2513
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Oh, damn.

2514
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
But I mean, they have a CallOfDuty.com

2515
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
They can easily do a CallOfDuty

2516
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
slash ModernWarfare3 or

2517
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
they can do Mw3 since that's how

2518
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
it's displayed on the box. I mean

2519
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
there's plenty of

2520
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
things out there. What if

2521
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
What's on that website right now if you try to

2522
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
go to it? What if he went to Modern

2523
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
if he did ModernWarfare3.net

2524
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
or something like that? Is that going to still

2525
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
be an issue? I'm going to the website right now. If this

2526
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
auto plays anything. Oh no, it's just

2527
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
a totally blank page.

2528
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
No source code or nothing.

2529
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
There you go.

2530
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Thank you. Sturlock

2531
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
rescue me. Extorting. Why couldn't I think of

2532
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
that word? Extorting money out of her.

2533
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
That's what they were trying to do to Julia Roberts. Thank you.

2534
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Minute and a half later. Thank you buffer.

2535
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
If your Activision just

2536
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
like seriously, who cares?

2537
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I mean look at like the ModernWarfare2.com

2538
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
was a website

2539
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
and you know it's a ModernWarfare2

2540
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
fan site or something.

2541
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I mean if like if I came out

2542
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
what if I go and register

2543
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
ModernWarfare4.com

2544
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
What are they going to do?

2545
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
But

2546
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I'm going to put some stupid articles about Modern

2547
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Warfare like you know hey there's guns.

2548
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
You should go register

2549
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
MegaManLegends3.com right now since you

2550
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
know no one else is going to use it now.

2551
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Do they

2552
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
is there a MegaManLegends3.com

2553
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
hold on.

2554
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Sorry for the dead air but I have to check.

2555
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Oh no somebody's

2556
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
holding it. It's a troll holding

2557
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
it saying this website's for sale by

2558
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
owner and it's just a bunch of links.

2559
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
That's been going on though since

2560
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
the early dot com

2561
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
business days too. Oh yeah.

2562
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
There's nothing new. Those guys

2563
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
need to be tossed out immediately.

2564
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Like if I show that I have a legitimate business

2565
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
purpose for those guys

2566
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
need to get tossed. And here's ModernWarfare4.com

2567
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
with a clown on it.

2568
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
It says welcome to ModernWarfare4.

2569
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
website. It would appear that Infinity Ward

2570
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
forgot to purchase this domain. No worries

2571
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
we have good

2572
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
of course they have no spelling.

2573
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
We have good care of it.

2574
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Is this an extortion plot too?

2575
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Are we breaking the

2576
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
story here that there is

2577
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
this whole time there's been a ModernWarfare4.com

2578
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
You've all been

2579
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
focused on ModernWarfare3 all

2580
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
week? Well there's a ModernWarfare4

2581
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
out there. There's not a five

2582
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I'm gonna register five.

2583
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
ModernWarfare5 that's mine.

2584
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Go get it quick.

2585
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Use a GoDaddy

2586
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
registration code to do that. Oh wait

2587
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
we're not sponsored by GoDaddy.

2588
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
That would be hilarious.

2589
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Go ahead.

2590
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Take the domain.

2591
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Could

2592
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
someone register would somebody be willing to spend

2593
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
the twenty bucks to register ModernWarfare5.com

2594
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
It's not even twenty bucks it's ten. Ten dollars.

2595
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Really? Ten dollars. What would we point

2596
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
it to if we bought ModernWarfare5.com

2597
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
right now? What would we point it to? The

2598
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Ooga Booga site. No.

2599
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
We can make some really

2600
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
fake looking box art or something.

2601
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Nerf fan site.

2602
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Modern Warfare with Nerf.

2603
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
It's Nerf and Nerf.

2604
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Would you be willing to post for pictures

2605
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
modeling with the Nerf bats and so forth?

2606
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
No. You haven't seen Dan's bucket

2607
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
of Nerf. And that could be our

2608
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
little, see we shouldn't say this on the

2609
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
podcast though cause now somebody's registering it right

2610
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
now as we speak. But what it could be

2611
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I'm cool with you doing that as long as you

2612
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
give it to us cause what we need to do

2613
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
we need to have our Nerf club called the

2614
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Modern Warfare club and it's just us clubbing

2615
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
each other with Nerf bats and stuff.

2616
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Well I've actually got not just

2617
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
the Nerf sword, the broadsword

2618
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I have the axe and the mace.

2619
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
And we have a bunch of Nerf guns.

2620
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
A lot of Nerf guns.

2621
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
And the orange bat.

2622
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Nice.

2623
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
What about StreetFighter5.com?

2624
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
No.

2625
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
No because Capcom won't have that out for another ten years.

2626
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Ah see ActDeft I love

2627
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
that thought. ActDeft says redirect

2628
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
it to President Cat.

2629
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
A plus.

2630
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Send it to the Renowee Twitter.

2631
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Why not?

2632
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I like that.

2633
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
That's actually a really good idea. I like that.

2634
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Easm said it should go to the

2635
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
NRA. Let's put it this way.

2636
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
If Professor Genki is so popular

2637
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
in Saints Row 3 President Cat should

2638
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
easily be able to come out over here.

2639
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Alright but just

2640
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
a footnote and word of warning.

2641
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
If you register Modern Warfare 5 and give it to us

2642
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
to put our pictures of Nerf fights on

2643
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
if you get sued that's on you.

2644
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Like I disavow every knowledge

2645
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
that this conversation ever happened.

2646
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
SSJ100MattFuckYou says

2647
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Rob we really should register a Dance Dance Revolution

2648
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
site and see if Konami gives a shit.

2649
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Wouldn't mind trolling them.

2650
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Here's a better one. What if you did it as

2651
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
COD Modern Warfare 5

2652
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
and you're fighting with CODs

2653
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
like fish.

2654
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Like actual trout

2655
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
snapping IRL.

2656
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Like M-I-R-C.

2657
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
It could just be pictures. Sky slaps

2658
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Dark Sakura with a trout and it would

2659
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
be actually me slapping her with a trout.

2660
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
That would be hilarious.

2661
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
That would not be hilarious.

2662
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
That would be smelly.

2663
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Alright moving on. Speaking of smelly

2664
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
no I got nothing. We got

2665
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
actually this might be kind of smelly. You know the character

2666
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Poison from Fatal

2667
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
or excuse me Final Fight. You mean the

2668
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
transgender? Is she

2669
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
really? Yes.

2670
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Is this transgender? Yes it actually

2671
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
is officially said on

2672
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
like way back in an old

2673
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
interview with one of the game designers.

2674
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
It was supposed to be because

2675
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
they couldn't make her a woman in the game

2676
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
because it wasn't right to hit a woman

2677
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
so that's why they made her

2678
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
a man.

2679
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And then they changed the character sprite

2680
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
in the US. And I think in other

2681
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
places they gave her a longer skirt and covered

2682
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
up her boob. But yeah

2683
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
officially Poison is

2684
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
supposed to be transgendered.

2685
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Well guess what? You're going to kick some tranny ass

2686
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
in Street Fighter versus

2687
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Tekken or you can kick ass as

2688
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
a tranny. It's equal opportunity.

2689
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
It is available there.

2690
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
It's going to be Poison is one

2691
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
of the characters there as well as

2692
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
what else was announced here?

2693
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Dalsim and then from Tekken

2694
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Steve Fox and Yoshimitsu.

2695
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Dude Steve Fox was kind of fun. All announced as

2696
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
characters. I wonder if Poison would whip out her dick

2697
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
and smack people.

2698
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Special attack surprise!

2699
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I'm all for a diverse character line up in the game

2700
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
but here's the thing.

2701
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Is that if it's Street Fighter cross Tekken

2702
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
she's a Final Fight character

2703
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
and okay I get it like Guy

2704
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Cody they kind of crossed over too

2705
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
but does that mean everybody

2706
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
from Final Fight is now part of the Street Fighter

2707
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
canon? Then why can't Poison be

2708
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
in Ultimate Marvel

2709
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
versus Capcom 3?

2710
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Maybe a download character.

2711
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
I don't know. It just

2712
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
seems like a strange pick

2713
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
to me with so many characters in the Street Fighter

2714
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
universe but okay. They want to

2715
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
bring back or maybe they just

2716
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
somebody really wants to put. It's because they're super

2717
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom 3.

2718
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
See you know what sucks is now I have

2719
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
that song running through my head.

2720
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
That Bill Biv DeVoe song.

2721
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Good lord.

2722
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Alright.

2723
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Moving on.

2724
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Yeah that was at a panel by the way at Comic Con

2725
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
2011 where it was announced that those

2726
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
characters would be in the game

2727
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
and I guess

2728
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Hugo, Cody, and Guy

2729
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
have also been teased for the game.

2730
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Well that would make sense if

2731
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Poison's in it that Guy and Cody are going to show up at some point

2732
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
as well. Gosh I wonder how many characters

2733
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
this game is supposed to have.

2734
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
It's crazy.

2735
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
So there you go. All characters

2736
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
that are set to come out in Street Fighter cross

2737
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Tekken which is a game that I'm

2738
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
pretty excited about actually.

2739
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It should be like Andori

2740
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
who was actually based off of Andre the Giant.

2741
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Oh yeah?

2742
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
But they changed his name because of the state.

2743
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Oh right. I remember

2744
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
those characters that look just like

2745
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Andre the Giant.

2746
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Funny.

2747
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Alright. Let's move on to the

2748
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
classic game of the week.

2749
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Yay. Every week

2750
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
here on Orange Launch Radio we like to take a

2751
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
trip down memory lane. Where's my theme music?

2752
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Have I lost the theme music?

2753
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
This is

2754
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
a big deal.

2755
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Where's the theme music?

2756
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
There we go.

2757
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Yay. This is going to be a very bad

2758
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
mood if I couldn't hear this happy music. Anyway

2759
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
the classic game of the week is a chance for us to walk

2760
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
down memory lane and check out

2761
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
a game that Dark Soccer

2762
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
thinks hey you kids should be playing this game

2763
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
right now. Good luck finding one.

2764
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Well

2765
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
regardless here it is your classic game of the week.

2766
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
The classic game

2767
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
of the week is Planet Harriers

2768
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
which I brought up

2769
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
at the beginning of the show and I've

2770
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
brought up constantly throughout past shows

2771
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I'm finally reviewing it because dammit

2772
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
this game is awesome.

2773
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
But it is

2774
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
part of the Space Harrier series and it has a

2775
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
twin cabinet so two people can play at the same

2776
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
time or you can do a networked

2777
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
two player game and

2778
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
you actually play seated

2779
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
and it's controlled through a joystick

2780
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
and a missile and a bullet trigger

2781
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
and you can change your views and you have

2782
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
bomb buttons all on the main panel.

2783
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
So you can choose either four characters.

2784
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
It's Glenn, X, Cory or Nick

2785
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
and basically they

2786
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
fly on the screen and you are

2787
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
behind them so it's

2788
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
that sort of

2789
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
third

2790
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
person style but not

2791
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
quite. And then in two player

2792
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
mode you actually can dock together to save

2793
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
your life and it has the opa opa in it

2794
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
because you cannot have a game

2795
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
in the fantasy zone without the opa

2796
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
opa.

2797
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
So

2798
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
this game, a little bit more information

2799
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
about it is that it actually

2800
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
was

2801
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
on the

2802
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
kakaru system which

2803
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
was basically a double mountain

2804
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
and you can

2805
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
you don't play versus you play

2806
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
as a team to clear off the screen and your joystick

2807
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
is an eight way stick

2808
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
and it's stereo sound

2809
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
and the game came out in 2001

2810
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
and you know the last place that I saw one at

2811
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
was at Great America when we went

2812
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
to see Margaret Cho.

2813
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
They had that there? They had that there.

2814
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Wow. That's pretty cool.

2815
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
And I remembered because

2816
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
oh the female character that

2817
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
you can play basically she wears

2818
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
a nurse's outfit and shoots a giant

2819
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
syringe as her weapon.

2820
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
But it's also cool because the final boss

2821
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
in this game will

2822
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
turn into a variety of different shapes

2823
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
like it'll be a fish or waves

2824
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
and one of the things it turns into is the Dreamcast logo.

2825
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
The little squirrel.

2826
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
But yeah I mean it's basically

2827
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
you know you

2828
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
have obstacles in your way and

2829
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
when you're actually on the ground you're

2830
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
running on the ground like in Space Harrier

2831
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
but when you're in the air you're shooting

2832
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
and it's got great music

2833
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
it's got great graphics for 2001

2834
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
and it only ever came out in the arcade

2835
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
there was a talk of them doing a

2836
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Dreamcast port. Never happened.

2837
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Which I don't see

2838
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
why they didn't because it would be super easy

2839
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
given you know

2840
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
how the Dreamcast is basically

2841
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
now me.

2842
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
The other thing that I liked about this one too and it's actually the part

2843
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
that you just got to on Video Rob is it has

2844
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
a shop like in

2845
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Fantasy Zone.

2846
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I was going to say it reminds me of Fantasy Zone.

2847
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Yeah so you can go in and you buy like

2848
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
big bombs or more speed or

2849
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
more shield

2850
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
and you use it to power yourself up as you go along

2851
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
because you're also collecting

2852
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
your points and your money

2853
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
as you go along too.

2854
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
So it's just a really neat game

2855
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
and they didn't

2856
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
really I think make a whole lot of them

2857
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
and it kind of died out so

2858
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
there's no home version of this.

2859
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Now I've been trying

2860
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
to find it emulated and from

2861
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
what I understand

2862
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
what was it that I downloaded today?

2863
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Apparently

2864
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
the main

2865
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
.14164

2866
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
bit runs it but I

2867
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
don't think very well.

2868
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I haven't been able to find much more else about

2869
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
the emulation but really that's the only way

2870
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
you're probably going to be able to play it unless you have to

2871
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
know where one is and if you know where one is

2872
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
tell me so that I can go play it.

2873
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I was so pissed off when we went to the

2874
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Sega Arcade in Seattle to Gameworks

2875
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
and they did not have a Planet Harrier.

2876
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
How could they not have a Planet Harriers?

2877
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
They should just we need to have

2878
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
a set release called

2879
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
The Ultimate Fantasy Zone

2880
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
which is all the Fantasy Zone games including

2881
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Fantasy Zone The Maze and Space Harrier

2882
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
and Planet Harriers.

2883
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Oh you could also

2884
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
you also did have a bonus of characters

2885
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
in there but I did not remember how to get them.

2886
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I thought you were going to buy the former Sunrise Fun

2887
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Center and make it your bitch and you were

2888
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
going to put all these great games in that place.

2889
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
You know what? When I have money

2890
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I'll be doing that.

2891
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
So maybe in

2892
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
2035.

2893
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
But that is the classic game.

2894
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
There it is. Planet Harrier.

2895
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Your classic plastic game of the week.

2896
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
The seat is plastic.

2897
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Your classic game

2898
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
of the week. Alright we got plenty

2899
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
more show to go but don't go anywhere.

2900
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
We're going to be right back after this quick break

2901
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio

2902
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
including more news on things like Minecraft

2903
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
and Child of Eden on the

2904
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Playstation 3 and then we're going to talk about

2905
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
getting sued. Good times.

2906
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Of course your calls and

2907
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
so excited. A list list tonight.

2908
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Yay. So we're going to do a list

2909
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
list tonight when we come back with more of

2910
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

2911
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Welcome back everybody to

2912
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
episode number 421 of

2913
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Orange Lounge Radio. Live on this

2914
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
July the 24th of 2011

2915
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
as we are live of course every

2916
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
week Sunday nights at All Games Radio

2917
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
www.allgames.com

2918
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
and there's lots of great stuff.

2919
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
If you can't tune in on Sunday nights you should listen to

2920
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
allgames.com throughout the week. There's a lot of other great shows

2921
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
many of them live that tape

2922
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
throughout the week so check that out.

2923
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I thought before we get into part B in the

2924
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
news tonight I wanted to touch on this story.

2925
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
This is something that Salacious Pop brought to my

2926
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
attention this week and I

2927
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
thought for sure Dark Sakura

2928
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
of all people might have a perspective

2929
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
on this one so I'm going to kind of blindside

2930
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
her a little bit with this story. Yeah. Because

2931
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
this has to do with women

2932
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
kind of. Let me explain.

2933
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Okay I'm equipped. Alright.

2934
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Well sort of. Wait till I get to this.

2935
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Okay. So Kotaku ran this story earlier this

2936
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
week. This is something that Salacious Pop

2937
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
emailed me and the title is called

2938
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Well That's One Way to Combat

2939
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Misogyny in Gaming.

2940
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
And what it's basically getting at is that there's a

2941
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
large LAN party that happens in Texas

2942
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
and it's being organized to celebrate

2943
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
the launch of Battlefield 3.

2944
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Which is you know this big game that's being launched

2945
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
and so forth. They've decided that the best

2946
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
way to deal with slurs

2947
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
that end up getting hurled at

2948
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
female gamers at these events

2949
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
is to just prevent women from attending.

2950
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
So no women will be allowed

2951
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
to attend this event in

2952
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Texas. Let me read a

2953
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
quote from the FAQ. Hold on. Hold on.

2954
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Quote

2955
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Nothing ruins a good LAN party

2956
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
like a woman. No that's not the quote.

2957
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Okay. Nothing ruins a good

2958
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
LAN party like uncomfortable guests

2959
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
or lots of tension.

2960
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Both of which can result from mixing

2961
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
immature misogynistic male gamers

2962
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
with female counterparts.

2963
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Though we've done our best to avoid these

2964
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
situations in years past, we've

2965
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
certainly had our share of problems.

2966
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
As a result we no longer allow

2967
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
women to attend the event.

2968
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Now

2969
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
thoughts so far before I read the

2970
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
update. I will be fair. This paragraph

2971
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
has since been changed but let's

2972
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
let's hear dark soccer's initial reaction.

2973
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
If they're a private organization

2974
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
and

2975
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
then they do have

2976
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
the right as a private

2977
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
organization. However

2978
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
you

2979
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
have the right to call them dickheads.

2980
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Well

2981
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
it just goes back to lower

2982
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
my impression of Texas.

2983
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
People

2984
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
do not have any logic

2985
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
in the south and I can say this because I'm

2986
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
there. It's like

2987
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
very few people

2988
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
think

2989
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
outside of

2990
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
the box. Just go for

2991
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
well this will be the easy way we just won't have

2992
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
chicks there huh? Well for this whole weekend they

2993
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
will all be thinking outside of the box

2994
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
because there will be no boxes at this

2995
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
event if you know what I mean.

2996
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Well this is why

2997
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
sorry that this

2998
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
is why male

2999
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
geeks get a bad rep.

3000
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
You are afraid

3001
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
of us. And so

3002
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
when we kick your ass you have to

3003
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
resort to name calling.

3004
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Like you do with

3005
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
when some noob kicks your ass.

3006
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
It's just immaturity

3007
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
is all it is. They just name call everybody

3008
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
and it's the women that get upset

3009
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
about it.

3010
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Maybe if women would cry less they

3011
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
get invited to these events.

3012
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Well no I think the whole thing is that

3013
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
you know it would be

3014
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
exactly the same if it were two guys okay.

3015
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
You have guy one going oh you stupid slut

3016
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
and she goes oh yeah you dumb prick.

3017
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
You know instead you have like you asshole

3018
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
bitch. Well I'm going to

3019
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
tell you this. I'm going to tell you this.

3020
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
It's not going to stop

3021
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
that whole and you can't tell me this

3022
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
doesn't happen in Texas.

3023
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
You kill me stop being such

3024
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
a fag. You're being a fag.

3025
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
You're a little fag right now and

3026
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I guarantee you

3027
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
in a room like that there's going to

3028
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
be at least one.

3029
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Who passed the penis check.

3030
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
And the other thing too if you got to

3031
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
complain about people killing you in a

3032
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
death match where the point is to kill

3033
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
each other

3034
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I don't I don't understand why are you killing

3035
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
me. Why are you killing me because it's

3036
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
the point of the game. I'm calling for

3037
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
infiltration.

3038
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Infiltration. Women women

3039
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
run in stampede.

3040
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Burn your bras. No.

3041
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I'm calling for

3042
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
chick drag. Chick drag.

3043
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
You know what exists. Oh yeah

3044
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
oh god. I was I was at the bar

3045
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
one night with friends with a birthday

3046
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
celebration. We got there a little early and we walked

3047
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
right in on a drag king show. I kid you not

3048
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
and that's what you'd

3049
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
expect. I was some drag kings and some nice butch

3050
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
lesbians to go in. It was it was very

3051
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
butch. It was

3052
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
not it was it wasn't sassy like

3053
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
drag queens are you know. Drag queens are

3054
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
very sassy. Because drag queens are taking

3055
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
the ultimate of

3056
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
the feminine mystique

3057
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
and playing playing

3058
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
it all of it up. So that's the same thing for

3059
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
drag kings that they take the boring

3060
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
dude-ness and make it more boring and

3061
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
dudely. Alright going to the chatroom

3062
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
at chat.org.com tons of comments in chat

3063
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
here. Act Dev says they should ban the immature

3064
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
people instead of women. Breakman

3065
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
says nothing ruins. Everyone in Texas.

3066
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Nothing ruins a good sausage fest like

3067
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
a woman.

3068
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Um

3069
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
uh let's see

3070
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
going uh what's this uh

3071
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
laha says this is why we can't have nice

3072
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
things. Frisbee says

3073
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
this isn't the south this is Texas.

3074
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Alright look to be fair there was an update. They did remove that paragraph and here's what happened.

3075
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
They're saying this event is a gentleman's retreat.

3076
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Quote we actively discourage gamers from being the kind of misogynistic jack wagon seen in the reddit post and such

3077
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
behavior should not be tolerated.

3078
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Frankly we don't like that kind of

3079
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
player either. So far as this event

3080
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
goes it's a special event designed

3081
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
specifically for male gamers.

3082
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Further it is meant as a getaway

3083
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
designed to help said male

3084
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
contingent become better men

3085
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
both for themselves and for those who love

3086
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
us.

3087
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Yeah that's more bullshit.

3088
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I gotta tell ya

3089
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I gotta tell ya

3090
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
I've never been to no I was in Texas

3091
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
once for like five minutes. For the few smart

3092
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
people in Texas like Travis

3093
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
you're not on the

3094
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
stupid list. Yes. Most everybody

3095
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
else is on the stupid list. I know I know plenty

3096
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
of smart people in Texas and there's

3097
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
some that listen to this show actually. It's just

3098
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
it's like Jeff Foxworthy says

3099
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
when it comes time to talk about the south

3100
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
the news always points out the

3101
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
least common denominator.

3102
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
You know. Here's the

3103
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
thing I gotta admit there's a part

3104
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
of me that's a little bit tempted since it

3105
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
is an all male retreat.

3106
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
It's only forty nine bucks

3107
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
maybe I should go and

3108
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
maybe I should flame it up a little bit.

3109
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
You know what. I

3110
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
heard there was a retreat.

3111
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Oh my god

3112
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
we're gonna play some battlefield.

3113
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I loves battlefield.

3114
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
He just shot you in the head

3115
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
what a stupid bitch.

3116
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
There's a small

3117
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
part of me that wants to even though I would

3118
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I would play up to every negative stereotype

3119
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I'm sure these guys already have like I just

3120
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
you know there's that part of me that just

3121
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
wants to ruin

3122
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
their day. Now here's my idea.

3123
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
One

3124
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
you either have the infiltration go

3125
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
on have a woman beat

3126
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
all the guys asses and go oh by the way here's my

3127
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
boobs. Or

3128
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
the ladies have their own counter retreat.

3129
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Say fine

3130
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
you're not inviting us bitches you're not

3131
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
allowed.

3132
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
And

3133
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
some interesting comments from chat here

3134
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Black Wolf says are they also telling

3135
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
black people to stay home. No

3136
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
race is not a part of this.

3137
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
So they're just sexist not racist.

3138
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
They're just sexist and I'm

3139
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
gonna just guess with

3140
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
nothing to back me up also homophobic.

3141
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Duh it's Texas.

3142
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
And maybe a little bit racist but I don't know

3143
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
but no we're not seeing any apparent

3144
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
racism going on here. Okay.

3145
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Salacious Pop says Loki I feel

3146
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
that women who opt into participating in that

3147
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
first person shooter culture know what they're getting into

3148
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
to a point but neckbeards realize

3149
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
this and decide to escalate it until it

3150
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
becomes pretty disgusting and unacceptable

3151
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
no matter what kind of game it is and a line just

3152
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
gets crossed. And you should be able to shit

3153
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
talk without going the gender race

3154
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
gay route. It just means you're not very

3155
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
articulate. Aha

3156
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
become a smarter cut lower

3157
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
person.

3158
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
There you go. You just need to be smarter

3159
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
about your

3160
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
cut downs.

3161
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
But I mean and I'm

3162
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
and this

3163
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
is why I say this and people

3164
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
smart people in the south will know what I'm

3165
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
talking about is that

3166
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
that's just it just is like

3167
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
typical. It's just

3168
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
typical.

3169
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Black Wolf in our chatroom says devil's advocate

3170
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
there are plenty of female only

3171
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
LAN events and that's empowering girl

3172
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
gamers.

3173
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
True. But you you don't

3174
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
want to backpedaling here a little

3175
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
bit. So it makes it know that they have

3176
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
the frag dolls and the reason why

3177
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
they're doing well team

3178
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
so they don't they don't

3179
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
allow man in the frag dolls at all. Like if I try

3180
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
to be a frag doll I couldn't do it.

3181
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Yeah you go ahead and play your first

3182
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
person shooters step into Grand Theft

3183
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Auto and we'll own your

3184
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
but

3185
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
but the whole the whole point is just

3186
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
that it's it's really

3187
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
and break man is asking us to stop hating

3188
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
on the neck beards please. He has

3189
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
a neck beer and he's feeling a little offended right now so

3190
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
that we need to stop being neck beer

3191
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
phobic. Hey

3192
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
ZZ top.

3193
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
All right. But but my

3194
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
point is

3195
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
this is shit that I've run into

3196
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
all the time when I lived in Alabama.

3197
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Like

3198
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I could be the

3199
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
my geek knowledge far

3200
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
exceeded any of the guys

3201
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
but you know

3202
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
we're doing a guy party sorry.

3203
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Fuck you.

3204
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
I just kicked your ass

3205
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
at this game yesterday is that why I'm not going?

3206
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
No comment.

3207
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Yeah. All right look

3208
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I just wanted to bring that up at some point.

3209
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I didn't mean to you know dominate our show with that

3210
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
talk but I thought it would be an interesting little

3211
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
aside. We do have a list list coming up

3212
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
later this hour so stay tuned for that

3213
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
and also we're

3214
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
going to get into the rapid fire news

3215
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
but I got to do quick plugs for other shows

3216
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Hoard House is my World of

3217
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Warcraft podcast I do with my buddy

01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
end but there's a contest this week as well for

3222
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
free game time which any WoW player

3223
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
is going to want and I know is a good prize there

3224
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
so check that out. Hoardhouse.com

3225
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000

you could stomach on the World of Warcraft

3228
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Has anyone

3229
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
guessed it on any podcast or anything this week?

3230
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Yes!

3231
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
What did you guess on this week? Well as I said last week

3232
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I'm on two episodes

3233
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
of Pop Culture Parlay

3234
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Ah you did an episode arc. Yes.

3235
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Which you can go to

3236
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000

01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
you were on while I was driving to the store

3241
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
or something. And I was recently on Girls

3242
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Gone Well. So you can look back for that

3243
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
episode too. The Mystery Third

3244
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
podcast I'm hoping will be a reality very

3245
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
soon. We've just had some

3246
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
We're Too Busy setbacks going on and

3247
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
knowing my week next week that's

3248
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
not going to get any better so we'll see what happens

3249
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000

01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Busy busy bee

3251
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
So hopefully we'll get that

3252
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
together. There is a third podcast coming

3253
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
It's not going to

3254
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
be like a huge thing. It will be like

3255
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
30 minutes tops a week

3256
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Brakeman suggests you go as Captain Sassy Pants

3257
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
We'll see

3258
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
So yeah

3259
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
that's to look forward to and then

3260
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
also speaking of like guesting on shows and stuff

3261
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I just want to kind of throw that out there like

3262
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
you know if you have a podcast or your own

3263
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
show I've heard some

3264
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
people say like oh well I would

3265
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
ask you to be on the show but my show is just

3266
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
this little little show that's

3267
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
nothing nothing serious and you know

3268
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I never wanted to ask you guys because I'm too shy

3269
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Dude if I have the time

3270
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I will gladly come on any show

3271
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000

3272
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
like negative

3273
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
about like as long as I'm not walking into a

3274
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
show that's all like homophobic trash talking

3275
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
and stuff like that but you know what I mean like if you're

3276
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
generally generally an intelligent person

3277
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
that's all I ask I'm gonna

3278
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000

01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
that large so don't

don't feel like you can't ever approach us

3282
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000

01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
we're approaching our tenth year of podcasting

3300
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
and we want it to be a big fucking deal

3301
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
so especially come next year

3302

we're going to try and go on as many shows as we can

3303
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
so we're always happy to do that

3304
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
anyhow so I want to say give us more stuff to plug

3305
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
at the top of part B

3306
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
until our third podcast launches

3307
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
alright let's get into some rapid

3308
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
fire news some news that

3309
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
we just didn't have time to cover elsewhere

3310
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
uh yes of course

3311
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
there's some more details now

3312
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
out about the 360

3313
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
port of Minecraft

3314
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
this is coming from Notch

3315
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
of course the guy behind Minecraft

3316
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
and saying there's actually going to be

3317
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
marketing for the Xbox 360 version

3318
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
of Minecraft so I've agreed

3319
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
to be slightly less transparent

3320
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
than usual when it comes to that

3321
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
version and

3322
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
basically saying that there's going to be some

3323
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
cool stuff in there including

3324
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
there's completely different crafting

3325
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
and that the Kinect functionality

3326
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
will include a mode where you have to wave your arms

3327
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
around to mine and

3328
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
use items it's just too silly not to

3329
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
include and also

3330
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
can you actually flail as you're running away from the ghost?

3331
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
ah!

3332
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
uh

3333
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
that's what I'm going to do at the gentleman's retreat

3334
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
for Battlefield by the way don't shoot me

3335
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I don't know about that

3336
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
basically

3337
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
he also said that there's of course

3338
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
the Xperia Play version of Minecraft

3339
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
that's going to be coming out

3340
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
for $7 sometime this

3341
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
fall and

3342
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
I guess it'll make it

3343
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
it's programmed in a way that'll make it easy to port to all sorts

3344
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
of mobile phones

3345
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
so that's kind of neat

3346
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
so I'm sure we'll hear more

3347
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
details as we get closer to its

3348
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
release I'm sure it'll be pretty big

3349
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
um if you

3350
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
just love Valve and you really want

3351
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
to get your hands on some Valve action

01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
figures and other stuff

3353
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
well you're going to wait until 2012

01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
that's going to be pretty awesome

3372
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I'm telling you though

3373
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
NECA um

3374
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
if you really want to impress me

3375
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
you'll do full size turret

3376
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
bots

3377
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
they come in the box do they sing

3378
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
because if that's the case I kind of want one

3379
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
will it randomly

3380
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
just go are you still there?

3381
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
you may remember that I am still working on my paper

3382
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
craft turret that is full size

3383
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
I do remember that

3384
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
occasionally when I'm not working

3385
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
on my Grand Theft Auto stuff I'll be working on that

3386
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
it looks nice

3387
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
it will be uh large

3388
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000

01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
um and then finally um

3392
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Grasshopper manufacturing is putting out

3401
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
a cheerleader raised by zombie hunters

3402
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
who uses her acrobatic training

3403
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
and chainsaws to destroy zombies

3404
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
wasn't that a side plot

3405
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
in Jurassic Park 2?

3406
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
where that acrobat little girl

3407
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
like kicked the dinosaur in the face

3408
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
yeah they said that was retarded

3409
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
this looks awesome

3410
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
hey hey hey you said you're not going to use that word anymore

3411
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
yeah whatever

3412
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000

3413
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
they have some screenshots up for it

3414
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
she's got a chainsaw

3415
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
with hearts on it and she's killing zombies

3416
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
so um it sounds to me

3417
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
almost a little bit like Oni Chambara

3418
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
um just

3419
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
hopefully plays a lot better

3420
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
and of course

3421
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
a Kiriyamaoka working on the sound

3422
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
nice

3423
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
so all good

3424
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
that would have made the Jurassic Park 2

3425
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
a lot better if Kiriyamaoka had done the soundtrack

3426
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
did you hear there's by the way a confirmed

3427
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Jurassic Park 4 is in development

3428
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
they want to bring that back

3429
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I loved those movies when I was a kid at least the first one

3430
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I think the plot of them you know

3431
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
somehow making it to mainland

3432
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
and kind of spreading would be pretty awesome

3433
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
no because that's what happened at the end of the second movie

3434
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
and it was terrible that's what made that movie so bad

3435
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
no what made it bad

3436
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
is just they have a feature of the T-Rex

3437
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I'm talking about like you know where

3438
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
it's years later where they're multiplying

3439
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
and coming out in small towns

3440
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
and stuff they have the planet of the dinosaurs

3441
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
you know track them down

3442
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
alright anyhow moving on with other rapid fire news

3443
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Team Fortress 2 whatever happens with big games

3444
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
they get demade that's right

3445
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
a demake has come out of Team Fortress 2

3446
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
it's now a 2D beat em up

3447
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
uh it's one guy

3448
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
running his own development house Eric Ruth

3449
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
from Team Fortress 2

3450
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Team Fortress Arcade is the name of the game

3451
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
it's an old school side scrolling beat em up

3452
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
each character that's from Team Fortress

3453
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
has weapons and ability that are similar to

3454
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
it's class in Team Fortress 2

3455
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
for example the Demoman can blast out sticky bombs

3456
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
and explode whenever he does the jumping

3457
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
engineerings can do upgrades

3458
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
with the wrench and so forth

3459
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
there's actually some hands on sessions

3460
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
that have been reviewed on around the internet

3461
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
and there's even a little YouTube there

3462
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
that I guess some site did

3463
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
review and you can actually I think he's probably

3464
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
talking over this but let me see if he get

3465
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
yeah he talks over that

3466
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
but you can actually see here in studio we can see the

3467
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
kind of gameplay emotion it looks like

3468
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
that old school kind of 2D fighter it looks kind of fun

3469
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
and Eric Ruth you may remember is the same guy

3470
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
did all the demakes of like you know

3471
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
all the NES things oh really

3472
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
like the Left 4 Dead so this guy's a

3473
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
pro hero yeah this guy's a pro

3474
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
good uh and also announced a

3475
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000

it could be fun we'll see

3497
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I really hope THQ brings Saints Row 3

anyhow

3510
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
this news is not quite as awesome as the

3511
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
horchata but it's very

3512
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
what is this going on here

3513
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
ok remember Mortal Kombat and the download characters

3514
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Mortal Kombat and we knew for

3515
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
quite some time that there was going to be

3516
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Kenshi there was going to be

3517
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Scarlet and Rain we knew those

3518
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
three characters for quite some time but

3519
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Warner Brothers really kept the

3520
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
fourth character under wraps for a long

3521
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
time well the fourth character was revealed

3522
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
this week the fourth download character

3523
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
from Mortal Kombat is going to be

3524
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
not Tanya not

3525
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Meat it's going to be Freddy Krueger

3526
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
to which a lot of people kind of went

3527
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
what kind of want

3528
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
like I think that was the reaction

3529
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
most of my friends was like ok

3530
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
it's kind of cool I guess I'll

3531
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I can do this I like the

3532
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
fatalities yeah

3533
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
no yeah the fatalities in the video were pretty awesome

3534
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
like throwing one into the incinerator or whatever

3535
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
the furnace because you had the boiler

3536
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
room and the first one that they showed

3537
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
with him pulling him down and the blood coming up

3538
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
that was a nod back to the first movie

3539
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
that was the scene right out of the first movie

3540
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Johnny Depp awesome

3541
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
so yeah Freddy Krueger

3542
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
is going to be the fourth download character

3543
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
it's really one of those things where you look at it and go

3544
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I don't get it but I kind of do

3545
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
it's not like it's something

3546
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
completely random I guess should be interesting

3547
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
so yeah that will cost you

3548
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
either $4.99 or $400

3549
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Microsoft points unless you're a season pass

3596
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
that's it

3597
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
awesome

3598
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
alright I guess we should go to the Twitter although

3599
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I forgot to plug that at the top of the show

3600
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
so I don't know if we actually got a lot of tweets tonight

3601
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
but that's okay because we're running along

3602
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
anyway so I guess something's got to give at some point

3603
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
what's going on in the twatter?

3604
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
let's go look at the twatter right now

3605
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
before I get to Twitter though can I say

3606
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
there's another game I've been playing this week that I forgot to mention

3607
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
and I just caught myself looking at it

3608
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
so I have to say

3609
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
on the iPhone there's this game called

3610
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Tiny Tower

3611
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I think a lot of people are playing this

3612
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
but yeah I'm playing

3613
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Tiny Tower and I can't stop playing

3614
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
this game and what it is

3615
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
it's kind of like Sim Tower

3616
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
dumbed down and what's really cute about

3617
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
it is that all your characters are little 8-bit characters

3618
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
you have this tower you can build

3619
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
these different types of levels including

3620
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
apartments that they live in and

3621
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
you can take characters up and down the stairs

3622
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
but what I love about this most is that if you go

3623
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
on the menu there's this thing called BitBook

3624
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
and you can look at what the citizens of

3625
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
your tower are posting on their BitBooks

3626
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
and let's see

3627
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
like for instance I forgot to restock

3628
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
the plant nursery for like a couple hours

3629
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
because I'm doing this show so one of my people

3630
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
wrote on BitBook came to work at the

3631
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
plant nursery but no one is here

3632
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
it's just things like that but one

3633
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
the other day one of them wrote something like

3634
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
we're going to have a party to celebrate

3635
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
so and so moving in silly hats only

3636
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
and that really cracked me up because it was a reference

3637
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
to the cartoon Rejected

3638
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
awesome anyhow yeah that's a free

3639
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
game I've been playing the shit out of that because

3640
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
you know the tower bucks are what cost

3641
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
money but you don't need them to play the game

3642
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
so that whole thing going on

3643
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
alright anyhow

3644
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
back to the Twitter

3645
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
let's see going to the tweets

3646
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
getting into some

3647
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
twats here let's see

3648
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
DJ Rama has tweeted

3649
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
something that's going to come up in a little bit here

3650
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
on the show I think yeah it's coming up a little later

3651
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
so I can't read his tweet but let me go

3652
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
to Spazinator got the ball

3653
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
rolling on getting my PS3 fixed yesterday

3654
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
just waiting on the coffin now

3655
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
non-gaming news as of today

3656
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
gay marriage is now legal in New York State

3657
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
I think that's terrific and

3658
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I wish our state would catch up

3659
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I'm like it's not going to send

3660
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
like a gay wave across

3661
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
the nation I'm like

3662
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
gay people are going to be in happy

3663
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
committed stuff whether

3664
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
you choose to acknowledge it legally or not

3665
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
and when you don't acknowledge it legally that's called

3666
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
discrimination I'm like it's as simple as that

3667
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
like what are you going to accomplish

3668
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
banning gay marriage

3669
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
nothing

3670
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
but by doing it you are

3671
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I could get into that

3672
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
whole rant but it's just like

3673
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
I think D. Snyder said it

3674
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
best in a tweet this week yes I'm referring to

3675
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
D. Snyder from what was

3676
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Twisted Sister he said

3677
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
something like it's 2011

3678
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
if you don't finally support gay marriage then

3679
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
you're the problem

3680
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
anyhow

3681
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
that's how I feel if you don't agree with me deal with it

3682
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
let's see

3683
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I can't remember if this

3684
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
is coming up later or not I think I can

3685
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
talk about this one if I'm

3686
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
repeating a story coming up I apologize

3687
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
S.J. 100 Matt tweeted us with a story about

3688
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Bobby Kotick

3689
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Bobby Kotick opened his mouth again to spew more trash

3690
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
this week now he says DJ Hero was

3691
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
a huge mistake

3692
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
this is in an interview

3693
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
with Forbes magazine

3694
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Bobby Kotick says DJ Hero was a

3695
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
passion project

3696
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
we should have said well how many people

3697
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
really want to unleash their inner DJ

3698
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
and then out of the people who do want to unleash

3699
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
their inner DJ how many want to do it in the

3700
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
context of a game where you earn points

3701
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
versus just taking a DJ deck

3702
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
or tools on their Mac and actually being

3703
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
a DJ and it turns out it's a very

3704
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
small market

3705
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
and Bobby Kotick said that seeing DJ Hero

3706
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
fail despite critical claim in the marketing

3707
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
plan that pushed it down their throats was

3708
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
one of the hardest failures for him

3709
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
so there you go

3710
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
and he also talks about Guitar Hero

3711
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
and so on

3712
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
quote it was very clear people didn't want more 80's heavy

3713
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
metal music but what they wanted was

3714
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
very difficult for us to get from the music companies

3715
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
the number one thing

3716
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
that our audiences wanted in Guitar Hero was

3717
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Led Zeppelin but we couldn't get Led Zeppelin

3718
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
to consent to give us the rights

3719
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
interesting so kind of blaming

3720
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
the failure of Guitar Hero on the music

3721
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
industry and maybe there's only

3722
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
so many songs that people want to play

3723
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
especially when you look at Rock Band

3724
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
shit Rock Band has almost everything now

3725
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
seems like

3726
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
and I'm always wanting more

3727
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
so

3728
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
moving on to

3729
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
other tweets

3730
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Zether77 tweets us saying

3731
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
according to a YouTube video

3732
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Oppa Oppa is a hidden character in Planet Harriers

3733
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
yes

3734
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
but Oppa Oppa also makes appearances in levels

3735
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
ahh I see

3736
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
and somebody else I'm guessing is on his

3737
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
friends list what is this

3738
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
KeegeeKG responded to him

3739
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
and said I've been wanting that for years

3740
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
like since GameCube came out

3741
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
so you're not alone in your Planet Harrier love

3742
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Planet Harriers is like

3743
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
it did look pretty awesome

3744
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
it did look pretty awesome from the video you showed me

3745
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
I kind of wish I'd played that I had no idea that

3746
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
it was at Great America I just somehow

3747
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
overlooked that anyhow

3748
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Tiger Claw says this is a couple tweets one of them

3749
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
is about Majora's Mask that's right

3750
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
on the 3DS why not because

3751
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
you know we had Zelda Ocarina of Time

3752
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
on the 3DS why not

3753
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Majora's Mask

3754
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
well in an interview with Nintendo

3755
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Power

3756
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
E.G. Onoma who is

3757
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
one of the folks behind Zelda

3758
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
he says that

3759
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
it's a possibility

3760
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
and according to him in the interview here

3761
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
quote it wouldn't be an utter

3762
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
impossibility to see a remake

3763
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
so

3764
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I guess they're saying that if fans demanded

3765
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
it they would make it

3766
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
oh so that you'll do

3767
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
but oh the people wanting you to port

3768
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
a simple game that's already been localized

3769
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
nah you'll take a shit on them

3770
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
yep

3771
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
although I don't know I still think

3772
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Loki there's going to be a press conference

3773
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
where it says the fans demanded it

3774
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
of course they're going to and they're

3775
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
going to come out looking like the heroes

3776
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
look at those abs dude

3777
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
oh on poison

3778
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
look last tweet here

3779
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
from Tiger Claw about Wesley

3780
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Snipes he has made a video game

3781
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
from prison absolutely

3782
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
right this is Julius

3783
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Styles the International it's a video

3784
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
game that Wesley Snipes not to be

3785
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
confused with Julius Styles that's right

3786
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Wesley Snipes by the way most famous for his

3787
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
role in Tu Wong Fu thanks for everything

3788
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Julie Newmar

3789
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
he was

3790
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
he's developing the game in

3791
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
prison and he's developed

3792
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
he's teaming up with developer Lapland

3793
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
so he's been I guess writing down his ideas

3794
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
while he's in prison and it's a game that

3795
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
combines action movie characters

3796
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
like the type of character he played in

3797
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Blade and so forth into one

3798
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I guess character in a video game

3799
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I

3800
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
guess the game is only coming out on

3801
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
iPad and iPhone because

3802
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
those are probably the easiest platforms to publish on

3803
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
and we like criminals

3804
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
there you go Julius Styles if you want to support

3805
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Wesley Snipes and help fund his legal fund

3806
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
you can check out this game

3807
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
that's it

3808
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
for the Twitter tonight at Twitter.com

3809
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
slash OLR hey we're just

3810
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
about to tonight's list list I'm so

3811
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
excited we haven't done one of these in forever and I thought

3812
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
it's high time we do another game but first

3813
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
another bout of news for you

3814
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
ah yes

3815
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
you know it's like

3816
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
every other week we have a lawsuit against Zynga

3817
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
or you know

3818
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
even one week we had Zynga suing

3819
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
someone else but no this week it's

3820
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
actually a lawsuit against Zynga over Farmville

3821
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
of course the source code

3822
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
apparently a

3823
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
California based web developer named

3824
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
social apps

3825
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
they decided to

3826
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
sue Zynga because of alleged

3827
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
copyright infringement in violation

3828
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
of trade secrets breach of written

3829
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
contract breach of implied in fact

3830
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
contract and breach of

3831
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
confidence

3832
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
their argument is that they entered into

3833
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
agreement with Zynga whereas in Zynga

3834
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
would receive access to their source

3835
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
code for social apps

3836
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
for the social apps

3837
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Facebook game my farm in exchange

3838
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
for some form of compensation

3839
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
according to the suit

3840
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Zynga was given the code at which point they

3841
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
fled into the night never to be heard

3842
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
from again social apps

3843
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
claims that my farm's source code

3844
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
provided the foundation for

3845
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Farmville as well as its many

3846
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
derivatives and they're seeking

3847
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
permanent injunction damages

3848
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
attorneys fees as well as

3849
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
any of Zynga's

3850
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
profits or gains which can be

3851
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
attributed to Farmville

3852
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
so at least we have a legal

3853
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
story tonight that's not some patent

3854
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
or something like that I mean this claim does

3855
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
sound kind of interesting where

3856
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
you know you had the game my farm

3857
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
and they get it so they had my

3858
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
farm they gave the source code to Zynga

3859
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
and then Zynga

3860
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
would get would give them money

3861
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
that they never got is that what's that

3862
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
essentially this is about um am I hearing

3863
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
this right I guess but I

3864
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
don't know why if you would let someone

3865
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
look at your source code and expect them

3866
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
not to steal it you know what I mean

3867
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
I mean it's or use it in some

3868
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
way I guess exactly why

3869
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
would you want to do that what would be the point

3870
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
well maybe Zynga had the idea on

3871
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
how to get it out there I mean Zynga before they

3872
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
put out Farmville weren't they already huge for

3873
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Mafia Wars I don't know

3874
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
don't care so I could see

3875
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
where maybe you're gonna take somebody else's game

3876
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
and make it better and market it a little

3877
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
better and then make tons of money

3878
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
off of it but yeah you would owe them a piece of the

3879
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
profits but of course we're only hearing one side

3880
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
of this have we had an official response from Zynga yet

3881
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I guess not huh

3882
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
nope all right

3883
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
of course

3884
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
again Zynga is one of those companies where it's like

3885
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
it's really hard to root for them

3886
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
haha

3887
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
anyhow

3888
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
xbox.com

3889
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
we heard about this happening

3890
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
before that games would soon

3891
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
be a part of xbox.com

3892
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
but now I guess with

3893
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
games for windows you know now combining with

3894
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
xbox.com there are four

3895
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
free trial games that you can play

3896
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
on the xbox 360 homepage

3897
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
you can play them right in your browser

3898
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
and you don't have to install them to your computer or anything

3899
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
now the games that you can play

3900
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
plants vs zombies

3901
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
bejeweled 3, zuma's revenge

3902
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
and text twist 2 which are all

3903
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
pretty much popcap games or there's

3904
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
stuff that sound right off of uh

3905
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
um what is

3906
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
it the uh zone

3907
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
msn zone has been around forever and it had

3908
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
all those games too and it's kinda weird that

3909
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
microsoft hasn't brought that into the fold if they haven't already

3910
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
does that still exist

3911
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I remember I had an account there like

3912
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
forever ago

3913
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
yeah zone msn.com still exists

3914
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
I'm really surprised this isn't in the fold too

3915
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I mean these are like as casual as they get

3916
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
games though

3917
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
this is where you can play such winners as

3918
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
bubbles you play them in your sleep

3919
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
that's casual and patchworks

3920
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
and fishdom

3921
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
spooky splash

3922
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
but you can also play

3923
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
bejeweled 3 on there so it's

3924
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
pretty interesting I don't know

3925
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
but yeah there you go uh those games are now

3926
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
playable free on xbox.com

3927
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
maybe a sign of things to come

3928
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I don't know I bet people would be a lot more interested

3929
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
if you could earn achievements in those games

3930
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
and I'm totally serious when I say that by the way

3931
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
totally serious

3932
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
alright one more story till we get to list list tonight

3933
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Dark Sakura

3934
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
well how about

3935
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
something that

3936
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
I had to make sure that it wasn't a joke when I

3937
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
first saw it

3938
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
the com is announcing street fighter vs hello kitty

3939
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I'm not joking

3940
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
wait what?

3941
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
fall 2012 street fighter and hello kitty

3942
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
will have a single game together

3943
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
so I could like play as bats maru

3944
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
and like kick ihonda's ass

3945
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
I guess but they

3946
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
put up a picture of

3947
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
kitty dressed up as chun li

3948
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
it was like just a flash

3949
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
on the screen

3950
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
and uh

3951
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
there's nothing else you know really

3952
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
about it but the quote says

3953
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
that this is from Joshua Izzo

3954
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
who's the director of licensing with capcom

3955
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
capcom has long admired Sanrio

3956
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
and their ability to create memorable

3957
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
and cherished lifestyle brands so it is

3958
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
a distinct pleasure to partner with them for this

3959
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
new crossover line of merchandise

3960
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
so it looks like it's just merchandise really

3961
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
yeah it's just like handbags

3962
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
and wallets could you imagine them doing

3963
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
pocket fighter with Sanrio characters

3964
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
that would be weird

3965
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
that would be kind of weird but funny

3966
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
that's kind of cute

3967
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
I don't know like there's a part of me

3968
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
like when I first heard this story I was like

3969
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
no way are they making a game and then I heard it was

3970
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
the merchandising and I'm like that is really

3971
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
weird and I see the picture of hello kitty as chun

3972
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
li and I'm like what in the actual

3973
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
fuck is this and why do I still

3974
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
really want it? I want a bats maru

3975
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
done up as gulkey

3976
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I think bats maru would probably get the ryu

3977
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
treatment I think that's what I'm gonna see

3978
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
no dear daniel would you think? I think

3979
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
we'll see

3980
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
but I love this chun li kitty it's so adorable

3981
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I want that

3982
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
alright

3983
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
anyhow let's get to listless

3984
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I'm so excited we haven't done a

3985
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
game here on OLR in a long time so let's

3986
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
let's do listless

3987
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
tonight we are going to create the

3988
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
definitive list on a particular

3989
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
topic in gaming and

3990
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
here's the way that listless works we're gonna all

3991
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
go around in studio and I'm gonna bring on

3992
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
a guest on the phone here in a moment and we're

3993
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
each gonna bring up our list of three

3994
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
possible choices to put on

3995
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
the list but then the difficult part we all

3996
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
go around and eliminate one from

3997
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
the list that will leave us with a list of eight

3998
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
possible answers for the

3999
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
topic and then you guys

4000
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
in the chat room will get to vote on your number

4001
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
one and number two picks so our

4002
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
list combined with your votes create the

4003
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
definitive list

4004
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
for this topic and there's no argue this is a highly

4005
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
scientific process there's no arguing

4006
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
this is what the fans want

4007
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
alright so I bet you all are

4008
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
dying to know tonight's topic

4009
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
well earlier tonight we talked about

4010
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Freddy Krueger being in Mortal Kombat

4011
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
so now it's pretty clear that Mortal Kombat

4012
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
is clearly adding whatever character

4013
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
they want doesn't even have to be

4014
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
in the Mortal Kombat mythos

4015
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
so what character should

4016
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
be next

4017
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
that's right Mortal Kombat

4018
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
is adding characters so what character

4019
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
should be next let me bring on

4020
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
a fourth panelist tonight

4021
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
now I have to admit I was trying to get

4022
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Extifer tonight because

4023
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
it would have been fun and I know he plays the Mortal Kombat

4024
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
series but unfortunately he

4025
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
had to bow out so he's

4026
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
not going to be able to be on the show tonight he was getting

4027
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
his asshole bleached

4028
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
exactly exactly

4029
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
right so he couldn't join us

4030
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
but I got a substitute that

4031
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
tends to substitute for Extifer over

4032
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
on Horde House as well when needed so

4033
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
here

4034
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,000
here we go I'm going to give him a call right now

4035
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
one ringy dingy

4036
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
hopefully it rings I don't know

4037
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
here we go hello hello

4038
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
hey slices pop hey what's up

4039
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
hey not much welcome to Orange Laundry

4040
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
or welcome back rather

4041
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
and thanks for thinking how since I've moved

4042
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
up in here with you I'm sort of on the show

4043
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
less than when I was when I lived in the bay

4044
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
I know it's kind of but here you are you're back again

4045
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
tonight you're welcome to come over whenever you want

4046
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
filling in for Extifer sort of

4047
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
that's who I was trying to get for this segment tonight

4048
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
but just like on Horde House you are saving the day

4049
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
so I appreciate it

4050
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
now usually we have guests

4051
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
we usually have guests on here to plug

4052
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
websites or

4053
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
their own podcast

4054
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
is there anything you want to plug tonight?

4055
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
I was

4056
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
also the guest commentator

4057
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
on the most recent episode of

4058
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Horde House for WoW discussion if anyone cares

4059
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
about that but otherwise not really

4060
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
no I hate WoW and I hate Horde House it's a bad

4061
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
show

4062
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
you should probably stop producing it

4063
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
because you're one of the co-hosts

4064
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
alright let's get

4065
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
to tonight's list

4066
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
alright so you've already been briefed on the

4067
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
topic at hand so everybody here in studio

4068
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
should have their and on the phone should have their

4069
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
top three answers now that Mortal Combat

4070
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
is clearly adding whatever character they

4071
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
want what character should be next

4072
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
now we're also relying on those of you

4073
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
in chat to give your answers

4074
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
because if one of us has an item

4075
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
to get duplicated on the list or something

4076
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
where we don't want to say the same thing twice

4077
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
we often turn to chat to help us

4078
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
out so chat.orangelandradio.com

4079
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
if you want to give your opinions

4080
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
so let's start forming the list and we'll

4081
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
let ladies go first

4082
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
so DarkSakura what is your number three

4083
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
answer? What character should be in

4084
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Mortal Combat next?

4085
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Ash from

4086
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Evil Dead

4087
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Ash from Evil Dead?

4088
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Could you imagine how awesome that would be?

4089
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Weren't there always rumors

4090
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
of like an Ash versus Freddy versus

4091
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Jason movie? There was

4092
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
yeah and he actually did a comic

4093
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
of Army

4094
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
of Darkness versus Marvel Zombies

4095
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
and he was in it. Interesting

4096
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
yeah so

4097
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
not out of the entire realm of possibility

4098
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
of Ash being in a fight again. And you know Bruce

4099
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Campbell likes money. Yeah of course

4100
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
alright I'll go next

4101
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I'm going to say my number three answer is

4102
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Barney the purple dinosaur

4103
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
this is my number three answer

4104
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
because who doesn't want to

4105
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
perform a fatality on Barney?

4106
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
I love you

4107
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
you love me

4108
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
let's go and beat up Barney

4109
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
with a baseball bat

4110
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
we'll knock him to the floor

4111
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
no more purple dinosaur

4112
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
there you go I'll never sing again on this program

4113
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
ladies and gentlemen

4114
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Barney the purple dinosaur

4115
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
is he even on TV anymore?

4116
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
I think so

4117
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
alright

4118
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
are you a big fan of Barney Slice of Pop?

4119
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I have two half

4120
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
brothers that are significantly younger than me

4121
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
and they were toddlers during the

4122
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
early and mid 90s which was when

4123
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Barney the dinosaur ruled the fucking world

4124
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
so yeah my

4125
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
16 year old ass had to sit at home

4126
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
and watch those VHS tapes 20

4127
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
30 times in a day. So how do you feel

4128
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
how do you feel about Barney Immortal Combat?

4129
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
There's some trauma there. I think I

4130
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
could get out my

4131
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
PTSD my post-traumatic

4132
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
stress disorder by killing him

4133
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
in Mortal Combat from my teenage

4134
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
years I would be a fan of that

4135
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
alright awesome

4136
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Loki we'll go to you next. What's your number 3 answer?

4137
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
My number 3 answer

4138
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Colonel Sanders

4139
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Why the man from KFC?

4140
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
It would be hilarious. It reminds me of

4141
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Project Aco

4142
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
It's the Colonel

4143
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I love it

4144
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Alright

4145
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Slice of Pop, your number 3 answer

4146
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
This might be a little bit

4147
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
obscure but for those who remember

4148
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
the Spawn comic

4149
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Spawn from the 90s, Angela

4150
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Angela from Spawn

4151
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Oh

4152
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
She's got the

4153
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
TNA and she's got the brutality

4154
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
so I think she'd be a great fit

4155
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Slice of Pop taking it serious

4156
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I like this. Angela from the Spawn comics

4157
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
a very serious answer that I'm sure will not

4158
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
survive the elimination round but we'll see what happens

4159
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I'm just kidding. Tell us a little more about

4160
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Angela for those that aren't familiar with the comics

4161
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
and I didn't see that movie either

4162
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Uh

4163
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Spawn was a demon from hell

4164
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
after this alien sort of

4165
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
usurped Lucifer from hell

4166
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
and he was kind of, so Spawn was a demon

4167
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Angela was this badass angel

4168
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
from heaven except she would

4169
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
fucking kill you. She was you know brutal

4170
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
it wasn't a very feathers

4171
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
and wings and pretty choir

4172
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
angels with halos. She was

4173
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
she was really a

4174
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
force to be reckoned with so I

4175
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
definitely think she could kick some ass in Mortal Combat

4176
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Alright, excellent. Alright, let's see if

4177
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
it survives. We've got more to

4178
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
go though. Those are the number 3 answers

4179
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Ash from Evil Dead, Barney the Purple

4180
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Dinosaur, Colonel Sanders and Angela from the

4181
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Spawn comics. Let's go to the number 2s

4182
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Dark Soccer, your number 2 answer

4183
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Um, Pyramid Head

4184
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Pyramid Head

4185
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
from Silent Hill. Need I ask

4186
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
why? No you don't need to

4187
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
I could

4188
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
ask but then I might end up dead right?

4189
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
He's badass

4190
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
and that's actually a serious suggestion. Alright

4191
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
that's a good answer. Pyramid

4192
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Head is on the list there. I saw that in chat

4193
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
and actually when I saw it go by in chat

4194
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Zethur in chat suggested when I saw that I was like

4195
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
oh I'm taking that one if one of mine gets stolen

4196
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
but since now

4197
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
it's already on the list I'll use my original number

4198
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
2 answer which I'm sorry this

4199
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
would be badass and this should absolutely

4200
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
be in Mortal Kombat and

4201
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
who is a

4202
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
character? I'm going to ask this question

4203
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Who is a character more scary

4204
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
than Freddy Krueger and Jason

4205
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
combined? Who is the scariest

4206
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
fucking character ever in the history of ever?

4207
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
My mother pissed off? No

4208
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Pennywise the Clown

4209
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Oh my god

4210
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
And that's my number 2 answer. Pennywise

4211
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
the Clown. I am afraid of clowns

4212
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
and I really hate that clown

4213
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
So don't you want to kill one?

4214
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Well Shang Tsung turned into

4215
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Well you know Shang Tsung's clown fatality

4216
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
was supposed to be Joker's fatality

4217
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Oh wow

4218
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
In the DC vs. Mortal Kombat

4219
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
It was the fatality

4220
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
But

4221
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
No it was supposed to be they changed it

4222
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
No it's exactly the same as the fatality

4223
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
that Joker used in

4224
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Because he wasn't supposed to actually shoot him

4225
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Yeah well it goes off camera

4226
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Yeah it goes off camera but

4227
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
but you see the whole thing in

4228
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Mortal Kombat Alright

4229
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
So there you go. Pennywise the Clown from IT

4230
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Alright

4231
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Loki what's your number 2 answer?

4232
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
My number 2 answer is the most

4233
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
frightening thing beyond Pennywise

4234
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
the Clown

4235
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
that is just hit media

4236
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
all together and that would be Lady Gaga

4237
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
If anyone deserves to be torn apart

4238
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
as strange as fucking hell is Lady Gaga

4239
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Hey! Hey!

4240
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
You could do some Ermac and some Noob Saibot

4241
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
fucking crazy morphing shit with those costumes

4242
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
of hers You could it would be costume

4243
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
morphing and like her costumes would be like

4244
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
those bubble dresses would be filled

4245
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
with acid and shit like I would play as

4246
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Lady Gaga and I would beat your ass

4247
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I would shove a 9 inch

4248
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
stiletto in your characters eye

4249
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
For the record Becky said she jumped when you said Pennywise

4250
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
I'm telling you Pennywise is a scary

4251
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
mother fucker Alright there you go

4252
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Lady Gaga. Oh I love this

4253
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
DDR dollar villain chat suggests Pennywise

4254
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
turns into a giant spider for a fatality

4255
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
That's good

4256
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Alright

4257
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Uh, Salacious Pop it's over to you

4258
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
What's your number 2 answer?

4259
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
So the key question to this list list

4260
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
is characters

4261
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
and not people so

4262
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
I'm saying Rose mother fucking Nylund

4263
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
from the Golden Girls

4264
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Betty White

4265
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Rose Nylund

4266
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Rose Nylund

4267
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
She'll kill you

4268
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
And

4269
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
what would Rose Nylund's fatality be

4270
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
would it be a story from St. Olaf

4271
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Yes she'd tell us St. Olaf story

4272
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
and you would take a shotgun and you would kill yourself

4273
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Alright

4274
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I always

4275
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Hey I always wanted my

4276
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Golden Girls game that was Grandma Got Guns

4277
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
and it was about the Golden Girls just going on

4278
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
a rampage to save their retirement

4279
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
home or whatever. Alright so Rose Nylund

4280
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
is uh

4281
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Salacious Pop's number 2 answer. Alright here it is

4282
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
time for the number 1 answers

4283
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
and we're gonna go around and get them

4284
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Let me read the list so far

4285
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Ash from Evil Dead, Barney the Purple Dinosaur

4286
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Colonel Sanders, Angela from Spawn, Pyramid Head

4287
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Pennywise the Clown from IT

4288
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Lady Gaga and Rose Nylund

4289
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
who is of course Betty White from the Golden Girls

4290
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Alright so now it's time to get the number 1

4291
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
answers. Dark Sakura

4292
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I went serious with all my answers you know

4293
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
I picked Sera Pizzini

4294
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Witchblade

4295
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
You gotta spell that last name for me

4296
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
I was thinking of her

4297
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
when Rob told me what Luke was

4298
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
ZZINI

4299
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Okay P-I-Z-Z-I-N-I I don't know this character

4300
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
either you gotta explain this to me a little bit

4301
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
The Witchblade basically is like this

4302
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
gauntlet that's stuck on one hand but it

4303
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
will turn into any weapons and the armor

4304
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
so she's like wearing like this big metal ball

4305
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
but she's all coated in the weapon

4306
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Alright

4307
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
I think the Elts got like half of it and now there's

4308
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
a new Witchblade and I kind of got

4309
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
out of it around then but there was also

4310
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
a cool

4311
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Battle of the Planets crossover where

4312
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
and keep in mind

4313
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
I know all the Gachamon names so I think in

4314
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Battle of the Planet it's just called Princess

4315
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Whoever Jun the Swan was in Gachamon

4316
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
She got the Witchblade so it was a

4317
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
neat kind of crossover but other than that

4318
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
you know I think that

4319
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
I just always liked the character so

4320
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
she'd be badass

4321
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
I'm gonna get to my number one answer

4322
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
My number one answer is also a very serious answer

4323
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
like I really think and Salacious Pop might be mad

4324
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
at me because I have a feeling this could be who he's thinking

4325
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
too so I apologize in advance

4326
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
if this is your answer Salacious Pop but I have to say

4327
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
a character I would honestly love to see

4328
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
in Mortal Kombat that would kick a lot of ass

4329
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
would be Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill

4330
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Hell yeah!

4331
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
That was of course

4332
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Uma Thermos character in Kill Bill

4333
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Was that your answer Salacious Pop?

4334
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Well um I was gonna

4335
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
say uh

4336
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
she's the best character

4337
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
in the whole thing and I can't

4338
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Daryl Hannah who did she play?

4339
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Oh um

4340
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Black Mamba

4341
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
No Black Mamba was Beatrix

4342
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
She was California

4343
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
King Snake but the character was

4344
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
L Driver

4345
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Was that your number one really?

4346
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
No no I was going to but I'm gonna switch something else now

4347
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
because Beatrix is better

4348
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Alright so there it is Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill

4349
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
How could I not? I'm just like

4350
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
my god she kicks so much ass

4351
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
I would hate to see her die but at the same time

4352
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
she's gonna just chop bitches arms off and so forth

4353
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
so there you go Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill

4354
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
is my number one answer

4355
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Loki your number one answer

4356
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
My number one answer

4357
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
unfortunately he is

4358
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
he has passed but uh

4359
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Billy Mays

4360
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Billy Mays hi guys

4361
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Billy Mays here

4362
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Would he actually show off something

4363
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
in his infomercial before killing you with it?

4364
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
He would throw OxiClean on you

4365
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
He would die

4366
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
He would spray you with OxiClean and then start

4367
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
scrubbing away until your face came off

4368
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
There you go there you go

4369
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Alright Billy Mays

4370
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
I could use the Kaboom or whatever

4371
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Alright so SlaciousPop it's down to you

4372
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Eleven on the list so far

4373
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000

4374
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000

4375
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000

4376
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Mr. Rogers

4377
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Mr. Rogers

4378
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Are you inspired by the ultimate battle of ultimate destiny?

4379
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
From Mr. Rogers neighborhood

02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Was that a yes?

4381
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000

4383
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
So why Mr. Rogers?

4384
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
No one is that nice

4385
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
You gotta have a dark vibe

4386
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
He actually was really that nice in person

4387
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000

I almost thought about Voldemort but

4438
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
I'm surprised no one said Amy Winehouse I mean that would be

4439
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Actually I changed Amy Winehouse to Michael Jackson

4440
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Oh there you go

4441
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000

4453
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
let's see

4454
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
trying to look quickly through

4455
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Elmer Fudd

4456
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
seriously says Legend of Zaku

4457
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Tigerclaw says how about the Queen

02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Alien from Aliens

4459
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
uh there's a few people saying Pikachu

4460
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Laha says Pikachu

4461
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Pikachu

4462
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
so they go oh and uh Jovidea says Ronald McDonald

4463
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
there you go alright

4464
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
so

4465
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
now is the time where we eliminate things from

4466
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
the list I know this is going to be very difficult but unfortunately

4467
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
some items are going to have to come

4468
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
off the list so here we go

4469
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
insulation pop I posted it to you in a

4470
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
private message so you can follow along here

4471
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
um Dark Sakura

4472
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
this is hard these are all good answers tonight

4473
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
we don't often have this in list list

4474
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
usually like there's a couple shitty ones on there but these are

4475
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
all good but unfortunately

4476
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
this is a scientific process and for the scientific

4477
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
process to continue something

4478
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
must come off the list Dark Sakura which of these

4479
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
is not worthy of the list I would have to say

4480
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Barney because I find him even more

4481
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
traumatic than anything else in the

4482
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
universe and just I wouldn't

4483
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
be able to fight him because I would have to pause

4484
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
the game and go throw up alright Barney

4485
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
the purple dinosaur has been stricken from the list

4486
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
uh I am going to remove

4487
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
I'm sorry I do think this is a great idea

4488
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
but it's just a little too crazy

4489
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
I'm taking Billy Mays off the list

4490
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Billy Mays is not worthy of the list so it has been stricken

4491
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
from the list Loki which of these is not

4492
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
worthy of the list?

4493
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
unfortunately it's not the

4494
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
golden girl I would have picked so

4495
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Rose Nylund has to be removed off the list

4496
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Bea Arthur was a close second

4497
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Bea Arthur is a bad ass bitch

4498
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
you should have just went with Maude

4499
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
and then there's Maude

4500
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I have to

4501
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
share this with you do you ever watch the

4502
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Deadpool PSAs? No

4503
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Deadpool had a minor obsession

4504
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
with Bea Arthur, ok a major obsession with Bea Arthur

4505
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
and it had a poster in the

4506
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
the thing that said don't you wish your girlfriend was

4507
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
hot like Bea

4508
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
yes alright

4509
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
so Rose Nylund has been stricken from the list

4510
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
so nine items

4511
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
remain Salacious Pop it comes down to you

4512
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
one of these must come off the list for us to proceed

4513
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
which of these is not worthy of the list Salacious Pop?

4514
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Pennywise the

4515
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
clown

4516
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
why that was the best answer on there

4517
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
and I'm saying that because I'm totally biased

4518
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
why are you getting rid of Pennywise?

4519
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Warner Brothers ain't trying to bring class action

4520
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
lawsuits at people just you know

4521
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
being terrified at this game

4522
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
cause that's some traumatic shit

4523
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
however wouldn't it have been cool to actually get Tim Curry to voice him

4524
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
I know right

4525
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
or just have Tim Curry

4526
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I'm so angry

4527
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Frank should be in it

4528
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Frank and Porter should be in it instead

4529
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
I'm so angry

4530
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000

02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
how awesome it would be if Ash was in

4533
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Mortal Kombat his little intro animation

4534
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
would be him showing up and saying okay

02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000

4548
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000

4549
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000

4578
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
I'm being egged on

4579
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
to retaliate by someone and I won't say who

4580
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000

4581
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000

02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000

02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000

4591
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000

4592
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
want to plug like your Twitter or anything like that

4593
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
I don't know if you do writing online or whatever that you want to plug

4594
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
I just want to say that don't

4595
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
worry you'll float we all float down

4596
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000

02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
bye

4600
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
alright

4601
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
while those votes come in let's get back

4602
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
into some other gaming news and we're going to

4603
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
go over to Loki

4604
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
with some news about GameCube games

4605
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
yes apparently Nintendo director of

4606
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
entertainment and trend marketing Amber

4607
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
McCollum

4608
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
was quoted

4609
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
during an interview with

4610
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Nintendo Gal on the subject

4611
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
of GameCube games not being playable on the upcoming

4612
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Wii U

4613
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
McCollum said GameCube disc

4614
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
will not be compatible with the Wii U

4615
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
but a number of games that were

4616
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
playable on the GameCube can be downloaded

4617
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
from WiiWare

4618
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
and people were like really

4619
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
is that going to be possible

4620
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
are you going to be able to download games

4621
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
via some sort of storage device

4622
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
or something like that

4623
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
of course when asked to clarify

4624
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
that statement

4625
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
they went and said to clarify the

4626
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
capabilities of the Wii U system

4627
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
as correctly stated the Wii U will not be able to

4628
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
play Nintendo GameCube disc

4629
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
however Nintendo has not made any announcement

4630
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
regarding download content so they kind of

4631
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
back stepped a little bit but it sounds

4632
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
like that maybe that's something

4633
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
that they're going to be working towards

4634
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
is having GameCube games downloadable

4635
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
do you think that will really happen

4636
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
because it would seem to be like the

4637
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
GameCube games are kind of large but then again

4638
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
we have Xbox 360 games and so forth

4639
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
I'm not sure if they would do that

4640
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I think if anything they would just re-release

4641
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
GameCube games or touch

4642
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
them up somewhat and

4643
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
re-release them on like they were doing

4644
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
the new play control stuff where it was on a Wii disc

4645
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
but it was a GameCube game I could see more

4646
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
of that happening right

4647
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
because it gives them an excuse to charge more money

4648
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
and I would gladly pay for

4649
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
F-Zero GX all over again though to be honest

4650
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
I'm not even going to lie like take my money

4651
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
I would gladly pay you tomorrow for a hamburger

4652
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
today you be quiet

4653
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
alright moving on

4654
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
to a story about iRAM

4655
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
do you know the company iRAM have you ever heard of iRAM?

4656
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Breaking R-Type! Hello! That's right they made R-Type

4657
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
they made a lot of other interesting games too

4658
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
but here's the deal

4659
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
R-Type there's a few of these games on the PSP

4660
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
like there's R-Type Tactics on the PSP

4661
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
R-Type Tactics 2

4662
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
there's also the game Archives have

4663
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
R-Types and R-Types Delta these are all over the

4664
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Playstation Network and Playstation Go

4665
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
well guess what? Come August 11

4666
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
these games are going away

4667
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
iRAM is taking their catalog off of the

4668
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Playstation Network and

4669
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
the same thing goes for their specific Playstation

4670
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
home lounges

4671
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
they had some like I guess 9 lounges

4672
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
that were about these games

4673
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
they are all going away

4674
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
I guess the Doki Doki Suikoden

4675
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
lounge is the only one that's staying

4676
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
I don't know

4677
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
so yeah iRAM has not said why

4678
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
they're going away but these games

4679
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
on PSP are no longer going to be available

4680
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
now a lot of these I've never heard of

4681
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
there's games like these are all very

4682
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Japanese titles

4683
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
2 based on cartoon cone

4684
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
bumpy trot beagle battle tournament

4685
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
these are all games that are downloadable right now

4686
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
on Playstation Network they are going to be going away

4687
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
on August 11th I wonder if this is

4688
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
some type of retaliation

4689
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
so to speak for the PSN being down

4690
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
for so long

4691
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
I don't know nah it's probably just licensing

4692
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
coming up and they decided not to renew it

4693
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
or something gotcha

4694
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
alright well there you go

4695
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
they are coming off of Playstation Network

4696
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
so enjoy them while you can not like I can't bust

4697
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
out you know the master system

4698
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
and play art type the original system right

4699
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
yeah alright let's go to the mailbag

4700
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000

4701
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000

4703
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
mailbag head first and pulls out some of her favorite

4704

4711
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
greetings OLR thanks

4712
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
for helping my commute to work a more pleasant one

4713
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
with your podcast I really

4714
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
find this debate of online passes and used

4715
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
games quite interesting a long time gamer like

4716
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
yourselves I actually

4717
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
I am actually quite indifferent about

4718
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
this tactic I do buy most of my games

4719
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
new like Rob though I do dabble

4720
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
in the occasional used title here and there as well

4721
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
while I am not foolish enough to believe that

4722
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
every used game equals a lost new game

4723
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
sale it would be equally foolish to

4724
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
assume that new game sales aren't somewhat

4725
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
hurt by the used game market

4726
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
frankly I don't buy the whole spin about

4727
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
online passes being for servers or what not

4728
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
it's simply a way to be able to

4729
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
get a piece of the used game market for publishers

4730
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
that being said I have no problem

4731
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
with that being a pitfall of buying a

4732
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
used game everything is included

4733
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
with a new purchase so I will

4734
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
always have and

4735
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
more often than not choose that

4736
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
option the harsh reality is

4737
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
that game makers and publishers

4738
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
owe nothing to used game purchasers because it

4739
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
doesn't make them any money directly

4740
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
I know that this

4741
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
slippery slope argument exists

4742
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
at the same time I give consumers more credit

4743
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
than Loki may that they can look at each

4744
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
issue on a case by case basis and reject

4745
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
ideas that they feel cross the line

4746
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
I have often wondered if there could be

4747
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
a moratorium on used game sales

4748
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
placed for maybe 3 or 6 months

4749
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
so that new games aren't hindered by used

4750
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
game sales at the end of the day

4751
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
both used games and new games have their place

4752
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
for now and I can't begrudge anyone

4753
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
for choosing what solution works for them

4754
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
thanks to all of you darkcharger

4755
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
PS if the show is interested in

4756
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
a new copy of Adobe Lightroom 3

4757
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
yes

4758
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Jamie is

4759
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
yes email

4760
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
me and I will send it to you as a gift

4761
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
thanks again for the podcast I wish that

4762
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
I could listen live more often

4763
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
yes

4764
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
saved

4765
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
I think

4766
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
the idea is interesting about the whole moratorium

4767
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
but I just don't think it's possible

4768
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
because you'd be telling people they can't

4769
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
sell their own new product

4770
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
like what's to stop me from

4771
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
going to my neighbor saying oh yeah you want this game

4772
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
I don't really play it here give me 40 bucks

4773
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
it would never happen because you're basically telling people

4774
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
that when they're done with their game that they can't trade it

4775
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
back into I mean okay let's say that they're able

4776
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
to sell it back to GameStop but GameStop's not gonna sell

4777
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
they're not gonna sit on a bunch of

4778
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
product that's gonna be devaluing

4779
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
you know over time especially when they're

4780
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
taking trades in on games you know to

4781
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
see that's the thing

4782
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
is they use game sales

4783
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
it gets people to trade in their games

4784
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
to like a GameStop or something like that so they

4785
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
buy those new games that you

4786
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
want them to buy

4787
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
but now if you take that money source

4788
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
away I guess of them

4789
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
if you basically ban used game

4790
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
sales or make it not very

4791
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
pretty to the fact that

4792
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
it devalues the used game

4793
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
then they're not gonna have money to

4794
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
buy that new game that you want

4795
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
to buy so you see you're in turn

4796
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
hurting yourself

4797
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
but they won't figure that out until

4798
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
everyone jumps on board with this type of

4799
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
you know scheme

4800
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
and then it affects them down

4801
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
the line and they're like ah crap

4802
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
why did we do that?

4803
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
You know and I'm kind of

4804
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
in the boat as this guy I mean he already said he's

4805
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
kind of like me where you either buy it new or you don't buy it

4806
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
and especially considering what I talked about at the

4807
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
top of the show as in one particular store I will

4808
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
not be shopping at anymore for new or used games

4809
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
I mean there's your biggest used market right

4810
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
there but not

4811
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
to say I would never buy a game used I mean there's

4812
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
obviously other people trying to get in that market as well

4813
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
but honestly I find now

4814
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
by the time I want to go back

4815
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
and get an old game and

4816
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
I'd be actually looking for it used cause you usually can't

4817
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
find the new game used it's so hard

4818
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
to get it like I think the last

4819
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
new game that I bought used was the Tron

4820
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
game and I

4821
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
the minute I played it I could see why somebody sold it

4822
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
back right away so usually

4823
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
you know if a game's really that good you can't

4824
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
find it used right away

4825
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
we go buy used games though fairly

4826
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
regularly but that's just

4827
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
because we might want to finish a collection

4828
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
but I think at this point if I did want to

4829
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
go get a used game I would just check the price on

4830
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Amazon or you know other competing

4831
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
internet websites like Best Buy or whatever

4832
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
and see what the price is and if it's

4833
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
good enough I'll just buy it online

4834
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
so

4835
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
until one of those stores pisses me off

4836
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
then I'll stop shopping there too

4837
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
alright next email

4838
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
hello olr

4839
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
here's an orange lounge foodie-o question

4840
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
but it does relate to a video game do you think

4841
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
dominos will ever bring back the noid

4842
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
we need a new yo noid

4843
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
game dammit

4844
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
brought to you by sizzler

4845
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
home of the 3 day old salad bar that tastes like shit

4846
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
and gives you the shit the squits

4847
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
that's from chiggers

4848
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
who by the way did get his name from where you thought

4849
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
ewww

4850
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
he said he had it as a kid or something like that

4851
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
and that's where he got his name

4852
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
I either

4853
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
he emailed horde house about that or I ran into him

4854
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
on wow and we brought that up

4855
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
let's see

4856
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
do I think dominos would ever bring back the noid

4857
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
no dominos did this really interesting

4858
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
thing where they kind of came out and admitted that their pizza

4859
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
tastes like shit and that they're going to totally

4860
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
redo it like it was this very interesting

4861
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
campaign that they did and it worked

4862
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
like dominos sales have been up quite a bit

4863
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
in the past year or so people like that

4864
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
self deprecating sense of humor and I think

4865
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
because of that because dominos is trying to distance

4866
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
themselves from the past you're not going to see the

4867
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
noid ever come back I think the noid is something that's very

4868
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
80's well never

4869
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
say never but you're not going to see it in the next

4870
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
5 years no so

4871
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
sadly that would mean the same for the yo noid

4872
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
game here's a question for you guys though

4873
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
do you think we'll see any other like

4874
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
commercial product video games

4875
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
again because we used to get these all the time

4876
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
back in the day like there was the mick kids game

4877
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
the california raisins game

4878
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
where the hell is my damn

4879
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
burger king connect games were the most

4880
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
recent ones they're supposed to have the burger king connect

4881
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
game and they never fucking put it out

4882
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
I don't know so we'll see

4883
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
and now

4884
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
burger king's all over transformers but no games

4885
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
about chiggers

4886
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
transformers all hasbro

4887
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
the end no I'm kidding how about

4888
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
another email yes another email

4889
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
yes okay

4890
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
I'm a few shows behind in my listening but

4891
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
I just want to respond to Rob with his

4892
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
opinion that college is a waste of money and you

4893
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
learn better by doing I 100%

4894
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
agree I spent 5 years in

4895
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
college earned 2 bachelors degree television

4896
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
production and asian studies graduated

4897
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
summa cum laude in the top 10%

4898
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
of my class I can be quoted

4899
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
as saying frequently that the only good thing that

4900
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
I got back from college was a husband

4901
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
aside from being an abstract requirement

4902
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
BK have

4903
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
a BA when we don't care which one

4904
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
nobody cares about all the painstaking

4905
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
work I did in college I haven't touched editing software

4906
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
since I left I haven't spoken Japanese Chinese

4907
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
or Spanish since I left

4908
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
all of the hard earned knowledge has faded away

4909
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
and the reality is set in unless you're going to be

4910
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
a doctor lawyer or something that requires daily

4911
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
use of the knowledge you got in college it's

4912
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
ultimately a costly waste of time

4913
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
the job I have now has

4914
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
diddly to do with my fancy degrees and I'm still

4915
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
paying on the $2,000 I have

4916
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
left in college bills when I have kids

4917
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
they're going to trade school and learn to be plumbers

4918
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
or HVAC technicians or car mechanics

4919
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
and at

4920
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
least then I will be secure in the knowledge that

4921
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
what they've learned is useful and the

4922
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
very least will save them money because they can fix

4923
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
their own stuff Holly V

4924
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
now I do have to say though

4925
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
in the design field like

4926
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
what I'm in college

4927
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
college ends up being useful

4928
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
because the classes that I take have

4929
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
practical application for what

4930
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
I'm doing I've built my

4931
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
portfolio I've marketed myself

4932
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
I'm already getting work and I

4933
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
haven't finished college so I'm just

4934
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
saying well and I want to be careful too I don't want to become

4935
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
like this anti-college spokesperson because I wasn't

4936
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
quite the point of my rant but I think what

4937
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
I was meaning to get at is that it's not for everyone

4938
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
and I think some people kind of

4939
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
feel like there's this necessity like

4940
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
I have to go I have to go and you

4941
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
maybe you don't you know that's all

4942
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
I'm kind of saying and you know will I ever go

4943
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
back someday and finish maybe

4944
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
but right now for the career that I'm doing

4945
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
I would be better off spending my time getting

4946
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
certifications and licenses and

4947
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
things from organizations that support

4948
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
my industry and not really a state school

4949
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
I hate to say it but that's

4950
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
where my

4951
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
enrichment is going to come from now let me put it this way

4952
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
college isn't for everyone but it might be for

4953
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
you and your field and whatever you're doing

4954
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
and here's my honest advice if you are going to go to

4955
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
college here's the mistake not to make

4956
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
make sure you don't do

4957
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
nothing but school

4958
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
okay if you're going to go to college

4959
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
make sure you do some extracurricular activities

4960
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
make sure you do internships

4961
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
oh my god take I mean

4962
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
I know it might sound ludicrous like I gotta do something and don't

4963
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
get paid but the networking and experience

4964
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
you're going to get from that are going to mean so

4965
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
much more than your

4966
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
A's and B's I'm serious

4967
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
also make friends with your teachers

4968
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
who are working in the field

4969
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
yeah you're not in high school anymore it's not

4970
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
cool to hate your teachers well I mean

4971
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
keep in mind now I'm in school to be

4972
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
a graphic designer which was

4973
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
funny because I learned a lot of the programs

4974
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
and stuff on my own but

4975
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
I have picked up so much

4976
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
in design technique and in theory

4977
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
and just in studying

4978
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
you know I

4979
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
the best classes I've taken are my two

4980
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
art history classes and my typography

4981
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
class those have been my favorite so far

4982
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
that and my portfolio class

4983
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
which you've seen my portfolio

4984
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
it came out fully

4985
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
interview ready

4986
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
I've got my portfolio online if anyone wants to see my

4987
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
stuff just let me know and I will show you

4988
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
and then hire me please

4989
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
I will say this too you might be surprised

4990
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
to hear me say this but I actually think it also

4991
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
would be a good use of your time if this is

4992
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
a scene you are into and if this is something you are

4993
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
into join a fraternity or a sorority

4994
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
that definitely was not the

4995
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
scene for me but you know what

4996
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
for some people I know that have been in that scene it has

4997
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
been an

4998
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
immensely helpful networking tool

4999
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
like immensely helpful

5000
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
networking tool you would be like those are connections

5001
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
you're going to have for life so it's

5002
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
been very rewarding for some people I know so

5003
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
you know but it's not

5004
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
for everyone either and it's really

5005
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
about finding the right one for

5006
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
you is a huge challenge

5007
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
well and also find

5008
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
different clubs or online

5009
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
groups that people

5010
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
in your field are going to like

5011
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
you know if you're in engineering look for stuff

5012
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
through the department of engineers you know that type

5013
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
of stuff and if you're going to go to college

5014
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
just to drink do yourself and do

5015
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
the college a favor and don't go to college

5016
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
or at least get a liberal arts degree

5017
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
no not even that I'm just going to say

5018
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
do yourself a favor and don't go to college

5019
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
like you will be wasting money

5020
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
you'll be wasting time

5021
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
one thing about college though that I will say

5022
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
is that

5023
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
it gives you a chance to experiment

5024
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
with new ideas and

5025
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
to pick

5026
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
different things because I've changed my

5027
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
major like nine times before I finally just

5028
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
decided to go with what I loved anyway

5029
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
because I started off

5030
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
as a forensic geology major

5031
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
did you know that? I studied

5032
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
rocks for blood

5033
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
it was boring

5034
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
as fuck

5035
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
and then I changed my major so many times

5036
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
and finally decided to stick with

5037
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
art with something in the art field

5038
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
I hate doing illustration for other people

5039
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
because it's not my drawings anymore

5040
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
but I love doing design for other people

5041
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
and I've developed a passion

5042
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
for it but I wouldn't have known that

5043
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
design was where my heart was

5044
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
until

5045
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
I tried to do illustration and

5046
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
I tried to do all this other stuff and eventually

5047
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
I found the right path

5048
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
by, and I even found out that

5049
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
specifically print is my passion

5050
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
and I would never have known that

5051
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
if I had not taken typography

5052
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
right then and there, if I had not taken the

5053
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
InDesign class, so I'm just saying

5054
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
as an example, school

5055
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
is a good place to experiment

5056
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
without

5057
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
getting a job that you're going to hate

5058
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
you know what I mean? So

5059
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
I'm not going to continue my

5060
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
rant, I said what I said a couple

5061
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
shows ago and I stand by that

5062
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
you know, but yeah

5063
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
it's not for everyone, but it might be for you

5064
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
and that's okay. It's your money

5065
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
spend it how you want to spend it

5066
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Next email

5067
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
Hi OLR crew, this is your

5068
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
friendly neighborhood Mexican act Deft

5069
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
I'm pretty sure you have already talked and discussed

5070
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
about Capcom this week, but I want to vent a little

5071
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
and share my two cents on their most recent happenings

5072
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Well needless to say, as many people

5073
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
have probably said now, I

5074
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
pretty much lost all faith in Capcom

5075
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Was it because of the release of

5076
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3? No

5077
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
I actually think, I actually

5078
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
was pretty excited about

5079
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
especially because of the addition of Phoenix Wright

5080
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Yeah granted, they're doing an update to a game not even

5081
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
nine months after release of the first edition

5082
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Capcom has always done this kind of stuff

5083
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
with all their fighting series and

5084
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
I've learned to accept it. If you know Capcom

5085
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
then you pretty much expect it to do so

5086
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
which by the way, that actually did remind

5087
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
me of something

5088
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
when they did

5089
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
all the different matching service

5090
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
and different versions of Street Fighter 3 like

5091
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Second Strike and Third Impact

5092
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
That's the same thing

5093
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Anyway, so why have I lost my confidence

5094
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
in Capcom? It's because of all their

5095
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
recent decisions as a company

5096
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
and there's a lot of things that I can name

5097
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
or list here. Unnecessary DRM

5098
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Mercenaries 3DS, Bionic Commando

5099
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Rearm 2, Super Street Fighter

5100
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
4, Arcade Edition

5101
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
The Cancellation of Games, Mega Man

5102
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Universe, Unnecessary Reboots, Devil May Cry

5103
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
No localizations of games

5104
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
people truly want, No Word on Monster Hunter

5105
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
nor Ace Attorney Investigations 2 being localized

5106
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Little by little, Capcom has

5107
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
done really bad decisions

5108
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
that have really affected the fans

5109
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
A company that was recently known

5110
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
to cater to the fans and still even now

5111
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
they kind of do it, is losing a lot of stuff

5112
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
that have their fans

5113
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
really angry, including me

5114
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
and I think the straw that broke the camel was

5115
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
the cancellation of Mega Man Legends 3

5116
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
People have wanted that game for so long

5117
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
and they just took it from them like

5118
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
if nothing happened. And with this

5119
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
also comes the slow killing

5120
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
of Mega Man. Mega Man X was the most

5121
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
wanted for MVC 3

5122
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
and they didn't mention him being an ultimate

5123
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
All of those things they've done

5124
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
little by little have created a really

5125
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
big ball of shit and they can't hide it now

5126
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
and even if they do, the stink is so big

5127
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
people will be reminded because of it

5128
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
Capcom has created their own demise and unless

5129
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
they do something to fix this problem, or at least

5130
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
they admit they do have a problem

5131
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
I won't be buying any game they release anytime

5132
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
soon. And I mean it, not even

5133
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
the Darkstalkers teaser they showed in their

5134
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Street Fighter X Tekken panel

5135
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
Oh yeah, that hasn't even come up in the show yet

5136
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
but yeah. A game I have wanted

5137
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
to make, I've wanted them to make

5138
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
for a long time

5139
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
won't blind me of all they have done to lose

5140
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
me as a fan. As Zekeman said in his

5141
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Tumblr and Twitter, Capcom, it's not me, it's you

5142
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Thanks for reading this

5143
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
and for keep on giving gamers a voice

5144
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
Act deft

5145
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
Last email? I'm curious to see

5146
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
how long that holds, and I'm not trying to be like

5147
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
a jerk about it, but you know, usually this

5148
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
internet rage, and then they'll announce something

5149
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
you just have to have

5150
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
But um, you know, obviously Capcom

5151
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
surprisingly went from

5152
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
all the fans love them and have very

5153
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
loyal fans, to literally within the scope

5154
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
of two weeks, have become

5155
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
like, quote, the

5156
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Japanese Bobby Kotek, you know

5157
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
what I mean? Like, it's just interesting

5158
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
My How the Mighty Have Fallen

5159
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
And uh, yeah, I

5160
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
I just think the way Capcom cancelled it too

5161
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
didn't help. And it's

5162
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
it sucks that they said, hey, let's

5163
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
involve this community, our hardcore fans

5164
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
in a game, and then tell them the game isn't good enough

5165
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
It's essentially what they did, that's

5166
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
that's tough. That's a tough pill to swallow

5167
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
Anyhow

5168
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Um, last email?

5169
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
Yep. Hi, OLR

5170
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
Just wanted to write in after the last few

5171
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
weeks, comments from Capcom's David Reeves

5172
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
I, I was more than

5173
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
a little miffed at what he said

5174
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
This coming from the same guy who used to

5175
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
run Sony of Europe, and said that when

5176
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
the PS3 was launching, that we have

5177
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
built up a certain brand equity

5178
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
over time, since the launch of

5179
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Playstation in 1995 and PS2 in 2000

5180
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
The first five million are going to buy it

5181
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
whatever it is, even if it doesn't

5182
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
have games. And then he linked

5183
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
to the full article, uh, interview

5184
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
Anyway, I'm not going to rant, so I'll be off

5185
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Catastrophic Moggy

5186
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
I don't like that, Catastrophic Moggy

5187
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
Yeah

5188
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
It's kind of dickly

5189
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Not, not muggy, but

5190
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
all the stuff

5191
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Oh, that's not the interview

5192
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Sorry, I'm reading over your shoulder here

5193
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Yeah, this is the interview

5194
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
It's a pretty long one, but

5195
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
Like, one of the questions

5196
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Um, are you confident in your

5197
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
approach and the inevitable buildup to

5198
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
November's launch hype? And he says

5199
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
without being too arrogant, I don't think we

5200
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
worry too much about building up the hype in the

5201
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
first six months, because when the rubber hits

5202
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
the road is going to be when all those hardcore

5203
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
gamers have bought PS3s

5204
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
They have also bought Xbox 360s and they

5205
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
probably bought Nintendo Wii as well

5206
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
So basically, you know

5207
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
There's a lot that haven't, though

5208
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
There's a lot of people that only adopt one of

5209
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
those systems, you know?

5210
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
I don't know

5211
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
That guy says a lot of very interesting things

5212
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Alright, that's going to do it for email tonight

5213
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

5214
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
if you want to send us an email for a future week

5215
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
In the meantime, I believe it's time

5216
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
to get the ranting on

5217
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
in a segment we call the FUs of the Week

5218
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
Let's go to the FUs of the Week right now

5219
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Music

5220
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:18,000
An FU to the bee sting I got on my neck

5221
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:22,000
And the stinger didn't break the skin

5222
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Well, it broke the skin, but not like

5223
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
it didn't get stuck in there

5224
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
But it is enough

5225
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
I'm allergic to bees

5226
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
So it's enough that it's

5227
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
pretty bad

5228
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
I also got another, I got a scrape from the stinger

5229
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
on my leg from a dead bee in the pool

5230
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
And that thankfully didn't swell up

5231
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
But I got another one and I have no idea when I got it

5232
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
It was just

5233
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
I felt it, and that was it

5234
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
Uh, go ahead Logie

5235
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Um, FU to uh

5236
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:56,000
I guess I'm not agreeing so far away

5237
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
Alright

5238
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
And my FU goes to um

5239
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
a couple things tonight, FU to Johnny Rockets

5240
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
because I went there to eat the other day and it took like

5241
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
25 minutes to get our food

5242
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
Uh, and it wasn't even busy

5243
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
But, and also FU to them because once the food finally

5244
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
did fucking come, the burgers I had were fucking delicious

5245
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
There were sliders, that's why I said burgers

5246
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
I'm not that fat

5247
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Those sliders are fucking good

5248
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Have you had the orange

5249
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
was it the orange dreamsicle shake

5250
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
No, no

5251
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
Like I'm actually trying to lose weight

5252
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
right now, so Johnny

5253
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
I had to cut back on something

5254
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
No, no, you should not cut back on the orange dreamsicle shake

5255
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
That is delicious

5256
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Oh, I, uh, yeah, so FU

5257
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Yeah, and FU to the fact that they derailed my diet

5258
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
because that food is so delicious

5259
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
Well, I don't know which Johnny Rockets you went to, but they have one

5260
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
I'll say Arden Fairmaul

5261
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
Well, they have a new one now that's across from the new

5262
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Palladio theaters

5263
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Oh, okay

5264
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Uh, yeah, I bet they didn't take

5265
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Well, see, if it took, like, if the place

5266
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
was packed and busy, then I would understand why it would take so long

5267
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
It was, like, empty, it was weird

5268
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
So, anyway, FU did that

5269
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
And FU did those burgers being delicious and making me want to go through that torture

5270
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
again just to have them and screw up my diet

5271
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
I've lost ten pounds in three months, almost

5272
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
Nine pounds in three months

5273
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Get a bicycle and go riding with me

5274
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
We live too far apart

5275
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
to do that every day, especially this time of year

5276
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
Alright, uh, and then

5277
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
Oh, the other FU, I have one more FU

5278
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
And then FU goes to, um, Salacious Pop

5279
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Not only for eliminating Pennywise from the list

5280
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
But we went to the casino last night

5281
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
I lost $20

5282
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
This bitch puts, like, $5

5283
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
in the slot machine and on his second pull

5284
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
wins $70

5285
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
Did he buy you dinner?

5286
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
No!

5287
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
But he did buy all the stuff at Target earlier that day

5288
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
so I can't complain, I can't complain

5289
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
He bought me a Hummingbird feeder because I wanted one

5290
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
That's awesome

5291
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
I know, I know

5292
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
I know, at the end of the day

5293
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
But I was really mad at the moment

5294
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Not really, though

5295
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
Did you stomp your little foot?

5296
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
I wasn't mad that he won, I was mad that I lost

5297
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
and he won on his second pull

5298
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
You should see how fast I went through $20

5299
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
He was just gone in a snap, and then he's like

5300
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
Oh, I think I'm winning, like, all this money

5301
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
The coin thing keeps going

5302
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
Do I get to keep all this?

5303
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:12,000
Now you see why I don't like to gamble

5304
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
Oh, I still love to gamble

5305
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
I don't even play the lottery

5306
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
I love gambling

5307
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
It's a bad problem I have

5308
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
Anyhow, let's move on to

5309
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
a couple more news stories for you guys

5310
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
and then the Skype line

5311
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
as well as the results of tonight's list list

5312
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
So let's do a couple more stories for you guys

5313
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Loki

5314
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
You may remember a couple weeks back

5315
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
we talked a little bit about people

5316
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,000
that had games on

5317
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
the Indie Games Store

5318
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
on the Xbox Marketplace

5319
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:46,000
were complaining that they just weren't getting enough exposure

5320
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:50,000
and that the sales weren't very well

5321
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
even for some of the top games on that service

5322
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
Well, one of those companies

5323
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Z-Boy Games

5324
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
they, of course, released

5325
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death 7

5326
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:04,000
They now have put their games on Steam

5327
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:08,000
and they're very pleased on how things are going

5328
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
In fact, they're saying that

5329
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
Z-Boy Games

5330
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
has already made more revenue

5331
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
in less than a week on Steam

5332
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
than we have in over a year and a half

5333
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
on Xbox Indie Games

5334
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
That sucks

5335
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
Well, it sucks for the Indie Games

5336
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
but good for them that they're making money

5337
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:30,000
Basically saying that they

5338
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
decided, you know

5339
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
because of this

5340
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
that they're definitely looking at

5341
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
launching more games on to Steam

5342
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:42,000
versus, you know, the Xbox Indie Games service

5343
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
And of course, you may remember

5344
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
they also took donation support

5345
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
That's a pretty big slap in the face

5346
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
to Xbox Live Indie Games

5347
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
and I think a pretty obvious showing

5348
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
of how Steam's doing it right and Xbox

5349
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
isn't doing it right when it comes to the Indie Games

5350
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
but to be fair, there is a little bit of apples and oranges

5351
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
going on here because

5352
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
Steam, that really was

5353
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
their only new release that week

5354
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
whereas with Xbox Live, you still have all the

5355
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
arcade games and all that stuff that they do have to promote

5356
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
But, I'm not going to say I totally disagree

5357
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
I think they should start featuring

5358
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
some Indie Games in the main banner

5359
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
once in a great while, especially these big ones

5360
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
that do very well

5361
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
If they would take the Indie Games

5362
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
and say, have a certain release day

5363
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
for those, and maybe

5364
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
a little bit more quality control with the stuff that's released

5365
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,000
You know, because I know with

5366
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,000
WiiWare and stuff, you have blog sites

5367
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
and everything that lists

5368
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,000
And actually Kotaku's been pretty good about

5369
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:40,000
they don't know

5370
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
I don't know if they do all the Indie Games

5371
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,000
that are released that week

5372
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
or if it's just the ones that

5373
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
they're playing or the ones

5374
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,000
that they think are kind of cool

5375
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:52,000
They'll do a thread every

5376
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
week or so, pointing those out

5377
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,000
and how much you can get them for

5378
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,000
and the links to download them and that kind of stuff

5379
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
I think that they should have something like that

5380
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
where the Playstation Network comes out and says

5381
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
Hey, here's what's releasing on our service

5382
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
and not necessarily promoting them

5383
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
but it's at least mentioning them

5384
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
so people are aware of them

5385
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
and granted, there's a lot of crap on there too

5386
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
but

5387
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
it's just, you know, there's something wrong

5388
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
obviously, if they're making

5389
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
more money on Steam

5390
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
than they are in the Indie Games service

5391
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
in less than a week

5392
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:28,000
I mean, why would you waste your time on Indie Games

5393
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
if you can just

5394
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
put your game on Steam

5395
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
and make that money in a week?

5396
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,000
Yeah, that's kind of scary

5397
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
but then again, if all

5398
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
I mean, Xbox Live gets a lot

5399
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
of Indie Games and these were obviously

5400
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
two of the quality ones

5401
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
If everything that went out on Xbox Live

5402
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
went up on Steam, they wouldn't all sell as well

5403
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
That's the difference

5404
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000
Well, yes, they wouldn't all sell as well

5405
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
but the ones that people are actually putting effort into

5406
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
and are considered hits on

5407
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:58,000
the Indie Games service

5408
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
aren't making that much money anyways

5409
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
I guess that's true enough

5410
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
Alright, let's go to

5411
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
a story here about Akira Yamaoka

5412
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
working with Suda51

5413
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
He's, what they say, tag teaming

5414
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
with Suda51 on the game development

5415
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
This is during an interview on the

5416
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
8-4 play podcast

5417
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
Yamaoka talked a little more about what his

5418
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
role is, besides just the chief

5419
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,000
sound officer

5420
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
Quote, at Grasshopper I'm creating sound

5421
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
but not only sound, I'm the leader of the

5422
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,000
development team, so I'm tag teaming with

5423
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
Suda51, and I'm actually involved

5424
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
with game creation as well as sound

5425
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
He said that there are a few titles they're going

5426
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
to announce soon, so stay tuned

5427
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
There you go

5428
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
By the way, I guess in this podcast

5429
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
he also talked about how he almost quit

5430
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
Konami after his first week

5431
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Be interesting to see

5432
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
Alright

5433
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
I'm all for more Akira Yamaoka

5434
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
games

5435
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
I'm glad he didn't leave the industry altogether

5436
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
that he's still making games

5437
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000
Silent Hill just isn't the same without him

5438
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000
Uh, yeah

5439
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Yeah

5440
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
Yeah

5441
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangetownstory.com

5442
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
There is a little bit of a buffer, so they're still on the last story

5443
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
So let's just pop says, Steam Valve would probably

5444
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
say no to 90% of the shit that

5445
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,000
Xbox Live Indie games have in their store

5446
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
Good, I think that they should

5447
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
But who, see, who is it to determine quality?

5448
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
Because I would say there's some shit

5449
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
on Steam too

5450
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
But one thing I do like about Steam

5451
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
is that they provide quick links

5452
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
to find reviews and so forth

5453
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
And Metacritic, love it or hate it, their score

5454
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
is right there

5455
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
I think they only show it if it's above a certain score

5456
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,000
though, because it's not there for every game

5457
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
But kind of interesting nonetheless

5458
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line

5459
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000
at 1877 Game OLR

5460
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

5461
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
The Skype line is open now for your calls

5462
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
If you want to give us a call

5463
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
We're going to try to keep the calls probably a little brief tonight

5464
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
It's extraordinarily long tonight

5465
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
We're already at a three hour show

5466
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
and we haven't even gotten into calls yet

5467
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
So we're going to take those calls

5468
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
Again, that's 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype

5469
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
is OrangeLoungeRadio

5470
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
Let's see if Loki has any last minute stories

5471
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
Not much

5472
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
They had a

5473
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
Tekken Bowl, I guess, was released this week

5474
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
for free on iOS

5475
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
Which is kind of lame

5476
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
Is that like bowling with Tekken characters?

5477
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
Yes it is!

5478
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
Oh, right, right, right

5479
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
And actually, you're right, because they're going to be

5480
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
featuring that as well in the

5481
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
I guess, Tekken Tag HD

5482
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:28,000
or whatever that they're doing

5483
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
But yeah, you can download it for free

5484
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
Getting it

5485
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
Alright, our phone's ringing

5486
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
so let's go to it

5487
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
Hi, you're on the phone, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

5488
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
Hey, it's the one and only Rama

5489
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Of course, what's up Rama?

5490
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
A whole lot of stuff

5491
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
Just stuff

5492
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
What kind of stuff?

5493
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
Love you too, Rob

5494
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
Love you too

5495
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
Well, what's up?

5496
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
Well, first off

5497
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
I was stoned off

5498
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
off my tuchus last week

5499
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
That's why I ended up with a Playstation 3

5500
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
That's the first thing

5501
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:08,000
You were stoned and you bought a Playstation 3?

5502
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
I was so stoned off

5503
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
my tuchus that the decision to buy one

5504
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
was a good idea

5505
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
Okay, so you bought a PS3

5506
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
when you were high and you regret it now?

5507
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
Actually, no

5508
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000
It's just an expressive blu-ray player like everybody else

5509
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
says, but you know

5510
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
It has a few good games on it

5511
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
I know

5512
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
LittleBigPlanet, I'm telling you

5513
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
It's probably one of the greatest games of this generation

5514
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
period on either console

5515
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
It's in the queue

5516
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
Alright, fair enough

5517
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
Thank you

5518
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
Now, about this whole

5519
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Capcom debacle

5520
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
I'm probably the only

5521
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
person that actually

5522
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
feels that Capcom was in the right

5523
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
to cancel the game

5524
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
The only fuck-up was how they handled the whole

5525
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,000
PR spin on the whole thing

5526
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
I don't necessarily agree

5527
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
that it was right, because I personally

5528
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
am a fan of Mega Man Legends

5529
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
but I am kind of trying to see it from their point of view

5530
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
and I do understand the business perspective

5531
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
If they don't make money, then it's not worth our time

5532
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,000
But I do agree

5533
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
that their biggest faux pas was how they handled it

5534
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
Yeah

5535
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
But defend yourself

5536
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
a little bit to the fanboys

5537
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
You're not even saying

5538
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
like, you're just flattered saying

5539
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
I agree with Capcom, they should just cancel it

5540
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
Why?

5541
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
In this age of money's getting kind of tight

5542
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
a lot of these companies, as much money as they're making

5543
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000
we don't know how much of that is

5544
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
revenue, profit, this or that

5545
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:36,000
Who knows? If they invest a lot of money

5546
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,000
in making this game

5547
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
doesn't fit the bill

5548
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
then they're out a lot of money

5549
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
These companies really can't afford to do that

5550
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,000
And what I find interesting is that

5551
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:50,000
there's not that many Mega Man Legends fans out there

5552
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
Granted, if you look at the online petition

5553
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
there's so many fans

5554
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
but most of them are just jumping on the bandwagon

5555
03:07:56,000 --> 03:08:00,000
just because they need a common cause to fight over

5556
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
I will admit, I wonder how many of those people would actually

5557
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
buy the game and how many are just wanting to pirate it

5558
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:07,000
Because I had the first Mega Man Legends game

5559
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
I'm not going to say it's crap

5560
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
I thought it was a pretty good game

5561
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
I didn't get the second one

5562
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
because it wasn't

5563
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
it was a good concept

5564
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:20,000
but it just wasn't my cup of tea

5565
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
Right

5566
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,000
I kind of wish I could find the game again

5567
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:26,000
I kind of want to play it

5568
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,000
Is it on Playstation 3 download stuff?

5569
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,000
I don't think it is

5570
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
Anyway

5571
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,000
I'm kind of surprised it wasn't

5572
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:36,000
It might have drummed up more interest for a third one

5573
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:38,000
Yeah, but

5574
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:40,000
that's how it goes

5575
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:42,000
Yep

5576
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:45,000
So what about other stuff going on in Capcom's world

5577
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
like the Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 news

5578
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
How do you feel about that?

5579
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
I'm amused that Phoenix Wright is in the game

5580
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
That is kind of awesome

5581
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
But is it $40 awesome?

5582
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
I tend to think so

5583
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
because I have to agree with what Rob D. said

5584
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
They're rebalancing the characters

5585
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
They're adding new stages

5586
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
and adding more features and functionality to make it worth the $40

5587
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
I mean, they kind of did the same thing

5588
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
when they re-released Super Street Fighter 4

5589
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:12,000
I mean, if they did the whole $59.99 price tag

5590
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:15,000
I sure as hell would wait until it drops to $39

5591
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
That's just me

5592
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
Which is, I think, the price point they're going to try and put it out at

5593
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
Mmhmm

5594
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
Woah

5595
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
Sorry, I dropped my phone

5596
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
That wasn't good

5597
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
I hope you have AppleCare on it

5598
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
No, it's fine. No, and I don't have AppleCare either

5599
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
It's just outside a year or two

5600
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
So, no, it's fine. I'm good, we're good

5601
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
Alright, anyhow

5602
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
Well, on that note, anything else on your mind tonight?

5603
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
Last thing, I don't know if you heard

5604
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
but Sears has this massive video game clearance sale

5605
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
at all of their stores

5606
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
Oh, are they just unloading all of the video games altogether?

5607
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:51,000
Yeah, but the thing is

5608
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
your mileage may vary

5609
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
because I've been hitting various stores

5610
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
Like, I do know right now

5611
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
most of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band bundles

5612
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
are $20

5613
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
Nice, Toys R Us did something like that

5614
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,000
a couple weeks ago, and I do kind of want a new Guitar Hero bundle

5615
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:09,000
Yeah, including the big Super bundles

5616
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
I went to one Sears

5617
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:13,000
I picked up Guitar Hero Metallica

5618
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
for 96 cents, so I bought the last three

5619
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
Holy shit

5620
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:19,000
For the record, by the way

5621
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,000
I don't know if you've got Big Lots

5622
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:23,000
I think they opened one up

5623
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,000
by me somewhere

5624
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
We mostly have amazing savings

5625
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
Dan picked up DJ Hero for me the bundle for $20

5626
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:31,000
It was a couple months ago

5627
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
but they get them in

5628
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,000
and we found like a DDR there

5629
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:37,000
for $20 with the pad and everything

5630
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:39,000
Nice

5631
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,000
I was thinking about picking up the DJ Hero 2 bundle

5632
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
and sell the turntable

5633
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:45,000
and find somebody that wanted a turntable

5634
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:47,000
because I already have two

5635
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,000
but nobody I know wants it

5636
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
so I was like, there's no point in me buying it

5637
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,000
because I refuse to sell to

5638
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
the evil people, you know?

5639
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
Right, right

5640
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,000
I used to put it on Craigslist

5641
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
It would be kinda hard too if you don't have the game, you know what I mean?

5642
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:03,000
But you know how that rolls

5643
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,000
Alright, well we're gonna let you go

5644
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
so we can get some more calls

5645
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,000
but thanks for calling, have a good one

5646
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:11,000
Alright, bye-bye

5647
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:13,000
Let's go to the phones

5648
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,000
We got other calls coming in

5649
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
Pick up the phone again

5650
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:19,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

5651
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:21,000
Hey, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto

5652
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:23,000
Hey Kaijuto, what's on your mind, buddy?

5653
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
Not much, I'm gonna make it quick

5654
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
So, what is it, Marvel 3 now?

5655
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:29,000
Marvel vs Capcom 3 Ultimate, yes

5656
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:31,000
Yeah, my thing is

5657
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:33,000
Okay, so this new game

5658
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
is supposed to have more content

5659
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,000
than the original, right?

5660
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,000
And the original is $60, right?

5661
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:41,000
Right

5662
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:43,000
And this new version is gonna be $40, right?

5663
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
Yes

5664
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,000
Why not make all of those fucking fighting games $40?

5665
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
That's a great question

5666
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,000
Why not make all the fucking fighting games $40?

5667
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:53,000
I will say this though, when I was at the

5668
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
place that I will not talk about anymore

5669
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
I did see that they had dropped

5670
03:11:57,000 --> 03:11:59,000
the price of Marvel vs Capcom 3 to $40

5671
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
But that certainly wasn't

5672
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
its price new, originally

5673
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
Yeah, I think

5674
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
To me, when I think fighting game

5675
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,000
I always think retro

5676
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
So I always think that those games should be

5677
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,000
low price, I never understood

5678
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:15,000
the $60 for Street Fighter

5679
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:17,000
I waited for

5680
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:19,000
the second version of Street Fighter

5681
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,000
It's dropped down to $30

5682
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:23,000
Oh, then the place that shouldn't be named

5683
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:25,000
is just overcharging now, what a surprise

5684
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:27,000
I was recent, it was

5685
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:29,000
Thursday, Friday

5686
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:31,000
Okay, well I was there Saturday and they suck

5687
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:33,000
But I want to say

5688
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:35,000
this quickly though, since you brought up retro

5689
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:37,000
I will bring up this

5690
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:39,000
In 95, I think it was

5691
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:41,000
when Street Fighter 2 came out for the

5692
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
Super Nintendo, I remember dropping $70

5693
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:45,000
on that game

5694
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:47,000
I spent $65 on Killer Instinct

5695
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:49,000
I mean, Super Nintendo games were expensive

5696
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,000
a few years ago, which

5697
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:53,000
inflation and all that means

5698
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:55,000
it was probably more like $100 paid for that game

5699
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,000
So, you can't

5700
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:59,000
always say that fighting games have always been cheap

5701
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:01,000
Yeah, that's for sure

5702
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:03,000
But I mean, now I think they're kinda

5703
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:05,000
You know, like I said

5704
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:07,000
Whenever I think Street Fighter

5705
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:09,000
or any of the other games, I'm always thinking

5706
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:11,000
early 90s, I never think

5707
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:13,000
oh, this is a new game, I always feel like it's a

5708
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:15,000
rehash of something that I played

5709
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:17,000
long ago, you know? I have no problem

5710
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
with them, but I just think they were

5711
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:21,000
But seriously, when Street Fighter 2 came out

5712
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:23,000
it was the goddamn arcade

5713
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:25,000
at home. I mean, that translation was

5714
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:27,000
so fucking good of Street Fighter 2

5715
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:29,000
Like, it was just, oh my god

5716
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:31,000
It just blew our minds

5717
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:33,000
Oh, yeah, I remember that

5718
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:35,000
I remember the first time I ever played it on the Super Nintendo

5719
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
I was like, oh shit, I got the

5720
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:39,000
arcade machine in my house

5721
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:41,000
I was like, freaking out

5722
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:43,000
Anyhow, sorry

5723
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:45,000
No problem

5724
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
Yeah, you guys need to get on Minecraft

5725
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:49,000
The pay version, try it

5726
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:51,000
I really do not like Minecraft

5727
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:53,000
I know, I tried, I tried

5728
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
Well, at least it was the free version

5729
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,000
But even Terraria

5730
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:59,000
I didn't mean to cut you off, but the free version

5731
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:01,000
is totally different from the pay version

5732
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:03,000
Trust me, the pay version

5733
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,000
We'll see, if I run out of the other games

5734
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,000
that I have, maybe I'll check it out

5735
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
But I tried playing Terraria

5736
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
this week, it was okay

5737
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
But I was like, oh wow, this really is

5738
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000
just Minecraft

5739
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
Yeah, I kind of hit that too

5740
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:19,000
I did play some in Minecraft

5741
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:21,000
Oh well

5742
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:23,000
Although Dan just showed me something interesting today

5743
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:25,000
Someone created the whole middle earth

5744
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:27,000
pretty much, in Minecraft

5745
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:29,000
Including underground places

5746
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
and the whole dwarven areas and whatnot

5747
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
Yeah, when people take the time to do

5748
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:35,000
that stuff, it actually comes out really interesting

5749
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:37,000
So, that's pretty cool

5750
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:39,000
Anyway, we lost Kaijuto

5751
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:41,000
We did not hang up on him

5752
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:43,000
The Skype connection crapped out

5753
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:45,000
Does that mean, let me just check on the status

5754
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:47,000
of the show, no, we're still streaming, so we're still up and running

5755
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:49,000
So unfortunately, the Kaijuto

5756
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:51,000
thing cut out, but

5757
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
I hope you had a good night, and so on

5758
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:57,000
I'm gonna go ahead and close up Skype, I think, tonight

5759
03:14:57,000 --> 03:14:59,000
So sorry to those of you that didn't get through, sorry it was a shorter

5760
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:01,000
segment than usual, but we're running really long tonight

5761
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:03,000
So, sorry about that

5762
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:05,000
So we're gonna go ahead and wrap up the last minute story

5763
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,000
so we can wrap up the show, so, Loki?

5764
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:09,000
I got nothing

5765
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:11,000
Well, alright then, Dark Soccer, anything?

5766
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:13,000
Well, Salacious Pop brought up

5767
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:15,000
that Capcom published Street Fighter Alpha 2

5768
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
for the SNES

5769
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,000
It was really sucky, and it had loading time

5770
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:21,000
Oh yeah, it was like a Super Nintendo cartridge

5771
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,000
with loading time I own it

5772
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,000
I own it Yeah? Yeah

5773
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,000
And no, I'm not gonna pay for Minecraft

5774
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:31,000
I don't know, I might, when I run out of

5775
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:33,000
other games to play, I'll kinda get to that

5776
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:35,000
but, I still have so many games

5777
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:37,000
I gotta beat, and then Minecraft seems like one of those

5778
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:39,000
time sinks, you spend a lot of time, but I gotta admit

5779
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,000
I would like to explore

5780
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,000
I like exploring worlds, especially

5781
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:45,000
recreations of stuff, so

5782
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,000
like, if there's ways to go in

5783
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:49,000
and explore that middle-earth stuff, that might be kinda fun

5784
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,000
actually, that'd be kinda cool

5785
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,000
Alright, well let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts

5786
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:55,000
so we can close up shop for tonight, so

5787
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:57,000
Loki, what's your

5788
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
final thought tonight?

5789
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
My final thought is

5790
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:03,000
I can't wait till

5791
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:05,000
Tuesday

5792
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:07,000
I'm gonna go be brought

5793
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:09,000
I better fucking bring Saints for the third

5794
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:11,000
I'm gonna be very disappointed otherwise

5795
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:13,000
cause we got like a bunch of people coming in

5796
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:15,000
I know that we're, Ubisoft will probably

5797
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,000
bring Just Dance 3 cause they brought

5798
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:19,000
Just Dance 2 last year

5799
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:21,000
THQ last year brought Smackdown vs.

5800
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:23,000
Raw 11

5801
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:25,000
but I think

5802
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:27,000
you know, if they're bringing the biggest game

5803
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:29,000
it's gonna be Saints for the third

5804
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:31,000
and then of course, Microsoft will be there this year

5805
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:33,000
which is kinda cool, and I know LucasArts

5806
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:35,000
and the

5807
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:37,000
Star Wars Connect game

5808
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:39,000
so, lots of stuff to play

5809
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:41,000
Well then good, I wanna hear your rundowns on it next week

5810
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
so, my final thought is

5811
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,000
this show ran long

5812
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
and it's getting late

5813
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:49,000
I'm getting hungry, so, it's time to go

5814
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:51,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

5815
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:53,000
I just texted Dan that I have hungers

5816
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:55,000
and he needs to bring me my burger

5817
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,000
You want a taco? Oh no, you want a burger

5818
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:59,000
Well, Dan's bringing me a burger

5819
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:01,000
I don't have to pay for a burger

5820
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:03,000
I want a taco

5821
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:05,000
Actually, I want a fish taco

5822
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,000
Maybe tomorrow

5823
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:09,000
Alright, well that's gonna do it for another week here at Orange Lawns Radio

5839
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:11,000
You know, and just a note to myself

5840
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:13,000
When I'm scripting next week's show

5841
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:15,000
If I'm gonna put a list list on, I should also put

5842
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:17,000
at the end, list list results

5843
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:19,000
and then that way I won't forget it

5844
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,000

5846
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:25,000

03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:27,000
