00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:22,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, July 24th, 2011, games appear to be incoming to Google+, Sony experiments with virtual reality, and you know we've got to talk about Capcom.

2
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:38,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:47,461
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about video games and gaming culture and all of that with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

4
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:48,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooga.

5
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:48,882
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

6
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:49,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Booga.

7
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:52,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura, you've been very, very naughty.

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, sir.

9
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:53,662
[SPEAKER_02]: May I have another?

10
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:16,541
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

11
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:19,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster, Loki.

12
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:21,345
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Loki?

13
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:22,807
[SPEAKER_02]: You're actually muted.

14
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:23,187
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

15
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:24,188
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing now, Loki?

16
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:24,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing better.

17
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:27,030
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having mic fail tonight in studio.

18
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:30,113
[SPEAKER_02]: If I sound different, by the way, don't adjust your speakers.

19
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:31,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on our end.

20
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:32,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on backup mic tonight.

21
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:33,376
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on helium.

22
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:35,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, maybe a little bit.

23
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:41,803
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think I'm just on the overly sensitive mic, which for my voice is really not good, but that's all we got tonight.

24
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:42,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob's high on life.

25
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's switch mics.

26
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:50,531
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because I know you're going to have a rant or two in you tonight, and I'm not letting you do that on this mic.

27
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:53,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You will blow up speakers across America and beyond.

28
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:56,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's new in your world, Loki?

29
00:01:58,558 --> 00:01:58,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

30
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:01,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So Josh is turning one very soon, right?

31
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a week from Monday.

32
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Your baby is turning one.

33
00:02:04,062 --> 00:02:08,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other week you were talking about your possible party plans you were doing.

34
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:12,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was talking to the wife today, and it sounds like you guys have settled on a theme, correct?

35
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:13,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.

36
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always going to be like the pork party.

37
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:19,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought at one point you were talking about the pedo bear party.

38
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:22,596
[SPEAKER_04]: No, those were just funny ideas we were throwing around.

39
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:23,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, I see.

40
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:25,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are going to do the pork party.

41
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

42
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:28,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Teach the child at a young age about the wonders of bacon, right?

43
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

44
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,179
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

45
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:31,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, have fun with that.

46
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,720
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be a lot of fun.

47
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,380
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:44,043
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have fun with you guys here live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, as we do every week, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

49
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:52,746
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to join us in chat, we are ready to go in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and we do read comments from chat throughout the show.

50
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:57,667
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, some folks commenting on Bunga Bunga, the game we were talking about a minute ago.

51
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says that game didn't make it outside of Japan.

52
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder why, y'all.

53
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:05,349
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, seriously, like Google it.

54
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a real game, so it's something else.

55
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,291
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had the money and it was cheap enough, I'd... You would import it?

56
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:11,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd import it.

57
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:13,652
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really expensive to import.

58
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:15,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Give that to Josh for his birthday?

59
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,773
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd just be fun to have.

60
00:03:16,873 --> 00:03:18,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put it in my garage.

61
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:20,014
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is that?

62
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, want to come over?

63
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,761
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what you been doing?

64
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:45,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I played WoW.

65
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally hit my next item level.

66
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Congrats.

67
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:48,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Addict.

68
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:49,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Dealer.

69
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:53,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played some other games.

70
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Kid Dracula again because I love that game.

71
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back, kicking it Game Boy.

72
00:03:59,283 --> 00:04:01,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Kid Dracula is an old ass game.

73
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:08,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and we actually watched a playthrough of the NES version, so I was playing the Game Boy version.

74
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:14,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have been fighting and fighting with Planet Harriers to get it to work on MAME to no avail.

75
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:16,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not done yet.

76
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:21,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but there's a Hikaru BIOS and all this other stuff I was playing with and it's not working.

77
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:24,923
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well...

78
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Classic Gaming in Your Week Classic Gaming in Your Week

79
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,841
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

80
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've been all about the homebrew.

81
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:23,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw an interesting little cabinet the other day.

82
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:27,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at this pizza joint in town that had... It wasn't an Altercade.

83
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that right off the bat.

84
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:28,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't an Altercade.

85
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:32,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some other type of machine that had a lot of classic games in it.

86
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:37,172
[SPEAKER_02]: But the interesting thing about it is it was Pac-Man and Donkey Kong and Galaga.

87
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:45,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was kind of like... You don't usually see Nintendo games participating in the collections because Nintendo keeps that stuff to Nintendo.

88
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:46,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of weird.

89
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:47,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, where did this...

90
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:48,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the PlayChoice?

91
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, where did... No, it wasn't PlayChoice, though.

92
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:55,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like actual arcade Pac-Man and Galaga and stuff, so... And that was talking about the Nintendo ones.

93
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:56,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I remember those.

94
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:58,007
[SPEAKER_07]: The Nintendo's were the PlayChoice games.

95
00:05:58,027 --> 00:05:59,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or like the Wii and stuff now.

96
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:03,732
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't see a lot of like the retro... It had to have been a homebrew type of self-made thing.

97
00:06:03,752 --> 00:06:04,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

98
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:11,198
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting, though, because, you know, I remember Salacious Pop commenting on it like, those are games you wouldn't usually see together in a collection.

99
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I don't think it's a homebrew thing.

100
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,000
[SPEAKER_04]: They have...

101
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:22,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Other machines, they're very similar to the multi-game machines.

102
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:24,488
[SPEAKER_04]: They have packs that you can buy.

103
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:30,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, okay, here's Atari games, here's Nintendo, here's Capcom or whatever.

104
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've got those out there.

105
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:37,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just I didn't know Nintendo to usually participate in those.

106
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:41,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it's kind of like they keep it for their own systems and so forth.

107
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:46,892
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever's alright well let's move on Loki how was your gaming week?

108
00:06:48,553 --> 00:07:02,858
[SPEAKER_04]: same old stuff didn't really play a whole ton of stuff other than basically Grand Theft Auto and I think I did play a little bit of Earth Defense Force in there this week mainly Grand Theft Auto just you know

109
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:05,956
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

110
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:26,730
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

111
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:39,664
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

112
00:07:57,061 --> 00:08:23,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no, it was funny, we, uh, we have these nice Sony headsets, like, headphones, I should say, not headsets, um, headphones that we use for the gameplay, we have it hooked up through the stereo connectors on all the VGA cables, but, you know, as you know, you can't really talk over a headset because the headset goes on your head, and it's usually meant for people to have TV's,

113
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:23,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

114
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:43,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what I did.

115
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:45,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I snapped the headpiece off.

116
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:48,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I broke the thing apart.

117
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:51,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I took out the actual speaker from the headphone.

118
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:57,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, the only way I could attach it to it is with plain old tape.

119
00:08:58,489 --> 00:08:59,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Just scotch tape.

120
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even duct tape.

121
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even duct tape.

122
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:03,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Just scotch tape.

123
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:06,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the reason why I did scotch tape, because these are nice headphones.

124
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:08,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to ruin them.

125
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want it to stay.

126
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:14,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And it works great, because now we have the nice headphones, and we can talk.

127
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:22,878
[SPEAKER_04]: for the occasional person that's from Mexico or... Usually it's the UK.

128
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:34,605
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got people that complain in the UK and every now and then it's like, gee, I really wish I had a headset so I could tell them to shut the hell up because they'll be like, oh, you have to use the stickies to kill me.

129
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:35,005
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

130
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:35,906
[SPEAKER_04]: You suck?

131
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:37,947
[SPEAKER_04]: You just can't kill me with anything else?

132
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:41,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I proceed to kill them with every weapon in the game and they still complain.

133
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:41,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

134
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,511
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've gotten in lately.

135
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:49,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Long story short, you fixed headphones so that you could smack talk people on Xbox Live this week.

136
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:51,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And what types of things do you tell them off with?

137
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:54,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want some tea and crumpets with your wine?

138
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:56,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really been using it to talk.

139
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:58,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I originally gave it to my co-worker, Jason.

140
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:05,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, we had to take it away from him because all he kept doing throughout the first game is going, Hello?

141
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

142
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, listen, okay?

143
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:12,330
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to talk like a rapist over the goddamn...

144
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,971
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, headset.

145
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:15,712
[SPEAKER_04]: We're taking that damn thing away from you.

146
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:24,078
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I gave it to my other coworker, Rob, now, and he'll usually do a Julia Child impersonation on there, which is pretty fun.

147
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:26,540
[SPEAKER_07]: First, we're going to get the cake and kill you with it.

148
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,141
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all, hello, boobies!

149
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:31,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, that sounds like Dame Edna, actually.

150
00:10:31,783 --> 00:10:33,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, my puppets!

151
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:36,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to your death!

152
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:46,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say that his impersonations were good, but he'll do the French knight from... Shall I kill you with my sticky whip?

153
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:48,910
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some pretty funny ones.

154
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I love playing with the people in the UK because I love their accent.

155
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:58,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And the kids that we play with on there, I'm going to get the orange, fella.

156
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:02,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Really proper English is hilarious to me.

157
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:09,405
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I didn't think any British impersonation could be worse than mine, but yours is really bad.

158
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:11,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was doing an impersonation of what he does.

159
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:15,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't vouch for his impersonation of anything.

160
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,229
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just fun.

161
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, this is just a temporary thing until I get my Saints Row headset.

162
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:28,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we do know that the Saints Row Collector's Edition headset is not compatible through Live.

163
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:32,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Without some adapters that I can easily find.

164
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:35,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will have my auto-tuned voice.

165
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,103
[SPEAKER_02]: They're selling headsets for Saints Row that you can't use for live?

166
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:39,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and it comes with a collector's edition.

167
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:43,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only meant for PCs and phones.

168
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:44,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

169
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:49,034
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because it's got a 3.5mm connection, whereas most of those things are 2.5mm.

170
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:50,736
[SPEAKER_02]: They were too cheap to make a deal with Microsoft.

171
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:52,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they were too cheap.

172
00:11:52,517 --> 00:12:06,567
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically there's a thing that you can get that splits a headset into both the speaker and the microphone port and then there's something in the reverse that goes to 2.5mm.

173
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:11,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can get that stuff and I can make it work.

174
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:12,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already figured it out.

175
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:14,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already bookmarked the stuff on Amazon.

176
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,255
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all a matter of waiting now.

177
00:12:17,635 --> 00:12:18,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I've... I've thought of...

178
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to do one better on that.

179
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:41,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do this once I get that actual device to connect my autotune headset.

180
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:50,076
[SPEAKER_04]: You hook up a splitter to it and then you hook it up to your iPod or iPhone or whatever and just pull up a soundboard and tap away.

181
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:50,636
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

182
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:51,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

183
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:53,997
[SPEAKER_04]: The Trash Talk is pretty awesome, but it's only four.

184
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:59,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you want Duke Nukem to say a few other things other than the four preset stuff.

185
00:12:59,238 --> 00:12:59,618
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

186
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:02,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Four insults is very limiting.

187
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:02,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

188
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:03,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Repeat yourself a little much.

189
00:13:04,053 --> 00:13:04,313
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

190
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:09,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And pushing buttons on the headset and stuff to make Duke Nukem say things.

191
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:15,456
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny, but see, the problem is because I cut the speaker off, so I can't hear what it's actually saying.

192
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't hear myself talk over everything.

193
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:23,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only hear my coworkers saying, oh, yeah, I heard you.

194
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:25,198
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way.

195
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:40,059
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever works good luck in your trash talking with the Brits adventure whatever comes of that let's see my gaming week actually not a whole lot of new stuff I had a very Jamie week all I really played was wow this week

196
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play a few other things, though.

197
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:44,862
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a few other things I played.

198
00:13:45,662 --> 00:13:47,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I went back to the fitness game, and I gave that another go.

199
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:53,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember I razzed that game on the show last week, the Yourself Fitness, because it didn't have me stretched beforehand?

200
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:55,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this time I stretched, and what do you know?

201
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it a lot further in the opening act.

202
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:04,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually made it through the entire calibration this time and didn't feel like dying the next day.

203
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:08,574
[SPEAKER_02]: My legs were a little sore that night, but it wasn't nearly the pain and suffering I went through the week before.

204
00:14:08,954 --> 00:14:10,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm actually walking today.

205
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think you can bring it over?

206
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:12,397
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to see it.

207
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you come over to my place?

208
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:14,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I always have to come over here?

209
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:17,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You should come pet the kitties.

210
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to go to your place, but you've never given me your address, silly Rob.

211
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my address is... Something.

212
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:23,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.

213
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:24,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say it here.

214
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:26,407
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

215
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:29,551
[SPEAKER_04]: 1, 2, 3, any street, Anytown, USA

216
00:14:50,066 --> 00:15:02,016
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a place where they take kids in elementary school, and it's one of those tiny towns where all the buildings are built at a kid's height or whatever, so that when they're walking through the town, they're little Godzillas in the town.

217
00:15:02,056 --> 00:15:08,702
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's where they learn about safety and look both ways before you cross the street, or the little plastic cars will get you, things like that.

218
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:12,705
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's adorable to drive by and look at because all these tiny, chibi little buildings.

219
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:17,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know why, but Loki talking about any town in the USA, maybe think of Safetyville, USA.

220
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:19,289
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like that town in Hot Fuzz.

221
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

222
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen Hot Fuzz, so I guess.

223
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,891
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like a miniature of the main village.

224
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:25,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there?

225
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:25,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

226
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:27,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see like any movies.

227
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:29,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just talking about this the other day.

228
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:31,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see Captain America.

229
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:33,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see Green Lantern.

230
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:34,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see Green Hornet.

231
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:36,053
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because Green Lantern was shit anyway.

232
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:39,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but you are clearly a Marvel fan girl.

233
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:43,215
[SPEAKER_07]: DC fans have said that Green Lantern was shit.

234
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:44,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it was terrible.

235
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:44,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

236
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:46,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, look.

237
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:52,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of y'all don't want to hear it, but I would gladly pay money to look at Ryan Reynolds for two hours, okay?

238
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:53,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's actually not him.

239
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:54,898
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a CG fake body.

240
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:57,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when Deadpool comes out... Imagination's all the same.

241
00:15:58,138 --> 00:15:59,179
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, look.

242
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,939
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what we're here to talk about.

243
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Other games I played this week.

244
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I did check out the demo for one new title.

245
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:14,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like doing game reviews based on a demo, but I will say it was a great demo, and it did kind of sell me on the game, and that was Bastion on Xbox Live, which is a new game that's...

246
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:17,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer of Arcade Solstice and Equinox

247
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:37,162
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

248
00:16:55,451 --> 00:17:14,547
[SPEAKER_02]: and I used to love those games and so when I played Bastion it kind of was that same thing I was like oh this is kind of cool but it's the art style is very different the art style reminds me a little more something like I don't know Braid or something but what I thought was really neat about it is that the levels kind of appear as you're walking very interesting and then of course most of all the way the story is told is that

249
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:16,368
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

250
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,628
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

251
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:11,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do have to kind of make some decisions.

252
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, I don't know, I thought that was kind of neat.

253
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the whole way it was designed.

254
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:17,992
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely think I will pick up the full version of that.

255
00:18:18,393 --> 00:18:23,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It does seem to be like there's, like I noticed right when I got to the end of the demo in the main world.

256
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:32,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not the main world, but like, I guess the Bastion Square or whatever the central square is that's supposed to be like the hub that I guess the rest of the game takes place through.

257
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:38,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that there was a place where I could put a shop of one of two types.

258
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I could pick one or the other.

259
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:44,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like the choice on what you put there will affect your game a little later.

260
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:51,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the demo doesn't let you kind of fully realize that out, but I'll have to tell you more about that when I pick up the full game.

261
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:52,034
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

262
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:55,015
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya is asking, can you do the rest of the show like that?

263
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:55,655
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can't.

264
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:17,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll read an email tonight in that voice.

265
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:18,878
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura can pick an email and I'll do it.

266
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:19,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

267
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:20,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

268
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:21,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

269
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:21,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to do it.

270
00:19:23,381 --> 00:19:23,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

271
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop trying to get out of reading emails.

272
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:28,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really it.

273
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:31,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I've just been playing a lot of the other same stuff I've been playing.

274
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:32,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Beat Hazard.

275
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:35,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to play Survival Mode one night.

276
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:35,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get very far.

277
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I got through like a song and a half.

278
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, you know, playing some other stuff on Steam.

279
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Bit.Trip and some of the other games I've talked about in previous weeks.

280
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:57,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Bastion is probably the only new thing I've played I have two games at home sitting for my game rental service waiting to play and I just haven't gotten around to playing them and that's Test Drive 2 and one of the Need for Speed games I don't even remember which one

281
00:19:58,686 --> 00:19:59,507
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

282
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:37,183
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know I'm not going to tell anybody else what to do and I realize that there are people that might be employees of GameStop and so forth that listen to this show and I want you to know the boycott does not have to do with any type of like store employee

283
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:57,023
[SPEAKER_02]: but the management of GameStop is like doing things to a friend of mine right now that I really don't agree with and we're talking like things of a legal nature that just like disgust me like the way this person who worked for this company with so much loyalty for so many years really I think demonstrated and somebody who I think

284
00:20:58,104 --> 00:20:59,065
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

285
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,965
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to do that to people.

286
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:31,409
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gross.

287
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,873
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's... I don't know.

288
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:34,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to support it.

289
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:38,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to support this company...

290
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how far I want to go with this.

291
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to be careful what I say.

292
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:45,623
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just saying, I'm boycotting GameStop.

293
00:21:46,644 --> 00:21:50,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I would encourage you, but I'm not going to tell you what to do.

294
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:53,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize we may have employees that listen to the show.

295
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is no fault of a store employee or anything like that.

296
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:01,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize people have to do what they have to do, especially in this economy, to make a living.

297
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:02,737
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just going to say...

298
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:09,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope... Sometimes I really hope these rumors are true that digital distribution may kill GameStop.

299
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, again, no offense to those of you that work in the retail front.

300
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you all find other jobs somewhere else very soon.

301
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:18,761
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't because they bought a digital distribution company.

302
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:20,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that will hopefully fail miserably.

303
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:21,742
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I hope.

304
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:26,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the management and the uppers at GameStop clearly are just...

305
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:26,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Assholes.

306
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:31,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I have freedom of speech, freedom of press granted to me in the US Constitution.

307
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:35,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say, in my humble opinion, GameStop management is assholes.

308
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:38,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am not going to support a company run by assholes.

309
00:22:40,197 --> 00:22:40,918
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as simple as that.

310
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:43,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I will now step off my soapbox.

311
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:45,815
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was something that came to mind this week.

312
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:52,199
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually something that I wanted to address like two weeks ago, but I think it was the same week as our ninth anniversary show, so I kind of never got into it.

313
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm not as ranty pants as I probably would have been that week.

314
00:22:57,964 --> 00:23:02,287
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm feeling like I needed to touch on that at some point.

315
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:04,928
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't ever hear me talk about that store again, now you know why.

316
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's bad news about them.

317
00:23:10,012 --> 00:23:18,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I will continue to do my job of reporting on them in the most impartial way I possibly can here on the show.

318
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:23,500
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whether the news is good or bad, we'll continue to report on it so you guys can talk about it.

319
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,481
[SPEAKER_02]: But just don't expect me to be their cheerleader.

320
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:29,904
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Dan's been like the recipient of like three payouts from class action lawsuits.

321
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:30,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

322
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:31,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

323
00:23:31,585 --> 00:23:31,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

324
00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:33,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I hope...

325
00:23:37,788 --> 00:23:45,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in chat says, was it the planking thing?

326
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:50,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I read about that where the GameStop employees got fired for doing the planking.

327
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:54,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, now I can't believe I'm going to say this after my rant.

328
00:23:54,956 --> 00:23:55,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you heard of this?

329
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:57,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that like that Pilates move?

330
00:23:57,378 --> 00:24:01,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember like in the 50s when people used to sit on flagpoles and that's what was cool?

331
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:11,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's cool now is to put pictures on Twitter of yourself lying dead in the most strange places, like in the middle of traffic or what these GameStop employees did.

332
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:20,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a news.google search on GameStop planking and a guy is lying dead between two GameStop displays, like a plank, like a straight plank.

333
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:22,198
[SPEAKER_04]: He was laying on top of the displays.

334
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:24,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's lying on top of the displays.

335
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:49,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gotta admit, even though I just chewed GameStop out there That was a real dumb thing to do, to be in your GameStop uniform and take a picture like that I mean, actually in that case, I kinda think I know why GameStop hired me I think they're allowed to do that, I gotta say Otherwise, they're assholes It's like the stewardess that put pictures of herself on the airplane, showing some cleavage

336
00:24:49,617 --> 00:24:56,001
[SPEAKER_02]: or the Disney employees at Euro Disney that were all in the costumes and they were doing nasty things backstage.

337
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:58,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put that shit on the internet.

338
00:24:58,983 --> 00:25:02,346
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're gonna do it, keep it on your phone and laugh at a party or something.

339
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:03,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put it on the internet.

340
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:04,327
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the dumb thing they did.

341
00:25:04,347 --> 00:25:07,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, my experience with planking has to do with Pilates.

342
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:09,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here we go.

343
00:25:09,863 --> 00:25:10,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft.

344
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:14,508
[SPEAKER_02]: See, this is why I love having a live chat because chat will actually link us to these things live.

345
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:16,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

346
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to bring this up so you can see the picture here, DarkSakura.

347
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:21,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it up too.

348
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:25,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe... Oh, Spazinator in chat tells me that flagpole sitting was in the 1920s.

349
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:25,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually...

350
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:31,125
[SPEAKER_07]: That was, um... I thought it was the 50s.

351
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:31,545
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

352
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:36,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then Swallowing Goldfish, or... Oh, this is actually kind of cool.

353
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:38,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, you like that?

354
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's ridiculous.

355
00:25:41,131 --> 00:25:44,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, it is ridiculous, but it's kind of neat.

356
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:45,914
[SPEAKER_07]: That's some good abdominal control.

357
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:48,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I've complained about...

358
00:25:48,436 --> 00:25:50,658
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the most unpredictable woman I've ever met.

359
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:50,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

360
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:53,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is saying a lot because most women are unpredictable.

361
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,262
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, this is retarded.

362
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

363
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:57,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid.

364
00:25:57,703 --> 00:26:01,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been told not to say retarded by my wife.

365
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:02,846
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have been retarded people.

366
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:03,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

367
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:06,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you should cut back on that quite frankly, but.

368
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:07,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

369
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:08,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to tell you what you can and can't say.

370
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It is incredibly stupid.

371
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:12,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this, Konin, which is the new thing where you.

372
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:13,694
[SPEAKER_07]: You're offending stupid people.

373
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:18,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you go through the drive-thru, order an ice cream cone, and then you grab the ice cream off the cone.

374
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:19,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

375
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:21,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just think you're stupid.

376
00:26:22,425 --> 00:26:23,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, man!

377
00:26:24,468 --> 00:26:25,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, you're smart.

378
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:25,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, tell me that.

379
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,011
[SPEAKER_02]: What is coning?

380
00:26:28,012 --> 00:26:31,076
[SPEAKER_02]: You get an ice cream cone, and then someone else runs by and takes the ice cream off the cone?

381
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:31,777
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

382
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:33,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

383
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this is what... These are the people that will be voters someday.

384
00:26:58,812 --> 00:27:01,973
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're not already, thank you for ruining the world.

385
00:27:02,373 --> 00:27:04,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was called fire in the hole.

386
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:06,194
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what people did.

387
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:10,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And that actually was not cool because somebody got burned over that whole thing.

388
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:16,558
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fire in the hole is where you go through a drive-thru and you order the combo meal and then you yell fire in the hole and throw the soda.

389
00:27:18,358 --> 00:27:19,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Not through the window.

390
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,381
[SPEAKER_02]: But some asshole did it with coffee and burned some guy.

391
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:24,842
[SPEAKER_02]: That is actually not funny.

392
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:25,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course.

393
00:27:25,842 --> 00:27:28,964
[SPEAKER_04]: It always takes stupider people to ruin everything.

394
00:27:29,184 --> 00:27:31,105
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a new thing called owling.

395
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:34,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I would demonstrate owling, except I don't know if this chair would hold me.

396
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:41,190
[SPEAKER_04]: But owling is basically where you kind of squat down on top of something like you're a stupid owl.

397
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you take a picture of it.

398
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:45,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, planking wasn't dumb enough.

399
00:27:45,472 --> 00:27:46,633
[SPEAKER_04]: So the people have to...

400
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Come up with even dumber things.

401
00:27:49,215 --> 00:27:49,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

402
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:52,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just stupid.

403
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,620
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet makes people stupid.

404
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:57,562
[SPEAKER_02]: We have proof.

405
00:27:59,764 --> 00:28:11,294
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I didn't mean to get... You're not supposed to... After I do a rant like that on GameStop, you're not supposed to give me a news article where I agree with one of their crappy management decisions.

406
00:28:12,495 --> 00:28:14,177
[SPEAKER_02]: They also fired the person that took the picture.

407
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:19,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's justified.

408
00:28:19,346 --> 00:28:23,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it, but you're there to work, not to do fucking planking photos.

409
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:28,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can't make my fellow employee do his job if he wants to go lay down on something.

410
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:34,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking the picture to expedite this whole retarded, stupid thing that he is doing.

411
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:35,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

412
00:28:36,263 --> 00:29:00,396
[SPEAKER_02]: well okay but let me put it this way let me put it this way let's say those employees leave their position at GameStop and go plank somewhere else and GameStop threatens to do things to them because they've done things after the fact that's kind of what's going on in another situation right now and that's why I think it's just just icky so that's all I'm gonna say

413
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:03,532
[SPEAKER_02]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com

414
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:27,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can't wait to see where we're going to start tonight.

415
00:29:28,772 --> 00:29:30,694
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the internet talking about tonight?

416
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:41,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about a wonderful game that was highly anticipated, made by Capcom, long-awaited sequel to Mega Man Legends.

417
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:49,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man Legends 3, this project that they were also kind of getting input from the fans themselves to help them create this game.

418
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:51,811
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, you know what?

419
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:56,233
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're not going to put it up.

420
00:29:56,273 --> 00:30:04,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Originally, they were going to have this prototype version that was going to hit the eShop and you're going to be able to download it.

421
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:09,556
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they started doing this crap like, well, not a lot of people download this game.

422
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:10,476
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to make it.

423
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:16,098
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now they're like, well, there's not enough systems that sold, so we're not going to make it.

424
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:31,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the actual quote, I guess, is, Unfortunately, it was not felt that the Mega Man Legends 3 project met the required criteria to go into full productions, and thus it was pulled.

425
00:30:35,145 --> 00:30:41,648
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently they're saying there's a fan campaign going on now to get people, you know, get them to put this game out.

426
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:43,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a few problems with this.

427
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:48,691
[SPEAKER_02]: One... Not to be rude, but that fan campaign will be about as effective as the mother fan campaign.

428
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:49,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

429
00:30:50,405 --> 00:31:14,223
[SPEAKER_04]: uh number one um who told Capcom to fucking put it on 3ds anyways I mean that's risky you're you're kind of assuming well it's a Nintendo system it's gonna sell incredibly well but what happens if it if it doesn't they're like what do you mean what if it happens if it doesn't it's a Nintendo system it's gonna sell incredibly well I mean that's kind of their logic there and then when it didn't they're like crap um

430
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:19,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why they just don't put it out on their system.

431
00:31:19,507 --> 00:31:30,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, God, it can't be that hard to port a PlayStation 1 looking game onto another system like Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, WiiWare...

432
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:51,171
[SPEAKER_02]: you've always been quite the fan of Mega Man Legends haven't you because I remember earlier episodes of the show and I mean like early in the first few years of the show where you were talking about how much you love those games and you always wish they'd make a third one so now here it is Capcom's gonna make a third one and then oh well you know what and it was one of the reasons I got a 3DS granted not one of the top reasons I got a 3DS

433
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:59,596
[SPEAKER_04]: But at this point, I'll take any reason to justify getting a 3DS because there's not many reasons out there.

434
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:08,121
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's one of those things, it's seriously stupid because this is one of the games, oh yeah, the fans wanted this and we're going to take all this fan support.

435
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they're like, well, we didn't get a lot of support on this.

436
00:32:12,483 --> 00:32:15,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're gonna give... They're gonna abort.

437
00:32:15,085 --> 00:32:18,388
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna have a live abortion of Mega Man and make all their fans watch.

438
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:18,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love it.

439
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:23,952
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't get enough support on the forums for this, you know, voting processing.

440
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:26,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but...

441
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,451
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the fucking game developer.

442
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:32,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you need people to input on the game?

443
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:35,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we didn't get enough input on the game, so we don't know what to do.

444
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:44,179
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you do in the situation where you don't ask the fans what they want, and you just, I don't know, create, develop, if you will, the game?

445
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,942
[SPEAKER_02]: The crowdsourcing was not up to our expectations, so we fired all the employees.

446
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:49,422
[SPEAKER_02]: You.

447
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:50,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It was stupid.

448
00:32:51,223 --> 00:32:54,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just Capcom being Capcom now.

449
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but Capcom's kind of...

450
00:32:56,989 --> 00:32:57,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they're doing.

451
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some people higher up are making really dumb decisions.

452
00:33:12,345 --> 00:33:15,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's awesome.

453
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:17,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's shove it in his face.

454
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:20,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'll show the fans.

455
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:24,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see the point.

456
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:30,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there could be, to play devil's advocate here a little bit, could there be legitimate concern on Capcom's part

457
00:33:30,931 --> 00:33:31,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And so therefore it's not worth...

458
00:33:50,376 --> 00:34:17,991
[SPEAKER_04]: they've done more retarded things like they put out the Mega Man powered up Mega Man game on the PSP and they did the Mega Man I think there was a Mega Man X kind of remake thing on the PSP as well that I mean the PSP it didn't have that many people that bought it and in a game like that especially where it's just a remake of the first Mega Man game not a lot of people really cared about that even though it was kind of cool they had a level editor and stuff like that

459
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:19,292
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

460
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:53,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and 2 and you know there's cameos from the Servbot characters are everywhere like you know and Dead Rising and all that stuff and people love Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and Tatsunoko vs. Capcom I mean they're definitely around there it's just

461
00:34:54,712 --> 00:34:56,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's just kind of stupid.

462
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:59,697
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some games you just put out to make the fans happy.

463
00:34:59,857 --> 00:35:08,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, you're not going to make a lot of money on it, but I'm sorry, but when you're not really marketing this game, you're not really...

464
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:10,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

465
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:40,288
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with porting a game like Mega Man Legends 3 to Xbox Live and PSN versus the 3DS is because Capcom could sell it for $40 on a physical medium versus $15 on a digital-only medium.

466
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:45,191
[SPEAKER_02]: TheRobD in our chatroom says, Reasons why Capcom probably canceled Mega Man Legends 3.

467
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:48,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Not many people liked Mega Man Legends 1 and 2.

468
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:50,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Inafune left.

469
00:35:50,294 --> 00:35:51,334
[SPEAKER_02]: 3DS didn't sell well.

470
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:52,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Lack of fan demand.

471
00:35:52,935 --> 00:35:53,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick any of those reasons.

472
00:35:54,036 --> 00:35:54,817
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them are valid.

473
00:35:55,157 --> 00:35:58,839
[SPEAKER_02]: That said, with the fan support they were asking for, they should have released the game.

474
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:01,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Who said that they couldn't put it on a physical medium?

475
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:05,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they could have easily done that and put it out as a disc sell for 40 bucks.

476
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people would have eaten it up.

477
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:11,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, especially if they'd released it as a budget title, quote unquote, or it was like $29.99.

478
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:13,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have sold like crazy, I think.

479
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:21,241
[SPEAKER_04]: and you could do download content later on because everyone's about download content but Capcom just doesn't get it.

480
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:25,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're going to be talking about some other stuff from Capcom but let's look at what they're doing.

481
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's their good ideas that they have.

482
00:36:29,932 --> 00:36:30,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Death Rising 2 Death Rising 2

483
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:46,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of dumb.

484
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:52,715
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have, you know, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

485
00:36:53,655 --> 00:37:03,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, well, you know, we were going to offer download content for the first game, and we charged a buttload for a couple of them, and then we said, fuck you!

486
00:37:03,984 --> 00:37:05,164
[SPEAKER_04]: You buy a disc now.

487
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:06,185
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

488
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:11,930
[SPEAKER_04]: and then all the stuff that they're doing on the IOS marketplace.

489
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Their crappy DRM.

490
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:16,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's just a lot of really bad decisions.

491
00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:20,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see this similar type of trend with other companies.

492
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Activision, for example.

493
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,921
[SPEAKER_04]: They just kind of have to have a reality check for a little bit.

494
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:33,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and let's not forget to mention Devil May Cry, how they're rebooting that franchise.

495
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:36,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what they're doing to Dante.

496
00:37:36,627 --> 00:37:37,448
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just ridiculous.

497
00:37:37,796 --> 00:37:44,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it maybe be that it's not so much the news that they've cancelled the project, but it was kind of the way they delivered the news?

498
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:51,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, part of me thinks, especially seeing in our chatroom that there are some people that are kind of sympathetic to why Capcom cancelled Mega Man Universe.

499
00:37:52,685 --> 00:37:53,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mega Man Legends 3, actually.

500
00:37:53,946 --> 00:37:55,187
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another comment on Mega Man Universe.

501
00:37:55,847 --> 00:37:57,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget that project was cancelled, too.

502
00:37:57,568 --> 00:37:58,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come back to that in a minute.

503
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:13,785
[SPEAKER_02]: but see that's the point could it be the way they handled it like you know Netflix took a lot of crap a couple weeks ago for the way they handled the news about the price increase to Netflix service could maybe Capcom have handled this a little better well I mean

504
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:16,689
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

505
00:38:39,798 --> 00:38:53,691
[SPEAKER_02]: that that strikes me as odd like that they talked about this whole way you better buy the prototype if you want the game type essentially is what they're saying without saying it and now they've just canned the whole thing they're not even gonna let the prototype come out that strikes me as very like just

506
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,257
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

507
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:27,715
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just, I wasn't that, I mean, I thought it was cool, but I wasn't super psyched.

508
00:39:27,755 --> 00:39:46,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it would have been nice to have a game that I was kind of looking forward to on the 3DS, but I've just kind of come to accept that the stuff on the 3DS, there's just a lot of the stuff I was looking forward to, and trust me, there's been already three games canceled on the 3DS, including Mega Man Legends 3 that I was looking forward to for the 3DS.

509
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:50,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Saints Row on the 3DS, and DJ Hero on the 3DS, all of those have

510
00:39:50,802 --> 00:39:53,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, DJ Hero's not surprising, though, considering what went on over there.

511
00:39:53,724 --> 00:40:02,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that, but these were all games that kind of sold me on a 3DS, other than, you know, Kid Icarus looks pretty awesome.

512
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:08,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Nintendo's going to recover a little bit come Christmas time, though, and I think some of these companies might regret it, you know?

513
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:09,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but we'll see.

514
00:40:10,076 --> 00:40:12,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read some other comments in chat because some of these are really good here.

515
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:14,459
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says,

516
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:53,084
[SPEAKER_02]: well, you can't say Mega Man Universe or the Mega Man Universe was completely omitted because Trombon's a character and Servbots show up there but I also, I will admit I had a similar train of thought is that this whole stuff had me thinking as I thought about, well gee, they cancelled Mega Man Universe 2 and now they've cancelled this and I thought, how come we never got a Mega Man 11?

517
00:40:54,605 --> 00:41:02,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man 9 obviously did crazy good Mega Man 10 I think did alright but I think a lot of people were just like, okay, jokes getting old now

518
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:03,772
[SPEAKER_02]: But, like, I'm a little worried.

519
00:41:03,812 --> 00:41:07,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, does this mean Mega Man at all is done for now?

520
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:11,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I realize the creators left Capcom, so that's a very distinct possibility.

521
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:11,778
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a big deal.

522
00:41:11,798 --> 00:41:13,639
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Katamari games without the creator being there.

523
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's... And none of them really were as good as the original.

524
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:18,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's because they didn't try.

525
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:23,946
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the whole point is, is it that they can't make any of these games or they're just not?

526
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:29,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because if they're not, I don't understand... I mean, get over your guy themselves.

527
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,412
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're just like, well, we don't want his character...

528
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:33,193
[SPEAKER_04]: He left us.

529
00:41:34,234 --> 00:41:35,075
[SPEAKER_04]: He left us.

530
00:41:35,435 --> 00:41:36,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sad.

531
00:41:36,336 --> 00:41:37,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, get over yourself.

532
00:41:37,677 --> 00:41:39,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man's an iconic character.

533
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:43,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think I would be challenged to make the best Mega Man game we've ever made.

534
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:48,786
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to get at him, make the best Mega Man game that anyone's ever seen.

535
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:49,926
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need you anymore.

536
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but... But they did.

537
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:54,870
[SPEAKER_02]: They do need him.

538
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:56,792
[SPEAKER_02]: That's essentially what they're admitting.

539
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:57,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

540
00:41:58,794 --> 00:41:59,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

541
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:00,475
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

542
00:42:01,898 --> 00:42:05,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, let's move on with some more gaming news, I suppose.

543
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:16,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you can always join our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, where a lot of folks kind of going back and forth on this, talking a little bit about the Twitter and how the announcement was handled there on Twitter.

544
00:42:16,162 --> 00:42:19,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not see this, but I guess it was pretty harsh on the Europe Twitter anyway.

545
00:42:20,763 --> 00:42:21,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Yikes.

546
00:42:22,183 --> 00:42:23,744
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, more gaming news here.

547
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:28,145
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a rumor that's been confirmed to be true, and it has to do with...

548
00:42:28,945 --> 00:42:35,871
[SPEAKER_02]: GoldenEye Reloaded, we saw a listing for this on Amazon.com a couple weeks ago and it turns out it is true.

549
00:42:36,192 --> 00:42:39,214
[SPEAKER_02]: The GoldenEye remake is coming out on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

550
00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:41,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Some screenshots were released earlier this week.

551
00:42:42,777 --> 00:42:51,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It is interesting because the game press release didn't even mention the Nintendo 64 original or last year's Wii game.

552
00:42:52,506 --> 00:42:52,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

553
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:55,068
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, the game is coming out.

554
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:58,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel Craig is still playing Bond, not Pierce Brosnan.

555
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:02,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Activision says that the game will run at 60 frames a second.

556
00:43:02,675 --> 00:43:06,097
[SPEAKER_02]: It will support the PlayStation Move sharpshooter gun controller.

557
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:07,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

558
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

559
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also going to support 16 players online.

560
00:43:12,363 --> 00:43:13,463
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii version only supported 8.

561
00:43:14,164 --> 00:43:17,167
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying more maps, weapons, characters, and game modes.

562
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:18,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

563
00:43:18,988 --> 00:43:19,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I concur.

564
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,548
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really, I think, what our issue with that would be.

565
00:43:41,075 --> 00:43:43,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's going to really be the price that this comes out.

566
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:48,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not seeing a price here on the list, so I guess we just have to assume it's probably going to be full price.

567
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:50,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Most likely.

568
00:43:51,909 --> 00:44:00,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hopefully they're smart enough not to release it like a week before Modern Warfare 3 comes out, like the last, you know, Bond game.

569
00:44:00,276 --> 00:44:02,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Release dates are really crucial in gaming.

570
00:44:02,858 --> 00:44:05,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's something we're kind of coming to learn over the past couple years.

571
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

572
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:08,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision, get your shit together.

573
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:12,445
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that you have Modern Warfare 3 coming out the week after.

574
00:44:12,766 --> 00:44:20,152
[SPEAKER_04]: You may think, huh, you know, if we put this game out a week before, we're only going to get maybe one week to have sales because everyone's going to go, oh my god.

575
00:44:21,212 --> 00:44:23,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Modern Warfare 3, who gives a shit about buying this?

576
00:44:25,214 --> 00:44:28,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, this is a game, this Goldeneye Reloaded is a game that should be out now.

577
00:44:29,396 --> 00:44:32,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It should have come out now, because what do we have right now?

578
00:44:32,457 --> 00:44:32,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

579
00:44:33,077 --> 00:44:33,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, nothing.

580
00:44:34,598 --> 00:44:40,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and yes, I realize they want to get a lot of the Christmas sales and so forth, but at the same time, you've got to be real.

581
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at why the one on the Wii didn't do so well.

582
00:44:43,361 --> 00:44:46,743
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't put that out this holiday, because you've got, you know, let's...

583
00:44:47,543 --> 00:44:48,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with September.

584
00:44:48,944 --> 00:44:51,284
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got Gears 3 and Resistance 3 coming out.

585
00:44:51,704 --> 00:44:54,945
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got the following month Battlefield 3 coming out.

586
00:44:54,965 --> 00:44:56,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have Modern Warfare 3.

587
00:44:57,206 --> 00:44:58,687
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to get lost.

588
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:05,289
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to really put that out either in August or you're going to have to wait until winter.

589
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:08,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry about getting it out for holiday.

590
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Or put it out in December.

591
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:13,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's nothing in December.

592
00:45:13,392 --> 00:45:14,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

593
00:45:14,572 --> 00:45:14,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

594
00:45:15,919 --> 00:45:19,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.orangepontrader.com says, I already played the Wii version.

595
00:45:19,981 --> 00:45:21,122
[SPEAKER_02]: No need to play it again.

596
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:26,004
[SPEAKER_02]: But 16 players online and new characters and new maps and HD.

597
00:45:26,205 --> 00:45:26,465
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG.

598
00:45:28,007 --> 00:45:28,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sign me up.

599
00:45:29,108 --> 00:45:36,751
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be really hard to ask somebody to pay $60 twice, though, because the Wii was probably only about $50, but if this one's full price, it'll be $60.

600
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:42,714
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be hard to ask somebody to pay that twice, especially for what was essentially a remake of an old game.

601
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:45,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather see an HD remake of TimeSplitters 2.

602
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:48,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And why that game?

603
00:45:48,576 --> 00:45:49,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that game is awesome.

604
00:45:50,357 --> 00:45:52,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Even TimeSplitters Future Perfect would be awesome.

605
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:54,599
[SPEAKER_04]: It was such a great shooter.

606
00:45:54,979 --> 00:45:55,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

607
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:56,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

608
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:58,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move on with some more news.

609
00:45:58,486 --> 00:45:59,833
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us tonight?

610
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:04,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have some news about Google+, actually.

611
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:09,398
[SPEAKER_07]: They have said that they're going to be getting some gaming features soon.

612
00:46:09,438 --> 00:46:10,959
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually on the Help page.

613
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:20,745
[SPEAKER_07]: According to a few sources, they say that they're going to do something called GameStream, where you can check for updates on the games that you're playing.

614
00:46:21,786 --> 00:46:26,649
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, when it was on there, the link to it now is a 404.

615
00:46:28,795 --> 00:46:28,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.

616
00:46:29,215 --> 00:46:39,502
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but it said that there are some things in the source code that are games get game friends, games get activities, and games post to stream.

617
00:46:40,502 --> 00:46:41,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hmm?

618
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:52,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, this is kind of a duh, especially if you think about that we had news before that Google had invested in Zynga a couple months ago.

619
00:46:52,972 --> 00:46:54,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was maybe more like six months ago.

620
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:57,373
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd invested, what, like $100 million in Zynga?

621
00:46:57,993 --> 00:47:02,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, the fact that games are going to come to Google is a bit of a duh.

622
00:47:03,095 --> 00:47:03,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

623
00:47:03,596 --> 00:47:10,042
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, A, it's about how soon and I think the question that really has everyone wondering is how are they going to implement it?

624
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:12,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this could really make or break Google+.

625
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:16,648
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of folks are really excited about Google+, right now.

626
00:47:16,728 --> 00:47:16,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

627
00:47:17,029 --> 00:47:17,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not Facebook.

628
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:48,097
[SPEAKER_02]: and what Google Plus is doing right is that they're giving people a lot of what Facebook has been very slow or very stubborn to give and that is a decent mobile app for starters once Apple finally approved it let's see they have given folks the control total control over well I shouldn't say total because there's some things about the privacy that even frustrate me too in the pictures department but like you have to have a public profile to keep your account as of the end of the month

629
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:49,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?

630
00:47:49,713 --> 00:48:05,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, actually as of the 27th Interesting I posted that on Google Plus Oh, I missed it But yeah, they said if you're You're in a circle with people I don't read their stuff I'm kidding, I just missed it It can be as little as just your name Yeah But you have to have a public profile

631
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:08,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I, well, I thought you just kind of had one by default.

632
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:10,302
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like Facebook.

633
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:20,065
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a profile, but as long as, you know, you lock everything down, nobody sees anything but your name and your default picture, which doesn't have to be you.

634
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:21,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that's it.

635
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:27,067
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, but they're saying that for people who have them fully private, then their Google Plus accounts are getting wiped.

636
00:48:28,187 --> 00:48:29,288
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they wouldn't wipe.

637
00:48:29,728 --> 00:48:30,328
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it said.

638
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:32,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wouldn't you just change it from private or something?

639
00:48:32,769 --> 00:48:34,010
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems a little ridiculous.

640
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:34,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold a second.

641
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I will get it for you.

642
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:35,671
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

643
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:37,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, share the story because I'm curious about that.

644
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:42,274
[SPEAKER_02]: So then Google might damn themselves on all these, you know, hey, we're going to do privacy right.

645
00:48:42,354 --> 00:48:43,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, oh, well, we're not.

646
00:48:44,495 --> 00:48:46,076
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems a little bit ridiculous to me.

647
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:46,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

648
00:48:46,806 --> 00:48:47,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

649
00:48:48,806 --> 00:48:59,829
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, and this is under the Google Plus project area, public profiles, the purpose of Google profiles is to enable you to manage your online identity.

650
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Today, nearly all Google profiles are public.

651
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:07,651
[SPEAKER_07]: We believe that using Google profiles to help people find and connect with you online is how the product is best used.

652
00:49:08,131 --> 00:49:13,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Private profiles don't allow for this, so we have decided to require all profiles to be public.

653
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:18,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind that your full name is the only required information that will be displayed in your profile.

654
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,959
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be able to edit or remove any other information you don't want to share.

655
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:28,685
[SPEAKER_07]: If you currently have a private profile but you do not wish to make your profile public, you can delete your profile or you can simply do nothing.

656
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:31,408
[SPEAKER_07]: All private profiles will be deleted after July 31st, 2011.

657
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:34,411
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't seem any worse than what Facebook does.

658
00:49:34,831 --> 00:49:39,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean because, okay, so you can have your name and a picture of your cat.

659
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:44,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that doesn't seem so terrible to me.

660
00:49:44,915 --> 00:50:11,762
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are people that are getting kind of Well, because it's a step backwards for Google I think a little bit in the privacy area where everybody's been really I think it kind of feels a little bit like a slap or a step back when everybody's been very rah, rah, rah Circles are the right thing to do Circles are amazing It's the whole reason why Google Plus works Circles are this year's squares Yes, circles are this year's squares Exactly

661
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:24,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as going back to the games implementation though, I think a lot of people are nervous about how are they going to implement games because one reason that people hate Facebook is that they hate the so-and-so is growing bullshit on their farm.

662
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:25,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you come farm with them?

663
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:27,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the invites...

664
00:50:27,822 --> 00:50:31,824
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I'm glad though, on Facebook, they have at least do hide all posts by.

665
00:50:32,184 --> 00:50:36,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and Facebook, I will say a lot of that got better, but it took a long time for that to happen.

666
00:50:37,387 --> 00:50:40,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the question is, how's Google going to implement it, especially if they have a stake in Zynga?

667
00:50:41,248 --> 00:50:48,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, based off of the stuff that's leaked out, it sounds like a gameplay stream will be a totally separate thing.

668
00:50:48,932 --> 00:50:52,254
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would have to click on to view just the game posts.

669
00:50:52,534 --> 00:50:54,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a great way to do it.

670
00:50:54,616 --> 00:51:00,019
[SPEAKER_02]: That way it keeps it out of my main feed where people are posting cute pictures of their cat and status updates.

671
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:05,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just puts it in a place where if I feel like playing a game, then I'll click on that stream and see what's going on.

672
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:10,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't always, believe it or not, I don't always feel like playing a game when I go online.

673
00:51:11,038 --> 00:51:13,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And believe it or not, I don't always care what other people are playing.

674
00:51:13,879 --> 00:51:14,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

675
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially my mother in Farmville.

676
00:51:16,721 --> 00:51:19,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And believe it or not, everybody that sends me an invite for a game, I deny it.

677
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:30,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and all those people, I wish that, this is one thing I wish Facebook had, to have an option where send everyone who sends you an invite a message saying, knock it off.

678
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:38,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And another interesting comment from BlackWolf in our chat room, and this is something I have thought about before, so I guess I'll address it now.

679
00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:43,440
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf says, Sky, one other thing to realize is that they insist on you using your real name.

680
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:45,381
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use a pseudonym, i.e.

681
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:48,562
[SPEAKER_02]: you and me, we are at risk of being suspended from Google+.

682
00:51:48,923 --> 00:51:52,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And to get unsuspended, you would need to send them a photocopy of your government-issued ID.

683
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:53,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

684
00:51:53,785 --> 00:52:01,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of the reason why they're doing that is they're trying to keep the businesses out of profiles right now, and that my name on there isn't fuckyou.

685
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:05,710
[SPEAKER_02]: If my name was Rob Fuck You, I think they might have a problem with that.

686
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:13,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the way I'm doing it on there and the way you're doing it on there, we're kind of okay because we're people that are just trying to protect our privacy.

687
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:17,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think podcasters can be in a very unique situation sometimes.

688
00:52:17,815 --> 00:52:22,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've talked about violations that have happened to my privacy before and how alarming that can be.

689
00:52:22,797 --> 00:52:25,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get into that whole spiel before, but it's scary until you've been there.

690
00:52:26,198 --> 00:52:43,540
[SPEAKER_02]: so here's my thing if Google Plus cancels my account fine I'll stop using it I'm not going to sign up under my real name period but my life will go on without a Google Plus I won't talk about it on this show I'll make my friends go to another website if they want to see my pictures and give another company the ad dollars or what have you like

691
00:52:44,301 --> 00:53:10,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not required to use this website I think it's pretty cool and I'd like to keep using it but there's just some things I'm not going to bend on and what would infuriate me is if Lady Gaga gets a profile on Google Plus that will infuriate me if Lady Gaga gets to have a profile and I would get mine removed because I have to use a fake last name to protect myself from stalkers then that would piss me off

692
00:53:11,736 --> 00:53:12,817
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's a double standard.

693
00:53:12,937 --> 00:53:17,221
[SPEAKER_02]: How come Lady Gaga gets to have a Google Plus profile and not Stephanie Germanotta?

694
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:18,522
[SPEAKER_02]: That would piss me off.

695
00:53:19,303 --> 00:53:20,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely would piss me off.

696
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:24,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Or any other celebrity that doesn't go by their real name, which is most of them.

697
00:53:25,128 --> 00:53:26,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Cher's name isn't Cher, you guys.

698
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Madonna's name.

699
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think her name is Madonna.

700
00:53:29,232 --> 00:53:30,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Katy Perry isn't even Katy Perry.

701
00:53:30,913 --> 00:53:32,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Katy Perry is not Katy Perry.

702
00:53:32,314 --> 00:53:35,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at actors like David Tennant couldn't register under his real name.

703
00:53:36,198 --> 00:53:36,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

704
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:41,521
[SPEAKER_07]: because there was another actor with that name registered with the Actors Guild in the UK.

705
00:53:42,042 --> 00:53:45,844
[SPEAKER_02]: The greatest rock star singer of all fucking time.

706
00:53:46,324 --> 00:53:46,545
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

707
00:53:46,985 --> 00:53:49,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Freddie Mercury was not his real name either.

708
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:52,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Ringo Starr wasn't his name, but he had to legally change.

709
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:53,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

710
00:53:55,391 --> 00:53:57,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how someone in chat changed their name to Rob Fuck You.

711
00:53:59,914 --> 00:54:04,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.org.com says, Rob Fuck You from fucking Austria?

712
00:54:04,837 --> 00:54:04,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

713
00:54:06,063 --> 00:54:07,405
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I would like?

714
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:12,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you have to register your real name, but you can choose a pseudonym.

715
00:54:12,911 --> 00:54:14,272
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

716
00:54:14,472 --> 00:54:15,273
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

717
00:54:17,235 --> 00:54:21,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ranma in chat says, Sky, but what if she legally changes her name to Lady Gaga?

718
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:21,580
[SPEAKER_02]: She hasn't.

719
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:23,682
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

720
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people I meet don't realize I have a different last name.

721
00:54:48,582 --> 00:54:53,826
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to use a different last name on the radio to protect the things I do from 8 to 5 Monday through Friday.

722
00:54:54,126 --> 00:55:00,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but I'm not sharing the details of my job and my life and how I pay my rent and eat.

723
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Because guess what?

724
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:02,732
[SPEAKER_02]: This show doesn't do that.

725
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:06,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Nor any podcast that you listen to unless it's maybe Adam Carolla.

726
00:55:07,415 --> 00:55:09,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Podcasts will not feed somebody.

727
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:13,319
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone gives me a job in exchange for me having to blog about it, then I would do that.

728
00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:13,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

729
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:25,604
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to pay me six digits a year to do this show, or you want us to start charging a subscription fee so that we start making six digits a year off this show, which I still wouldn't think would happen, then I'll happily use my real last name.

730
00:55:27,785 --> 00:55:30,406
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's, you know, that's where it's at.

731
00:55:32,987 --> 00:55:38,351
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow, I didn't mean this to turn into like a stalker privacy conversation, but yeah, games on Google+.

732
00:55:38,631 --> 00:55:41,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you play games on Google+, let me ask that.

733
00:55:41,974 --> 00:55:57,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think if Google has a $100 million stake in Zynga, I think Zynga has a hot new game that they're going to have exclusive on Google+, and I'm talking like Farmville 2 will be like a big land for Google+, which is going to make a lot of people eye roll.

734
00:55:57,546 --> 00:56:00,987
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they launch it the right way, it won't piss everybody off.

735
00:56:01,747 --> 00:56:06,249
[SPEAKER_02]: If they make it so that it's not in your face, people will be fine.

736
00:56:06,289 --> 00:56:07,849
[SPEAKER_02]: But this could make or break Google+.

737
00:56:08,169 --> 00:56:13,691
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's all over and it's Facebook all over again, people will just go right back to Facebook because they have their network built up there.

738
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:19,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, obviously, they have a huge stake in this because with Apple going with big integration with –

739
00:56:19,693 --> 00:56:33,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter, and I'm assuming at some point Facebook or something like that, the Android iOS, or the Android OS, I guess, is going with Google+, since it's a Google-based operating system.

740
00:56:33,872 --> 00:56:34,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense.

741
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it has the phrase on here.

742
00:56:38,871 --> 00:56:42,252
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're looking for updates shared from games, check out your game stream.

743
00:56:42,993 --> 00:56:45,574
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's hope it's all hidden in there.

744
00:56:45,594 --> 00:56:46,194
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

745
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:49,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wouldn't mind playing Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on Google.

746
00:56:49,135 --> 00:56:50,215
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of fun, actually.

747
00:56:51,336 --> 00:56:59,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the whole reason I stopped playing a lot of those stuff, and that's actually why I haven't signed up for Turntable yet, is because Turntable requires you to link through your Facebook.

748
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:02,720
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't like all those apps associated with my Facebook.

749
00:57:03,476 --> 00:57:04,257
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

750
00:57:18,516 --> 00:57:30,180
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't want to, I've seen a lot of people who've signed up for things that I might have been interested in and later on it uses, it'll tag them as a way to advertise their stuff because the tag will show up on your friend's feed.

751
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:30,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

752
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want to be used for something that they're not paying me for.

753
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:34,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

754
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:42,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta say though, I chose to go ahead and go into Turntable FM and I gotta say, that is a rad, it's way better than Spotify.

755
00:57:43,304 --> 00:57:44,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Turntable FM is awesome.

756
00:57:45,362 --> 00:57:48,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I also read something about the legalities, how they're getting away with it.

757
00:57:49,159 --> 00:57:51,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, somebody had posted that to my wall.

758
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:54,944
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't seen Turntable FM, how can I explain Turntable FM real quick?

759
00:57:54,984 --> 00:58:00,528
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically like you and your friends get to play DJ and you can't go in a room by yourself.

760
00:58:00,588 --> 00:58:01,669
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the important thing to know.

761
00:58:02,009 --> 00:58:03,270
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, but you can't do anything.

762
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:12,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Once a friend signs up and it's you and a friend, you can set a queue of songs to play and it'll basically go down the line of up to five DJs and play the next song on your playlist.

763
00:58:13,117 --> 00:58:16,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds so simple, but the great thing about it...

764
00:58:20,284 --> 00:58:21,786
[SPEAKER_02]: After that whole thing you just said?

765
00:58:22,226 --> 00:58:23,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.

766
00:58:23,107 --> 00:58:23,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Liar.

767
00:58:23,848 --> 00:58:26,151
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not a liar, but that's why I'm not doing the games.

768
00:58:27,513 --> 00:58:27,853
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.

769
00:58:28,034 --> 00:58:30,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can always go revoke its permissions at any time.

770
00:58:30,357 --> 00:58:31,318
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing to keep in mind.

771
00:58:31,338 --> 00:58:34,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I spent like an hour doing because the stupid quizzes count as apps.

772
00:58:35,123 --> 00:58:35,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

773
00:58:35,663 --> 00:58:35,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

774
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:53,376
[SPEAKER_02]: so no one's in right now so you would be going into random rooms but like if any of your friends were DJing their little pictures would show up on the right hand side and you go into rooms and just it goes down the line and up to five people just it goes into their playlist and it sounds so simple ooh they're playing Fuel I'm going to the 90s mix it's an awesome way to discover new music

775
00:58:54,176 --> 00:58:55,716
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an awesome way to discover new music.

776
00:58:55,756 --> 00:59:01,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and a couple of my WoW guildies were in there the other night just playing random music that we like and it was cool.

777
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:03,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, have you guys heard this song?

778
00:59:03,959 --> 00:59:04,479
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes up next.

779
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:07,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the legalities, highly questionable.

780
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,440
[SPEAKER_02]: This website probably won't be around in a year, but I'm going to enjoy it while I can.

781
00:59:11,721 --> 00:59:12,161
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

782
00:59:13,263 --> 00:59:15,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on.

783
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:19,067
[SPEAKER_02]: God, we keep bringing up stories and then it just turns into something else completely.

784
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:20,509
[SPEAKER_07]: There, it's on there.

785
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:23,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone has to put up with my music.

786
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:24,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Tangent Radio.

787
00:59:24,372 --> 00:59:24,792
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

788
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:26,613
[SPEAKER_07]: After the show, everyone in my room.

789
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:43,526
[SPEAKER_02]: you should name your room Pillow Fight, DarkSakura's Pillow Fight well but the thing is DarkSakura you can't the way that's set up and the way they do that legality, you can't be the sole DJ you have to be DJing with at least one other person

790
00:59:44,574 --> 00:59:45,555
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura's Pillow Fight

791
01:00:04,784 --> 01:00:07,146
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe it's going to be the next evolution of 3D.

792
01:00:07,286 --> 01:00:21,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, apparently, according to an interview with Develop Magazine, Sony London Studios chief Mick Hawking is talking about some head-mounted 3D displays that they've been showing off at CES.

793
01:00:22,716 --> 01:00:29,441
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're saying that we're working with a couple games at Sony that are experimenting with virtual reality type experiences.

794
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:34,044
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's basically saying that VR could make a comeback.

795
01:00:34,685 --> 01:00:45,498
[SPEAKER_04]: and definitely, you know, I think, yeah, maybe a little bit it could because, you know, remember back in the day, graphics on PCs, not that great.

796
01:00:45,879 --> 01:00:50,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if anyone's seen Lawnmower Man, that's pretty basic stuff.

797
01:00:51,185 --> 01:00:55,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those virtual reality demos back in like 95 and stuff were hilarious.

798
01:00:56,027 --> 01:01:04,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I distinctly remember one to this day where you could either be a dude walking down the street or like in the car and it was like virtual reality.

799
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:08,451
[SPEAKER_02]: You could walk up to these homes that were just giant blocks like it but it was it was awesome.

800
01:01:08,711 --> 01:01:10,912
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing looked like hard driving.

801
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:13,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it seriously was that basic.

802
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,848
[SPEAKER_04]: And nowadays, I mean, who knows when this kind of technology will be coming out.

803
01:01:19,228 --> 01:01:22,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Just technology keeps getting way better and better each year just exponentially.

804
01:01:23,309 --> 01:01:32,492
[SPEAKER_04]: And, I mean, very well in 10 years we could be seeing some sort of 3D virtual reality technology being the kind of standard for gaming and stuff.

805
01:01:32,832 --> 01:01:36,453
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely within the realm of possibility, I suppose.

806
01:01:37,801 --> 01:01:41,245
[SPEAKER_02]: This could definitely, certainly, maybe happen.

807
01:01:42,746 --> 01:01:47,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a distinct, absolute possibility.

808
01:01:49,692 --> 01:01:53,896
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a chance out there that something like this may or may not happen.

809
01:01:57,179 --> 01:01:57,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

810
01:02:00,054 --> 01:02:00,354
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

811
01:02:01,395 --> 01:02:04,278
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving on, I guess.

812
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:04,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

813
01:02:05,178 --> 01:02:09,162
[SPEAKER_02]: What Sony virtual reality stuff could they really make that would be that awesome?

814
01:02:10,203 --> 01:02:17,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they could really enhance home with some virtual reality technology, too.

815
01:02:17,489 --> 01:02:17,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

816
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:19,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Allow more members in your clubs.

817
01:02:22,751 --> 01:02:23,071
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

818
01:02:24,692 --> 01:02:25,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think.

819
01:02:25,213 --> 01:02:34,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking back to there was a peripheral back in the Super Nintendo days that were just basically goggles you could put on your face that were just televisions literally right in front of your face.

820
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:40,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And they called it a virtual reality headset for games like on the Super Nintendo, you know, Faceball 2000.

821
01:02:40,944 --> 01:02:42,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it one time.

822
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,667
[SPEAKER_04]: We played a couple virtual reality games.

823
01:02:45,687 --> 01:02:48,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it wasn't even really virtual reality.

824
01:02:48,029 --> 01:02:51,131
[SPEAKER_04]: It was basically, yes, monitor on my eyes type thing.

825
01:02:51,811 --> 01:03:00,719
[SPEAKER_04]: um but it was at Santa Cruz on the beach boardwalk they had a thing that you could do and you could either play Quake or Duke Nukem 3D

826
01:03:03,435 --> 01:03:03,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

827
01:03:04,075 --> 01:03:05,016
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty awesome.

828
01:03:06,096 --> 01:03:06,357
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

829
01:03:07,977 --> 01:03:08,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

830
01:03:09,058 --> 01:03:10,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate getting on all these tangents.

831
01:03:10,758 --> 01:03:12,139
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something that they have at the boardwalk.

832
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:13,480
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called being on Orange Lounge Radio.

833
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:13,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

834
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:13,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

835
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,321
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something that they have on the boardwalk now.

836
01:03:16,601 --> 01:03:18,402
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called like Safe Crackers.

837
01:03:19,122 --> 01:03:19,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Safe Cracker.

838
01:03:19,983 --> 01:03:27,266
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like some sort of like heist game where you go in a room and you have to dodge lasers kind of like, you know.

839
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:29,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment?

840
01:03:29,729 --> 01:03:30,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly.

841
01:03:30,411 --> 01:03:31,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, you're doing that.

842
01:03:33,015 --> 01:03:33,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game.

843
01:03:33,716 --> 01:03:35,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you're that scene out of Resident Evil.

844
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:38,030
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

845
01:04:01,468 --> 01:04:03,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Catherine Zeta, Spartacus Douglas Jones

846
01:04:23,453 --> 01:04:23,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow.

847
01:04:23,853 --> 01:04:25,154
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he's not my grandfather.

848
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:25,954
[SPEAKER_07]: He's my husband.

849
01:04:28,995 --> 01:04:29,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

850
01:04:29,835 --> 01:04:31,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we need to do a Santa Cruz Boardwalk show.

851
01:04:31,816 --> 01:04:32,596
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a lot of fun.

852
01:04:32,676 --> 01:04:32,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

853
01:04:34,277 --> 01:04:34,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

854
01:04:35,737 --> 01:04:40,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about the Wii U. Yes, it seems like there's new Wii U news every week and it's somebody reacting to it.

855
01:04:40,759 --> 01:04:47,601
[SPEAKER_02]: This week it's Ubisoft is reacting to the Wii U. They must like it because the whole console has a capital U just like their company.

856
01:04:48,342 --> 01:05:00,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they said, Yves Guillemont, who is the Ubisoft CEO, says, We feel this console is coming with very innovative features that will change the video game industry, and we want to be a part of that.

857
01:05:00,933 --> 01:05:03,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that you have a screen very close to you.

858
01:05:03,555 --> 01:05:07,859
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get information and send it as well, but you don't have to learn too many things.

859
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's sending the message that the new transition is going to happen, and we're going to have new machines coming soon.

860
01:05:16,286 --> 01:05:18,311
[SPEAKER_02]: That almost seems like a bad translation to me.

861
01:05:18,691 --> 01:05:21,778
[SPEAKER_02]: You get information and send it but you don't have to learn too many things.

862
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:29,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyhow, speaking of Ubisoft, there's been some clarification, if you will, on Assassin's Creed.

863
01:05:30,203 --> 01:05:32,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not a port of Revelations.

864
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:36,025
[SPEAKER_02]: The game that is coming to the Wii U is an all-new Assassin's Creed title.

865
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It was part of the little Nintendo announcement.

866
01:05:38,906 --> 01:05:43,949
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed a clip of Assassin's Creed, but it's actually going to be an all-new title.

867
01:05:44,609 --> 01:05:47,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that was clarified in the interview.

868
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something new.

869
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:50,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

870
01:05:50,972 --> 01:05:52,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be Assassin's Creed 3?

871
01:05:53,513 --> 01:05:53,813
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

872
01:05:56,499 --> 01:06:00,402
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'll have that screen, and you might be able to keep some information secret.

873
01:06:02,324 --> 01:06:02,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

874
01:06:03,204 --> 01:06:03,384
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

875
01:06:03,645 --> 01:06:07,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, to go back to what I was talking about before.

876
01:06:07,728 --> 01:06:13,752
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game called The Vault, and they have a little bit of gameplay that they're showing.

877
01:06:14,153 --> 01:06:20,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on TV in the lobby or whatever, but you have to have these lights shining through, and you have to dodge them to get to where the vault is in the back.

878
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:21,899
Okay.

879
01:06:23,135 --> 01:06:24,616
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like fun.

880
01:06:24,876 --> 01:06:28,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And they play, you can't hear it, but they have the Mission Impossible music playing.

881
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,101
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually looks kind of rad.

882
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:31,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to lie.

883
01:06:31,962 --> 01:06:32,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to play that.

884
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,884
[SPEAKER_02]: But my fat ass would hit so many lasers.

885
01:06:36,345 --> 01:06:38,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Your gigantic ass just set off five lasers.

886
01:06:39,007 --> 01:06:39,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

887
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:46,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates after this?

888
01:06:47,094 --> 01:06:51,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about the roster for Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3?

889
01:06:52,756 --> 01:06:53,377
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

890
01:06:54,217 --> 01:06:54,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

891
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:57,018
[SPEAKER_07]: It got leaked and Capcom's not denying it.

892
01:06:57,118 --> 01:07:03,381
[SPEAKER_07]: So for Capcom, we have Strider Hear You, Firebrand, Virgil, Frank West, Phoenix Wright, and Nemesis.

893
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:04,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Objection!

894
01:07:05,523 --> 01:07:06,363
[SPEAKER_07]: and Starz.

895
01:07:29,201 --> 01:07:31,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of my favorite characters on the Marvel side, I'm happy.

896
01:07:31,942 --> 01:07:34,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And my favorite character on the Capcom side, I'm happy.

897
01:07:36,043 --> 01:07:43,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Because... Well, you know, back in the day, Dan had a website called Neo Strider's Strider Zone.

898
01:07:44,605 --> 01:07:49,366
[SPEAKER_07]: He had, like, old-style, like, GeoCities-type old webpage.

899
01:07:49,426 --> 01:07:51,267
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did all the graphics for it back in the day.

900
01:07:51,687 --> 01:07:52,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

901
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:53,147
[SPEAKER_07]: When we first got together.

902
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:54,247
[SPEAKER_07]: And so...

903
01:07:57,248 --> 01:08:10,434
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually... He totally got me into the Strider games, but now I'm a big fan of the mostly A-list, but not quite A-list, the pushing B-plus list of Marvel heroes.

904
01:08:11,154 --> 01:08:15,636
[SPEAKER_07]: So my favorite character of all time is Jessica Jones, which I know she's not going to end up in a game, but I can dream.

905
01:08:16,256 --> 01:08:20,778
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I finally get Hawkeye in a game that isn't Captain America and the Avengers.

906
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:22,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And Iron Fist.

907
01:08:23,619 --> 01:08:25,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Iron Fist in a fighting game just makes sense.

908
01:08:25,942 --> 01:08:26,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

909
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:27,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

910
01:08:28,164 --> 01:08:34,750
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think, though, about the whole fact that they're putting out this ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 like not even a year after the first game came out?

911
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, isn't that kind of... The game needed tweaking.

912
01:08:38,473 --> 01:08:39,474
[SPEAKER_07]: It needed tweaking big time.

913
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:40,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It needed free tweaking.

914
01:08:44,715 --> 01:08:50,738
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to admit, this is why people are pissed at Capcom right now about the whole Mega Man Legends 3 thing.

915
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:53,519
[SPEAKER_02]: You get this slap in the face and then you get this slap in the face.

916
01:08:53,599 --> 01:08:54,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

917
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's a slap in the face.

918
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:55,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited.

919
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:57,921
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a slap in the face if you bought the original.

920
01:08:58,021 --> 01:08:59,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I did buy the original and I don't care.

921
01:08:59,362 --> 01:09:00,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I want this one too.

922
01:09:00,222 --> 01:09:00,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

923
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:00,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

924
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:01,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.

925
01:09:02,163 --> 01:09:02,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Hawkeye!

926
01:09:02,783 --> 01:09:03,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this.

927
01:09:03,524 --> 01:09:07,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought Street Fighter 4 on Xbox 360 and then Super Street Fighter 4 is announced.

928
01:09:07,565 --> 01:09:12,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like... Alright, well, I'll get it on PlayStation 3 because at least I know it'll have a better controller.

929
01:09:13,347 --> 01:09:16,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And then... Yeah, and then the Arcade Edition comes out.

930
01:09:16,048 --> 01:09:16,668
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like another $15.

931
01:09:17,048 --> 01:09:18,749
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least that wasn't like a...

932
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:25,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know it was a full retail release, but at least it was compatible with Super Street Fighter.

933
01:09:25,031 --> 01:09:30,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they had a DLC that you could get that basically made it to where... Tournament Stick.

934
01:09:30,572 --> 01:09:31,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was.

935
01:09:31,752 --> 01:09:32,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Worth the money.

936
01:09:32,893 --> 01:09:40,735
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have done that type of stuff with Marvel vs. Capcom 3, except they decided, hey, you know, we're going to be assholes and we're going to put out each character for $5 each.

937
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:43,480
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

938
01:09:43,661 --> 01:09:44,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they only had two of them.

939
01:09:45,082 --> 01:09:48,586
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually... None of the other characters are going to be available as DLC.

940
01:09:49,006 --> 01:09:54,012
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got Shuma Garath and Jill included with this one, and then all of the rest of the characters that I named.

941
01:09:54,993 --> 01:10:00,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw something come out of Comic-Con about other downloadable characters for the game, though.

942
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,181
[SPEAKER_02]: They have costumes.

943
01:10:04,162 --> 01:10:04,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Alternate costumes.

944
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:10,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought there were other characters that showed up at the Comic Con that were like download content or something like that.

945
01:10:10,227 --> 01:10:14,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they've also added in a spectator mode and other new playable content.

946
01:10:15,691 --> 01:10:26,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, they said this, and this is a quote here from Nitsuma, said that it's about half and half between the original download content, the planned download content, and the new content.

947
01:10:26,999 --> 01:10:28,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, it's like you're getting...

948
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:41,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I would look at it as almost a new game, like half a new game with everything else that's going into it.

949
01:10:41,615 --> 01:10:43,176
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, that's how I'm looking at it.

950
01:10:43,216 --> 01:10:46,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you're getting as many new characters as a new fighting game.

951
01:10:48,198 --> 01:10:48,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's true.

952
01:10:49,459 --> 01:10:51,040
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it's down to 40 bucks, too.

953
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,702
[SPEAKER_02]: So those of us who didn't buy the game the first time, like me, now have a reason to.

954
01:10:54,722 --> 01:10:55,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I look at it like a sort of Rock Band 3.

955
01:10:57,233 --> 01:10:57,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

956
01:10:58,094 --> 01:10:58,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

957
01:10:58,334 --> 01:11:04,060
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, your old characters carry over and you get some new ones and new content, new modes.

958
01:11:05,533 --> 01:11:06,053
[SPEAKER_07]: with Rock Band 3.

959
01:11:06,674 --> 01:11:11,416
[SPEAKER_07]: All your songs carry over and you get cymbals and new modes and harmony.

960
01:11:11,537 --> 01:11:12,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And most importantly, the keyboards.

961
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:13,378
[SPEAKER_07]: And keyboard.

962
01:11:13,938 --> 01:11:14,678
[SPEAKER_07]: You get Keyboard Cat.

963
01:11:14,718 --> 01:11:18,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I wouldn't exactly say it's very similar to that because Why not?

964
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:19,541
[SPEAKER_07]: It's exactly the same.

965
01:11:19,821 --> 01:11:20,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

966
01:11:20,121 --> 01:11:22,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the original game is broken.

967
01:11:22,883 --> 01:11:27,786
[SPEAKER_04]: They have issues that they need to fix for the online multiplayer and they're just like, eh, we don't want to do that.

968
01:11:27,806 --> 01:11:28,686
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to release a new game.

969
01:11:29,106 --> 01:11:30,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Band's got issues online.

970
01:11:31,127 --> 01:11:35,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't play online, so I honestly personally, I don't give a shit about the online play Then it's their problem

971
01:11:57,584 --> 01:11:58,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no problem with it.

972
01:11:58,805 --> 01:12:00,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's Capcom's problem.

973
01:12:00,026 --> 01:12:01,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a quick note for the live listeners only.

974
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Fire beware.

975
01:12:02,848 --> 01:12:05,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what happened, but Winamp crashed, so unfortunately you missed that little argument.

976
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:08,651
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll have to tune into the podcast to hear that.

977
01:12:09,232 --> 01:12:11,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki and DarkSakura just got in a little heated discussion about that.

978
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:18,698
[SPEAKER_07]: But Winamp crashed, so it's... Loki was having an uncharacteristic caring for other people, and I didn't give a shit.

979
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,021
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not uncharacteristic for me.

980
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:24,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I care about other people.

981
01:12:24,922 --> 01:12:25,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, myself, and I. It's...

982
01:12:28,621 --> 01:12:32,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the last game I played online was Fable 2 on Xbox Live I'm not sure there's going to be a patch

983
01:12:57,911 --> 01:12:59,192
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there will not be a patch.

984
01:12:59,212 --> 01:13:01,993
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're going to announce a new game, why would they fix the old game?

985
01:13:03,914 --> 01:13:04,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

986
01:13:04,374 --> 01:13:05,495
[SPEAKER_02]: The old game is done.

987
01:13:06,295 --> 01:13:09,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that they've announced this, there's nothing new going to come to the old game.

988
01:13:09,236 --> 01:13:11,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And back to this, it's not Capcom's fucking problem.

989
01:13:12,058 --> 01:13:13,659
[SPEAKER_07]: People are going to pay for the game.

990
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:20,342
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to sell it because people love Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and I love Hawkeye, so I'm getting the game.

991
01:13:20,822 --> 01:13:24,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say your Rock Band comparison makes a lot of sense.

992
01:13:26,323 --> 01:13:35,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't know if I would really be happy that it's all happening in the same year, but that was probably the best argument I've heard for Capcom.

993
01:13:35,391 --> 01:13:42,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get why people are messed up over it, and yeah, I get it, but at the same time, they're gonna make their money.

994
01:13:43,097 --> 01:13:45,479
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Capcom's problem, it's the consumer's problem.

995
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only way it's going to be made Capcom's problem is if the consumer does not follow through.

996
01:13:50,202 --> 01:13:51,802
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right, this isn't Capcom's problem.

997
01:13:51,842 --> 01:13:57,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, you know, it wasn't Activision's problem that DJ Hero 1 didn't have any download content because, you know, they decided, hey, you know what?

998
01:13:57,964 --> 01:14:04,486
[SPEAKER_04]: We're instead of, you know, supporting it with download content like we said we were, we're just going to, I don't know, put out a new game.

999
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:08,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now, Loki, there were like nine songs you could download for DJ Hero 1.

1000
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:14,668
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that was nine pieces of download content that you could get.

1001
01:14:15,088 --> 01:14:18,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Konami and Dance Dance Revolution, you know?

1002
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:20,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, yeah, we're gonna support this game.

1003
01:14:20,932 --> 01:14:26,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we said we're gonna support the last game with download content, but I promise you we're gonna support this game with download content.

1004
01:14:28,398 --> 01:14:29,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's your one piece of download content.

1005
01:14:30,559 --> 01:14:55,861
[SPEAKER_04]: um you know it's it's just like that or and you may remember what happened to you know Guitar Hero where there wasn't as much download content but hey you know what we released these song packs because that's what the fans want they want all their characters and all this cool spectator mode and alternate stuff because you know what um I really need an Elvis costume for my fucking characters that's really canon for Marvel um that's gonna be really awesome so

1006
01:14:58,208 --> 01:14:58,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking forward to it.

1007
01:14:59,089 --> 01:15:12,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and by the way, not to nitpick here a little bit, Capcom, but your game Street Fighter vs. Tekken, or Street Fighter X Tekken, I know that you've added other Capcom characters.

1008
01:15:12,798 --> 01:15:13,919
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not part of Street Fighter.

1009
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:15,099
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to change the fucking title.

1010
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:16,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey, I'm not to that story yet.

1011
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,281
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to wait.

1012
01:15:17,521 --> 01:15:18,722
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to sit and hold that rant.

1013
01:15:19,462 --> 01:15:21,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we gotta go to some release dates.

1014
01:15:22,204 --> 01:15:24,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Travel around the world to talk about what's coming out to a store near you.

1015

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Pac-Man Galaga Dimensions, that's for the 3DS.

[SPEAKER_04]: And the Sims 3 Town Life stuff expansion is going to be coming out on PC.

1021
01:16:35,621 --> 01:16:37,343
[SPEAKER_04]: That's literally it.

1022
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's that dead.

1023
01:16:40,203 --> 01:16:40,563
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1024
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:45,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then let's go to the Xbox 360 in Japan and talk about what's coming out there.

1025
01:16:45,646 --> 01:16:53,731
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, Operation Flashpoint Red River comes out this week, as well as Dungeon Siege 3 gets its Japanese release this week.

1026
01:16:53,811 --> 01:16:54,411
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it on the 360.

1027
01:16:55,972 --> 01:16:57,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two games, of course, on the 28th.

1028
01:16:57,693 --> 01:17:01,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the PlayStation 3, Dungeon Siege 3 there as well.

1029
01:17:01,556 --> 01:17:03,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Operation Flashpoint there as well.

1030
01:17:03,137 --> 01:17:04,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And a game called Fit in 6.

1031
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:08,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Karada o Kiteru Siksu no Yosu

1032
01:17:33,469 --> 01:17:34,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, then there you go.

1033
01:17:35,172 --> 01:17:39,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to, I want to see if there's anything on the handhelds real quick, or maybe anything in Nintendo's world.

1034
01:17:40,379 --> 01:17:48,711
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sony PSP has Queensgate Spiral Chaos comes out this week in regular and limited, or I guess like a special edition.

1035
01:17:49,471 --> 01:17:51,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Queensgate is an RPG.

1036
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:53,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Become the queen of a dimension.

1037
01:17:53,494 --> 01:17:55,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Harness the power of the Queensgate.

1038
01:17:55,555 --> 01:17:59,718
[SPEAKER_02]: The door that connects to all game worlds is taken over by someone evil and ambitious.

1039
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:04,922
[SPEAKER_02]: This game includes Mai from King of Fighters and the ladies from Queensblade.

1040
01:18:04,962 --> 01:18:11,086
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of like a Worlds Collide type of game where there's other chicks from other series.

1041
01:18:11,426 --> 01:18:13,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like a farting maid.

1042
01:18:13,207 --> 01:18:15,329
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what that looks like to me in that picture.

1043
01:18:16,309 --> 01:18:17,770
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going, poot, and it says hip.

1044
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:18,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.

1045
01:18:19,392 --> 01:18:20,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Who farts with the sound hip?

1046
01:18:21,335 --> 01:18:21,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Hip!

1047
01:18:22,737 --> 01:18:23,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she's swinging her hips.

1048
01:18:23,879 --> 01:18:25,682
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going poop with her hips.

1049
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:27,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Be one of those loud whine poops.

1050
01:18:27,825 --> 01:18:30,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's plenty enough.

1051
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:32,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I just made it with my mouth.

1052
01:18:32,987 --> 01:18:35,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Fit and Six, also coming out on the Wii in Japan, if you care.

1053
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:38,492
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 3DS, Super Pokemon Scramble.

1054
01:18:38,512 --> 01:18:39,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember mentioning that last week.

1055
01:18:39,734 --> 01:18:43,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, a Pokemon game on the 3DS, even though it's not the Pokemon game.

1056
01:18:44,698 --> 01:18:47,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Pokemon Dynasty Warriors.

1057
01:18:48,302 --> 01:18:54,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, on the Nintendo DS, Devil Survivor 2 from Atlus this week on the regular DS, non-3D flavor.

1058
01:18:55,529 --> 01:18:56,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, how about the UK?

1059
01:18:57,509 --> 01:18:58,370
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a few things.

1060
01:18:58,891 --> 01:19:12,569
[SPEAKER_07]: We have on the 26th Call of Juarez the Cartel for PC and Dragon Age 2 Legacy for PS3, PC, Xbox 360 and on the 27th Project Dust from Ubisoft on Xbox 360.

1061
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,512
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.

1062
01:19:15,553 --> 01:19:18,495
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1063
01:19:18,555 --> 01:19:26,381
[SPEAKER_04]: But first... But first, there was a person that had the domain for ModernWarfare3.com.

1064
01:19:27,982 --> 01:19:34,547
[SPEAKER_04]: They were somewhat anonymous via GoDaddy's domains by proxy hiding surface.

1065
01:19:34,747 --> 01:19:38,950
[SPEAKER_02]: We use that, by the way, for our own website.

1066
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:42,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, a domain dispute from ModernWarfare3's publisher

1067
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:46,255
[SPEAKER_04]: and Activision has dissolved that shield.

1068
01:19:47,235 --> 01:20:10,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now apparently known that it is owned by a guy from Florida named Anthony Abram and he is now doing a bunch of random things with the website including he was at one time redirecting it to Battlefield 3's main site and also spoofing Modern Warfare 3's official site and

1069
01:20:11,571 --> 01:20:12,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1070
01:20:29,502 --> 01:20:33,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I love how that's... I mean, granted that this guy, yeah, he is a troll.

1071
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:39,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And he is... You registered the domain name because he knows that Activision is going to have a Modern Warfare 3 game at some point.

1072
01:20:40,571 --> 01:20:43,032
[SPEAKER_04]: That being said, I still think he should have the website.

1073
01:20:43,673 --> 01:20:50,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because that, you know, Activision has a game... Like, you know, for example, if I registered a website that's like...

1074
01:20:51,699 --> 01:20:53,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1075
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:55,662
[SPEAKER_04]: AwesomeSauce.com or something like that.

1076
01:20:56,182 --> 01:20:58,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just assume that there's no such thing as Awesome Sauce.

1077
01:20:59,404 --> 01:21:01,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Some person out there decides, hey, you know what?

1078
01:21:01,726 --> 01:21:03,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Billy Mitchell will do it.

1079
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:07,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Heinz57 is going to come out with Awesome Sauce and we want that domain.

1080
01:21:08,391 --> 01:21:10,172
[SPEAKER_04]: You give it to us because we want it.

1081
01:21:10,792 --> 01:21:14,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that because you want something in your company that you should get that.

1082
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:20,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you should have registered that domain a long time ago then.

1083
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:28,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, Activision, I don't know what to tell you, but back when you were doing Modern Warfare 2, I could have told you that there was going to be a Modern Warfare 3.

1084
01:21:28,462 --> 01:21:31,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's just...

1085
01:21:32,105 --> 01:21:32,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Dumb.

1086
01:21:34,186 --> 01:21:42,949
[SPEAKER_02]: He should have done the smarter thing, and he should have had some type of club or something that was like the name Modern Warfare or something, if he wanted to be smarter about it.

1087
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:45,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for instance, I remember reading about this.

1088
01:21:46,311 --> 01:21:58,176
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy who owns, or at least did own, I don't know if he still does, I haven't checked it in years, but Sting.com, the musician Sting tried to sue the guy who owns it because he wanted the domain because he is the celebrity Sting.

1089
01:21:58,516 --> 01:22:00,177
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows that name.

1090
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:01,977
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

1091
01:22:25,606 --> 01:22:27,307
[SPEAKER_02]: That he had every right to the name.

1092
01:22:27,387 --> 01:22:29,207
[SPEAKER_02]: That if Sting wanted it, he should have got it first.

1093
01:22:29,788 --> 01:22:35,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think to the argument of this guy, Modern Warfare 3, that's not the title of the game.

1094
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:36,850
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the subtitle of the game.

1095
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,691
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.

1096
01:22:39,351 --> 01:22:41,712
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not like Hello Kitty Modern Warfare 3.

1097
01:22:42,152 --> 01:22:43,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Call of Duty.

1098
01:22:43,673 --> 01:22:47,034
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, you know, if he had his website was...

1099
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:49,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3.

1100
01:22:49,246 --> 01:22:54,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think there's a problem there because now you're infringing on, you know, the intellectual properties of Activision.

1101
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:55,909
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is just trolling.

1102
01:22:56,409 --> 01:22:58,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, you know, Whitehouse.com.

1103
01:22:58,591 --> 01:22:59,451
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a porn site.

1104
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:01,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it was a porn site.

1105
01:23:01,512 --> 01:23:01,772
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?

1106
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:03,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Too fucking bad.

1107
01:23:04,033 --> 01:23:10,697
[SPEAKER_04]: If the Whitehouse can't get a goddamn URL, then Activision should not get a goddamn URL.

1108
01:23:10,937 --> 01:23:11,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

1109
01:23:11,357 --> 01:23:25,740
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the guy was just trolling and has no legitimate purpose to have that title, just like these people that – like what some person sat on JuliaRoberts.com and tried to basically sell it back to her for like $10,000.

1110
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,800
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just embezzlement.

1111
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:28,641
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not doing that.

1112
01:23:28,701 --> 01:23:30,001
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just being an asshole.

1113
01:23:30,261 --> 01:23:30,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not embezzlement.

1114
01:23:31,181 --> 01:23:31,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1115
01:23:31,761 --> 01:23:33,822
[SPEAKER_02]: He has the right to be an asshole on the internet.

1116
01:23:33,882 --> 01:23:34,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1117
01:23:35,842 --> 01:23:36,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he does.

1118
01:23:37,163 --> 01:23:38,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in this case.

1119
01:23:38,464 --> 01:23:45,349
[SPEAKER_02]: If he has no legitimate purpose for holding that website, I don't think he... I'm just saying he wasn't smart about how he used it.

1120
01:23:45,849 --> 01:23:46,650
[SPEAKER_02]: He should have used it.

1121
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:55,576
[SPEAKER_02]: If he wanted to, he could have had a dissertation about how Modern Warfare 3 is going to be a terrible game or had it be a review on Modern Warfare 3 and I think he would have had more of a say.

1122
01:23:56,316 --> 01:24:14,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know it just you know I think if you're not going to use it for anything worthwhile there's that committee that'll say you bring nothing good to the internet we're shutting you down SSJ100 Matt fuck you in the chat yes he changed his name to that says I'm going to register orange lounge radio 2.com

1123
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:45,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, here's what Have fun Modern Warfare 2's official website is modernwarfare2.infinitywar.com Oh, well, I guess I can't use that anymore Oh, damn But, I mean, they have a callofduty.com They could easily do a callofduty slash modernwarfare3 or they can do mw3 since that's how it's displayed on the box I mean, there's plenty of things out there What's on that website right now if you try to go to it?

1124
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:50,083
[SPEAKER_04]: What if he did ModernWarfare3.net or something like that?

1125
01:24:50,443 --> 01:24:51,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that going to still be an issue?

1126
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to the website right now if this autoplays anything.

1127
01:24:54,206 --> 01:24:55,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, it's a totally blank page.

1128
01:24:58,168 --> 01:24:59,209
[SPEAKER_02]: No source code or nothing.

1129
01:25:02,349 --> 01:25:06,290
[SPEAKER_02]: ModernWarfare2.com was a website and it's a Modern Warfare 2 fan site or something.

1130
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:07,750
[SPEAKER_02]: What if I go and register ModernWarfare4.com?

1131
01:25:31,977 --> 01:25:32,637
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they going to do?

1132
01:25:34,938 --> 01:25:38,920
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to put some stupid articles about Modern Warfare like, you know, hey, there's guns.

1133
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:46,963
[SPEAKER_02]: You should go register MegaManLegends3.com right now since you know no one else is going to use it now.

1134
01:25:47,523 --> 01:25:49,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a MegaManLegends3.com?

1135
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:49,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1136
01:25:54,974 --> 01:25:55,474
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1137
01:26:05,265 --> 01:26:10,188
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been going on since the early .com business days too.

1138
01:26:10,969 --> 01:26:12,190
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing new.

1139
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:14,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys need to be tossed out immediately.

1140
01:26:15,032 --> 01:26:19,535
[SPEAKER_02]: If I show that I have a legitimate business purpose, those guys need to get tossed.

1141
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:22,237
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's ModernWarfare4.com with a clown on it.

1142
01:26:23,137 --> 01:26:25,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to ModernWarfare4.com website.

1143
01:26:25,599 --> 01:26:28,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It would appear that Infinity Ward forgot to purchase this domain.

1144
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:32,524
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries, we have good... Of course, they have no spelling.

1145
01:26:33,044 --> 01:26:34,265
[SPEAKER_04]: We have good care of it.

1146
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:39,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this an extortion plot too?

1147
01:26:40,114 --> 01:26:46,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we breaking the story here that there is this whole time there's been a ModernWarfare4.com?

1148
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:49,344
[SPEAKER_02]: You've all been focused on Modern Warfare 3 all week?

1149
01:26:49,945 --> 01:26:52,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a Modern Warfare 4 out there.

1150
01:26:52,107 --> 01:26:52,968
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a 5.

1151
01:26:53,128 --> 01:26:53,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to register 5.

1152
01:26:55,571 --> 01:26:56,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Modern Warfare 5.

1153
01:26:56,572 --> 01:26:57,293
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mine.

1154
01:26:58,114 --> 01:26:58,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get it quick.

1155
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:02,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Use a GoDaddy registration code to do that.

1156
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, we're not sponsored by GoDaddy.

1157
01:27:05,122 --> 01:27:06,542
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be hilarious.

1158
01:27:07,283 --> 01:27:07,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

1159
01:27:09,484 --> 01:27:10,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the domain.

1160
01:27:12,966 --> 01:27:13,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Could someone register?

1161
01:27:13,946 --> 01:27:17,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Would somebody be willing to spend the 20 bucks to register ModernWarfare5.com?

1162
01:27:17,068 --> 01:27:19,949
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even 20 bucks, it's 10.

1163
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:19,949
$10.

1164
01:27:20,369 --> 01:27:22,751
[SPEAKER_02]: What would we point it to if we bought ModernWarfare5.com right now?

1165
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:23,211
[SPEAKER_02]: The Ooga Booga site.

1166
01:27:23,231 --> 01:27:23,331
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1167
01:27:28,246 --> 01:27:30,873
[SPEAKER_04]: We can make some really fake looking box art or something.

1168
01:27:31,374 --> 01:27:32,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Nerf fansite.

1169
01:27:33,038 --> 01:27:34,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Modern Warfare with Nerf.

1170
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:36,511
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Nerf and Nerf

1171
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:07,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I've actually got not just the Nerf sword, the broadsword, I have the axe and the mace.

1172
01:28:09,423 --> 01:28:10,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a bunch of Nerf guns.

1173
01:28:12,183 --> 01:28:13,204
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of Nerf guns.

1174
01:28:14,044 --> 01:28:14,684
[SPEAKER_07]: And the orange bat.

1175
01:28:15,685 --> 01:28:15,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1176
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:18,305
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Streetfighter5.com?

1177
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:23,130
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because Capcom won't have that out for another 10 years.

1178
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, see, Actdeft.

1179
01:28:24,831 --> 01:28:25,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that thought.

1180
01:28:25,811 --> 01:28:28,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says redirect it to President Cat.

1181
01:28:31,592 --> 01:28:32,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Send it to the Renowee Twitter.

1182
01:28:33,052 --> 01:28:33,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

1183
01:28:37,393 --> 01:28:37,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

1184
01:28:38,573 --> 01:28:39,753
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a really good idea.

1185
01:28:39,793 --> 01:28:40,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

1186
01:28:42,094 --> 01:28:43,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Eason said it should go to the NRA.

1187
01:28:43,974 --> 01:28:44,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it this way.

1188
01:28:44,734 --> 01:28:50,195
[SPEAKER_04]: If Professor Genki is so popular in Saints Row 3, President Cat should easily be able to come out over here.

1189
01:28:52,973 --> 01:28:54,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a footnote and word of warning.

1190
01:28:54,734 --> 01:29:00,755
[SPEAKER_02]: If you register Modern Warfare 5 and give it to us to put our pictures of nerf fights on, if you get sued, that's on you.

1191
01:29:01,055 --> 01:29:04,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I disavow every knowledge that this conversation ever happened.

1192
01:29:07,537 --> 01:29:12,938
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100MattFuckYou says, Rob, we really should register a Dance Dance Revolution site and see if Konami gives a shit.

1193
01:29:12,978 --> 01:29:13,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't mind trolling them.

1194
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:22,674
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you did it as COD Modern Warfare 5 and you're fighting with cods, like fish.

1195
01:29:23,874 --> 01:29:28,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Like actual trout slapping IRL, like MIRC.

1196
01:29:28,997 --> 01:29:29,878
[SPEAKER_02]: It could just be pictures.

1197
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:34,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Skye slaps DarkSakura with a trout and it would be actually me slapping her with a trout.

1198
01:29:37,202 --> 01:29:38,223
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be hilarious.

1199
01:29:38,743 --> 01:29:40,104
[SPEAKER_07]: That would not be hilarious.

1200
01:29:40,804 --> 01:29:41,685
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be smelly.

1201
01:29:42,645 --> 01:29:43,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

1202
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:45,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of smelly... No, I got nothing.

1203
01:29:46,613 --> 01:29:48,434
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got... Actually, this might be kind of smelly.

1204
01:29:48,454 --> 01:29:52,316
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the character Poison from Final Fight?

1205
01:29:52,557 --> 01:29:53,457
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean the transgender?

1206
01:29:54,558 --> 01:29:55,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Is she really?

1207
01:29:55,619 --> 01:29:55,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1208
01:29:56,739 --> 01:29:57,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Poison's transgender?

1209
01:29:58,140 --> 01:29:58,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1210
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:58,560
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1211
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:04,184
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually is officially said way back in an old interview with one of the game designers.

1212
01:30:05,565 --> 01:30:11,148
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to be because they couldn't make her a woman in the game because it wasn't right to hit a woman.

1213
01:30:11,289 --> 01:30:13,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why they made her a man.

1214
01:30:14,924 --> 01:30:17,650
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they changed the character sprite in the US.

1215
01:30:18,391 --> 01:30:21,558
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think in other places they gave her a longer skirt and covered up her boob.

1216
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:26,288
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, officially Poison is supposed to be transgendered.

1217
01:30:26,858 --> 01:30:27,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Dalsim, Steve Fox, Yoshimitsu

1218
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, Steve Fox is kind of fun.

1219
01:30:48,343 --> 01:30:49,464
[SPEAKER_02]: All announced as characters.

1220
01:30:49,484 --> 01:30:52,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if Poison would whip out her dick and smack people.

1221
01:30:55,186 --> 01:30:55,646
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1222
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:56,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Special attack surprise.

1223
01:30:56,946 --> 01:30:59,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all for a diverse character lineup in the game.

1224
01:30:59,207 --> 01:31:00,488
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

1225
01:31:00,808 --> 01:31:05,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that if it's Street Fighter cross Tekken, she's a Final Fight character.

1226
01:31:05,309 --> 01:31:06,370
[SPEAKER_02]: And okay, I get it.

1227
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:09,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Guy, Cody, they kind of crossed over too.

1228
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:13,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But does that mean everybody from Final Fight is now part of the Street Fighter canon?

1229
01:31:13,812 --> 01:31:17,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't Poison be in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3?

1230
01:31:20,094 --> 01:31:21,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a download character.

1231
01:31:21,234 --> 01:31:21,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1232
01:31:22,255 --> 01:31:27,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seems like a strange pick to me with so many characters in the Street Fighter universe.

1233
01:31:27,316 --> 01:31:35,259
[SPEAKER_02]: But okay, they want to bring back or maybe somebody really wants to put... It's because they're super Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1234
01:31:35,419 --> 01:31:38,320
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what sucks is now I have that song running through my head.

1235
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,280
[SPEAKER_07]: That Belle Biv DeVoe song.

1236
01:31:41,741 --> 01:31:42,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Good lord.

1237
01:31:43,684 --> 01:31:46,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

1238
01:31:46,925 --> 01:31:52,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was at a panel, by the way, at Comic-Con 2011 where it was announced that those characters would be in the game.

1239
01:31:52,906 --> 01:31:58,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess Hugo, Cody, and Guy have also been teased for the game.

1240
01:31:58,727 --> 01:32:03,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that would make sense if Poison's in it, that Guy and Cody are going to show up at some point as well.

1241
01:32:03,868 --> 01:32:06,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, I wonder how many characters this game's supposed to have.

1242
01:32:06,569 --> 01:32:07,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.

1243
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:16,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go, all characters that are set to come out in Street Fighter X Tekken, which is a game that I'm pretty excited about actually.

1244
01:32:16,347 --> 01:32:20,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't Chico supposed to be like Andori, who was actually based off of Andre the Giant?

1245
01:32:21,531 --> 01:32:21,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah?

1246
01:32:22,432 --> 01:32:24,774
[SPEAKER_07]: But they changed his name because of the state.

1247
01:32:26,015 --> 01:32:29,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh right, I remember those characters that looked just like Andre the Giant.

1248
01:32:29,859 --> 01:32:30,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1249
01:32:31,858 --> 01:32:32,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny.

1250
01:32:32,799 --> 01:32:33,039
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1251
01:32:33,899 --> 01:32:37,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to the classic game of the week.

1252
01:32:37,361 --> 01:32:38,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1253
01:32:38,641 --> 01:32:41,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we like to take a trip down memory lane.

1254
01:32:41,983 --> 01:32:42,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my theme music?

1255
01:32:43,784 --> 01:32:45,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Have I lost the theme music?

1256
01:32:46,585 --> 01:32:47,626
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big deal.

1257
01:32:49,186 --> 01:32:49,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the theme music?

1258
01:32:50,647 --> 01:32:51,087
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

1259
01:32:53,328 --> 01:32:53,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1260
01:32:53,808 --> 01:32:56,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to be in a very bad mood if I couldn't hear this happy music.

1261
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:56,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1262
01:32:57,273 --> 01:33:05,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Classic Game of the Week is a chance for us to walk down memory lane and check out a game that DarkSakura thinks, hey, you kids should be playing this game right now.

1263
01:33:05,963 --> 01:33:06,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck finding one.

1264
01:33:08,466 --> 01:33:10,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, regardless, here it is, your Classic Game of the Week.

1265
01:33:12,299 --> 01:33:20,647
[SPEAKER_07]: The classic game of the week is Planet Harriers, which I brought up at the beginning of the show, and I've brought up constantly throughout past shows.

1266
01:33:21,067 --> 01:33:24,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm finally reviewing it, because damn it, this game is awesome!

1267
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:36,381
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is part of the Space Harrier series, and it has a twin cabinet, so two people can play at the same time, or you can do a networked two-player game, and you actually play seeded.

1268
01:33:36,961 --> 01:33:38,523
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's controlled through a joystick.

1269
01:33:38,543 --> 01:33:44,630
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a missile and a bullet trigger and you can change your views and you have bomb buttons all on the main panel.

1270
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:46,612
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can choose either four characters.

1271
01:33:46,752 --> 01:33:55,201
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Glenn, X, Corey or Nick and basically they fly on the screen and you are behind them so it's that...

1272
01:33:56,022 --> 01:34:01,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of third-person style, but not quite.

1273
01:34:01,805 --> 01:34:05,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in two-player mode, you actually can dock together to save your life.

1274
01:34:05,787 --> 01:34:11,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has the Opa-Opa in it, because you cannot have a game in the Fantasy Zone without the Opa-Opa.

1275
01:34:13,192 --> 01:34:26,675
[SPEAKER_07]: So this game, a little bit more information about it is that it actually was on the Hikaru system, which was basically a double mountain.

1276
01:34:27,255 --> 01:34:32,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And you don't play versus, you play as a team to clear off the screen.

1277
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:36,797
[SPEAKER_07]: And your joystick is an eight-way stick, and it's stereo sound.

1278
01:34:36,957 --> 01:34:39,177
[SPEAKER_07]: And the game came out in 2001.

1279
01:34:39,397 --> 01:34:41,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know the last place that I saw one at was at Great America?

1280
01:34:42,678 --> 01:34:43,779
[SPEAKER_07]: When we went to see Margaret Cho.

1281
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:46,360
[SPEAKER_02]: They had that there?

1282
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,181
[SPEAKER_02]: They had that there.

1283
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:47,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1284
01:34:47,841 --> 01:34:48,362
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

1285
01:34:48,922 --> 01:34:58,307
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remembered because, oh, the female character that you can play, basically, she wears a nurse's outfit and shoots a giant syringe as her weapon.

1286
01:34:59,048 --> 01:35:07,193
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also cool because the final boss in this game will turn into a variety of different shapes, like it'll be a fish or waves.

1287
01:35:07,313 --> 01:35:09,454
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things it turns into is the Dreamcast logo.

1288
01:35:10,174 --> 01:35:10,775
[SPEAKER_07]: The little squirrel.

1289
01:35:12,082 --> 01:35:22,785
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I mean, it's basically you, you know, you have obstacles in your way, and when you're actually on the ground, you're running on the ground like in Space Harrier, but when you're in the air, you're shooting.

1290
01:35:23,386 --> 01:35:29,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's got great music, it's got great graphics for 2001, and it only ever came out in the arcade.

1291
01:35:29,168 --> 01:35:32,168
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a talk of them doing a Dreamcast port.

1292
01:35:32,389 --> 01:35:33,069
[SPEAKER_07]: It never happened.

1293
01:35:33,889 --> 01:35:41,332
[SPEAKER_07]: which I don't see why they didn't because it would be super easy given, you know, how high the Dreamcast is basically now on me.

1294
01:35:42,813 --> 01:35:52,196
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that I liked about this one too, and it's actually the part that you just got to in the video, Rob, is it has a shop like in Fantasy Zone.

1295
01:35:52,596 --> 01:35:54,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say it reminds me of Fantasy Zone.

1296
01:35:54,676 --> 01:36:07,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so you can go in and you buy like big bombs or more speed or more shield and you use it to power yourself up as you go along because you're also collecting your points and your money as you go along too.

1297
01:36:07,661 --> 01:36:18,206
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just a really neat game and they didn't really I think make a whole lot of them and it kind of died out so there's no home version of this.

1298
01:36:18,846 --> 01:36:26,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I've been trying to find it emulated, and from what I understand, what was it that I downloaded today?

1299
01:36:27,314 --> 01:36:35,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, the main .14164 bit runs it, but I don't think very well.

1300
01:36:36,441 --> 01:36:42,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been able to find much more else about the emulation, but really that's the only way that you're probably going to be able to play it, unless you happen to know where one is.

1301
01:36:42,987 --> 01:36:51,177
[SPEAKER_07]: and if you know where one is, tell me so that I can go play it I was so pissed off when we went to the Sega Arcade in Seattle to Gameworks and they did not have a Planet Harrier

1302
01:36:52,443 --> 01:37:02,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you were going to buy the former Sunrise Fun Center and make it your bitch and you were going to put all these great games in that place You know what, when I have money I'll be doing that

1303
01:37:22,913 --> 01:37:38,653
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe in 2035 But that is the classic game There it is, Planet Harrier Your classic game of the week The seat is plastic Your classic game of the week

1304
01:37:39,266 --> 01:37:41,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we got plenty more show to go, but don't go anywhere.

1305
01:37:41,867 --> 01:37:50,372
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be right back after this quick break with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including more news on things like Minecraft and Child of Eden on the PlayStation 3.

1306
01:37:50,432 --> 01:37:52,853
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to talk about Zynga getting sued.

1307
01:37:53,334 --> 01:37:53,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1308
01:37:54,174 --> 01:37:58,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, your calls and, so excited, a list list tonight.

1309
01:37:58,436 --> 01:37:59,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1310
01:37:59,537 --> 01:38:04,340
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do a list list tonight when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1311
01:38:10,771 --> 01:38:33,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back everybody to episode number 421 of Orange Lounge Radio live on this July the 24th of 2011 as we are live of course every week Sunday nights at All Games Radio www.allgames.com and there's lots of great stuff you can't tune in on Sunday nights you should listen to allgames.com throughout the week there's a lot of other great shows many of them live that tape throughout the week so check that out.

1312
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:34,501
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1313
01:38:52,415 --> 01:38:53,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm equipped.

1314
01:39:07,988 --> 01:39:18,339
[SPEAKER_02]: and what it's basically getting at is that there's a large LAN party that happens in Texas and it's being organized to celebrate the launch of Battlefield 3 which is this big game that's being launched and so forth.

1315
01:39:18,999 --> 01:39:28,269
[SPEAKER_02]: They've decided that the best way to deal with slurs that end up getting hurled at female gamers at these events is to just prevent women from attending.

1316
01:39:28,909 --> 01:39:32,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So no women will be allowed to attend this event in Texas.

1317
01:39:33,293 --> 01:39:35,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read a quote from the FAQ.

1318
01:39:35,294 --> 01:39:39,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1319
01:39:39,277 --> 01:39:41,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1320
01:39:41,719 --> 01:39:53,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, Nothing ruins a good LAN party like uncomfortable guests or lots of tension, both of which can result from mixing immature, misogynistic male gamers with female counterparts.

1321
01:39:54,229 --> 01:39:59,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Though we've done our best to avoid these situations in years past, we've certainly had our share of problems.

1322
01:39:59,990 --> 01:40:03,251
[SPEAKER_02]: As a result, we no longer allow women to attend the event.

1323
01:40:04,671 --> 01:40:08,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, thoughts so far before I read the update.

1324
01:40:08,412 --> 01:40:09,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be fair.

1325
01:40:09,493 --> 01:40:13,834
[SPEAKER_02]: This paragraph has since been changed, but let's hear DarkSakura's initial reaction to this.

1326
01:40:13,854 --> 01:40:23,896
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're a private organization and then they do have the right as a private organization, however,

1327
01:40:26,178 --> 01:40:27,579
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the right to call them dickheads.

1328
01:40:46,343 --> 01:40:48,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Outside of the box.

1329
01:40:49,346 --> 01:40:51,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go for, well, this will be this way.

1330
01:40:51,327 --> 01:40:52,608
[SPEAKER_07]: We just won't have chicks there, huh?

1331
01:40:52,768 --> 01:40:56,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for this whole weekend, they will all be thinking outside of the box.

1332
01:40:56,311 --> 01:40:59,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there will be no boxes at this event, if you know what I mean.

1333
01:41:00,835 --> 01:41:07,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is why, sorry, but this is why male geeks get a bad rep.

1334
01:41:09,102 --> 01:41:10,423
[SPEAKER_07]: You are afraid of us.

1335
01:41:11,444 --> 01:41:15,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, when we kick your ass, you have to resort to name-calling.

1336
01:41:17,122 --> 01:41:31,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you do when some noob kicks your ass It's just immaturity is all it is They just name call everybody And it's the women that get upset about it Maybe if women would cry less they'd get invited to these events

1337
01:41:32,162 --> 01:41:32,983
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1338
01:41:54,321 --> 01:41:55,162
[SPEAKER_02]: You kill me?

1339
01:41:55,282 --> 01:41:56,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop being such a fag.

1340
01:41:56,962 --> 01:41:58,243
[SPEAKER_02]: You're being a fag.

1341
01:41:58,283 --> 01:41:59,944
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a little fag right now.

1342
01:41:59,964 --> 01:42:07,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guarantee you, in a room like that, there's going to be at least one who passed the penis check.

1343
01:42:08,408 --> 01:42:17,152
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing, too, if you've got to complain about people killing you in a death match where the point is to kill each other, I don't understand.

1344
01:42:17,372 --> 01:42:18,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you killing me?

1345
01:42:18,713 --> 01:42:19,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you killing me?

1346
01:42:19,673 --> 01:42:21,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's the point of the game!

1347
01:42:21,434 --> 01:42:22,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm calling for infiltration.

1348
01:42:23,949 --> 01:42:25,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Infiltration?

1349
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:26,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Women run in?

1350
01:42:26,990 --> 01:42:27,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Stampede?

1351
01:42:28,031 --> 01:42:28,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Burn your bras?

1352
01:42:29,231 --> 01:42:29,511
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1353
01:42:30,972 --> 01:42:32,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm calling for chick drag.

1354
01:42:33,273 --> 01:42:34,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Chick drag?

1355
01:42:34,854 --> 01:42:35,614
[SPEAKER_07]: You know it exists?

1356
01:42:35,794 --> 01:42:36,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, oh god.

1357
01:42:37,075 --> 01:42:40,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at the bar one night with friends with a birthday celebration.

1358
01:42:40,516 --> 01:42:43,397
[SPEAKER_02]: We got there a little early and we walked right in on a drag king show.

1359
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:44,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I kid you not.

1360
01:42:45,218 --> 01:42:48,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted some drag kings and some nice butch lesbians to go in.

1361
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very butch.

1362
01:42:52,061 --> 01:42:56,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Drag Queens are very sassy.

1363
01:42:56,803 --> 01:43:04,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Drag Queens are taking the ultimate of the feminine mystique and playing it all of it up.

1364
01:43:04,727 --> 01:43:06,408
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the same thing for Drag Queens.

1365
01:43:06,568 --> 01:43:10,210
[SPEAKER_07]: They take the boring dudeness and make it more boring and doodly.

1366
01:43:11,315 --> 01:43:36,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the chatroom at chat.orange.com Tons of comments in chat here Actdeft says they should ban the immature people instead of women Breakman says nothing ruins a good sausage fest like a woman Laha says this is why we can't have nice things Frisbee says this isn't the south, this is Texas

1367
01:43:38,786 --> 01:43:41,549
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, look, to be fair, there was an update.

1368
01:43:41,629 --> 01:43:43,271
[SPEAKER_02]: They did remove that paragraph.

1369
01:43:43,311 --> 01:43:44,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's what happened.

1370
01:43:44,793 --> 01:43:48,357
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying this event is a gentleman's retreat.

1371
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:58,021
[SPEAKER_02]: We actively discourage gamers from being the kind of misogynistic jack wagon seen in the Reddit post, and such behavior should not be tolerated.

1372
01:43:58,641 --> 01:44:00,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Frankly, we don't like that kind of player either.

1373
01:44:01,183 --> 01:44:05,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So far as this event goes, it's a special event designed specifically for male gamers.

1374
01:44:06,546 --> 01:44:14,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Further, it is meant as a getaway designed to help said male contingent become better men, both for themselves and for those who love us.

1375
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's more bullshit.

1376
01:44:19,662 --> 01:44:20,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta tell ya.

1377
01:44:20,942 --> 01:44:21,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta tell ya.

1378
01:44:22,403 --> 01:44:23,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been to Texas.

1379
01:44:23,344 --> 01:44:25,245
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was in Texas once for like five minutes.

1380
01:44:25,265 --> 01:44:30,607
[SPEAKER_07]: For the few smart people in Texas, like Travis, you're not on the stupid list.

1381
01:44:30,947 --> 01:44:31,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1382
01:44:31,428 --> 01:44:33,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Most everybody else is on the stupid list.

1383
01:44:33,229 --> 01:44:35,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I know plenty of smart people in Texas.

1384
01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:37,371
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some that listen to this show, actually.

1385
01:44:38,411 --> 01:44:45,415
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Jeff Foxworthy says, when it comes time to talk about the South, the news always points out the least common denominator.

1386
01:44:46,355 --> 01:44:46,755
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?

1387
01:44:47,675 --> 01:44:48,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

1388
01:44:48,456 --> 01:44:53,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to admit, there's a part of me that's a little bit tempted since it is an all-male retreat.

1389
01:44:54,878 --> 01:44:56,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only 49 bucks.

1390
01:44:56,618 --> 01:44:59,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should go and maybe I should flame it up a little bit.

1391
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:02,900
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1392
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard there was a retreat!

1393
01:45:09,043 --> 01:45:12,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, we're gonna play some Battlefield?

1394
01:45:14,306 --> 01:45:15,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Battlefield!

1395
01:45:18,749 --> 01:45:21,731
[SPEAKER_02]: He just shot you in the head, what a stupid bitch.

1396
01:45:25,373 --> 01:45:34,058
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a small part of me that wants to, even though I would play up to every negative stereotype I'm sure these guys already have, like, I just, you know there's that part of me that just

1397
01:45:35,715 --> 01:45:37,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, here's my idea.

1398
01:45:39,379 --> 01:45:46,285
[SPEAKER_07]: One, you either have the infiltration go on, have a woman beat all the guys' asses, and go, oh, by the way, here's my boobs.

1399
01:45:47,346 --> 01:45:50,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, the ladies have their own counter-retreat.

1400
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:54,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Say, fine, you're not inviting us, bitches, you're not allowed.

1401
01:45:57,995 --> 01:46:00,176
[SPEAKER_02]: and some interesting comments from chat here.

1402
01:46:00,536 --> 01:46:03,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Wolf says, are they also telling black people to stay home?

1403
01:46:03,937 --> 01:46:05,818
[SPEAKER_02]: No, race is not a part of this.

1404
01:46:05,938 --> 01:46:08,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're just sexist, not racist.

1405
01:46:08,439 --> 01:46:09,459
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just sexist.

1406
01:46:10,039 --> 01:46:14,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just guess with nothing to back me up, also homophobic.

1407
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:18,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe a little bit racist, but I don't know.

1408
01:46:18,502 --> 01:46:20,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, we're not seeing any apparent racism going on here.

1409
01:46:21,584 --> 01:46:28,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Salacious Pop says, Loki, I feel that women who opt into participating in that first person shooter culture know what they're getting into to a point.

1410
01:46:29,008 --> 01:46:36,873
[SPEAKER_02]: But neckbeards realize this and decide to escalate it until it becomes pretty disgusting and unacceptable no matter what kind of game it is and a line just gets crossed.

1411
01:46:37,213 --> 01:46:40,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should be able to shit talk without going the gender race gay route.

1412
01:46:40,595 --> 01:46:42,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It just means you're not very articulate.

1413
01:46:43,729 --> 01:46:44,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Aha!

1414
01:46:44,429 --> 01:46:47,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Become a smarter cut lower person.

1415
01:46:47,892 --> 01:46:48,292
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1416
01:46:49,012 --> 01:46:52,534
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to be smarter about your cut downs.

1417
01:46:53,775 --> 01:47:06,903
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but I mean, and I'm... And this is why I say this, and people, smart people in the South will know what I'm talking about, is that that's just, it just is like typical.

1418
01:47:07,703 --> 01:47:08,844
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just typical.

1419
01:47:08,864 --> 01:47:09,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Typical.

1420
01:47:10,134 --> 01:47:16,598
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says, Devil's Advocate, there are plenty of female-only LAN events and that's empowering girl gamers.

1421
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:23,583
[SPEAKER_02]: True, but the backpedaling here a little bit is what makes it notable.

1422
01:47:23,643 --> 01:47:25,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have the frag dolls.

1423
01:47:25,304 --> 01:47:27,066
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an all-female team.

1424
01:47:29,147 --> 01:47:31,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't allow men in the frag dolls at all?

1425
01:47:31,469 --> 01:47:33,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I tried to be a frag doll, I couldn't do it?

1426
01:47:34,827 --> 01:47:36,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you go ahead and play your first person shooters.

1427
01:47:37,229 --> 01:47:41,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Step into Grand Theft Auto, I'm going to own your ass.

1428
01:47:42,113 --> 01:47:49,579
[SPEAKER_07]: But the whole point is just that it's really... And Breakman is asking us to stop hating on the neckbeards, please.

1429
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:54,343
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a neckbeard and he's feeling a little offended right now so that we need to stop being neckbeard-a-phobic.

1430
01:47:55,865 --> 01:47:56,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, ZZ Top.

1431
01:47:58,527 --> 01:47:58,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1432
01:47:59,748 --> 01:48:00,508
[SPEAKER_07]: But my point is...

1433
01:48:02,346 --> 01:48:06,368
[SPEAKER_07]: This is shit that I've run into all the time when I lived in Alabama.

1434
01:48:10,649 --> 01:48:14,151
[SPEAKER_07]: My geek knowledge far exceeded any of the guys.

1435
01:48:14,951 --> 01:48:18,112
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, oh, we're doing a guy party, sorry.

1436
01:48:19,253 --> 01:48:19,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you!

1437
01:48:21,394 --> 01:48:24,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kicked your ass at this game yesterday, is that why I'm not going?

1438
01:48:25,415 --> 01:48:25,936
[SPEAKER_02]: No comment.

1439
01:48:26,476 --> 01:48:26,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1440
01:48:27,486 --> 01:48:28,788
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

[SPEAKER_02]: What did you guest on this week?

1443
01:49:14,759 --> 01:49:19,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as I said last week, I'm on two episodes of Pop Culture Parlay.

1444
01:49:20,162 --> 01:49:21,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, you did an episode arc.

1445
01:49:21,543 --> 01:49:21,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1446
01:49:22,043 --> 01:49:26,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Which you can go to geek-life.com and download or go on iTunes.

[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1448
01:49:28,765 --> 01:49:29,045
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1449
01:49:29,085 --> 01:49:29,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that out.

1450
01:49:29,505 --> 01:49:30,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop Culture Parlay.

1451
01:49:30,245 --> 01:49:34,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I did listen to a little bit of that first episode you were on while I was driving to the store or something.

1452
01:49:34,547 --> 01:49:36,368
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was recently on Girls Gone Well.

1453
01:49:37,148 --> 01:49:38,569
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can look back for that episode too.

1454
01:49:39,349 --> 01:49:42,451
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mystery Third Podcast I'm hoping will be a reality very soon.

1455
01:49:42,511 --> 01:49:48,953
[SPEAKER_02]: We've just had some we're too busy setbacks going on and knowing my week next week that's not going to get any better.

1456
01:49:49,074 --> 01:49:50,034
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens.

1457
01:49:50,174 --> 01:49:51,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm busy Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

1458
01:49:51,435 --> 01:49:51,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So

1459
01:49:52,515 --> 01:49:53,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Busy, Busy Bee.

1460
01:49:53,515 --> 01:49:54,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Busy, Busy Bee.

1461
01:49:54,736 --> 01:49:56,556
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully we'll get that together.

1462
01:49:56,616 --> 01:49:58,017
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a third podcast coming.

1463
01:49:58,897 --> 01:50:01,238
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be like a huge thing.

1464
01:50:01,398 --> 01:50:03,839
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be like 30 minutes tops a week.

1465
01:50:04,059 --> 01:50:05,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Breakman suggests you go as Captain Sassy Pants.

1466
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:07,600
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1467
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,361
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's to look forward to.

1468
01:50:11,542 --> 01:50:15,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, speaking of like guesting on shows and stuff, I just want to kind of throw that out there.

1469
01:50:15,803 --> 01:50:22,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, if you have a podcast or your own show, I've heard some people say like, oh, well, I would ask you to be on the show.

1470
01:50:23,007 --> 01:50:27,689
[SPEAKER_02]: But my show is just this little show that's nothing serious.

1471
01:50:27,789 --> 01:50:30,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I never wanted to ask you guys because I'm too shy.

1472
01:50:30,610 --> 01:50:33,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, if I have the time, I will gladly come on any show.

1473
01:50:34,092 --> 01:50:35,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, as long as your show isn't, you know...

1474
01:50:36,653 --> 01:50:38,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to guest on any show.

1475
01:50:38,635 --> 01:50:41,779
[SPEAKER_02]: The size of this show is not that large, so don't feel like you can't ever approach us.

1476
01:50:56,039 --> 01:50:57,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, size isn't what matters.

1477
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:58,000
[SPEAKER_07]: It's girth.

1478
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:02,362
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can email us either at mailbag at orangeauntradio.com or you can even email me directly.

1479
01:51:02,742 --> 01:51:04,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went right past what you said.

1480
01:51:05,043 --> 01:51:06,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob at orangeauntradio.com.

1481
01:51:06,323 --> 01:51:08,084
[SPEAKER_02]: You got rid of yours because too much spam, right?

1482
01:51:08,824 --> 01:51:09,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one?

1483
01:51:09,425 --> 01:51:10,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1484
01:51:10,045 --> 01:51:10,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Orangeauntradio account.

1485
01:51:10,685 --> 01:51:11,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I got way too much.

1486
01:51:11,345 --> 01:51:13,146
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's ways to find her.

1487
01:51:13,346 --> 01:51:15,707
[SPEAKER_07]: If you message the mailbag, I'll see it.

1488
01:51:15,807 --> 01:51:17,868
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not like... And we would be happy.

1489
01:51:17,888 --> 01:51:19,469
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as we can fit it into the schedule somewhere.

1490
01:51:19,509 --> 01:51:22,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind we're on the West Coast and for a lot of... And I'm on Twitter, darksakra.com.

1491
01:51:23,018 --> 01:51:24,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, Twitter's a great way to get a hold of us too.

1492
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:25,780
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I still got a hold of me.

1493
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:26,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

1494
01:51:27,421 --> 01:51:27,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

1495
01:51:28,101 --> 01:51:29,162
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always happy to come.

1496
01:51:30,103 --> 01:51:34,006
[SPEAKER_02]: We're approaching our 10th year of podcasting and we want it to be a big fucking deal.

1497
01:51:34,446 --> 01:51:38,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So especially come next year, we're going to try and go on as many shows as we can.

1498
01:51:38,128 --> 01:51:39,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're always happy to do that.

1499
01:51:40,370 --> 01:51:41,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, that's all I wanted to say.

1500
01:51:41,190 --> 01:51:45,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us more stuff to plug at the top of Part B until our third podcast launches.

1501
01:51:45,794 --> 01:51:48,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news.

1502
01:51:49,456 --> 01:51:51,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Some news that we just didn't have time to cover elsewhere.

1503
01:51:51,898 --> 01:51:52,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1504
01:51:53,068 --> 01:51:59,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of course there's some more details now out about the 360 port of Minecraft.

1505
01:52:00,055 --> 01:52:03,818
[SPEAKER_04]: This is coming from Notch, of course the guy behind Minecraft.

1506
01:52:04,559 --> 01:52:09,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And saying there's actually going to be marketing for the Xbox 360 version of Minecraft.

1507
01:52:09,123 --> 01:52:14,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've agreed to be slightly less transparent than usual when it comes to that version.

1508
01:52:15,168 --> 01:52:17,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically saying that there's going to be some...

1509
01:52:18,411 --> 01:52:18,631
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

1510
01:52:38,516 --> 01:52:40,958
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm going to do at the Gentleman's Retreat for Battlefield, by the way.

1511
01:52:41,218 --> 01:52:42,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't shoot me!

1512
01:52:44,241 --> 01:52:45,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that.

1513
01:52:47,243 --> 01:52:56,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, he also said that there's, of course, the Xperia Play version of Minecraft that's going to be coming out for $7 sometime this fall.

1514
01:52:57,111 --> 01:53:03,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess it's programmed in a way that will make it easy to port to all sorts of mobile phones.

1515
01:53:04,957 --> 01:53:05,898
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of neat.

1516
01:53:06,959 --> 01:53:10,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we'll hear more details as we get closer to its release.

1517
01:53:10,424 --> 01:53:11,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it'll be pretty big.

1518
01:53:13,708 --> 01:53:21,899
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just love Valve and you really want to get your hands on some Valve action figures and other stuff, well, you're going to wait until 2012.

1519
01:53:22,019 --> 01:53:23,662
[SPEAKER_04]: But, toy company NECA...

1520
01:53:24,102 --> 01:53:29,266
[SPEAKER_04]: They have revealed their lineup at Comic-Con, including a bunch of different franchises.

1521
01:53:29,326 --> 01:53:32,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting with Half-Life 2, you can be able to get a Gordon Freeman action figure.

1522
01:53:33,308 --> 01:53:36,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Team Fortress 2, you can get a Pyro, Heavy, and Demo action figure.

1523
01:53:37,511 --> 01:53:41,093
[SPEAKER_04]: And also they have Left 4 Dead, the Boomer and Smoker action figures.

1524
01:53:41,654 --> 01:53:53,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, for Portal 2, Atlas and Peabody action figures, as well as a replica Portal gun and a resin and plush weighted companion cube.

1525
01:53:55,264 --> 01:53:57,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal Gun, that's going to be pretty awesome.

1526
01:53:59,128 --> 01:54:09,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you though, NECA, if you really want to impress me, you'll do full-size turret bots.

1527
01:54:09,439 --> 01:54:10,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they sing?

1528
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:11,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if that's the case, I kind of want one.

1529
01:54:13,630 --> 01:54:14,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still there?

1530
01:54:14,992 --> 01:54:15,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you still there?

1531
01:54:30,951 --> 01:54:31,231
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1532
01:54:31,551 --> 01:54:32,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait for you to bring that to the show.

1533
01:54:32,732 --> 01:54:33,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to bring that to episode 500?

1534
01:54:33,813 --> 01:54:35,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

1535
01:54:35,614 --> 01:54:35,834
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1536
01:54:36,535 --> 01:54:40,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, Grasshopper Manufacturing is putting out a new game.

1537
01:54:41,198 --> 01:54:47,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It was featured in Famitsu Magazine, and it is straight up Grasshopper.

1538
01:54:49,443 --> 01:54:51,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Lollipop Chainsaw is the new game.

1539
01:54:51,524 --> 01:54:53,344
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and 360.

1540
01:54:53,705 --> 01:55:02,389
[SPEAKER_04]: It is basically a game about a cheerleader raised by zombie hunters who uses her acrobatic training and chainsaw to destroy zombies.

1541
01:55:03,209 --> 01:55:05,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that a side plot in Jurassic Park 2?

1542
01:55:06,631 --> 01:55:09,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Where that acrobat little girl kicked the dinosaur in the face?

1543
01:55:09,793 --> 01:55:11,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they said that was retarded.

1544
01:55:11,533 --> 01:55:12,454
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks awesome.

1545
01:55:12,494 --> 01:55:13,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey.

1546
01:55:13,394 --> 01:55:14,855
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you're not going to use that word anymore.

1547
01:55:14,875 --> 01:55:15,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, whatever.

1548
01:55:16,016 --> 01:55:16,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1549
01:55:17,657 --> 01:55:45,796
[SPEAKER_04]: so this should be pretty awesome and they have some screenshots up for it and she's got a chainsaw with hearts on it and she's killing zombies so it sounds to me almost a little bit like Oni Chambara just hopefully plays a lot better and of course Akira Yamaoka working on the sound nice so all good that would have made the Jurassic Park 2 a lot better if Akira Yamaoka had done the soundtrack

1550
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:49,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear there's, by the way, a confirmed Jurassic Park 4 is in development?

1551
01:55:50,163 --> 01:55:51,024
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to bring that back.

1552
01:55:51,685 --> 01:55:53,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved those movies when I was a kid, at least the first one.

1553
01:55:53,887 --> 01:56:00,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the plot of them, you know, somehow making it to mainland and kind of spreading would be pretty awesome.

1554
01:56:00,294 --> 01:56:03,137
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because that's what happened at the end of the second movie and it was terrible.

1555
01:56:03,157 --> 01:56:04,419
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what made that movie so bad.

1556
01:56:04,699 --> 01:56:07,705
[SPEAKER_04]: No, what made it bad is just they have a feature of the T-Rex.

1557
01:56:07,725 --> 01:56:14,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about like, you know, where it's years later where they're multiplying and coming out in small towns and stuff.

1558
01:56:14,818 --> 01:56:16,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Planet of the Dinosaurs.

1559
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:16,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, track them down.

1560
01:56:18,025 --> 01:56:20,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Team Fortress Arcade Team Fortress Arcade Team Fortress Arcade

1561
01:56:43,286 --> 01:56:47,607
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the Demoman can blast out sticky bombs and explode whenever he does the jumping.

1562
01:56:48,027 --> 01:56:51,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Engineerings can do upgrades with the wrench and so forth.

1563
01:56:51,968 --> 01:56:55,809
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually some hands-on sessions that have been reviewed on around the internet.

1564
01:56:55,829 --> 01:56:59,370
[SPEAKER_02]: There's even a little YouTube there that I guess some site did.

1565
01:56:59,390 --> 01:57:00,590
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a little review.

1566
01:57:01,570 --> 01:57:03,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's probably talking over this, but let me see if you get...

1567
01:57:04,711 --> 01:57:05,331
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura

1568
01:57:23,238 --> 01:57:27,181
[SPEAKER_02]: and also announced to Comic Con this week an R2-D2 Xbox 360.

1569
01:57:27,262 --> 01:57:37,530
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, it's an Xbox 360 bundle coming with a white Kinect and a white Xbox 360 that is kind of skinned, so to speak, to look like a R2-D2.

1570
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:41,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of got that blue and the little vents and so forth.

1571
01:57:41,533 --> 01:57:42,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was kind of neat.

1572
01:57:42,814 --> 01:57:46,437
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really cute and of course it comes with Kinect Star Wars and it's a 320 gigabyte edition.

1573
01:57:46,457 --> 01:57:46,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a $449 bundle.

1574
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:57,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of which, Connect Star Wars and stuff, we're doing our company game something where we have publishers out and they sometimes bring demos and stuff.

1575
01:57:58,087 --> 01:58:01,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll actually get the demo Connect Star Wars Tuesday.

1576
01:58:02,150 --> 01:58:02,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.

1577
01:58:02,810 --> 01:58:07,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, tell us what you think about that because it looks really bad, but it could be fun.

1578
01:58:07,334 --> 01:58:07,554
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1579
01:58:07,574 --> 01:58:10,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really hope THQ brings Saints Row 3 with them.

1580
01:58:11,558 --> 01:58:12,238
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1581
01:58:12,959 --> 01:58:13,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want them.

1582
01:58:13,779 --> 01:58:15,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I am upset with Actdeft right now.

1583
01:58:15,661 --> 01:58:15,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1584
01:58:16,141 --> 01:58:18,083
[SPEAKER_07]: For mentioning Horchata and I really want some now.

1585
01:58:18,911 --> 01:58:20,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Orchatas are delicious.

1586
01:58:20,212 --> 01:58:20,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1587
01:58:21,313 --> 01:58:23,635
[SPEAKER_02]: They have places open 24 hours that sell Orchatas.

1588
01:58:23,995 --> 01:58:25,656
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can't get Pinkberry, let's get Orchatas.

1589
01:58:25,676 --> 01:58:26,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go get Orchata and a taco?

1590
01:58:27,257 --> 01:58:27,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1591
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:29,359
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1592
01:58:29,759 --> 01:58:30,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1593
01:58:30,239 --> 01:58:31,340
[SPEAKER_02]: This show's running late tonight.

1594
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:31,801
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we'll see.

1595
01:58:32,181 --> 01:58:39,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, this news is not quite as awesome as the Orchata, but it's very, what is this going on here?

1596
01:58:39,947 --> 01:58:42,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, remember Mortal Kombat and the download character's Mortal Kombat.

1597
01:58:42,809 --> 01:58:47,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And we knew for quite some time that there was going to be the Kenshi...

1598
01:58:47,452 --> 01:58:49,253
[SPEAKER_02]: There was going to be Scarlet and Rain.

1599
01:58:49,553 --> 01:58:56,337
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew those three characters for quite some time, but Warner Brothers really kept the fourth character under wraps for a long time.

1600
01:58:56,677 --> 01:58:58,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the fourth character was revealed this week.

1601
01:58:58,518 --> 01:59:04,241
[SPEAKER_02]: The fourth download character for Mortal Kombat is going to be not Tanya, not Meat.

1602
01:59:04,841 --> 01:59:06,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be Freddy Krueger.

1603
01:59:08,584 --> 01:59:12,086
[SPEAKER_02]: To which a lot of people kind of went, kind of want?

1604
01:59:12,986 --> 01:59:14,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think that was the reaction of most of my friends.

1605
01:59:14,607 --> 01:59:16,048
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, okay.

1606
01:59:16,928 --> 01:59:17,468
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of cool.

1607
01:59:17,508 --> 01:59:19,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I can do this.

1608
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:20,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the fatalities.

1609
01:59:21,050 --> 01:59:21,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1610
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:23,871
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, the fatalities in the video were pretty awesome.

1611
01:59:23,911 --> 01:59:25,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, throwing one into the incinerator or whatever.

1612
01:59:25,832 --> 01:59:28,274
[SPEAKER_07]: In the furnace, because, you know, you had the boiler room.

1613
01:59:28,674 --> 01:59:31,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first one that they showed with him pulling him down and the blood coming up.

1614
01:59:31,995 --> 01:59:34,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was very... That was a nod back to the first movie.

1615
01:59:34,116 --> 01:59:35,457
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a scene right out of the first movie, yeah.

1616
01:59:35,477 --> 01:59:36,017
[SPEAKER_07]: With Johnny Depp.

1617
01:59:36,137 --> 01:59:36,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

1618
01:59:36,718 --> 01:59:36,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

1619
01:59:37,538 --> 01:59:38,739
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1620
02:00:08,482 --> 02:00:22,178
[SPEAKER_07]: In other news... Well, a character that is confirmed for Arkham City is Talia al Ghul, the daughter of Ra's al Ghul, who is sometimes an anti-heroine and sometimes bad and sometimes good.

1621
02:00:23,159 --> 02:00:28,505
[SPEAKER_07]: But she is going to be voiced by Stanna Kadic, who is in Castle.

1622
02:00:29,466 --> 02:00:42,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So other characters that are going to be in there now is the Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Robin, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Penguin, Two-Face, Hugo Strange, Victor, Zaz, Calendar Man, and Black Mask.

1623
02:00:44,404 --> 02:00:48,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And moving forward, Dance Central is getting some new songs.

1624
02:00:49,405 --> 02:00:56,507
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually getting one from Afrika Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force, Planet Rock, which is one of my favorite songs.

1625
02:00:57,627 --> 02:01:02,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Tayo Cruz, Break Your Heart, and Trey Songz featuring Fabulous.

1626
02:01:03,128 --> 02:01:05,009
[SPEAKER_07]: It says Fabulous.

1627
02:01:06,309 --> 02:01:06,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Learn to spell.

1628
02:01:07,429 --> 02:01:09,390
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, I'm excited about the first one.

1629
02:01:09,810 --> 02:01:14,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, last but never least, Child of Eden gets a PS3 date.

1630
02:01:15,714 --> 02:01:19,616
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be on September 20th in the US and September 23rd in Europe.

1631
02:01:20,437 --> 02:01:24,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And the European price is going to be about half as much for the PS3 version.

1632
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:26,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hey.

1633
02:01:28,602 --> 02:01:28,922
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1634
02:01:30,541 --> 02:01:30,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1635
02:01:31,641 --> 02:01:37,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I guess we should go to the Twitter, although I forgot to plug that at the top of the show, so I don't know if we actually got a lot of tweets tonight.

1636
02:01:38,283 --> 02:01:41,444
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's okay, because we're running long tonight anyway, so I guess something's got to give at some point.

1637
02:01:41,464 --> 02:01:42,504
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on in the Twatter?

1638
02:01:43,064 --> 02:01:44,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go look at the Twatter right now.

1639
02:01:44,565 --> 02:01:51,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I get to Twitter, though, can I say, there was another game I've been playing this week that I forgot to mention, and I just caught myself looking at it.

1640
02:01:52,367 --> 02:01:56,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I have to say, on the iPhone, there's this game called Tiny Tower.

1641
02:01:57,808 --> 02:01:59,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are playing this.

1642
02:02:00,169 --> 02:02:00,590
[SPEAKER_02]: BitBook

1643
02:02:24,711 --> 02:02:39,544
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can look at what the citizens of your tower are posting on their bitbooks and let's see like for instance I forgot to restock the plant nursery for like a couple hours because I'm doing this show so one of my people wrote on bitbook came to work at the plant nursery but no one is here

1644
02:02:40,754 --> 02:02:41,595
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just things like that.

1645
02:02:41,615 --> 02:02:48,101
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other day, one of them wrote something like, we're going to have a party to celebrate so-and-so moving in, silly hats only.

1646
02:02:48,181 --> 02:02:51,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really cracked me up because it was a reference to the cartoon Rejected.

1647
02:02:52,265 --> 02:02:52,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1648
02:02:52,946 --> 02:02:54,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, yeah, that's a free game.

1649
02:02:54,347 --> 02:02:59,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing the shit out of that because, you know, the tower bucks are what costs money, but you don't need them to play the game.

1650
02:03:00,012 --> 02:03:01,634
[SPEAKER_02]: So that whole thing going on.

1651
02:03:02,094 --> 02:03:02,355
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1652
02:03:03,376 --> 02:03:05,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, back to the Twitter.

1653
02:03:06,556 --> 02:03:07,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1654
02:03:07,237 --> 02:03:08,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the tweets.

1655
02:03:09,499 --> 02:03:10,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting into some twats here.

1656
02:03:11,081 --> 02:03:11,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1657
02:03:12,963 --> 02:03:16,868
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S tweeted something that's going to come up in a little bit here on the show, I think.

1658
02:03:16,948 --> 02:03:18,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's coming up a little later, so I can't read his tweet.

1659
02:03:19,571 --> 02:03:20,932
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me go to Spazinator.

1660
02:03:21,493 --> 02:03:24,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the ball rolling on getting my PS3 fixed yesterday.

1661
02:03:24,156 --> 02:03:25,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Just waiting on the coffin now.

1662
02:03:26,278 --> 02:03:27,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-gaming news.

1663
02:03:27,539 --> 02:03:30,220
[SPEAKER_02]: As of today, gay marriage is now legal in New York State.

1664
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:32,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's terrific.

1665
02:03:32,521 --> 02:03:33,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish our state would catch up.

1666
02:03:33,922 --> 02:03:38,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it's not going to send like a gay wave across the nation.

1667
02:03:38,745 --> 02:03:45,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, gay people are going to be in happy, committed stuff whether you choose to acknowledge it legally or not.

1668
02:03:45,908 --> 02:03:48,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you don't acknowledge it legally, that's called discrimination.

1669
02:03:49,090 --> 02:03:50,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it's as simple as that.

1670
02:03:50,611 --> 02:03:53,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what are you going to accomplish banning gay marriage?

1671
02:03:54,073 --> 02:03:54,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

1672
02:03:56,673 --> 02:04:05,037
[SPEAKER_02]: But by doing it, you are... I could get into that whole rant, but it's just like... I think Dee Snider said it best in a tweet this week.

1673
02:04:05,077 --> 02:04:08,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm referring to Dee Snider from... What was it?

1674
02:04:08,078 --> 02:04:08,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Twisted Sister?

1675
02:04:08,759 --> 02:04:09,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Twisted Sister.

1676
02:04:09,799 --> 02:04:10,880
[SPEAKER_02]: He said something like, it's 2011.

1677
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:14,722
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't finally support gay marriage, then you're the problem.

1678
02:04:15,722 --> 02:04:15,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Agreed.

1679
02:04:16,823 --> 02:04:18,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, that's how I feel.

1680
02:04:18,964 --> 02:04:20,024
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't agree with me, deal with it.

1681
02:04:21,545 --> 02:04:21,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1682
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:25,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if this is coming up later or not.

1683
02:04:25,182 --> 02:04:27,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can talk about this one.

1684
02:04:27,423 --> 02:04:29,545
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm repeating a story coming up, I apologize.

1685
02:04:29,985 --> 02:04:32,467
[SPEAKER_02]: SJ100Matt tweeted us with a story about Bobby Kotick.

1686
02:04:33,248 --> 02:04:36,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Kotick opened his mouth again to spew more trash this week.

1687
02:04:36,370 --> 02:04:39,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he says DJ Hero was a huge mistake.

1688
02:04:41,052 --> 02:04:43,153
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in an interview with Forbes Magazine.

1689
02:04:44,054 --> 02:04:46,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Kotek says DJ Hero was a passion project.

1690
02:04:47,837 --> 02:04:51,799
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have said, well how many people really want to unleash their inner DJ?

1691
02:04:52,260 --> 02:05:02,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And then out of the people who do want to unleash their inner DJ, how many want to do it in the context of a game where you earn points versus just taking a DJ deck or tools on their Mac and actually being a DJ?

1692
02:05:02,827 --> 02:05:04,829
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out it's a very small market.

1693
02:05:06,029 --> 02:05:13,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bobby Kotick said that seeing DJ Hero fail despite critical acclaim in the marketing plan that pushed it down their throats was one of the hardest failures for him.

1694
02:05:15,111 --> 02:05:15,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

1695
02:05:15,911 --> 02:05:18,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also talks about Guitar Hero and so on.

1696
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:26,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, it was very clear people didn't want more 80s heavy metal music, but what they wanted was very difficult for us to get from the music companies.

1697
02:05:27,394 --> 02:05:30,657
[SPEAKER_02]: The number one thing that our audiences wanted in Guitar Hero was Led Zeppelin.

1698
02:05:30,897 --> 02:05:33,499
[SPEAKER_02]: But we couldn't get Led Zeppelin to consent to give us the rights.

1699
02:05:34,339 --> 02:05:34,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1700
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:38,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of blaming the failure of Guitar Hero on the music industry.

1701
02:05:38,763 --> 02:05:41,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe there's only so many songs that people want to play.

1702
02:05:42,105 --> 02:05:43,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when you look at rock band.

1703
02:05:44,106 --> 02:05:45,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, rock band has almost everything now.

1704
02:05:46,548 --> 02:05:47,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems like.

1705
02:05:47,269 --> 02:05:48,309
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm always wanting more.

1706
02:05:48,670 --> 02:05:48,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1707
02:05:50,051 --> 02:05:50,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1708
02:05:51,472 --> 02:05:51,752
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1709
02:05:53,709 --> 02:05:54,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to other tweets.

1710
02:05:55,391 --> 02:06:02,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Zether77 tweets us saying, According to a YouTube video, OpaOpa is a hidden character in Planet Harriers.

1711
02:06:03,042 --> 02:06:05,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but OpaOpa also makes appearances in levels.

1712
02:06:06,387 --> 02:06:06,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, I see.

1713
02:06:07,572 --> 02:06:10,534
[SPEAKER_02]: and somebody else I'm guessing is on his friends list.

1714
02:06:11,215 --> 02:06:11,615
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this?

1715
02:06:11,755 --> 02:06:17,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Kijikage responded to him and said, I've been wanting that for years, like since GameCube came out.

1716
02:06:17,859 --> 02:06:20,000
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not alone in your Planet Harrier love.

1717
02:06:20,421 --> 02:06:23,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Planet Harriers is like... It did look pretty awesome.

1718
02:06:23,863 --> 02:06:25,524
[SPEAKER_02]: It did look pretty awesome from the video you showed me.

1719
02:06:25,544 --> 02:06:26,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wish I'd played that.

1720
02:06:26,865 --> 02:06:29,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea that it was at Great America.

1721
02:06:29,547 --> 02:06:30,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I just somehow overlooked that.

1722
02:06:31,609 --> 02:06:33,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, TigerClaw sends us a couple tweets.

1723
02:06:33,673 --> 02:06:35,196
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them's about Majora's Mask.

1724
02:06:35,717 --> 02:06:37,019
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, on the 3DS.

1725
02:06:37,179 --> 02:06:37,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

1726
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:40,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, we had Zelda Ocarina of Time on the 3DS.

1727
02:06:40,987 --> 02:06:43,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not Majora's Mask?

1728
02:06:44,142 --> 02:06:44,302
[SPEAKER_02]: E.G.

1729
02:06:44,523 --> 02:06:46,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Anoma, who is one of the folks behind Zelda

1730
02:07:04,338 --> 02:07:07,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they're saying that if fans demanded it, they would make it.

1731
02:07:08,401 --> 02:07:13,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so that you'll do, but oh, the people wanting you to port a simple game that's already been localized.

1732
02:07:14,727 --> 02:07:16,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, you'll take a shit on them.

1733
02:07:17,370 --> 02:07:17,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1734
02:07:18,951 --> 02:07:23,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, I don't know, I still think, Loki, there's going to be a press conference where it says the fans demanded it.

1735
02:07:23,936 --> 02:07:27,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course they're going to, and they're going to come out looking like the heroes.

1736
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:28,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at those abs, dude.

1737
02:07:30,703 --> 02:07:31,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, on Poison?

1738
02:07:31,283 --> 02:07:31,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Poison.

1739
02:07:32,184 --> 02:07:32,424
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1740
02:07:32,744 --> 02:07:36,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, last tweet here from Tigerclaw about Wesley Snipes.

1741
02:07:36,946 --> 02:07:38,827
[SPEAKER_02]: He has made a video game from prison.

1742
02:07:39,587 --> 02:07:40,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely right.

1743
02:07:40,928 --> 02:07:43,489
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Julius Stiles the International.

1744
02:07:43,569 --> 02:07:47,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a video game that Wesley Snipes... Not to be confused with Julius Stiles.

1745
02:07:47,351 --> 02:07:47,771
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1746
02:07:48,172 --> 02:07:52,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Wesley Snipes, by the way, most famous for his role in Too Wong Fu, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar.

1747
02:07:52,834 --> 02:07:53,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Does not look good in drag.

1748
02:07:55,115 --> 02:07:57,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1749
02:08:16,407 --> 02:08:22,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the game is only coming out on iPad and iPhone because those are probably the easiest platforms to publish on.

1750
02:08:22,589 --> 02:08:23,589
[SPEAKER_07]: And we like criminals.

1751
02:08:24,049 --> 02:08:25,229
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, Julia Stiles.

1752
02:08:25,269 --> 02:08:29,330
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to support Wesley Snipes and help fund his legal fund, you can check out this game.

1753
02:08:31,911 --> 02:08:34,852
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for the Twitter tonight at twitter.com slash OLR.

1754
02:08:35,312 --> 02:08:37,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we're just about to tonight's list list.

1755
02:08:37,692 --> 02:08:38,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited.

1756
02:08:38,473 --> 02:08:41,233
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done one of these in forever and I thought it's high time we do another game.

1757
02:08:41,553 --> 02:08:43,714
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, another bout of news for you.

1758
02:08:45,090 --> 02:08:45,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.

1759
02:08:46,051 --> 02:08:50,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, it's like every other week we have a lawsuit against Zynga.

1760
02:08:50,516 --> 02:08:54,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, even one week we had Zynga suing someone else.

1761
02:08:55,061 --> 02:08:58,545
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, this week it's actually a lawsuit against Zynga over Farmville, of course.

1762
02:08:59,186 --> 02:09:00,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the source code.

1763
02:09:00,247 --> 02:09:05,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, a California-based web developer named, um, Social Apps...

1764
02:09:06,614 --> 02:09:18,400
[SPEAKER_04]: They decided to sue Zynga because of alleged copyright infringement, violation of trade secrets, breach of written contract, breach of implied in fact contract, and breach of confidence.

1765
02:09:19,801 --> 02:09:33,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Their argument is that they entered into agreement with Zynga, whereas Zynga would receive access to their source code for the social apps Facebook game MyFarm in exchange for some form of compensation.

1766
02:09:34,748 --> 02:09:40,651
[SPEAKER_04]: According to the suit, Zynga was given the code, at which point they fled into the night, never to be heard from again.

1767
02:09:41,291 --> 02:09:48,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Social Apps claims that MyFarm's source code provided the foundation for FarmVille, as well as its many derivatives.

1768
02:09:49,114 --> 02:09:59,018
[SPEAKER_04]: They're seeking permanent injunction, damages, attorney's fees, as well as any of Zynga's profits or gains which can be attributed to FarmVille.

1769
02:10:00,111 --> 02:10:01,293
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1770
02:10:15,091 --> 02:10:18,695
[SPEAKER_02]: and then Zynga would give them money that they never got.

1771
02:10:19,056 --> 02:10:20,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what essentially this is about?

1772
02:10:21,238 --> 02:10:22,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I hearing this right?

1773
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:29,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, but I don't know why if you would let someone look at your source code and expect them not to steal it.

1774
02:10:29,508 --> 02:10:30,069
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1775
02:10:30,089 --> 02:10:30,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

1776
02:10:31,252 --> 02:10:32,572
[SPEAKER_02]: or use it in some way, I guess.

1777
02:10:32,673 --> 02:10:33,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1778
02:10:33,253 --> 02:10:35,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you want to do that?

1779
02:10:35,333 --> 02:10:36,034
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be the point?

1780
02:10:36,134 --> 02:10:39,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe Zynga had the idea on how to get it out there.

1781
02:10:39,115 --> 02:10:42,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Zynga, before they put out Farmville, weren't they already huge for Mafia Wars?

1782
02:10:43,256 --> 02:10:43,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1783
02:10:44,196 --> 02:10:44,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't care.

1784
02:10:45,457 --> 02:10:52,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could see where maybe you're going to take somebody else's game and make it better and market it a little better and then make tons of money off of it.

1785
02:10:52,439 --> 02:10:54,360
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you would owe them a piece of the profits.

1786
02:10:54,820 --> 02:10:56,280
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, we're only hearing one side of this.

1787
02:10:56,501 --> 02:10:58,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we had an official response from Zynga yet?

1788
02:10:58,221 --> 02:10:58,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess not, huh?

1789
02:11:00,522 --> 02:11:00,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

1790
02:11:01,377 --> 02:11:01,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Zynga

1791
02:11:11,822 --> 02:11:13,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox.com.

1792
02:11:14,683 --> 02:11:19,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard about this happening before, that games would soon be a part of Xbox.com.

1793
02:11:20,146 --> 02:11:30,190
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, I guess with games for Windows now combining with Xbox.com, there are four free trial games that you can play on the Xbox 360 homepage.

1794
02:11:30,510 --> 02:11:34,171
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play them right in your browser, and you don't have to install them to your computer or anything.

1795
02:11:34,511 --> 02:11:35,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the games that you can play...

1796
02:11:36,232 --> 02:11:48,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants vs. Zombies, Bejeweled 3, Zuma's Revenge, and Text Twist 2 Which are all pretty much PopCap games Or they're stuff that sound right off of... What is it?

1797
02:11:48,223 --> 02:11:57,732
[SPEAKER_02]: The Zone, MSN Zone has been around forever And it had all those games too And it's kind of weird that Microsoft hasn't brought that into the fold If they haven't already Does that still exist?

1798
02:11:58,593 --> 02:12:00,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I had an account there like forever ago

1799
02:12:01,836 --> 02:12:03,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, ZoneMSN.com still exists.

1800
02:12:03,758 --> 02:12:05,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really surprised this isn't in the fold, too.

1801
02:12:05,899 --> 02:12:08,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are like as casual as they get games, though.

1802
02:12:09,802 --> 02:12:12,304
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you can play such winners as Bubbles!

1803
02:12:12,804 --> 02:12:13,945
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play them in your sleep.

1804
02:12:14,165 --> 02:12:14,906
[SPEAKER_07]: That's casual.

1805
02:12:15,106 --> 02:12:15,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Patchworks!

1806
02:12:17,227 --> 02:12:18,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And Fishdom's Spooky Splash!

1807
02:12:21,212 --> 02:12:21,532
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

1808
02:12:43,775 --> 02:12:50,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about something that... I had to make sure that it wasn't a joke when I first saw it.

1809
02:12:51,521 --> 02:12:54,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom is announcing Street Fighter vs. Hello Kitty.

1810
02:12:55,204 --> 02:12:56,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not joking.

1811
02:12:56,525 --> 02:12:57,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, what?

1812
02:12:57,305 --> 02:13:01,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Fall 2012, Street Fighter and Hello Kitty will have a single game together.

1813
02:13:01,849 --> 02:13:05,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could, like, play as Bats Maru and, like, kick E. Honda's ass?

1814
02:13:05,692 --> 02:13:06,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

1815
02:13:06,672 --> 02:13:11,536
[SPEAKER_07]: But they put up a picture of Kitty dressed up as Chun-Li.

1816
02:13:13,044 --> 02:13:14,885
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like just a flash on the screen.

1817
02:13:16,006 --> 02:13:20,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's nothing else, you know, really about it.

1818
02:13:20,288 --> 02:13:26,011
[SPEAKER_07]: But the quote says that... This is from Joshua Izzo, who's the director of licensing with Capcom.

1819
02:13:26,531 --> 02:13:31,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom has long admired Sanrio and their ability to create memorable and cherished lifestyle brands.

1820
02:13:31,533 --> 02:13:35,495
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is a distinct pleasure to partner with them for this new crossover line of merchandise.

1821
02:13:36,056 --> 02:13:37,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like it's just merchandise, really.

1822
02:13:37,897 --> 02:13:38,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1823
02:13:38,797 --> 02:13:40,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just like handbags and wallets.

1824
02:13:40,978 --> 02:13:43,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you imagine them doing Pocket Fighter with Sanrio characters?

1825
02:13:44,579 --> 02:13:45,159
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be weird.

1826
02:13:45,179 --> 02:13:46,659
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be kind of weird, but funny.

1827
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:49,660
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cute.

1828
02:13:51,061 --> 02:13:51,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1829
02:13:51,501 --> 02:13:55,222
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a part of me, when I first heard this story, I was like, no way are they making a game.

1830
02:13:55,242 --> 02:13:58,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I heard it was the merchandising, and I'm like, that is really weird.

1831
02:13:58,403 --> 02:14:02,804
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see the picture of Hello Kitty as Chun-Li, and I'm like, what in the actual fuck is this?

1832
02:14:03,044 --> 02:14:04,645
[SPEAKER_02]: And why do I still really want it?

1833
02:14:04,925 --> 02:14:07,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a Batsmaru done up as Golki.

1834
02:14:08,197 --> 02:14:10,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Batsamaru would probably get the Ryu treatment.

1835
02:14:10,619 --> 02:14:11,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what I'm going to see.

1836
02:14:11,861 --> 02:14:12,681
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Dear Daniel would.

1837
02:14:13,182 --> 02:14:13,542
[SPEAKER_02]: You think?

1838
02:14:13,662 --> 02:14:13,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.

1839
02:14:14,483 --> 02:14:14,883
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1840
02:14:15,884 --> 02:14:17,366
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love this Chun-Li kitty.

1841
02:14:17,426 --> 02:14:18,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so adorable.

1842
02:14:18,727 --> 02:14:19,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that.

1843
02:14:20,248 --> 02:14:20,529
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1844
02:14:22,030 --> 02:14:24,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's get to Listless.

1845
02:14:24,873 --> 02:14:25,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited.

1846
02:14:25,613 --> 02:14:28,876
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done a game here on OLR in a long time, so let's do Listless.

1847
02:14:28,916 --> 02:14:29,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Listless.

1848
02:14:32,213 --> 02:14:36,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, we are going to create the definitive list on a particular topic in gaming.

1849
02:14:37,536 --> 02:14:39,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the way that Listless works.

1850
02:14:39,437 --> 02:14:48,401
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna all go around in studio, and I'm gonna bring on a guest on the phone here in a moment, and we're each gonna bring up our list of three possible choices to put on the list.

1851
02:14:48,421 --> 02:14:49,322
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the difficult part,

1852
02:14:49,642 --> 02:14:52,404
[SPEAKER_02]: We all go around and eliminate one from the list.

1853
02:14:52,424 --> 02:14:56,327
[SPEAKER_02]: That will leave us with a list of eight possible answers for the topic.

1854
02:14:57,047 --> 02:15:00,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you guys in the chat room will get to vote on your number one and number two picks.

1855
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:06,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So our list combined with your votes create the definitive list for this topic.

1856
02:15:06,634 --> 02:15:07,334
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no argument.

1857
02:15:07,354 --> 02:15:09,115
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a highly scientific process.

1858
02:15:09,416 --> 02:15:10,436
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no arguing.

1859
02:15:10,717 --> 02:15:11,917
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the fans want.

1860
02:15:12,518 --> 02:15:12,798
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1861
02:15:13,198 --> 02:15:15,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bet you are dying to know tonight's topic.

1862
02:15:16,055 --> 02:15:16,956
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1863
02:15:34,116 --> 02:15:37,037
[SPEAKER_02]: is adding characters, so what characters should be next?

1864
02:15:37,077 --> 02:15:39,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me bring on a fourth panelist tonight.

1865
02:15:40,358 --> 02:15:51,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I have to admit, I was trying to get Extifer tonight because it would have been fun, and I know he plays the Mortal Kombat series, but unfortunately he had to bow out, so he's not going to be able to be on the show tonight.

1866
02:15:51,301 --> 02:15:52,902
[SPEAKER_07]: He was getting his asshole bleached.

1867
02:15:54,802 --> 02:15:56,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly right.

1868
02:15:56,403 --> 02:15:57,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So he couldn't join us.

1869
02:15:58,245 --> 02:16:03,468
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got a substitute that tends to substitute for Extifer over on Horde House as well when needed.

1870
02:16:03,948 --> 02:16:06,450
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we go.

1871
02:16:06,490 --> 02:16:07,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give him a call right now.

1872
02:16:10,940 --> 02:16:11,761
[SPEAKER_07]: One ringy dingy.

1873
02:16:11,801 --> 02:16:12,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it rings.

1874
02:16:13,022 --> 02:16:13,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1875
02:16:13,342 --> 02:16:13,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Two ringy dingy.

1876
02:16:13,942 --> 02:16:14,322
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

1877
02:16:14,362 --> 02:16:14,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

1878
02:16:15,143 --> 02:16:15,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

1879
02:16:15,563 --> 02:16:16,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Salacious Pop.

1880
02:16:17,024 --> 02:16:17,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?

1881
02:16:17,625 --> 02:16:18,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, not much.

1882
02:16:18,525 --> 02:16:19,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Orange Laundry.

1883
02:16:19,626 --> 02:16:20,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Or welcome back, rather.

1884
02:16:21,547 --> 02:16:27,711
[SPEAKER_09]: And thanks for... Thinking how since I've moved up in here with you, I'm sort of on the show less than when I was when I lived in the Bay.

1885
02:16:27,911 --> 02:16:28,792
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1886
02:16:28,852 --> 02:16:29,412
[SPEAKER_09]: But here you are.

1887
02:16:29,452 --> 02:16:30,273
[SPEAKER_09]: You're back again tonight.

1888
02:16:30,353 --> 02:16:31,854
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome to come over whenever you want.

1889
02:16:31,914 --> 02:16:35,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Filling in for Extover, sort of, who is who I was trying to get for this segment tonight.

1890
02:16:35,757 --> 02:16:37,758
[SPEAKER_02]: But just like on Horde House, you are saving the day.

1891
02:16:39,008 --> 02:16:39,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate it.

1892
02:16:40,089 --> 02:16:47,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, usually we have guests on here to plug websites or their own podcasts.

1893
02:16:47,692 --> 02:16:48,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you want to plug tonight?

1894
02:16:51,594 --> 02:16:58,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I was also the guest commentator on the most recent episode of Horde House for WoW discussion, if anyone cares about that.

1895
02:16:58,538 --> 02:16:59,538
[SPEAKER_09]: But otherwise, not really.

1896
02:16:59,958 --> 02:17:01,579
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I hate WoW and I hate Horde House.

1897
02:17:01,619 --> 02:17:02,299
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bad show.

1898
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:07,182
[SPEAKER_09]: You should probably stop producing it because you're one of the co-hosts.

1899
02:17:08,325 --> 02:17:11,107
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get to tonight's list.

1900
02:17:12,168 --> 02:17:18,994
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you've already been briefed on the topic at hand, so everybody here in studio and on the phone should have their top three answers.

1901
02:17:19,375 --> 02:17:23,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that Mortal Kombat is clearly adding whatever character they want, what character should be next?

1902
02:17:24,319 --> 02:17:35,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we're also relying on those of you in chat to give your answers, because if one of us has an item get duplicated on the list or something where we don't want to say the same thing twice, we often turn to chat.

1903
02:17:35,549 --> 02:17:37,991
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1904
02:17:59,156 --> 02:18:02,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't there always rumors of an Ash vs. Freddy vs. Jason movie?

1905
02:18:03,077 --> 02:18:04,238
[SPEAKER_07]: There was, yeah.

1906
02:18:04,318 --> 02:18:10,119
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually they did a comic of Army of Darkness vs. Marvel Zombies.

1907
02:18:10,579 --> 02:18:11,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was in it.

1908
02:18:11,620 --> 02:18:12,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1909
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:12,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1910
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:17,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So not out of the entire realm of possibility of Ash being in a fighting game.

1911
02:18:17,342 --> 02:18:18,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know Bruce Campbell likes money.

1912
02:18:19,182 --> 02:18:20,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, of course, of course.

1913
02:18:20,443 --> 02:18:21,804
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'll go next.

1914
02:18:22,264 --> 02:18:28,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say my number three answer is Barney the Purple Dinosaur is my number three answer.

1915
02:18:28,187 --> 02:18:28,727
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

1916
02:18:28,827 --> 02:18:31,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't want to perform a fatality on Barney?

1917
02:18:32,416 --> 02:18:33,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you.

1918
02:18:33,896 --> 02:18:35,057
[SPEAKER_02]: You love me.

1919
02:18:35,537 --> 02:18:39,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go and beat up Barney with a baseball bat.

1920
02:18:39,558 --> 02:18:40,898
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll knock him to the floor.

1921
02:18:41,338 --> 02:18:43,539
[SPEAKER_02]: No more purple dinosaur.

1922
02:18:44,099 --> 02:18:44,519
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1923
02:18:44,559 --> 02:18:46,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never sing again on this program, ladies and gentlemen.

1924
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:48,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Barney the Purple Dinosaur.

1925
02:18:49,501 --> 02:18:50,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he even on TV anymore?

1926
02:18:53,081 --> 02:18:55,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, yeah.

1927
02:18:55,884 --> 02:18:57,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a big fan of Barney slash Pop?

1928
02:18:58,987 --> 02:19:08,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I have two half-brothers that are significantly younger than me, and they were toddlers during the early and mid-90s, which was when Barney the Dinosaur ruled the fucking world.

1929
02:19:08,676 --> 02:19:14,921
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, my 16-year-old ass had to sit at home and watch those VHS tapes 20, 30 times in a day.

1930
02:19:15,142 --> 02:19:17,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you feel about Barney in Mortal Kombat?

1931
02:19:18,001 --> 02:19:19,182
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some trauma there.

1932
02:19:19,543 --> 02:19:28,353
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I could get out my PTSD, my post-traumatic stress disorder, by killing him in Mortal Kombat from my teenage years.

1933
02:19:28,453 --> 02:19:29,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be a fan of that.

1934
02:19:29,935 --> 02:19:30,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, awesome.

1935
02:19:31,076 --> 02:19:33,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, we'll go to you next.

1936
02:19:33,219 --> 02:19:34,180
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your number three answer?

1937
02:19:34,981 --> 02:19:37,584
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three answer, Colonel Sanders.

1938
02:19:42,051 --> 02:19:43,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the Man from KFC?

1939
02:19:43,752 --> 02:19:45,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it would be hilarious.

1940
02:19:45,513 --> 02:19:47,194
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me of Project Aco.

1941
02:19:47,954 --> 02:19:49,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Colonel!

1942
02:19:51,076 --> 02:19:51,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

1943
02:19:51,956 --> 02:19:53,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it just would be fun.

1944
02:19:53,317 --> 02:19:57,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Salacious Pop, your number three answer.

1945
02:19:58,700 --> 02:20:05,923
[SPEAKER_09]: This might be a little bit obscure, but for those who remember the Spawn comics, Spawn from the 90s, Angela.

1946
02:20:07,344 --> 02:20:08,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Angela from Spawn.

1947
02:20:08,325 --> 02:20:08,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1948
02:20:11,469 --> 02:20:14,871
[SPEAKER_09]: She's got the TNA and she's got the brutality, so I think she'd be a great fit.

1949
02:20:31,644 --> 02:20:38,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Spawn was a demon from hell after this alien sort of usurped Lucifer from hell.

1950
02:20:38,307 --> 02:20:39,868
[SPEAKER_09]: So Spawn was a demon.

1951
02:20:40,368 --> 02:20:44,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Angela was this badass angel from heaven, except she would just fucking kill you.

1952
02:20:44,891 --> 02:20:46,071
[SPEAKER_09]: She was brutal.

1953
02:20:46,111 --> 02:20:51,414
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't a very feathers and wings and pretty choir angels with halos.

1954
02:20:51,654 --> 02:20:55,196
[SPEAKER_09]: She was really a force to be reckoned with.

1955
02:20:55,336 --> 02:20:58,077
[SPEAKER_09]: So I definitely think she could kick some ass in Mortal Kombat.

1956
02:20:58,277 --> 02:20:58,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Pyramid Head

1957
02:21:15,748 --> 02:21:17,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Pyramid Head from Silent Hill.

1958
02:21:17,569 --> 02:21:18,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Need I ask why?

1959
02:21:19,271 --> 02:21:19,971
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't need to.

1960
02:21:22,053 --> 02:21:24,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I could ask, but then I might end up dead, right?

1961
02:21:25,035 --> 02:21:25,816
[SPEAKER_07]: He's badass.

1962
02:21:25,936 --> 02:21:27,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's actually a serious suggestion.

1963
02:21:27,857 --> 02:21:29,779
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer.

1964
02:21:29,819 --> 02:21:31,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Pyramid Head is on the list there.

1965
02:21:31,380 --> 02:21:32,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that in chat.

1966
02:21:32,501 --> 02:21:38,085
[SPEAKER_02]: and I actually, when I saw it go by in chat, Zether in chat suggested when I saw that, I was like, ooh, I'm taking that one if one of mine gets stolen.

1967
02:21:38,526 --> 02:21:47,432
[SPEAKER_02]: But since now it's already on the list, I'll use my original number two answer, which I'm sorry, this would be badass and this should absolutely be in Mortal Kombat.

1968
02:21:48,033 --> 02:21:56,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And who is a character, I'm gonna ask this question, who is a character more scary than Freddy Krueger and Jason combined?

1969
02:21:57,060 --> 02:22:00,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is the scariest fucking character ever in the history of ever?

1970
02:22:00,282 --> 02:22:01,103
[SPEAKER_07]: My mother pissed off?

1971
02:22:01,863 --> 02:22:02,123
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1972
02:22:02,584 --> 02:22:03,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Pennywise the Clown.

1973
02:22:03,925 --> 02:22:04,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god!

1974
02:22:06,286 --> 02:22:07,667
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my number two answer.

1975
02:22:07,727 --> 02:22:08,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Pennywise the Clown.

1976
02:22:09,188 --> 02:22:11,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I am afraid of clowns and I really hate that clown.

1977
02:22:12,070 --> 02:22:13,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't you want to kill one?

1978
02:22:14,312 --> 02:22:20,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Shang Tsung turned into... Well, you know Shang Tsung's clown fatality was supposed to be Joker's fatality.

1979
02:22:21,037 --> 02:22:21,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

1980
02:22:21,657 --> 02:22:24,840
[SPEAKER_07]: In the DC vs. Mortal Kombat.

1981
02:22:24,860 --> 02:22:25,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.

1982
02:22:25,580 --> 02:22:25,640
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

1983
02:22:28,362 --> 02:22:28,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1984
02:22:48,525 --> 02:22:50,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what's your number two answer?

1985
02:22:50,226 --> 02:22:58,852
[SPEAKER_04]: My number two answer is the most frightening thing beyond Pennywise is a cloud that is just hit media altogether.

1986
02:22:59,332 --> 02:23:00,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be Lady Gaga.

1987
02:23:03,795 --> 02:23:08,756
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone deserves to be torn apart as strange as fucking hell, it's Lady Gaga.

1988
02:23:09,337 --> 02:23:14,718
[SPEAKER_09]: You could do some Ermac and some Noob Saibot fucking crazy morphing shit with those costumes of hers.

1989
02:23:14,778 --> 02:23:15,198
[SPEAKER_02]: You could.

1990
02:23:15,238 --> 02:23:16,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be costume morphing.

1991
02:23:16,939 --> 02:23:21,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Her costumes would be like those bubble dresses would be filled with acid and shit.

1992
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:23,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I would play as Lady Gaga and I would beat your ass.

1993
02:23:25,345 --> 02:23:27,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I would shove a 9-inch stiletto in your character's eye.

1994
02:23:27,608 --> 02:23:29,770
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, Becky said she jumped when you said Pennywise.

1995
02:23:32,213 --> 02:23:34,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, Pennywise is a scary motherfucker.

1996
02:23:34,816 --> 02:23:35,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there you go.

1997
02:23:36,078 --> 02:23:36,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Lady Gaga.

1998
02:23:36,959 --> 02:23:37,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love this.

1999
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:41,605
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Dollar Bill in chat suggests Pennywise turns into a giant spider for a fatality.

2000
02:23:41,745 --> 02:23:41,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah!

2001
02:23:42,425 --> 02:23:43,345
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I'm scared.

2002
02:23:43,765 --> 02:23:46,366
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2003
02:23:46,386 --> 02:23:47,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Salacious Pop, it's over to you.

2004
02:23:47,587 --> 02:23:48,807
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your number two answer?

2005
02:23:49,367 --> 02:23:55,089
[SPEAKER_09]: So the key question to this list list is characters and not people.

2006
02:23:55,329 --> 02:23:58,650
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm saying Rose motherfucking Nyland from the Golden Girls.

2007
02:23:59,770 --> 02:24:00,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Betty White.

2008
02:24:02,291 --> 02:24:02,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Rose Nyland.

2009
02:24:03,491 --> 02:24:03,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring it.

2010
02:24:04,111 --> 02:24:04,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Rose Nyland.

2011
02:24:05,011 --> 02:24:05,712
[SPEAKER_09]: She'll kill you.

2012
02:24:10,009 --> 02:24:11,991
[SPEAKER_09]: And what would Rose Nyland's fatality be?

2013
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:13,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be a story from St.

2014
02:24:13,293 --> 02:24:13,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Olaf?

2015
02:24:14,154 --> 02:24:15,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, she'd tell a St.

2016
02:24:15,396 --> 02:24:17,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Olaf story and you would take a shotgun and you would kill yourself.

2017
02:24:21,694 --> 02:24:26,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wanted my Golden Girls game that was Grandma Got Guns.

2018
02:24:26,399 --> 02:24:30,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was about the Golden Girls just going on a rampage to save their retirement home or whatever.

2019
02:24:30,944 --> 02:24:35,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so Rose Nyland is Salacious Pop's number two answer.

2020
02:24:35,189 --> 02:24:35,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here it is.

2021
02:24:36,170 --> 02:24:38,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Time for the number one answers.

2022
02:24:38,392 --> 02:24:39,433
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go around and get them.

2023
02:24:40,739 --> 02:24:49,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Ash from Evil Dead, Barney the Purple Dinosaur, Colonel Sanders, Angela from Spawn, Pyramid Head, Pennywise the Clown from It, Lady Gaga, and Rose Nyland.

2024
02:25:01,906 --> 02:25:05,170
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta spell that last name for me.

2025
02:25:06,151 --> 02:25:07,953
[SPEAKER_07]: P-I-Z-Z-I-N-I.

2026
02:25:09,254 --> 02:25:10,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, P-I-Z-Z-I-N-I.

2027
02:25:11,076 --> 02:25:12,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know this character either.

2028
02:25:12,157 --> 02:25:13,279
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta explain this to me a little bit.

2029
02:25:13,419 --> 02:25:14,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind I don't read comics.

2030
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:19,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Witchblade, basically, it's like this gauntlet that's stuck on one hand, but it will turn into any weapons and be armor.

2031
02:25:19,686 --> 02:25:21,348
[SPEAKER_07]: So she's wearing this big metal ball.

2032
02:25:22,549 --> 02:25:24,771
[SPEAKER_07]: But other than that, you know...

2033
02:25:49,468 --> 02:26:13,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I just always liked the character so she'd be badass alright I'm gonna get to my number one answer my number one answer is also a very serious answer like I really think and Salacious Pop might be mad at me because I have a feeling this could be who he's thinking too so I apologize in advance if this is your answer Salacious Pop but I have to say a character I would honestly love to see in Mortal Kombat that would kick a lot of ass would be Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill hell yeah

2034

[SPEAKER_02]: Billy Mays here.

2041
02:27:17,937 --> 02:27:22,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Would he actually show off something in his infomercial before killing you with it?

2042
02:27:22,101 --> 02:27:23,422
[SPEAKER_02]: He would throw OxyClean on you.

2043
02:27:23,502 --> 02:27:25,664
[SPEAKER_09]: You would die.

2044
02:27:25,904 --> 02:27:29,527
[SPEAKER_07]: He would spray you with OxyClean and then start scrubbing away until your face came off.

2045
02:27:29,767 --> 02:27:29,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Rogers

2046
02:27:48,067 --> 02:27:49,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Rogers.

2047
02:27:49,268 --> 02:27:51,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you inspired by the ultimate battle of ultimate destiny?

2048
02:27:52,130 --> 02:27:53,812
[SPEAKER_10]: From Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.

2049
02:27:53,912 --> 02:27:54,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that a yes?

2050
02:27:55,313 --> 02:27:57,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:27:57,655 --> 02:27:58,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew it.

2052
02:27:58,756 --> 02:28:00,297
[SPEAKER_10]: So why Mr. Rogers?

2053
02:28:02,419 --> 02:28:03,539
[SPEAKER_09]: No one is that nice.

2054
02:28:03,980 --> 02:28:05,121
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to have a dark side.

2055
02:28:05,401 --> 02:28:07,763
[SPEAKER_07]: He actually was really that nice in person.

2056
02:28:09,813 --> 02:28:19,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like, seriously, you know those a-holes at that particular church in Kansas, I don't want to name them on the show, but we all know who they are, right?

2057
02:28:19,158 --> 02:28:21,359
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the guys that protest at funerals and all that stuff, right?

2058
02:28:21,959 --> 02:28:29,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, actually, a lot of that stuff, it pissed me off, but I didn't get really pissed off until they were going to protest Mr. Rogers' funeral.

2059
02:28:29,403 --> 02:28:33,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you don't fucking, like, Mr. Rogers will fuck you up.

2060
02:28:34,005 --> 02:28:34,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

2063
02:28:42,370 --> 02:28:45,232

2064
02:28:45,633 --> 02:28:46,373
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what will happen.

2065
02:28:46,393 --> 02:28:47,234

[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2113
02:31:13,587 --> 02:31:18,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have to say Barney because I find him even more traumatic than anything else in the universe.

2114
02:31:19,049 --> 02:31:23,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And just, I wouldn't be able to fight him because I would have to pause the game and go throw up.

2115
02:31:23,350 --> 02:31:26,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Barney the purple dinosaur has been stricken from the list.

2116
02:31:26,952 --> 02:31:31,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to remove, I'm sorry, I do think this is a great idea, but it's just a little too crazy.

2117
02:31:32,054 --> 02:31:33,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking Billy Mays off the list.

2118
02:31:33,814 --> 02:31:36,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy Mays is not worthy of the list, so it has been stricken from the list.

2119
02:31:36,975 --> 02:31:38,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2120
02:31:39,515 --> 02:31:46,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, unfortunately, it's not the golden girl I would have picked, so, uh, Rose Nyland has to be removed up the list.

2121
02:31:46,024 --> 02:31:47,406
[SPEAKER_04]: B. Arthur was a close second.

2122
02:31:47,426 --> 02:31:50,230
[SPEAKER_07]: B. Arthur is a badass bitch.

2123
02:31:50,290 --> 02:31:53,715
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have just went with Maude, and then there's Maude.

2124
02:31:55,537 --> 02:31:56,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to share this with you.

2125
02:31:57,158 --> 02:31:58,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you ever watch the Deadpool PSAs?

2126
02:31:59,639 --> 02:31:59,820
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2127
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Deadpool had a minor obsession with Bea Arthur.

2128
02:32:02,861 --> 02:32:04,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, a major obsession with Bea Arthur.

2129
02:32:04,042 --> 02:32:04,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2130
02:32:04,722 --> 02:32:08,504
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had a poster in the thing that said, Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like Bea?

2131
02:32:09,425 --> 02:32:10,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

2132
02:32:11,026 --> 02:32:11,366
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2133
02:32:11,786 --> 02:32:14,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Rose Nyland has been stricken from the list.

2134
02:32:14,227 --> 02:32:16,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So, nine items remain.

2135
02:32:16,589 --> 02:32:17,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Salacious Pop, it comes down to you.

2136
02:32:18,049 --> 02:32:20,030
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these must come off the list for us to proceed.

2137
02:32:20,070 --> 02:32:21,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Which of these is not worthy of the list, Salacious Pop?

2138
02:32:23,352 --> 02:32:29,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Pennywise the Clown However, wouldn't it have been cool to actually get Tim Curry to voice him?

2139
02:32:43,240 --> 02:32:44,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

2140
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:47,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just have Tim Curry be... I'm so angry.

2141
02:32:47,361 --> 02:32:49,101
[SPEAKER_12]: Tim Curry should be... Frank should be in it.

2142
02:32:49,701 --> 02:32:51,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Frank and Carter should be in it instead.

2143
02:32:51,842 --> 02:32:52,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so angry.

2144
02:32:53,822 --> 02:32:54,843
[SPEAKER_02]: No Nookie for a week.

2145
02:32:54,983 --> 02:32:55,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2146
02:32:56,443 --> 02:32:56,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

2147
02:32:57,423 --> 02:33:00,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw says how awesome it would be if Ash was in Mortal Kombat.

2148
02:33:01,304 --> 02:33:04,905
[SPEAKER_07]: His little intro animation would be him showing up and saying, Okay, she-bitch, let's go.

2149
02:33:05,865 --> 02:33:06,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here it is.

2150
02:33:06,986 --> 02:33:08,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are the eight items you can vote on tonight.

2151
02:33:09,128 --> 02:33:21,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Ash from Evil Dead, Colonel Sanders, Angela from Spawn, Pyramid Head, Lady Gaga, Sarah Pizzini from Witchblade, Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill, and Mr. Rogers.

2152
02:33:21,258 --> 02:33:22,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the items left on the list.

2153
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:26,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Slash pop, there is a death mob going on in chat.

2154
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:29,661
[SPEAKER_02]: This always happens, though.

2155
02:33:29,681 --> 02:33:30,702
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a part of this list.

2156
02:33:31,263 --> 02:33:33,264
[SPEAKER_02]: A popular answer always gets taken off the list.

2157
02:33:33,284 --> 02:33:34,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, no kicking allowed.

2158
02:33:34,486 --> 02:33:34,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.

2159
02:33:36,167 --> 02:33:37,068
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not allowed to kick him.

2160
02:33:37,108 --> 02:33:38,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't kick him from chat.

2161
02:33:38,690 --> 02:33:39,711
[SPEAKER_09]: That is hilarious.

2162
02:33:39,811 --> 02:33:40,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't mind.

2163
02:33:40,451 --> 02:33:41,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on a minute.

2164
02:33:41,052 --> 02:33:41,693
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

2165
02:33:42,013 --> 02:33:44,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma needs to remember who the queen bee is here in chat.

2166
02:33:45,696 --> 02:33:47,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow.

2167
02:33:48,157 --> 02:33:49,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there we go.

2168
02:33:49,698 --> 02:33:50,178
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

2169
02:33:50,258 --> 02:33:52,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to post that list in our chat room right now.

2170
02:33:52,799 --> 02:33:58,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Send a private message to Sky with your number one and your number two answers.

2171
02:33:59,362 --> 02:34:02,003
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't put which is one and which is two, I will assume...

2172
02:34:02,843 --> 02:34:04,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Your first one is one and the other one is two.

2173
02:34:04,865 --> 02:34:05,305
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

2174
02:34:05,345 --> 02:34:14,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, Ash from Evil Dead, Colonel Sanders, Angela from Spawn, Pyramid Head, Lady Gaga, Sarah Pazzini from Witchblade, Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill, and Mr. Rogers.

2175
02:34:15,272 --> 02:34:18,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Send your number one and number two answers to Sky in the chatroom.

2176
02:34:18,434 --> 02:34:22,516
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll collect your votes and let you know what you came up with in just a little while here on the show.

2177
02:34:22,857 --> 02:34:23,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Salacious Pop?

2178
02:34:24,918 --> 02:34:25,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes?

2179
02:34:26,519 --> 02:34:28,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you reading what the chatroom is saying now?

2180
02:34:28,861 --> 02:34:29,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2181
02:34:29,461 --> 02:34:30,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you regretting your decision?

2182
02:34:31,078 --> 02:34:34,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm being egged on to retaliate by someone and I won't say who.

2183
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:39,304
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will respect the fact that I have ops temporarily and I will not do it.

2184
02:34:39,644 --> 02:34:40,225
[SPEAKER_09]: So sorry.

2185
02:34:40,845 --> 02:34:41,185
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2186
02:34:41,265 --> 02:34:45,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, you don't want to have a no getting laid warranty for two weeks.

2187
02:34:46,509 --> 02:34:47,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.

2188
02:34:47,530 --> 02:34:47,770
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2189
02:34:48,211 --> 02:34:56,716
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, SlicesPop, thank you once again for filling in tonight, and we appreciate you had some great answers tonight, despite the elimination controversy.

2190
02:34:57,337 --> 02:34:59,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickly, anything you want to plug, like your Twitter or anything like that?

2191
02:34:59,778 --> 02:35:02,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you do writing online or whatever that you want to plug.

2192
02:35:02,740 --> 02:35:05,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say that don't worry, you'll float.

2193
02:35:05,242 --> 02:35:06,403
[SPEAKER_09]: We all float down here.

2194
02:35:08,164 --> 02:35:09,324
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, there you go.

2195
02:35:10,105 --> 02:35:11,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, SlicesPop.

2196
02:35:12,206 --> 02:35:12,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2197
02:35:12,647 --> 02:35:12,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2198
02:35:15,333 --> 02:35:19,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, while those votes come in, let's get back into some other gaming news.

2199
02:35:19,655 --> 02:35:24,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to go over to Loki with some news about GameCube games.

2200
02:35:24,276 --> 02:35:38,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, apparently Nintendo Director of Entertainment and Trend Marketing, Amber McCollum, was quoted during an interview with Nintendo Gal on the subject of GameCube games not being playable on the upcoming Wii U.

2201
02:35:39,582 --> 02:35:49,246
[SPEAKER_04]: McCollum said, GameCube disc will not be compatible with the Wii U, but a number of games that were playable on the GameCube can be downloaded from WiiWare.

2202
02:35:50,347 --> 02:35:51,407
[SPEAKER_04]: And people were like, really?

2203
02:35:51,427 --> 02:35:53,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that going to be possible?

2204
02:35:53,748 --> 02:35:58,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to be able to download games via some sort of storage device or something like that?

2205
02:35:59,510 --> 02:36:23,904
[SPEAKER_04]: of course when asked to clarify that statement they went and said to clarify the capabilities of the Wii U system as correctly stated the Wii U will not be able to play Nintendo GameCube disc however Nintendo has not made any announcement regarding download content so they kind of backstepped a little bit but sounds like that maybe that's something that they're going to be working towards is having GameCube games downloadable

2206
02:36:27,062 --> 02:36:28,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that will really happen?

2207
02:36:28,463 --> 02:36:31,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it would seem to me like the GameCube games are kind of large.

2208
02:36:31,425 --> 02:36:33,546
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, we have Xbox 360 games and stuff like that.

2209
02:36:34,006 --> 02:36:36,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if they would do that.

2210
02:36:36,348 --> 02:36:43,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if anything, they would just re-release GameCube games or touch them up somewhat and re-release them on it.

2211
02:36:43,412 --> 02:36:47,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they were doing the new Play Control stuff where it was on a Wii disc but it was a GameCube game.

2212
02:36:47,415 --> 02:36:48,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see more of that happening.

2213
02:36:49,256 --> 02:36:49,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

2214
02:36:49,996 --> 02:36:52,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it gives them an excuse to charge more money and...

2215
02:36:52,899 --> 02:36:56,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I would gladly pay for F-Zero GX all over again though to be honest.

2216
02:36:56,266 --> 02:36:57,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to lie.

2217
02:36:57,609 --> 02:36:58,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Take my money.

2218
02:36:58,591 --> 02:37:00,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I would gladly pay you tomorrow for a hamburger today.

2219
02:37:01,403 --> 02:37:06,907
[SPEAKER_02]: You be quiet Alright, moving on to a story about Iram Do you know the company Iram?

2220
02:37:06,927 --> 02:37:07,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever heard of Iram?

2221
02:37:07,668 --> 02:37:25,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Freakin' R-Type That's right, they made R-Type They made a lot of other interesting games too But here's the deal R-Type, there's a few of these games on the PSP Like there's R-Type's Tactics on the PSP R-Type Tactics 2 There's also the game archives have R-Types and R-Types Delta These are all over the PlayStation Network and PlayStation Go

2222
02:37:25,862 --> 02:37:26,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?

2223
02:37:26,783 --> 02:37:29,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Come August 11th, these games are going away.

2224
02:37:29,924 --> 02:37:32,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Irem is taking their catalog off of the PlayStation Network.

2225
02:37:33,366 --> 02:37:36,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And same thing goes for their specific PlayStation Home lounges.

2226
02:37:37,608 --> 02:37:40,970
[SPEAKER_02]: They had some, I guess, nine lounges that were about these games.

2227
02:37:41,450 --> 02:37:42,931
[SPEAKER_02]: They are all going away.

2228
02:37:44,431 --> 02:37:48,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the Doki Doki Suikoden Lounge is the only one that's staying.

2229
02:37:48,575 --> 02:37:48,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2230
02:37:49,736 --> 02:37:55,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Irem has not said why they're going away, but these games on PSP are no longer going to be available.

2231
02:37:55,900 --> 02:37:57,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Now a lot of these I've never heard of.

2232
02:37:57,602 --> 02:38:05,988
[SPEAKER_02]: There's games like, these are all very Japanese titles, Mosukesu based on Cartoon Con, Bumpy Trot Beagle Battle Tournament.

2233
02:38:06,208 --> 02:38:08,890
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all games that are downloadable right now on PlayStation Network.

2234
02:38:08,910 --> 02:38:10,632
[SPEAKER_02]: They are going to be going away on August 11th.

2235
02:38:11,332 --> 02:38:16,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if this is some type of retaliation, so to speak, for the PSN being down for so long.

2236
02:38:17,916 --> 02:38:18,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2237
02:38:18,436 --> 02:38:22,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, it's probably just licensing coming up and they decided not to renew it or something.

2238
02:38:23,519 --> 02:38:23,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

2239
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:25,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well there you go.

2240
02:38:26,061 --> 02:38:28,882
[SPEAKER_02]: They are coming off of PlayStation Network, so enjoy them while you can.

2241
02:38:28,982 --> 02:38:32,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Not like I can't bust out the master system and play our type.

2242
02:38:32,664 --> 02:38:33,665
[SPEAKER_02]: The original system, right?

2243
02:38:34,525 --> 02:38:35,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

2244
02:38:36,486 --> 02:38:45,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and pulls out some of her favorite emails to read right now.

2245
02:38:45,908 --> 02:38:49,388
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, this is also the last call for votes in tonight's list list.

2246
02:38:49,428 --> 02:38:51,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Get them in now or they will not count.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2251
02:38:58,803 --> 02:38:59,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Greetings, OLR!

2252
02:38:59,823 --> 02:39:02,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for helping my commute to work a more pleasant one with your podcast.

2253
02:39:03,465 --> 02:39:07,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I really find this debate of online passes and used games quite interesting.

2254
02:39:07,126 --> 02:39:12,648
[SPEAKER_07]: A long-time gamer like yourselves, I am actually quite indifferent about this tactic.

2255
02:39:13,028 --> 02:39:17,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I do buy most of my games new, like Rob, though I do dabble in the occasional used title here and there as well.

2256
02:39:18,430 --> 02:39:27,433
[SPEAKER_07]: While I am not foolish enough to believe that every used game equals a lost new game sale, it would be equally foolish to assume that new game sales aren't somewhat hurt by the used game market.

2257
02:39:27,853 --> 02:39:28,213
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

2258
02:39:56,841 --> 02:39:59,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that this slippery slope argument exists.

2259
02:40:00,103 --> 02:40:07,646
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time, I give consumers more credit than Loki may that they can look at each issue on a case-by-case basis and reject ideas that they feel cross the line.

2260
02:40:08,267 --> 02:40:16,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I've often wondered if there could be a moratorium on used game sales placed for maybe three or six months so that new games aren't hindered by used game sales.

2261
02:40:17,211 --> 02:40:23,454
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of the day, both used games and new games have their place for now, and I can't begrudge anyone for choosing what solution works for them.

2262
02:40:23,874 --> 02:40:25,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to all of you, Dark Charger.

2263
02:40:26,215 --> 02:40:31,317
[SPEAKER_07]: PS, if the show is interested in a new copy of Adobe Lightroom 3, yes.

2264
02:40:32,817 --> 02:40:34,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie is, yes.

2265
02:40:35,558 --> 02:40:37,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Email me and I will send it to you as a gift.

2266
02:40:38,239 --> 02:40:39,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks again for the podcast.

2267
02:40:39,660 --> 02:40:41,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that I could listen live more often.

2268
02:40:42,221 --> 02:40:42,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

2269
02:40:44,186 --> 02:40:44,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Saved.

2270
02:40:47,649 --> 02:40:56,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the idea is interesting about the whole moratorium, but I just don't think it's possible because you'd be telling people they can't sell their own new product.

2271
02:40:56,314 --> 02:41:00,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's to stop me from going to my neighbor saying, oh, yeah, you want this game?

2272
02:41:00,156 --> 02:41:00,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really play it.

2273
02:41:00,877 --> 02:41:01,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, give me 40 bucks.

2274
02:41:01,978 --> 02:41:10,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It would never happen because you're basically telling people that when they're done with their game that they can't trade it back into... I mean, okay, let's say that they're able to sell it back to GameStop, but GameStop's not going to sell it.

2275
02:41:10,663 --> 02:41:11,163
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2276
02:41:33,608 --> 02:41:46,234
[SPEAKER_04]: If you basically ban used game sales or make it not very pretty to the fact that it devalues the used game, then they're not going to have money to buy that new game that you want them to buy.

2277
02:41:46,334 --> 02:41:49,115
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see, you're in turn hurting yourself.

2278
02:41:49,876 --> 02:42:00,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But they won't figure that out until everyone jumps on board with this type of scheme and then it affects them down the line and they're like, ah, crap, why did we do that?

2279
02:42:04,962 --> 02:42:06,843
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I'm kind of in the boat as this guy.

2280
02:42:06,863 --> 02:42:09,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he already said he's kind of like me where you either buy it new or you don't buy it.

2281
02:42:10,124 --> 02:42:16,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially considering what I talked about at the top of the show, as in one particular store I will not be shopping at anymore for new or used games.

2282
02:42:16,447 --> 02:42:18,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's your biggest used market right there.

2283
02:42:19,208 --> 02:42:21,489
[SPEAKER_02]: But not to say I would never buy a game used.

2284
02:42:21,529 --> 02:42:24,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's obviously other people trying to get in that market as well.

2285
02:42:24,431 --> 02:42:26,832
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, I find now by the time...

2286
02:42:27,412 --> 02:42:31,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go back and get an old game and I'd be actually looking for it used.

2287
02:42:31,193 --> 02:42:33,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you usually can't find the new game used.

2288
02:42:33,534 --> 02:42:34,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so hard to get it.

2289
02:42:35,155 --> 02:42:38,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the last new game that I bought used was the Tron game.

2290
02:42:39,757 --> 02:42:42,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And the minute I played it, I could see why somebody sold it back right away.

2291
02:42:43,038 --> 02:42:47,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually, if a game's really that good, you can't find it used right away.

2292
02:42:48,180 --> 02:42:51,121
[SPEAKER_07]: We go buy used games, though, fairly regularly.

2293
02:42:51,681 --> 02:42:54,222
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's just because we might want to finish a collection.

2294
02:42:54,639 --> 02:43:13,333
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think at this point if I did want to go get a used game I would just check the price on Amazon or you know other competing internet websites like Best Buy or whatever and see what the price is and if it's good enough I'll just buy it online so until one of those stores pisses me off then I'll stop shopping there too alright next email

2295
02:43:15,037 --> 02:43:15,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, LLR.

2296
02:43:15,998 --> 02:43:19,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's an Orange Lounge Foodio question, but it does relate to a video game.

2297
02:43:19,682 --> 02:43:21,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think Domino's will ever bring back the Noid?

2298
02:43:22,005 --> 02:43:23,747
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a new Yo!

2299
02:43:23,807 --> 02:43:24,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Noid game, dammit.

2300
02:43:26,690 --> 02:43:31,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Brought to you by Sizzler, home of the three-day-old salad bar that tastes like shit and gives you the squits.

2301
02:43:31,796 --> 02:43:32,397
[SPEAKER_07]: That's from Chiggers.

2302
02:43:33,390 --> 02:43:33,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Eww!

2303
02:43:33,530 --> 02:43:33,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Eww!

2304
02:43:33,750 --> 02:43:33,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Eww!

2305
02:43:49,445 --> 02:43:49,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2306
02:43:50,345 --> 02:43:52,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I think Domino's would ever bring back the Noid?

2307
02:43:52,406 --> 02:43:52,646
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2308
02:43:52,846 --> 02:43:58,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Domino's did this really interesting thing where they kind of came out and admitted that their pizza tastes like shit and that they're going to totally redo it.

2309
02:43:58,828 --> 02:44:02,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It was this very interesting campaign that they did, and it worked.

2310
02:44:02,389 --> 02:44:05,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Domino's sales have been up quite a bit in the past year or so.

2311
02:44:05,389 --> 02:44:07,370
[SPEAKER_02]: People like that self-deprecating sense of humor.

2312
02:44:07,650 --> 02:44:12,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think because of that, because Domino's is trying to distance themselves from the past, you're not going to see the Noid ever come back.

2313
02:44:12,851 --> 02:44:14,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Noid is something that's very 80s.

2314
02:44:14,112 --> 02:44:14,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

2315
02:44:15,632 --> 02:44:18,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Never say never, but you're not going to see it in the next five years.

2316
02:44:18,913 --> 02:44:19,753
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2317
02:44:19,853 --> 02:44:21,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And sadly, that would mean the same for the Yo!

2318
02:44:21,854 --> 02:44:22,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Noid game.

2319
02:44:22,654 --> 02:44:23,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a question for you guys, though.

2320
02:44:24,235 --> 02:44:28,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we'll see any other commercial product video games again?

2321
02:44:28,736 --> 02:44:30,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we used to get these all the time back in the day.

2322
02:44:30,857 --> 02:44:34,038
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the Mick Kids game, the California Raisins game.

2323
02:44:34,158 --> 02:44:35,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the hell is my damn Burger King Connect game?

2324
02:44:35,878 --> 02:44:38,479
[SPEAKER_02]: The Burger King games were the most recent ones.

2325
02:44:38,519 --> 02:44:41,500
[SPEAKER_04]: They're supposed to have the Burger King Connect game, and they never fucking put it out.

2326
02:44:41,880 --> 02:44:42,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2327
02:44:43,361 --> 02:44:43,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

2328
02:44:45,799 --> 02:44:47,421
[SPEAKER_07]: and now Burger King's all over Transformers.

2329
02:44:47,441 --> 02:44:48,603
[SPEAKER_02]: But no games about chiggers.

2330
02:44:50,606 --> 02:44:51,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Transformers, all Hasbro.

2331
02:44:51,928 --> 02:44:52,248
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

2332
02:44:52,389 --> 02:44:52,869
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

2333
02:44:53,711 --> 02:44:54,852
[SPEAKER_07]: How about another email?

2334
02:44:55,213 --> 02:44:55,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, another email.

2335
02:44:55,994 --> 02:44:56,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2336
02:44:56,354 --> 02:44:56,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2337
02:44:58,032 --> 02:45:04,776
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a few shows behind in my listening, but I just want to respond to Rob with his opinion that college is a waste of money and you learn better by doing.

2338
02:45:05,496 --> 02:45:06,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I 100% agree.

2339
02:45:07,237 --> 02:45:14,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent five years in college, earned two bachelor's degrees, television production and Asian studies, graduated summa cum laude in the top 10% of my class.

2340
02:45:15,221 --> 02:45:19,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I can be quoted as saying frequently that the only good thing that I got back from college was a husband.

2341
02:45:20,244 --> 02:45:25,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from being an abstract requirement, BKA have a BA when we don't care which one,

2342
02:45:26,207 --> 02:45:28,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody cares about all the painstaking work I did in college.

2343
02:45:28,828 --> 02:45:30,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't touched editing software since I left.

2344
02:45:30,589 --> 02:45:33,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't spoken Japanese, Chinese, or Spanish since I left.

2345
02:45:33,910 --> 02:45:37,232
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the hard-earned knowledge has faded away and the reality has set in.

2346
02:45:37,332 --> 02:45:43,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you're going to be a doctor, lawyer, or something that requires daily use of the knowledge you got in college, it's ultimately a costly waste of time.

2347
02:45:44,315 --> 02:45:50,922
[SPEAKER_07]: The job I have now has diddly to do with my fancy degrees and I'm still paying on the $2,000 I have left in college bills.

2348
02:45:51,382 --> 02:45:56,287
[SPEAKER_07]: When I have kids, they're going to trade school and learn to be plumbers or HVAC technicians or car mechanics.

2349
02:45:56,867 --> 02:46:04,635
[SPEAKER_07]: At least then I will be secure in the knowledge that what they've learned is useful and the very least will save them money because they can fix their own stuff.

2350
02:46:04,695 --> 02:46:05,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Holly D.

2351
02:46:06,036 --> 02:46:18,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I do have to say though, in the design field, like what I'm in, college ends up being useful because the classes that I take have practical application for what I'm doing.

2352
02:46:19,284 --> 02:46:20,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I've built my portfolio.

2353
02:46:21,285 --> 02:46:22,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I've marketed myself.

2354
02:46:22,726 --> 02:46:24,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm already getting work and I haven't finished college.

2355
02:46:25,448 --> 02:46:26,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just saying.

2356
02:46:26,368 --> 02:46:27,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I want to be careful too.

2357
02:46:27,389 --> 02:46:31,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to become like this anti-college spokesperson because that wasn't quite the point of my rant.

2358
02:46:31,171 --> 02:46:34,273
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think what I was meaning to get at is that it's not for everyone.

2359
02:46:34,693 --> 02:46:38,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some people kind of feel like there's this necessity, like I have to go, I have to go.

2360
02:46:39,456 --> 02:46:40,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe you don't.

2361
02:46:41,457 --> 02:46:42,618
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

2362
02:47:10,513 --> 02:47:14,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you don't do nothing but school, okay?

2363
02:47:14,914 --> 02:47:18,014
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're gonna go to college, make sure you do some extracurricular activities.

2364
02:47:18,314 --> 02:47:19,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you do internships.

2365
02:47:20,115 --> 02:47:30,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, take, I mean, I know it might sound ludicrous, like I gotta do something and don't get paid, but the networking experience you're gonna get from that are gonna mean so much more than your A's and B's.

2366
02:47:31,117 --> 02:47:31,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm serious.

2367
02:47:31,817 --> 02:47:35,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, make friends with your teachers who are working in the field.

2368
02:47:36,378 --> 02:47:37,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're not in high school anymore.

2369
02:47:37,738 --> 02:47:38,918
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not cool to hate your teachers.

2370
02:47:39,286 --> 02:47:42,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, keep in mind, now, I'm in school to be a graphic designer.

2371
02:47:43,549 --> 02:47:47,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was funny because I learned a lot of the programs and stuff on my own.

2372
02:47:47,792 --> 02:47:52,295
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have picked up so much in design technique and in theory.

2373
02:47:52,715 --> 02:48:00,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And just in studying, you know, the best classes I've taken are my two art history classes and my typography class.

2374
02:48:00,900 --> 02:48:02,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Those have been my favorites so far.

2375
02:48:02,101 --> 02:48:05,263
[SPEAKER_07]: That and my portfolio class, which you've seen my portfolio.

2376
02:48:06,124 --> 02:48:08,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out fully interview ready.

2377
02:48:09,886 --> 02:48:11,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got my portfolio online.

2378
02:48:11,187 --> 02:48:13,649
[SPEAKER_07]: If anyone wants to see my stuff, just let me know and I will show you.

2379
02:48:13,949 --> 02:48:14,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And then hire me, please.

2380
02:48:16,410 --> 02:48:17,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this, too.

2381
02:48:17,151 --> 02:48:24,255
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be surprised to hear me say this, but I actually think it also would be a good use of your time if this is a scene you are into and if this is something you are into.

2382
02:48:24,915 --> 02:48:26,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Join a fraternity or a sorority.

2383
02:48:52,250 --> 02:49:04,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and also find different clubs or online groups that people in your field are going to like, you know, if you're in engineering, look for stuff through the Department of Engineers, you know, that type of stuff.

2384
02:49:04,834 --> 02:49:09,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to go to college just to drink, do yourself and do the college a favor and don't go to college.

2385
02:49:10,755 --> 02:49:11,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Or at least get a liberal arts degree.

2386
02:49:12,676 --> 02:49:13,456
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not even that.

2387
02:49:13,476 --> 02:49:16,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to say, do yourself a favor and don't go to college.

2388
02:49:16,797 --> 02:49:18,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you will be wasting money.

2389
02:49:18,518 --> 02:49:19,538
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be wasting time.

2390
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:31,024
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing about college though that I will say is that it gives you a chance to experiment with new ideas and to pick different things.

2391
02:49:31,384 --> 02:49:35,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I've changed my major like nine times before I finally just decided to go with what I loved anyway.

2392
02:49:36,486 --> 02:49:39,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I started off as a forensic geology major.

2393
02:49:40,028 --> 02:49:40,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know that?

2394
02:49:41,629 --> 02:49:44,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I studied rocks for blood.

2395
02:49:45,670 --> 02:49:46,791
[SPEAKER_07]: It was boring as fuck.

2396
02:49:48,064 --> 02:50:13,154
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you know I changed my major so many times and finally decided to stick with art with something in the art field I hate doing illustration for other people because it's not my drawings anymore but I love doing design for other people and I've developed a passion for it but I wouldn't have known that design was where my heart was until I tried to do illustration and I tried to do all this other stuff and eventually I found the right path

2397
02:50:14,134 --> 02:50:18,077
[SPEAKER_07]: by, and I even found out that specifically print is my passion.

2398
02:50:18,877 --> 02:50:21,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would never have known that if I had not taken typography.

2399
02:50:22,340 --> 02:50:22,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Right then and there.

2400
02:50:23,220 --> 02:50:24,601
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had not taken the InDesign class.

2401
02:50:25,342 --> 02:50:33,367
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm just saying, you know, as that example, school is a good place to experiment without getting a job that you're going to hate.

2402
02:50:33,948 --> 02:50:34,428
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

2403
02:50:35,169 --> 02:50:35,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

2404
02:50:36,802 --> 02:50:38,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to continue my rant.

2405
02:50:38,825 --> 02:50:41,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I said what I said a couple shows ago and I stand by that.

2406
02:50:44,013 --> 02:50:46,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not for everyone, but it might be for you and that's okay.

2407
02:50:47,338 --> 02:50:47,878
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your money.

2408
02:50:47,938 --> 02:50:49,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Spend it how you want to spend it.

2409
02:50:51,010 --> 02:50:51,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Next email.

2410
02:50:52,591 --> 02:50:53,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, OLR crew.

2411
02:50:53,451 --> 02:50:55,892
[SPEAKER_07]: This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.

2412
02:50:56,532 --> 02:51:02,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure you have already talked and discussed about Capcom this week, but I want to vent a little and share my two cents on their most recent happenings.

2413
02:51:02,614 --> 02:51:07,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, needless to say, as many people have probably said now, I pretty much lost all faith in Capcom.

2414
02:51:08,076 --> 02:51:11,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it because of the release of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3?

2415
02:51:11,738 --> 02:51:14,919
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I actually was pretty excited about...

2416
02:51:16,079 --> 02:51:42,875
[SPEAKER_07]: especially because of the addition of Phoenix Wright yeah granted they're doing an update to a game not even 9 months after the release of the first edition but Capcom has always done this kind of stuff with all their fighting series and I've learned to accept it if you know Capcom then you pretty much expect it to do so which by the way that actually did remind me of something when they did all the different matching service and different versions of Street Fighter 3 like Second Strike and Third Impact that's the same thing

2417
02:51:45,055 --> 02:51:46,836
[SPEAKER_07]: So why have I lost my confidence in Capcom?

2418
02:51:46,996 --> 02:51:49,277
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because of all their recent decisions as a company.

2419
02:51:49,757 --> 02:51:52,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of things that I can name or list here.

2420
02:51:53,278 --> 02:52:10,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Unnecessary DRM, Mercenaries 3DS, Bionic Commander Rearm 2, Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition, The Cancellation of Games, Mega Man Universe, Unnecessary Reboots, Devil May Cry, No Localizations of Games People Truly Want, No World of Monster Hunter, nor Ace Attorney Investigations 2 being localized.

2421
02:52:10,843 --> 02:52:15,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Little by little, Capcom has done really bad decisions that have really affected the fans.

2422
02:52:16,546 --> 02:52:25,552
[SPEAKER_07]: A company that was recently known to cater to the fans, and still even now they kind of do it, is losing a lot of stuff that have their fans really angry, including me.

2423
02:52:26,012 --> 02:52:29,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the straw that broke the camel was the cancellation of Mega Man Legends 3.

2424
02:52:30,314 --> 02:52:35,017
[SPEAKER_07]: People have wanted that game for so long and they just took it from them like if nothing happened.

2425
02:52:35,517 --> 02:52:35,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And with this...

2426
02:52:36,878 --> 02:52:38,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Also comes the slow killing of Mega Man.

2427
02:52:38,880 --> 02:52:43,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Mega Man X was the most wanted for MVC3 and they didn't mention him being in Ultimate.

2428
02:52:44,404 --> 02:52:49,607
[SPEAKER_07]: All of those things they've done, little by little, have created a really big ball of shit and they can't hide it now.

2429
02:52:50,048 --> 02:52:53,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And even if they do, the stinkest of big people will be reminded because of it.

2430
02:52:53,650 --> 02:53:02,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom has created their own demise, and unless they do something to fix this problem, or at least they admit they do have a problem, I won't be buying any game they release anytime soon.

2431
02:53:02,576 --> 02:53:08,079
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean it, not even the Darkstalkers teaser they showed in their Street Fighter cross-techin' panel.

2432
02:53:08,360 --> 02:53:10,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that hasn't even come up in the show yet, but yeah.

2433
02:53:11,030 --> 02:53:18,615
[SPEAKER_07]: A game I have wanted them to make for a long time won't blind me of all they have done to lose me as a fan.

2434
02:53:18,956 --> 02:53:22,218
[SPEAKER_07]: As Diekmann said in his Tumblr and Twitter, Capcom, it's not me, it's you.

2435
02:53:22,758 --> 02:53:26,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for reading this and for keep on giving gamers a voice.

2436
02:53:27,042 --> 02:53:27,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft.

2437
02:53:30,003 --> 02:53:30,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Last email?

2438
02:53:31,384 --> 02:53:33,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to see how long that holds.

2439
02:53:33,125 --> 02:53:34,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not trying to be like a jerk about it.

2440
02:53:34,806 --> 02:53:36,808
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, usually this internet rage.

2441
02:53:37,048 --> 02:53:39,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll announce something you just have to have.

2442
02:53:39,870 --> 02:53:53,580
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, obviously Capcom surprisingly went from all the fans love them and have very loyal fans to literally within the scope of two weeks have become like, quote, the Japanese Bobby Kotick.

2443
02:53:53,720 --> 02:53:54,420
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

2444
02:53:54,480 --> 02:53:56,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's just interesting.

2445
02:53:56,081 --> 02:53:56,882
[SPEAKER_02]: How the mighty have fallen.

2446
02:53:57,823 --> 02:53:58,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, I...

2447
02:53:59,964 --> 02:54:00,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Last email?

2448
02:54:18,778 --> 02:54:19,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, LLR.

2449
02:54:19,958 --> 02:54:24,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wanted to write in after the last few weeks comments from Calcom's David Reeves.

2450
02:54:25,240 --> 02:54:27,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I was more than a little miffed at what he said.

2451
02:54:28,101 --> 02:54:39,585
[SPEAKER_07]: This coming from the same guy who used to run Sony of Europe and said that when the PS3 was launching that we have built up a certain brand equity over time since the launch of PlayStation in 1995 and PS2 in 2000.

2452
02:54:39,745 --> 02:54:44,547
[SPEAKER_07]: The first 5 million are going to buy it, whatever it is, even if it doesn't have games.

2453
02:54:45,387 --> 02:54:47,808
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he linked to the full article interview.

2454
02:54:48,508 --> 02:54:50,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm not going to rant, so I'll be off Catastrophic Moggy.

2455
02:54:52,752 --> 02:54:54,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that, Catastrophic Moggy.

2456
02:54:56,776 --> 02:54:58,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of dickly.

2457
02:54:59,959 --> 02:55:02,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Moggy, but all the stuff.

2458
02:55:04,082 --> 02:55:05,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's not the interview.

2459
02:55:06,224 --> 02:55:07,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm reading over your shoulder here.

2460
02:55:07,966 --> 02:55:08,907
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this is the interview.

2461
02:55:10,928 --> 02:55:12,149
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pretty long one, but...

2462
02:55:14,075 --> 02:55:18,838
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the questions, are you confident in your approach and the inevitable build-up to November's launch hype?

2463
02:55:19,379 --> 02:55:27,864
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, without being too arrogant, I don't think we worry too much about building up the hype in the first six months because when the rubber hits the road is going to be when all those hardcore gamers have bought PS3s.

2464
02:55:29,185 --> 02:55:32,707
[SPEAKER_07]: They have also bought Xbox 360s and they probably bought Nintendo Wii as well.

2465
02:55:33,208 --> 02:55:36,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you know... There's a lot that haven't, though.

2466
02:55:37,030 --> 02:55:40,152
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that only adopt one of those systems, you know?

2467
02:55:40,512 --> 02:55:40,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2468
02:55:40,772 --> 02:55:41,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2469
02:55:43,186 --> 02:55:45,650
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy says a lot of very interesting things, that's for sure.

2470
02:55:46,551 --> 02:55:47,873
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's going to do it for email tonight.

2471
02:55:47,893 --> 02:55:51,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

2472
02:55:52,359 --> 02:55:58,027
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, I believe it's time to get the ranting on in a segment we call the FUs of the Week.

2473
02:55:58,128 --> 02:55:59,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the FUs of the Week right now.

2474
02:56:15,534 --> 02:56:17,536
[SPEAKER_07]: An F you to the bee sting I got on my neck.

2475
02:56:18,937 --> 02:56:21,499
[SPEAKER_07]: And the stinger didn't break the skin.

2476
02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:25,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it broke the skin, but not like it didn't get stuck in there.

2477
02:56:26,543 --> 02:56:27,824
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is enough.

2478
02:56:28,004 --> 02:56:29,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm allergic to bees.

2479
02:56:30,006 --> 02:56:33,069
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's enough that it's pretty bad.

2480
02:56:33,769 --> 02:56:42,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I also got another, I got a scrape from the stinger on my leg from a dead bee in the pool, and that thankfully didn't swell up, but I got another one and I have no idea when I got it.

2481
02:56:42,478 --> 02:56:47,824
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just, I felt it and that was it.

2482
02:56:47,884 --> 02:56:48,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Loki.

2483
02:56:50,126 --> 02:56:55,072
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to, I guess, live up green so far away.

2484
02:56:56,798 --> 02:56:58,439
[SPEAKER_02]: and my F.U.

2485
02:56:58,479 --> 02:57:00,921
[SPEAKER_02]: goes to a couple things tonight F.U.

2486
02:57:00,941 --> 02:57:08,566
[SPEAKER_02]: to Johnny Rockets because I went there to eat the other day and it took like 25 minutes to get our food and I wasn't even busy and also F.U.

2487
02:57:08,606 --> 02:57:20,814
[SPEAKER_02]: to them because once the food finally did fucking come the burgers I had were fucking delicious there were sliders, that's why I said burgers I'm not that fat those sliders are fucking good the orange dreamsicle shake

2488
02:57:23,255 --> 02:57:29,118
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I don't... Like, I'm actually trying to lose weight right now, so Johnny, I had to cut back on something.

2489
02:57:29,138 --> 02:57:31,979
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, you should not cut back on the Orange Dream School shake.

2490
02:57:32,039 --> 02:57:33,380
[SPEAKER_04]: That is delicious.

2491
02:57:33,740 --> 02:57:35,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I, uh, yeah, so F you.

2492
02:57:35,440 --> 02:57:38,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and F you to the fact that they derailed my diet because that food is so delicious.

2493
02:57:38,342 --> 02:57:43,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you, well, I don't know which Johnny Rockets you went to, but they have one... The one at Arden, I'll say Arden Fair Mall.

2494
02:57:43,304 --> 02:57:43,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Arden?

2495
02:57:43,964 --> 02:57:46,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they have a new one now that's across from the new Palladio Theaters.

2496
02:57:46,966 --> 02:57:47,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

2497
02:57:47,386 --> 02:57:48,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's pretty awesome.

2498
02:57:49,026 --> 02:57:49,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2499
02:57:51,228 --> 02:57:56,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet they didn't take... Well, see, if the place was packed and busy, then I would understand why it would take so long.

2500
02:57:56,191 --> 02:57:56,691
[SPEAKER_02]: It was empty.

2501
02:57:56,711 --> 02:57:57,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.

2502
02:57:57,412 --> 02:57:58,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, if you did that.

2503
02:57:59,233 --> 02:58:03,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you did those burgers being delicious and making me want to go through that torture again just to have them and screw up my diet.

2504
02:58:04,256 --> 02:58:05,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lost 10 pounds in three months.

2505
02:58:05,637 --> 02:58:05,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost.

2506
02:58:06,097 --> 02:58:07,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine pounds in three months.

2507
02:58:07,759 --> 02:58:09,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a bicycle and go riding with me.

2508
02:58:11,107 --> 02:58:13,629
[SPEAKER_02]: We live too far apart to do that every day, especially this time of year.

2509
02:58:14,830 --> 02:58:15,070
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2510
02:58:15,610 --> 02:58:16,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, oh, the other FU.

2511
02:58:16,751 --> 02:58:17,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one more FU.

2512
02:58:17,732 --> 02:58:23,556
[SPEAKER_02]: And then FU goes to Salacious Pop, not only for eliminating Pennywise from the list, but we went to the casino last night.

2513
02:58:23,716 --> 02:58:24,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost $20.

2514
02:58:25,477 --> 02:58:30,480
[SPEAKER_02]: This bitch puts like $5 in the slot machine and on his second pull wins $70.

2515
02:58:33,479 --> 02:58:34,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he buy you dinner?

2516
02:58:51,553 --> 02:58:52,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you stomp your little foot?

2517
02:58:53,613 --> 02:58:55,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't mad that he won.

2518
02:58:55,054 --> 02:58:56,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I was mad that I lost.

2519
02:58:56,114 --> 02:58:57,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And he won on his second bullet.

2520
02:58:57,494 --> 02:58:58,815
[SPEAKER_02]: You should see how fast I went through $20.

2521
02:58:58,875 --> 02:59:01,195
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just gone in a snap.

2522
02:59:01,235 --> 02:59:04,196
[SPEAKER_12]: And then he's like, oh, I think I'm winning all this money.

2523
02:59:04,336 --> 02:59:06,456
[SPEAKER_12]: The coin thing keeps going.

2524
02:59:06,536 --> 02:59:07,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I get to keep all this?

2525
02:59:10,157 --> 02:59:11,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you see why I don't like to gamble.

2526
02:59:12,878 --> 02:59:13,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I still love to gamble.

2527
02:59:13,758 --> 02:59:14,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even play a lottery.

2528
02:59:15,638 --> 02:59:16,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play the lottery.

2529
02:59:16,318 --> 02:59:16,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I love gambling.

2530
02:59:17,278 --> 02:59:18,699
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bad problem I have.

2531
02:59:19,139 --> 02:59:27,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's move on to a couple more news stories for you guys in the Skype line as well as the results of tonight's list list.

2532
02:59:28,320 --> 02:59:30,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do a couple more stories for you guys.

2533
02:59:30,461 --> 02:59:30,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

2534
02:59:32,621 --> 02:59:42,903
[SPEAKER_04]: You may remember a couple weeks back we talked a little bit about people that had games on the indie games store on the Xbox Marketplace.

2535
02:59:43,792 --> 02:59:52,876
[SPEAKER_04]: We're complaining that they just weren't getting enough exposure and the sales weren't very well, even for some of the top games on that service.

2536
02:59:53,396 --> 03:00:01,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of those companies, Z-Boy Games, they, of course, released Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of

2537
03:00:02,960 --> 03:00:05,381
[SPEAKER_04]: They now have put their games on Steam.

2538
03:00:06,142 --> 03:00:08,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're very pleased on how things are going.

2539
03:00:09,063 --> 03:00:19,109
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they're saying that Z-Boy Games has already made more revenue in less than a week on Steam than we have in over a year and a half on Xbox Indie Games.

2540
03:00:20,737 --> 03:00:21,698
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

2541
03:00:22,738 --> 03:00:25,960
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks for the indie games, but good for them that they're making money.

2542
03:00:28,002 --> 03:00:43,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically saying that they decided because of this that they're definitely looking at launching more games onto Steam versus the Xbox indie game service.

2543
03:00:44,712 --> 03:00:44,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

2544
03:00:47,864 --> 03:00:51,508
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you may remember they also took donation support.

2545
03:00:52,029 --> 03:00:54,932
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty big slap in the face to Xbox Live Indie Games.

2546
03:00:54,972 --> 03:00:59,937
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a pretty obvious showing of how Steam's doing it right and Xbox isn't doing it right when it comes to the indie games.

2547
03:00:59,998 --> 03:01:03,321
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be fair, there is a little bit of apples and oranges going on here because...

2548
03:01:04,122 --> 03:01:21,575
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Steam, that really was like their only new release that week Whereas with Xbox Live, you still have all the arcade games and all that stuff that they do have to promote But, I'm not going to say I totally disagree I think they should start featuring some indie games in the main banner once in a great while Especially these big ones that do very well

2549
03:01:21,937 --> 03:01:30,400
[SPEAKER_04]: If they would take the indie games and, like, say, have a certain release day for those and maybe a little bit more quality control with the stuff that's released.

2550
03:01:30,760 --> 03:01:47,507
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because I know with, like, WiiWare and stuff, you have, you know, blog sites and everything that lists, okay, here's the... And actually, Kotaku's been pretty good about... They don't know... I don't know if they do all the indie games that are released that week or if it's just the ones that they're playing or, like, you know, the...

2551
03:01:47,987 --> 03:01:49,368
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones that they think are kind of cool.

2552
03:01:49,728 --> 03:01:56,854
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll do a thread every week or so pointing those out and how much you can get them for and the links to download them and that kind of stuff.

2553
03:01:57,274 --> 03:02:03,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they should have something like that where the PlayStation Network comes out and says, hey, here's what's releasing on our service.

2554
03:02:04,660 --> 03:02:09,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily promoting them, but it's at least mentioning them so people are aware of them.

2555
03:02:10,525 --> 03:02:12,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, there's a lot of crap on there too, but...

2556
03:02:15,468 --> 03:02:23,952
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something wrong if they're making more money on Steam than they are in the indie game service in less than a week.

2557
03:02:26,193 --> 03:02:33,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you waste your time on indie games if you can just put your game on Steam and make that money in a week?

2558
03:02:34,815 --> 03:02:36,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's kind of scary.

2559
03:02:36,876 --> 03:02:43,538
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, if all... I mean, Xbox Live gets a lot of indie games, and these were obviously two of the quality ones.

2560
03:02:43,939 --> 03:02:48,240
[SPEAKER_02]: If everything that went out on Xbox Live went up on Steam, they wouldn't all sell as well.

2561
03:02:48,260 --> 03:02:49,181
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the difference.

2562
03:02:49,201 --> 03:02:59,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yes, they wouldn't all sell as well, but the ones that people are actually putting effort into and are considered hits on the indie game service aren't making that much money anyways.

2563
03:03:00,385 --> 03:03:01,426
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2564
03:03:21,984 --> 03:03:24,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, at Grasshopper, I'm creating sound, but not only sound.

2565
03:03:25,207 --> 03:03:31,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the leader of the development team, so I'm tag-teaming with Suda51, and I'm actually involved with game creation as well as sound.

2566
03:03:32,333 --> 03:03:36,277
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that there are a few titles they're going to announce soon, so stay tuned.

2567
03:03:37,378 --> 03:03:37,898
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

2568
03:03:38,979 --> 03:03:43,083
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I guess in this podcast, he also talked about how he almost quit Konami after his first week.

2569
03:03:44,204 --> 03:03:45,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Be interesting to see.

2570
03:03:45,625 --> 03:03:46,806
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.

2571
03:03:48,766 --> 03:03:50,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all for more Akira Yamaoka games.

2572
03:03:51,628 --> 03:03:54,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad he didn't, like, leave the industry altogether, that he's still making games.

2573
03:03:55,350 --> 03:03:56,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill just isn't the same without him.

2574
03:03:57,471 --> 03:03:59,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.

2575
03:03:59,452 --> 03:03:59,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2576
03:04:00,733 --> 03:04:01,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2577
03:04:01,774 --> 03:04:01,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2578
03:04:02,194 --> 03:04:03,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2579
03:04:03,174 --> 03:04:07,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, going to our chatroom at chat.orange.com, there is a little bit of a buffer, so they're still on the last story.

2580
03:04:07,177 --> 03:04:13,420
[SPEAKER_02]: SalaciousPop says, Steam Valve would probably say no to 90% of the shit that Xbox Live Indie Games has on their store, though.

2581
03:04:13,440 --> 03:04:13,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

2582
03:04:13,540 --> 03:04:14,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they should.

2583
03:04:15,851 --> 03:04:17,933
[SPEAKER_02]: See, who is it to determine quality?

2584
03:04:18,033 --> 03:04:21,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I would say there's some shit on Steam, too.

2585
03:04:22,055 --> 03:04:27,298
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing I do like about Steam is that they provide quick links to find reviews and so forth.

2586
03:04:27,778 --> 03:04:30,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And Metacritic, love it or hate it, their score is right there.

2587
03:04:31,420 --> 03:04:35,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they only show it if it's above a certain score, though, because it's not there for every game.

2588
03:04:35,943 --> 03:04:37,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But kind of interesting nonetheless.

2589
03:04:38,504 --> 03:04:43,368
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2590
03:04:43,408 --> 03:04:46,351
[SPEAKER_02]: The Skype line is open now for your calls if you want to give us a call.

2591
03:04:47,292 --> 03:04:49,414
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try to keep the calls probably a little brief tonight.

2592
03:04:49,434 --> 03:04:51,175
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running extraordinarily long tonight.

2593
03:04:51,215 --> 03:04:54,278
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already at a three-hour show and we haven't even gotten into calls yet.

2594
03:04:54,678 --> 03:04:56,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take those calls.

2595
03:04:57,061 --> 03:04:58,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2596
03:04:58,622 --> 03:04:59,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2597
03:05:00,704 --> 03:05:02,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if Loki has any last-minute stories.

2598
03:05:04,546 --> 03:05:04,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.

2599
03:05:06,627 --> 03:05:12,648
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a Tekken Bowl, I guess, was released this week for free on iOS, which is kind of lame.

2600
03:05:13,288 --> 03:05:15,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like bowling with Tekken characters?

2601
03:05:15,749 --> 03:05:17,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

2602
03:05:17,929 --> 03:05:18,129
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2603
03:05:18,149 --> 03:05:19,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right, right, right.

2604
03:05:19,809 --> 03:05:27,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, you're right, because they're going to be featuring that as well in the Tekken Tag HD or whatever that they're doing.

2605
03:05:28,391 --> 03:05:29,692
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you can download it for free.

2606
03:05:31,372 --> 03:05:31,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting it.

2607
03:05:33,352 --> 03:05:35,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, our phone's ringing, so let's go to it.

2608
03:05:35,174 --> 03:05:37,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on the phone, Orange Launch Radio.

2609
03:05:37,435 --> 03:05:37,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2610
03:05:38,396 --> 03:05:39,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's the one and only Ranma.

2611
03:05:40,057 --> 03:05:40,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

2612
03:05:40,638 --> 03:05:41,298
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Ranma?

2613
03:05:42,079 --> 03:05:44,040
[SPEAKER_08]: A whole lot of stuff, okay?

2614
03:05:44,060 --> 03:05:44,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stuff.

2615
03:05:46,142 --> 03:05:46,942
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of stuff?

2616
03:05:49,644 --> 03:05:50,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you too, Rob.

2617
03:05:50,705 --> 03:05:51,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you too.

2618
03:05:51,726 --> 03:05:51,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2619
03:05:52,687 --> 03:05:53,027
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

2620
03:05:53,988 --> 03:05:59,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, first off, yeah, I was stoned off my tookus last week.

2621
03:05:59,692 --> 03:06:00,993
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I ended up with a PlayStation 3.

2622
03:06:01,033 --> 03:06:02,134
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the first thing.

2623
03:06:06,042 --> 03:06:08,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, you were stoned and you bought a PlayStation 3?

2624
03:06:09,003 --> 03:06:12,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so stoned off my took that the decision to buy one was a good idea.

2625
03:06:13,103 --> 03:06:14,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I see, I see.

2626
03:06:14,744 --> 03:06:17,544
[SPEAKER_02]: So wait, you bought a PS3 when you were high and you regret it now?

2627
03:06:18,304 --> 03:06:18,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no.

2628
03:06:20,025 --> 03:06:23,125
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just an expensive blueberry player like everybody else says, but, you know.

2629
03:06:23,625 --> 03:06:24,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a few good games on it.

2630
03:06:25,646 --> 03:06:25,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

2631
03:06:27,026 --> 03:06:28,686
[SPEAKER_02]: LittleBigPlanet, I'm telling you.

2632
03:06:29,066 --> 03:06:32,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably one of the greatest games of this generation, period, on either console.

2633
03:06:34,104 --> 03:06:34,884
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the queue.

2634
03:06:35,164 --> 03:06:35,965
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the queue.

2635
03:06:36,085 --> 03:06:36,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, fair enough.

2636
03:06:37,505 --> 03:06:37,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2637
03:06:38,965 --> 03:06:44,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, about this whole Capcom debacle.

2638
03:06:44,847 --> 03:06:51,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm probably the only person that actually feels that Capcom was in the right to cancel the game.

2639
03:06:51,689 --> 03:06:55,630
[SPEAKER_08]: The only fuck up was how they handled the whole PR spin on the whole thing.

2640
03:06:56,684 --> 03:07:24,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't necessarily agree that it was right because I personally am a fan of Mega Man Legends but I am kind of trying to see it from their point of view and I do understand the business perspective if they don't make money then it's not worth our time but I do agree that their biggest faux pas was how they handled it yeah but defend yourself a little bit to the fanboys why do you you're not even saying like you're just flat out saying I agree with Capcom they should just cancel it why

2641
03:07:25,498 --> 03:07:33,842
[SPEAKER_08]: In this age of money's getting kind of tight, a lot of these companies, as much money as they're making, we don't know how much of that is revenue, profit, this or that.

2642
03:07:34,643 --> 03:07:41,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows, if they invest a lot of money making this game and it doesn't fit the bill, then they're out a lot of money.

2643
03:07:41,987 --> 03:07:43,767
[SPEAKER_08]: These companies really can't afford to do that.

2644
03:07:44,288 --> 03:07:46,029
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I find interesting is that

2645
03:07:46,869 --> 03:07:49,571
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not that many Mega Man Legends fans out there.

2646
03:07:49,871 --> 03:07:59,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, if you look at the online petition, there's so many fans, but most of them are just jumping on the bandwagon just because they need a common cause to fight over.

2647
03:07:59,838 --> 03:08:04,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I will admit, I wonder how many of those people would actually buy the game and how many are just wanting to pirate it.

2648
03:08:04,841 --> 03:08:07,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because I had the first Mega Man Legends game.

2649
03:08:07,703 --> 03:08:09,024
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to say it's crap.

2650
03:08:09,144 --> 03:08:10,765
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was a pretty good game.

2651
03:08:11,586 --> 03:08:14,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get the second one, you know, because it wasn't

2652
03:08:15,354 --> 03:08:19,856
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good concept, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.

2653
03:08:20,596 --> 03:08:24,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wish I could find the game again.

2654
03:08:24,118 --> 03:08:24,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to play it.

2655
03:08:25,058 --> 03:08:27,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it on PlayStation 3 download stuff?

2656
03:08:28,800 --> 03:08:29,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2657
03:08:29,240 --> 03:08:30,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it is.

2658
03:08:30,760 --> 03:08:31,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

2659
03:08:32,181 --> 03:08:33,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of surprised it wasn't.

2660
03:08:33,302 --> 03:08:35,482
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have drummed up more interest for a third one, but oh well.

2661
03:08:36,463 --> 03:08:39,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but that's how it goes.

2662
03:08:41,525 --> 03:08:47,269
[SPEAKER_02]: What about other stuff going on in Capcom's world, like the Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 news?

2663
03:08:47,289 --> 03:08:48,090
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about that?

2664
03:08:48,670 --> 03:08:50,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm amused that Phoenix Wright is in the game.

2665
03:08:51,592 --> 03:08:53,373
[SPEAKER_02]: That is kind of awesome, but is it $40 awesome?

2666
03:08:55,149 --> 03:08:58,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I tend to think so because I have to agree with what the Rob D said.

2667
03:08:58,652 --> 03:09:00,354
[SPEAKER_08]: They're rebalancing the characters.

2668
03:09:00,554 --> 03:09:04,618
[SPEAKER_08]: They're adding new stages and adding more features and functionality to make it worth the $40.

2669
03:09:05,439 --> 03:09:09,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they kind of did the same thing when they re-released Super Street Fighter 4.

2670
03:09:10,043 --> 03:09:14,827
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if they did the whole $59.99 price tag, I sure as hell would wait until it drops to $39.

2671
03:09:15,328 --> 03:09:16,008
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just me.

2672
03:09:16,669 --> 03:09:19,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, I think, the price point they're going to try and put it out at.

2673
03:09:20,633 --> 03:09:20,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

2674
03:09:24,073 --> 03:09:25,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry about that.

2675
03:09:25,294 --> 03:09:25,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I dropped my phone.

2676
03:09:25,974 --> 03:09:26,835
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't good.

2677
03:09:26,855 --> 03:09:29,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you have AppleCare on it.

2678
03:09:29,577 --> 03:09:30,177
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's fine.

2679
03:09:30,237 --> 03:09:31,538
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and I don't have AppleCare either.

2680
03:09:32,219 --> 03:09:35,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'd be just outside a year or two, so no, it's fine.

2681
03:09:35,281 --> 03:09:35,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.

2682
03:09:35,581 --> 03:09:35,921
[SPEAKER_08]: We're good.

2683
03:09:36,762 --> 03:09:37,022
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2684
03:09:37,422 --> 03:09:40,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, well, on that note, anything else on your mind tonight?

2685
03:09:41,205 --> 03:09:46,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Last thing, I don't know if you heard, but Sears is having this massive video game clearance sale at all of their stores.

2686
03:09:47,369 --> 03:09:49,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are they just unloading all the video games altogether?

2687
03:09:49,949 --> 03:09:54,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the thing is, your mileage may vary, because I've been hitting various stores.

2688
03:09:54,135 --> 03:10:00,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I do know right now, most of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band bundles are $20.

2689
03:10:01,906 --> 03:10:02,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice!

2690
03:10:02,286 --> 03:10:05,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Toys R Us did something like that a couple weeks ago, and I do kind of want a new Guitar Hero bundle.

2691
03:10:08,170 --> 03:10:09,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Including the big Super Bundles.

2692
03:10:09,951 --> 03:10:15,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to one Sears, and I picked up Guitar Hero Metallica for 96 cents, so I bought the last three.

2693
03:10:15,934 --> 03:10:16,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.

2694
03:10:17,255 --> 03:10:21,777
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, by the way, I don't know if you've got Big Lots out there?

2695
03:10:21,917 --> 03:10:24,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they opened one up by me somewhere.

2696
03:10:24,719 --> 03:10:26,140
[SPEAKER_08]: We mostly have amazing savings.

2697
03:10:26,525 --> 03:10:28,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan picked up DJ Hero for me, the bundle, for $20.

2698
03:10:28,786 --> 03:10:32,789
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a couple months ago, but they get them in.

2699
03:10:33,249 --> 03:10:37,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And we found a DDR there for $20 with a pad and everything.

2700
03:10:38,332 --> 03:10:38,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

2701
03:10:39,353 --> 03:10:48,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking about picking up the DJ Hero 2 bundle and sell the turntable and find somebody that wanted a turntable because I already have two, but nobody I know wants it.

2702
03:10:48,698 --> 03:10:53,121
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, there's no point in me buying it because I refuse to sell to...

2703
03:10:53,939 --> 03:10:55,120
[SPEAKER_08]: The Evil People, you know?

2704
03:10:55,441 --> 03:10:55,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

2705
03:10:56,522 --> 03:10:57,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm too lazy to put it on Craigslist.

2706
03:10:57,944 --> 03:11:00,106
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be kind of hard, too, if you don't have the game, you know what I mean?

2707
03:11:00,827 --> 03:11:02,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

2708
03:11:02,909 --> 03:11:03,650
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know how that rolls.

2709
03:11:04,371 --> 03:11:07,715
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks for calling.

2710
03:11:07,915 --> 03:11:08,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, no problem.

2711
03:11:08,716 --> 03:11:09,417
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, bye-bye.

2712
03:11:11,485 --> 03:11:12,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the phones.

2713
03:11:12,305 --> 03:11:13,526
[SPEAKER_02]: We got other calls coming in.

2714
03:11:13,546 --> 03:11:15,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go to pick up the phone again.

2715
03:11:15,567 --> 03:11:16,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2716
03:11:16,548 --> 03:11:16,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2717
03:11:17,488 --> 03:11:18,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, guys?

2718
03:11:18,108 --> 03:11:18,789
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Kai Judo.

2719
03:11:18,909 --> 03:11:19,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Kai Judo.

2720
03:11:19,589 --> 03:11:20,229
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2721
03:11:20,910 --> 03:11:21,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

2722
03:11:21,230 --> 03:11:21,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make it quick.

2723
03:11:21,990 --> 03:11:25,852
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to add my two cents to the Capcom Marvel... What is it?

2724
03:11:25,952 --> 03:11:26,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvel 3 now?

2725
03:11:27,153 --> 03:11:29,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Ultimate, yes.

2726
03:11:30,242 --> 03:11:35,970
[SPEAKER_01]: My thing is, okay, so this new game is supposed to have more content than the original, right?

2727
03:11:36,290 --> 03:11:36,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

2728
03:11:37,252 --> 03:11:38,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And the original is $60, right?

2729
03:11:39,115 --> 03:11:39,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

2730
03:11:40,316 --> 03:11:42,479
[SPEAKER_01]: And this new version is going to be $40, right?

2731
03:11:42,940 --> 03:11:43,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2732
03:11:43,801 --> 03:11:45,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not make all of those fucking fighting games $40?

2733
03:11:47,608 --> 03:11:48,669
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.

2734
03:11:48,749 --> 03:11:50,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not make all the fucking fighting games $40?

2735
03:11:50,950 --> 03:11:52,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this though.

2736
03:11:52,151 --> 03:11:59,176
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was at the place that I will not talk about anymore, I did see that they had dropped the price of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 to $40.

2737
03:12:00,057 --> 03:12:02,939
[SPEAKER_02]: But that certainly wasn't its price new originally.

2738
03:12:04,292 --> 03:12:08,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that, to me, when I think fighting game, I always think retro.

2739
03:12:08,894 --> 03:12:11,995
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always think that those games should be low price.

2740
03:12:12,035 --> 03:12:15,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I never understood the $60 for Street Fighter.

2741
03:12:15,996 --> 03:12:18,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I waited for the second version of Street Fighter.

2742
03:12:19,057 --> 03:12:20,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dropped down to $30.

2743
03:12:20,838 --> 03:12:21,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, has it?

2744
03:12:21,438 --> 03:12:24,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, then the place that shouldn't be named is just overcharging now.

2745
03:12:24,139 --> 03:12:25,099
[SPEAKER_02]: What a surprise.

2746
03:12:25,379 --> 03:12:26,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It was recent.

2747
03:12:26,519 --> 03:12:28,080
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Thursday, Friday.

2748
03:12:28,351 --> 03:12:29,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember dropping $70 on that game.

2749
03:12:44,471 --> 03:12:46,133
[SPEAKER_07]: I've spent $65 on Killer Instinct.

2750
03:12:46,233 --> 03:12:54,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Super Nintendo games were expensive, and that was $70 a few years ago, which, you know, inflation and all that means it was probably more like $100 you paid for that game.

2751
03:12:55,485 --> 03:12:58,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't always say that fighting games have always been cheap.

2752
03:12:59,870 --> 03:13:01,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, that's for sure.

2753
03:13:01,272 --> 03:13:03,194
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, now I think they're kind of...

2754
03:13:04,156 --> 03:13:04,637
[SPEAKER_01]: But seriously?

2755
03:13:19,309 --> 03:13:19,770
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2756
03:13:42,813 --> 03:13:43,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, no problem.

2757
03:13:43,774 --> 03:13:44,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, any other thoughts?

2758
03:13:45,415 --> 03:13:47,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you guys need to get on Minecraft.

2759
03:13:48,157 --> 03:13:48,917
[SPEAKER_01]: The pay version.

2760
03:13:49,058 --> 03:13:49,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it.

2761
03:13:49,778 --> 03:13:50,879
[SPEAKER_12]: I really do not like Minecraft.

2762
03:13:50,999 --> 03:13:52,080
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, I tried.

2763
03:13:52,140 --> 03:13:52,480
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried.

2764
03:13:52,500 --> 03:13:53,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, at least it was the free version.

2765
03:13:53,721 --> 03:13:57,984
[SPEAKER_01]: But even Terraria... No, the free... I didn't mean to cut you off.

2766
03:13:58,004 --> 03:14:00,906
[SPEAKER_01]: But the free version is totally different from the pay version.

2767
03:14:00,946 --> 03:14:01,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.

2768
03:14:01,607 --> 03:14:04,309
[SPEAKER_01]: The pay version... We'll see.

2769
03:14:04,389 --> 03:14:07,531
[SPEAKER_02]: If I run out of the other games that I have, maybe I'll check it out.

2770
03:14:07,751 --> 03:14:10,153
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've tried playing Terraria this week.

2771
03:14:10,731 --> 03:14:14,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay, but I was like, oh wow, this really is just Minecraft.

2772
03:14:14,955 --> 03:14:16,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I kind of hit that too.

2773
03:14:16,537 --> 03:14:19,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I did play some in Minecraft.

2774
03:14:20,140 --> 03:14:22,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Although Dan did show me something interesting today.

2775
03:14:22,442 --> 03:14:26,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone created the whole Middle Earth pretty much in Minecraft.

2776
03:14:27,247 --> 03:14:31,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Including underground places and the whole dwarven areas and whatnot.

2777
03:14:31,291 --> 03:14:31,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2778
03:14:31,451 --> 03:14:32,351
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2779
03:14:55,199 --> 03:14:56,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go ahead and close up Skype, I think, tonight.

2780
03:14:57,001 --> 03:14:58,342
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry to those of you that didn't get through.

2781
03:14:58,382 --> 03:15:01,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry it was a shorter segment than usual, but we're running really long tonight, so sorry about that.

2782
03:15:02,605 --> 03:15:05,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go ahead and wrap up the last-minute story so we can wrap up the show.

2783
03:15:05,848 --> 03:15:06,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Loki?

2784
03:15:07,330 --> 03:15:07,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I got nothing.

2785
03:15:08,651 --> 03:15:08,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2786
03:15:09,271 --> 03:15:09,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all right, then.

2787
03:15:09,792 --> 03:15:10,532
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, anything?

2788
03:15:11,633 --> 03:15:15,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, SalaciousPop brought up that Capcom published Street Fighter Alpha 2 for the SNES.

2789
03:15:16,798 --> 03:15:19,000
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really sucky, and it had loading time.

2790
03:15:19,907 --> 03:15:21,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, it was like a Super Nintendo cartridge.

2791
03:15:21,609 --> 03:15:22,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I own it.

2792
03:15:22,689 --> 03:15:23,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I own it.

2793
03:15:23,410 --> 03:15:23,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

2794
03:15:23,970 --> 03:15:25,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2795
03:15:26,613 --> 03:15:27,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And no, I'm not going to pay for Minecraft.

2796
03:15:29,457 --> 03:15:57,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know I might when I run out of other games to play I'll kind of get to that but I still have so many games I gotta beat and then Minecraft seems like one of those time sinks you spend a lot of time but I gotta admit I would like to explore I like exploring worlds especially recreations of stuff so like if there's ways to go in and explore that middle earth stuff that might be kind of fun actually that'd be kind of cool alright well let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can close up shop for tonight so Loki what's your final thought tonight?

2797
03:15:58,791 --> 03:16:26,681
[SPEAKER_04]: my final thought is I can't wait till Tuesday god I hope he brought better fucking bring Saints Row 3rd I'm very disappointed otherwise cause we got like a bunch of people coming in I know that we're Ubisoft will probably bring Just Dance 3 cause they brought Just Dance 2 last year THQ last year brought Smackdown vs. Raw 11 but I think if they're bringing the biggest game it's gonna be Saints Row 3rd

2798
03:16:27,621 --> 03:16:57,090
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course Microsoft will be there this year which is kind of cool and I know LucasArts is going to be bringing the Star Wars Kinect game so lots of stuff to play well then good I want to hear your rundowns on it next week so my final thought is this show ran long and it's getting late I'm getting hungry so it's time to go DarkSakura your final thought tonight I just texted Dan that I have hungers and he needs to bring me my burger you want a taco or no you want a burger

2799
03:16:57,750 --> 03:16:58,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's bringing me a burger.

2800
03:16:58,852 --> 03:17:00,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to pay for a burger.

2801
03:17:01,117 --> 03:17:03,022
[SPEAKER_07]: How about a taco burger?

2802
03:17:03,062 --> 03:17:03,884

[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do that real quick.

2815
03:18:09,396 --> 03:18:19,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And just a note to myself, when I'm scripting next week's show, if I'm going to put a listless on, I should also put, at the end, listless results, and then that way I won't forget it.

2816
03:18:19,784 --> 03:18:24,748
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys did vote tonight's listless, and it was kind of close, but not really.
