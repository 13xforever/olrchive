00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:23,033
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, June 8th, 2011 We bring you further impressions and opinions on E3 Live with special correspondents Bobby Blackwolf and Miklatov on the show floor

2
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:39,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to night number two of E3 live coverage here at Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:51,721
[SPEAKER_06]: In conjunction with Ustream, our little temporary home for the shows, and, of course, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf, who does his own show on Sunday nights and is also syndicating the show to his feed as well as our feed, so it's just...

4
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:54,003
[SPEAKER_06]: All out there for everybody.

5
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:55,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm glad you guys are enjoying it.

6
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:56,906
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:56,946 --> 00:01:02,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be joining you over the next hour, hour and a half, however long we go tonight with my co-hosts here in the studio.

8
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura.

9
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:05,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Carrot.

10
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:08,756
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've gone from meat last night to carrot tonight.

11
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because I want something crunchy.

12
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:32,164
[SPEAKER_06]: We are live, of course, live on Ustream.

13
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:36,627
[SPEAKER_06]: If this is your first time listening to us here on Ustream, this is not where we're usually at.

14
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:39,790
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a Sunday night live show every week at All Games Radio.

15
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,475
[SPEAKER_06]: More information about our podcast and all that good stuff, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

16
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:50,739
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can listen to last night's two and a half hour opus of the Wii U. Wii U, Wii U.

17
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,963
[SPEAKER_06]: and Xbox and Kinect and the Vita.

18
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:57,285
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to actually get more into the Vita tonight.

19
00:01:58,365 --> 00:01:59,386
[SPEAKER_06]: It is live, of course.

20
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:07,753
[SPEAKER_06]: You can join us in our chat room at chat.orangeloungerated.com if you have any live comments you want to give us as we're broadcasting here live.

21
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:13,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of live, sometimes interesting things happen and we actually have to mix things up a little bit tonight.

22
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,660
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to start with Bobby tonight.

23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby's caught in traffic.

24
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,202
[SPEAKER_06]: He's still...

25
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:19,363
[SPEAKER_06]: in LA downtown.

26
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:22,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the last text I got is that a Transformer blew out somewhere.

27
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:23,804
[SPEAKER_06]: So sorry, Bobby fans.

28
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:26,105
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to go to him a little later.

29
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,106
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to go right into today's coverage of E3.

30
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:34,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And from what I understand, our correspondents out on the floor got some more hands-on impressions today.

31
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:43,550
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, yesterday, Bobby waited for quite a while in that Wii U, Wii U, Wii U line to about, what, like four hours to finally get his hands on the Wii U and gave us his impressions yesterday.

32
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:44,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

33
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:46,272
[SPEAKER_06]: PS Vita

34
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:00,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Very sad, in my soul

35
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:26,193
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, it's just his opinion.

36
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:27,313
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just one opinion.

37
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:28,594
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

38
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:29,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Bobby got to play it today.

39
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:30,975
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if he thought the same thing.

40
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:34,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

41
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, is this Miklatov?

42
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:36,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

43
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:39,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio, of course.

44
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,559
[SPEAKER_06]: You should know that.

45
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I just texted you.

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,221
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so surprising.

48
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:43,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

49
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:47,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for letting us mix things up a little bit and bringing you on first tonight.

50
00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:48,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby's caught in traffic.

51
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:49,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are you?

52
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:50,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you back at your hotel?

53
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:52,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I made it back.

54
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:53,734
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

55
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:55,515
[SPEAKER_07]: After 50 minutes of commuting.

56
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,856
[SPEAKER_06]: How was E3 for you today?

57
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:30,880
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, well, I would say I only really participated in E3 today for about three hours, if that, because today was my stand in line day.

58
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:42,493
[SPEAKER_06]: It took about 4 hours for me to get through that line and I got there at about 10.30 so it was a bit ridiculous for the line but to make up for it

59
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,394
[SPEAKER_07]: if you can consider it that.

60
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:08,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I did play with it for about 20 minutes.

61
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:11,156
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got some good hands-on time with it.

62
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:11,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Not bad.

63
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And what are your thoughts?

64
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:16,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like it.

65
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:20,919
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely a great successor to the PSP.

66
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:25,641
[SPEAKER_07]: For the design part of the system, the screen is beautiful.

67
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:27,021
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really big.

68
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:28,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really vibrant.

69
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:31,223
[SPEAKER_07]: You really don't see any pixels whatsoever.

70
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,604
[SPEAKER_07]: It's playing a nice high-def screen.

71
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:43,311
[SPEAKER_07]: The back part with the touchpad, I don't like that so much because the touchpad takes up too much of the back.

72
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:51,958
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're constantly accidentally tapping it and in the game that you use the touchpad on the back can kind of screw you up.

73
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:56,082
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's just a minor complaint.

74
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:59,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure if I held it the right way because there's grips it would be a little bit better.

75
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:01,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if you could just turn that crap off.

76
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:04,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think you could just turn off that back touchpad altogether?

77
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:05,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I didn't even think about that.

78
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:11,142
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, if you have a tendency to tap on the back of your device or something, it's going to totally mess with that back touch stuff, right?

79
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:13,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it will.

80
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:16,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I assume that some games will have that.

81
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it will be a system setting.

82
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:28,711
[SPEAKER_07]: The one thing that I actually do not like about the system is that the face buttons are way too small.

83
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:38,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I was playing Uncharted and I kept trying to hit the X button, but instead I'd hit an analog stick because that's where my fingers felt like the X button should be.

84
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:42,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of these really tiny little buttons that they give you to play with.

85
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:44,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not ask and they did not say.

86
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:44,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume...

87
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,707
[SPEAKER_07]: because of how close to, I mean, really, if you think about if it's supposed to be this holiday, it's only a few months out.

88
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:06,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm pretty sure that this is probably the final design.

89
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:07,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

90
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:31,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

91
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:34,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so this isn't about the DS, though.

92
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:35,036
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about the PS Vita.

93
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:37,718
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell us about some of the games that you played and what they were like.

94
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, they had a station set up for us to go to, and we got five minutes on each.

95
00:07:43,782 --> 00:07:44,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it four?

96
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:44,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

97
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:47,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the amount of stations, but I'll list them off.

98
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:51,828
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one we went to was the LittleBigPlanet station.

99
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:57,792
[SPEAKER_07]: So you got to play, or you got your choice of a couple different options in LittleBigPlanet.

100
00:07:57,872 --> 00:07:59,313
[SPEAKER_07]: You could play a stage, or you could play a game.

101
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,481
[SPEAKER_07]: or you could play a two-player game using just the touchscreen and you would play with the demo guy.

102
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:11,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I opted to do just the stage because I wanted to see how it would really work in the practical play.

103
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:13,586
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was really impressed.

104
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:25,373
[SPEAKER_07]: It used everything from the touchpad to tilting the system, or not touchpad, sorry, the touchscreen to tilting the system and it played like LittleBigPlanet and it looked like LittleBigPlanet on the PS3.

105
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:27,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was really impressed.

106
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,516
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the puzzles that it had me do was

107
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:38,902
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a keyboard in the background and I had to push the keys for the musical note and then LBP and it would open the door.

108
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:40,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was really cool.

109
00:08:40,643 --> 00:08:45,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say it felt more like a separate experience because the Vita special features really made it feel that way.

110
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:18,474
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was a part where I had to hold on to one of the little spinning wheels, and it wasn't spinning yet.

111
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:31,040
[SPEAKER_07]: So while I was holding it with the R trigger, or whatever it's called, the R button, I had to use my left hand to actually spin the wheel around so he would go up to the top.

112
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, that doesn't...

113
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:33,414
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is cool.

114
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:34,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Not something I would expect.

115
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:35,375
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, these are really small.

116
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:36,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, my hands are not big at all, and

117
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:55,880
[SPEAKER_07]: These, I swear, were like the size of mini M&Ms.

118
00:09:57,141 --> 00:09:58,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Something people might know.

119
00:09:58,942 --> 00:09:59,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there you go.

120
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,024
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good comparison.

121
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:03,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so what else?

122
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:14,233
[SPEAKER_07]: LittleBigPlanet and... Okay, after that, they sent us over to Virtua Tennis, which, so far, these two games, I was told, are launch titles for the system.

123
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,775
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Virtua Tennis, really nice-looking...

124
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:22,957
[SPEAKER_07]: They had you play it first with just touch screen.

125
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,979
[SPEAKER_07]: So you would press the spot on the court to move your guy.

126
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,660
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd hold your finger down and your guy would move.

127
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you could flick up to do a top spin and then flick down to do a back spin.

128
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,864
[SPEAKER_07]: And it actually worked really well.

129
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:37,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I was introduced to control.

130
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:38,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

131
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:42,368
[SPEAKER_06]: How is that touch screen stuff different from like playing an iPhone game?

132
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is that really what it felt like?

133
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:44,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, I'm playing an iPhone game.

134
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:45,730
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really what it felt like.

135
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,470
[SPEAKER_06]: With nice graphics?

136
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,090
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nicer.

137
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:47,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

138
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:48,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

139
00:10:48,863 --> 00:10:49,923
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was on a bigger screen.

140
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:52,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

141
00:10:53,445 --> 00:11:00,688
[SPEAKER_07]: So then he told me to do all my hits with the touchscreen and I could move with the analog stick.

142
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, okay, I kind of like the way that one played.

143
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:07,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it was like, oh, just play normally.

144
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,372
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't super impressive, but it was still really fun because retro test games are pretty fun.

145
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:16,714
[SPEAKER_07]: So after my time was up there,

146
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:21,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to the, what's that super game called?

147
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Little Deviants.

148
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:30,647
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is pretty much what I feel like they're trying to one-up Nintendo with.

149
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:35,090
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to be a collection of mini-games, for the most part.

150
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,812
[SPEAKER_07]: There were three that we got to play.

151
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:45,798
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one was an AR game, just like Face Raiders, to a T, with the exception of putting somebody's face in it.

152
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:56,335
[SPEAKER_07]: You just look around with your screen all over the actual environment for these little spaceships you had to destroy before they destroyed your little deviant characters.

153
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:03,878
[SPEAKER_07]: The next one was a whack-a-mole style game that used both the touchscreen and the touchpad on the back.

154
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:13,961
[SPEAKER_07]: So windows would open up and if they were facing you, you had to touch the touchscreen on them and if they were back turned to you, you had to press from behind underneath.

155
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:18,225
[SPEAKER_07]: and watch out for the humans because you lost points for that.

156
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:21,928
[SPEAKER_06]: These all definitely sound like little gimmicky demos.

157
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:28,132
[SPEAKER_06]: To be fair, it's probably the same stuff they're demoing the Wii U with right now.

158
00:12:29,654 --> 00:12:30,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

159
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:43,424
[SPEAKER_07]: The last one was the one that probably everybody's seen where you have the touchpad on the back and you make the hills and you roll the ball, the BBM ball guy around into the whirlpool.

160
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:44,245
[SPEAKER_07]: That one

161
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:57,358
[SPEAKER_07]: was probably what really frustrated me most with the touchpad on the back just because, I mean, it feels inevitable that you will rest your fingers on the back of the pad the way they don't want you to do it.

162
00:12:58,538 --> 00:13:03,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was no clear definition on the back where the touchpad started and where it ended.

163
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So that one was really hard for me.

164
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:09,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So Little Deviants, though, it sounds like it's just a minigame collection.

165
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:10,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

166
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:11,443
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, it kind of sounds like a pass.

167
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:12,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen it before.

168
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:12,784
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think?

169
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:17,220
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a purchase for me at all.

170
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:19,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It was bundled in with the system.

171
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:23,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to delete it, but I'm not going to purchase it.

172
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:30,291
[SPEAKER_07]: The next one I went to was Sound... What did I call it?

173
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:32,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Sound... Something or other.

174
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:34,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Sound... Sound something.

175
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:36,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it a music game?

176
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:38,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it kind of was.

177
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:39,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

178
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:43,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, now I feel bad because I was talking about how much I love that game.

179
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Sound Shapes.

180
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at your text from earlier.

181
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:46,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Sound Shapes.

182
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:48,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

183
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:49,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Sound Shapes.

184
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:53,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is interesting because this was not even something that we saw at the press conference.

185
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you texted me that, I'm like, what the hell is that?

186
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:57,770
[SPEAKER_06]: That must be a game they didn't say anything about otherwise.

187
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been talked about before.

188
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:01,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that.

189
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:03,955
[SPEAKER_07]: It's made by the guy that did...

190
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:08,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say either PixelJunk or Everyday Shooter.

191
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:09,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

192
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:10,118
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those two.

193
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:13,541
[SPEAKER_07]: But in it, it's got two modes.

194
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,983
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a platforming mode, which is very simplistic shapes.

195
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:22,949
[SPEAKER_07]: You're this little blue spiky ball looking thing.

196
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:27,332
[SPEAKER_07]: But the object is to get through the level and to hit these blue orbs.

197
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:30,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And every time you hit a blue orb in that screen, it creates

198
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the drums for the music, or it creates the guitar, or the keyboard.

199
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So you keep going through it.

200
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:37,945
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, yeah, so...

201
00:14:55,686 --> 00:15:00,588
[SPEAKER_07]: You go through different screens trying to collect all the blue orbs to create the music.

202
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:07,571
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very much a music-y platformer that caught my attention right away.

203
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:16,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I was told, again, launch title, and that people would be able to create their own stages and upload them for other people to play.

204
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:21,378
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the other part of the demo.

205
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:24,399
[SPEAKER_07]: He was showing me how to create my own stage and placing...

206
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:29,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Music at certain points and placing the orbs and traps and it was really cool.

207
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:30,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked it a lot.

208
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:31,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

209
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:49,081
[SPEAKER_06]: As a music game fan, this is kind of a must-have for you because I'm looking at this going, this does not look at all like other music games, but I'm glad because I think it's, you know, I don't always need to see falling notes that you hit whatever device to, you know, so this is kind of nice.

210
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:58,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it's not only a game for music fans, but also for possibly platforming fans.

211
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,839
[SPEAKER_06]: People who like to get high and play video games.

212
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:02,041
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?

213
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:04,063
[SPEAKER_06]: People who like to get high and play video games.

214
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:11,170
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because they'll probably try to eat their PSV or drop it thinking it's some crazy monster.

215
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,813
[SPEAKER_04]: We need new cracks since Mojibribbin's already out.

216
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

217
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:22,409
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of like, it's simplistic like that, like Vibra and stuff.

218
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,151
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it was great.

219
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:29,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely going to be the first game I buy because it was the one that impressed me the most.

220
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:33,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Which makes me sad because the next demo I went to was Uncharted.

221
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:40,565
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the game that at first announcement had sold me on the Vita before it was called that and before I had played it.

222
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:43,548
[SPEAKER_07]: And it didn't disappoint me per se.

223
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:47,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it looked beautiful and played like Uncharted.

224
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:55,057
[SPEAKER_07]: My problem with it is those tiny little M&M buttons that they just got in my way.

225
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:57,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't perform moves as well.

226
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:06,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely got shot and killed twice during our demo because I couldn't get the button properly.

227
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:10,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you try any of the touchscreen controls?

228
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:11,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that?

229
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:14,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely thought it was stupid.

230
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:20,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have to, instead of like, you know, position myself with the camera and my body for the next enemy...

231
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:49,993
[SPEAKER_07]: After I'm done punching this guy to death, it takes one hand off of that and I have to focus on tapping the little fist icon, which was stupid.

232
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:56,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you would like that because when I was seeing that in the trailer, I was like, that looks like Elite Beat Agents and that's like Milita's favorite game.

233
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,057
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, it's nothing like that at all.

234
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:03,178
[SPEAKER_07]: It was frustrating and kind of annoying.

235
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:07,280
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm sure that that will not be the only way to play.

236
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:19,042
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I probably used the little M&M buttons to hit too, but the demo, I didn't get a chance to try that because like, oh, use the touchscreen only for combat.

237
00:18:19,062 --> 00:18:22,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, okay, thanks for getting me killed.

238
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:29,726
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that ended the PS Vita experience.

239
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:31,247
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was worth the four-hour wait?

240
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:33,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I think so.

241
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:37,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think I have waited in long lines at E3 before.

242
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:40,818
[SPEAKER_07]: and not come away as satisfied as I did with the Vita.

243
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:46,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think the little buttons will hold me back from purchasing one because I think a lot of that has to do with

244
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:13,552
[SPEAKER_07]: My hands being more accustomed to holding a PSP, so my fingers gravitate to where I think it's going to be at.

245
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:16,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be honest, it looks just like a PSP.

246
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:22,257
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit longer, a little bit wider, and a lot lighter actually.

247
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:24,859
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like nothing in your hands whatsoever.

248
00:19:26,522 --> 00:19:27,383
[SPEAKER_06]: PSP, BackTouch, FrontTouch, Power

249
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:51,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't say slightly more power, I'd say a lot more power Yes

250
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:11,884
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't like, when you see the screen in person, that's what got my attention first.

251
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:18,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the weight in my hands got it second, and then it's just a really nicely designed system for once.

252
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:23,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I kind of asked Bobby about this yesterday because he waited in line for the Wii U most of the day.

253
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,120
[SPEAKER_06]: You waited in line for the PS Vita most of the day.

254
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you catch any kind of like buzz from people around you?

255
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:34,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, see, the funny thing was Bobby was standing around a bunch of people who didn't speak English yesterday, so there was like no one for him to listen to.

256
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:37,282
[SPEAKER_06]: But did you kind of catch what was the buzz?

257
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:38,922
[SPEAKER_06]: What were other people saying about the Vita?

258
00:20:39,242 --> 00:20:41,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Were people complaining about the controller like you were or –

259
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:43,391
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a

260
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:26,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So it wasn't like some random person, but they were talking to one of the Naughty Dog people that were over there, and they said that Skyrim is going to have about 30 hours of main quests and 300 hours of side quests.

261
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:27,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

262
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:27,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

263
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:56,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so the PS Vita took up most of your day, but you were happy with it at the end of the day.

264
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:58,016
[SPEAKER_06]: What else were you able to get your hands on today?

265
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:06,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to play Child of Eden, which was definitely not totally what I was expecting, but I still really liked it.

266
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:17,441
[SPEAKER_07]: The control scheme's a little weird, and it was a guy, the guy that was explaining to me, A, wasn't from Ubisoft, B, was from Walmart, and C...

267
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:22,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at me again and realize the amount of knowledge you probably had about the game.

268
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,051
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't really tell me how to play properly, I don't think.

269
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:32,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was hard to just jump in randomly and start playing.

270
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,796
[SPEAKER_07]: But it felt a lot like Rez.

271
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:35,656
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked like Rez.

272
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:36,997
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounded like Rez.

273
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:42,220
[SPEAKER_07]: But the two firing mechanisms are different.

274
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:48,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Like your left hand is like a rapid fire gun that only works on these pinkish enemies.

275
00:22:49,109 --> 00:23:01,514
[SPEAKER_07]: and your right hand is your lock-on gun and I couldn't tell if I was supposed to lock on fully and then fling my hand forward to shoot or if it was just automatically shot.

276
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:08,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I had to fling my hand forward but I definitely was getting hit a whole lot in that game but it was on no die so it didn't matter.

277
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:10,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And the music was really good, I imagine?

278
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:16,220
[SPEAKER_07]: What little I could hear, yeah, because this one was outside underneath the tent

279
00:23:17,101 --> 00:23:23,986
[SPEAKER_07]: which is of course the optimal playing environment for a music game and a Kinect game.

280
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:31,030
[SPEAKER_06]: They must have been at that booth where I think Rock of the Dead was shown last year and it was not a great location.

281
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,331
[SPEAKER_07]: You know where that booth was?

282
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:38,795
[SPEAKER_07]: That booth was where a long time ago I think you were there for the T3 where they had the Bald's tent set up.

283
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:42,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even think I remember that, but that's alright.

284
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:57,473
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like not even on convention grounds, it's across the street Oh jeez, oh god, okay, you weren't even in the convention center at that point Yeah, that's when I was walking there this morning and they were like, hey, do you want to come play some games?

285
00:23:57,493 --> 00:24:08,260
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got Brink, and I was like, no, and they're like, and Trials of Eden, and I was like, yep, let's go over there Because I still haven't found it on the show floor, and I've been looking It's probably not there because it's out, like what, next week?

286
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,363
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think there's a lot more to say about it Alright, well, what else did you get your hands on?

287
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:21,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get my hands on it, but I did get to sit through the presentation for Saints Row the Third, and that was pretty funny.

288
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:35,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never liked open world games, and I don't like GTA or anything like that, so I just kind of went in with an open mind, and that game looks freaking hilarious, and they didn't censor the dildo bat thing that they hit people with.

289
00:24:35,295 --> 00:24:36,215
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really funny.

290
00:24:36,815 --> 00:24:39,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also said that you can make your character naked in play.

291
00:24:39,716 --> 00:24:40,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like,

292
00:24:40,862 --> 00:24:43,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to get an M rating at that point.

293
00:24:44,945 --> 00:24:47,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they're like built like a Barbie doll.

294
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:50,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Naked to them might mean like booty shorts.

295
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:53,612
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it might be like just nothing but, you know.

296
00:24:54,813 --> 00:24:58,495
[SPEAKER_07]: So my male character I'd make would have booty shorts.

297
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:00,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

298
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:01,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you just heard Dan, but L.A.

299
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:03,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Noire, I don't know if you've played that.

300
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:05,581
[SPEAKER_06]: That got an M rating and that's got full on beaver.

301
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:06,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.

302
00:25:06,341 --> 00:25:06,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.

303
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:11,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I haven't, I've got it, I haven't finished it yet, or even come close.

304
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:11,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoiler!

305
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:36,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess, yeah, I guess if it's not, like, in an actual fashion, it won't get anything bad, but, um, that was really funny, uh, I liked what I saw, they showed off some open world stuff, which was just humorous, and then, um, like, you can put people in a cannon that's on a car and shoot them out, and everybody loves you, because, uh, your game, the things are, like, like,

306
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:42,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Celebrity, so no matter what you do, they like you, so you put them in a can and you shoot them out at things and they die.

307
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:45,421
[SPEAKER_07]: People are all excited because they're meeting you.

308
00:25:47,122 --> 00:25:52,786
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be a totally obscure reference, but this reminds me of one of the movies that stars Divine.

309
00:25:52,846 --> 00:25:56,429
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know who Divine is, I think it's Female Trouble or something.

310
00:25:56,449 --> 00:26:01,813
[SPEAKER_06]: She's very filthy and over-the-top and stuff, and there's a scene where she's like, Who wants to die for art?

311
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:03,334
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody's like, Me, me, me.

312
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:04,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she shoots one of them.

313
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:07,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, but what you're describing sounds to me like that.

314
00:26:07,517 --> 00:26:11,200
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the over-the-top craziness is what they're going for in this game.

315
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've succeeded?

316
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:12,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

317
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:14,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.

318
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:23,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they showed a mission, which they were robbing a bank, and it turned out to be some rival gang's bank or whatever, so fighting ensued.

319
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:34,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And at one point during the gunfight, which was really gory, too, just some random person in a hoodie came up and asked for your autograph, and you get extra points if you sign it.

320
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:36,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, that's hilarious.

321
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:38,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

322
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:43,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So is this, even though you don't play the GTA-style games, it sounds like you might be interested in getting this one?

323
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I might try this one.

324
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,270
[SPEAKER_07]: This one looks really funny.

325
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:57,732
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, that's one thing about Grand Theft Auto is it takes itself pretty seriously, and I don't know, this just seems like, like, it kind of reminds me of, like, Smoke and Aces, that movie.

326
00:26:58,192 --> 00:26:58,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

327
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:01,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it Lucky Number 7?

328
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:01,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

329
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,694
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, Smoke and Aces, yeah, not Lucky Number 7.

330
00:27:03,814 --> 00:27:03,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

331
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:08,081
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's really all I got to play today, I think.

332
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:16,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm racking my brain, but the Vita took up so much time that I don't think there was much else for today.

333
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:21,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so anything you're going to try to look at tomorrow?

334
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:24,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know we're not doing a show tomorrow, but anything you might want to look at?

335
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:33,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I was debating on doing the Wii U or not, and I think my final decision is I'm not going to go to it because I don't think it's worth the time.

336
00:27:35,620 --> 00:28:02,226
[SPEAKER_07]: so I think tomorrow is going to be catch up day like I'm going to go try to do Uncharted 3 because you get like a t-shirt and some stuff for doing Uncharted 3 I'm going to go back through the 3DS lines because you get pins when you play the games and I want more pins because of swag and Rhythm Heaven is there for the Wii and I haven't got to play it yet and I really want to do that because I like Rhythm Heaven so I might just hang out in the Wii and Sony tomorrow and just completely avoid the other hall because

337
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:07,768
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, most of the cool stuff is either behind closed doors or just in video form.

338
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:18,791
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're kind of finding the usual E3 thing that seems to be more and more popular the last five years to be true where all the really good stuff is behind closed doors and there's very little out there on the floor for the rest of you?

339
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:20,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

340
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:21,512
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad.

341
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:27,074
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't understand the media restrictions this year because it doesn't look like it really changed anything.

342
00:28:27,614 --> 00:28:30,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt like if they did the restrictions it would probably mean

343
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:35,590
[SPEAKER_07]: more stuff on the floor, but it feels like there's less stuff on the floor.

344
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:39,913
[SPEAKER_07]: 2K and Activision all have their stuff behind closed doors.

345
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:42,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Bethesda has all their stuff behind closed doors.

346
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:45,676
[SPEAKER_07]: EA has all their good stuff behind closed doors.

347
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:51,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, I guess they just don't want the general public forming opinions on games like we're doing right now.

348
00:28:51,939 --> 00:29:00,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Konami needs to take that advice and hide Silent Hill, the new one, because it's awful.

349
00:29:01,758 --> 00:29:08,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried it again today, that's right, and it was still bad, so that whole day did not make a difference Where is that?

350
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:12,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have, or else, I haven't seen it I think it's at Microsoft's booth somewhere, unless it's buying closed doors like everything else, I don't know

351
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:29,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that means I have to go to that hall again.

352
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:30,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask Bobby.

353
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:31,303
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in chat.

354
00:29:31,343 --> 00:29:32,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, you're not in chat.

355
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:32,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, ask Bobby.

356
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:33,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby's in the chat room.

357
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:34,564
[SPEAKER_06]: He might be able to tell you.

358
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:40,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe you can relay the message to me right now since we're live and you can read the chat room.

359
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:43,548
[SPEAKER_06]: You will just have to do some research.

360
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:44,628
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

361
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:50,931
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, Miklatov, thank you very much for joining us the past couple days and giving us your thoughts and impressions on what you saw on the show floor.

362
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:52,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you want to get out before we let you go?

363
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,642
[SPEAKER_07]: I ran into Akira Yamaoka twice today.

364
00:29:58,022 --> 00:29:59,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you stalking him?

365
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:02,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is another time that I did not text you about.

366
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:05,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Because at that point, is it really worth it?

367
00:30:06,385 --> 00:30:08,666
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a daily occurrence now.

368
00:30:08,786 --> 00:30:10,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you asking for his picture every time?

369
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:14,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you making eye contact with him and giving him flirty eyebrows?

370
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:15,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you give him a hug?

371
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:20,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already given him a side hug before.

372
00:30:20,431 --> 00:30:24,015
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, full on, manly, pat on the back hug.

373
00:30:24,175 --> 00:30:24,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.

374
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:26,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And close your eyes.

375
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:27,538
[SPEAKER_07]: He loves that.

376
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:30,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Miklatoff only does Christian side hugs.

377
00:30:32,684 --> 00:30:32,904
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

378
00:30:32,924 --> 00:30:33,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed that last part?

379
00:30:34,926 --> 00:30:35,747
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you say?

380
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:37,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I said you only give Christian side hugs.

381
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:40,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay, that's probably true.

382
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:52,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, every time I've gone up to him, I keep realizing how bad his English is, and he had like a translator chick with him today, so it kind of helped, but yeah, it's kind of hard to talk to him.

383
00:30:53,705 --> 00:31:00,887
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that me running up and trying to give him a hug would help, you know, break down that language barrier or anything.

384
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:06,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Yamaoka-sama daisuki!

385
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:06,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Fail.

386
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:14,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, see, I was, you know, saying Daisuke really elongated because he would be running away.

387
00:31:16,194 --> 00:31:17,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you no hug?

388
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking of the little meme thing.

389
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:20,816
[SPEAKER_08]: So-and-so, why you know this?

390
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:31,065
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

391
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:32,486
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to let you go.

392
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:35,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to get Bobby on here, too.

393
00:31:35,588 --> 00:31:37,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Call said he'd be like security.

394
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:38,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

395
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:46,213
[SPEAKER_07]: The last time I saw him was not even near the convention center, so he has no security to call.

396
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:48,794
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are going to get thrown out of E3, though, do it on the last day.

397
00:31:48,814 --> 00:31:48,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

398
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:49,174
[SPEAKER_06]: So what?

399
00:31:49,194 --> 00:31:49,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to make out with him?

400
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:57,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you're telling me?

401
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm supposedly going to an old Konami employee meetup.

402
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,720
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not really a party.

403
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a complaint about our lives.

404
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

405
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:26,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, goodbye

406
00:32:52,409 --> 00:33:01,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm worried about this whole... You're lame and very... Oh, I meant... And I don't know if you missed it, but he called those buttons M&M minis.

407
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:05,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, that does not sound... I would not want to play a system with M&M minis for buttons.

408
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:07,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to eat some M&M minis.

409
00:33:07,754 --> 00:33:10,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have Fred Flintstone thumbs, and that's going to be a problem.

410
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:11,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan's got bigger thumbs.

411
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:13,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan's got big, wide thumbs.

412
00:33:14,356 --> 00:33:15,516
[SPEAKER_06]: One, two, three, four.

413
00:33:15,636 --> 00:33:16,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I declare a thumb war.

414
00:33:16,436 --> 00:33:17,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan's pretty vicious at thumb war.

415
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:21,196
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

416
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:24,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think we're going to go ahead and give Bobby a call.

417
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's back.

418
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know he's back because he's in the chat room.

419
00:33:27,983 --> 00:33:29,444
[SPEAKER_06]: And he should be standing by.

420
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:31,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just got to punch in his digits.

421
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:33,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to look up his digits so I can do that.

422
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:34,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Live radio.

423
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:34,529
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

424
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:42,157
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we are broadcasting live on Ustream tonight.

425
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:43,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Not our normal home.

426
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:45,400
[SPEAKER_06]: But our special home just for the night.

427
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,301
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our box out in front of the building.

428
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:50,343
[SPEAKER_06]: There might also be some video things coming in the future.

429
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I promise.

430
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:53,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep the YouStream thing bookmarked.

431
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:56,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to go to Bobby right now.

432
00:33:58,268 --> 00:33:59,329
[SPEAKER_06]: You know whenever he picks up the phone.

433
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, is it Bobby?

434
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

435
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:01,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, how you doing?

436
00:34:03,172 --> 00:34:03,872
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing good.

437
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:04,953
[SPEAKER_06]: You're better now.

438
00:34:05,153 --> 00:34:06,594
[SPEAKER_06]: You're better now that you're not in traffic.

439
00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:11,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not near the Transformer that blew up or whatever Sweet Incidentally, you have to walk to Anaheim to meet us

440
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:24,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm

441
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're just going to come down to LA live.

442
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:48,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll text you tomorrow.

443
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:50,666
[SPEAKER_06]: We can talk about that offline.

444
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:51,887
[SPEAKER_01]: We will make it work.

445
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,028
[SPEAKER_01]: LA will be our bitch.

446
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you made LA your bitch, Bobby?

447
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:58,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck LA!

448
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:02,551
[SPEAKER_07]: LA bows to me.

449
00:35:03,832 --> 00:35:06,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard you had a lot of Bethesda beer last night.

450
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:10,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't remember how much.

451
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:12,546
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good sign.

452
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:14,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I fell off the ground at about five.

453
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw there were Heinekens.

454
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:18,907
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there were Newcastles.

455
00:35:18,987 --> 00:35:19,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I meant, Newcastles.

456
00:35:19,948 --> 00:35:20,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did I say Heineken?

457
00:35:20,748 --> 00:35:21,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

458
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:22,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Newcastle's the best ever.

459
00:35:24,048 --> 00:35:25,909
[SPEAKER_06]: How was the Bethesda party?

460
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:26,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ride the bull?

461
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,549
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't ride the bull.

462
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I mainly felt like it was so packed.

463
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody was there, but it was so packed.

464
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:40,020
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried to go out and mingle, and it was just like, I'm going back to my table with Electric Sisterhood, and I'm just going to sit here.

465
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:46,522
[SPEAKER_07]: When they did karaoke, we changed the lyrics to every single song to Friday, except for the Journey song.

466
00:35:46,582 --> 00:35:48,462
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the only one we didn't turn into Friday.

467
00:35:48,502 --> 00:35:56,224
[SPEAKER_07]: But everything else somehow became talking about Friday and front seats and back seats, and which one do I take?

468
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:59,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what's funny when you're drinking a bunch of Bethesda beer.

469
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:00,896
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

470
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:01,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Beer Thesda.

471
00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:03,298
[SPEAKER_07]: And we looked.

472
00:36:03,399 --> 00:36:05,401
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not a karaoke song or I would have sung it.

473
00:36:06,963 --> 00:36:08,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Ninja Assistant get on the bull?

474
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:10,367
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

475
00:36:10,707 --> 00:36:11,108
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

476
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:13,210
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the people from their crew did.

477
00:36:13,691 --> 00:36:14,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And he sang as well.

478
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:15,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, okay.

479
00:36:15,513 --> 00:36:15,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

480
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Neither of the Fistas did

481
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:50,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it crashed on us, which was great.

482
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:51,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it crashed.

483
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,953
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, hmm, we need to do, we need to switch something out.

484
00:36:54,973 --> 00:37:02,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, like, the Skyrim logo came up and he, like, did some stuff and flashed some things and then, you know, okay, now we're continuing again.

485
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:05,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of curiosity, did they tell you to shut off your video cameras?

486
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:08,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they tell you to shut off your video cameras in that demo?

487
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:10,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

488
00:37:10,265 --> 00:37:11,646
[SPEAKER_07]: No photos, no video cameras.

489
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:16,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that one you could record audio, like I could have recorded it in

490
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:21,615
[SPEAKER_07]: No video cameras or anything in Bethesda's anything

491
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:48,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, though, you remember when we got into Bethesda, when we got the appointment with Bethesda the first year?

492
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,309
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just like, go ahead and film Star Trek.

493
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:51,970
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

494
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Star Trek was coming out soon.

495
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:56,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I was filming Call of Cthulhu, too.

496
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:56,813
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

497
00:37:56,993 --> 00:37:59,255
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like, please, please, film anything.

498
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:00,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get it out there.

499
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:00,615
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

500
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:05,319
[SPEAKER_01]: No, now with the rise of camera phones, yeah, leaks are, you know, they're instant.

501
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,900
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're, oh, record it.

502
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's on YouTube.

503
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,561
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just don't want to take that chance.

504
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:10,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

505
00:38:10,142 --> 00:38:10,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

506
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:11,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for the tangent, Bobby.

507
00:38:12,063 --> 00:38:13,004
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were watching.

508
00:38:13,144 --> 00:38:16,747
[SPEAKER_07]: They were watching for people if they happened to be holding up a phone or something.

509
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,910
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had bats.

510
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:22,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, here was one thing.

511
00:38:22,793 --> 00:38:32,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard a lot of people bitch about another RPG that came out a couple years ago that I played the sequel to today, Final Fantasy XIII.

512
00:38:33,985 --> 00:38:36,146
[SPEAKER_07]: and why am I bringing that up in reference to Skyrim?

513
00:38:36,426 --> 00:38:41,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that whole Chrysanthemum, whatever it's called, that's your skill system in Skyrim.

514
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:43,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

515
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:45,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

516
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:59,197
[SPEAKER_07]: The way that you, basically you unlock these constellations in the sky and that's how you choose your skills and inside that there's a little ring where as you get more skill points you go to the next point of the ring and it creates a little circle and stuff like that.

517
00:39:00,058 --> 00:39:00,358
[SPEAKER_07]: That's

518
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:03,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's like, I looked at it and I'm like, that's Final Fantasy XIII right there.

519
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:09,561
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, people hated it in Final Fantasy XIII, but they're probably going to love it in Skyrim.

520
00:39:11,422 --> 00:39:14,044
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

521
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:18,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, see, I got it, because I didn't bring this up last night.

522
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,288
[SPEAKER_07]: The public is an idiot.

523
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:20,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.

524
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:26,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have heard so much snark and hate and stuff from the gaming community about everything.

525
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:40,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Sitting in the chat room during the press conferences, you'd think that Microsoft took a big old dump in the middle of the stage and gave you Smell-O-Vision so you could smell it at home because they just hated everything.

526
00:39:40,905 --> 00:39:43,646
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, why do all this stuff have Kinect?

527
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:45,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Modern Warfare 3.

528
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to see Modern Warfare 3.

529
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:48,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's another Halo.

530
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:49,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wah, wah.

531
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:53,436
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, and then like Nintendo's like, hey, this is like something you've never seen before.

532
00:39:53,996 --> 00:39:54,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want that.

533
00:39:55,457 --> 00:39:56,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want another Mario.

534
00:39:57,237 --> 00:39:57,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all suck.

535
00:39:58,118 --> 00:40:05,320
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and it's like, I mean, there's a lot of people out there that are like, dude, if you don't, you know, gaming may have moved on past you.

536
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And you may need to just stop gaming if there's nothing that has been shown that you like.

537
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:13,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a little bit too jaded to be a gamer, I think.

538
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:15,623
[SPEAKER_07]: and I've been seeing that a lot.

539
00:40:15,703 --> 00:40:19,641
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not here at the show floor, like there's not that much hate here, it's all the people at home.

540
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that in the absence of Loki tonight, we get Bobby doing the ranting.

541
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:25,463
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not what I expected.

542
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:27,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it would be Dan, but we get Bobby doing the ranting.

543
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:31,207
[SPEAKER_04]: But Bobby's ranting seems to come off a little bit more cerebral.

544
00:40:32,187 --> 00:40:35,790
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to let Bobby rant because he sounds like he has some things he needs to work out.

545
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's right on.

546
00:40:38,712 --> 00:40:39,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, exactly.

547
00:40:39,212 --> 00:40:41,393
[SPEAKER_01]: All I can say is agree, like times 10.

548
00:40:41,954 --> 00:40:42,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Likes this post.

549
00:40:42,914 --> 00:40:44,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

550
00:40:44,315 --> 00:40:44,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Like.

551
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:46,457
[SPEAKER_01]: People are idiots.

552
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:48,298
[SPEAKER_01]: They just can't handle it.

553
00:40:49,826 --> 00:40:53,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Reggie hit it on the head, you know, and it's funny that he walked out in public and he just said it.

554
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:58,253
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, look, you guys want things that are different, but you want something that you're comfortable with.

555
00:40:58,593 --> 00:40:59,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine, we'll fucking do that.

556
00:40:59,854 --> 00:41:00,755
[SPEAKER_01]: We're Nintendo.

557
00:41:01,196 --> 00:41:02,076
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what we do.

558
00:41:02,817 --> 00:41:03,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony's just like...

559
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:08,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, here's a better PSP in Uncharted Microsoft's like, connect!

560
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:11,863
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's just like, oh my god Why can't there be something mind-blowing?

561
00:41:11,943 --> 00:41:33,018
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because the people are spoiled They got used to these blockbuster E3 announcements every year And now the blockbusters aren't good enough Because the gaming companies got practically nothing left Or they're just not willing to show it off yet Do you think the Microsoft thing might have come off a lot different If it hadn't been spoiled literally 30 minutes before showtime?

562
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:33,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes

563
00:41:35,114 --> 00:41:39,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Halo 4 would have been much, much more important had everybody not known what was going on.

564
00:41:39,576 --> 00:41:43,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I think gamer underpants everywhere would have needed to be changed if that had not been spoiled.

565
00:41:43,577 --> 00:41:45,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, they should have led with Halo 4.

566
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:46,799
[SPEAKER_06]: You think?

567
00:41:47,259 --> 00:41:47,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

568
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,460
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

569
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I don't want to recap the press conferences.

570
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:52,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to move forward here.

571
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:59,364
[SPEAKER_06]: But Bobby Skyrim, was it as beautiful as it seems to look when I'm watching it on game trailers or wherever online?

572
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:03,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and now they probably souped it up a little bit.

573
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:07,655
[SPEAKER_07]: It was running on a big movie screen, but it looked and sounded beautiful.

574
00:42:09,356 --> 00:42:14,118
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and then you have all the weather effects and changing the weather effects and stuff like that.

575
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:15,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it look like... Go ahead.

576
00:42:15,138 --> 00:42:15,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

577
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:15,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

578
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Matt.

579
00:42:18,279 --> 00:42:23,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, does it seem like you'll sink as many hours into Skyrim as you did with Oblivion?

580
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:27,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Oblivion, you could easily sink triple-digit hours into that game.

581
00:42:27,263 --> 00:42:27,983
[SPEAKER_06]: It was disgusting.

582
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:40,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, absolutely, because they even showed, like, they walked us through a town, and like, here's all the stuff that you can do in the town, and you could just go over here and chop wood, you can do jobs like at Fable, and you know, all that stuff.

583
00:42:40,837 --> 00:42:46,980
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's, you know, lots of other side quests, other than the main story that they're packing in here.

584
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, the dragons are awesome.

585
00:42:52,122 --> 00:42:55,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, you know, watching, you know, how they fly around, and it's quick, and

586
00:42:56,299 --> 00:43:01,421
[SPEAKER_07]: All the stuff they're doing, and it's not like a patterned boss fight is what they said.

587
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:04,803
[SPEAKER_07]: They said they've got AI, so no two dragon fights will be the same.

588
00:43:05,723 --> 00:43:10,445
[SPEAKER_07]: And even our guy got hit around a couple times you probably didn't expect.

589
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:15,387
[SPEAKER_07]: They showed a couple different, like two dragon fights.

590
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:21,510
[SPEAKER_07]: They showed a dragon fight where we ran away from, and then we met up with that dragon again, and then a bigger dragon showed up.

591
00:43:22,729 --> 00:43:25,911
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was just, you know, here, let me show you how you can do these spells.

592
00:43:26,531 --> 00:43:37,736
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I can do this and I can shout this at him and I'll use this fireball on him and, you know, injure him so he hits the ground and, you know, runs up to a castle to see if other people will help him and the dragon goes up and eats those people.

593
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:38,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It was awesome.

594
00:43:39,777 --> 00:43:42,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it'll make the release date of 11-11-11?

595
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:45,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe they will.

596
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,380
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, I mean, it was

597
00:43:47,951 --> 00:43:56,357
[SPEAKER_07]: They showed us all the menu systems and so all that stuff's coded in and I think that they're in the polishing phase right now other than that one bug that crashed the thing.

598
00:43:58,698 --> 00:43:59,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they will.

599
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:00,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they'll make that.

600
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people will be pleased with it.

601
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:09,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Bethesda obviously does have the track record of releasing buggy games and games that crash and stuff.

602
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:12,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not be surprised if that's the case here.

603
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:13,788
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know,

604
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:22,082
[SPEAKER_07]: They've done that and all the stuff they've done with the menu system and the map system and kind of makes things more exciting and seamless and stuff.

605
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:24,563
[SPEAKER_07]: They've simplified the combat.

606
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,864
[SPEAKER_07]: The right trigger's your right hand and your left trigger's your left hand.

607
00:44:26,904 --> 00:44:28,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever's in it, that's what goes.

608
00:44:28,985 --> 00:44:32,346
[SPEAKER_07]: There's your shield and your sword and stuff like that.

609
00:44:32,766 --> 00:44:34,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Do the monsters still level up with you?

610
00:44:37,233 --> 00:44:38,274
[SPEAKER_07]: They did not talk about that.

611
00:44:38,514 --> 00:44:39,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

612
00:44:39,435 --> 00:44:43,538
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would assume that they would because they're Bethesda and they're evil like that.

613
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:47,461
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

614
00:44:48,062 --> 00:44:51,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so was that the only thing that Bethesda showed you or did you get to see anything else?

615
00:44:52,946 --> 00:44:57,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to see their Prey 2 demonstration.

616
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:57,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

617
00:44:59,091 --> 00:45:03,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, where it's alien noir is what they were calling it and stuff.

618
00:45:03,655 --> 00:45:05,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, running around...

619
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:22,144
[SPEAKER_07]: and basically in this game you play as a US Marshal on a plane that crashed in the first game that you actually saw in the first game so you start off there and then you actually fast forward six months later to when you're like the only human on their alien planet and you're now doing jobs.

620
00:45:22,406 --> 00:45:23,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

621
00:45:23,347 --> 00:45:23,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

622
00:45:46,058 --> 00:45:53,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so basically, and you do meet up with the character, they did say, spoiler alert, you do meet up with the character from Prey 1, eventually.

623
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting, okay.

624
00:45:54,901 --> 00:46:00,562
[SPEAKER_07]: But basically, you are a mercenary for hire, because you used to be a U.S.

625
00:46:00,602 --> 00:46:04,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Marshal, so that's why you had a gun on the plane when it crashed into whatever in Prey 1.

626
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:11,225
[SPEAKER_07]: So he basically took those skills, and now he's a mercenary, a human mercenary, on the homeworld of the aliens.

627
00:46:12,226 --> 00:46:14,068
[SPEAKER_07]: and he's actually taking jobs for the aliens.

628
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:24,616
[SPEAKER_07]: He can go through and help people or hurt people and he can corral people in and thugs will attack you as you go through this big open world thing on their alien planet.

629
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:29,640
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of interesting and I watched that until that crashed.

630
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh oh.

631
00:46:33,283 --> 00:46:40,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he was like, I need to go up to this guy and there's a climbing thing and so he starts climbing up and his arm starts going through the wall and then it just freezes.

632
00:46:41,914 --> 00:46:44,696
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sounds like... Go ahead.

633
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:49,779
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that was like, and I'm like, you know, I've seen this.

634
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:50,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool.

635
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:51,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sold.

636
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:53,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go check out something else.

637
00:46:54,102 --> 00:47:00,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, that was 15 minutes into the demo, and I didn't know how long it would take them to get the demo back up and if they'd be in the same spot.

638
00:47:01,007 --> 00:47:02,528
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all I saw.

639
00:47:02,568 --> 00:47:08,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And then since I don't like shooters, I still went over to Rage and The Racing.

640
00:47:09,671 --> 00:47:36,908
[SPEAKER_07]: so I could see how that was and it's very smooth and very fluid and I did the little three lap race and stuff but it's those enemies are a little cheap because it's I couldn't figure out how to defend myself against the missiles that they kept throwing at me so anytime I would get into third out of four anytime I got into third place I would immediately like blow up and there's nothing I could do about it they're like incoming I'm like okay what do I do okay I'll go around this corner oh it's a homing missile damn I'm blown up again

641
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,200
[SPEAKER_06]: At least you gave it the good old college try.

642
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:41,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

643
00:47:44,301 --> 00:47:45,742
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I did in the Bethesda booth.

644
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:53,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to think of what else I looked at and played today.

645
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:56,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I went in and my other appointment was with CCP Games.

646
00:47:57,767 --> 00:48:05,290
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a PowerPoint presentation with some videos embedded in about how they're going to be working Dust 5.4 into EVE Online and

647
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:35,338
[SPEAKER_07]: essentially they were talking about their vision and the technology and it's really neat and I've learned the reason they're PS3 exclusive is because Sony has relaxed a lot of their rules on what they can and can't do on PSN and Microsoft wouldn't do that Dust 514 is a multiplayer only first person shooter and it is running on the exact same servers of EVE Online as in you're going to be in the same corporation

648
00:48:36,033 --> 00:48:37,254
[SPEAKER_07]: as EVE Online players.

649
00:48:37,994 --> 00:48:42,376
[SPEAKER_07]: You can transfer money and items between EVE Online and Dust 514.

650
00:48:42,436 --> 00:48:46,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, Dust 514 is the only way you can be on a planet, and EVE Online is the only way you can be in space.

651
00:48:47,979 --> 00:48:48,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

652
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:55,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And so corporations that already have wars going on now will have the added dimension of the wars in Dust 514.

653
00:48:57,364 --> 00:48:58,985
[SPEAKER_07]: And they will be fighting on the planet.

654
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:04,368
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, because you see this in the trailer, and they're like, yes, this is exactly how it works.

655
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:13,515
[SPEAKER_07]: The people playing Dust 514 can call up to the people playing EVE Online in orbit around the planet and say, I need an orbital strike, I need a laser strike.

656
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:20,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And the people playing EVE can then call down this big massive laser that's in orbit to incinerate something.

657
00:49:21,651 --> 00:49:23,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Dust514 is tailored for first person shooter fans who

658
00:49:43,015 --> 00:49:43,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

659
00:50:07,516 --> 00:50:09,957
[SPEAKER_07]: and also Dust514.

660
00:50:10,137 --> 00:50:14,018
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a PSN title, downloadable, $20 or $30.

661
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:16,819
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't really say the price, but somewhere around there.

662
00:50:17,419 --> 00:50:20,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a downloadable title and then it's free to play.

663
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:20,980
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no monthly fee.

664
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:26,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And that money, they call it a cover charge, is what they call buying the title.

665
00:50:27,202 --> 00:50:31,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And that money that you pay for that gets turned into in-game currency.

666
00:50:31,564 --> 00:50:36,205
[SPEAKER_07]: So you start off with money already in your account, which is

667
00:50:36,638 --> 00:50:39,960
[SPEAKER_07]: basically the market value of what you just paid for that cover charge.

668
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that kind of how EVE Online works too?

669
00:50:43,002 --> 00:50:50,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you can buy, like they support real money trade because they endorse it, or they monitor it, they provide it.

670
00:50:52,367 --> 00:51:04,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, there's a monthly subscription for EVE Online, but if you're good enough, you can actually buy, they're called PLECs, Pilot License Extension Cards, in the game that give you 30 more days.

671
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:06,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right, okay, okay.

672
00:51:07,337 --> 00:51:15,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can, you know, trade them in-game and stuff, like people, and that's how, you know, some corporations will actually pay people to play the game for them by giving them Plex.

673
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:16,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

674
00:51:16,902 --> 00:51:30,868
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can do that, so, you know, yeah, so it's an amazing economy, and they were even talking about, you know, some of the wars and stuff that have gone on, and they even, like, actually referenced one of these player corporations in their trailer video, where it was...

675
00:51:31,897 --> 00:52:01,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember, it might have been like the Netherlands or something was where this corporation was from and they were fighting a Russian corporation in this one sector of space and you know the Russians were outpowering them and outmaneuvering them and stuff but the Dutch kept coming back and they couldn't figure out why and so there was espionage in the game by these corporations, CCP had nothing to do with this espionage in the game where they kind of figured out that the Americans were funding the Dutch because they didn't want to fight the Russians directly

676
00:52:02,883 --> 00:52:07,587
[SPEAKER_07]: So they cut off the trade route, wiped out that Dust Corporation, and that was the end of it.

677
00:52:08,047 --> 00:52:18,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's stuff like that, because they say games like World of Warcraft and EverQuest, those are theme parks, where there are quests given to you, and it's the same thing every time and stuff like that.

678
00:52:19,356 --> 00:52:20,637
[SPEAKER_07]: EVE Online, it's the sandbox.

679
00:52:21,618 --> 00:52:26,601
[SPEAKER_07]: They give you the stand, the bucket, the area, and you make the story.

680
00:52:27,122 --> 00:52:31,285
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what they're saying that Dust 5.4 is going to do, it's the same type of thing.

681
00:52:31,915 --> 00:53:00,256
[SPEAKER_07]: and the reason it's geographically like that is because of time zones and stuff that's when people are playing and so they expect that that's going to be the same way and they did say that for latency if you're worried about lag since it's a first person shooter EVE Online can handle latency the first person shooters they're actually going to have battle servers in various parts of the world so you'll be connecting to that instead because their main EVE Online server cluster is in London

682
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:04,881
[SPEAKER_07]: So currently when you play EVE Online, their supercomputer is in London.

683
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:08,183
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, they said it weighs more than a ton.

684
00:53:09,363 --> 00:53:26,492
[SPEAKER_07]: They said how many machines it was, but they didn't, I can't remember the number, but they're going to have battle servers in geographic locations so you have a low ping when you're playing Dust 514 because most console games are peer-to-peer where one of the other

685
00:53:27,461 --> 00:53:28,922
[SPEAKER_07]: and PS3s is the server.

686
00:53:29,343 --> 00:53:34,287
[SPEAKER_07]: In this, the server is EVE Online and Sony was the only one that allowed them to do that.

687
00:53:34,787 --> 00:53:35,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

688
00:53:35,307 --> 00:53:44,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also said that, because I asked, you know, you're infuriating a lot of PC players and stuff and they're like, EVE Online's been around for over eight years.

689
00:53:46,076 --> 00:53:47,477
[SPEAKER_07]: You can read between the lines on that.

690
00:53:48,956 --> 00:53:49,216
[SPEAKER_06]: KaiJudo asks,

691
00:54:11,569 --> 00:54:39,547
[SPEAKER_07]: when can I get my hands on some dust they are doing a very closed beta at the end of the year which is going to be closed in the sense of it's going to go to the high end EVE online players and you know handpicked people but sometime next year but they've been laying the groundwork for dust inside EVE for the last three years with their expansions like you know planetary building planetary formations and stuff like you could build refineries on planets that started two years ago that was in preparation for dust and that

692
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:40,489
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

693
00:55:10,414 --> 00:55:18,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave just said, we're talking about our philosophy in creating games, and here's what we're trying to do, and here's what we've already done, and we're awesome.

694
00:55:19,258 --> 00:55:23,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's okay, because you've got so much information about it that you're still a little hyped for the game.

695
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:28,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, at the end of the day, it'll really be about, well, how does it pull off?

696
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:33,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Because although it sounds awesome in theory, like, what if this breaks EVE Online?

697
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:33,803
[SPEAKER_06]: But these...

698
00:55:35,864 --> 00:55:38,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, like you said, EVE Online's been around for eight years.

699
00:55:39,186 --> 00:55:45,130
[SPEAKER_06]: It may not be a quote-unquote competitor to WoW, but it's always been a great alternative to WoW.

700
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:51,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I think of a game like Star Trek Online, which I played just a little bit during the beta, but Jamie, you were really into.

701
00:55:51,374 --> 00:55:57,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing with Star Trek Online for me is that I loved the away team stuff, but I did not like the space combat at all.

702
00:55:57,417 --> 00:55:59,579
[SPEAKER_06]: But what if that was two separate games?

703
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:02,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I could just play a game that's nothing but away team stuff.

704
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have been all over that.

705
00:56:03,962 --> 00:56:07,803
[SPEAKER_04]: See, it actually kind of got turned around for me that I liked the space stuff.

706
00:56:07,843 --> 00:56:11,763
[SPEAKER_06]: See, you could play Eve, I could play Dust, and we could still kind of be in that same universe.

707
00:56:11,783 --> 00:56:12,303
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's cool.

708
00:56:12,523 --> 00:56:22,045
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always something I kind of wanted, you know, that you had your, I mean, yeah, it's a little different with Star Trek, but I think that I get the thing.

709
00:56:22,105 --> 00:56:23,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be really cool.

710
00:56:25,086 --> 00:56:25,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

711
00:56:25,606 --> 00:56:26,546
[SPEAKER_06]: So, interesting.

712
00:56:26,846 --> 00:56:27,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Fascinating.

713
00:56:28,206 --> 00:56:30,127
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't get off the ship, you're stuck there.

714
00:56:30,147 --> 00:56:32,047
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like the most fascinating part of my day.

715
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:32,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

716
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:39,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, I don't know if you can follow that up with other impressions and other things you saw that maybe fascinated you a little bit.

717
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:42,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, no, I can.

718
00:56:42,091 --> 00:56:48,096
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I got an interview with this guy because, you know, I was kind of walking around and I passed by Nyko's booth.

719
00:56:48,856 --> 00:56:51,959
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they make all those, you know, the extra peripherals or whatever.

720
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:55,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, usually I'm like, eh, it's Nyko.

721
00:56:55,441 --> 00:56:57,102
[SPEAKER_07]: This time I actually stopped and looked.

722
00:56:58,924 --> 00:56:59,064
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

723
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:06,910
[SPEAKER_07]: What they've got is a device that might improve a lot for a lot of people, motion gaming.

724
00:57:07,911 --> 00:57:08,832
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called the Zoom.

725
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:24,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And what this does, it's for the Kinect, and it basically, because Kinect fires out all these infrared lasers, and that's how it determines the positioning, it actually modifies where the lasers go, and it gives it a wide-angle lens, so now you don't have to stand as far away from your TV.

726
00:57:25,805 --> 00:57:26,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

727
00:57:26,806 --> 00:57:34,312
[SPEAKER_07]: So it basically... Instead of being six to eight feet away, you can now be four to six feet away.

728
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:36,594
[SPEAKER_08]: And in true Nyko fashion, it'll kind of work.

729
00:57:36,614 --> 00:57:44,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Two players of Connect Adventures can be, you know, stand kind of where one player would stand before.

730
00:57:46,082 --> 00:57:48,944
[SPEAKER_07]: And it worked pretty well from what I was seeing on there.

731
00:57:48,984 --> 00:57:53,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have an interview with a guy talking about that and, you know, how much it's going to cost.

732
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:55,979
[SPEAKER_07]: which is not that expensive.

733
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,521
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only $30 and it's coming out in August.

734
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:05,845
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be great for those of us that live in apartments and things where we're a little more cramped up or just if you have a lot of stuff like some people do.

735
00:58:06,285 --> 00:58:06,946
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds great.

736
00:58:06,966 --> 00:58:09,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Or not want to have to move the coffee table every time you want to play Kinect.

737
00:58:09,607 --> 00:58:13,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that sounds like it could be an awesome peripheral if it works.

738
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:19,173
[SPEAKER_06]: But it seems like if you were watching people play it at E3 that were normal people playing it, right?

739
00:58:19,253 --> 00:58:20,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all their people?

740
00:58:21,815 --> 00:58:24,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, I could have walked up and played it.

741
00:58:25,498 --> 00:58:25,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

742
00:58:25,978 --> 00:58:27,359
[SPEAKER_06]: You just didn't want anyone to get that on video.

743
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

744
00:58:32,602 --> 00:58:37,326
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's see, what else did I... I did play Final Fantasy XIII too.

745
00:58:37,986 --> 00:58:38,466
[SPEAKER_06]: How was that?

746
00:58:40,128 --> 00:58:41,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if Shane talked about that or not.

747
00:58:42,469 --> 00:58:48,313
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Final Fantasy XIII plus Shenmue.

748
00:58:49,434 --> 00:58:50,935
[SPEAKER_07]: With the quick time events and stuff.

749
00:58:52,499 --> 00:59:01,086
[SPEAKER_07]: and it built some other neat camera things and it is going to be a little bit more open-ended and stuff.

750
00:59:01,107 --> 00:59:09,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Final Fantasy XIII, it gave you that sense of urgency of the linearity of it and then when you weren't as urgent, then you could roam around.

751
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:13,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that sense of urgency is probably not going to be there as much in XIII too.

752
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:13,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

753
00:59:13,938 --> 00:59:14,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

754
00:59:16,738 --> 00:59:19,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, and one of the things that happened to me is that a monster joined my party.

755
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had a monster in my party.

756
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I had my two humans and then like

757
00:59:46,638 --> 00:59:48,199
[SPEAKER_07]: This monster suddenly was in my party.

758
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:48,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why.

759
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:52,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't hear anything, so I didn't know if it was to explain in dialogue.

760
00:59:52,682 --> 00:59:57,085
[SPEAKER_07]: But depending on what paradigm you were in, that monster changed.

761
00:59:57,105 --> 01:00:02,569
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a little fire plant in commando mode, but when you turn him to Ravager, he turned into this big Cerberus thing.

762
01:00:03,669 --> 01:00:06,091
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of cool.

763
01:00:06,511 --> 01:00:14,797
[SPEAKER_07]: And they introduced this, and I didn't really understand it all that much, once again, because I was on the show floor, but you've got a little Mog with you.

764
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:26,446
[SPEAKER_07]: and when enemies appear a little countdown timer appears and however quick you hit the enemies that determines if you get the first hit or if they hit you first or whatever.

765
01:00:27,386 --> 01:00:39,012
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of interesting and they did some of these cinematic events and live events and stuff while you're just walking around and you can still walk around and the camera will change to show something happening.

766
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:42,274
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was kind of cool.

767
01:00:42,734 --> 01:00:43,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sold on it.

768
01:00:45,814 --> 01:00:48,235
[SPEAKER_06]: But you also like XIII, right?

769
01:00:49,035 --> 01:00:49,215
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

770
01:00:49,436 --> 01:00:51,196
[SPEAKER_06]: You also like XIII.

771
01:00:51,797 --> 01:00:52,957
[SPEAKER_06]: You also like XIII, though, right?

772
01:00:52,977 --> 01:00:53,777
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people didn't.

773
01:00:55,178 --> 01:00:56,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I like XIII.

774
01:00:57,619 --> 01:01:02,981
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, keep that in mind when I say that, that I, you know, since I like XIII, you know, I like XIII, too.

775
01:01:03,001 --> 01:01:04,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I like what they added to it.

776
01:01:04,522 --> 01:01:10,244
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is, you know, the core gameplay of the paradigm shifting and all that stuff, that's still there, XIII.

777
01:01:10,284 --> 01:01:11,905
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't change, at least not what I saw.

778
01:01:13,259 --> 01:01:17,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that maybe there's enough there to kind of squelch the haters a little bit?

779
01:01:19,444 --> 01:01:19,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

780
01:01:19,764 --> 01:01:20,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Haters are going to hate.

781
01:01:21,485 --> 01:01:22,305
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

782
01:01:22,786 --> 01:01:23,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds familiar.

783
01:01:23,726 --> 01:01:25,608
[SPEAKER_06]: GamersHateEverything.com, right?

784
01:01:25,868 --> 01:01:26,348
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

785
01:01:26,568 --> 01:01:26,788
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

786
01:01:27,549 --> 01:01:29,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

787
01:01:30,551 --> 01:01:31,131
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see.

788
01:01:31,171 --> 01:01:34,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to think of what else I kind of walked by and got to see.

789
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:38,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I was running around and stuff.

790
01:01:39,137 --> 01:01:40,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I did go into Atlas's booth a little bit.

791
01:01:41,727 --> 01:01:45,028
[SPEAKER_07]: in their little meeting room area that was open so I could get into it.

792
01:01:46,008 --> 01:01:56,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were showing Rock of Ages, which is the only one that they... Rock of Ages, and they were showing Catherine, and they were talking about other things, but those were kind of the only ones they were showing.

793
01:01:57,532 --> 01:02:08,196
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played Rock of Ages, and it's kind of hard... The thing about E3 that people don't realize is that a lot of times they dump you in the middle of things, and there's not always a tutorial.

794
01:02:08,755 --> 01:02:12,777
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's not always a guy standing there telling you, okay, here's what's going on.

795
01:02:13,437 --> 01:02:14,797
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had no clue what I was doing.

796
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:25,822
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a tower defense game and then it's Katamari Damacy but not really because it's not tank controls and you're trying to break down another guy's castle and it was kind of interesting.

797
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:32,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that I'd like it more if I played it, you know, knowing what I was doing but that one was kind of cool.

798
01:02:32,605 --> 01:02:36,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't, you know, there was too many people for Catherine and the place was getting cramped so I didn't get to go in there.

799
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:38,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

800
01:02:40,003 --> 01:02:43,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So, trying to think of what else.

801
01:02:45,488 --> 01:02:48,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember seeing anything on my Twitter that I'm missing?

802
01:02:49,271 --> 01:02:52,253
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mostly wanted to hear about Skyrim, though.

803
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:54,295
[SPEAKER_06]: But you were getting some feedback on Twitter today.

804
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:58,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Any good questions you were able to get answered for people on Twitter?

805
01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:00,060
[SPEAKER_06]: At Twitter.com slash BobbyBlackWolf?

806
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:02,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

807
01:03:02,222 --> 01:03:05,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I started answering questions, and then Loki actually answered them better than I did.

808
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:12,247
[SPEAKER_07]: because they weren't giving me exact dates and he'd be like, oh no, that's coming out on February 12th.

809
01:03:12,427 --> 01:03:21,831
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing, I didn't get to play this yet, but a good colleague of mine, Shadow Next Gen, he's actually sitting right across from me right now.

810
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:22,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Howdy.

811
01:03:23,732 --> 01:03:27,654
[SPEAKER_07]: He was able to get in to see the demo of Fable the Journey.

812
01:03:28,654 --> 01:03:28,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

813
01:03:28,854 --> 01:03:31,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And we learned something that not many people are talking about.

814
01:03:31,256 --> 01:03:31,696
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

815
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:34,157
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is not on rails.

816
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:37,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it sure looked like it was on rails.

817
01:03:37,426 --> 01:03:38,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay.

818
01:03:38,406 --> 01:03:47,969
[SPEAKER_07]: It sure looked like it, but according to Mr. Molyneux, who apparently gave that particular demo just because he had nothing else better to do, he said it's not on rails.

819
01:03:48,649 --> 01:03:51,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know you can believe everything that Molyneux says.

820
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:53,730
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always dead on accurate.

821
01:03:54,151 --> 01:03:55,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Not overhyped at all.

822
01:03:57,606 --> 01:03:58,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Yeah

823
01:04:27,648 --> 01:04:32,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the game I did play today, and this is the reason I forgot about this because it was the first one I did this morning.

824
01:04:33,532 --> 01:04:34,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to Disneyland already.

825
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:37,255
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already been to Disneyland.

826
01:04:37,355 --> 01:04:39,236
[SPEAKER_06]: You went to play Disneyland Adventures, huh?

827
01:04:40,617 --> 01:04:40,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

828
01:04:41,017 --> 01:04:42,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Connected Adventures with Disney characters.

829
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:54,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And that one, the way that you move in that, and it's kind of interesting and funny, like in the overworld, the Disneyland area, they actually have like the quest markers that look just like tables, like the little yellow circles around things.

830
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:55,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

831
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:55,690
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that.

832
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:56,952
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that with Alice in Wonderland characters.

833
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:27,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so, it basically, you know, when you guys are saying it's connected ventures with Disney, that's pretty much what it is.

834
01:05:27,645 --> 01:05:35,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I guess to me, like, I didn't get to do the Peter Pan one, but it's been a while since I've been there, but it's not a one-to-one representation of the ride.

835
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:42,755
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I hope the Alice in Wonderland ride is not you in a golf ball with Alice hitting you

836
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:48,318
[SPEAKER_07]: and sending you down and all these cards are trying to get in your way and you have to jump over them.

837
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:50,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I can guarantee you the ride is not like that.

838
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, you will not have to worry.

839
01:05:52,021 --> 01:06:00,870
[SPEAKER_06]: If we do end up going on that ride on Friday, we will not get pelt golf balls at you unless you want that full experience because we are going for research purposes.

840
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,732
[SPEAKER_04]: That's only on It's a Small World.

841
01:06:02,772 --> 01:06:04,534
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what you feel like by the time you get out of it.

842
01:06:05,205 --> 01:06:08,307
[SPEAKER_06]: When a small world breaks down, the puppets start pelting things at you.

843
01:06:08,347 --> 01:06:11,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've been in there during Christmas.

844
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:16,392
[SPEAKER_01]: All those people are actually people who were trapped inside of the ride when it broke down.

845
01:06:17,093 --> 01:06:18,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were turned into little mannequins.

846
01:06:19,094 --> 01:06:21,015
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you sing forever.

847
01:06:22,757 --> 01:06:27,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So was it enough to make you go, gosh, I might actually kind of want to get this game?

848
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Or were you like, nah, this is just the same crap with a new label?

849
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:35,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, gosh, I might want to put this game on my Gamefly queue.

850
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:38,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, kind of in the middle, alright.

851
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:42,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it from Gamefly, get my achievements, then get out, right?

852
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:42,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

853
01:06:44,024 --> 01:06:44,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

854
01:06:45,024 --> 01:06:46,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

855
01:06:46,505 --> 01:06:46,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

856
01:06:47,606 --> 01:06:53,630
[SPEAKER_07]: So, other than that, I'm really, I mean, I talked to the PlayStation Home developers a little bit.

857
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:54,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh?

858
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:57,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm probably going to be doing an interview with them, because Blender...

859
01:06:58,585 --> 01:07:18,462
[SPEAKER_07]: asked me about, you know, because they're in this big freezing bug, and they, you know, I was talking to some people that actually work on, I think, content creation and stuff, but they were like, yeah, we addressed that finally, like, you know, yesterday, and, you know, blah, blah, blah, and they have, like, things that they want people to do if they encounter, like, we want this far and wide, and I'm like, so are you willing to go on the air about that?

860
01:07:18,522 --> 01:07:23,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, ooh, I'd love to, but I've got to talk to PR, so I may have this huge PS Home interview

861
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:25,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow.

862
01:07:25,161 --> 01:07:27,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm soliciting questions on Twitter tonight.

863
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:28,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people have sent me some real good ones.

864
01:07:29,426 --> 01:07:29,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

865
01:07:29,806 --> 01:07:31,969
[SPEAKER_07]: But I may be able to record an interview there.

866
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:34,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet there's a lot of questions people have about PlayStation Home.

867
01:07:34,792 --> 01:07:35,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, when's it getting out of beta?

868
01:07:39,196 --> 01:07:40,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a Google product?

869
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:42,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

870
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think it's out of beta.

871
01:07:45,082 --> 01:07:46,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they take the word beta out of home?

872
01:07:47,368 --> 01:07:52,872
[SPEAKER_06]: No, when I launched it earlier today, or last night, you know how I went into PlayStation Home and it was completely on accident?

873
01:07:52,952 --> 01:08:01,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I meant to go in the store, and I accidentally, because my thumbs are fat like Fred Flintstone, I went up and I went into PlayStation Home instead.

874
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:05,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, well, shit, now that I launched this, I might as well just kind of look around.

875
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I clearly noticed the beta tag still on it.

876
01:08:08,161 --> 01:08:11,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, hasn't this been around for like two years now?

877
01:08:11,343 --> 01:08:13,345
[SPEAKER_06]: At least.

878
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:13,845
[SPEAKER_06]: At least.

879
01:08:16,357 --> 01:08:32,585
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I did kind of walk through the IndieCade booth, which is all the independent games, where they had NerdTwister as an actual twister with a voice telling you where to put your next hand or foot, on what color.

880
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:38,188
[SPEAKER_07]: But the way that they did it, I think they called it Twister Annapolis 5000.

881
01:08:38,268 --> 01:08:38,668
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a race.

882
01:08:42,034 --> 01:09:08,432
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody starts at the end and I posted a picture of this on Twitter and it says real long twister board and everybody starts at one end of the twister board and it says okay right hand blue and so you put your right hand on blue and you know and you're trying to go forward and whoever makes it to the end first without losing one of their you know without raising one of your other hands they're declared the winner so that that was

883
01:09:09,432 --> 01:09:11,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, that was not the craziest thing that I saw in the indicator.

884
01:09:37,364 --> 01:09:38,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh dear, okay.

885
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:45,629
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to get a picture of this, but by the time I thought about getting the picture of it, they were not playing it anymore.

886
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,131
[SPEAKER_07]: It is called a kiss controller.

887
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:49,692
[SPEAKER_06]: A what?

888
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Where a kiss controller.

889
01:09:52,593 --> 01:09:52,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

890
01:09:54,154 --> 01:09:56,596
[SPEAKER_06]: As in... I thought he said a tits controller.

891
01:09:56,616 --> 01:10:03,360
[SPEAKER_07]: You kiss this little device, you kiss this little device, and that actually like, they were showing like it does a bowling game.

892
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,782
[SPEAKER_07]: And the better kissers you are, the better...

893
01:10:10,267 --> 01:10:15,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't want to approach it because I didn't want you to do it myself.

894
01:10:15,809 --> 01:10:17,669
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to get a picture of somebody else doing it.

895
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:20,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

896
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:23,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, they were putting those booth babes to work, weren't they?

897
01:10:26,612 --> 01:10:30,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, and there was this other game that had like a gas mask, and I didn't know what that was.

898
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:31,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what that was.

899
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:34,695
[SPEAKER_07]: But the guy was wearing like a full-on gas mask and playing, you know,

900
01:10:35,256 --> 01:10:35,576
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

901
01:11:07,213 --> 01:11:34,496
[SPEAKER_06]: well now Bobby I know you've got one more day left at E3 and I know as part of your day tomorrow you're going to continue your Twitter adventures where you let the listeners of your show and the OLR listeners who jump in there and want to follow you and direct you around too look at whatever but what else haven't you seen yet that you're like I've got to get this tomorrow before this stuff's done okay well I want to see what everybody's talking about with Saints Row the 3rd

902
01:11:36,161 --> 01:12:04,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see Child of Eden if I can find it you just need to talk to Miklatov because that's exactly what he talked to us about today were those two games yeah so I this is not for the show for this show but no I mean I want to see both of those because also like even like Loki was twittering me have you seen go see Saints Row go see Saints Row and I'm like okay I will I promise I just wasn't in that hall I've been in the for two days now I've pretty much been in the hall that like Sony and Nintendo was in so I think I'm done there

903
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:10,853
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm going to go try to spend as much as I can in the main hall.

904
01:12:11,273 --> 01:12:18,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm considering trying to get in the line for the Vita, but if it's really longer than the Wii U line, I think I'm going to skip on that.

905
01:12:18,255 --> 01:12:22,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Miklatov waited four hours today, so take it or leave it, I guess.

906
01:12:22,856 --> 01:12:23,936
[SPEAKER_04]: But he said it was worth it.

907
01:12:25,577 --> 01:12:31,699
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, then he continued to say, I'm not waiting in that Wii U line, so... I don't know.

908
01:12:31,799 --> 01:12:31,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

909
01:12:31,919 --> 01:12:32,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so...

910
01:12:33,911 --> 01:12:34,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

911
01:12:34,511 --> 01:12:35,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I may or may not do that.

912
01:12:35,631 --> 01:12:36,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

913
01:12:36,612 --> 01:12:38,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I really need to catch up on some stuff.

914
01:12:38,332 --> 01:12:53,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see if I can get into the Fable Room to see that and really just kind of go around and see the stuff that's in that hall because that's where they've got a video game museum has a booth here.

915
01:12:53,175 --> 01:13:02,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to kind of stop by and see that and see if there's other Tensha Hall type companies in that area that I haven't gone in and seen

916
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:05,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen Dead Island yet.

917
01:13:06,437 --> 01:13:09,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw where it was in Square Enix's booth, but I haven't actually seen it yet.

918
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:19,807
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to go see Dead Island, you've got to run up to Aubrey and talk to her like she sends out her emails to everybody.

919
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:20,848
[SPEAKER_07]: OMG!

920
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:24,010
[SPEAKER_07]: She is not on the floor.

921
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:28,253
[SPEAKER_07]: She's up in the meeting room suites, and I was unsuccessful in getting an appointment up there.

922
01:13:28,794 --> 01:13:29,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, bummer.

923
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I've even tweeted her.

924
01:13:31,501 --> 01:13:34,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, look, I just want to say hi.

925
01:13:34,925 --> 01:13:35,746
[SPEAKER_07]: How does this happen?

926
01:13:35,806 --> 01:13:39,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have an appointment, but I'd like to make an appointment to say hi for 30 seconds.

927
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:40,110
[SPEAKER_07]: How does this happen?

928
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:41,111
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got no response.

929
01:13:41,231 --> 01:13:43,414
[SPEAKER_06]: She's probably like, ew, a creepy stalker, ew.

930
01:13:45,236 --> 01:13:45,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

931
01:13:45,836 --> 01:13:47,158
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a creepy stalker.

932
01:13:49,797 --> 01:13:50,157
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

933
01:13:52,499 --> 01:14:04,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Bobby, I know some of the stuff you're going to see tomorrow at the show you will give more impressions on on your own show, which, of course, Sunday night at All Games Radio or more information available at BobbyBlackwolf.com, right?

934
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:05,907
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

935
01:14:06,367 --> 01:14:06,648
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

936
01:14:06,808 --> 01:14:07,048
[SPEAKER_07]: 8 p.m.

937
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:07,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Eastern, 5 p.m.

938
01:14:07,808 --> 01:14:08,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Pacific.

939
01:14:08,269 --> 01:14:09,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk about that stuff.

940
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:14,573
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, I'll actually talk about the Wii U games because we didn't really talk about the games.

941
01:14:14,593 --> 01:14:16,133
[SPEAKER_07]: We just talked about the controller itself.

942
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:16,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

943
01:14:16,634 --> 01:14:18,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk about some of the conceptual demos.

944
01:14:20,188 --> 01:14:21,969
[SPEAKER_07]: and more of that stuff.

945
01:14:22,769 --> 01:14:28,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we might have a very famous person's bumper premiere this Sunday.

946
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:29,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, exciting.

947
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:31,471
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be very, very cool.

948
01:14:33,871 --> 01:14:36,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, we won't be here to hear it because we'll be on our way back from L.A.

949
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:38,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Bobby, if you want, you can go along.

950
01:14:41,033 --> 01:14:41,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I could.

951
01:14:42,731 --> 01:14:43,572
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll hear it tomorrow.

952
01:14:43,592 --> 01:14:44,612
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll hear the bumper tomorrow.

953
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:45,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, okay.

954
01:14:45,473 --> 01:14:45,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

955
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:45,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited.

956
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:47,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I get a sneak peek.

957
01:14:47,474 --> 01:14:47,974
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, awesome.

958
01:14:47,994 --> 01:14:48,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, us.

959
01:14:48,455 --> 01:14:48,935
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

960
01:14:49,155 --> 01:14:49,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

961
01:14:49,575 --> 01:14:50,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Exciting early preview.

962
01:14:50,716 --> 01:14:53,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But Bobby's going to make me sign an NDA, so sorry, guys.

963
01:14:53,277 --> 01:14:54,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't be able to tell you what it is.

964
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:54,978
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have to tune in Sunday.

965
01:14:56,319 --> 01:14:57,800
[SPEAKER_06]: NDA or I get thrown off the Matterhorn.

966
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:58,520
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

967
01:14:59,581 --> 01:15:05,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Bobby, thank you so much, not only for contributing to our show, but making it your show as well.

968
01:15:05,384 --> 01:15:06,485
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate that.

969
01:15:07,525 --> 01:15:19,115
[SPEAKER_06]: You've supported us forever, and we appreciate you sharing your E3 with us and being so dedicated and missing Bethesda beer for a little bit last night to talk to us and whatever you might be doing tonight.

970
01:15:19,476 --> 01:15:20,757
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really appreciate it.

971
01:15:20,777 --> 01:15:21,157
[SPEAKER_06]: We all do.

972
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:25,020
[SPEAKER_07]: And one last kind of off-topic thing.

973
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:30,405
[SPEAKER_07]: As we were leaving E3, I'm walking along, and there's a guy walking toward me.

974
01:15:31,546 --> 01:15:32,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I recognize him somewhat.

975
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:38,003
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not looking up, so he almost runs into me because I start trying to get his attention by getting in his face.

976
01:15:39,023 --> 01:15:43,124
[SPEAKER_07]: And DJ Tyrant almost ran right through me.

977
01:15:44,704 --> 01:15:46,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think he was going to the show floor today.

978
01:15:46,344 --> 01:15:47,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder what he did.

979
01:15:47,104 --> 01:15:47,624
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well.

980
01:15:48,045 --> 01:15:49,385
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

981
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:57,206
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to a party tonight, and since his girlfriend has never been to E3, he basically took her over there just so they could see what was in the lobby and stuff.

982
01:15:57,226 --> 01:15:57,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I got you.

983
01:16:03,109 --> 01:16:07,016
[SPEAKER_07]: but they're going to some party, one of the E3 parties we got an invite to tonight.

984
01:16:07,457 --> 01:16:07,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

985
01:16:07,817 --> 01:16:08,779
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why they were there.

986
01:16:08,979 --> 01:16:15,070
[SPEAKER_07]: He was going as the place was closing and we were leaving and I recognized him so I got him, you know, and so he almost pulled me over.

987
01:16:15,424 --> 01:16:16,104
[SPEAKER_06]: How funny.

988
01:16:16,284 --> 01:16:17,625
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a small world.

989
01:16:17,705 --> 01:16:19,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I met up with DJ Tyrant today.

990
01:16:19,606 --> 01:16:19,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

991
01:16:20,227 --> 01:16:20,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

992
01:16:20,587 --> 01:16:20,947
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

993
01:16:21,307 --> 01:16:23,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll be meeting up with you tomorrow, Bobby.

994
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:31,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, sadly, those antics are not going to be broadcast, but we're looking forward to the post E3 party in the Magic Kingdom at Electronica Friday night.

995
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:35,435
[SPEAKER_06]: We hopefully will get maybe a little bit of video at Flynn's.

996
01:16:35,595 --> 01:16:35,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

997
01:16:35,915 --> 01:16:40,417
[SPEAKER_06]: If DarkSakura wears something pretty and she's willing to be on camera, maybe we can get something at Flynn's.

998
01:16:40,437 --> 01:16:40,778
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be fun.

999
01:16:40,798 --> 01:16:41,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.

1000
01:16:41,478 --> 01:16:41,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.

1001
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:42,178
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1002
01:16:43,519 --> 01:16:46,462
[SPEAKER_07]: And I cannot wait for that gift shop to take all my money.

1003
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:47,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1004
01:16:47,143 --> 01:16:49,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they could take all my money.

1005
01:16:49,465 --> 01:16:54,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be like some of the reaction I saw to the Wii U. Just take my money, Nintendo.

1006
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:54,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Just take it.

1007
01:16:55,491 --> 01:16:55,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.

1008
01:16:56,753 --> 01:16:56,993
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1009
01:16:57,554 --> 01:16:57,774
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1010
01:16:57,814 --> 01:16:58,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

1011
01:16:59,055 --> 01:17:01,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Be safe tomorrow and tonight.

1012
01:17:01,177 --> 01:17:02,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever you end up doing, we'll see you tomorrow.

1013
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:04,361
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1014
01:17:04,381 --> 01:17:05,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

1015
01:17:05,161 --> 01:17:05,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, Bobby.

1016
01:17:06,716 --> 01:17:28,247
[SPEAKER_06]: The one and only Bobby Blackwolf Of course doing the show before us at All Games Radio Sunday nights He starts at 5 Pacific We start at 6 Pacific on Sunday nights We will not be live this coming Sunday But he will and it sounds like he's going to have a hell of a show He's going to have a celebrity bumper More impressions on the Wii U So he could just take the whole four hours for all I care

1017
01:17:31,377 --> 01:17:39,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's it for our guests, but I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1018
01:17:39,779 --> 01:17:43,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I notice we don't have nearly the turnout tonight live that we did last night.

1019
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:52,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of that is that most of what you guys have been able to watch and see you saw in those press conferences, so maybe it's kind of out of your system at this point.

1020
01:17:52,423 --> 01:17:52,963
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

1021
01:17:53,383 --> 01:17:56,104
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's open, if anyone does want to call us, give us a call.

1022
01:17:56,364 --> 01:18:00,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1023
01:18:01,825 --> 01:18:04,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we just actually had a Facebook post by Naoki.

1024
01:18:05,026 --> 01:18:06,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what did Naoki say on Facebook?

1025
01:18:07,047 --> 01:18:07,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot news.

1026
01:18:07,927 --> 01:18:12,229
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy who's behind, he's a producer of DDR recently, right?

1027
01:18:12,269 --> 01:18:15,089
[SPEAKER_04]: The 2011's new DDR has been announced for Wii.

1028
01:18:15,209 --> 01:18:16,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Its name is Dance Dance Revolution 2.

1029
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:19,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Its title concept is Back to Basic.

1030
01:18:20,231 --> 01:18:23,192
[SPEAKER_04]: The originality of DDR is the part where you play with your feet.

1031
01:18:23,272 --> 01:18:29,153
[SPEAKER_04]: We have concentrated on that part and created the content so that it will pursue the gameplay of traditional DDR.

1032
01:18:29,273 --> 01:18:29,653
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

1033
01:18:30,034 --> 01:18:36,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only for the casual fans, but we consider this title will be something that can be enjoyed by core DDR fans for a long period of time as well.

1034
01:18:36,615 --> 01:18:39,216
[SPEAKER_04]: We are aiming for the release of the title for this fall.

1035
01:18:39,616 --> 01:18:43,137
[SPEAKER_04]: We will do our best to respond to your expectations, so please look forward for it.

1036
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:44,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

1037
01:18:44,576 --> 01:18:47,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So Naoki's saying the DDR2 on the Wii is going back to basics.

1038
01:18:47,837 --> 01:18:53,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, without saying it, none of this balance board and flinging the Wii mode around gimmicky shit.

1039
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:54,841
[SPEAKER_06]: He's saying it is back to feet.

1040
01:18:55,842 --> 01:18:58,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what makes DDR fun?

1041
01:18:58,623 --> 01:18:58,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1042
01:18:59,984 --> 01:19:00,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget it.

1043
01:19:01,165 --> 01:19:03,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a new feature?

1044
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:05,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my sad trombone?

1045
01:19:08,049 --> 01:19:09,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the soundboard right now.

1046
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:10,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, you guys harmonized.

1047
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:11,411
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

1048
01:19:14,141 --> 01:19:15,441
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1049
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:43,714
[SPEAKER_06]: After the Wii U was revealed And my question to you guys Do you think that's a big deal?

1050
01:19:43,874 --> 01:19:56,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It was right after the keynote It went down to 16,970 yen That's roughly 212 dollars But that is down 5% A low that the company has not seen Since before the launch of the original Wii

1051
01:19:58,931 --> 01:20:27,187
[SPEAKER_06]: is this damning for them or is this eh whatever I think it's people being fickle and then you know not thinking about it so but if I'm not mistaken most of the gamers I'm seeing posting on Twitter I mean no offense guys but I don't think it's the same people that are following the Japanese stock exchange or having a lot of impact on that or even know what stock is apart from chicken now hold on I won't go that far I'm sure people have investments and things it's a knee jerk reaction you know the stockholders

1052
01:20:27,987 --> 01:20:29,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't like that, but I'll buy one

1053
01:20:49,016 --> 01:20:49,597
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1054
01:21:06,676 --> 01:21:07,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And more fictional amounts.

1055
01:21:07,757 --> 01:21:16,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, one thing that I did read about price is that even though Nintendo has not said anything, I guess there's been hints from things like, you know, conversations with executives indirect.

1056
01:21:17,367 --> 01:21:18,448
[SPEAKER_06]: It will not be out for $250.

1057
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:19,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

1058
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:26,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're looking at least probably $299 for this thing, if not maybe even jumping up $349 or something.

1059
01:21:26,436 --> 01:21:29,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with all the competition, you know, out there at...

1060
01:21:31,195 --> 01:21:31,355
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1061
01:21:31,715 --> 01:21:33,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it sub $200 now for a 360?

1062
01:21:33,296 --> 01:21:35,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.

1063
01:21:35,537 --> 01:21:40,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And $200 for the top end 360 or PS3.

1064
01:21:40,919 --> 01:21:48,602
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta wonder how far Nintendo can push that without seeing the competition get some bump from it.

1065
01:21:49,501 --> 01:22:16,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, speaking of stock, and I wanted to mention this, but I'll let the chatter say it, because they said it too, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, Zappy says, stocks fluctuate, not a big deal, Apple went down too after Worldwide Developer Conference, and that's the first thing that came to my mind, is that, well, don't these things usually dip after Apple press conferences, and especially when all the stuff happened with the antenna, you know, and their little apology press conference they did with that, I'm sure stock dips for them a lot too, but they...

1066
01:22:16,841 --> 01:22:20,322
[SPEAKER_06]: They're Apple, and they're still doing just fine all these years later.

1067
01:22:20,562 --> 01:22:22,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're making a couple bucks.

1068
01:22:22,543 --> 01:22:23,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple bucks.

1069
01:22:23,263 --> 01:22:23,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Not doing too bad.

1070
01:22:24,164 --> 01:22:30,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, several people in chat have mentioned this, and BlackWolf's now saying, he's in chat now, kind of cooling off with the listeners there, talking to them.

1071
01:22:31,166 --> 01:22:34,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys cover that Nintendo announced that they were ditching friend codes?

1072
01:22:34,768 --> 01:22:36,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I had not heard that until I walked into the studio.

1073
01:22:36,508 --> 01:22:41,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody posted it in chat earlier, but apparently Nintendo will be ditching friend codes for the Wii U.

1074
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:41,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

1075
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:43,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally!

1076
01:22:43,111 --> 01:22:45,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems like a solid idea.

1077
01:22:45,253 --> 01:22:46,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

1078
01:22:46,514 --> 01:22:48,676
[SPEAKER_06]: That is one way to get the hardcore gamer base back.

1079
01:22:48,816 --> 01:22:50,077
[SPEAKER_06]: That's smart.

1080
01:22:50,597 --> 01:22:52,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if they've said much more about online.

1081
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:52,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me look.

1082
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claws giving us a little link here so we can take a peek.

1083
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:01,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1084
01:23:03,508 --> 01:23:10,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going right now to the story at MTV multiplayer blog.

1085
01:23:10,779 --> 01:23:13,622
[SPEAKER_01]: because MTV is all about the video games.

1086
01:23:28,094 --> 01:23:40,940
[SPEAKER_06]: On hand at E3, Ubisoft producer Adrian Blunt According to him, the day of friend codes are gone Demonstrating Ghost Recon Online for the Wii U I asked him, equivalent to a gamer tag on Xbox Live?

1087
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:52,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly, he said There's a few things on that The first is the ability for individuals to make accounts Rather than a machine having an account, each individual user has an account

1088
01:23:53,767 --> 01:23:56,109
[SPEAKER_06]: He continued saying, You know what that sounds like to me?

1089
01:23:56,149 --> 01:24:00,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember a couple weeks ago on the show, we were speculating that the system tied into Facebook somehow?

1090
01:24:15,766 --> 01:24:43,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's like exactly Facebook but I bet you anything this whole like find your friends online is going to be some type of maybe that's where the Nintendo stream comes in folks maybe the Nintendo stream is the online component and the stream is so and so has been playing Super Mario Wii and so and so just got caught in catch me I see Dan laughing over there you think I'm full of it or oh no no I was laughing about the fact that Nintendo has products called the Wii and the stream

1091
01:24:44,068 --> 01:24:45,509
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1092
01:25:04,764 --> 01:25:06,505
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just having fun with the what-ifs.

1093
01:25:06,925 --> 01:25:17,190
[SPEAKER_04]: But I still think the Facebook concept of Nintendo Book... For the record, I got mildly curious, and there are already a full page of search results for Wii U fan pages.

1094
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:24,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw in our chat says, I bet the gamer tag thing Nintendo has coming is tied to your Club Nintendo account.

1095
01:25:24,733 --> 01:25:25,213
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1096
01:25:45,219 --> 01:25:45,739
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1097
01:26:01,209 --> 01:26:16,202
[SPEAKER_06]: so and so filled out a survey and said something about you hide yeah exactly hide no I do that too but it's just frustrating that bullshit shows up in the first place yeah but if Nintendo were to somehow kind of contain all that a little better might be interesting

1098
01:26:17,228 --> 01:26:17,568
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

1099
01:26:38,724 --> 01:26:41,706
[SPEAKER_06]: is apparently using 360 and PlayStation 3 footage.

1100
01:26:42,147 --> 01:26:44,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people are going, fail Nintendo.

1101
01:26:45,529 --> 01:26:49,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Nintendo, why didn't you tell people this is 360 PS3?

1102
01:26:49,472 --> 01:26:50,853
[SPEAKER_06]: You're lying, Nintendo.

1103
01:26:51,733 --> 01:26:54,535
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm kind of thinking, is this really a big deal?

1104
01:26:54,555 --> 01:26:55,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1105
01:26:56,917 --> 01:27:04,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of figured it was PC or 360 footage because, I don't know, the system's a year away.

1106
01:27:04,679 --> 01:27:05,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

1107
01:27:05,499 --> 01:27:06,960
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've got the licenses for it.

1108
01:27:07,921 --> 01:27:13,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And keep in mind, for all the third-party stuff, it's probably what they've been provided by the developers.

1109
01:27:14,244 --> 01:27:15,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely right.

1110
01:27:15,324 --> 01:27:15,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely right.

1111
01:27:15,785 --> 01:27:20,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And I bet a lot of these deals were probably sealed a month, two months ago.

1112
01:27:20,947 --> 01:27:22,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Very short time.

1113
01:27:22,548 --> 01:27:23,989
[SPEAKER_06]: These games are concepts still.

1114
01:27:24,529 --> 01:27:25,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can tell you this.

1115
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:28,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is from a designer.

1116
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:35,542
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're working for a client and you say, okay, well, you want me to advertise this product for you, I need some of your images.

1117
01:27:36,023 --> 01:27:38,403
[SPEAKER_04]: They will send you what they have of the item.

1118
01:27:38,484 --> 01:27:40,224
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't care how big it is.

1119
01:27:40,704 --> 01:27:42,365
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't care what it originally was on.

1120
01:27:42,765 --> 01:27:47,207
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just sending you pictures of the item, what their PR has approved.

1121
01:27:48,147 --> 01:27:51,189
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get what they give you.

1122
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:55,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, you're Nintendo, how stupid can you be?

1123
01:27:57,192 --> 01:28:00,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I know exactly what you're saying.

1124
01:28:00,594 --> 01:28:09,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember back in the Genesis days and the Atari days where they'd show a screenshot of a game and it'd be for all these systems and you know it was the screenshot of the best looking version.

1125
01:28:10,099 --> 01:28:12,561
[SPEAKER_01]: But Nintendo's out there to make a statement.

1126
01:28:12,881 --> 01:28:16,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo's out there to say, this is our system and this is what it could do.

1127
01:28:16,603 --> 01:28:18,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, fine, do what you gotta do.

1128
01:28:19,244 --> 01:28:25,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the code on your PC mock-up of the Wii U and play the game and hope that it runs.

1129
01:28:25,552 --> 01:28:26,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it runs, great.

1130
01:28:27,073 --> 01:28:27,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it on your video.

1131
01:28:28,235 --> 01:28:34,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't throw these pictures out into the world and be like, this is what our system will do.

1132
01:28:34,582 --> 01:28:39,548
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like a day later be like, oh, by the way, yeah, that's the competition system.

1133
01:28:40,302 --> 01:28:40,842
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1134
01:28:41,322 --> 01:28:41,783
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1135
01:28:42,163 --> 01:28:43,263
[SPEAKER_01]: At least don't admit it.

1136
01:28:43,724 --> 01:28:44,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Lie.

1137
01:28:44,964 --> 01:28:45,924
[SPEAKER_04]: You've lied before.

1138
01:28:46,305 --> 01:28:49,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Dungeon Buster says they're placeholders to give the crowd an impression of what it could do.

1139
01:28:50,086 --> 01:28:50,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, exactly.

1140
01:28:50,927 --> 01:28:51,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that.

1141
01:28:51,647 --> 01:28:52,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no problem with that.

1142
01:28:53,087 --> 01:28:54,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a problem with that.

1143
01:28:54,468 --> 01:28:55,569
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a problem with everything.

1144
01:28:55,889 --> 01:28:56,449
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.

1145
01:28:56,489 --> 01:28:57,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not mad.

1146
01:28:57,389 --> 01:28:58,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a problem with you.

1147
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, of course you do.

1148
01:29:01,131 --> 01:29:14,881
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't, I mean, the smarter thing to do would have been to put in super tiny print in the bottom corner like conceptual video based on existing game footage or something just to cover their ass.

1149
01:29:14,901 --> 01:29:16,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, but they didn't do that.

1150
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:17,662
[SPEAKER_01]: They put those pictures out there.

1151
01:29:17,682 --> 01:29:22,886
[SPEAKER_01]: They put the pictures, especially, you know, the one game in there that really got a pop was when Ninja Gaiden showed up.

1152
01:29:23,046 --> 01:29:23,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1153
01:29:23,386 --> 01:29:26,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody was like, oh, fuck, it's Ninja Gaiden.

1154
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:28,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's on the Wii U and it looks really, really cool.

1155
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:33,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you should have known that was the PS3 version or the 360 version, kids.

1156
01:29:33,091 --> 01:29:46,174
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that kind of left me like, okay, maybe it wasn't smart to do that was the Ghost Recon where they were showing the scope and it gave you that impression that somebody was using their little Wii U controller as the scope.

1157
01:29:46,954 --> 01:29:50,775
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it looked like to me, but it was often the 360 version or the PS3 version.

1158
01:29:51,355 --> 01:29:59,124
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's true about the guts of this machine, it's gonna be basically a 360 with some extra little frills.

1159
01:29:59,204 --> 01:30:03,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a boost in the RAM, a boost in the shading, graphical components of it, and so forth.

1160
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:09,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Nintendo's going all in that their system has to be at least as good as the 360 or the PS3.

1161
01:30:11,158 --> 01:30:13,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Systems that have existed for five years now.

1162
01:30:13,219 --> 01:30:17,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's safe to say their system will be graphically capable of more than that.

1163
01:30:17,922 --> 01:30:18,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

1164
01:30:18,463 --> 01:30:21,985
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to at least be this level of graphics, this generation.

1165
01:30:22,245 --> 01:30:33,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is why they did show that little, for what it's worth, that little random ass Asian flower flying in the bird into the pool and everybody went, shit, that looks...

1166
01:30:36,154 --> 01:30:39,516
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the Wii U. That doesn't exist anywhere else.

1167
01:30:39,636 --> 01:30:41,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was the Wii U's development system.

1168
01:30:41,678 --> 01:30:41,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1169
01:30:42,498 --> 01:30:45,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, you know, is a high-spec PC.

1170
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:49,803
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and if I see, okay, well, that's capable, then I'm sure they can pull off the 360 PS3 stuff.

1171
01:30:49,823 --> 01:30:57,148
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you remember back in the day when the PlayStation demo disc was out and it had all the ducks in, you know, all over the water?

1172
01:30:57,589 --> 01:30:58,349
[SPEAKER_01]: And that T-Rex?

1173
01:30:58,449 --> 01:30:59,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And the T-Rex.

1174
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:01,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone was like, oh, wow, that's neat.

1175
01:31:01,351 --> 01:31:04,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And how many games did we get that really looked like that until the end of the PlayStation's life?

1176
01:31:05,554 --> 01:31:05,794
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

1177
01:31:05,854 --> 01:31:06,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right.

1178
01:31:06,274 --> 01:31:08,055
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that kind of thing.

1179
01:31:09,675 --> 01:31:10,576
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so early.

1180
01:31:10,796 --> 01:31:14,997
[SPEAKER_01]: People are obsessing over the tiniest detail of a system that's a year and a half away.

1181
01:31:15,137 --> 01:31:16,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And will change.

1182
01:31:16,397 --> 01:31:18,278
[SPEAKER_01]: And will not be the same when it comes out.

1183
01:31:18,318 --> 01:31:18,878
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be better.

1184
01:31:19,398 --> 01:31:21,259
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be better than the stuff that's out there now.

1185
01:31:21,839 --> 01:31:24,140
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't not be because you cannot buy...

1186
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:38,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Graphical components that are as weak as the stuff that's in the PS3 and the 360 now It doesn't exist They're going to be better They're not going to be next generation better They're going to be peak of this generation better

1187
01:31:39,798 --> 01:31:40,338
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?

1188
01:32:00,166 --> 01:32:02,387
[SPEAKER_06]: from the chat room, Colibri for Wii U. Yeah, that was me.

1189
01:32:02,507 --> 01:32:03,528
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Jamie.

1190
01:32:05,048 --> 01:32:08,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of, though, one of the fears that I have is that it's going to pull a Dreamcast.

1191
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:23,016
[SPEAKER_04]: That since it's coming out well before other systems of this nature, do you think that it might actually end up shooting itself in the foot?

1192
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:26,732
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because it's Nintendo and Sega only ever really had Sonic.

1193
01:32:27,732 --> 01:32:33,034
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, I'm saying like as far as like catching and getting people and drawing them in and so forth.

1194
01:32:33,094 --> 01:32:37,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if Nintendo's launching with a Smash Brothers game, they got nothing to worry about.

1195
01:32:37,076 --> 01:32:38,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo's not launching with a Smash Brothers game.

1196
01:32:40,078 --> 01:32:43,659
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be out until that system's first holiday season.

1197
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

1198
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:46,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Which will be the season that comes out?

1199
01:32:46,841 --> 01:32:51,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only system that ever launched with a Smash Brothers game, at least close to launched, was the Cube, right?

1200
01:32:52,389 --> 01:32:58,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, by the way, we found out today, you won't be playing that on the Wii U. Because the Wii U has taken out the GameCube compatibility.

1201
01:32:58,092 --> 01:32:58,972
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1202
01:32:59,492 --> 01:32:59,833
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1203
01:32:59,853 --> 01:33:00,593
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a GameCube.

1204
01:33:00,613 --> 01:33:00,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't care.

1205
01:33:01,073 --> 01:33:01,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1206
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:02,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of like that.

1207
01:33:02,074 --> 01:33:03,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not too surprised about that.

1208
01:33:03,434 --> 01:33:06,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Nintendo usually doesn't do backwards compatible two generations back.

1209
01:33:07,036 --> 01:33:11,958
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like your DS3DS or whatever won't play Game Boy Advance games.

1210
01:33:11,978 --> 01:33:14,980
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they took that out way back in the DSi, right?

1211
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:16,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1212
01:33:16,461 --> 01:33:17,261
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, that...

1213
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:32,539
[SPEAKER_06]: However, our PS3 will play PS1 games You couldn't play Game Boy games on your DS even though the slot was the same size Your PS3 will play Atari 2600 games It's not even the same company It's amazing

1214
01:33:33,484 --> 01:33:33,784
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1215
01:33:34,144 --> 01:33:35,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess everybody's being shy tonight.

1216
01:33:36,005 --> 01:33:36,906
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not getting any calls.

1217
01:33:36,946 --> 01:33:37,386
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

1218
01:33:37,426 --> 01:33:38,627
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with that, people?

1219
01:33:38,707 --> 01:33:39,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you, people.

1220
01:33:39,327 --> 01:33:40,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hi.

1221
01:33:41,108 --> 01:33:42,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I've closed the Skype line.

1222
01:33:42,069 --> 01:33:42,829
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your chance to call.

1223
01:33:42,849 --> 01:33:44,210
[SPEAKER_06]: See, now you guys can't call and talk to me.

1224
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:44,630
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1225
01:33:44,730 --> 01:33:46,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I've decided not to do it.

1226
01:33:46,471 --> 01:33:47,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go get Pinkberry.

1227
01:33:47,492 --> 01:33:48,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I already had Pinkberry today.

1228
01:33:49,313 --> 01:33:50,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And it sucked.

1229
01:33:50,153 --> 01:33:51,254
[SPEAKER_06]: You're trying to make me fat.

1230
01:33:52,129 --> 01:33:56,853
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to wrap up our E3 coverage, however, and call it a night.

1231
01:33:57,013 --> 01:34:00,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we didn't go as long as last night, but let's face it, all the news, most of it was yesterday.

1232
01:34:00,956 --> 01:34:04,438
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to thank again Bobby Blackwolf and Miklatov for their on-the-floor impressions.

1233
01:34:04,578 --> 01:34:05,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned a lot from that.

1234
01:34:05,719 --> 01:34:08,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned a lot more from that than I did from some of these press conferences.

1235
01:34:08,961 --> 01:34:10,783
[SPEAKER_06]: So big thanks to them as well.

1236
01:34:11,163 --> 01:34:14,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks to you guys for tuning in and listening to us over the past couple days.

1237
01:34:14,946 --> 01:34:16,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Just programming notes coming up.

1238
01:34:16,487 --> 01:34:17,328
[SPEAKER_06]: We will not be doing this.

1239
01:34:17,348 --> 01:34:19,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Rhonda said he was going to call, but he was in the bathroom.

1240
01:34:20,012 --> 01:34:20,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Loser!

1241
01:34:21,133 --> 01:34:22,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fine, I'll open it up again.

1242
01:34:22,894 --> 01:34:23,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

1243
01:34:23,595 --> 01:34:24,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I just called him a loser.

1244
01:34:24,816 --> 01:34:27,478
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the freaking line open for like ten minutes.

1245
01:34:27,498 --> 01:34:29,219
[SPEAKER_06]: That must have been the biggest poop in the world.

1246
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:32,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are lactose intolerant, Rob.

1247
01:34:32,982 --> 01:34:33,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, I'm logging in.

1248
01:34:33,783 --> 01:34:35,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, fuck lactose!

1249
01:34:37,566 --> 01:34:37,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

1250
01:34:39,298 --> 01:34:40,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Firing up Skype.

1251
01:34:40,358 --> 01:34:42,559
[SPEAKER_04]: See, we make these exceptions for Ranma.

1252
01:34:42,739 --> 01:34:44,219
[SPEAKER_01]: This is professional radio.

1253
01:34:44,419 --> 01:34:44,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?

1254
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,500
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't care about your shit.

1255
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:48,761
[SPEAKER_04]: We just care about your call, not your poop.

1256
01:34:48,941 --> 01:34:49,281

1260
01:34:57,823 --> 01:35:02,305
[SPEAKER_06]: We will not be live as usual on Sunday, which means there's no additional show on the podcast feed this week.

1261
01:35:02,645 --> 01:35:04,105
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura and I will be in L.A.

01:35:06,746 --> 01:35:07,146
[SPEAKER_06]: on Sunday.

1264
01:35:07,819 --> 01:35:10,000
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to go stop at the Bravo Cheese Farm.

1265
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:10,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1266
01:35:11,541 --> 01:35:13,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Live from the Bravo Cheese Farm.

1267
01:35:13,822 --> 01:35:14,802
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be back.

1268
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:16,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Says it shows you offline, Rob.

1269
01:35:16,863 --> 01:35:17,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Call anyway.

1270
01:35:17,743 --> 01:35:18,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I am on.

1271
01:35:18,423 --> 01:35:19,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I guarantee you it's on.

1272
01:35:19,784 --> 01:35:21,205
[SPEAKER_06]: He says he's on, so get bent.

1273
01:35:23,956 --> 01:35:25,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you just tell someone to get bent?

1274
01:35:25,638 --> 01:35:26,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I told Ranma to.

1275
01:35:27,059 --> 01:35:27,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, shut up.

1276
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:28,060
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1277
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:33,324
[SPEAKER_06]: June the 19th, we will be back live at All Games Radio.

1278
01:35:33,504 --> 01:35:35,927
[SPEAKER_06]: For more information, visit our website at Orange Lounge Radio.

1279
01:35:35,947 --> 01:35:37,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Missy is a cheese farm.

1280
01:35:37,228 --> 01:35:38,889
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow cheese on vines.

1281
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:41,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Not letting us go all night.

1282
01:35:41,151 --> 01:35:41,511
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1283
01:35:41,531 --> 01:35:42,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just try calling him.

1284
01:35:43,013 --> 01:35:43,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.

1285
01:35:44,346 --> 01:35:44,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck this.

1286
01:35:45,627 --> 01:35:46,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't see him online either.

1287
01:35:47,529 --> 01:35:48,390
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a problem.

1288
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:50,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Skype fail.

1289
01:35:50,252 --> 01:35:51,414
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a Skype emergency.

1290
01:35:51,494 --> 01:35:51,974
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

1291
01:35:53,055 --> 01:35:54,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1292
01:35:54,237 --> 01:35:55,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever could this be?

1293
01:35:55,999 --> 01:35:58,601
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are just so loving, you know?

1294
01:35:58,621 --> 01:35:59,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Four weeks later.

1295
01:35:59,502 --> 01:36:00,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so loving.

1296
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:01,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, what do you want?

1297
01:36:02,225 --> 01:36:05,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just have one thing to say, pretty much.

1298
01:36:05,989 --> 01:36:06,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1299
01:36:07,751 --> 01:36:09,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't take it anymore.

1300
01:36:10,675 --> 01:36:11,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sick of it.

1301
01:36:12,117 --> 01:36:14,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm finally going to file divorce.

1302
01:36:15,781 --> 01:36:16,102
[SPEAKER_06]: From?

1303
01:36:17,003 --> 01:36:17,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

1304
01:36:18,925 --> 01:36:20,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

1305
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:21,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody call Judge Mabel.

1306
01:36:21,768 --> 01:36:23,250
[SPEAKER_03]: But who are you cosplay?

1307
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:25,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you make Nintendo hit you, Ranma?

1308
01:36:25,273 --> 01:36:25,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I...

1309
01:36:26,704 --> 01:36:44,919
[SPEAKER_03]: After that presentation and my friends going nuts on Twitter about their presser, we kind of came to agreement that Nintendo is that abusive girlfriend that you always take back, just thinking that things are going to be different the next time around.

1310
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:49,302
[SPEAKER_06]: There is genuine concern in the chatroom what will happen to Black Luigi.

1311
01:36:49,943 --> 01:36:52,305
[SPEAKER_03]: He will be replaced by Shadow the Hedgehog.

1312
01:36:52,325 --> 01:36:52,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1313
01:36:54,068 --> 01:36:57,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, that's trading down really, really, really far.

1314
01:37:00,134 --> 01:37:01,376
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a Sega fan.

1315
01:37:03,057 --> 01:37:03,718
[SPEAKER_01]: A Shadow?

1316
01:37:03,938 --> 01:37:04,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

1317
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:06,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least be Knuckles.

1318
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:07,931
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

1319
01:37:30,548 --> 01:37:57,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta talk more about why this Nintendo hatred I have to admit I loved it when Reggie came out and we've said this before and said gamers want this and they want this so whatever you guys are confusing but here I don't know what gamers he's listening to but I didn't ask for a 6 inch Android tablet with a hacked classic controller on each side

1320
01:37:59,167 --> 01:38:00,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't ask for that.

1321
01:38:01,871 --> 01:38:03,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want one of those as a system.

1322
01:38:03,213 --> 01:38:05,157
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to put it on your table and play Othello?

1323
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:07,039
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1324
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:09,023
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome for Gauntlet.

1325
01:38:09,043 --> 01:38:10,725
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like they hired Ben Heck to make it.

1326
01:38:11,843 --> 01:38:15,445
[SPEAKER_06]: What about, though, the fact, though, Ranma, that we are still a year away?

1327
01:38:15,825 --> 01:38:19,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the reason why I'm still kind of like, it was all right.

1328
01:38:19,487 --> 01:38:20,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Their presentation was fine.

1329
01:38:21,168 --> 01:38:22,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not, like, super excited about it.

1330
01:38:23,069 --> 01:38:26,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to buy one anyway because I'm a consumer whore and I buy them all.

1331
01:38:26,671 --> 01:38:30,953
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm like, we're not really going to see this system for another year.

1332
01:38:32,114 --> 01:38:34,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe by then they'll actually get their shit together.

1333
01:38:35,355 --> 01:38:40,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you basically giving your abusive girlfriend a year to shape up or ship out?

1334
01:38:40,902 --> 01:38:59,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose so, but it's okay, because I will be marrying its younger sister, the 3DS Ah, so the 3DS, you were a fan of all the stuff you saw there Okay, yes, Mario Kart, yes, I am a Mario Kart whore like nobody else's business

1335
01:39:00,482 --> 01:39:01,183
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a given.

1336
01:39:01,583 --> 01:39:09,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And I missed Super Mario, but I went back and watched a trailer for it, and I said, this is the Mario game I've been looking for.

1337
01:39:10,373 --> 01:39:13,016
[SPEAKER_03]: A 3D platformer that plays like 2D, but it's 3.

1338
01:39:13,056 --> 01:39:14,418
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I wanted.

1339
01:39:15,079 --> 01:39:16,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I will sit here and play that.

1340
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:17,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not too fond.

1341
01:39:17,421 --> 01:39:19,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Super Mario, but hey.

1342
01:39:21,573 --> 01:39:21,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1343
01:39:21,933 --> 01:39:24,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it might still be a working title.

1344
01:39:24,615 --> 01:39:31,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seems to me that you've got this relationship with the big sister, but really you just want to sleep with the little sister.

1345
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, that's why I have a DS.

1346
01:39:35,222 --> 01:39:35,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1347
01:39:36,921 --> 01:39:37,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1348
01:39:38,402 --> 01:39:38,762
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1349
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:41,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Rob, any other closing thoughts on E3 before we let you go?

1350
01:39:44,023 --> 01:39:45,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1351
01:39:45,524 --> 01:39:46,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft was a bit of a snore.

1352
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:50,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony had me with the Vita.

1353
01:39:50,185 --> 01:39:51,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll say this right now.

1354
01:39:51,746 --> 01:39:55,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the Vita with 3G powered by AT&T is going to be $299.

1355
01:39:56,407 --> 01:40:00,028
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm telling you, when it comes out, you'll be able to get it for $99.99 with a two-year contract.

1356
01:40:03,689 --> 01:40:05,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark my words!

1357
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:06,791
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not how they sell iPads, though.

1358
01:40:07,212 --> 01:40:08,532
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they sell iPhones.

1359
01:40:09,473 --> 01:40:11,995
[SPEAKER_03]: iPads, iPhones, netbooks for 3G.

1360
01:40:12,255 --> 01:40:14,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, it worked for the taco, didn't it?

1361
01:40:14,517 --> 01:40:15,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, kinda.

1362
01:40:15,617 --> 01:40:16,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but we got ours for free.

1363
01:40:17,379 --> 01:40:20,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a relevant question, Ranma, since you are Black Luigi.

1364
01:40:20,561 --> 01:40:27,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And we call you that, just so people know, we call you that because whenever you cosplay and you're black and you dress up as Luigi...

1365
01:40:28,186 --> 01:40:40,522
[SPEAKER_06]: You make your way on camera no matter who's there And we always see you on TV Oh, it's Black Luigi, there he is That's why you have that name And so, Tigerclaw in chat says Ranma, what do you think of Luigi's Mansion 2?

1366
01:40:40,962 --> 01:40:44,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Since, you know, it's a game starring Luigi Nintendo finally showing some Luigi love

1367
01:40:45,097 --> 01:40:50,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for it because, you know, I've always said this.

1368
01:40:50,743 --> 01:40:54,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always said that Peach is nothing more than a whore.

1369
01:40:54,687 --> 01:40:57,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Mario's always chasing after her to save her.

1370
01:40:57,550 --> 01:41:01,094
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't freak out when Bowser kidnaps her.

1371
01:41:01,475 --> 01:41:03,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it happens three times a month.

1372
01:41:03,837 --> 01:41:09,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, and look, they're Koopa Kids, we all know who the mother is, you know, we already know.

1373
01:41:09,321 --> 01:41:18,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like you have designed this really weird, sick Mario RP world while really, really fucking high.

1374
01:41:19,129 --> 01:41:28,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I was sober at the time, it was many years ago, and I said this to a friend of mine, and it broke him, and all my other friends were like, holy shit, that actually makes sense.

1375
01:41:31,109 --> 01:41:33,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Bowser, you are the father.

1376
01:41:33,551 --> 01:41:34,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway.

1377
01:41:35,052 --> 01:41:40,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Luigi has a nice mansion, a nice car, his girl is in check, he's got the good life.

1378
01:41:40,436 --> 01:41:41,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really.

1379
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:47,440
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, Luigi's Mansion, a 10-year-old game coming back.

1380
01:41:47,961 --> 01:41:48,581
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all for it.

1381
01:41:49,582 --> 01:41:52,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, believe it or not, I actually liked the first Luigi's Mansion.

1382
01:41:52,864 --> 01:41:53,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was a fun game.

1383
01:41:55,726 --> 01:41:56,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's neat.

1384
01:41:56,867 --> 01:41:58,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Ranma, Princess Daisy don't want no scrub.

1385
01:41:59,449 --> 01:41:59,529
Pfft.

1386
01:42:00,789 --> 01:42:02,270
[SPEAKER_04]: She has an eyeball in the back of her head.

1387
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:04,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, we're going to let you go.

1388
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:04,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.

1389
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:06,111
[SPEAKER_02]: She has an eyeball in the back of her head.

1390
01:42:06,331 --> 01:42:08,192
[SPEAKER_02]: She stays in the castle, okay?

1391
01:42:08,552 --> 01:42:11,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, she also plays mean, rounded tennis.

1392
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:15,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think Luigi got on one knee and proposed?

1393
01:42:16,034 --> 01:42:18,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, I'm ending this conversation right now.

1394
01:42:18,495 --> 01:42:19,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

1395
01:42:19,436 --> 01:42:19,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay black.

1396
01:42:20,636 --> 01:42:20,896
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1397
01:42:20,916 --> 01:42:21,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1398
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:23,617
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that Daisy does have an eyeball in the back of her head.

1399
01:42:24,088 --> 01:42:25,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was a graphic glitch.

1400
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:28,151
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was awesome still.

1401
01:42:28,351 --> 01:42:33,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that someone in Mugen actually programmed an attack with the weird eye in the back of her head.

1402
01:42:33,434 --> 01:42:35,395
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because people in Mugen have too much free time.

1403
01:42:35,515 --> 01:42:36,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's great.

1404
01:42:36,896 --> 01:42:42,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you're sitting on the internet doing a podcast about E3 and you're telling the Mugen people they have too much free time.

1405
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:44,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Way too much free time.

1406
01:42:44,662 --> 01:42:45,082
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.

1407
01:42:45,622 --> 01:42:46,463
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's it.

1408
01:42:46,563 --> 01:42:47,744
[SPEAKER_06]: We're ending the show.

1409
01:42:47,985 --> 01:42:52,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for tuning into our E3 coverage, especially those of you that are tuned in, be it live or through the podcast feed.

1410
01:42:53,009 --> 01:42:54,050
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.

1411
01:42:54,351 --> 01:42:59,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to take a little break, you know, because it's going to be dead next week with E3 being done.

1412
01:43:00,536 --> 01:43:01,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1413
01:43:16,235 --> 01:43:17,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys very much for tuning in again.

1414
01:43:17,996 --> 01:43:25,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask, remember, we don't get paid for this and we don't have big money advertisements for this.

1415
01:43:25,337 --> 01:43:28,718
[SPEAKER_06]: So just tell a friend or two or five about the show.

1416
01:43:28,878 --> 01:43:30,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Word of mouth is so, so important.

1417
01:43:30,559 --> 01:43:41,962
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you listened to this show for the first time because of the Ustream presence, because it was a new place for us, come join us at our normal place, OrangeLoungeRadio.com, Sunday nights at All Games Radio, and tune in and hear us there.

1418
01:43:42,262 --> 01:43:42,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's it.

1419
01:43:43,162 --> 01:43:44,083
[SPEAKER_06]: We're closing up shop.

1420
01:43:44,863 --> 01:43:46,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thoughts, real quick though.

1421
01:43:46,183 --> 01:43:48,184
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final E3 thought.

1422
01:43:48,464 --> 01:43:48,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinkberry.

1423
01:43:49,685 --> 01:43:51,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that has so much to do with E3.

1424
01:43:52,846 --> 01:43:58,068
[SPEAKER_06]: My final E3 thought is boobies in Saints Row.

1425
01:44:00,329 --> 01:44:03,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan, the man, thank you for being here, by the way, and filling in.

1426
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:03,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

1427
01:44:03,930 --> 01:44:04,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I live here.

1428
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:05,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1429
01:44:05,151 --> 01:44:05,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Your final thought.

1430
01:44:06,071 --> 01:44:07,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace, love, recycle.

1431
01:44:07,451 --> 01:44:08,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and quit fucking bitching.

1432
01:44:09,807 --> 01:44:12,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Goodnight everybody, we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
