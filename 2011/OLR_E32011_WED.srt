00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,000
you're not as loud as you were last night. I get to sit in my own desk. The guest mic is so

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,520
freaky in here but oh well nobody cares about that. I blame you. We are live of course live on

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,240
Ustream if this is your first time listening to us here on Ustream this is not where we're usually

podcast and all that good stuff www.orangelaungeradio.com and you can listen to last

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:55,360
night's two and a half hour opus of the Wii U and Xbox and Kinect and and the Vita. We're gonna

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,400
actually get more into the Vita tonight. It is live of course you can join us in our chat room

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,560

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,480
broadcasting here live. Speaking of live sometimes interesting things happen and we actually have to

22
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
mix things up a little bit tonight. We're not gonna start with Bobby tonight. Bobby's caught

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,760
in traffic. He's still in LA downtown. I guess the last text I got is that a transformer blew

24
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,960
out somewhere. So sorry Bobby fans we're gonna have to go to him a little later but we're gonna

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,920
go right into today's coverage of E3 and from what I understand our correspondents out on the floor

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,040
got some more hands-on impressions today. As you know yesterday Bobby waited for quite a while in

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,920
that Wii U Wii U Wii U line to about what like four hours to finally get his hands on the Wii U

28
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,960
and gave us his impressions yesterday. Tonight we're gonna go straight over to Miek Letov who

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:56,000
was on the show floor and I think he was waiting for like three or four hours today to play the PS

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Vita. So it's kind of interesting that both of them have very long lines waiting to play them.

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,440
So we're gonna go to Miek Letov right now through the magic of the internet we're gonna call his

32
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,160
little cell phone and see what else he played today because I know the show hours are usually

33
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,280
longest on this second day so hopefully got to play a lot more today. I don't know if he got to

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,160
go play more Konami stuff like Silent Hill which he said it wasn't that great which made Jamie sad.

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,720
Very sad in my soul. But of course it's just his opinion it's just one opinion so we'll see maybe

36
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,960
Bobby got to play it today we'll see if he thought the same thing. Hello? Hey is this Miek Letov?

37
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,240
Yes. Hey it's Rob from Orange Launch Radio of course you should know that I just texted you

38
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,000
thanks for letting us. I know it's so surprising. Thanks for letting us mix things up a little bit

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and bringing you on first tonight. Bobby's caught in traffic where are you are you are you back at

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,280
your hotel? Yes I made it back. It's fine after 50 minutes of commuting. Do you how do you get now

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,920
yeah for those who have never been to E3 and have heard about LA traffic it really is a nightmare

42
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,840
that's why I'm not looking forward to being in it tomorrow when we go to pick Bobby up at the

43
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,040
convention center but uh it'll be all right. At least we'll have each other right Dark Sakura?

44
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,040
Yes. Right Dan? Of course. All right anyway so Miek Letov how was E3 for you today?

45
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,720
It was well I would say I only really participated in E3 today for about

46
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,400
three hours if that because today was my stand-in-line day. Today was your stand-in-line

47
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,400
day so I already mentioned that I know you stood in line for the PS Vita right? Yep. Good I'm glad

48
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,840
we get to talk about because yesterday was a little bit Nintendo heavy with all the Wii U

49
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,920
talks so I'm glad we get to talk a little bit about the PS Vita today so tell us about your

50
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,120
experiences everything from standing in line how long to when you finally got your hands on the

51
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:59,840
goods? It took about four hours for me to get through that line and I got there at about 10 30

52
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,560
so it was a bit ridiculous for the line but to make up for it if you can consider it that I

53
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,800
did play with it for about 20 minutes so I got some good hands-on time with it. Not bad yeah

54
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,680
what are your thoughts? I really like it it's definitely a great successor to the PSP

55
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:28,080
for the design part of the system the screen is beautiful it's really big it's really vibrant

56
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,480
you really don't see any pixels whatsoever definitely a nice high-desk screen

57
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,400
the the back part with the touchpad I don't like that so much because the touchpad takes up too

58
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,120
much of the back so you're constantly accidentally tapping it and in the game that you know you use

59
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,160
the touchpad on the back can kind of screw you up but that's just a minor uh minor complaint I'm

60
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,760
sure if I held it the right way because it's grips it would be a little bit better. I wonder

61
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,840
if you can just turn that crap off do you think do you think you just turn off that back touchpad

62
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,360
altogether because I didn't even think about that but yeah if you have a tendency like tap on the

63
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,560
back of your device or something it's going to totally mess with that back touch stuff right?

64
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,320
Yeah it will um I assume that some games will have that I don't think it will be a system setting

65
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,160
but so yeah there's that part and the one thing that I actually do not like about the system is

66
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,840
that the face buttons are way too small like I was playing Uncharted and I kept trying to hit

67
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,760
the x button but instead I'd hit an analog stick because that's where my fingers felt like the x

68
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,560
button should be instead of these really tiny little buttons that they give you to play with.

69
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,640
So it sounds like maybe there's some design things that need to be worked out or is this

70
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,320
is this pretty much like the final thing that you guys are seeing did they say anything about

71
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:57,600
prototype or how far along it is? Um I did not ask and they did not say I assume because of how

72
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,080
close to I mean really if you think about if it's supposed to be this this holiday it's only a few

73
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,200
months out so I'm pretty sure that this is probably the final design. I thought the ds was shown

74
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,360
and it went through a lot of changes I mean this is many years ago it was shown at e3 and it went

75
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,240
through many changes before it was released uh but maybe not because I think that might have come out

76
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,000
the ds came out what March or April I guess so thinking of the ds as being many years ago is sad

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,400
I know that was my first e3 I think all of ours was the year the ds was yeah anyhow uh so okay so

78
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,400
this isn't about the ps or the ds though it's about the ps vita um so tell us about some of

79
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,440
the games that you play and what they were like okay they had a station set up for us to go to

80
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,080
about five minutes on each or was it four I don't remember I can't remember the amount of stations

81
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,960
but I'll whisk them off um the first one we went to was the little big planet station so we got

82
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,400
to play um or you got your choice of a couple different um options in little big planet you

83
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,240
could play a stage or you could play um a two player game using just a touch screen and you

84
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,880
would play with the demo guy I opted to do just the stage because I wanted to see how it would

85
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,280
really work in the practical play um and I was really impressed uh I used everything from the

86
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,000
the touchpad to tilting the system or not touchpad sorry the touch screen to tilting the system and

87
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,720
it played like little big planet and it looked like little big planet on the ps3 so like I was

88
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,080
really impressed um one of the puzzles that had me do was there was a keyboard in the background

89
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,560
and I had to play or I had to push the keys for the musical note and then LBP and it opened the

90
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,320
door and I thought that was really cool uh and so you say it looked just like little big planet on

91
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,720
the ps3 so did it feel like it was just kind of a port of the ps3 you know original with maybe some

92
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,840
uh frills that incorporate the vita stuff like the the back touching or whatever did it feel

93
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,840
like like just a whole separate experience like it's not you know just a port I would say it felt

94
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:09,200
more like a separate experience because the vita special features really made it feel that way um

95
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,560
so like there was a part where I had to hold on to a one of the little uh spinning wheels

96
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,720
and it wasn't spinning yet so while I was holding it with the uh r trigger um or whatever it's called

97
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,920
the r button um I had to use my uh left hand to actually spin the wheel around so he would go up

98
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,960
to the top I was like that's awesome you know this is cool well I would expect talking about

99
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,200
the design of the system again in your hands and the way that whole works uh kaijuto is in our chat

100
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,320
room at chat.orangelandreay.com saying this guy must have fred flinstone thumbs do you just have

101
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:53,040
abnormal hands no no these are really small like I my hands are not big at all and these I swear

102
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,680
were like the size of mini m&ms something people might know okay there you go that's a good

103
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:07,440
comparison okay so what else little big planet and okay after that they sent us over to virtual

104
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,280
tennis which um so far these two games I was told are launch titles for the system um so virtual

105
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:23,120
tennis really nice looking um they had you play it first with the just touch screen so you would

106
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,120
press the spot on the court to move your guy you hold your finger down your guy would move

107
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,200
and then you could flick up to do a top spin and then flick down to do a back spin and it actually

108
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,240
and it actually worked really well um then I was introduced to control how is that touch screen

109
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,920
stuff different from like playing an iphone game or is that really what it felt like like oh I'm

110
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,520
playing an iphone that's really what it felt like with nice graphics okay and it was on a bigger

111
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:59,360
screen okay and um yeah so then uh he told me to do all my um hits uh with the touch screen and

112
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,240
I could move with the analog stick like okay this actually I kind of like the way that one played

113
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,480
um and then it's like oh just play normally and you know I could play normally it wasn't like

114
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,240
super impressive but it was still really fun because virtual tennis games are pretty fun

115
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,840
so after my time was up there um I went to the what's that super game called

116
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,720
little deviants that game is pretty much what I feel like they're trying to one-up

117
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:36,000
nintendo with um it seems to be a collection of mini games for the most part um there were three

118
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,280
that we got to play the first one was an ar game just like face rater to a t like with the

119
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,720
exception of putting somebody's face in it uh you just look around with your screen all over

120
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,320
all over the actual environment for these little spaceships you had to

121
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:00,320
destroy before they destroyed your little deviant characters um the next one was a whack-a-mole

122
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,600
style game that used both the touch screen and the touch pad on the back so windows would open

123
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,640
up and if they were facing you you had to touch the touch screen on them um and if they were

124
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,960
back turned to you you had to press from behind underneath um and watch out for the humans because

125
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,640
you lost points for that these all definitely sound like little like gimmicky demos that

126
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,000
to be fair is probably the same stuff the same stuff they're demoing the wii u with right now so

127
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,880
exactly um the last one was uh this uh it's the one that probably everybody's seen where you have

128
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,400
the touch pad on the back and you make the hills and you roll the ball the bvm ball guy around

129
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,880
into the whirlpool that one was probably what really frustrated me most with the the touch pad

130
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,520
on the back just because i mean it feels inevitable that you will rest your fingers on the back of the

131
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,200
pads the way they don't want you to do it um and there was no clear definition on the back where

132
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,120
the touchpad started where it ended so that one was really hard for me so little deviance though

133
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,360
it sounds like it's just a mini game collection i don't know to me it kind of sounds like a pass

134
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,400
i've seen it before what did you think uh i'm it's not a not a purchase for me at all um it was like

135
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:25,440
bundled in with the system i'm not gonna delete it but i'm not gonna purchase it okay all right

136
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:34,000
um the next one i went to uh was sound what did i call it sound something or other sound sound

137
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,680
something was it a music game um yes it kind of was um man now i feel bad because i was talking

138
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,400
about how much i love that game sound shapes i'm looking at your text from earlier sound shapes

139
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,320
yes so thank you sound shapes which is interesting because this was not even something that we saw at

140
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,080
the press conference so when you texted me that i'm like what the hell is that that must be like a

141
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:02,320
game they didn't say anything about otherwise it's been talked about before i know that um it's made

142
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,120
by the guy that did i want to say like either pixel junk or everyday shooter i don't remember

143
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,600
it's one of those two um but in it it's got two modes it's got a platforming mode which is very

144
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:24,720
simplistic shapes um you're just like little blue spiky ball looking thing but the object is to get

145
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,760
through the level and to hit these blue orbs and every time you hit a blue orb in that screen

146
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,240
it creates like the drums for the music or it creates the guitar or the keyboard so you keep

147
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,600
going looking at the audio you guys are hearing in the background i'm looking at a video of this

148
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,840
because i want to see more about what he's talking about here oh the guy's talking through it

149
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:56,000
yeah we can't have two people talking i'll i'll just look at the video then but uh yeah so you go

150
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,120
through uh different screens trying to collect all the blue orbs to create the music it was very

151
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:11,680
much a music-y platformer that caught my attention right away um i was told again launch title and

152
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,240
that people would be able to create their own stages and upload them for other people to play

153
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,560
oh cool that's really cool and that's the other part of the um demo it was he was showing me how

154
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,800
to create my own stage and placing music at certain points and placing the orbs and traps

155
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,280
and it was really cool i liked it a lot interesting as a music game fan uh this is kind of a must-have

156
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,520
for you because i'm looking at this going this does not look at all like other music games but

157
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,600
i'm i'm glad because i think it's you know i don't always need to see falling notes that you hit

158
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,320
whatever device too you know so this is kind of nice yeah i i think it's it's not only a game for

159
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,560
music fans but also for um possibly platforming fans because people who like to get high and play

160
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,280
video games what was that people who like to get high and play video games no because they'll

161
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:11,520
probably like try to eat their psv or drop it thinking it's some crazy monster okay we need

162
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:20,000
we need we need new crack since moja ribbons already out that's kind of like it's simplistic

163
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,760
like that like like the brib and stuff so i think it was great um definitely gonna be the first game

164
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,080
i buy because it was the one that impressed me the most which makes me sad because the next demo

165
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,600
playing too was uncharted and that was the game that at first announcement had pulled me on the

166
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,120
vita before it was called that and before i played it um and it didn't disappoint me per se uh i think

167
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,080
it looked beautiful and played like uncharted my problem with it is those tiny little m&m buttons

168
00:16:52,080 --> 00:17:01,120
that um like they just got in my way i couldn't perform moves as well uh i definitely got shot

169
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,000
and killed twice during our demo because i couldn't get the button properly um that wasn't

170
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,080
any of the top screen controls of what was that did you try any of the touch screen controls

171
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,600
stealth takedowns jumping stuff like that see that that's what i'm about to i was about to say

172
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,000
is that like i like the what they called painting where you move your finger across like ledges and

173
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,920
he would move there that was cool but once you used it for hand-to-hand combat i hated it i

174
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,000
absolutely thought it was stupid because i have to instead of like you know position myself with

175
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,560
the camera and my body for the next enemy after i'm done punching this guy to death it takes one

176
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:51,360
hand off of that and i have to focus on tapping the little fist icon which was stupid i thought

177
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,160
you would like that because when i was seeing that in the trailer i was like that looks like

178
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,600
elite beat agents and that's like belita's favorite game no no it's nothing like that

179
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,560
at all it was frustrating and kind of annoying but um i'm sure that that will not be the only

180
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:15,200
way to play um i don't even could probably use the little m&m buttons to hit too but uh the demo

181
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,280
i didn't get a chance to try that because like oh use the touch screen only for combat it's like

182
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:29,520
okay thanks for getting me killed but um yeah that ended the ps vita experience so it was

183
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:36,960
worth the four hour wait yes i think so because i think i have waited in long lines at e3 to four

184
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,200
and not come away as satisfied as i did with the vita okay all right so now what's interesting

185
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,720
though is that you even though you enjoyed the vita and you're like okay i definitely want this

186
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,960
sound shapes game and there's a couple other things i played that i want i really need them

187
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,360
to fix some of these design issues even though there might not be any time now yeah i i don't

188
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,040
think the little buttons will hold me back from purchasing one because i think a lot of that has

189
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,520
to do with my hands being more accustomed to holding like a psp so it like my my fingers

190
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,360
gravitate to where um i think it's going to be at because i mean let's be honest it looks just like

191
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,640
a psp it's a little bit like longer um a little bit wider and a lot lighter actually it's like

192
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,840
nothing in your hands whatsoever um let me ask this question real quick because you know you

193
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,440
said that you definitely want to get the ps vita and i walked away from the sony press conference

194
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,560
saying i'm not really sure i understand why i need a vita still and and my whole thing was that

195
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:44,000
okay it just looks like it's a uh you know psp with a back touch thing a front touch thing and

196
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,280
slightly more power so what once it's slightly more power a lot more power a lot more but we'll

197
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,160
see i think the psp as it is still holds up and looks really really good there's a lot of really

198
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,520
good looking games on there so the psv is even better yes interesting i guess maybe the

199
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,840
screenshots online is such just don't do it justice so i'm looking forward it doesn't like

200
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,240
when you see the screen in person that that's what got my attention first and then the weight

201
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,640
in my hands got it second and then it's just a really nicely designed system for once now i kind

202
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,040
of asked bobby about this yesterday because he waited in line for the wii u uh most of the day

203
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,440
you waited in line for the ps vita most of the day did you catch any kind of like buzz from people

204
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,440
around you now see the funny thing was bobby was standing around a bunch of people who didn't speak

205
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,520
english yesterday so there was like no one for him to listen to but did you did you kind of catch

206
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,360
what was the buzz what were other people saying about the vita were people complaining about the

207
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,000
controller like you were or i didn't hear any complaints about the vita except for the long

208
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,600
wait time like i had people behind me leave a couple times because they were tired of waiting

209
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,920
clearly this must have been their first c3 because you know you have to wait forever for stuff yes

210
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,120
um i didn't hear any buzz about vita i did over here i'm not sure if this is considered i'm sure

211
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:10,400
it probably has but i heard something about skyrim randomly um from a dev saying that the uh it was

212
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,320
a bethesda dev so it wasn't like some random person but they were talking to um one of the

213
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,480
naughty dog people that were over there and they said that um skyrim is going to have about 30

214
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,120
hours of main quest and 300 hours of side quest nice uh i know bobby got some i i don't know if

215
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,520
he got no he didn't get hands-on he got like a 30-minute demo with skyrim today so he was

216
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,320
he got a little special bethesda show so uh we'll talk to him more about the details there later

217
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,120
i do like over maybe i'm just nosy but i like one of my favorite things at e3 is to just like over

218
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,160
here people because people do talk about rather loudly so i can hear them about um interesting

219
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,520
stuff kind of like what you're just saying yeah so all right so the ps vita took up most of your day

220
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,880
but you were you were happy with it at the end of the day what else were you able to get your hands

221
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:04,320
on today um i got to play child of eden um which was definitely not totally what i was expecting

222
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,280
but i still really liked it um the control scheme's a little weird and it was a guy the guy that was

223
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:19,840
explained to me a wasn't from ubisoft b was from walmart and c you look at b again and realize the

224
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,360
amount of knowledge you probably had about the game um he didn't really tell me how to play

225
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:33,600
properly i don't think so it was hard to just jump in randomly and start playing but it felt a lot

226
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:41,760
like rez it looked like rez it sounded like rez um but the two firing mechanisms are different like

227
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:49,360
your left hand is like a rapid fire gun that only works on like these pinkish um enemies and your

228
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:56,400
right hand is your lock on gun gun and i couldn't tell if i was supposed to like lock on fully and

229
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,760
then like swing my hands forward to shoot or if it was just automatically shot i think i had to

230
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,280
point my hand forward but i definitely was getting hit a whole lot in that game but it was on no die

231
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,200
so it didn't matter and the music was really good i imagine uh what little i could hear yeah because

232
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,760
if this one was outside underneath the tent oh lord which is of course the optimal playing uh

233
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,360
you know environment for a music game and a connect game they must have been at that booth

234
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,960
where i think rock of the dead was shown last year and it was not a great location there's amongst

235
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,440
all you know you want what that booth was that booth was where a long time ago i think you were

236
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,120
there for the c3 where they have the balls tent set up i don't even think i remember that but

237
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,920
that's all right it's been a long time that's like not even on convention grounds it's across the

238
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,200
street oh geez oh oh god okay you were like you weren't even in the convention center at that

239
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,840
point yeah that's when i was walking there this morning and then they're like hey do you want to

240
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,760
come play some games we got brinks i was like no no i can't try out the theater it's like yep let's

241
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,200
go over there because i i still haven't found it on the show floor and i've been looking it's

242
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,040
probably not there because it's out like what next week so i don't think there's a lot more to

243
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,880
say about it so all right well what else did you use hands on um i didn't get my hands on it but i

244
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,520
did get to sit through the presentation for saint throw the third um and that was pretty funny i've

245
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,120
never liked open world games and i don't like gta or anything like that so i just kind of went in

246
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,560
with an open mind and that game looks freaking hilarious and they didn't censor the the dildo

247
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,520
bat thing that they hit people with that was really funny and they also said that you can make

248
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,400
your character naked in play i was like how is this going to get an m rating at that point

249
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,680
unless they're like built like a barbie doll naked naked to them might mean like booty shorts

250
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:56,720
you know it might be like just nothing but you know well so my male character i'd make would

251
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,440
have beauty shorts i guess that's your i i don't know if you just heard damn but la noir i don't

252
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,120
know if you play that that got an m rating and that's got full-on beaver so totally oh yeah

253
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,160
i don't know i haven't i i've got it i haven't finished it yet or even some clothes spoiler

254
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:18,880
well i guess yeah i guess if it's not like an actual fashion it won't get anything bad but

255
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,160
um that was really funny uh i liked what i saw they showed up off some open world stuff which

256
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:30,560
was just humorous and then um like you can put people in a cannon that's on a car and shoot them

257
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:37,760
out and everybody loves you because uh you're you're getting the things are like like celebrities so

258
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,080
no matter what you do they like you so you put them in a cannon you shoot them out at things and

259
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,520
you know they die and people are all excited because they're meeting you um this is gonna be

260
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,200
a totally obscure reference but this reminds me of um one of the movies that stars divine if you uh

261
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,280
know who divine is i think it's female trouble or something and you know it's always she's very

262
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,760
filthy and over the top and stuff and there's a scene where she's like who wants to die for art

263
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,520
and everybody's like me me me and so she shoots one of them and i don't know why but what you're

264
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,560
describing sounds to me like that but that's the over the top craziness is what they're going for

265
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,240
in this game so they've succeeded yeah definitely um and then they showed a mission which they were

266
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,720
uh robbing a bank and it turned out to be like you know some rival gangs bank or whatever so

267
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,120
fighting ensued and at one point during the gunfight which was really gory too um just

268
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,200
some random person in the hood he came up and asked for your autograph and you get like extra

269
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,480
points if you sign it i was like that's hilarious awesome um so is this even though you don't play

270
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,280
the gta style games it sounds like you might be interested in getting this one yeah i might try

271
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,000
this one this one looks really funny so i mean that's one thing about grandpa does it takes

272
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,040
itself pretty seriously and i don't know this just seems like like kind of like smoking aces

273
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:03,120
that would be or was it lucky number seven i don't know no that's broken aces yeah i'm not

274
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,520
looking over seven um but that's really all i got to play today i think like i'm racking my

275
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:17,120
my brain but the vita took up so much time that i don't think there was much else for today all

276
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,320
right so uh uh anything you're gonna try to look at tomorrow i mean i know we're not doing a show

277
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,240
tomorrow but anything you might want to look at i was debating on doing the wee or not and i think

278
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,320
my final decision is i'm not gonna go to it because i don't think it's worth the time um

279
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,240
so i think tomorrow is going to be catch up day like i'm gonna go try to do uncharted 3 because

280
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,280
you get like a t-shirt and some stuff for doing uncharted 3 i'm gonna go back through the 3ds

281
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,480
lines because you get pins um when you play the games and i want more pins because it's swag

282
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,880
and i and risen heaven is there for the we and i haven't got to play it yet and i really want

283
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,920
to do that because i like rhythm heaven so i might just hang out in the we and sony tomorrow and

284
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,200
just completely avoid the other hall because i mean most of the cool stuff is either behind

285
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,920
closed doors or just in video form so you're kind of finding the uh usual e3 thing that seems to be

286
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,600
more and more popular the last five years to be true where all the really good stuff is behind

287
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,880
closed doors and there's very little out there on the on the floor for the rest of you yeah yeah

288
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,800
that's too bad i don't understand the the media restrictions this year because it doesn't look

289
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:31,360
like it really changed anything i felt like if they did the restrictions it would probably mean

290
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,040
like more stuff on the floor but it feels like there's less stuff on the floor like 2k and

291
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,920
Activision all have their stuff behind closed doors i think Bethesda has all their stuff behind closed

292
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,240
doors ea has all all their good stuff behind closed doors huh wow i guess they just don't

293
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:55,520
want the general public forming opinions on games like we're doing right now so so and well cannot

294
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,800
be needs to take that advice and you know hide like silent hill when they want because it's awful

295
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,720
i tried it again today that's right and it was still bad so that whole day did not make a difference

296
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,720
how funny i was just asked it's because dark soccer is very sad to hear that silent hill

297
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,200
isn't very good i'm sad to hear it too but uh you need to try the alan wait game that's supposedly

298
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:23,120
xbox where is that i would have or else i haven't seen it uh i think it's a microsoft boost somewhere

299
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,160
unless it's uh behind closed doors like everything else i don't know oh let me just have to hear that

300
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,400
hall again ask bobby he's in chat oh wait you're not in chat i was just asked bob bobby's in the

301
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,440
chat room he might be able to tell you well maybe you can relay the message to me right now since

302
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,640
we're live and you can read a chat room you will just have to do some research all right all right

303
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,160
well uh me glitov thank you very much for uh joining us past couple days and giving us your

304
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,440
thoughts and impressions on what you saw on the show floor anything else you want to get out before

305
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:59,680
we let you go no i ran to kira yeah kiriyama okra twice today why are you stalking him yeah i did

306
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,280
another time i did not text you about because i was like at that point is it really worth it like

307
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,560
it's like a daily occurrence now are you asking for his picture every time are you are you making

308
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:17,120
eye contact with him and giving him flirty eyebrows did you give him a hug he loves i've already given

309
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:24,720
i've already given him like a side hug before no full-on manly pat on the back hug go for it

310
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,560
and close your eyes you don't know what to do because christian side is really bad

311
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,760
he what i missed that last part what did you say i said you only give christian side hugs

312
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,720
yeah okay that's probably true oh i said uh every time i've gone up to him i keep you know

313
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,280
realizing how bad his english is and he had like a translator chick with him today so it kind of

314
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:55,520
helped but yeah it's kind of hard to talk to him and i don't think that me running up and trying

315
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:06,400
to give him a hug would help you know break down that language barrier or anything fail

316
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:13,920
yeah see you know saying dice he really long elongated because he would be running away

317
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,120
why you no hug

318
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,320
speaking broken english that's like i was thinking of the the little men

319
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,200
main thing the so-and-so why you know this all right mijot we're gonna let you go uh i gotta

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,160
karaoke we changed the lyrics to every single song to friday because that's for the journey

365
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,280
song that was the only one we didn't turn into friday but everything else somehow became talking

366
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,800
about friday and front seats and back seats and you know which which one do i take because that's

367
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,240
what's funny when you're drinking a bunch of Bethesda beer that's right beer thesda and we

368
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,320
look if we look it was not a karaoke song or i would have sung it did ninja sister get on the

370
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,520
ah okay but uh neither of the sisters did all right all right well anyhow let's let's talk about

371
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,800
your day at e3 today you got to actually get a little more of the games today because yesterday

372
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,920
obviously your day was like all we you well not all but mostly right today you got to get a little

373
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,000
more into some of the other games so what tell us about some of the stuff you got hands on with

374
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,800
today i know i know skyrim was a big demo you got right you didn't you didn't get hands on but yeah

375
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,160
right yeah it's a it was a demo and and some of the things i mean it it looks really nice

376
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:54,400
um it crashed on us which is great um it crashed they're like hmm we need to do we need to switch

377
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,760
something out until like the skyrim logo came up and he like did some stuff and flashed some

378
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,880
things and then you know okay now we're continuing again out of curiosity did they tell you to shut

379
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,840
off your video cameras did they tell you to shut off your video cameras in that demo oh yeah yeah

380
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:16,320
no no photos no video cameras um that one you could record audio like i could have recorded him

381
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,800
speaking uh but yeah no video cameras or anything in defense of anything you know and um but it was

382
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,440
sorry to answer something that came up when miklotov was on the show earlier that's why a

383
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,840
lot of stuff is behind closed doors so they can take away cameras and things like that and not

384
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,680
let you use them because of what just happened when when bobby was seeing skyrim is that when

385
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,360
the game crashes then they don't want people running to youtube going look at this piece of

386
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:45,200
shit game and how it crashes well i was gonna say though you remember when we got into bethesda

387
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,240
um when we got the appointment with bethesda the first year and they just like go ahead and

388
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,520
film star trek that's cool i think a star trek was was coming out soon i was filming call of

389
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,160
cthulhu too all right they're just like please please film anything just just get it out there

390
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,080
no now with the rise of camera phones yeah leaks are you know they're instant you know you're

391
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,040
oh recorded oh it's on youtube and they just don't want to take that chance i understand sorry for

392
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,600
the tangent bob and they were watching they were watching for people if they happen to be holding

393
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:24,320
up a phone or something and they had tried to be discreet so now here was one thing is um you know

394
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,680
a lot of people i heard a lot of people bitch about another rpg that came out a couple years

395
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,200
ago uh that i played the sequel to today final fantasy 13 and why am i bringing that up in

396
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,960
reference to siren because that whole chrysanthemum whatever it's called that's your skill system in

397
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:49,840
skyrim interesting huh the way that you uh basically you unlock these constellations in

398
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,720
the sky and that's how you choose your skills and inside that there's a little ring where you get as

399
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,480
you get more skill points you go to the next point of the ring and it creates a little circle and

400
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,440
stuff like that that i mean it does like i looked at it i'm like that's final fantasy 13 right there

401
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,040
wow and like people hated it in final fantasy 13 but they're probably gonna love it in skyrim

402
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,480
of course of course double standards drive the gaming media what are you talking about

403
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,520
yeah see i got it because i didn't bring this up last night the public is an idiot

404
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,760
i think um because i i have heard so much like snark and hate and stuff from the gaming community

405
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,400
about like everything like it's like you know sitting in the chat room during the press

406
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,600
conferences like you think that you know microsoft took a big old dump in the middle of the stage

407
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,920
and gave you smell-o-vision so you could smell it at home because like they just

408
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,360
hated everything they're like why don't all this stuff that connect oh modern warfare 3 i don't

409
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:51,520
want to see modern warfare 3 oh oh it's another halo oh wah wah and you know and then like nintendo

410
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,000
like hey this is like something you've never seen before i don't want that they don't want another

411
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,680
mario you'll suck you know and it's like i mean there's a lot of people out there like dude if

412
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,600
you don't you know i gaming may have moved on past you and you may need to just stop gaming if

413
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,600
there's nothing that has been shown that you like you're a little bit too jaded to be a gamer i think

414
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,240
and i've been seeing that a lot it's not here at the show floor like there's not that much hate

415
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,680
here it's all the people at home i like that in the absence of loki tonight we get bobby doing

416
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,240
the ranting that is not what i expect i thought it would be damn but we get bobby doing the ranting

417
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,040
bobby's ranting seems to come off a little bit more cerebral i'm trying to let bobby

418
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,120
rant because he sounds like he has some things he needs to work out i think he knows what i

419
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:43,440
think he's right on oh exactly all i can say is agree like times 10 likes this post people yeah

420
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:51,120
exactly like people are idiots they just can't handle it it reggie hit it on the head you know

421
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,520
and it's funny that he walked out in public and he just said it he's like look you guys want things

422
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,080
that are different but you want something you're comfortable with fine we'll fucking do that we're

423
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:07,760
nintendo it's what we do sony's just like whatever here's a better psp and uncharted microsoft's like

424
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,240
connect and everybody's just like oh my god why can't there be something mind-blowing it's because

425
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,440
the people are spoiled they got used to these blockbuster e3 announcements every year and now

426
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,400
the blockbusters aren't good enough because the gaming companies got practically nothing left

427
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,880
or they're just not willing to show it off yet do you think the microsoft thing

428
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,360
might have come off a lot different if it hadn't been spoiled literally 30 minutes before showtime

429
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:40,080
yes halo 4 i think so too much much more important had everybody not i think gamer

430
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,320
underpants everywhere would have needed to be changed if that had not been honestly they should

431
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:50,960
have led with halo 4 you think exactly all right anyway i don't want to recap the press conferences

432
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,880
i gotta i gotta move forward here but um bobby skyrim was it as beautiful as it seems to look

433
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,960
when i'm watching it on game trailers or wherever online yes and now i mean they probably souped it

434
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,600
up a little bit it was running on a big movie screen uh but it looked and sounded beautiful

435
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,640
um you know and then you have all the weather effects and changing the weather effects and stuff

436
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:19,360
like that does does it look like and then right go ahead yeah uh go ahead go ahead now i was gonna

437
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,200
say does it seem like you'll sink as many hours into skyrim as you did with oblivion because

438
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:31,040
oblivion you could easily sink triple digit hours into that game it was disgusting yes absolutely

439
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,040
because they even showed like these they walked us through a town and like here's all the stuff

440
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,440
you can do in the town and you could just go over here and chop wood you can do jobs like a table

441
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,360
and you know all that stuff so there's you know lots of other side quests a lot other than the

442
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:52,480
main story that they're packing in here and you know the the dragons are awesome just you know

443
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,120
watching you know how they fly around and it's quick and you know all the stuff they're doing

444
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:02,160
and and it's not like a you know pattern boss fight is what they they said they said they've

445
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,560
got ai so no two dragon fights will be the same and even like our guy got you know hit around a

446
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,880
couple times probably didn't expect so i mean they showed a couple different like two dragon

447
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,080
player they showed dragon five we ran away from and then we met up with that dragon again and

448
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,520
then a bigger dragon showed up and it was just you know here let me show you how you can do these

449
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,360
spells and you know i do this and i can shout this at him and i'll use this fireball on him and

450
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,680
you know injure him so he hits the ground and you know runs up to a castle to see if other people

451
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,080
will help him and the dragon goes up and eats those people it was awesome do you think it'll

452
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:48,080
make the release date of 11 11 11 uh i believe they will it was i mean it was you know they

453
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,160
showed us all the menu systems and so all that stuff's coded in and i think that they're in the

454
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,880
polishing phase right now other than that one bug that crashed the thing but um you know i i think

455
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,680
they will i think they'll make that and um i i think people will be pleased with it now i mean

456
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,360
the fez obviously does have the track record of releasing buggy games and uh games crash and stuff

457
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:15,680
so i i would not be surprised if that's the case here um but you know they've done that and uh you

458
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,320
know like all the stuff they've done with the menu system and the map system and kind of makes things

459
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,120
more exciting and seamless and stuff and you know they simplified the combat your the right triggers

460
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,880
your right hand your left trigger your left hand whatever's in it that's what goes so you know

461
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,080
there's your shield and you know your sword and stuff like that do the monsters still level do

462
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:40,480
the monsters still level up with you they did not talk about that interesting but i i would assume

463
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:48,960
that they would because they're Bethesda and they're evil like that all right well so uh was

464
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,640
that the only thing that Bethesda showed you or did you get to see anything else i went to see

465
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:02,400
their prey to demonstration okay and and uh you know where you know it's alien noir is what they

466
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,000
were calling it and stuff and and you know running around um basically in this game you play as the

467
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,280
u.s marshal on a plane that crashed in the first game that you actually saw in the first game so

468
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,800
he you know you start off there and then you actually it fast forwards six months later to

469
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,920
when you're like the only human on their alien planet and you're now doing jobs oh i didn't

470
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,960
realize that's how they were tying it together because when you see that trailer you're like

471
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:33,520
what the hell does this have to do with prey yeah that was my literal reaction this looks awesome

472
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,000
and i showed it to alan who loves that like cloverfield and and blair witch kind of stuff

473
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,480
that's all and that's very much what the trailer is like right and it was like wow this is awesome

474
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:49,040
it's it's it's prey yeah yeah so i mean basically and you do meet up with the character they did

475
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,720
say spoiler alert you do meet up with the character from prey one eventually interesting story

476
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,960
but basically you're you are uh a mercenary for hire because you used to be a u.s marshal so

477
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,920
that's why you had a gun on the plane when it crashed into whatever in prey one uh so he

478
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,160
basically took those skills and now he's a mercenary a human mercenary on this on the

479
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,600
home world of the alien and he's actually takes jobs for the aliens he can go through and help

480
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,640
people or hurt people and he can corral people in and there's you know thugs will attack you as you

481
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:27,200
go through it's a big open world thing on their alien planet so that that was kind of interesting

482
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:34,480
and and uh you know i watched that until that crashed oh because he was like i need to go up

483
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,960
to this guy and there's a climbing thing and so he starts climbing up and his arm starts going

484
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:46,400
through the wall and then it just freezes so it sounds like uh that that would go ahead and then

485
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,040
so that that was like and i'm like you know i've seen this it's cool i'm sold i'm gonna go check

486
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,880
out something else because you know that was 15 minutes into the demo and i didn't know how long

487
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,480
it would take them to get the demo back up and if they'd be in the same spot so that's all i saw

488
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:09,760
pretty too and then i uh since i don't like shooters i still went over to rage and the racing so i

489
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,560
could see how that was and it's very smooth and very fluid and i did the little three-lap race

490
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,800
and stuff um but it's it's a very those enemies are a little cheap because it's i couldn't figure

491
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,160
out how to defend myself against the missiles that they kept throwing at me so i anytime i would get

492
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,720
into third out of four anytime i got into third place i would immediately like blow up and there's

493
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,080
nothing i could do about it like incoming i'm like okay what do i do okay i'll go around this corner

494
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:40,160
oh it's a homing missile damn i'm blown up again at least you gave it the good old college try

495
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:49,680
i did so um so yeah so i got to that's what i did in the Bethesda booth um and uh so i'm trying to

496
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,200
think of what else i uh looked at and played today i mean i i went in and my other appointment was

497
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:02,000
with ccp games and it was it was a powerpoint presentation uh with some videos embedded in

498
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,640
about how they're going to be working dust 5.4 into eve online and essentially they were talking

499
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,160
about their vision and the technology and it is it's really neat and i've learned the reason

500
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:20,800
they're ps3 exclusive is because sony has relaxed a lot of their rules on what they can and can't

501
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:28,800
do on psn and microsoft wouldn't do that dust 514 is a multiplayer only first-person shooter and it

502
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,280
is running on the exact same servers of eve online as in you're going to be in the same corporation

503
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:42,720
as eve online players you can transfer money and items between eve online and dust 514 basically

504
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,880
dust 514 is the only way you can be on a planet and eve online is the only way you can be in space

505
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,960
wow and so and so corporations that already have wars going on now will have the added dimension

506
00:48:52,960 --> 00:49:01,120
of the wars in dust 514 and they will be fighting on the planet and yes i because i as you see this

507
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,040
in the trailer and they're like yes this is exactly how it works the people playing dust

508
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,960
514 can call up to the people playing eve online and orbit around the planet say i need an orbital

509
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,840
strike i need a you know laser strike and the people playing eve can then call down

510
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:22,080
this big massive laser that's in orbit to incinerate something in the dust 514 multiplayer

511
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,400
match going on at that same time that sounds awesome i've never played eve online in my life

512
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,400
it's just not something that's really jumped out as something interesting to me but that sounds

513
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,680
amazing like i i i love how the two different games tie together like that that sounds just

514
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:44,400
awesome and dust 514 is tailored for first-person shooter fans who felt eve was too complex or out

515
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,880
of their league a little bit you know they couldn't get into it but they still like the

516
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:55,360
idea of being a part of this universe uh single shard server they said that they've had i think

517
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:02,080
64 000 people concurrent is their record of how many people have played eve online at one time

518
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:10,240
on one for her wow and and uh and also uh dust 514 it's going to be like a it's going to be a

519
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,520
psn title downloadable uh 20 or 30 bucks i don't they didn't really pay the price it's somewhere

520
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,160
around there so it's a downloadable title and then it's free to play there's no monthly fee

521
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,440
oh wow and that money and the coverage they call it a cover charge is what they call buying the

522
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:32,160
title and that money that you pay for that gets turned into in-game currency so you start off with

523
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,480
money already in your account which is basically the market value of what you just pay for that

524
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,440
cover charge isn't that kind of how eve online works too i i i think you can buy like they

525
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,040
support uh real money trade because they they they endorse it or they they do they monitor it

526
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:56,560
they they provide it yeah well yeah well it's there's a monthly subscription for eve online

527
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:01,840
but if you're good enough you can actually buy they're called plex pilot license extension cards

528
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:07,760
in the game that gives you 30 more days oh right okay okay that's how and you can you know trade

529
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,480
them in game and stuff like people and that's how you know some corporations will actually pay

530
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,800
people to play the game for them by giving them plex wow and you you can do that so you know yeah

531
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,520
so it's an amazing economy and they were even talking about you know some of the wars and stuff

532
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,760
that have gone on and they even like actually referenced one of these player corporations in

533
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,040
their trailer video where it was um i can't remember it might have been like the netherlands

534
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,280
or something was where this corporation was from and they were fighting a russian corporation

535
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:43,440
corporation in this one sector of space and you know the russians were out out out powering them

536
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,280
and out maneuvering them and in stuff but the the the dutch kept coming back and they couldn't figure

537
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,240
out why and so there was espionage in the game by these corporations ccp had nothing to do with this

538
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,280
espionage in the game where they kind of figured out that the americans were funding the dutch

539
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,800
because they didn't want to fight the russians directly so they cut off they cut off the trade

540
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,840
route wiped out that dutch corporation and that was the end of it wow so it's stuff like that

541
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,200
that they're you know because they say you know games like world of warcraft and everquest those

542
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,080
are theme parks where there are quests given to you and you know it's the same thing every time

543
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:24,160
and stuff like that eve online it's the sandbox they give you the fan the bucket you know the

544
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,520
the area and you make the story and that's what they're saying that you know dust 514 is going

545
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,720
to do with the same type of thing where you know and and the reason it's geographically like that

546
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,520
is because of like time zones and stuff that's when people are playing and so they expect that

547
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,480
that's going to be the same way and they did say that uh for latency if you're worried about lags

548
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,080
it's the first person shooter eve online is not you know it can handle latency uh the first person

549
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:56,000
shooter they're actually going to have battle servers in various parts of the world so you'll

550
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,240
be connecting to that instead because their main eve online server cluster is in london

551
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,560
so currently when you play eve online their supercomputer is in london and it's like they

552
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:12,560
said like it weighs more than a ton but i think they said how many machines it was uh but they

553
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:18,800
didn't i can't remember the number but they're going to have battle servers in uh geographic

554
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,760
locations so you have a low ping you know when you're playing dust 514 because this most console

555
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:31,040
games are peer-to-peer where one of the other ps3s is the server right in this the server is eve

556
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:37,680
online and sony was the only one that allowed them to do that interesting and they also said that uh

557
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,720
i asked you know you're you're infuriating a lot of pc players and stuff and they're like eve

558
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:49,360
online's been around for over eight years you can read between the lines on that wow i feel like

559
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:54,080
i've learned more about this game than anything else at e3 and like i i kind of just went no okay

560
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,360
and it might tie into eve online that might be kind of cool but the way you describe it i'm like

561
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,680
wow this this this almost makes me want to try eve online at least it sounds interesting yeah it

562
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,880
sounds really interesting if they pull it off that's that's fast that's fascinating how the

563
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,720
one game could impact the other like that so cool kai judo asks uh when can i get my hands on some

564
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,760
stuff they are doing a very closed beta at the end of the year which is going to be closed in

565
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,160
the sense of it's going to go to the high end eve online players and you know hand-picked people

566
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,600
but sometime next year uh but they've been laying the groundwork for dust inside e

567
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,960
for the last three years with their expansion uh like you know planetary building planetary

568
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,520
formations and stuff like that you could build refineries on planet that started two years ago

569
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,720
that was in preparation for dust and that in introduced some of the server aspects that would

570
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,720
handle dust and you know stuff like that so it was i mean it was the reason i'm talking so much

571
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,480
about it because they gave so much interesting technical information for me as a technical

572
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:58,720
person as well um that you know it's just they didn't show the game like they didn't play the

573
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:03,360
game they did with the powerpoint they showed some movies it wasn't even real like some of it was

574
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,440
real gameplay footage but you know they didn't actually have a playable where they had a playable

575
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,040
in other places before um you know they've just said you know we're talking about our philosophy

576
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:18,160
and creating games and here's what we're trying to do and here's what we've already done and you

577
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:23,200
know we're awesome and that's okay you got so much information about it that you're still a little

578
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,440
hype for the game i mean at the end of the day it'll really be about well how does it you know

579
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,800
how does it pull off because although it sounds awesome in theory like what if this breaks eve

580
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,520
online you know like but these you know again like you said eve online has been around for

581
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:43,360
eight years you know it may not be a quote-unquote competitor to wow but it's always been a great

582
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:48,720
like alternative to wow but i just like i think of a game like star trek online which i played

583
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,000
just a little bit during the beta but jamie you were really into and the thing with star trek

584
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,440
online for me is that i loved the away team stuff but i did not like the space combat at all but

585
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,760
like what if that was two separate games and like i could just play a game that's nothing but away

586
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,840
team stuff i would have been all over that see it actually kind of got turned around for me that i

587
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:11,440
liked the space see you could play eve i could play dust and we could still kind of be in that

588
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:17,120
same universe that's always something i'd kind of wanted you know that you had your position i mean

589
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,040
yeah it's a little different with star trek but i think that i get the thing it would be really cool

590
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:31,360
wow so interesting fascinating you don't get off the ship you're stuck there the most fascinating

591
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:36,560
part of my day wow all right well i i don't know if you can follow that up with other impressions

592
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:42,480
and other things you saw that maybe fascinated you a little bit okay well no i can and actually

593
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,360
i got an interview with this guy because you know i was kind of walking around

594
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,440
and i passed by nico's booth you know they make all those you know the the extra peripherals or

595
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,720
whatever and i'm like usually i'm like eh it's nico all right this time i actually stopped and

596
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:06,880
looked and what they've got is a device that might improve a lot for a lot of people motion gaming

597
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:14,480
it's called the zoom and what this does it's for the connect and it basically because connect

598
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,400
fires out all these infrared lasers and that's how it determines the positioning it actually

599
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,440
modifies where the lasers go and it gives it a wide angle lens so now you don't have to stand

600
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:32,800
as far away from your tv nice so it basically instead of being six to eight feet away you can

601
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:42,080
now be four to six feet away and two players of connect adventures can be you know stand kind of

602
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:48,560
where one player would stand before and it seemed it worked pretty well from what i was seeing on

603
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,800
there so i have a little i have an interview with a guy talking about that and uh you know how much

604
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:58,880
it's going to cost which it's not that expensive it's only 30 bucks and it's coming out in august

605
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,320
that could be great for those of us that live in like apartments and things where we're a little

606
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,280
more cramped up or just if you have a lot of stuff like some people do that sounds great or not not

607
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,400
want to have to move the coffee table every time you want to play connect i think that's that sounds

608
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,520
like it could be an awesome peripheral you know if it works but it it seems like if you were watching

609
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:20,480
people play it at e3 that were they're normal people playing it right not not all their people

610
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,520
right it's you could have i could have walked up and played it nice you just didn't want anyone

611
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:35,920
to get that on video yeah so uh but um let's see what else did i um i did play uh final fantasy 13

612
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:41,920
too how was that and i don't know if i don't know if shane talked about that or not uh it is uh

613
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:52,240
uh it is uh final fantasy 13 plus shamu because of the with the quick time events and stuff um

614
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:58,080
and and it built some uh other neat camera things and it is going to be a little bit more open

615
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,160
uh no open-ended and stuff you can you know because like final fantasy 13 it gave me that

616
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,880
sense of urgency of the linearity of it and stuff and then when you get more as urgent then you

617
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,520
could roam around well that sense of urgency is probably not going to be there as much in 13 too

618
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:20,240
you know i let you know go ahead yeah i was just saying i looked at the trailer for 13 too online

619
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,880
and uh i did notice it seemed like they were emphasizing even in the trailer that there was

620
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,360
more open world and open environments you could see in the maps they were not linear so i mean

621
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:34,320
that was one of the biggest you know complaints about 13 so i i could that was one thing i noticed

622
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:40,560
right off the top yep and uh one of the things that happened to me is that a monster joined my

623
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:47,440
party so i had i had a monster in my party i had my two humans and then like this monster suddenly

624
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,880
was in my party i don't know why it was you know i couldn't hear anything so i didn't know if it

625
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,160
was explaining dialogue but uh you know so and it depending on what paradigm you were in that

626
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,960
monster change like he was a little fire plant in commando mode or when you turn him to ravager he

627
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:07,120
turned into this big server thing huh so it was it was that was kind of cool and they introduced

628
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:11,360
this um and i didn't really understand it all that much once again because i was on the show floor

629
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,400
uh but it's like you've got a little mod with you and when enemies appear a little countdown timer

630
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:24,400
appears and however quick you hit the enemy uh that you know that determines if you get this

631
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,960
first hit or if they hit you first or whatever uh that was kind of interesting and then they did

632
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,000
some of like these cinematic events and live events and stuff uh while you're just walking

633
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,560
around and you know you can still walk around and like the camera will change to show something

634
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:47,040
happening hmm so it was kind of cool um you know i'm you know i'm sold on it but you also like 13

635
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:53,680
right what you also like 13 and a lot of you also like 13 though right and a lot of people didn't

636
01:00:53,680 --> 01:01:00,720
yes i like 13 so you know you keep that in mind when i say that that i you know since i like 13

637
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:05,840
you know i like 32 i like what they added to it but it is you know the core gameplay of the

638
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:10,560
paradigm shifting all that stuff that's that's still there 13 it didn't change at least not what

639
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:16,160
i saw um do you think that maybe there's enough there to kind of squelch the haters a little bit

640
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:26,000
oh no haters are gonna hate all right sounds familiar gamershateeverything.com right that's

641
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:34,160
right okay exactly um so let's see i'm trying to think of what else i kind of walked by and got to

642
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:41,760
see it was i was running around and stuff um i did go into atlas's booth a little bit in the

643
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:47,840
little meeting room area that was open so i could get into it um and they were showing uh rock of

644
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:54,720
ages which is the only one rock of ages and they were showing catherine and they were talking about

645
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:59,040
other things but those were kind of the only ones they were showing um and i played rock of ages and

646
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:03,840
i'm it was it's kind of hard the thing about e3 that people don't realize is that a lot of times

647
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:09,840
they dump you in the middle of things and there's not always a tutorial and there's not always a guy

648
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,880
standing there telling you okay here's what's going on so i had no clue what i was doing it's

649
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,280
like it's a tower defense game and then it's katamari damasi but not really because it's not

650
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:25,280
tank controls and you're trying to break down another guy's castle and it was it was kind of

651
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,200
interesting i'm sure that i'd like it more if i played it you know knowing what i was doing

652
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,640
but um that one was kind of cool i didn't you know there was too many people for catherine

653
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:43,040
in the place was getting cramped so i didn't get to go in there um so uh trying to think of what

654
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:50,320
else did you do you remember seeing anything on my twitter that i've been missing no i i mostly

655
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,480
wanted to hear about skyrim though but that you were getting some feedback on twitter today any

656
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,960
good uh any good questions you were able to get answered for people on twitter at twitter.com

657
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,960
slash bobby blackwolf i i did i started answering questions and then loki actually answered them

658
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,760
better than i did because like they weren't they weren't giving me exact dates and he'd be like oh

659
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:17,600
no that's coming out on february 12th um one thing i didn't get to play this yet um but uh you know

660
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,920
a good colleague of mine shadow next gen he's actually sitting right across from me right now

661
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:29,520
howdy um he he was uh able to get in to see the demo of fable the journey oh we learned something

662
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:36,560
but not many people are talking about what's that the game is not on rails oh it sure looked like it

663
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:43,440
was on rails okay okay it sure looked like it but according to mr molyneux who apparently gave that

664
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,720
particular demo just because he had nothing else better to do he said it's not on rails and you

665
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:54,480
know you can believe everything that molyneux says yeah it's always dead on accurate not not over

666
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:01,600
hyped at all so okay well then maybe maybe we'll just need to see more videos of the game in actual

667
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:07,040
well i wonder how do you move around yet you have the connect thing going on that's why i always

668
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:10,320
assumed a lot of connect stuff was on rails because like well if i'm not holding a controller

669
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,320
but i i also kind of thought connect was supposed to allow me to sit my big butt on the couch

670
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:21,920
with my controller yeah and maybe i'll maybe i'll lift my hand and wave it for something you know or

671
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:29,520
or at some point it could actually see fingers i don't know yeah now the game i did play today and

672
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,680
this is the reason i forgot about this because it was the first one i did this morning i went

673
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:39,200
to disneyland already i've already been to disney you went to play disneyland adventures huh

674
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:45,040
i did i played connect adventures with disney characters and that one the way the way that

675
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:49,520
you move in that and it's kind of interesting funny like in the overworld the the disneyland

676
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,600
area they actually have like the quest markers that look just like tabled like the little yellow

677
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:58,560
circles around things um but the way you move on that is you just put your hand down and you

678
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:04,800
start moving and then if you go right and left that's how you turn your character um and i did

679
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:12,720
an alice in wonderland video or mini game and uh it was um you remember the whitewater raft rafting

680
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:20,720
thing that was in connect adventures yes yeah it's that it's that with alice in wonderland characters

681
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:26,320
um so it basically you know when you guys are saying it's connect adventure with disney that's

682
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:31,840
pretty much what it is also i guess to me like i didn't get to do the the peter pan one but it's

683
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:36,160
been a while since i've been there but it's not a one-to-one representation of the ride at least i

684
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:43,600
hope the alice in wonderland ride is not you in a golf in a golf ball with alice hitting you and

685
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,760
sending you down and all these cards are trying to you know get in your way and you have to jump

686
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,560
over them i can guarantee you the ride is not like bobbie you will not have to worry if we do end up

687
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:58,080
going on that ride on friday we will not get pelt golf balls at you unless you want that full

688
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,640
experience because we are going for research purposes that's only on it's a small world at

689
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,880
least that's what you feel like by the time you get out of it when a small world breaks down the

690
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:13,760
puppets start pelting oh i've been in there when it during christmas all those people are actually

691
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,080
people who are trapped inside of the ride when it broke down and they were turned into little

692
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:26,720
mannequins and then you sing forever so was it was it enough to make you go gosh i i might actually

693
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,640
kind of want to get this game or were you like nah this is just the same crap with a new label

694
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,440
i i said gosh i might want to put this game on my gamefly queue

695
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:41,920
okay kind of in the middle all right get it from gamefly get my achievements then get out right

696
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:52,560
yeah fair enough yeah um so other than that i'm really i mean i talked to the playstation home

697
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:56,800
developers a little bit oh uh and i'm probably going to be doing an interview with them because

698
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,840
blender uh asked me about you know because there's this big freezing bug and they you know you

699

702
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:20,080
wide i'm like so you want to go on the air about that and they're like oh i'd love to

703

but i got to talk to pr so i may have this huge ps home interview tomorrow i'm soliciting questions

704
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,400
on twitter tonight some people have sent me some real good ones wow but i may be able to

705
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,640
report an interview there i know there's a lot of questions people have about playstation home

706
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:45,120
like when's it getting out of beta is it a google product yeah so um i think it's all data didn't

707
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:50,080
they take the word beta out of home no no when i launched it earlier today or not uh last night

708
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:54,000
you know how i went into playstation home it was completely on accident i met to go i meant to go

709
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,520
in the store and i accidentally like because my thumbs are fat like fred flintstone i went up and

710
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,240
i went into playstation home instead and i was like well shit now that i launched this i might

711
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,880
as well just kind of look around i clearly noticed the beta tag still on it and i was like hasn't

712
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:18,480
this been around for like two years now at least so uh and then uh i did kind of walk through the

713
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:26,080
indicate booth which is all the independent games where they had nerd twister as an actual twister

714
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:34,720
with a voice telling you where to put your next hand or foot on what color but the way that they

715
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:42,960
did it it's it's the i think they call it twister anapolis 5000 it's a race so everybody starts at

716
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:47,280
the end and i posted a picture of this on twitter and it says real long twister board and everybody

717
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:52,160
starts one end of the twister board and it says okay right hand blue and so you put your right

718
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:59,040
hand on blue and you know and you're trying to go forward and whoever makes it to the end first

719
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:05,440
without leaving one of their you know without waving one of your other hands uh they declared

720
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:11,280
the winner so that that was interesting and they had something else like what they had like it

721
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:16,000
looked like a four square court but i couldn't like they were throwing cups or something i don't

722
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,960
know what that was but i also saw in there i was just saying because the twister but the twister

723
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,920
was nerd twister what happened is that when you got to the very end the mat was pulled away and

724
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:34,880
you all fall into a cologne bath and that's how they kept e3 sane now that was not the craziest

725
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:41,040
thing that i saw in the indicator oh dear okay and i was i wanted to get a picture of this but

726
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:46,720
by the time i thought about getting the picture of it uh they were not playing it anymore it is

727
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:57,120
called a kiss controller a what where a kiss controller okay as in i thought he said a little

728
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:02,720
device you kiss this little device and that actually like they were shown like it does a

729
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:11,520
bowling game and the better kissers you are the better you bowl and you're actually kissing this

730
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:16,160
it is i i didn't want to approach it because i didn't want to you do it myself i wanted to

731
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:22,160
get a picture of somebody else doing it interesting wow they were putting those

732
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:28,960
booth babes to work weren't they i was like and there was this other game that had like a gas

733
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,120
mask and i didn't know what that was i don't know what that was but the guy was wearing like a full

734
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,280
on gas mask and playing you know might have been like some virtual reality type of thing as well

735
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:41,840
but it also tried to breathing or something i don't know maybe that was just to protect him

736
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,640
from the fanboy wink this clearly would have been the type of thing that used to be in kensha hall

737
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,520
yes awesome yeah that this stuff that stuff would have been intention because i mean the

738
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:59,040
indicate stuff so it was a lot of the independent games and stuff and then they had normal games in

739
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:04,480
there too that those were like on the edges you know that was the oh i've never thought of that

740
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:11,120
before well now bobby i know you've got one more day left at e3 and i know as part of your day

752
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:16,480
considering trying to get in the line for the vita but if it's really longer than the wii uu line

753
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:22,320
i think i'm gonna skip on that yeah miklotov waited four hours today so take it or leave it

754
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:28,720
i guess and he said it was worth it but of course then he continued to say i'm not waiting in that

wii u line so i don't know yeah yeah so so i don't know i may or may not do that i don't think so i

of what you guys have been able to watch and see you saw in those press conferences so maybe you're

816
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:13,520
news the guy who is behind uh he's a music producer of ddr recently right the 2011s new

817
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:19,040
ddr has been announced for we its name is dance dance revolution 2 its title concept is back to

818
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:24,160
basic the originality of ddr is the part where you play with your feet we have concentrated on that

819
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:30,000
part and created the content so that it will pursue the gameplay of traditional ddr ps not

820
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,680
only for the casual fans but we consider this title will be something that could be enjoyed by

821
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:38,880
core ddr fans for a long period of time as well we are aiming for the release of the title for this

822
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,520
fall we will do our best to respond to your expectations so please look forward for it

823
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:48,560
very interesting so now keep saying the ddr 2 on the we is going back to basics it basically

824
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:53,360
without saying it none of this balance board and flinging the wiimote around gimmicky shit he's

825
01:18:53,360 --> 01:19:01,440
saying it is back to feet because that's what makes back to the feet sure forget it is it a

826
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:10,240
new feature har where's my sad trombone i don't have a soundboard right now so dude you guys

827
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:16,720
harmonize that was awesome all right well some of the other stories i have just to go over quickly

828
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:21,520
some of these have developed in the pastio day or so uh that we didn't get got i feel like with

829
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,000
bobby's little like dust thing i was like god i learned more about that than i've read anywhere

830
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
or heard anything that was great but uh talking quickly about some of the other things that have

831
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,360
come up uh just in the past 24 hours a lot of it has to do with nintendo i don't know if you guys

832
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:38,320
heard about this and what you guys think make of this nintendo stock apparently went down five

833
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:43,120
percent yesterday after the wii u was revealed and my question you guys do you think that's a

834
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:48,480
big deal it was right after the keynote uh it went down to sixteen thousand nine hundred seventy yen

835
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:54,880
that's roughly 212 dollars but that is down five percent a low that the company has not seen since

836
01:19:54,880 --> 01:20:02,240
before the launch of the original wii is this damning for them or is this eh whatever i think

837
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:08,560
is people being fickle and then you know not thinking about it so but but if i'm not mistaken

838
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,880
most of the gamers i'm seeing posting on twitter i mean no offense guys but i don't think it's the

839
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,520
same people that are that are are following the uh japanese stock exchange or having a lot of

840
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,080
impact on that or even know what stock is apart from chicken now hold on hold on i won't go that

841
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:26,240
far i'm sure people have investments in things but it's a knee-jerk reaction you know the the

842
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:33,120
stockholders gauged what they thought the public reaction was it wasn't like oh my god it's the

843
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:37,920
second coming nintendo quick take our money except for a few people who were like take our money

844
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:46,080
i wasn't like that but i'll buy one so it dipped it's five percent i mean that's a significant drop

845
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:52,880
but over the next you know what year and a half two years demand will build nintendo will make

846
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,560
it happen they'll announce a price i think right now everyone's worried that this thing has to be

847
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:01,600
expensive they'll announce a price it'll be reasonable they'll sell a hajillion of them

848
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,880
nintendo stock will be a hundred gazillion dollars and everything will be fine for nintendo and more

849
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:11,280
fictional amounts well you know uh one thing that i did read about price is that even though

850
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,680
nintendo has not said anything i guess there's been hints from things like you know conversations

851
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:22,160
with executives indirect it will not be out for 250 oh no so we're looking at least probably

852
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:28,000
299 for this thing if not maybe even jumping up 349 or something well with all the competition

853
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:37,360
you know out there at what is it sub 200 now for a 360 oh yeah and and 200 bucks for the top end

854
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:46,880
360 or ps3 you gotta wonder how far nintendo can push that without seeing the uh the competition

855
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:51,920
gets some some bump from it uh now speaking of stock and i wanted to mention this but i'll let

856
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:59,040
the chatters say it because uh they said it too chat.org.com zappy says stocks fluctuate not a big

857
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:04,320
deal apple went down too after worldwide developer conference that's that's the first thing in my mind

858
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:09,360
is that well don't these things usually dip after apple press conferences and especially when all

859
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,600
the stuff happened with the antenna you know and their little apology press conference they did

860
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:18,160
with that i'm sure stock dips for them a lot too but they they're apple and they're still doing

861
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:23,280
just fine all these years later yeah they're making a couple bucks just a couple bucks not

862
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:27,600
doing too bad now several people in chat have mentioned this and uh black wolf's now saying

863
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,280
he's in chat now kind of cooling off with the listeners they're talking to them uh did you

864
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,600
guys cover that nintendo announced that they were ditching friend codes i had not heard that until

865
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,280
i walked into studio somebody posted it in chat earlier but apparently nintendo will be ditching

866
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:48,000
friend codes for the wii u good finally applause good job that's one way to get the hardcore gamer

867
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:54,160
base back that's smart i wonder if they've said much more about online let me look tiger claws

868
01:22:54,160 --> 01:23:07,280
giving us a little link here so we can take a peek let's see i'm going right now to this story

869
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:13,600
at mtv multiplayer blog because nintendo or mtv is all about the video games i know what's that

870
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,000
about actually i hear i don't read a whole lot of these big blogs but i hear the mtv ones pretty

871
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,320
good i just i don't have time there's the knees in action well yeah that's the whole super mario

872
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:29,040
brothers me yeah they were talking about i think it's cute let's see um on hand at e3 ubisoft

873
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:34,560
producer adrian blunt according to him the day of friend codes are gone demonstrating ghost recon

874
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:42,800
online for the wii u um i asked him equivalent to a gamer tag on xbox live yeah exactly he said uh

875
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:47,520
what else is there there's a few things on that the first is the ability for individuals to make

876
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,240
accounts rather than a machine having an account each individual user has an account so

877
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:58,400
that's an account uh he continued saying also the ability to easily find friends rather than using

878
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:02,720
friend codes which we've had in the past we're able to connect players in a much easier way

879
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:07,360
which allows us to have a community that's playing together in the game blunt wasn't willing to get

880
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,200
more specific about the online functionality you know what that sounds like to me remember a couple

881
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:16,240
weeks ago on the show we were speculating that the system tied into facebook somehow i don't

882
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:23,120
like exactly facebook but i bet you anything this whole like find your friends online is going to be

883
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:28,480
some type of maybe that's where the nintendo stream comes in folks maybe the nintendo stream

884
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:34,720
is the online component and the stream is so and so has been playing super mario we and so and so

885
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:39,440
just got caught and catch me i see dan laughing over there you think i'm full of it or oh no no i

886
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,120
was laughing about the fact that nintendo has products called the we and the stream

887
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:47,520
but now now that i think about it hearing that i'm like oh the nintendo stream that would make

888
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:52,880
perfect sense it's like you know funny it's what aol aol calls it the live stream right there um

889
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:59,040
updates and stuff yeah yeah so now you can make a stream which i don't use of course i'm i'm

890
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:03,280
obviously the nintendo stream thing was like total fanboy wank speculation i don't think there was a

891
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:09,040
lot to back that up but i'm just having fun with the what ifs but i i still think the facebook

892
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:14,960
concept of nintendo record i i got mildly curious and there are already a full page of search

893
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:22,160
results for weu fan pages uh tiger claw in our chat says i bet the gamer tag thing nintendo

894
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:27,520
has coming is tied to your club nintendo account your club nintendo account has a username that's

895
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:34,080
definitely possible um sure why not why not you have a database you own nintendo hardware there

896
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:42,080
you go well that sucks because i didn't get the name i wanted then bitches and frisbee says oh

897
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:47,840
shit more facebook like crap you know it's one of those things that could be done very well or very

898
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:52,720
crappy i mean how vague is that but seriously like i hear facebook i don't necessarily think that has

899
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:57,680
to be crap because i think a lot of us think of facebook crap as my feed filling up with come play

900
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:02,880
farm bill with me and you know and you can hide that crap and so and so filled out a survey and

901
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,840
said something about you hide yeah exactly hide no i do that too but it's just frustrating that

902
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:14,000
bullshit shows up in the first place yeah but if nintendo were to somehow kind of contain all that

903
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,640
a little better might be interesting i'm ignoring all those fucking people anyway

904
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:25,440
again the phones are open if you do want to call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on skype

905
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:30,320
is orange lounge radio um if we don't get any calls i'll kind of close quote unquote with this

906
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:36,800
story the weu reel that was showing off some of the third-party games this has been igniting the

907
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,960
internet today is apparently using 360 and playstation 3 footage and a lot of people are

908
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:49,600
going fail nintendo oh nintendo why didn't you tell people this is 360 ps3 you're be it you're

909
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:57,520
lyin nintendo and uh i'm kind of thinking is this really a big deal like i can't believe like i kind

910
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:05,280
of figured it was pc or 360 footage because i don't know the system's a year away i know right

911
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:10,080
but they've got the licenses for it they've and keep in mind for all the third-party stuff it's

912
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,600
probably what they've been provided by the developers absolutely right absolutely right

913
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:20,240
and i bet a lot of these things were a lot of these deals were probably sealed a month a month

914
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:26,000
two months ago very short time yeah these games are concepts still i and i can tell you this just

915
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:32,080
okay and this is from designer when you're working for a client and you say okay well you

916
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,560
want your want me to advertise this product for you i need some of your images they will send you

917
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:42,640
what they have of the item they don't care how big it is they don't care what it originally was on

918
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:48,240
they're just sending you pictures of the item what you know their pr has approved so

919
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:54,640
you get you know you get what they give you whatever you're nintendo how stupid can you be

920
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:01,360
seriously it's i know exactly what you're saying i remember back in like the genesis days and the

921
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:05,760
atari days where they'd show a screenshot of a game and it'd be for all these systems and you

922
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,560
know it was the the screenshot of the best looking version but nintendo's out there to make a

923
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:16,320
statement nintendo's out there to say this is our system and this is what it could do okay fine do

924
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:22,960
what you got to do put the put the code on your pc mock-up of of the wii u and play the game and

925
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:29,520
hope that it runs and if it runs great put it on your video don't throw these pictures out into the

926
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:35,680
world and be like this is what our system will do and then like a day later be like oh by the way

927
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:43,360
yeah that that's that's the competition system no no at least don't admit it lie you're nintendo

928
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:47,840
you've lied before dungeon buster says they're placeholders to give the crowd an impression of

929
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:53,600
what it could do right exactly i understand that i have a problem with that you have a problem with

930
01:28:53,600 --> 01:29:00,480
everything no i don't i'm not mad i have a problem with you yes of course you do i it it wasn't i

931
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:05,760
mean the smarter thing to do would have been to put in super tiny print in the bottom corner like

932
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:13,360
conceptual video based on existing game footage or something you know something just to cover their

933
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,640
ass whatever but they didn't do that they put those pictures out there they put the pictures

934
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:21,040
especially you know the one the one game in there that really got a pop was when ninja guy den showed

935
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:26,480
up right and everybody was like oh fuck it's ninja guy den and it's on the wii u and it looks really

936
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:31,840
really cool yeah you should have known that was the ps3 version of the 360 version kids the one

937
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:37,520
that kind of left me like okay maybe it wasn't smart to do that was the ghost recon where they

938
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:42,000
were showing like the scope and it gave you that impression that somebody was using their little

939
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,120
wii u controller as the scope like it just that's what it looked like to me but it was off in the

940
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:54,160
360 version of the ps3 version but if it's true about the guts of this machine it's gonna be

941
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:59,520
basically a 360 with some extra little frills maybe a boost in the ram a boost in the shading

942
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:04,960
graphical components of it and so forth i mean nintendo's going all in that their system has to

943
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:11,920
be at least as good as the 360 or the ps3 systems that have existed for five years now so i think

944
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:16,640
it's safe to say their system will be graphically capable of more than that absolutely it's going

945
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:21,680
to at least be this level of graphics this generation and that is why they showed they did

946
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:27,840
show that little you know for what it's worth that little random ass asian flower face

947
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:34,560
asian flower flying in the bird into the the the pool and everybody went shit what is that looks

948
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:40,640
really good that was the wii u that doesn't exist anywhere else well that was the wii u's

949
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:47,360
development system right so you know is is a high spec pc so and if and if i see okay well that's

950
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:52,240
capable then i'm sure they can pull off the 360 ps3 back in the day when the when the playstation

951
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:58,400
demo disc was out and it had all the ducks and you know all over the water and that t-rex and

952
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:02,560
the t-rex and when everyone's like oh wow that's neat how many games did we get that really look

953
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,760
like that until the end of the playstation's life true well right it's just that kind of thing you

954
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:13,600
know it's it's all it's so early people are people are obsessing over the tiniest detail of a system

955
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:18,560
that's a year and a half away and will change and will not be the same when it comes out it'll be

956
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:23,760
better it'll be better than the stuff that's out there now well it can't not be because you cannot

957
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:30,880
buy graphical components that are as weak as the stuff that's in the ps3 and the 360 now it doesn't

958
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:36,960
exist they're gonna be better they're not gonna be next generation better they're going to be peak

959
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:43,680
of this generation better that's how nintendo rolls it's a bridge i didn't you know this whole

960
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:50,400
like generation to generation nintendo has basically said with this that they they're

961
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,800
not following that rule they're just following what the markets want or what have you

962
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:05,760
what was that uh from the chat room colibri for yeah that was me that was jamie um i i kind of

963
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:11,600
though one of the fears that i have is that it's gonna pull a dreamcast that since it's coming out

964
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:16,480
well before other systems of uh of this nature

965
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,160
do you think that it might actually end up shooting itself in the foot no because it's

966
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:29,840
nintendo and sega only ever really had sonic you know i mean and i'm saying like as far as like

967
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,160
catching and getting people and drawing them in and so forth i mean if nintendo's launching with

968
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:38,400
the smash brothers game they got nothing to worry about nintendo's not launching with the smash

969
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:46,480
brothers game it won't be out until that system's uh first holiday season interesting which will be

970
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,520
the season i think the only system that ever launched with the smash brothers game at least

971
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:54,880
close to launched was the cube right which by the way we found out today you won't be playing that

972
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:59,600
on the wii u because the wii u has taken out the game cube compatibility that's right i you know

973
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,120
what we've got a game cube don't care i know i'm kind of like that i'm not too surprised about

974
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,680
that because nintendo usually doesn't do backwards compatible two generations back it's kind of like

975
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:13,360
your ds your ds 3ds or whatever won't play gameboy advance games you know they took that out way back

976
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:20,640

1007
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:33,440
you ronma after that presentation and my friends going nuts on twitter about about their pre

1008
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:40,080
about their presser we kind of came to agreement that nintendo is that abusive girlfriend that you

1009
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:45,920
always take back just thinking that things are going to be different the next time around there

1010
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:51,200
is genuine concern in the chat room what will happen to black luigi he will be replaced by

1011
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:57,280
shadow the hedgehog oh my god that's trading down really really really far

1012
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:06,240
and i'm a sega fan my shadow really at least be knuckles

1013
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:13,040
dan if it's any consideration is this a black thing when i walk into a block brother stay

1014
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:19,520
black let him talk look dan if it makes you feel any better joe vidya will kick my ass

1015
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:25,440
when she sees me dressed as shadow because she is not a shadow fangirl well she's more of a sonic

1016
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:31,040
and tails fangirl joe vidya three more times for the rest of us all right uh i i gotta talk more

1017
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:35,840
about why why this nintendo hatred what about when i i have to admit i loved it when reggie

1018
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:43,120
came out and we've said this before and said gamers want this and they want this so whatever

1019
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:53,280
you guys are confusing but here i don't know what gamers he's listening to but i didn't ask for a a

1020
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:59,840
six-inch android tablet with a hacked classic controller on each side i had one of those

1021
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:05,120
i just want one of those as a system you don't want to put it on your table and play othello

1022
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:14,000
no that would be awesome like ben heck to make it what about though the fact though rama that

1023
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:19,520
we are still a year away i mean the reason why i'm i'm still kind of like it was all right their

1024
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:24,560
presentation was fine i'm not like super excited about it i'm gonna buy one anyway because i'm a

1025
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:30,080
consumer whore and i buy them all and help but i'm like we're not really gonna see this system

1026
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:36,240
for another year maybe by then they'll actually get their shit together so are you basically

1027
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:44,240
giving your abusive girlfriend a year to shape up or ship out i suppose so but it's okay because

1028
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:52,160
i will be i will be marrying its younger sister the 3ds ah so the 3ds you were a fan of all the

1029
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:59,040
stuff you saw there okay yes uh mario kart yes even i am a mario kart whore like nobody else's

1030
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:05,840
business that that's a given and i missed super mario but i went back and watched a trailer for

1031
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:12,640
it and i said this is the mario game i've been looking for a 3d platformer that plays like 2d

1032
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:17,440
but it's three this is what i wanted right i will sit here and play that i'm not too fond it's

1033
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:25,200
called super mario but hey whatever i think it might still be a working title so it seems so it

1034
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:30,720
seems to me that you've got this uh relationship with the big sister but really you just want to

1035
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:38,880
sleep with the little sister well well yeah that's why i have a ds okay wow all right

1036
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:46,000
well rama any other closing thoughts on e3 before we let you go uh let's see then microsoft was a

1037
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:53,520
bit of a snore sony had me with with the vita and i'll say this right now yes the vita with 3g

1038
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,960
powered by at&t it's gonna be 299 but i'm telling you when it comes out you'll be able to get it

1039
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:07,040
for 99.99 with a two-year contract mark my word that's not that's not how they sell ipads though

1040
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:13,520
that's how they sell iphones ipads iphones netbooks with 3g hell it worked for the taco

1041
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:18,880
didn't it well kind of yeah but we got ours for free i think this is a relevant question

1042
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,640
rama since you are black luigi and we call you that just so people know we call you that because

1043
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:28,880
whenever you you you cosplay and you're black and you you dress up as luigi you make your way

1044
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:34,000
on camera no matter who's there and we always see you on tv oh it's black luigi there he is

1045
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:40,000
that's why you have that name and so tiger klon chat says rama what do you think of luigi's

1046
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,160
mansion too since you know it's a game starring luigi nintendo finally showing some luigi love

1047
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:51,680
i'm all for it because you know i've always said this i've always said that

1048
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:57,360
peach is nothing more than a than a whore because mario's always chasing after her to save her

1049
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:04,960
she doesn't freak out when bowser kidnaps her you know happens three times a month i know and look

1050
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:10,720
they're a coupe of kids we all know who the mother is you know we already know i feel like you have

1051
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:17,920
designed this really weird sick mario rp world while really really fucking high

1052
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:24,240
i actually i was so brett the time it was very loose and i said this to a friend of mine

1053
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:28,400
and it broke him and all my other friends are like holy shit that actually makes sense

1054
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:36,720
bowser you are the father all right anyway look luigi has a nice mansion

1055
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:40,960
a nice car his girl is in check he's got the good life i mean really

1056
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:50,240
but really luigi's mansion a 10 year old game coming back you're all for it yeah i actually

1057
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:53,760
believe it or not i actually liked the first luigi's mansion i thought it was a fun game

1058
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,560
hey i think it's a neat hey rama princess daisy don't want no scrub

1059
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:04,080
dad she has an eyeball in the back of her head all right rama we're gonna let you go

1060

1061
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:17,920
