0	20040	Tonight, August 7th, 2011, the Vita gets bumped to 2012, the Humble Indie bundle adds even
20040	29760	more games, and can you soon make a living playing Diablo 3?
29760	34520	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34520	39160	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39160	42960	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
42960	46640	First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
46640	47640	Hi.
47640	48640	How are you, Jamie?
48640	50280	I'm a culinary fucking goddess.
50280	51920	Congratulations.
51920	53820	What makes you a culinary fucking goddess?
53820	56320	Because I'm sharing one of my favorite recipes with you guys today.
56320	57320	What would that recipe be?
57320	58320	Monkeys' brains?
58320	59960	No.
59960	64560	While, you know, famous in Cantonese cuisine is rarely seen in the United States, no.
64560	65560	Touche.
65560	67440	Or in Washington, D.C., I should say.
67440	73160	No, they are blue potatoes, baked instead of fried, but baked with garlic, majorum,
73160	77320	oregano, Himalayan salt, pepper, and lots of-
77320	78320	Himalayan salt?
78320	81280	I asked for Mongolian salt, god damn it.
81280	84680	Lots of garlic, and plenty of Italian cheeses.
84680	86160	Oh, well, garlic salt always.
86160	87160	So eat some.
87160	89440	Okay, I will, I will, but I've got to set up the show first.
89440	90440	Okay.
90440	91440	All right.
91440	95880	Say hello as well to less of a culinary goddess, but still pretty awesome, tech master, Loki.
95880	96880	How's it going?
96880	97880	I'm good.
97880	99200	How are you, Loki?
99200	100200	Pretty good.
100200	101200	Yeah?
101200	102200	What's new with you?
102200	103200	Not much.
103200	105200	Has there been any culinary works in your life?
105200	110440	I know you used to do, you used to deep fry everything in good times.
110440	114400	Yeah, I haven't really done any deep frying in a while.
114400	116400	Well, that's too bad.
116400	117680	All right.
117680	122680	Well, let's start talking about games with you guys in our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
122680	125600	If you've never joined us for a live show, you should sometime.
125600	128840	Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf
128840	133560	show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
133560	135680	And yep, we have our chatters there.
135680	139120	Let's see, Tigerclaw says, Rob, did you just say monkeys?
139120	141160	Then you must have seen the new Planet of the Apes.
141160	143200	Nope, didn't see the new Planet of the Apes.
143200	145760	I heard it was number one in the box office, so it did way better than everyone thought
145760	146760	it would.
146760	147760	And they threw lots of number two.
147760	151280	I used to hate those movies, actually, growing up.
151280	155000	Like, I think my dad or my brother or somebody really liked those movies, and I always thought
155000	156080	they were terrible.
156080	158520	Like the Charlton Heston, I really don't like Charlton Heston.
158520	163920	Like, it has nothing to do with the politics side or the gun, my cold, dead hands on stuff.
163920	166440	Just, I just, God, I don't know.
166440	168960	Like something about him in movies just irritates me.
168960	169960	I don't know.
169960	172720	I'm sure there's a lot of people that would disagree, and that's fine.
172720	174000	Sometimes we disagree on this show.
174000	176720	But let's talk less about movies and talk about games.
176720	177760	We'll start off with Dark Soccer.
177760	179200	How was your gaming week?
179200	181480	Um, freaking Tiny Tower.
181480	182840	I blame you.
182840	184160	I'm up to floor 11 now.
184160	186440	It's actually kind of fun in a...
186440	189760	They talked about Mario twice.
189760	193880	I think Nintendo has a hidden agenda in that game.
193880	194880	How so?
194880	198240	Well, there's been two Mario references.
198240	200440	There's also, I saw Bobby posted on Twitter.
200440	204920	There's a Bad Dudes reference in there somewhere.
204920	208400	Like a bad enough dude to take on, or to save the president or whatever.
208400	210160	Was that line from the original Bad Dudes game?
210160	211160	Yeah.
211160	212400	It's pretty funny though.
212400	216960	And um, I actually didn't play any Groove Coaster.
216960	217960	That's too bad.
217960	218960	It's fine.
218960	219960	I played a lot of WoW.
219960	223800	Mostly because I've been forever alone.
223800	224800	My husband's gone.
224800	227400	He'll be back next week though.
227400	229560	You've been neglecting your consoles.
229560	230560	A little bit.
230560	234000	I actually was gonna go in and play the Saturn and I was like, I gotta do what to hook it
234000	235000	up?
235000	236000	Nevermind.
236000	237000	Alright.
237000	239920	There's actually an email that I was reading in the emails that I'll have to get to later
239920	242480	on that kind of asks you about playing the old games in the vault.
242480	243480	Yep.
243480	244480	Curious to hear about that later.
244480	245480	But we'll get to that in part B.
245480	247400	Alright, well Loki, how was your gaming week?
247400	249520	Um, it was okay.
249520	252000	I played lots of Groove Coaster.
252000	253520	That game's pretty fun.
253520	260840	It almost seems like it should be like a Q games game, but here it's not.
260840	264480	More Grand Theft Auto and more Earth Defense Force.
264480	269840	Actually, a lot of Earth Defense Force this week, which is kind of cool.
269840	271800	Leveling up my tactical guy.
271800	279520	We finished going through, well I had already gone through all the, was it like normal mode
279520	285980	or whatever, and my coworker hadn't though, so we played through that again, and now we're
285980	288760	starting hard again.
288760	294600	So I'll level up my tactical guy a little bit more, I think he's level 5 right now.
294600	300000	Do want to start leveling up some other characters, but haven't had time.
300000	301000	So that's pretty much it.
301000	305600	Oh, and now of course the tiny tower, because I have to join the cult that is the tiny tower.
305600	306600	Are you in Game Center?
306600	307600	No, you don't use that.
307600	308600	Yeah, I use that.
308600	309600	You don't have to have me on there.
309600	311560	Oh no, I do have you on there.
311560	313800	You are the only person that's on my Game Center.
313800	318200	I don't see your tower yet because you didn't start playing until like today, so I got it.
318200	319200	Yes.
319200	320400	Alright, my gaming week.
320400	323600	I picked up the Humble Indie Bundle, which I know is going to come up in the show later,
323600	327120	so I'll talk more about the bundle itself when it comes up in the news later.
327120	331360	But one of the games in the Humble Indie Bundle has been taking up a lot of my time, and that's
331360	332360	because I think it's terrific.
332360	336940	It's a terrific game, and it's one of those games, it's been brought up on the show before,
336940	340440	and I distinctly remember somebody had called in at the end of the year last year to say
340440	344240	that this was their favorite game of the year, and I was like, oh, I'll have to check that
344240	347560	out at some point, you know, and amongst all the other games I tried to fit in in a day,
347560	349760	I just never got around to it until now.
349760	355560	But now that I play this game, it's just like taking up all my time that I'm not playing
355560	373640	like WoW or an MMO or something, and that's VVVVVVVV.
373640	377520	I mean, this game could have been on the Commodore 64, that's obviously kind of the style they're
377520	384660	going for, but the music adds so much to it.
384660	386700	because the music is amazing in the game.
386700	387920	It's all chiptune type stuff.
387920	390480	If you like the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack, Super Meat Boy,
390480	392540	that type of stuff, you'll love the soundtrack to this.
392540	395560	And obviously it takes a lot of influences
395560	397020	from more recent gaming.
397020	399380	I think if you like Super Meat Boy,
399380	400760	this type of game's right up your alley
400760	405120	because it's about dying over and over and over again
405120	407040	on a level until you get it just right.
407040	408640	But then there's that whole exploration
408640	412600	and open world sense of the game
412600	415560	that you can kind of go rescue your friends in any order.
415560	417440	That's kind of where VVVVV gets its name
417440	419520	is it's you and all the friends that get lost on the,
419520	420700	you know, the spaceship blows up
420700	422260	and pieces are all over the planet
422260	423400	and all your friends are lost
423400	424960	and you gotta go around and kind of find them
424960	426320	and rescue them.
426320	428280	And some of the areas are really hard.
428280	431080	And each area kind of has its own little like trick.
431080	433260	Like even though the main point of the game
433260	434880	is push button flip gravity,
434880	439280	which is much more involved than it would sound.
439280	441160	Like some, like one dungeon
441160	442880	or whatever you want to call it that I was in
442880	444160	had trip wires.
444160	445360	And whenever you hit the trip wire,
445360	446740	the gravity automatically flipped.
446740	448560	And so you really had to kind of like
448560	450360	maneuver your character to hit trip wires
450360	451900	sometimes sequentially to get through the room
451900	453240	without landing on spikes.
453240	455760	Another area I was in was all about
455760	458020	warping from one side of the room to the other.
458020	460240	Like the only way to escape a room
460240	462240	would be from one predetermined exit.
462240	463720	Kind of like think of like the infinite maze,
463720	465160	like in a Zelda map.
465160	466280	Remember old school Zelda maps?
466280	468240	You had to go like up, left, down, left
468240	469080	or whatever to get out of the maze.
469080	471440	You had to go up and up and up and up and up.
471440	474000	Kind of like that ish sort of thing.
474000	476040	Like that's where it gets its inspiration clearly.
476040	477240	But yeah.
477240	479240	Like the way you get to the graveyard.
479240	480220	Northwest, what was it?
480220	481200	Northwest, Southwest?
481200	482280	I think it's like up, left, down, left.
482280	483120	Yeah.
483120	483940	Yeah.
483940	486600	So yeah, I mean, clearly the game
486600	488840	takes its influences from more recent games,
488840	490540	but it's not old style.
490540	493120	And so obviously that adds kind of a charm to it
493120	497800	that I guess it all kind of just kind of makes a mood.
497800	498640	I don't know.
498640	501640	I honestly think if the game had just done new graphics,
501640	503240	it would have been horribly overlooked.
503240	506840	Like I think sometimes that whole little retro catch
506840	508360	kind of adds a lot to the game.
508360	509280	There's not just by the way,
509280	511420	the open world Metroidy part of the game.
511420	513520	There's also like time trial levels that you can play.
513520	517600	And you can play made up worlds.
517600	520160	Like there's like a little level packs in it and so forth.
520160	521280	So yeah.
521280	524120	Amazing deal because right now you could get this game
524120	525960	for a dollar if you wanted to.
525960	527820	I think you're kind of cheap if you do,
527820	529360	but I understand some people are broke
529360	530960	and in school and what have you.
531820	533160	It's honestly,
533160	535280	if you miss the Humble Indie Bundle altogether,
535280	536880	it's worth the $10 on Steam.
536880	537720	I think so.
537720	538560	Especially if you like,
538560	541420	like if you like Super Meat Boy and those types of games,
541420	544200	retro fan, this game's right up your alley.
544200	545760	I bought it when it was two bucks.
545760	546600	Oh, nice.
546600	547440	During the Steam sales?
547440	548280	Way back.
548280	549100	Way back.
549100	549940	I've had it for awhile.
549940	550780	Cool.
550780	551600	Yeah.
551600	552440	It was really good.
552440	553280	It's a great game.
553280	554100	So yeah, that was taking up a lot of my time this week.
554100	555360	I played some of the other stuff in the bundle.
555360	556640	I played Cogs for a little bit,
556640	558040	which is kind of like a puzzle game.
558040	559360	That's all about,
559360	561240	like, you know, the sliding puzzles, right?
561240	564660	You know, you have these only keychains and stuff.
564660	566520	Yeah. You move, move a piece over.
566520	568240	Okay. Well imagine that now the pieces
568240	569800	have cog wheels on them
569800	572880	and you have like a spinning gear on one side of the board
572880	575120	and then a golden gear on the other side of the board,
575120	578040	or maybe like you're trying to power a propeller.
578040	579360	So it's just like, you have to move,
579360	580360	instead of making a picture,
580360	583840	it's like the dual puzzle of line up the wheels, right?
583840	586520	So that way it powers the machine.
586520	589560	It's kind of got that whole like steampunk-ish vibe,
589560	590400	but not really, I don't know.
590400	594160	It's very, very puzzle-y interface and so forth.
594160	595960	So I, yeah, that was, that was fun.
595960	598040	So those are kind of the big ones I've checked out.
598040	599400	Otherwise, most of the same stuff,
599400	601200	Warcraft, Final Fantasy 13,
601200	603040	randomly played Wipeout this week.
603040	605520	I don't know, just wanted to play F-Zero
605520	606760	and didn't feel like cooking up the GameCube.
606760	607880	So I'm like, oh, let's play Wipeout.
607880	609400	It's about the next best thing.
610500	611820	Yeah. There you go.
611820	613400	That was my gaming week.
613400	617040	So let's get into some gaming news.
617040	618400	After I mentioned real quick,

639280	640320	It's just free.
640320	641140	Question for you.
641140	641980	Yes.
641980	642820	What did you think?
642820	643660	Of?
643660	644480	The dish.
644480	645320	Oh, what you made?
645320	646640	Am I a culinary goddess or what?
646640	648180	I haven't, well, I've been talking most times,
648180	649200	so I haven't been able to really eat it,
649200	650600	but it's really good.
650600	651440	I like it.
651440	652840	See everybody, I'm awesome.
654200	656520	I don't wanna inflate your ego too much.
656520	658280	You're gonna have to go on Hell's Kitchen or something
658280	659120	and get your ego kicked out of it.
659120	663440	No, because I would punch what's-his-face.
663440	666800	Be like, you're much nicer to the people on MasterChef.
668980	670600	Gordon Ramsay.
670600	671800	All right.
671800	674120	Let's see, going to the chatroom
674120	675920	at chat.orangelandraday.com.
675920	677480	Spazinator PC in chat says,
677480	679080	if there was a sequel to VVVVVVV,
679080	682000	would it be called VVVVVVVV2?
682000	682840	No.
682840	684160	VVVV70s or WWW?
684160	711920	I think it would probably be a letter repeated.
711920	714560	Ugh, I think I'd rather glue my forehead
714560	715960	to a donkey's ass.
715960	717280	An ass's ass.
718640	721240	It's neater than it sounds.
721240	722480	I don't think this,
722480	724520	it really depends what types of games you're into.
724520	726120	If you like actiony type of games,
726120	728360	you're probably not gonna get so much out of cogs,
728360	730080	but there's some people that just, to kill time,
730080	732080	like to sit there and play a little puzzler.
732080	733720	Like, you know, some of you probably play
733720	736460	Plants vs. Zombies, Bejeweled, those are puzzlers.
736460	739040	This is kind of right up that same alley.
739040	740560	All right, there you go.
740560	742620	Chat.orangelandtrady.com if you wanna join us live
742620	743460	on this Sunday night.
743460	744980	Let's get to some gaming news.
744980	746860	We'll start off with Loki.
746860	747700	Ah, yes.
749060	750960	Apparently, the PlayStation Vita
750960	753140	will not be coming out this year.
753140	753980	Too bad.
753980	757040	At least, not over here in the United States
757040	759720	or North America or in Europe.
759720	762200	Instead, it'll be coming out in early 2012.
762200	764940	Of course, I'm assuming Sony being a Japanese company,
764940	768040	the Japanese will get theirs holiday, 2011.
768040	773040	But yeah, right now, no real reason given,
775320	780320	other than, you know, I don't know that they're delaying it.
782160	783200	I think it's a good idea,
783200	786760	because if it means either more units being produced
786760	788480	so that they don't have shortages,
788480	793480	or to have better games coming out at launch,
793720	796960	I mean, both of those things would definitely help them out.
796960	799120	And of course, they were asked
799120	800700	whether they'd be lowering their price,
800700	804280	because Nintendo did it on the 3DS,
804280	807900	they lowered their price to compete with the Vita.
807900	808740	They basically said,
808740	810880	we packed so much into the device
810880	812680	and made it very affordable,
812680	814000	there's no need to lower the price
814000	815980	just because somebody else happens to be
815980	818080	in the video game business
818080	820640	and decided that they were gonna lower their price.
821880	824760	And honestly, there is a lot of components in the Vita,
824760	828120	but if that shit isn't gonna sell at launch,
828120	829460	they will lower the price.
830640	832500	That's just the way things are.
834560	838120	Something else though, got delayed to early 2012 as well.
838120	839400	That'd be Twisted Metal,
839400	842200	which was supposed to be coming out in October,
842200	845800	and now it's early 2012.
848400	851200	They basically said, you know,
851200	854880	late game is only late until it ships.
854880	857680	A bad game is bad until the end of time.
858960	859800	Great quote.
862100	864400	If we shipped Twisted Metal tomorrow,
864400	866680	going off the response from folks who have played it,
866680	869660	I assure you, it would never be a bad game.
872880	876320	But yes, they're spending the extra time polishing the game.
876320	881320	I can wait, it'll be awesome.
882040	883360	Yeah, that game has been in development
883360	885180	for quite some time now, hasn't it?
885180	886020	Yep.
887080	889420	So let's go back to the Vita being delayed.
889420	891280	What does it boil down to, the cost for delay?
891280	895200	It's parts, it's strategical, what's going on?
895200	897720	Because you kinda knew about this
897720	899820	before the rest of the internet did, didn't you?
899820	900880	Yes.
900880	901700	So what's up?
902680	904680	Nothing really, they didn't say.
904680	907520	They said it's 2012.
909400	912280	Part of me wondered if maybe they saw
912280	914540	what the 3DS was doing wrong.
914540	916120	And that was that the 3DS launched
916120	919440	without really having any good games at launch.
919440	922040	Debatable, I understand Street Fighter IV has its fans,
922040	923640	but let's face it, that was a port of a game
923640	925320	that had already been out for a couple years, right?
925320	929160	And if that's your strongest release title, something's up.
929160	932400	So maybe they were looking at that going,
932400	934880	well, what do we have coming out at launch on the Vita?
934880	936480	You know, if these developers aren't really ready
936480	938720	to put out all-star games, maybe now's not the time
938720	942800	to put out the Vita, because that was where my mind went,
942800	945440	is I said, well, maybe the Uncharted people
945440	947000	weren't ready to put out the game.
947000	948400	And if that's your biggest game
948400	949840	and that's gonna get delayed,
949840	951740	let's just delay the whole damn thing.
953400	954240	Could be.
954240	956080	Let's call the whole thing off.
956080	958280	Apparently, so.
958280	963280	All right, well, going to chat.orangelaunchradio.com,
963640	965320	Black Lab is in chat tonight saying,
965320	967200	I can tell Rob started talking mid-chew.
967200	968640	Hey, I gotta eat sometime.
969520	971600	When I got something to say, I'm gonna say it.
974400	975880	Let's see, Brakeman in chat says,
975880	978920	I got a PSP at full price, if only I'd waited.
978920	981560	Well, here's a newsflash.
981560	984000	You could wait to get a Vita too,
984000	985380	but it's probably gonna take a long time
985380	986760	for the price to drop on that,
986760	989640	especially if it comes out in the first part of next year.
990640	994520	There could be a small price drop at the end of next year
994520	998920	going into holiday 2012, but that's not for sure.
998920	1000200	I'd be interested in the Vita
1000200	1003760	if they had Saints Row on it, or Grand Theft Auto.
1003760	1004680	Might just be a matter of time.
1004680	1006980	Either one of those is very interchangeable,
1006980	1008640	or Earth Defense Force.
1009820	1013020	Any of those three, I would definitely be down for a Vita,
1013020	1016020	but as of right now, I've seen how much
1016020	1020800	I play my 3DS, which is not at all.
1021920	1023520	So I just don't need another system
1023520	1026960	cluttering up my bank account.
1026960	1028920	All right, well let's talk about the other handheld,
1028920	1032200	the 3DS, oh, before we get to 3DS actually,
1032200	1033240	let me ask one more question.
1033240	1035400	Does this change your opinion at all about the Vita?
1035400	1037020	And I asked this to chat too.
1037020	1039160	Does it change your opinion thus far at the Vita?
1039160	1042160	Does it change the fact whether you want one or not?
1042160	1043600	For me, I'll start.
1043600	1045340	No, it doesn't really change my opinion of the Vita.
1045340	1048200	In fact, I actually kinda say, you know what?
1048200	1049760	If you're not ready, then that's cool.
1049760	1052640	Take your time till you've got a really solid launch lineup.
1052640	1055180	And B, the fact that the holidays
1055180	1057720	are gonna be killer anyway, I'm kinda glad
1057720	1060480	to not have to spend 250 bucks right now on a Vita as well,
1060480	1061720	because you know I'll have to have it.
1061720	1065580	So actually, I'm not so bothered by this.
1065580	1066480	What about you guys?
1066480	1067980	Loki?
1067980	1072360	I was kind of just warm about the Vita to begin with,
1072360	1075760	and nothing really stood out so far with the Vita
1075760	1078600	that says, I gotta have that system.
1078600	1080640	So until I see something like that,
1080640	1082840	then I don't really have to have that system.
1085540	1087240	It depends on finances.
1087240	1090360	I mean, the Vita looks nice, hooray.
1090360	1092600	But I hardly touch my PSP,
1092600	1095400	so why would I wanna touch the new one?
1095400	1097160	I really didn't play the PSP that much
1097160	1100600	except for Popolo Cross and Loco Roco.
1100600	1102760	There's gonna have to be those must-have games.
1102760	1105160	Yeah, it's really gonna be more of a matter of games.
1105160	1107040	I mean, even Dissidia wasn't really enough
1107040	1110080	to make me really wanna play my PSP.
1110080	1112780	But see, I got on board with PSP early
1112780	1115080	because the very first time I played Luminous,
1115080	1117160	I was like, oh my god, this is the best music puzzle game.
1117160	1119280	We had a PSP the day they came out.
1119280	1120240	Yeah, yeah.
1120240	1122360	And I love Luminous.
1122360	1125840	I remember playing it really drunk on my birthday,
1125840	1127960	playing Wendell's PSP.
1127960	1130880	Shining, shining, room is spinning.
1130880	1132000	Oh, I didn't even care.
1132000	1135800	There was a bunch of food, and I think I stopped for fire.
1135800	1138660	But I got to level 24 after, what,
1138660	1140540	that 25-ounce beer I drank.
1142880	1145320	But I mean, I've played stuff that I've liked,
1145320	1147480	but it's never been really enough to keep me.
1147480	1150400	I mean, I've taken it on trips and watched movies on it.
1150400	1154240	Now I have a netbook, so I watch movies on that instead.
1154240	1155920	Let's go to the chatters and see what they have to say.
1155920	1157260	Defective Candy in our chat room says,
1157260	1158640	kudos to them for taking the time
1158640	1161060	and trying to launch something solid instead of rushing it
1161060	1162200	like Nintendo.
1162200	1164240	SonicM88 says, Vita doesn't interest me.
1164240	1167120	I've never liked Sony's games.
1167120	1169720	Kitsune says, it may not carry all your favorite games yet,
1169720	1171560	but it definitely has a lot more than 3DS.
1171560	1173200	I'm psyched about the Vita.
1173200	1175760	Dungeonbuster says, doesn't really change my opinion either.
1175760	1177440	I have the same opinion that Loki does.
1177440	1179560	I just don't play handhelds all that much.
1179560	1182000	Mieglatov says, having played it at E3 this year,
1182000	1183400	it doesn't change my opinion.
1183400	1185400	Just makes me sad I have to wait longer.
1185400	1189120	Need sound shapes since it's like the Vita's luminous to me.
1189120	1190840	Spazinator says, I'd be interested in the Vita
1190840	1192420	if it'll print money, make me a sandwich,
1192420	1194920	and order me several slutty strippers every night.
1194920	1196480	You might be a little bit disappointed.
1196480	1199520	I don't think these slutty strippers will be in right away.
1199520	1203000	That could be in the 2.0 firmware though, so stay tuned.
1203000	1204880	Breakman says, it's a smart move for Sony
1204880	1206400	to move the Vita to next year.
1206400	1207700	They don't want to compare its sales
1207700	1209080	to the sales of the 3DS,
1209080	1211680	which I think will be one of the biggest Christmas gifts.
1211680	1215960	Interesting theory, maybe they did it to not compete
1215960	1217920	with the 3DS.
1217920	1220320	Maybe they want to hand this Christmas to Nintendo.
1220320	1223040	Maybe they're a little afraid of the competition.
1223040	1227220	Is that, does that sound too fanboy motivated or what?
1231480	1235100	I think it really just is a matter of putting out
1235100	1236780	a polished product because,
1237640	1239940	especially with the mistakes that Nintendo's made
1239940	1242320	with bringing the system out
1242320	1244880	and not having the right games for it,
1244880	1246540	that's really hurt their sales.
1247660	1250220	So I think that they're really just trying
1250220	1251060	to avoid that trap.
1251060	1254080	They've seen how it's bit Nintendo in the ass.
1254080	1256160	All right, well, let's move over and talk Nintendo then.
1256160	1258800	I was gonna move on and talk about the 3DS.
1258800	1261200	With the 3DS, there's some more comments
1261200	1263800	from Nintendo CEO, Satoru Iwata.
1263800	1265540	Of course, you all know who Iwata is.
1265540	1266880	He's the man at Nintendo.
1266880	1270840	He's talking about the 3DS and talking about
1270840	1273600	kind of the GameCube and how the two relates.
1273600	1276840	He said in an interview that the GameCube suffered
1276840	1278920	because Nintendo did not take opportunities
1278920	1280680	when they were available.
1280680	1282700	The general feeling within the company's management
1282700	1285060	is that the console had a chance to succeed,
1285060	1288640	but that the chance was not taken advantage of.
1288640	1290940	Iwata has said that the company learned its lesson
1290940	1294500	and that's why they did a price cut so soon after launch.
1294500	1296780	Interesting that they kind of brought up
1296780	1298700	the comparisons to the GameCube there.
1300540	1303500	Also, wanted to mention this with the 3DS price drop.
1303500	1305620	There's some rumors going around that Walmart
1305620	1308380	is going to drop the price early.
1308380	1311780	So if you wanna go to Walmart on August 9th,
1311780	1314940	that's the rumor anyway, they are supposedly dropping
1314940	1318720	the suggested retail price down a little early to the 170.
1318720	1321460	What this means is that you might be able
1321460	1323220	to get your cake and eat it too,
1323220	1325780	meaning if you can buy one of these things
1325780	1328500	in that window between the early price drop
1328500	1329780	and the price drop for everybody else,
1329780	1332000	quickly get it on the Nintendo eShop,
1332000	1334100	then you will be an early adopter.
1334100	1336100	So not only did you get the cheap 3DS,
1336100	1339380	but you got the $80 worth of games too.
1339380	1342060	So that's one way of working the system.
1342940	1346020	So I guess call your local Walmart or check.
1346020	1348380	Who knows, Nintendo may put the smack down on that though.
1348380	1350180	I don't know if they can.
1350180	1352180	Loki, I don't know if you know from the retail angle,
1352180	1353940	but could Nintendo stop this?
1353940	1356420	Like if Walmart wants to cut the price three days early,
1356420	1358020	can Nintendo stop that or no?
1358020	1362340	Well, here's a couple factors that they have in that.
1362340	1365480	One, whether there is map pricing on it or not,
1366420	1369820	which is the minimum advertised price.
1369820	1372280	So if they have map pricing in place on it,
1373980	1376420	it may prevent them from advertising it lower
1376420	1378740	than a certain amount.
1378740	1381100	Also, if they're being price protected on it,
1381100	1385140	any of those, fucking,
1385140	1390140	any of those units that they sold
1390180	1392360	prior to it dropping in price,
1392360	1394500	they don't get any of the money
1394500	1396420	from when it dropped in price.
1396420	1398520	So they would be eating the cost on that.
1400740	1403740	Now, I wouldn't see Walmart as a company doing this,
1403740	1408740	but I know that, and none of the people I know,
1408740	1411340	or work with in the industry do this,
1411340	1413340	but I know there's people out there to do that,
1413340	1415280	you can manipulate your price protection
1415280	1418420	by fudging the numbers, if you will,
1418420	1420420	and then saying, oh, I didn't really sell
1420420	1421540	as many units as I did,
1421540	1423460	and then you get the price protection,
1423460	1425320	and then you sold those units.
1427140	1427980	That's how you-
1427980	1428940	There's kind of ways to work this system,
1428940	1430780	but Walmart's probably too big to do that.
1430780	1433180	I wouldn't think they would be able to do that.
1433180	1436240	So, I don't know.
1436240	1437460	I don't think that they would be getting
1437460	1439500	any sort of special exception either,
1439500	1440940	but you never know.
1440940	1445080	Well, I mean, I think there's a very small group
1445080	1446580	that this would even really apply to,
1446580	1449740	because you're talking about people who won a 3DS,
1449740	1451460	who didn't already buy one,
1451460	1454140	who are really just waiting to seize an opportunity,
1454140	1456500	like it's like couponing or something.
1456500	1460060	You've got the extreme couponer crowd of video gamers.
1460060	1463260	I can't buy meat until Wednesday,
1463260	1464580	because then it's on sale.
1464580	1466800	Exactly, that's the crowd
1466800	1467940	that this type of thing calls to,
1467940	1469800	because that means you have to have $170
1469800	1471120	burning a hole in your pocket right now,
1471120	1473060	saying, I'm dropping it on a 3DS,
1473060	1474400	because I need to be an early adopter,
1474400	1476060	and I know I want a 3DS.
1476060	1478380	So, I don't know if that is really a whole lot of people,
1478380	1482120	but if it's you, start calling places on,
1482120	1483660	or even get out in the car,
1483660	1487180	and go to some different places on the 9th, what, Tuesday?
1487180	1489300	And I totally lost track of time.
1489300	1490380	Yes, that's Tuesday.
1490380	1493260	And go check out who might have dropped the price early,
1493260	1494100	because you never know.
1494100	1495980	And you have until, what, Thursday night
1495980	1497780	to connect that thing online
1497780	1500140	to be considered an early adopter.
1500140	1501820	Although, what's interesting is that
1501820	1503460	your system never really tells you
1503460	1505060	if you're an early adopter or not.
1505060	1506540	You just kind of have to hope that,
1506540	1507940	well, I connected to the eShop,
1507940	1510100	and, well, let's just hope I get lucky.
1510100	1512680	I downloaded a couple things from the eShop,
1512680	1515500	so I'm hoping that I'm considered an early adopter.
1515500	1516700	If not...
1516700	1520380	Rage, podcast rage.
1520380	1522220	It's pitchforks and torches.
1522220	1524020	Exactly, that's kind of where I'm at.
1524020	1527860	It's like, hey, wait, I have Zelda Color Game Boy
1527860	1530300	that I got for free, so clearly I had it during E3.
1530300	1533500	I bought this, like, was it almost day one or...
1533500	1534340	Was it day one?
1534340	1536100	I don't even remember when I bought that.
1536100	1538420	You bought, well, you had the Japanese 3DSs
1538420	1539620	like hecka early.
1539620	1540460	True.
1541480	1544540	But still, though, I had it almost like day one,
1544540	1548340	so I'm about to begin my fucking games.
1548340	1549360	I want my games.
1550260	1552780	I'm gonna come to your house.
1552780	1555100	All right, let's move on, Dark Sakura.
1555100	1555940	Twinbee.
1557420	1562140	So, it's going to be the next game after Urban Champion
1562140	1566600	to get the 3D Classic deal done to it for the 3DS.
1568300	1569700	Anyone remember Twinbee?
1569700	1571420	I love Twinbee.
1571420	1572740	Wasn't it, didn't it have a different name,
1572740	1573780	like Stinger or something?
1573780	1576140	Yes, it was Stinger over here on the NES.
1577120	1580080	I did do a review, by the way, of Daytona Twinbee, so.
1580080	1583800	Twinbee is basically a top-down shooter
1583800	1587020	with cutesy little Twinbee and Winbee,
1587020	1589520	and you shoot bells for your power-ups
1589520	1591800	and all kinds of neat stuff.
1591800	1594840	So, it's going to be out in Japan on August 10th,
1594840	1598640	and hopefully we'll have it soon after.
1598640	1600240	I mean, we don't have Urban Champion yet,
1600240	1601440	but maybe we'll get it.
1602440	1603340	But Twinbee!
1604360	1606200	Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
1606200	1607220	Why this game?
1607220	1609120	It seems interesting that out of, like,
1609120	1612560	all the 3D remakes they could do, we're in Twinbee.
1612560	1613400	I honestly...
1613400	1614400	You've got to admit, it's not really
1614400	1616180	the first title you think of.
1616180	1617640	I think Twinbee, though,
1617640	1619680	if you look how the levels are laid out,
1619680	1622960	I think Twinbee does make sense on a graphic,
1622960	1623880	from a graphic sense,
1623880	1625600	because you've got your clouds
1625600	1627520	with all the bells hidden in them,
1627520	1630200	you've got your bottom layer with, you know,
1630200	1632000	so you can actually move your...
1634640	1636160	The same way that it's Xevious, basically.
1636160	1638080	Yeah, basically the same thing.
1638080	1640120	But I think it would work for the game.
1640120	1641360	I think it would be cute.
1643080	1645360	All right, interesting.
1645360	1646240	Going back a little bit,
1646240	1647280	since we're a little bit delayed
1647280	1648360	between when we say something
1648360	1650000	and when the live listeners hear it,
1650000	1651520	because the encoding and everything,
1651520	1652560	Kaijuto in chat says,
1652560	1654600	no, you'll know you're an early adopter
1654600	1656920	because your eShop list will have a section for it
1656920	1659040	like the PlayStation Network store did.
1659040	1659860	Really?
1659860	1662280	But how do we know the non-early adopters don't see that?
1662280	1664360	Because we haven't gotten that far yet.
1664360	1666160	Could just be a place that's in the store
1666160	1667840	as like a heads up or something.
1667840	1668720	Who knows?
1668720	1669540	Zether in chat says,
1669540	1671880	I hope Twinbee isn't Japan only for the 3DS.
1671880	1673160	It's a good game.
1673160	1675340	I would imagine if there's money to be made,
1675340	1677140	why not come out here?
1677140	1679960	But of course, I don't know, the whole region...
1679960	1681960	This is Nintendo we're talking about.
1683080	1686120	And the same could be said of the last story, Xenoblade.
1686120	1686960	I don't know.
1688000	1688900	Zether in chat says,
1688900	1689740	the thing is,
1689740	1692680	Stinger was actually the second Twinbee NES game.
1692680	1697320	So who knows what they might do with this 3D remake?
1697320	1698940	I probably won't buy it.
1698940	1699780	No, I mean...
1699780	1701400	There's just too much.
1701400	1703320	Honestly, if I was gonna go buy Twinbee,
1703320	1706240	I'd hook up my PC Engine and play my HuCard.
1706240	1708080	And play a good version of Twinbee.
1708080	1709680	Not the old NES premium.
1709680	1712220	I'm not saying the NES version is crap,
1712220	1713800	but I could play a good version.
1713800	1716180	I've got multiples, so...
1716180	1717020	Honestly, what I would do
1717020	1718880	is probably just play Parodius instead.
1719920	1721920	All right, let's move on with more news.
1723020	1725960	So the Humble Indie Bundle 3
1725960	1727840	has taken in a good,
1727840	1731540	was it $100 million in the first week.
1731540	1736540	And they've had over 215,000 downloads already.
1737000	1742000	Of course, they've just expanded the bundle with Steel Storm.
1742320	1746080	And then of course the average price is just a little...
1746080	1748060	Well, at the time it was a little under five bucks.
1748060	1750120	Now it's just a little over five bucks.
1750120	1755120	And I guess Linux purchasers are paying a little bit more.
1755120	1758180	I had 11.62 as the average there.
1759920	1763200	Of course, they wouldn't just leave it there.
1763200	1766280	No, they're going to also
1766280	1769400	add Atom Zombie Smasher,
1769400	1770800	which is another free game
1770800	1772880	that they're gonna throw in there.
1772880	1777780	Also, if you buy the Humble Indie Bundle 3
1777780	1779120	over the average cost,
1779120	1781640	which is funny because it's been slowly creeping up.
1781640	1785820	I believe the last we checked was $5.69,
1785820	1790120	you can actually get the Humble Indie Bundle 2 as well.
1790120	1793300	So that's another six games thrown in there.
1793300	1794880	CRAN Physics Deluxe.
1794880	1798400	And yet it moves, VVVVV.
1798400	1803400	And then the set two was Braid Cortex Command Machinium.
1807640	1808960	I can't pronounce that shit.
1808960	1810540	Why can't I pronounce that shit?
1810540	1812980	Machinarium, I guess.
1812980	1813820	Machinarium.
1813820	1814640	Machinarium.
1814640	1815480	Thank you.
1815480	1818100	My mouth just didn't want to form the word.
1818100	1819700	It's like, bleh.
1819700	1822420	Okay, our mouth was mush for machinarium.
1822420	1823260	Yes.
1823260	1826260	Osmose and Revenge of the Titans.
1827300	1829220	You know it's a weird week at OLR
1829220	1831860	when I'm the one correcting people on pronunciation.
1831860	1832980	Like, what is up?
1833860	1836380	There's something, something is in these fries
1836380	1837500	the Dark Sakura made us.
1837500	1839620	Yeah, awesome.
1839620	1840900	Mouth numbing awesome.
1840900	1843560	I feel like suddenly it's that level in Yoshi's Island
1843560	1845460	where you touch fuzzy and you get dizzy
1845460	1846980	and all of a sudden it's like,
1846980	1849260	Loki's trying to read Machinarium and he's like,
1849260	1850180	Machinarium.
1852100	1852940	There's so much by the way.
1852940	1854160	What's that level?
1854160	1855000	Really?
1855000	1855960	Yes.
1855960	1856940	I'll get more dizzy.
1856940	1858500	Sounds fun.
1858500	1861900	She's totally, the garlic salt had crack in it or something.
1861900	1863480	I didn't use garlic salt.
1863480	1865260	I used garlic.
1865260	1866100	Oh, what was this?
1866100	1868140	Oh, it was like Himalayan salt.
1868140	1869500	Whatever.
1869500	1871100	Made with real Himalayans.
1872000	1872840	Anyhow.
1872840	1873660	Okay, back to the-
1873660	1875720	Made from the tears of Himalayans.
1875720	1877180	Back to the Humble Indie Bundle,
1877180	1880820	which may or may not be available in Himalaya.
1880820	1883020	How long are they selling this for anyways?
1884700	1887460	I think it's only for about another week.
1887460	1889500	I don't, it's a limited time.
1889500	1892060	I know that cause I totally missed it last year
1892060	1893740	cause I don't know, I was drunk or something.
1893740	1896140	I just totally missed it and I meant to get it
1896140	1897220	and I never did.
1897220	1899660	But this year, you betcha I got it,
1899660	1901220	especially because I'd heard such great things
1901220	1903060	about VVVVV and I wanted to try it for myself
1903060	1904060	and I'm really glad I did.
1904060	1905160	And I'm telling you guys,
1905160	1907340	for as many games as you get with this,
1907340	1911820	if you put in six bucks, you've got to get it.
1911820	1916140	So even if you're like starving student, whatever,
1916140	1918140	at least pay a dollar.
1918140	1920740	Go without a soda today and pay a dollar
1920740	1924320	for just the Humble Indie Bundle three games.
1925180	1926860	It's so worth it.
1926860	1929260	And the money goes to a good cause.
1929260	1931580	It goes to wherever you want it to go to.
1931580	1933900	You can split it between the different companies
1933900	1934740	and so forth.
1934740	1936380	I'm telling you, don't kick yourself later
1936380	1937740	when you miss out on this.
1937740	1939080	And don't be a cheapskate either.
1939080	1940480	If you can afford more than a dollar,
1940480	1942900	then give them 10 or whatever.
1942900	1944060	Give them as much as you would pay
1944060	1946980	for an Xbox Live Arcade game or what have you at least.
1946980	1949220	Cause I think the games are really worth it.
1949220	1952360	And I'd like to see a Humble Indie Bundle part four.
1953300	1955340	So what's that only day and a half.
1955340	1957460	It looks like, better hurry.
1957460	1958680	Day and a half.
1958680	1960820	You can have all the money go to charity if you want.
1960820	1962520	That's the cool thing about it.
1962520	1965100	So you better hurry up on that,
1965100	1966800	especially those of you listening to the podcast.
1966800	1969500	If it's after Monday night, you might already be screwed,
1969500	1972220	but you really got to check that out.
1972220	1977220	So, all right, moving on to something less humble.
1977820	1980520	And wouldn't you know it, it's another story about Capcom.
1980520	1983820	Like I hate to keep kicking these guys week after week,
1983820	1986540	but something is up with the management at Capcom.
1986540	1989340	Like something has really changed
1989340	1990980	and not in a good way at Capcom.
1990980	1992300	And wait until you hear this.
1992300	1994100	Like we're going from Humble Indie Bundle,
1994100	1995660	pay what you want to this story.
1996840	2001100	Capcom is testing the waters in Japan on something.
2001100	2005420	It's a demo of a game called Nazu Waka Yakata.
2005420	2007900	It is a interesting title.
2007900	2009980	It doesn't use buttons on the 3DS.
2009980	2012060	It relies on sound and the microphone.
2012060	2013900	There's like this little trailer
2013900	2015940	that I'm playing in studio for the games.
2015940	2017900	We can kind of look at it here,
2017900	2020100	get the sense of what this game's all about.
2021580	2022420	I guess you-
2027860	2029540	I wonder if this is kind of like C-Man
2029540	2030580	or something where you talk
2030580	2033500	and interact with the on-screen characters.
2033500	2034900	It's kind of the sense I get.
2036180	2037180	It's like a creepy dude on screen.
2037180	2038820	It's a ghost.
2038820	2043820	He has no feet, he's a ghost.
2044060	2046820	It's like you kind of like explore these rooms and talk.
2047780	2048820	So that's the game, right?
2048820	2050740	I don't know if it's something that's planned
2050740	2051580	to come out here yet.
2051580	2052420	Creepy children.
2052420	2053380	That's right.
2053380	2055500	Anyhow, why is this important?
2055500	2057860	Because the demo that's coming out on the 3DS
2057860	2060420	is going to cost 200 yen.
2060420	2061500	That would be about the equivalent
2061500	2063820	of $2.50 here in America.
2063820	2068820	What we are talking about is a paid demo for the game.
2068980	2070980	Now, granted, that's a cheap demo
2070980	2072380	and one could argue that, well,
2072380	2075100	you're still getting to play at least part of the game,
2075100	2078780	but doesn't something strike you as really, really wrong
2078780	2080700	about the concept of a paid demo,
2080700	2083500	especially from a company that's thrived on
2083500	2085860	great word of mouth from free demos throughout the years?
2085860	2087540	Like, I don't know, Dead Rising.
2087540	2090860	Like a lot of people decided they wanted that game
2090860	2091740	based off the demo.
2091740	2093980	Lost Planet, same type of thing, right?
2093980	2096580	So why now a change in the strategy?
2096580	2099100	Was this maybe a part of the whole,
2099100	2102420	they were gonna charge for the Mega Man Legends 3 prototype,
2102420	2104220	which was essentially a paid demo?
2105260	2106420	Like, what is going on?
2106420	2108460	What do you guys think of paid demos?
2108460	2109540	Is it a rip?
2109540	2110380	Or is it worth it?
2110380	2111860	It depends on how much of the game you're getting.
2111860	2112700	Yeah.
2112700	2116500	Because if it is like a really in-depth demo,
2116500	2118700	then yeah, I can see $2.50 forward.
2118700	2119540	I mean, keep in mind,
2119540	2122500	I used to get the PlayStation,
2122500	2123820	people used to just basically buy
2123820	2126180	the PlayStation Magazine thing for the demo discs.
2126180	2127780	No, that's true, that's true.
2127780	2128620	That's an interesting comparison.
2128620	2130380	And the same was done with the Xbox Magazine,
2130380	2132180	same was done with Dreamcast.
2133140	2136140	Because I have a bunch of demo discs from magazines
2136140	2137860	because I wanted to try out the game
2137860	2138700	that was on the demo disc,
2138700	2140340	and the only way you could get it was on the magazine.
2140340	2141740	You still got a magazine, though.
2141740	2143580	That was the thing, you're buying the magazine.
2143580	2146100	Whether you're buying the magazine for the disc
2146100	2147280	or buying it for whatever,
2147280	2148860	that was paid for by advertisers.
2148860	2151220	And you could say the disc is tangible.
2151220	2154460	I mean, but it's an interesting comparison
2154460	2155300	I haven't heard yet.
2155300	2156660	Well, it's not the first time
2156660	2158180	that they've done this kind of crap.
2158180	2160500	I mean, look at, you know,
2160500	2163820	you might even say like Dead Rising Case Zero
2163820	2166900	or whatever was a paid demo.
2166900	2168960	Because it's an Xbox Live Arcade game.
2168960	2173740	Oh, I'm sorry, it was a prequel to Dead Rising 2.
2173740	2176960	Yeah, whatever, okay, it was basically a demo.
2176960	2180520	So you gave the demo a unique storyline
2180520	2182560	that tied into the actual game.
2182560	2184240	I kind of looked at it as DLC
2184240	2186100	that didn't require the game.
2186100	2188160	That's, and that's why I kind of let it slide.
2188160	2190620	It was something extra that wasn't actually in the game
2190620	2192240	that, you know, had its own achievements,
2192240	2193720	it had its own ranking,
2193720	2195720	it was its own kind of standalone thing.
2195720	2197800	Well, what if, you know,
2197800	2200280	for people who've bought the demo for the game,
2200280	2203120	they get something cool when the actual game comes out?
2204880	2206720	What if that's associated with it?
2206720	2208580	Because we don't have that detail.
2208580	2209420	You know, it's funny,
2209420	2211120	kind of a similar comment we have in chat.
2211120	2212620	Chalice's pop in our chat room says,
2212620	2214440	if it was a pre-order bonus disc
2214440	2216240	that came with a cash deposit,
2216240	2217540	or I could use that money down
2217540	2219440	against the retail version of the game,
2219440	2222520	and I don't buy it my loss, then I'd be okay with it.
2222520	2224680	But to buy a demo and then buy the retail version
2224680	2226200	for full price, I don't know,
2226200	2229520	I just wait for reviews and go straight to the retail.
2229520	2231160	See, I think that they're gonna have to work out
2231160	2233740	some sort of perk with that or it's gonna fail.
2233740	2236200	They have to give people incentive to,
2236200	2239000	especially for such a bizarre looking game.
2239000	2242200	What an interesting way that digital distribution
2242200	2243040	could go though.
2243040	2246680	Imagine if, and I guess to some extent one could argue
2246680	2248560	you kind of have this already with some things,
2248560	2253160	but what if like you could play the first stage of a game
2253160	2256120	by paying two bucks, and then if you like it,
2256120	2258760	you buy the entire game for an extra 38?
2258760	2262420	Isn't that kind of how the Xbox arcade thing?
2262420	2266180	You don't pay for those demos.
2266180	2268020	But since you brought up Xbox.
2268020	2270060	But I mean you could pay a couple of levels
2270060	2272380	and then if you had to do one of the game in your arcade,
2272380	2273680	wasn't that like?
2273680	2274520	Game room?
2274520	2275360	Yeah.
2275360	2276180	Sorta?
2276180	2277020	Yeah.
2277020	2277860	Kinda.
2277860	2278680	Kinda.
2278680	2279520	I don't know, game room was kind of its own thing.
2279520	2280360	I get what you're going with that though.
2280360	2283060	But I think more about Fable 2, I think they did this.
2283060	2286300	I think they chopped up Fable 2 into like six chapters
2286300	2288280	and they put it out as episodes.
2288280	2290280	So they kinda did something like this.
2290280	2292260	But I mean it was a while after the whole thing
2292260	2293100	had already been released.
2293100	2293940	Like they just wanted to sell
2293940	2296340	as many freaking copies of that game any way they could.
2296340	2298900	Slice it, dice it, circumcise it,
2298900	2301540	whatever you gotta do to sell the game
2301540	2303820	bit by bit, little by little.
2303820	2304640	Yeah.
2304640	2305480	So.
2305480	2306320	Milk that franchise.
2306320	2307820	Exactly.
2307820	2309900	Dungeon Buster says Wolf 3D gave you
2309900	2311380	the first few levels for free
2311380	2313300	and then if you wanted the whole game then you paid.
2313300	2315380	You didn't pay up front, same with Doom.
2315380	2318300	One could argue that you might have paid
2318300	2319140	for Wolfenstein 3D.
2319140	2321420	No, I did pay for shareware.
2321420	2322260	You had to buy the shareware disk.
2322260	2324940	Because you used to have to buy the disks.
2324940	2327220	You would go buy the floppies at the store
2327220	2328860	that already had it on there.
2328860	2331460	So that was fine, but here's the thing though
2331460	2333660	about shareware for the most part.
2333660	2337340	Shareware, you could enjoy the game as a whole
2337340	2338620	with just the shareware.
2338620	2341860	Like you would get one campaign of it I guess.
2341860	2343800	But you could get the additional campaigns
2343800	2345020	if you had the full disk.
2345020	2347500	Like Wolfenstein, you play through the whole first campaign
2347500	2350740	but there was four campaigns total with the full version.
2350740	2352540	This is a demo.
2352540	2355500	This is not, you know, part of the game.
2355500	2357220	This is the demo.
2358900	2361680	This is Capcom figuring out ways to be dicks.
2362780	2367460	I mean, whether it's locking saves or weird DRM,
2367460	2369940	it's their way of, you know,
2369940	2373180	how can we make more money and fuck people over?
2373180	2375140	Because that's what we do best, Capcom.
2375140	2378100	Whoa, but this is not the same Capcom from a year ago
2378100	2380220	that started Mega Man Legends in the first place.
2380220	2382940	Is Bobby Kotick running Capcom for some reason?
2382940	2385140	Did he like just all of a sudden,
2385140	2388660	is he like Fred Savage where he wears
2388660	2390380	a bunch of different skin suits?
2390380	2392700	Did Activision buy Capcom and we just didn't hear?
2392700	2394060	Like is that what happened?
2395740	2397580	So, all right.
2399020	2401580	Anyhow, I guess at the end of the day,
2401580	2403860	if you don't like it, don't buy it.
2403860	2404700	That's how they'll get the message.
2404700	2406340	Well, it's a weird Japanese game
2406340	2407820	that will probably never make it over here
2407820	2409700	so that is easy enough.
2409700	2411700	And I'm saying it to the Japanese listeners,
2411700	2413340	all three of you.
2413340	2416340	Let's see, Kitsune, Ikuma JP, and I think there's one other.
2417540	2420220	All three of you, make a stand.
2420220	2424120	Three out of three OLR listeners in Japan reject this game.
2425340	2426460	All right, moving on.
2427620	2429300	Well, how about some news about harmonics?
2429300	2430980	We haven't really heard from them in a while, have we?
2430980	2432000	I heart harmonics.
2432000	2432840	What's new with harmonics?
2432840	2434580	Whatever happened to that, sorry,
2434580	2435660	I know this isn't what you're reporting on,
2435660	2437340	but whatever happened to that freaking game
2437340	2438560	they were supposed to announce at E3
2438560	2440300	that kind of disappeared.
2440300	2444580	What, you mean vid rhythm?
2444580	2445620	Yeah, vid rhythm.
2445620	2447920	They didn't say much about it.
2447920	2452140	No real details yet, but anyway, they're happy.
2452140	2454140	They like not being a part of Viacom
2454140	2457260	or any other calm there is.
2457260	2460140	In fact, Tracy Rosenthal Newsome,
2460140	2462460	who is the VP of production,
2462460	2464940	said it's been a terrific opportunity.
2464940	2467860	And I quote, we are very well supported,
2467860	2469460	but really the most important thing
2469460	2471080	is that there's a huge amount of creative energy
2471080	2474020	that has bubbled up during our independence.
2474020	2476580	They've been in development of Dance Central 2
2476580	2478900	and they're putting small games together,
2478900	2481060	making prototypes and innovating.
2481060	2484420	So they are still working on vid rhythm,
2484420	2486460	which there's not too many details,
2486460	2490300	but it's just been described as fun.
2490300	2491420	They're not giving a timeline,
2491420	2493740	but we'll be hearing about it soon is what she said.
2493740	2498740	Well, vid rhythm is made up of vid and rhythm and fun.
2500940	2504100	But right now the focus is on Rock Band DLC.
2506060	2507100	And it's saying that Rock Band 3
2507100	2508800	still has tons of life left in it.
2510820	2514300	So we can be expecting, of course,
2514300	2517500	Dance Central 2 on connect in fall.
2519140	2522540	Any thoughts on possible Rock Band 4 next year?
2522540	2524300	Or do you think, no, it's still too soon to bring?
2524300	2525140	Thinks too soon.
2525140	2526060	You think, really?
2526060	2526900	Yeah.
2529020	2530220	I really do think it is too soon.
2530220	2531940	I was randomly thinking about that the other day
2531940	2534100	as like, well, obviously all those games
2534100	2536420	took this year off, except for Dance Central,
2536420	2538420	but the plastic instrument games
2538420	2540340	will say are taking the year off.
2540340	2545240	And they're saying that Guitar Hero is not dead.
2545240	2546980	I think they've said Rock Band's not dead,
2546980	2548980	but they're all taking a break.
2548980	2551540	But I wonder if it's a break until next year,
2551540	2553260	or maybe it's gonna be a break long enough
2553260	2556700	for the next wave of consoles as well.
2556700	2557620	That's a good thought.
2557620	2560820	I mean, I think right now is just they're really
2560820	2563300	trying to avoid that oversaturation.
2563300	2565700	They've got a good product now.
2565700	2567120	They're still selling something
2567120	2569820	without having to develop anything new right now.
2569820	2571140	So as long as it's selling
2571140	2573620	and as long as people keep buying the download packs,
2573620	2576620	then there's no reason for them to make a new one yet.
2576620	2578180	Well, and Dance Central 2
2578180	2580540	is probably gonna sell really well.
2580540	2583020	It'll probably stay a huge connect seller
2583020	2583860	through the holidays.
2583860	2587140	So I think everybody knows it, you know.
2587140	2588340	First one was a quality connect.
2588340	2589860	I like dance masters.
2590700	2591540	Ew.
2593500	2595380	All right, let's travel around the world
2595380	2596460	and look at some release dates
2596460	2598060	and see what you can get a whole lot sooner
2598060	2600140	than the holidays as in next week.
2600140	2602160	What's coming out next week in America?
2605260	2606100	Not much of anything.
2606100	2607660	Hasn't that been like this,
2607660	2609900	the reaction for like the past four weeks?
2609900	2610740	Well, no.
2610740	2611580	Nothing has freaking come out of here.
2611580	2614980	There was actually stuff last week
2614980	2616480	or this week, I should say.
2617660	2620260	No, the next week, there really is hardly anything.
2620260	2622180	I mean, here's what we got
2622180	2623380	and I'll run it down real quick.
2623380	2624700	Wait, can I say this real quick though?
2624700	2625720	It did make the show real tonight,
2625720	2626780	but there was a big press release
2626780	2630360	about how Catherine is Atlas's biggest launch seller ever.
2630360	2632540	It's already sold like 200,000 copies.
2632540	2634300	I gotta admit, there is this cynical part of me
2634300	2635540	that's kind of like, you sold that much
2635540	2637560	because there's nothing else to buy right now.
2637560	2640480	There is nothing else.
2640480	2642500	It also helps that you put a woman
2642500	2644040	with large breasts on your...
2644040	2644880	Yeah, that helps too.
2644880	2645720	That does help too, yeah.
2645720	2648560	And all the trailers have been, you know,
2648560	2650100	her sleeping with a dude.
2650100	2653320	It just shows, America wants porno games.
2654620	2655860	Think about it.
2655860	2657080	Yeah, they do.
2659300	2660840	All right, here's what we got coming out next week.
2660840	2662020	All DS titles.
2662020	2664340	Touch and Play Collection on the Nintendo DS.
2664340	2665420	It's a bunch of casual games.
2665420	2667060	Hurrah.
2667060	2668740	Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
2668740	2670900	It's an adventure game on the DS.
2670900	2673340	And Puzzler World 2.
2673340	2675780	Once again, another collection of casual puzzle games.
2675780	2676660	That is it.
2676660	2677500	Done.
2677500	2679820	Nothing else to report on.
2679820	2681700	Is it because kids are getting ready to go back to school?
2681700	2683260	No, it's just a dead week.
2683260	2684100	I don't know.
2684100	2686420	A week after there's some stuff.
2687780	2690820	It's just, you know, I don't know.
2690820	2691660	All right.
2691660	2692800	Well, let's travel to Japan
2692800	2694300	and look at the Japanese release dates.
2694300	2696860	Let's see if it's a similar story over there.
2696860	2697740	Well, I'll tell you this.
2697740	2700320	On the Xbox 360 this week, nothing.
2700320	2703020	Nothing coming out on the 360 this week.
2703020	2704820	Going over to the PlayStation 3.
2704820	2708660	WWE All-Stars is released this week from THQ.
2708660	2710000	So, I guess you have that.
2710940	2714140	Going to the Nintendo systems,
2714140	2716440	seeing if there's anything coming out there.
2718540	2721100	Actually, I have the PSP up first on my list.
2721100	2725620	There's Monhuniki, Poka Poka, Ailou Muraji,
2725620	2729720	and then Uta No, Prince Sama Repeat.
2729720	2731420	Yes, those are the two games coming out.
2731420	2733460	Uta means song or theme.
2733460	2735580	That first one, the Monhuniki,
2735580	2739740	is a farm, fish, and hunt monsters RPG on the PSP.
2739740	2741940	And then the second one there is,
2741940	2745780	it looks like it's from Broccoli.
2745780	2748000	Oh, oh, oh, let me look at it.
2748000	2749560	I thought Broccoli went into business.
2749560	2750780	Nope, they're still there.
2750780	2753180	And it looks like it might be like a...
2753180	2755520	It's a dating sim for girls.
2755520	2756360	Kinda.
2756360	2757280	It's a pretty boy.
2757280	2759000	Yeah, pretty boy dating sim.
2759000	2761920	Theme of the Prince Repeat.
2763320	2764580	Oh, it could be like a redo.
2764580	2765880	If it's called Repeat,
2765880	2768420	it could be like a re-release or something like that.
2768420	2769600	Or a special edition.
2769600	2771120	Whatever, I don't think anyone here
2771120	2772480	is gonna be importing that.
2773400	2776120	Kitsune, Ikuma, JP, any interest in that game?
2777120	2778320	I'm thinking no.
2778320	2779640	And that's it.
2779640	2780720	You go to the Wii, there's nothing.
2780720	2783320	3DS, Super Pokemon Scramble.
2783320	2784640	I guess that's kind of a big deal.
2784640	2786160	It is a Pokemon game coming out.
2786160	2789240	It's not an official Pokemon black or white
2789240	2790320	type of Pokemon game,
2790320	2792780	but it is a Pokemon related universe game.
2792780	2794720	That's probably the biggest release this week.
2794720	2796960	Unless you wanna get a new pouch for your 3DS
2796960	2799000	with Street Fighter characters on it.
2799000	2800440	There you go.
2800440	2803800	Your very busy release day schedule in Japan.
2803800	2804880	How about your...
2804880	2806300	There's a few things.
2806300	2809080	Actually, today, I guess already,
2809080	2812320	Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 came out.
2812320	2814680	On the 10th, we have Fruit Ninja Connect,
2814680	2818120	and Hysteria Project 2 for PSP and PlayStation 3.
2818120	2820640	And on the 11th, we have Edge, and that's it.
2822040	2823560	Meh.
2823560	2825160	Thank God we do have some people in Japan
2825160	2826520	who actually listen to this show.
2826520	2829000	Kitsune actually is jumping in saying,
2829000	2832880	Utuno Prince Sama is actually an anime in Japan.
2832880	2834520	So it is an actual anime.
2834520	2836320	Let's see, I'm actually trying to...
2836320	2841320	Oh, opening theme.
2848320	2849160	Looks very...
2849160	2850080	Yeah, I wanna play that.
2850080	2850920	Shoujo.
2851800	2852640	I'll watch it.
2852640	2853720	Ah.
2853720	2856200	Just watching that trailer gave me a period.
2856200	2857040	All right.
2858560	2859920	No ice cream for you.
2861160	2862280	Moving on.
2862280	2863940	More gaming news, Loki.
2863940	2868020	Ah, that's a very wonderful image.
2870300	2871140	So...
2871140	2872580	I got a uterus, let's make a baby.
2876180	2877260	Chirp, chirp.
2877260	2882260	Yes, the studio behind Minecraft, Mojang,
2883620	2886940	they have been threatened with lawsuit
2886940	2891740	over their new game called Scrolls.
2891740	2895280	Apparently, Scrolls is a card game.
2897000	2900340	Like a card RPG strategy game or whatever.
2900340	2904820	And it kinda looks a little medieval-ish.
2904820	2906220	And so Bethesda's saying,
2906220	2908660	hey, that infringes on our own trademark,
2908660	2910100	the Elder Scrolls.
2914740	2916860	I don't know if I'd buy that.
2916860	2919700	Because they have the monopoly on Scrolls.
2919700	2920660	Exactly.
2920660	2921900	That's what it is.
2921900	2924140	This reminds me of, God, what was that?
2924140	2926980	It was the Mirror's Edge stuff.
2926980	2928220	And I think it was Edge,
2928220	2930620	or something about using Edge in a game
2930620	2933060	was inappropriate or whatever.
2933060	2934180	The guys tried to sue.
2934180	2936340	Oh, well, it's just like, was it Monster?
2937420	2940560	Monster Cables, they sue everybody
2940560	2943300	that uses the word monster and stuff.
2943300	2948100	Even if it has nothing to do with cables,
2948100	2952420	electronics, anything, yes.
2952420	2954900	These people are what we call assholes.
2956120	2958260	Or their lawyers are assholes.
2958260	2961420	I'm sorry, when it's a generic,
2961420	2962780	it would be different if it was like
2962780	2965400	the Elder Cards or something like that.
2965400	2967660	Okay, you got something there, maybe.
2967660	2970920	But if a word scrolls,
2970920	2974820	which no one owns a trademark to the word scrolls,
2974820	2976500	you have the Elder Scrolls.
2976500	2981500	If it was like the Elder Card Scrolls battle game.
2981540	2984540	The Elder Parchments, Armageddon.
2985980	2987780	You know, if it was something like that,
2987780	2989860	then yeah, you might have a case.
2989860	2992420	But it's just too damn generic.
2992420	2994120	And honestly, I don't think they're gonna win,
2994120	2997120	even if they did end up going through with a lawsuit.
2997120	2999640	They're just playing the tactic right now
2999640	3002000	where it's like, oh, we're big bad Bethesda.
3003580	3005900	You know, we're gonna file a lawsuit against you,
3005900	3009100	so you little indie developer better do what we want.
3009100	3011380	Why do big companies have to be bullies like that?
3011380	3014860	It's kind of a double-edged sword everywhere.
3014860	3017140	It's basically, they have to protect
3017140	3019860	their intellectual properties,
3019860	3021580	but at the same time, they kind of overstep
3021580	3024100	their boundaries and try to go after people
3024100	3025780	that really aren't trying to infringe
3025780	3027300	on their intellectual properties,
3027300	3029500	and that's what's going on here.
3029500	3032420	It's because the people that make the games
3032420	3034840	aren't necessarily the suits and the lawyers
3034840	3036460	that are actually going after these people.
3036460	3039640	It's separate entities altogether.
3043020	3043860	All right.
3045420	3048460	Clearly, this will get settled out of court,
3048460	3049760	which means they're probably gonna end up
3049760	3051900	being forced to change the name, and then that's it,
3051900	3053180	which is ridiculous.
3053180	3055340	I hope they kind of stick to their guns and don't do it.
3055340	3056920	Call it mind scrolls.
3056920	3057760	There you go.
3059260	3060140	All right, let's move on,
3060140	3063000	talk about some Kinect news related on the Xbox.
3063000	3065060	Apparently, a rating has been spotted
3065060	3068020	for Kinect Fun Labs Air Band.
3068020	3071620	I guess that is the next Fun Lab that's gonna come out.
3071620	3074600	Did you guys know that that whole Be in a Talk Show thing
3074600	3075600	came out for Fun Labs?
3075600	3076440	I have yet to play it.
3076440	3077280	Fun Labs, what?
3077280	3078520	And I guess Sparkler's out too.
3078520	3079360	Huh?
3079360	3082020	I thought that was Avatar Kinect,
3082020	3083780	not, you know, that was something separate.
3083780	3085300	That's what it's called, Avatar Kinect.
3085300	3087060	Yeah, that came out, and then the Sparkler thing
3087060	3088420	that they were showing at E3 came out.
3088420	3089260	I haven't played either one.
3089260	3091140	Yeah, I don't care about either one of those.
3091140	3092880	Dark Soccer, at some point, you should take your Kinect
3092880	3093780	out of the box.
3093780	3094620	It'll work a lot better.
3094620	3097000	As soon as someone lends me as dance masters.
3097000	3097840	No.
3097840	3099300	You said you were gonna lend it to me.
3099300	3101100	You have Kinect adventures to play.
3101100	3101940	Go rafting.
3101940	3104020	No, don't go rafting.
3105020	3106760	You can do Avatar Kinect.
3106760	3110200	You can host your own Oprah show as your avatar.
3112940	3116160	You can do Kinect, okay, okay, Kinect Sparkler.
3116160	3118380	It's kind of like having fire in your hands.
3119260	3120100	You don't like fire?
3120100	3121580	I don't want to para para.
3121580	3123980	It's kind of like if fire was lame.
3127180	3130260	And really, you know, how can you make fire lame?
3130260	3131740	You can't, but yet,
3132860	3136400	Kinect's Fun Labs manages to make fire lame.
3136400	3137260	All right, so I guess,
3137260	3139020	Kinect Fun Labs Air Band's probably coming.
3139020	3141460	I want to say, when they did the whole voting
3141460	3143540	on the different, like, labs to come out,
3143540	3146380	wasn't one of them like a keyboard that you could play,
3146380	3148300	like, in that scene from Big,
3148300	3150780	but you didn't actually need a keyboard on the ground?
3150780	3152100	Like, that was one of the whole,
3152100	3153260	that's what this sounds like.
3153260	3154600	Oh, I really hope it is.
3154600	3155440	I really hope it is,
3155440	3158140	because I could relive that scene from Big
3158140	3159160	over and over again,
3159160	3162300	and I will be the life of my own party.
3162300	3163140	Hold on, though.
3163140	3164660	In about another year,
3164660	3166620	wouldn't something like that entertain Josh
3166620	3168140	for, like, 15 minutes at least?
3168140	3168980	No.
3168980	3169820	No?
3171500	3172780	It's not even a babysitter?
3172780	3173620	No.
3173620	3174500	No?
3174500	3175340	No.
3176220	3178220	Connect-O-Moles would entertain him,
3178220	3181820	but, you know, Kinect Fun Labs, no.
3181820	3183420	It's just like, hey, look, haha,
3183420	3184540	look at all these indie guys
3184540	3185940	who are doing all these hacks and stuff.
3185940	3188060	We want a piece of that action, you know?
3188060	3189740	Come to Kinect, because it's fun.
3189740	3191760	It's whimsical.
3193360	3197020	No, all this shit's gonna be is fucking Wii music, okay?
3197020	3200580	That's all this bullshit Wii music.
3200580	3203460	God, even saying the word Wii music
3203460	3207300	just flashes me back to the E3 press conference
3207300	3211380	where Miyamoto comes out playing a fucking fake,
3211380	3214060	you know, saxophone thing, and how lame that was.
3214060	3216560	It's just like, ah, it burns!
3217560	3218900	It's so terrible.
3218900	3219860	It's like you're suffering from
3219860	3221980	post-traumatic stress disorder or something.
3221980	3225920	I'm suing Nintendo, PTSD from their damn conference.
3227780	3228620	All right, well, I don't know
3228620	3230340	if you'll wanna sue Microsoft over this,
3230340	3233540	but they are trying to put out more Kinect games.
3233540	3236020	They are actually saying one Kinect-enabled
3236020	3238540	Xbox Live Arcade game a month.
3238540	3240660	That's something they're trying to do there.
3241540	3245860	That is according to product marketing manager Robin Burrow.
3245860	3248740	Quote, we're targeting a frequency of about one a month
3248740	3250300	for Xbox Live Arcade portfolio
3250300	3251920	that will have Kinect integration.
3251920	3254860	That will be really powerful and differentiate the platform.
3254860	3257700	Of course, coming out very soon, Fruit Ninja Kinect.
3257700	3259340	We'll kick things off.
3259340	3262920	Fruit Ninja Kinect, eh, that's stupid, silly fun.
3262920	3264980	But some of the other stuff that they had,
3264980	3267500	you know, like the new Burnout game,
3267500	3269620	just makes me wanna cry.
3269620	3274220	It's just, it's Burnout, a great franchise,
3274220	3277100	great racing game, and we have this top-down thing
3277100	3279700	where I gotta hop up and down to make my car explode.
3281260	3282620	Lame.
3282620	3286020	This isn't Micro Machines, this is fucking Burnout.
3286020	3287540	If I wanna play Micro Machines,
3287540	3291640	the top-down racing game from like the 90s,
3291640	3294940	I'd play Micro Machines, maybe 80s.
3294940	3296180	Might be before the 90s.
3297380	3298540	Freaking John Machida.
3300220	3301740	That's what I'm talking about.
3303060	3305480	All right, let's move on, I guess,
3305480	3306900	to the classic game of the week.
3306900	3309900	We're just running through the news tonight.
3309900	3311260	It's kind of a slow news week.
3311260	3312560	It's hard to fill a three-hour show
3312560	3314900	when there's not too much going on outside of
3315860	3317500	kids going back to school and so forth,
3317500	3320260	especially, look at what's coming out
3320260	3321880	this week in games, nothing.
3321880	3325380	So why not go back and revisit a classic?
3325380	3326380	Every week here on the show,
3326380	3328420	Dark Sakura takes a step into the vault,
3328420	3330060	finds a classic video game that she thinks,
3330060	3335060	hey, you ungrateful brats, study this.
3335060	3336180	It's a classic video game of the week.
3336180	3337580	Dark Sakura, what game did you pick
3337580	3338420	for your classic video games?
3338420	3339860	I picked a really fucked up game,
3339860	3341340	game series, I should say.
3341340	3342420	Black Matrix.
3343300	3345300	It's actually Black Slash Matrix.
3345300	3346540	Is that like Keanu Reeves?
3346540	3348780	Whoa, I know what a fool.
3348780	3352300	It's actually a tactical RPG series.
3353180	3355420	And it's sort of like,
3356260	3358020	it kind of does like a mimicking
3358020	3359860	of Christian religious themes,
3359860	3361700	but it's kind of different.
3361700	3363360	It has heaven, hell, earth,
3363360	3365140	and all the people that live there.
3365140	3367980	And the first one came out in 1998
3367980	3369740	for the Sega Saturn.
3369740	3373040	And it was just so weird.
3373040	3375820	Okay, first of all, you play as
3375820	3380220	a different character who belongs
3380220	3382460	to a dominatrix of some sort.
3382460	3384760	And then you fight, sort of like,
3386540	3387940	you've got your move, your attack,
3387940	3390620	your item, that's all a turn-based
3390620	3392580	strategy game type of game.
3392580	3394700	I didn't really quite get into it,
3394700	3396300	but it had a very interesting story,
3396300	3397580	I should put it that way.
3397580	3400500	You also had counters, you could defend,
3400500	3402180	you could dodge attacks.
3402180	3404260	You also had a waiting attack.
3404260	3406380	You also had magic commands.
3406380	3410340	You also had different spell effectiveness
3410340	3411780	that changed from turn to turn
3411780	3414620	that was controlled by biorhythms.
3414620	3417260	You had, instead of magic points,
3417260	3419300	you had blood points, and you can distribute
3419300	3421860	your blood points to all the usable characters
3421860	3423740	to use for their spell casting.
3423740	3427580	And you get more by attacking defeated enemies.
3427580	3431800	So you basically kill them and steal their blood.
3431800	3434520	And then you can actually put blood points
3434520	3438840	into weapons to unleash a special attack,
3438840	3440920	called its latent ability,
3440920	3443760	or you could make it more effective.
3443760	3445600	You could add different types of damage
3445600	3448480	that the weapon would deal.
3448480	3451520	And then after each battle, you get a letter grade rank,
3451520	3452760	depending on how well you did.
3452760	3455680	And so you get bonus items, money, and experience,
3455680	3457960	depending on how well you did in battle,
3457960	3460000	which I thought was a really cool system.
3460000	3462640	So basically, the main character of the first one
3462640	3465800	is named Abel, who is an amnesiac,
3465800	3470240	and he is the main protagonist of Black Matrix.
3471280	3475920	He's basically an angel, and he's locked up in the prison
3475920	3477260	for the crime of love.
3478360	3482560	And he can change Black Wings into White Wings
3482560	3483800	and all kinds of different stuff.
3483800	3486320	And then you get your different masters,
3486320	3487640	your dominatrixes.
3487640	3490600	You know, you have Domina, Purica,
3490600	3493720	Michette, Purecious, and Prague.
3494760	3497840	So, who I always used to just call plague.
3497840	3501120	But you also could get a male master named Zero
3501120	3503060	who was available after a code.
3503060	3504680	So you have all kinds of different ones.
3504680	3507420	Then Black Matrix 2 came out.
3508420	3509640	Actually, let me go back.
3509640	3513560	I should actually talk about Black Matrix AD Advanced,
3513560	3517560	and then Black Matrix Cross are in the same series.
3517560	3519960	They're the same game, pretty much.
3519960	3522560	They just add different elements to the game.
3522560	3524440	So I forgot to mention those.
3524440	3526840	And then we got, okay, Black Matrix 2 came out
3526840	3530240	for the PlayStation 2 on March 28th, 2002,
3530240	3532680	and it's set in the hell realm.
3532680	3535240	And it's, again, more of the same stuff.
3535240	3538440	You have, instead, though, you have your main character
3538440	3540400	who was like the strongest devil in hell,
3540400	3541320	and then he got amnesia.
3541320	3542760	Oops.
3542760	3545160	And so, you know, it has,
3545160	3547420	the story actually revolves around that.
3547420	3548880	Then there was Black Matrix Zero,
3548880	3552240	which is actually listed as Zero Zero.
3552240	3555020	They came out on May 13th, 2004 on the PlayStation.
3555020	3558360	And again, like all the other ones,
3558360	3560200	it was only out in Japan.
3560200	3563560	And it's a prequel to the other Black Matrix games.
3565540	3567560	And that's pretty much it.
3567560	3570100	You really cannot get them in English
3570100	3573640	unless someone has managed to do some kind of patch.
3573640	3578600	And they're really fucked up games.
3578600	3581160	Also, they have great music.
3581160	3583760	I do have to say that, like, that one right there.
3584880	3587120	That's the, that's Zero Zero, isn't it?
3589480	3590880	Yeah, this is First Battle.
3591840	3593000	It's got great music.
3593000	3594680	It's one thing I did like about these games
3594680	3596720	is it had fantastic music.
3596720	3599280	But it's just the themes are really, really dark.
3600760	3602760	Brightman in chat wants to know who made this game.
3602760	3603740	Cheech or Chong?
3606160	3607120	That wasn't funny.
3608040	3610600	It actually came out by Flight Plan.
3610600	3612720	And it was published by Inter Channel
3612720	3616080	in case anyone actually was curious for a real reason.
3617240	3620640	One of the titles actually did get considered
3620640	3623840	for a North American release.
3623840	3628240	However, because of the religious themes in it,
3628240	3632280	I would actually have to say pretty sacrilegious things
3632280	3635160	in it, it got the boot.
3636120	3637280	I think we were supposed to get-
3637280	3639520	Could they have just changed the art or something?
3639520	3641240	And I don't know.
3641240	3643760	Isn't there other ways they can kind of get around it?
3643760	3645000	They can release anime with that.
3645000	3646760	They should be able to release a video game with that.
3646760	3649880	The Flight Matrix just had a pretty interesting story.
3649880	3652640	And yeah, but the first one was really, in my opinion,
3652640	3654240	the best, because you have to work
3654240	3656080	for your dominatrix mistress.
3656080	3657960	And you choose your mistress, by the way,
3657960	3659400	at the beginning of the game.
3660520	3661440	Sexy.
3661440	3663600	Yeah, so that's it.
3663600	3665960	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.
3665960	3669480	Black Matrix, that's black slash matrix.
3669480	3672440	And good luck finding that one to play.
3672440	3674040	I have a friend who's got the Saturn version.
3674040	3676480	But think about it, you'll learn Japanese while you play,
3676480	3678240	because it's not in English at all.
3678240	3679460	So good luck with that.
3679460	3682440	All right, but a good trip down memory lane nonetheless,
3682440	3684720	on a one that I'm sure most people listening
3684720	3687040	probably have never heard of, so there you go.
3687040	3688040	All right, anyhow, that's gonna do it
3688040	3689240	for the first half of our show tonight.
3689240	3691520	Don't go anywhere, guys, we still have plenty to go here
3691520	3693000	tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.
3693000	3694480	Some rapid fire news when we get back.
3694480	3695600	We gotta talk about what happened
3695600	3697400	on Blizzard's call this week.
3697400	3699320	Some really interesting updates on Diablo 3,
3699320	3700880	as well as World of Warcraft.
3700880	3703780	Another lawsuit involving Band Hero.
3703780	3707280	And you're never gonna believe this story about Skyrim.
3707280	3709440	It actually has nothing to do with the game.
3709440	3710280	Just wait for it.
3710280	3711720	We'll talk about all that when we come back
3711720	3715160	with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
3715160	3719320	["Orange Lounge Radio Theme Song"]
3720920	3723920	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
3723920	3726320	We are live on this Sunday evening,
3726320	3731040	August the 7th, if I lose my calendar right, of 2011,
3731040	3735320	where we're taping the 423rd episode of our show.
3735320	3737080	I'm starting to lose count, oh my gosh.
3737080	3738280	Anyhow, we're gonna get back
3738280	3740560	into some rapid fire news tonight,
3740560	3742280	and do some quick stories for you guys.
3742280	3743880	Luke, you start us off.
3743880	3746940	All right, so let's see, starting things off,
3746940	3748920	let's talk a little bit about Borderlands 2,
3748920	3751440	which I'm very excited that got announced.
3751440	3754900	That'll be coming out sometime after March 2012.
3754900	3759900	It's gonna be the next fiscal year for Take Two.
3759900	3763600	And it's pretty awesome.
3763600	3767240	They had a little bit of a tease in the new Game Informer.
3767240	3769600	Some of the details, I've kind of bleeped out about it
3769600	3772000	so far, one of the new playable characters
3772000	3774960	is gonna be Salvador the Dwarf, he is what they call
3774960	3778000	a Gunzerker, basically a guy that's able
3778000	3780780	to dual wield weapons, which is pretty cool.
3780780	3783440	And of course they're saying that there's gonna be
3783440	3788440	better AI, as well as the old NPC character,
3789760	3791280	or the old characters from the first game
3791280	3793520	are gonna be NPC characters in this new game.
3795600	3798600	Yeah, it looks awesome, I can't wait to check it out.
3798600	3803400	The first game was just amazing.
3803400	3807460	Of course, DC Universe Online is doing pretty well.
3807460	3810800	Right now they're going to be merging some servers
3810800	3814700	into mega servers, and this is gonna be happening on Monday.
3815660	3817540	That doesn't strike me as news you hear
3817540	3819180	when a game's doing well.
3819180	3821480	Well, whatever, well is the subjective term.
3821480	3822420	I guess so.
3822420	3827420	Apparently they're previously held as super servers.
3828640	3830900	Mega servers will give the player's ability
3830900	3835640	to switch between PVP and PVE styles of gameplay.
3835640	3840640	And, I don't know, I guess before it was maybe.
3842180	3844180	Oh hey, apparently we're playing Listis tonight,
3844180	3845980	except we're not, sorry about that.
3845980	3848580	I think maybe before they were, you had to switch
3848580	3850780	actual servers, you had to have a player on each server
3850780	3852980	in order to do that, I'm not sure.
3852980	3856500	But right now the servers are set to be merged
3856500	3860040	into four mega servers, one PC, one PS3 server
3860040	3865040	for the US with twin servers in the European regions.
3865220	3867780	So wow, that's interesting.
3867780	3870380	So I guess if you're playing in the US,
3870380	3872420	you'll be playing with everybody in the US.
3873760	3875460	All five other people that are playing
3875460	3877100	DC Universe right now.
3877100	3877940	Yeah.
3877940	3879980	I'm just mad, DC Universe players
3879980	3881420	are gonna write angry emails to the show.
3881420	3883700	I'm not, I'm only being half serious.
3883700	3887060	I mean, I don't know many people at all
3887060	3889100	that are playing it, but obviously some people are.
3889100	3890580	I don't know anyone that plays EverQuest either,
3890580	3891980	but that game's still going.
3893420	3896180	Although, the way things are right now though
3896180	3898740	with all the server merges, some players
3898740	3901720	will be forced to change their names after the merge,
3901720	3903500	since two characters cannot exist
3903500	3905400	with the same name on the same server.
3905400	3910400	So now you'll have to be xxxseparath69xxx, yeah.
3915120	3919600	And then finally, the first jailbreak,
3919600	3922700	or PS3 jailbreak raid in South Africa
3922700	3924220	has one man arrested.
3925660	3928460	Didn't even know they were still going after people there.
3929680	3932940	So apparently they raided this guy in Park Town
3932940	3937280	and confiscated $14,000 worth of computers,
3937280	3941160	PS3s, hard drives, jailbreak software, USB kits,
3941160	3945160	and fake PS2 games and original PS3 games.
3946000	3948560	And they said one man was taken into custody
3948560	3952700	at the Special Commercial Crimes Court, but made bail.
3954980	3957720	What exactly is the crime that these folks are committing?
3957720	3959160	Jailbreaking the PS3?
3959160	3961380	Yeah, jailbreaking the PS3.
3961380	3964640	Which really shouldn't be a crime in the first place.
3964640	3966360	I guess it's a different country,
3966360	3969040	but I thought when it came at least to this country,
3969040	3970380	they found in a court of law
3970380	3971880	that you can jailbreak your phone.
3971880	3972720	Your iPhone.
3972720	3974540	Well your phone, yeah, because that's added
3974540	3977800	to a list of devices that it's okay and legal
3977800	3980400	to do that with, however the PlayStation 3
3980400	3982240	is not one of those devices.
3982240	3985880	Now they were hoping the whole GeoHats thing
3985880	3988480	that it would actually go to trial
3988480	3990800	and he would be found innocent,
3990800	3992280	which case would set a precedent
3992280	3994880	that it's okay to jailbreak that stuff.
3994880	3998900	Of course, him being a pussy also backed out of everything
3998900	4001020	and they settled out of court
4001020	4003320	so he can get his job at Sony or whatever.
4004960	4007100	And so there's no precedent set there.
4009240	4011040	I don't think he works at Sony actually.
4011040	4012320	Yeah, he works at Facebook,
4012320	4013960	but who cares, he's still pussy.
4015800	4017360	But you're not mad, not at all.
4017360	4018360	Oh, I don't care.
4018360	4020320	All right, there's no reason for me
4020320	4022280	to jailbreak my PS3.
4022280	4023640	Don't play enough games on it.
4023640	4025080	All right, let me do some quick stories here.
4025080	4026960	One of them has to do with that 3D TV.
4026960	4029520	Remember this announcement at E3 from Sony?
4029520	4030400	Turned a lot of heads.
4030400	4032840	They were gonna be selling a 3D TV
4032840	4036000	that came with the TV, obviously it was like a monitor,
4036000	4040060	glasses, an HDMI cable, and a copy of Resistance 3
4040060	4042680	and it was all gonna be $499, right?
4042680	4044480	Well, it's not really gonna come
4044480	4046760	with Resistance 3 anymore.
4046760	4048240	That's changed a little bit.
4048240	4050040	So they've decided now it's going to be
4050040	4053640	MotorStorm Apocalypse instead of Resistance 3.
4053640	4057480	Perhaps they want folks to buy the game separately.
4057480	4059080	Maybe they don't wanna be giving it away.
4059080	4061200	Perhaps that MotorStorm Apocalypse didn't sell
4061200	4062880	as well as they had planned and they are sitting
4062880	4065120	on a ton of them and they need to get rid of them.
4065120	4068000	You also get a free copy of E.T. for the Atari 2600.
4068000	4069060	Go figure.
4069060	4070480	They're just throwing that in there for free.
4070480	4072160	I don't know how Sony got ahold of them.
4072160	4073000	I guess they moved their corporate offices to New Mexico.
4073000	4074400	No, don't get me wrong.
4074400	4077400	In MotorStorm Apocalypse, it's sad that it didn't sell
4077400	4079280	as well as they had hoped.
4079280	4080240	It's a great game.
4080240	4084000	It's just, you know, I think people were hoping
4084000	4085240	to get Resistance 3.
4085240	4088080	Although, I'm not sure if it made our show roll,
4088080	4091040	but if you pre-order through GameStop,
4091040	4094520	you still do get Resistance 3 and MotorStorm Apocalypse.
4095560	4097560	But that would require pre-ordering through GameStop.
4097560	4098400	Yes. And I hate them so much.
4098400	4101180	Why would you pre-order a TV through GameStop?
4101180	4102020	Don't do that.
4102020	4103840	Do not be tempted by this.
4103840	4105040	Amazon will match it.
4105040	4106800	Somebody will match it.
4106800	4107640	Just wait.
4108520	4110880	Anyhow, let's see.
4110880	4113960	Apparently, there was a statement made to GameSpot
4113960	4116720	that, not GameStop, but GameSpot.
4118240	4121000	I want to start a website called GamePots,
4121000	4124720	because apparently there's this every way,
4124720	4126720	which way you can rearrange that word.
4126720	4129120	MotorStorm Apocalypse, it will have the full screen,
4129120	4131240	but split screen functionality.
4131240	4133280	Remember that whole, you know, 3D,
4133280	4135080	but one person will see one screen
4135080	4136320	and one will see the other. Yeah, I played that.
4136320	4138320	That's going to be in MotorStorm Apocalypse.
4138320	4142080	Yeah, I played with MLB 11, the show,
4142080	4143960	which I really didn't want to play MLB.
4143960	4146080	See, they had a demonstration during our little
4146080	4147040	Game of Summit thing.
4147040	4149400	I wanted to play MotorStorm.
4149400	4154180	But no, the two guys working the booth decided,
4154180	4156220	hey, we're a fan of baseball.
4156220	4158280	We're going to play baseball.
4158280	4160760	You know, it's about us, not the consumer.
4160760	4163880	So I played that, and it works.
4163880	4167120	Yeah, I don't know.
4167120	4168600	All right, well, some other stories here,
4168600	4171760	one of them about Lollipop Chainsaw.
4171760	4174280	I love it based on the name alone.
4174280	4176600	It's a cheerleader versus zombie game.
4176600	4177840	It's by Grasshopper.
4177840	4179520	They didn't know more heroes, right?
4179520	4181680	That tells you all you need to know right there.
4181680	4183960	Lollipop Chainsaw, it's going to be released
4183960	4185560	outside of Japan in 2012.
4185560	4187340	Warner Brothers Interactive is going to be
4187340	4188180	the ones publishing it.
4188180	4189840	That was announced this week.
4189840	4193320	There's also a partnership now with Kadokawa Games
4193320	4195700	that Warner Brothers will have moving forwards.
4195700	4198280	So more cheerleaders fighting more zombies.
4198280	4200280	Hooray.
4200280	4202640	Hopefully they'll put money into the marketing
4202640	4204600	and the game will sell.
4204600	4207800	Also, one other interesting acquisition this week,
4207800	4211960	Square Enix has got the rights to True Crime Hong Kong.
4211960	4213960	They got the rights from Activision.
4213960	4216600	You might remember that Activision canceled this game
4216600	4218560	some time ago, True Crime Hong Kong.
4218560	4221560	And Square Enix, they said, quote,
4221560	4223520	when we first saw and got our hands on the game,
4223520	4225080	we fell in love with it.
4225080	4227680	That quote from Square Enix London Studios
4227680	4229600	general manager, Lee Singleton.
4229600	4231880	It's a great big bucket of fun.
4231880	4233960	I think it's a good idea that they picked it up.
4233960	4236000	I don't know why Activision got rid of it.
4237640	4239760	But whatever.
4239760	4242640	Now you might be wondering, Square Enix and True Crime?
4242640	4243480	What the heck?
4243480	4245000	Does that mean Cloud is coming to the game?
4245000	4245840	No, no, no, no, no.
4245840	4248520	Don't forget Square Enix now includes Eidos
4248520	4251300	and this would not be out of the realm of possibility
4251300	4254600	for that group that brought what, Deus Ex
4254600	4255680	and some of those other games
4255680	4258200	that now fall under the Square Enix banner.
4258200	4259240	There you go.
4259240	4260540	Dark Sakura.
4260540	4261860	We have some other stuff.
4262940	4267940	Just Dance 3 is getting a Just Create mode
4268040	4271400	that lets players record their own choreography
4271400	4274480	and challenge online and offline players to fit it.
4274480	4277160	But it's just practice right now.
4278120	4279480	There's a trailer out for it.
4279480	4282000	I'm ambivalent, of course.
4283600	4286100	And then we have very sad news.
4286100	4290440	This makes me sniffle because the CEO
4290440	4295440	and founder of Game Arts, Takeshi Miyagi,
4297280	4299560	actually died on July 29th.
4299560	4302920	And I've reviewed a number of games
4302920	4304880	that have come out of Game Arts,
4304880	4309880	including Grandia, Silfied, Lunar, and very sad.
4310600	4313280	He will be succeeded by Ryu Okuriyama,
4313280	4315680	who is a CEO of Gaia Holdings.
4316900	4320220	And last little bit for rapid fire
4320220	4322480	is there are pre-order skins available
4322480	4325580	for the new Batman Arkham City game
4325580	4329540	that are gonna be related to wherever you happen
4329540	4332600	to pre-order them from and there will be download content.
4332600	4334120	It's not, it hasn't said yet though
4334120	4336640	these are gonna be available to everybody,
4336640	4338640	maybe through a purchase or whatever.
4338640	4340200	But the different ones that they have
4340200	4343720	is that you can have the 1970s Batman skin,
4343720	4348720	which is through shop2.net and Toys R Us.
4349680	4352040	Shop2.net by the way is UK retailer.
4352920	4354600	You can get the Batman Beyond skin
4354600	4359440	through gamestop.co.uk or mightyape.co.nz.
4359440	4361760	That's New Zealand or UK.
4361760	4365340	You also get the Dark Knight Returns skin,
4365340	4368220	which will be if you buy it at any store,
4368220	4370660	if you buy the collector's edition at any store.
4370660	4372380	There's the animated series version
4372380	4374500	that is if you get it from Mighty Apes,
4374500	4376640	that's again New Zealand.
4376640	4379580	There's Earth One Batman, which is again through Mighty Ape.
4379580	4382580	And then there is the Robin Batman,
4382580	4386100	which is available through Best Buy or gamesmania.be,
4386100	4389660	which is Holland or JB Hi-Fi for Australia.
4389660	4391500	I want the Adam West Batman.
4391500	4392340	It's there.
4392340	4393160	It looks pretty cool.
4393160	4394000	I know.
4394000	4394840	Where do I get that in-
4394840	4395900	I'll leave the picture to the chat room.
4395900	4398260	Yeah, but where do I get that in America?
4398260	4399100	Pre-ordering that from.
4399100	4401860	That one is Toys R Us.
4401860	4403100	Okay, I can do that.
4403100	4404600	Like I said, the 1970s Batman.
4404600	4406180	I don't have burning hatred for Toys R Us,
4406180	4407020	so that'll work.
4408580	4409420	Besides-
4409420	4410260	It's actually more like the comic-
4410260	4411780	I can go be a Toys R Us kid.
4411780	4414460	It's more like the 1970s comic version,
4414460	4416460	but that was the same as the Adam West one.
4416460	4418060	Yeah, it's Adam West Batman to me.
4418060	4419180	That's the one I wanna play.
4419180	4421460	Except you know he doesn't have the drawn on eyebrows.
4421460	4422820	That or animated series.
4422820	4424460	I like the animated series one too.
4424460	4425280	It's pretty cool.
4425280	4426120	That's in there.
4426120	4428700	I gotta say that Michael Keaton one's kinda awesome too.
4428700	4429520	That one way on the right.
4429520	4430420	Is that Michael Keaton Batman?
4430420	4432380	The one on the far right is actually,
4432380	4434340	I do believe the Robin Batman.
4434340	4436100	No, that's on the far left, isn't it?
4436100	4437340	No, that's Batman Beyond.
4437340	4438420	Oh.
4438420	4440300	So in order on this one,
4440300	4441180	let me see if I get it right.
4441180	4442800	You have from left to right.
4442800	4444460	You have the Batman Beyond one.
4444460	4448940	You have the Dark Knight Returns.
4448940	4452540	You have Earth One 1970s animated series
4452540	4454000	and Robin's Batman.
4455220	4456540	Just keep in mind Dick Grayson
4456540	4457820	took over as Batman for a while.
4457820	4459220	You know who they have,
4459220	4461980	or know who one of the characters is gonna be
4461980	4464120	that they haven't announced yet, right?
4464120	4467520	Nightwing actually is gonna be one of the characters.
4467520	4468460	Which is awesome.
4468460	4470300	Shaping up to be more and more awesome.
4470300	4472580	Well then let me see something real quick.
4472580	4474000	Well I just wanna say quickly in our chat room,
4474000	4476820	Brakeman in the chat room at chat.orangelaunchy.com says,
4476820	4479320	can I get George Clooney Nipple Batman?
4479320	4481220	Actually I was incorrect.
4481220	4483640	Robin gets the Red Robin skin.
4483640	4484700	I was incorrect.
4485760	4487420	It's not, the picture of it's not available.
4487420	4491700	Red Robin as in the mascot for wonderful Burger Chain?
4491700	4492540	No.
4492540	4493700	Because that would be hilarious.
4494960	4497620	That's almost as cool as fighting as the Burger King.
4498660	4499780	I'm finding a picture.
4500680	4501940	There was a video that someone did,
4501940	4504300	a mock him of.
4504300	4507100	It was like the Burger King,
4507100	4508540	I don't even know what the fuck it was.
4508540	4510820	Somehow someone made the Burger King even creepier
4510820	4512980	and he was in oblivion.
4512980	4514300	Okay there's a picture in the chat room
4514300	4516780	of what Red Robin looks like from the comics.
4517920	4519760	You know I don't know if I could support
4519760	4521700	George Clooney Nipple Batman being in the game
4521700	4523980	because that means that Mr. Freeze might show up
4523980	4526020	and it might be really bad.
4526020	4527820	Allow me to break the ice.
4527820	4531900	Cold, freeze, cold, freeze, cold.
4531900	4534620	Frozen ice, cold gel.
4534620	4536900	Killing winter ice, winter ice.
4536900	4538820	Chill, cold ice, shut up.
4538820	4540740	Cold, freeze, chill, freeze.
4540740	4542700	Winter ice, cold, cold ice.
4542700	4544580	Crosswind ice, freezing ice.
4544580	4547820	Cool, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze.
4547820	4550700	Freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze.
4550700	4553620	Let's kick some ice.
4554460	4555980	That's the former governor of California
4555980	4557020	ladies and gentlemen.
4557020	4562020	I love that shit.
4564420	4568100	Okay I put in another picture of Batman versus Red Robin.
4568100	4570300	It's not quite showgirls bad though.
4570300	4571540	That's the problem.
4571540	4573860	Showgirls bad is so bad it's kind of good.
4573860	4575880	But that's just bad.
4577700	4578820	It's just awesome.
4580940	4583360	All right some quick plugs.
4583360	4586060	Check out one of our other shows we produce.
4586060	4588540	The Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth.
4588540	4590620	www.hoardhouse.com.
4590620	4591900	It's all things World of Warcraft.
4591900	4593340	Which funny enough we're actually getting
4593340	4595100	into a couple blizzard stories coming up here.
4595100	4597980	But there are things that go beyond just wow
4597980	4599580	and possibly affecting some other games too.
4599580	4601800	So a little bit of crossover tonight going on.
4601800	4604660	I do want to remind folks too that we are still recruiting
4604660	4607600	indie games to spotlight on the show.
4607600	4608760	We're gonna have a new segment.
4608760	4612600	I don't think it'll debut next week but maybe in two weeks.
4612600	4614540	We're gonna have a new segment dedicated to indie games
4614540	4615680	here on the show.
4615680	4618500	Very similar to kind of what we do for the classic games.
4618500	4620160	We're hoping to talk to some indie developers
4620160	4622460	and spotlight more indie games here on the show.
4622460	4624460	Obviously we've talked a lot about the Humble Indie Bundle
4624460	4626820	tonight which is a great place to start.
4626820	4628500	But we want to try and talk to some of the developers
4628500	4631740	themselves if you or anyone you know is developing
4631740	4635000	an indie game either for the PC, a homebrew thing,
4635000	4637980	maybe for the iOS or Xbox Live independent games.
4637980	4640740	I know it's very hard to stand out on Xbox Live
4640740	4641580	that's for sure.
4641580	4644300	So come get some exposure on Orange Lounge Radio.
4644300	4645460	We don't charge for it.
4645460	4646860	I don't think I made that clear last week
4646860	4649580	but it's we'll do it because we like your game
4649580	4651820	not because we're getting any money off it.
4651820	4653540	So email us.
4653540	4656840	You can email the show at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
4656840	4658860	or you can get into contact with us on Twitter
4658860	4660360	at twitter.com slash O-L-R.
4660360	4661700	You can email me directly if you want.
4661700	4662900	Rob at orangeloungeradio.com
4662900	4664180	because I'll be producing the new segment.
4664180	4666740	So it'll be fun.
4666740	4667860	All right, moving on.
4667860	4669500	Let's get into some other news.
4669500	4671840	And I mentioned Blizzard a minute ago.
4671840	4673660	There's some big stuff that came out of Blizzard
4673660	4675380	on an earnings call this week, right Loki?
4675380	4677760	And it's just where Blizzard goes,
4677760	4681300	the industry may in fact follow, correct?
4681300	4682140	Yeah.
4682140	4688260	So they announced a few things about Diablo 3.
4688260	4691740	First off, Diablo 3 is going to feature player
4691740	4695500	to player real money auction houses as well
4695500	4697340	for virtual items.
4697340	4702980	So you're going to be able to play this game, find items
4702980	4706220	or whatever, and then sell them for real money or I think
4706220	4708060	in-game currency as well.
4708060	4709820	I think you'll be given the option either.
4709820	4712700	And Blizzard will take fixed fees.
4712700	4715020	They didn't say what it is, but they'll be nominal.
4715020	4720780	And out of the sale price, both when the auction goes up
4720780	4724620	for sale and when it's sold, and then when an item's sold,
4724620	4727520	players will be able to keep their money in a Battle.net
4727520	4731540	account for spending on Blizzard products and services
4731540	4735620	are cashed out entirely with another percentage-based fee,
4735620	4738180	although not yet announced, third-party payment provider.
4743180	4745020	Yeah, that's interesting.
4745020	4749340	Then, you know, if that's not good enough,
4749340	4753500	Diablo 3 is going to require a permanent online connection.
4753500	4755660	That's right.
4755660	4758300	You're not going to be able to play the single-player portion
4758300	4761820	of the game unless you are connected to Battle.net.
4765140	4767660	One of the things that they felt was really important
4767660	4770260	was that if you did play offline,
4770260	4772620	you start a character, you get them all the way to level 20
4772620	4776020	or 30 or 40 or what have you, and then at some point
4776020	4777660	you might decide to venture onto Battle.net.
4777660	4780020	But if you had to start a character from scratch,
4780020	4782460	because there's no way for us to guarantee no cheats were
4782460	4785700	involved, if we let you play on the client
4785700	4788820	and then take the character online.
4788820	4791380	So basically, their whole thing is,
4791380	4792780	if you're connected to Battle.net,
4792780	4797100	there must be no way that you can cheat at all.
4797100	4800420	Well, it certainly would be a lot harder, that's for sure.
4800420	4803900	I mean, exploits will be found in the game one way or another.
4803900	4807240	But this is tricky.
4807240	4809380	Obviously, I have to watch Blizzard very closely,
4809380	4811740	because I spend a lot of time playing World of Warcraft.
4811740	4815620	I will buy Diablo 3, because I loved Diablo 2.
4815620	4818180	In some ways, the reason why I like World of Warcraft so much
4818180	4820180	is that it almost plays more like Diablo than it
4820180	4823540	does the RTS Warcraft games.
4823540	4825900	So this is all news that definitely impacts,
4825900	4828980	relevant to my interests, as they say.
4828980	4831060	So I think a large part of what they're
4831060	4834500	doing with the online connectivity and the fact
4834500	4837660	that they say you can't cheat or whatever,
4837660	4840620	is that they do have huge problems in Diablo 2,
4840620	4845700	with folks cloning items and buying characters
4845700	4851300	that are made in China and so forth by shady ways,
4851300	4854180	getting the characters all leveled up, cheating, duping
4854180	4856280	is a huge thing, and hacking and so forth.
4856280	4857700	That game has been hacked to shit.
4857700	4859700	And it makes a lot of people not want to play online,
4859700	4861780	because the experience is just screwed up.
4861780	4864500	Think about, if that becomes a problem,
4864500	4867500	it's going to screw up their entire game, because yeah,
4867500	4869420	OK, we're assuming that, or they're
4869420	4871800	making the assumption that if it's connected to the battle
4871800	4877740	now all the time, that's going to eliminate cheating.
4877740	4879280	I don't think that's possible.
4879280	4880660	I don't think it's going to eliminate cheating,
4880660	4882020	but it's going to cut it way, way, way, way back.
4882020	4883020	Well, you're going to have a problem, though,
4883020	4884780	with people, if they're duplicating items
4884780	4886980	and they're selling them for real money.
4886980	4888380	But they're not going to be able to duplicate items,
4888380	4889340	because they're always connected.
4889340	4890860	And the system is going to look out for that shit
4890860	4891780	and ban them instantly.
4891780	4892700	You never know.
4892700	4896500	The real problem is people that buy this shit.
4896500	4898940	Like, if you buy gold for these games,
4898940	4900420	or you've bought one of these characters,
4900420	4902580	you're part of the reason this is happening.
4902580	4904180	And let's be real, you've probably
4904180	4905540	had your credit card stolen, too,
4905540	4908420	because a lot of those companies like to do both.
4908420	4910540	They sell you the info and then sell your credit card
4910540	4912180	information to somebody else.
4912180	4913900	But whatever.
4913900	4916940	Makes you happy, I guess.
4916940	4917520	I don't know.
4917520	4919660	And then the whole real money auction house thing
4919660	4923980	is just the weirdest thing I've ever heard in my life.
4923980	4927320	At the same time, if people weren't buying this shit
4927320	4929460	somewhere else, they wouldn't have
4929460	4931100	to do something like this, I guess.
4931100	4933140	I think they're just trying to get a slice of it.
4933140	4935780	But here's the weird thing about it for me.
4935780	4937220	Well, A, I'm never going to use it.
4937220	4939300	I will not use the real money auction house,
4939300	4941060	because I don't really want to support it.
4941060	4943100	And A, I don't want to buy this stuff on there.
4943100	4944380	It seems ridiculous.
4944380	4946780	And B, Blizzard's going to charge a listing fee
4946780	4947900	if you sell.
4947900	4949940	Like, part of me wonders if Blizzard isn't going
4949940	4952420	to profit off false dreams.
4952420	4954060	That they're going to profit off people
4954060	4957220	trying to list all these items for sale that will never sell.
4957220	4958540	I know a lot of people that are saying,
4958540	4961260	yeah, I'll sell items on there and make money.
4961260	4964340	I don't hear anyone say, I'll buy the items off there
4964340	4965180	and make money.
4965180	4967500	Well, here's some other things that you need to consider too.
4969820	4973300	This listing amount of money, or whatever they're taking,
4973300	4976160	I can guarantee it's not an in-game currency.
4977460	4978980	So that means you're going to have to have
4978980	4980820	your credit card in there somewhere.
4983340	4984180	Maybe that's not a big deal.
4984180	4986600	Which you already do if you play WoW anyway.
4986600	4989260	So, you know, Battle.net probably has it already.
4989260	4991820	And a lot of people that are going to come play Diablo 3
4991820	4994180	are probably already playing WoW.
4994180	4996180	So, the weird thing is, you know,
4996180	4998400	I know Blizzard has swore up and down
4998400	5000400	they have their legal asses covered.
5000400	5001780	So whatever, that's fine.
5001780	5005100	But it strikes me as very odd
5005100	5006640	that let's say, hypothetically,
5006640	5009500	somebody could sell enough items
5009500	5011580	that they make a significant amount of money on this.
5011580	5012800	I don't think anybody's going to make more
5012800	5014260	than maybe 20 bucks on this stuff.
5014260	5017540	But let's say somebody does make a fair amount of money
5017540	5018740	off some of these items.
5019700	5022700	Wouldn't they have to claim taxes on that at some point?
5022700	5024660	Like, wouldn't forms have to be filed by Blizzard,
5024660	5026220	or I guess whoever their third party is,
5026220	5027980	that they're going to get involved on some of that?
5027980	5029740	Can you be taxed on not real items?
5029740	5032940	And then that's where the whole internet gambling thing
5032940	5036140	comes into play is that there's no fine,
5036140	5040980	I mean, Blizzard controls the drop rate of these items
5040980	5042220	that they're then going to turn around
5042220	5043320	and charge you to sell.
5043320	5047540	Something about that seems really devious to me.
5047540	5052060	Like, there's not a check and balance to that.
5052060	5053380	Like, Blizzard is going to control-
5053380	5054540	It's insider trading.
5054540	5056900	Yeah, that's what it is, it's insider trading.
5056900	5058840	Like, that's legal?
5059740	5061580	Okay, I think it's only legal
5061580	5063060	because it hasn't really been done yet.
5063060	5066420	But I think this is going to catch somebody's eye.
5066420	5068320	This is going to catch the eye of a Leland Yee
5068320	5071580	or somebody out there that's wanting, you know,
5071580	5073300	the same way online gambling did.
5073300	5074140	They're just-
5074140	5076180	It just doesn't add up to me.
5078540	5079500	SHA100Matt says,
5079500	5081700	"'Rob, this is the same company that got a ton of suckers
5081700	5083460	"'to pay $20 for a dumb mount on.'"
5083460	5084900	Wow, true.
5084900	5085740	Very true.
5086660	5088220	I never bought the dumb mount, just so you know.
5088220	5090140	The only thing I ever bought were the charity pets.
5090140	5091940	They were charity, just so you know.
5094380	5095200	But,
5097540	5100220	I know some people who did buy those mounts
5100220	5101180	and they quite enjoy them.
5101180	5103540	They spend a lot of money on them.
5103540	5105780	And at the same time, I'm not going to tell a person
5105780	5107140	what they should and shouldn't spend their money on
5107140	5109140	to make them happy, right?
5109140	5112620	And if a fake little star pony that flies
5112620	5114220	makes you happy, then go for it.
5116140	5118860	I wouldn't pay for tower bucks and tiny tower either,
5118860	5120520	but I still play the game.
5120520	5121360	Yeah.
5122220	5123660	I don't know.
5123660	5126420	Let's see, going into some other comments from chat,
5127600	5128480	Dungeon Buster says,
5128480	5131100	"'I'm surprised that they didn't opt to let players into making
5131100	5134380	a separate profile for off an online play.'"
5134380	5136540	Me too, but maybe they were worried about things like
5136540	5141540	blurring the lines or whatever, and leave it open to abuse.
5141700	5143260	Shlace's pop in chat says,
5143260	5145380	"'That issue has come up before with Second Life,
5145380	5148560	where people were making tangible income for digital goods
5148560	5151540	on their skins, house, digital assets design
5151540	5152820	that they put the time into making
5152820	5154500	and then selling on PayPal.
5154500	5156580	The IRS had no idea what to do with it.'
5156580	5158060	But you can look up news articles about it.
5158060	5160660	It was a big deal when Second Life was still relevant."
5163460	5166580	Yeah, I'm really interested to see where this goes.
5166580	5167420	I don't know.
5167420	5168240	Well, here's my thing.
5168240	5170460	And this is with the whole IRS stuff.
5170460	5174700	If they're gonna tax you on in-game currency that you make,
5174700	5176300	then I should be able to pay those taxes
5176300	5177740	with in-game currency.
5177740	5179460	Because that's always been the problem.
5179460	5181700	They're trying to associate a value to this stuff.
5181700	5182820	Like say, for example,
5182820	5187020	I sell some items in Diablo 3
5187020	5192020	and earn 20,000 Blizzard space bucks
5192300	5195340	or whatever they're gonna be under there.
5195340	5200000	And then somehow that translates to $15,000
5200000	5200840	or something like that.
5200840	5202500	But if I never cash that stuff out,
5202500	5204820	I mean, it's digital.
5204820	5207540	It's not really worth that kind of money.
5207540	5210000	But if they're gonna charge me that,
5210000	5212220	then why should I have to pay in real money
5212220	5214340	if it's not real money that I'm earning?
5214340	5215860	You know what I mean?
5215860	5216700	Well, keep in mind there are
5216700	5219100	the two completely separate auction houses.
5219100	5220580	And there's gonna be the auction house
5220580	5222620	that runs completely off in-game currency.
5222620	5223660	I'll use that.
5223660	5224500	Why not?
5224500	5226460	I use it and wow, it's a great system.
5226460	5227560	I like it.
5227560	5229820	I don't pay real money to use it.
5229820	5231200	Besides, I guess one could argue
5231200	5232700	my monthly subscription fee.
5232700	5234140	And that's something we got into talking about
5234140	5235980	on Hoard House this week is that
5235980	5238580	before you cash out through this third party vendor,
5238580	5240820	the dollar and cents is in your Blizzard wallet
5240820	5241860	for lack of a better term.
5241860	5243700	We don't know exactly what it's called yet.
5243700	5246380	You could essentially pay for your monthly wow fee
5246380	5248340	off selling games in Diablo.
5248340	5250260	Because you could use the money in your Blizzard wallet
5250260	5252220	to buy other Blizzard services.
5252220	5255320	So somebody could fund their wow by playing Diablo
5255320	5256180	and selling the items.
5256180	5259500	But again, that's assuming there's a market for buyers.
5259500	5260740	Does anyone out there in chat
5260740	5262060	wanna say that they'll be using this
5262060	5264300	to buy items to give them an advantage?
5264300	5266860	Will you drop $3 to get an epic purple
5266860	5269240	or whatever color they are in Diablo
5269240	5270580	to give you an edge in the game?
5270580	5273260	Or are you like, fuck that, I'll earn it?
5273260	5275220	I bet you most people sitting in this room
5275220	5277200	are probably like, fuck that, I'll earn it.
5277200	5278040	I'm guessing.
5278040	5278860	I know that's where I'm coming from.
5278860	5280540	Fuck that, I'll cheat.
5280540	5282500	You can't, you have to be online all the time.
5282500	5283580	Oh, no, no, no, no.
5283580	5285420	That's why you're mad, because you can't cheat.
5285420	5286540	Oh, I'm not mad.
5286540	5288580	I just think that it's a bold statement
5288580	5290300	to say that you can't cheat.
5290300	5291940	There is no can't, okay?
5291940	5292980	It will happen.
5292980	5294260	There will be a way.
5296420	5299020	And then they'll be like, we ban you.
5299020	5303300	You banned me from Diablo.
5303300	5305420	RDG Singe in chat says,
5305420	5308040	how about playing Diablo 3 for fun?
5308040	5310260	Do people still do that?
5310260	5312260	I hope so, that's my plan.
5312260	5315040	I don't really want to play Diablo 3 with strangers either.
5315040	5317940	I'll be playing co-op with friends, and that's it.
5318780	5320740	Maybe, OLR people would count as friends
5320740	5322300	if you wanted to play Diablo 3.
5322300	5324700	We go on a co-op mission together.
5324700	5326580	But I'm still looking forward to playing the game,
5326580	5329660	and the online connection part doesn't really bother me
5329660	5332060	so much, you kind of need it for StarCraft 2.
5332060	5334980	I mean, I think technically you don't have to have one
5334980	5339420	for StarCraft 2, but the game is much more rich with one,
5339420	5342700	and seeing as Blizzard is very online centered
5342700	5343740	with their achievements and everything now,
5343740	5346060	this news doesn't really surprise me.
5346060	5347220	I don't think Blizzard,
5347220	5349020	Diablo isn't really something I'd want to try
5349020	5350340	and play on the go anyway,
5350340	5353080	or somewhere that I can't have an internet connection.
5353080	5356180	You can have internet connections on planes now, you know?
5356180	5357020	I don't know.
5357020	5357840	But I get, I-
5357840	5359740	Yeah, but not an internet connection to run that game.
5359740	5362740	But I get, I am being a little bit of a hypocrite.
5362740	5363580	I get it.
5363580	5364780	I mean, I'm admit that,
5364780	5367960	because I'm okay with what Blizzard's doing here,
5367960	5370740	but yet I'm not okay with Ubisoft doing it with Driver.
5370740	5372380	I think it's ridiculous.
5372380	5376700	But, from what I understand, the single player of Driver
5376700	5378740	doesn't have any online elements.
5378740	5380660	The single player version of this game
5380660	5384660	now does have a real money auction house involved,
5384660	5386360	where people could be making money off of it.
5386360	5388940	And I guess they've got to protect the environment.
5388940	5390600	And heaven forbid somebody does cheat,
5390600	5392260	and now this turns into like real money.
5392260	5394900	That's when it's going to be a legal problem.
5394900	5398540	Blizzard better hope that having everybody connected 24 seven
5398540	5400020	really does keep out the cheaters.
5400020	5402400	And they better really be watching that shit like a hawk.
5402400	5403980	Because if somebody is able to exploit
5403980	5406740	that real money system, it's over.
5406740	5407840	You know what I mean?
5409060	5409900	So.
5411300	5412720	All right.
5412720	5414660	Let's move on to news that came out about the next
5414660	5416360	wow expansion.
5416360	5418780	So, Dark Soccer, I know, right?
5418780	5421060	You've been playing this for a while.
5421060	5421900	The rumor.
5423520	5426080	I laugh every time I think about it.
5426080	5428600	The name apparently that has been registered
5428600	5431300	for the next expansion, verified by MMO Trampion
5431300	5434500	with trademarks and so forth, is Mists of Pandaria.
5434500	5436060	Mop.
5436060	5437980	Or the mop expansion.
5437980	5441680	Pandarias, of course, are named for the pandaren.
5441680	5444440	Living, breathing, walking, talking panda bears
5444440	5446180	that made their way into wow culture
5446180	5449540	as part of an April Fool's joke and never left.
5449540	5451500	Yes, you can get the pandaren monk.
5451500	5453560	That's one of the charity pets
5453560	5455060	that actually they sold there.
5456020	5459080	The trademark was apparently registered July 28th.
5459080	5462020	And it could be that this is going to be out in time
5462020	5464440	for Blizzcon, not the expansion itself,
5464440	5466740	but more news on it will come out at Blizzcon.
5468220	5470660	I guess that the rumors say pandarens
5470660	5472700	will be a playable race,
5472700	5474700	that you'll get to go to level 90, of course.
5474700	5476860	A monk hero class.
5476860	5479400	As you know, panda bears are all monks.
5479400	5482100	Well, we had some discussion on this in guild chat
5482100	5483120	not too long ago.
5485060	5487740	In fact, I believe that I, it was,
5487740	5489460	Miklotov was amongst the people
5489460	5491900	because that's who I heard about it from.
5491900	5495000	But we were talking about other possibilities
5495000	5499500	that it could be like the ruins of the pandaren empire,
5499500	5501620	that perhaps there's only a few left
5501620	5504260	and you learned to become a monk from one of them.
5504260	5506020	Because we'd just gotten you races.
5507220	5510300	So it could just be that you're exploring their culture
5510300	5513420	like they're, who are the freaking walrus people again?
5513420	5514240	Kaluak.
5514240	5516460	Yeah, I like the walrus people.
5516460	5518020	They're cool, they remind me of Wilford Brimley.
5518020	5519420	Kuch Kuch.
5519420	5521400	No, they all look like Wilford Brimley.
5521400	5522240	Anyway.
5523800	5528380	But I mean, it could be that you just get to visit
5528380	5530420	the pandarens and you learn from them.
5530420	5532700	So you get a monk class and maybe,
5532700	5535200	like you were saying level 90,
5535200	5537420	or, you know, we get more goody items.
5537420	5540480	But I mean, I would personally like to, you know,
5540480	5544600	have another reason to do five more levels worth of quests.
5546060	5547900	My favorite theory about this though,
5547900	5550620	is that this is just a Facebook or an IOS game.
5550620	5551740	It's a spinoff game.
5551740	5553820	God, I hope that's the case.
5553820	5555740	That would be much more understandable.
5555740	5557060	I don't know.
5557060	5559180	I'm okay with the whole archeology idea.
5559180	5560940	I call that the archeology concept,
5560940	5563380	that you're trying to figure out why the pandarens got,
5563380	5564980	you know, all murdered.
5564980	5566900	I just don't want to see everybody playing
5566900	5568060	a walking, talking panda bear,
5568060	5568900	cause that's getting a little ridiculous.
5568900	5572060	I really don't think that we're going to get them as a race,
5572060	5576420	because I mean, it's like every fourth expansion
5576420	5579580	or every even numbered expansion now has,
5579580	5582380	I mean, two, there's only been four versions,
5582380	5584580	has had a new race added.
5584580	5587740	It was a new area.
5587740	5589300	Each one's had a new area open.
5589300	5591660	So I think that this one's just going to be a new area
5591660	5593900	and a new, cause all right, let me look at it.
5593900	5594740	Real quick.
5594740	5595840	Miklotov's correcting me in chat.
5595840	5598220	The walrus people are the Tuskar.
5598220	5600660	I guess the Kaluak is the faction.
5600660	5601780	My bad.
5603580	5605740	Anyway, you know, we got the first one,
5605740	5608080	introducing the world and everything,
5608080	5610380	blah, blah, blah, boring.
5610380	5611460	Cause it was.
5611460	5615020	And then you get the burning crusades.
5615020	5617660	You get two new races, one for each side.
5617660	5619960	Demons, demons, and more demons.
5621860	5626380	You get space goats and pretty blood elves.
5626380	5628980	And you're fighting demons and fire.
5629920	5631520	The, what was the burning Legion?
5631520	5632860	And you have to learn to fly.
5632860	5633700	Yeah.
5633700	5635740	The burning Legion sounds like something you have to take
5635740	5637420	antibiotics for.
5637420	5638260	It's a salve.
5639260	5641100	And then, okay, the next one you get basically,
5641100	5644300	a new character class and a new area.
5644300	5646720	So then when we get cataclysm,
5646720	5650140	it was against two new races and a new area.
5650140	5651500	And the whole world gets fucked up
5651500	5653700	and the game gets made fun.
5653700	5656660	So it would logically stand to reason
5656660	5658460	that if they're establishing a pattern,
5658460	5662220	then you'll be getting a new area and a new class.
5662220	5664280	And it could possibly be, okay,
5664280	5666940	what was the level cap for,
5668560	5669400	for a,
5669400	5670220	Wrath of the Lich King?
5670220	5671060	80.
5671060	5671880	Burning Crusade.
5671880	5672720	70.
5672720	5673560	70.
5673560	5674980	You start off with a 55 character on,
5674980	5676900	you know, with a level seven,
5676900	5679220	coming from a level 70 cap.
5679220	5682100	So given that the current cap right now is 85,
5682100	5684980	I would think that maybe monks start off as a level 70
5684980	5685820	or something like that.
5685820	5686660	Perhaps.
5686660	5688540	Actually, you know what else Wrath of the Lich King had?
5688540	5691380	It had lots and lots and tons and tons of ice.
5692500	5694300	Allow me to break the ice.
5694300	5695260	Cold.
5695260	5696100	Freeze.
5696100	5696920	Cold.
5696920	5697760	Freeze.
5697760	5698600	Cold.
5698600	5699700	Frozen ice.
5699700	5701140	Cold.
5701140	5701980	Killing winter.
5701980	5702820	I say.
5702820	5703660	It's actually the Lich King.
5705060	5706100	Talking.
5706100	5707420	Arthas, that bitch.
5710440	5712380	I'm gonna draw that, you know.
5712380	5713220	What?
5713220	5714380	Okay, when I made my death knight,
5714380	5716100	and I think you were there for that.
5716100	5717220	When I finally made a death knight
5717220	5719420	that was actually gonna play as a tank.
5719420	5721220	I just was looking,
5721220	5722500	cause I played a draw knight and you know,
5722500	5724540	they're tall and skinny.
5724540	5725580	Next to Arthas,
5725580	5728100	who's just really big and stout.
5728100	5730540	And I said, Arthas got to be a fat bitch.
5731660	5733000	And I think it was,
5734820	5735820	it was some,
5735820	5737380	of course somebody in our guild said
5737380	5739380	it was all those cookies.
5739380	5740500	But Arthas likes cookies.
5740500	5743380	So I was gonna draw a picture of Arthas
5743380	5746700	lounged out like Jabba the Hutt eating cookies.
5746700	5749340	Saying, let's kick some ice.
5749340	5750900	I should do that.
5750900	5752540	Anyway.
5752540	5754420	So Pandaria,
5754420	5755440	yay or nay?
5755440	5759000	I'm all for something new.
5759000	5760080	I'm kinda, whatever.
5760080	5761320	Blizzard's gonna do what they're gonna do
5761320	5762480	and I can't really control it.
5762480	5764480	But Firelands has been kinda,
5764480	5767340	eh, burn, depressing.
5767340	5770200	Look, they can send us to,
5770200	5771440	you know,
5771440	5772720	they can send us to play with.
5772720	5774040	To the land of pee.
5774040	5775800	We can go to Keyboard Cat,
5775800	5778800	who lives in the land of pee, pee, pee, pee, pee.
5778800	5779840	I don't really care.
5779840	5784620	Like as long as it doesn't have that horribly steep curve
5784620	5787280	into raiding and doing all that stuff that Cataclysm did,
5787280	5789140	as long as it's more accessible,
5789140	5790520	I think as long as it just plays more like
5790520	5793040	Wrath of the Lich King, to be honest,
5793040	5794540	I think it'll be fine.
5794540	5795380	Well,
5797480	5799720	now that I'm raiding, I really like it.
5799720	5801760	I think that more people,
5801760	5803360	it should definitely, there should be,
5803360	5806240	maybe they'll incorporate easier raids.
5806240	5808020	Like, beginning raids.
5808960	5810100	Mikolatov in chat says,
5810100	5815100	I don't get all the hate for this being a possible expansion.
5840740	5842900	I just don't like them that much,
5842900	5845340	or I need them in my Warcraft, you know?
5845340	5847020	And maybe the Pandarens are actually
5847020	5849100	a magical illusion of panda bears,
5849100	5852100	and they really look like, not like space goats.
5853940	5856320	For the record, space goats are the best.
5856320	5858740	All right, enough wow talk.
5858740	5859980	Space goat.
5859980	5861780	I got another show for wow talk,
5861780	5862780	and I think we've had plenty,
5862780	5865400	but remember, where Blizzard goes,
5865400	5866900	a lot of these PC games will follow,
5866900	5868900	especially this whole persistent online connection.
5868900	5870780	I think it's gonna be really interesting
5870780	5874620	how people are gonna borderline forgive Blizzard, maybe.
5874620	5876060	I think there's definitely some people
5876060	5877780	hating Blizzard over this decision,
5877780	5880020	but there's a lot more hating Ubisoft over theirs,
5880020	5882160	so it's very interesting.
5882160	5883580	Let's move on to the email bag, though.
5883580	5886020	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
5887300	5889020	Every week you email us,
5889020	5891440	and we might read them here on air,
5891440	5895060	if Dark Soccer is feeling saucy or burpy.
5895060	5897060	Hey, I just have the mic up.
5897060	5899460	She's going to read some emails for you right now.
5899460	5901260	You better be nice to me, I gave you ice cream.
5901260	5902940	You did give me ice cream, it was delicious.
5902940	5904820	I found Samoa's ice cream.
5904820	5906900	It was really fucking good, y'all.
5906900	5909220	So the first email here,
5909220	5912000	while looking at the disused televisions in the basement,
5912000	5915220	I was inspired to ask again, Jamie, that was to me,
5915220	5916260	does the vault have a collection
5916260	5918300	of older television sets as well?
5918300	5919140	No.
5920460	5921860	I'm sure someone has to make adapters
5921860	5924960	to hook up Atari 2600 or Odyssey to HDMI,
5924960	5927060	but do you prefer the original sets?
5927060	5930180	The only way I can really play the Odyssey
5930180	5931380	is to hook up to the original sets,
5931380	5934540	but all of our other systems will work with the modern TVs.
5935540	5936860	They make different adapters.
5936860	5939700	You don't have to use the little prongs to make it work.
5939700	5942660	I was gonna say, can't you get an RF adapter
5942660	5945460	at Radio Shack that will change it to RCAs?
5945460	5947040	Yeah, you can get an adapter.
5947040	5948940	Just the one problem is that I think, actually,
5948940	5953460	since the Odyssey was from, I wanna say, like,
5953460	5956260	81 or something like that,
5956260	5960460	it really, there's no way to make it work with a newer TV.
5960460	5962380	Also, I think you might expose yourself
5962380	5965540	to some shitty lag if you use the converters.
5965540	5967740	I don't really do this in my house,
5967740	5968580	so I couldn't tell you,
5968580	5971260	but I think you do open yourself up to lag issues.
5971260	5972600	I'll take some pictures in the vault,
5972600	5975580	but we actually, right now, have a couple of TVs
5975580	5979140	from just little small HD monitors that were
5979140	5984140	obtained from the destruction of a video game chain
5988020	5989640	that I won't talk about,
5991500	5996500	that they were Xbox 360 demo units.
5997020	5998860	We got monitors from them.
5998860	5999860	So that's what we have hooked up
5999860	6001000	with a couple of Switch boxes.
6001000	6006000	So we have about eight systems hooked up in the other room,
6006820	6008780	eight or nine, something like that,
6008780	6010280	hooked up to these TVs.
6011920	6014180	I mean, really, to be honest,
6014180	6015980	we have two games on the Odyssey
6015980	6018260	that I really have an interest in playing,
6018260	6019960	so we don't really bother hooking it up.
6019960	6021020	And again, like I said,
6021020	6023160	we don't have anything to hook it up to.
6023160	6024660	All the other ones, no problem.
6024660	6026100	We can hook them up to just about anything,
6026100	6028300	although I really do think that,
6028300	6030440	actually, I don't think that we've tried the Atari
6030440	6033280	on an HDTV.
6033280	6036100	I think that last time we played one of our Ataris,
6036100	6038340	we actually did have a CRT.
6038340	6039340	Oh, well.
6039340	6040500	It's not like it's that hard
6040500	6043460	to go find a CRT monitor anymore.
6044880	6046500	I can go to the thrift store.
6046500	6048380	Oh, look, a TV, rabbit ears.
6049540	6051300	Also, I apologize for any confusion
6051300	6052300	about last week's email
6052300	6054600	regarding the voices of multiplayer games.
6054600	6056980	My use of the term character was somewhat misleading.
6056980	6059300	I meant specifically the volumes of online players
6059300	6061020	speaking through their player characters,
6061020	6062660	not those of the NPCs.
6062660	6063860	Thanks again, Robert M.
6065840	6068260	I think we did address that, though.
6068260	6071440	I think we were leaning towards the NPC answer,
6071440	6074100	but I thought I had brought up something
6074100	6077300	that the characters did sound further away,
6077300	6080320	but I can't remember, off the top of my head,
6080320	6081940	what it was.
6081940	6083540	Keep in mind, a lot of MMOs,
6083540	6087200	you don't really do voice chat through the MMO itself,
6087200	6089820	and those are actually kind of hard to find,
6089820	6090980	the games where that happens,
6090980	6093900	because yes, you have voice chat in WoW,
6093900	6095020	but nobody uses it.
6095020	6097380	I'm telling you, nobody uses it.
6097380	6098940	I didn't even know it was there.
6098940	6101340	And it's not in the public chat channels, anyway.
6102740	6104340	Okay, ooh, we have one from Sil.
6105820	6106660	Ready?
6107580	6108420	Yes.
6108420	6109700	Hi, guys, I hope all of you are doing well.
6109700	6110700	A few days ago, I bought
6110700	6113340	Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines through Steam.
6113340	6115060	Of course, it didn't want to work properly,
6115060	6118580	and I had to download a patch through the Steam forums.
6118580	6120660	In a way, I thought it would have been nice
6120660	6122760	if Steam would just patch it themselves.
6122760	6124540	Then again, I'm not that technical,
6124540	6126220	and it might not be possible.
6126220	6127740	Anyhow, I started to play this game,
6127740	6129420	and even if it is an older game,
6129420	6130900	I really love the story.
6130900	6132680	The options where you can choose how to respond
6132680	6135640	and that it actually has an effect on the story of the game
6135640	6137380	is something that I really enjoy.
6137380	6138720	It makes me want to replay the game
6138720	6141340	and try different things just to see how the story changes.
6141340	6142940	Perhaps I'm also just happy to see
6142940	6144560	some proper blood-sucking vampires
6144560	6147020	instead of the woo me and my curse and stare at you
6147020	6148420	while you're sleeping glittery twats
6148420	6150580	that seem to be ruling the media now.
6150580	6151420	I love her.
6151420	6155940	For the record, the email's titled non-sparkly vampires.
6157140	6159700	Did you ever start playing a game
6159700	6162040	thinking it would be okay, but nothing mind-blowing,
6162040	6164380	but the more you played it, the more you loved it?
6164380	6165440	Guardian legend?
6166460	6167700	Because when you start playing that game,
6167700	6169300	it's like, oh, I'm shooting shit.
6169300	6170860	Whoa, there's an RPG!
6172820	6175020	I get, restate the question for me real quick.
6175020	6176900	Have you ever started a game
6176900	6179600	thinking that it would be okay, but nothing mind-blowing,
6179600	6181380	but the more you played it, the more you loved it?
6181380	6182660	Ooh.
6182660	6184040	Mr. Final Fantasy 13?
6185460	6187660	But those games, I kinda already had the bar set high.
6187660	6188740	I'm really trying to think of something
6188740	6190460	kinda outside the norm.
6190460	6192140	Let me think on that for a minute.
6193300	6196020	I'm trying to think of any others.
6197560	6199740	Actually, when I got back into WoW.
6199740	6201560	Yeah, I gotta say, World of Warcraft
6201560	6203380	actually kinda jumps out at me.
6204300	6205300	When I first played WoW,
6205300	6206660	I didn't think it was really all that,
6206660	6208180	and I didn't think I was gonna get that into it,
6208180	6210260	but when all my friends were playing,
6210260	6212180	and it became a lot more of a chat room
6212180	6214180	with fire spells and swords, so to speak,
6214180	6216000	I think that was actually a game.
6216940	6218620	Well, for me, when I started questing.
6219620	6222400	I guess you could say VVVVV that I played this week.
6222400	6225120	I didn't think I was gonna like it as much as I did.
6226140	6228340	Well, I knew I was gonna like Portal 2,
6228340	6230700	but I didn't know that I'd like it as much as I did.
6230700	6233960	So, yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of games,
6233960	6235080	but I'm still loving this show,
6235080	6237940	and I'm still waiting for my biscuits, Rob.
6237940	6238900	I'll work on that.
6238900	6241140	They're with the tea and crumpets.
6241140	6243220	So, PS, if you're an MMO player,
6243220	6244720	you'll love the attached image, I hope.
6244720	6245860	Okay, let's have a look.
6246980	6249420	The Nine Circles of MMO Hell.
6249420	6251020	You know what, I'm actually gonna save this
6251020	6253080	and post it on our...
6253080	6253920	Tumblr.
6253920	6254740	Tumblr.
6254740	6255580	There you go.
6255580	6256420	Okay, so let me just save.
6256420	6257900	Orangelandsradio.tumblr.com.
6257900	6261260	Image, I'll do MMO Hell.
6261260	6262960	You could do it after the mailbag statement.
6262960	6264100	I'm just saving the image,
6264100	6266460	because I'm gonna close the email.
6266460	6269280	So, bite my behind, Rob.
6269280	6270420	You ready?
6270420	6271940	Newsflash!
6271940	6274340	The tester season three is casting, info below.
6274340	6276700	I'll be watching, not auditioning, Rob-a-buh.
6276700	6278420	Oh, yes, I heard about this on Twitter this week,
6278420	6279920	and I sent it over to Lokey-O-L-R,
6279920	6281020	and I was like, Lokey,
6281020	6282620	weren't you saying something about
6282620	6284900	you'd like to try a new career?
6284900	6286760	Well, I will link it in the chat room,
6286760	6288540	and if any of you make it on there,
6288540	6291220	plug the crap out of us.
6291220	6293100	Actually, I wanna say,
6294340	6296220	they were saying that the prize for the winner
6296220	6298940	this season isn't like a testing thing,
6298940	6301980	it's like actually a role in production.
6301980	6303580	So, they're kinda up in the ante
6303580	6305100	on prize this year a little bit.
6305100	6306940	Okay, Jamie's trying out.
6306940	6308020	For real?
6308020	6308860	Why not?
6308860	6309680	Oh my God, you should.
6309680	6310780	Oh my God.
6310780	6312740	Sign up now, why not?
6312740	6314220	Look into it, and see if the prize
6314220	6315580	is something you'd actually want.
6315580	6317020	Well, because if they can get me in
6317020	6320200	as any level of art production.
6320200	6321040	Yeah, I-
6321040	6322020	That's just my career, right there.
6322020	6325380	I believe the prize is like actual,
6325380	6327460	on the production team this time.
6327460	6329940	And it better not be pee-on,
6329940	6332040	because I actually have some skills to offer.
6332040	6333560	You know what, if you start as pee-on
6333560	6335260	for like two months, you'll probably move up real quick.
6335260	6337540	That guy who won the first season of the tester
6337540	6339860	only tested for like a couple months,
6339860	6342020	and now he does marketing stuff.
6342020	6343380	So...
6343380	6344900	Dude, wouldn't that be crazy?
6346900	6348480	You know what, Dark Soccer, if you try out
6348480	6351180	and you get your little thing online or whatever,
6351180	6352740	I'll help you make your video.
6352740	6355400	Okay.
6355400	6356580	But you, wait, wait, wait, wait.
6356580	6358180	You used to, wait, hold on, hold on,
6358180	6360120	cause I just gotta, okay.
6361060	6362820	If I'm not mistaking, Dark Soccer,
6362820	6365260	you hate reality television,
6365260	6366980	and for a long time on this program,
6366980	6369780	you never wanted to be on video, correct?
6369780	6370620	Yes.
6370620	6373740	So you are now auditioning for a reality TV show.
6373740	6376420	Am I understanding correctly?
6376420	6379300	If a job comes out of it, me, who is currently jobless.
6380180	6382420	Rob, you have no idea what I've been trying to do
6382420	6383740	to get hired, okay?
6385060	6388660	I just, it's kinda crazy, but I love it.
6388660	6389620	I hope you get on.
6389620	6391320	I actually watched the tester.
6392500	6393860	Might I go so far as to say
6393860	6395420	I enjoyed the last season of the tester.
6395420	6397980	I think they could do a little more with it, but...
6399340	6401780	You might also wanna watch the show.
6401780	6403980	They give you an option for them not to share your shit.
6403980	6404820	That's good.
6404820	6407140	You have an idea what to expect, just saying.
6407140	6412140	Oh, man.
6412780	6414020	I can't wait.
6414020	6415780	I hope Dark Soccer gets on the show.
6415780	6417940	Of course, that means she won't be on OLR for a few weeks
6417940	6420140	while they're taping the show.
6420140	6421940	Party at Jamie's house.
6421940	6424900	Well, yeah, but I'll be famous and you won't.
6426500	6427700	Wow.
6427700	6429300	You'll get booted off first.
6429300	6430440	No, I won't.
6432060	6433540	It doesn't like my password.
6434460	6435820	All right, let's move on.
6435820	6436640	Do we have any more emails
6436640	6437480	or was it the last one?
6437480	6438300	I'll ask you in a second.
6438300	6439140	All right.
6440580	6442100	I'm enhancing my celebrity.
6442100	6444580	You have all week to try out for that stinking show.
6444580	6446160	Okay.
6446160	6449100	Hey, OLR, it's SonicM88 here.
6449100	6451060	I've been intermittently listening to the podcast
6451060	6452580	and live show for a few years,
6452580	6455060	so you probably don't recognize the name.
6455060	6456300	We don't recognize a lot of you people.
6456300	6457740	I mean, hi.
6457740	6458580	I'm kidding, kitty.
6458580	6460100	I heard that name in chat earlier tonight, so welcome.
6460100	6461900	Anyway, I picked up a 3DS this week
6461900	6463160	so I can get the retro games
6463160	6465640	and also the money back from the price drop.
6465640	6467380	As Loki predicted, GameStop has decided
6467380	6469360	not to honor the price guarantee thing,
6469360	6470780	which does not surprise me at all.
6470780	6472640	In fact, I'm not even sure I'll be able
6472640	6475860	to get the AD back from where I purchased it.
6475860	6477260	I bought it at Best Buy
6477260	6478760	and they didn't know about the price drop
6478760	6481060	or didn't say anything about not honoring their policy
6481060	6483220	when I bought it, but I have this feeling
6483220	6484060	that it won't work.
6484060	6486360	Either way, in my mind, it's totally worth it
6486360	6488560	just for the GBA titles alone.
6488560	6490900	I really miss the Game Boy as a platform.
6490900	6493580	I never really got into the DS like I did with the Game Boy
6493580	6496420	and ended up selling the one I had three years ago.
6496420	6499580	So I've been out of the DS world for three years.
6499580	6500860	That's where you come in.
6500860	6504460	I'd like to keep my DS for more than just retro GBA titles
6504460	6505980	I bought it for, so I would like to hear
6505980	6508980	some of your favorite DS games that might suit my interests.
6508980	6511380	What do you recommend as games that appeal to everyone
6511380	6514140	and what specific titles would interest someone like me?
6514140	6515860	I'm not a fan of RPGs anymore.
6515860	6517140	Oh, hang up, no, I'm kidding.
6517140	6519180	Since I don't have the time to play them,
6519180	6521400	I'm more into shooters, arcade games, and platformers.
6521400	6522740	I plan on getting Geometry Wars,
6522740	6524300	Galaxies, a Castlevania title.
6524300	6525340	Which one is best?
6525340	6526460	Oh, what was that one?
6526460	6528180	Order of Ecclesia was really good.
6530100	6531820	Retro Game Challenge, Wire Your Wear Touch,
6531820	6533140	Trauma Center 2.
6533140	6534900	I picked a book arena of time, obviously,
6534900	6537260	and Plants vs. Zombies download version so far.
6537260	6539340	Oh, and Mario Kart DS is my favorite DS game
6539340	6540860	from when I owned one before.
6541980	6544920	I got Puyo Pop, I mean Puyo Puyo.
6544920	6547220	I've got Otsutatakayo Endan,
6547220	6548500	or you could get Elite Beat Agents.
6548500	6550540	I actually really prefer the Japanese one.
6550540	6553500	Um, what else is in my thing?
6553500	6557300	Oh yeah, what was that Professor Hatsworth game?
6557300	6558320	Professor Layton?
6558320	6559800	No, it was Hatsworth.
6561280	6563340	It's like a combination puzzle game
6563340	6565740	and investigation game.
6565740	6566780	It's really interesting.
6566780	6568220	Yeah, I kinda know what you're talking about, yeah.
6568220	6570300	That game was pretty fun.
6570300	6572140	I don't know, what else, Rob?
6572140	6573420	He named a lot of them.
6573420	6576120	I mean, gosh, you got a whole full plate there.
6576120	6577580	Retro Game Challenge was one of the ones
6577580	6578820	that came to my mind too.
6578820	6583820	Um, oh, really good games on DS.
6586040	6587740	I need more time to think.
6587740	6589460	Actually, I should just go grab my DS case
6589460	6590300	and see what's in it.
6590300	6591140	I know, right?
6591140	6592460	Like, I'm like, I can't see my DS collection
6592460	6593460	right in front of me.
6595020	6596940	A lot of people are really into the Pokemon games.
6596940	6598380	I play a lot of Cookie Mama.
6599420	6601580	Since he's talking about Trauma Center,
6601580	6603900	Cookie Mama's like that with food.
6603900	6607300	So it's really fun, and don't worry, Mama will fix it.
6607300	6609260	I liked the game, the Kirby game,
6609260	6610940	where you draw the lines.
6610940	6612120	Oh, um.
6613140	6613980	Kirby's.
6613980	6614820	Epic Yarn.
6614820	6616440	No, no, that was the Wii game.
6617500	6618680	It was a different Kirby game
6618680	6620420	where you would draw all the lines and stuff.
6620420	6622200	I don't remember.
6622200	6623660	Making me think.
6623660	6625140	Am I a talk show host?
6626340	6628700	Some of the old school, like even the Mario 64 port's
6628700	6630220	actually really good too.
6630220	6632620	Oh, Elite Beat Agents, says Dungeon Busters and Chat.
6632620	6634540	Well, I said that, it says it Oendon,
6634540	6636500	but I said you can get it as Elite Beat Agents,
6636500	6637740	although I prefer Oendon.
6641140	6642900	Oh, there's Ragnarok.
6642900	6644660	And that's RPG though.
6644660	6646180	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6646180	6647020	I liked it though.
6647020	6648620	Break Man says Civilization Revolution.
6648620	6649960	I really liked that game.
6649960	6652460	But I liked it on the consoles.
6652460	6653300	I don't know how well it pointed over to DS.
6653300	6655660	I should get my DS case and look.
6655660	6658380	Then again, I've got like a box of games, so.
6659300	6661980	I'll lend you one, maybe.
6661980	6664040	I'll sell you some of them.
6664040	6665100	I might not be listening live
6665100	6666340	because of work early in the morning.
6666340	6667260	I'm on the East Coast.
6667260	6669340	So if the chat has any good recommendations too,
6669340	6670860	I would love to hear those in the podcast,
6670860	6672100	which we just did.
6672100	6673860	Oh, he said he's not into RPGs,
6673860	6677100	but the Final Fantasy IV remake is so fucking good.
6677100	6679120	Like, you might want to think about
6679120	6680560	going back to RPGs for that.
6682080	6683660	Keep up the great work with the podcast.
6683660	6685420	It's still my favorite out there by a long shot.
6685420	6686740	Thanks guys, SonicM88.
6686740	6689220	Oh, and by the way, I am playing Final Fantasy III,
6689220	6691540	and it's pretty good on the game.
6691540	6692500	See, there you go.
6694340	6695300	Oh, great.
6695300	6698300	My profile's made.
6698300	6699700	Oh, I love what Zethur says here.
6699700	6701760	Meteos is awesome.
6701760	6703220	Meteos was an amazing DS game.
6703220	6704640	Electroplankton was kind of fun.
6704640	6706200	That was a great DS game.
6707480	6708860	All right, is that it for emails?
6708860	6711020	Yeah, and by the way, I've got a profile now.
6711020	6713780	Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.
6713780	6715680	I ain't got a picture, but I'll link it in the chat room.
6715680	6716860	Are you gonna, you should put a picture.
6716860	6718060	You need to start filling it out
6718060	6720220	with why you need to be on the tester.
6720220	6721300	I will, but I'm linking it already.
6721300	6722420	I need a job.
6722420	6726260	You have to talk about how much you love Sony
6726260	6729020	and how you've been a gaming girl all your life
6729020	6730140	and dah, dah, dah.
6730140	6731940	I bet you'll get on.
6731940	6732800	I bet you will.
6734980	6736820	All right, anyhow, moving on.
6736820	6738300	We got some more news stories for you guys.
6738300	6739700	Oh, we got the FUs of the Week.
6739700	6740640	We gotta do those.
6740640	6745640	As much fun as I would like to join the tester,
6745640	6749980	I would hate to have to move to LA to be a game tester.
6749980	6751820	Yeah, you do know you have to move to Santa Monica
6751820	6754580	to be a game, to do the production, right?
6754580	6755420	She doesn't care.
6755420	6756260	I don't care.
6756260	6757080	All right.
6757080	6757920	I'll commute.
6757920	6758760	She'll be closer to Disneyland.
6758760	6760780	We'll be closer to Disneyland.
6760780	6762220	But see, the problem is though,
6762220	6765460	it's a judging panel that decides whether,
6765460	6766440	or is it challenges?
6766440	6767280	I don't know.
6767280	6768740	I've never watched a show.
6768740	6771580	It's weird challenges that sometimes have nothing
6771580	6772420	to do with games.
6772420	6773820	Yeah, it's like we challenge you to like,
6773820	6776660	it's not like, see, cause when I first heard
6776660	6778740	about the tester, I was thinking it's that
6778740	6783740	there was a show that was on like sci-fi or spike
6784420	6785260	or something like that.
6785260	6787600	It was where they were actually playing games
6787600	6790940	and they had game related challenges and stuff like that.
6790940	6794860	But this is something stupid.
6794860	6795880	Okay, here's what I said.
6795880	6796720	I'd be an asshole.
6796720	6798900	I own more than 40 different video game systems
6798900	6800300	and have decades of experience.
6800300	6802460	I'm also a graphic designer with a focus on video games
6802460	6804420	and an experience in 3D design in Maya.
6804420	6805480	I could use a job.
6805480	6809480	How's that sound?
6809480	6811680	You should give a shout out to the podcast too.
6811680	6812680	Just for when you,
6815920	6816920	just for, you know.
6819280	6822620	When I am on, I'll do it in my video.
6823800	6825300	Oh my God, I gotta do a video.
6826520	6827640	I better be super cute.
6827640	6829040	Better get your hair did.
6829040	6831640	I need to get my hair did, my nails did.
6831640	6833880	They're still naming DS games in the chat.
6833880	6835600	Zether says Contra 4.
6835600	6836440	That was pretty good.
6836440	6837600	That was pretty good.
6837600	6839060	Break Man in chat says,
6839060	6840400	Loki couldn't do the tester
6840400	6842080	because Loki doesn't take orders.
6842080	6843560	Loki gives orders.
6843560	6844400	Mwahaha.
6845440	6846280	There you go.
6846280	6848760	What are you, what are you looking at there?
6848760	6850640	Are you like doing a tiny tower cheat?
6850640	6851880	Is that what's happening?
6853000	6856240	Did you cheat and you have 6 million gold in tiny tower
6856240	6857080	you damn cheater?
6857080	6858120	What the crap?
6858120	6858960	I am a cheater.
6858960	6860240	You are a damn dirty cheater.
6860240	6861080	How did you do it?
6861080	6861900	No, I'm not cheating.
6861900	6862740	I don't wanna know.
6862740	6863580	I have a jailbroken device.
6863580	6865080	I can do whatever the fuck I want.
6865080	6867880	And it's completely legal.
6867880	6871100	You're a lying, cheating sack of shit.
6871100	6871940	That's why.
6871940	6873000	My tiny tower ain't gonna be tiny no more.
6873000	6875920	That's why you're not gonna be a fucking game tester.
6877500	6879000	Cause you can't play by the rules.
6879000	6879840	Bullshit.
6879840	6880840	I could be an awesome tester.
6880840	6881680	You know what?
6881680	6883240	In fact, there was a thing that I saw.
6883240	6884880	My picture and it's cute.
6884880	6885720	Listen, there you go.
6885720	6887360	There's a, I mean, shit.
6887360	6889960	I've played so much Grand Theft Auto.
6889960	6891120	I could easily be a tester
6891120	6892880	for their goddamn multiplayer stuff.
6892880	6894520	I know the ins and outs of all
6894520	6897440	of their Grand Theft Auto games, including the PSP.
6897440	6900360	I know shit that they probably don't even know.
6900360	6902120	But then again, I don't want to compete
6902120	6904400	on a show where I have to compare images
6904400	6905760	to see what's different.
6905760	6908080	If I wanted to do that, I'd buy a DS.
6911800	6912680	All right.
6912680	6915040	Break Man says, when you apply for the job, Dark Soccer,
6915040	6917080	just tell them you know the Bobby Black Wolf.
6917080	6918260	You'll be hired on right away.
6918260	6919100	That's true.
6919100	6921560	After all, he is a trending topic in Sacramento this evening.
6921560	6924520	Yep.
6924520	6925280	All right.
6925280	6926800	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
6943280	6948880	My FU of the week goes to me not having a copy of Black Matrix.
6948880	6950040	I found it on eBay.
6950040	6951240	No one will buy it for me.
6951240	6953480	Boo hoo.
6953480	6956840	My FU of the week goes to Loki for cheating on a tiny tower.
6956840	6962720	And I hope his tower, because it's so cheaply made,
6962720	6965320	I hope that the material that his tiny tower was made out
6965320	6966880	of just collapses on itself.
6966880	6969040	And the whole building just implodes on itself.
6969040	6971000	He'll have the blood of his bitizens on his hands.
6971000	6971640	Exactly.
6971640	6975320	And you'll have the blood of all those bitizens on your hands.
6975320	6978160	Otherwise, I give an FU to tacos for being so delicious
6978160	6980120	and making me fat.
6980120	6982400	Loki.
6982400	6986520	I guess my FU would go to the tester.
6986520	6992080	Because if I were to win the tester,
6992080	6993760	I'd end up working at Sony.
6993760	6997320	And I'd look at the sheet of things that they want me to test.
6997320	6997880	I'm sorry.
6997880	6999600	I don't see that this, you know, I'm
6999600	7003480	supposed to test to see if this game doesn't suck.
7003480	7004360	I don't know.
7004360	7005200	I got nothing.
7005200	7008280	I'm not really mad at anything.
7008280	7013240	It was surprisingly easy to do with the jailbroken device,
7013240	7015400	I might add.
7015400	7017720	Download a file, copy it over, done.
7017720	7019280	And it didn't even erase my progress.
7019280	7021120	It just added 6 million money.
7021120	7024840	All right, so I see that DarkSakura has a profile.
7024840	7025960	Like, how do I vote for you?
7025960	7028200	Oh, there's a big clock in the corner.
7028200	7030360	Voting begins in 16 days.
7030360	7034360	Like, I can't actually vote for you yet, I guess.
7034360	7036400	Like, I would make a profile and endorse you.
7036400	7039240	But then doesn't that put me in the pool to try out for the show?
7039240	7039960	No.
7039960	7041720	You pick whether you're going to be a voter
7041720	7042520	or you're going to be a candidate.
7042520	7043040	Oh, OK.
7043040	7044280	OK, then I'll sign up later.
7044280	7045560	And I'll vote for you.
7045560	7048320	But can I get the URL out to everybody so they can vote for you?
7048320	7050160	I linked it in the chat room, so go for it.
7050160	7055600	H-T-T-P-S, secure website, colon slash slash casting dot
7055600	7059840	the tester dot com slash DarkSakura.
7059840	7060440	There you go.
7060440	7062940	I've added a second picture of what my hair looks like curly.
7062940	7065440	You know, it just occurred to me.
7065440	7068640	Derek H., I think on Dead Pixel Live last year,
7068640	7071960	had the casting dude for the tester on his show.
7071960	7075200	You need to talk to Derek and get dude's email address
7075200	7077360	and just be like, yo, cast me.
7077360	7078520	That's what you need to do.
7078520	7081760	You need to just bypass this whole system right here.
7081760	7087360	You need to go directly to show, do not pass go.
7087360	7088920	We should all be on the tester.
7088920	7090200	No, we're not all going on.
7090200	7091920	I'm not going on that goddamn show.
7091920	7093320	Come on, it'd be hilarious.
7093320	7095480	If I go on the show, it is to be a judge,
7095480	7097760	because I would enjoy nothing more than the judge, the two
7097760	7100120	of you sitting up there getting ready for elimination.
7100120	7103600	I think that guy doesn't know shit about testing games.
7103600	7107800	He wasn't even a trending topic in Sacramento.
7107800	7110440	Well, Loki, you're a goddamn cheater at all your video games.
7110440	7112080	Explain why you should be on the tester.
7112080	7115320	Because I know where to find the information
7115320	7116320	that you're looking for.
7116320	7120640	I know to find all the exploits and back doors for your games
7120640	7122680	and how to get around this stuff.
7122680	7125600	If you don't fix this shit, other people are going to do it.
7125600	7127800	DarkSakura, your Kinect is still in a box.
7127800	7130000	Why should you be the tester?
7130000	7131680	Because my Kinect's in the box.
7131680	7134080	My move is fucking on the TV.
7134080	7138160	That is why I need to be a fucking tester.
7138160	7140560	Because we have a goddamn Gran Turismo setup
7140560	7144160	built in our house, where we can play in a fucking race car.
7144160	7145400	Is your name DarkSakura?
7145400	7146000	That's funny.
7146000	7147840	You don't sound like DarkSakura.
7147840	7150840	I can say, well, because we have a $400 rig set up
7150840	7157280	to play Gran Turismo 5, and that we've built seats
7157280	7161280	to play this set up out of the seats from a Honda Prelude,
7161280	7162760	two of them.
7162760	7165880	I have every Sony system ever made.
7165880	7167920	OK, here.
7167920	7170040	This is fine radio and all, but there's
7170040	7172560	a part of me that is legit worried you're actually
7172560	7174720	going to get on this show.
7174720	7176160	I have legitimate concerns.
7176160	7178520	If I get a job out of this, fuck yeah.
7178520	7180920	But this could also end up very bad.
7180920	7182920	You could end up being the bitch.
7182920	7187200	I've seen you go without eating for some time.
7187200	7189640	It is not going to be pretty if you have to do something.
7189640	7191280	Yes, Rob knows what low blood sugar Jamie is like.
7191280	7192680	And you might have to do something
7192680	7194240	that you don't like on this program.
7194240	7195200	And I am very worried.
7195200	7196080	I should sign up too.
7196080	7197200	You'll be hilarious.
7197200	7197760	Like what?
7197760	7200320	Play Imagine Babies?
7200320	7203680	OK, one last season they had some fucking challenge
7203680	7205640	where they were out there doing army stuff.
7205640	7206960	And OK, I know.
7206960	7208400	I know it'll piss you off.
7208400	7211920	Working together as a team with people who are idiots.
7211920	7214040	That is going to piss you off beyond belief.
7214040	7215640	See, you're already fretting.
7215640	7217360	No, I will tell you this.
7217360	7222160	Because I worked with idiots at my job and I hit it very well.
7222160	7226160	I know how to be a team fucking player.
7226160	7227160	I am good.
7227160	7229680	Can you teach Loki a thing or two?
7229680	7230200	No.
7230200	7232160	I am my own team.
7232160	7235760	No, because his team is the voices in his head.
7235760	7241440	I can take a picture of the vault and show it to them.
7241440	7243560	This is why you need to have me because I've
7243560	7244400	played all this shit.
7244400	7246520	Legitimate concern that you actually
7246520	7248760	may make a case for yourself to be on this show
7248760	7251040	and you will actually be on this program.
7251040	7252240	Look at this face.
7252240	7253440	Look at this adorable face.
7253440	7254840	I try not to.
7254840	7255520	Shut up.
7255520	7256520	I gave you ice cream.
7256520	7257680	Look at me.
7257680	7258240	I'm looking.
7258240	7259440	I'm looking.
7259440	7261160	I'm serious.
7261160	7262480	I am for real serious.
7262480	7264720	I want to be on the tester.
7264720	7266560	You do realize this is for a minimum wage
7266560	7268200	job in Santa Monica, right?
7268200	7269280	It could be.
7269280	7272320	But note that the Annie's up this season.
7272320	7274040	It's a production job this year.
7274040	7275200	Which means that I would be.
7275200	7276000	A production job.
7276000	7276840	So what's that mean?
7276840	7277840	I'll put it this way.
7277840	7281600	Production is like, OK, like for a graphic designer,
7281600	7287320	production would be like color editing, color correction,
7287320	7290480	you know, adjusting textures, that type of thing.
7290480	7291920	Here's a bunch of spindles of disks.
7291920	7292920	Here's a bunch of cases.
7292920	7295240	We need you to produce the finished product.
7295240	7297280	No, that's not how it works.
7297280	7300480	Anyone that's in production is in like the actual building
7300480	7302400	part of the game, like you may be crunching numbers
7302400	7303960	or doing some data entry.
7303960	7305920	You know, it would be something that's
7305920	7309080	the equivalent of the job that I was just fucking doing.
7309080	7311440	Except I actually have skills to bring to the table.
7311440	7313760	They could put me to work in art production.
7313760	7314520	And guess what?
7314520	7315560	I would be good at it.
7315560	7318840	Because that's what I'm trying to do with my life.
7318840	7320320	You know what?
7320320	7321560	If I sign up for the tester.
7321560	7322160	What?
7322160	7325200	I'm going to do it in my costume.
7325200	7327600	Why are you people trying out for the tester?
7327600	7329560	You used to make fun of this show two years ago.
7329560	7330120	That's the whole point.
7330120	7331080	Don't you understand?
7331080	7332800	I need a job.
7332800	7333800	Don't you understand?
7333800	7334800	That's the whole point.
7334800	7336360	That's the funniest part about it.
7336360	7338800	What better way to get back at something
7338800	7341080	that you hate than to be part of it
7341080	7343880	and then be a complete asshole on it.
7343880	7344960	It would be awesome.
7344960	7346200	Rob, for real though.
7346200	7347400	I don't want to win.
7347400	7350440	I just want to be on the show.
7350440	7352720	And see, I want a job.
7352720	7353680	Thank you, Frisbee.
7353680	7357000	I want to be the very best that no one ever was.
7357000	7358160	I want a job.
7358160	7361320	Hey, any of you people listening to the show, I'm talented.
7361320	7362920	Hire me.
7362920	7366840	Because honestly though, because I was thinking about it,
7366840	7370120	I would, if the job equivalency is what I'm thinking of,
7370120	7372200	I would be making about what I made at my old job.
7372200	7375480	Will you be able to tighten up the graphics on level three?
7375480	7376200	I could try.
7376200	7376680	OK.
7376680	7377200	No.
7377200	7377720	Hold on, hold on.
7377720	7379920	I want to just show dark soccer this real quick here.
7379920	7381600	Dark soccer, I just want to show you this.
7381600	7383720	11 elite gamers squared off to see
7383720	7386680	who had what it takes to be an official PlayStation game
7386680	7387200	tester.
7387200	7389160	Oh, no.
7389160	7391480	Cyrus, you've won.
7391480	7394360	Now it's time to usher in a new generation.
7394360	7397880	Welcome to the tester season two.
7397880	7399920	And this time, even you got to.
7399920	7401440	I mean, look at all those douchebags.
7401440	7403600	You really are going to have to team play with them.
7403600	7405080	You do know that, right?
7405080	7410560	Well, you see, as Rob, as one of superior intellect,
7410560	7413000	I would actually manipulate them into failure.
7413000	7414520	Pick one of the contestants.
7414520	7417000	Congratulations, 8-Bit Mickey.
7417000	7418840	These 12 gamers will be living together
7418840	7419840	in PlayStation Paradise.
7419840	7421600	Well, if that guy got voted in, you will, too.
7421600	7424360	I am one with the video games.
7424360	7426760	I want to hurt him so bad.
7426760	7430400	I'm going to dance with the tester to be the next PlayStation
7430400	7431400	game tester.
7431400	7433440	They had to do a dancing competition.
7433440	7435760	Are you going to do a dancing competition, Darzana?
7435760	7437960	I got rhythm.
7437960	7439280	I'll do a Para Para.
7439280	7443280	She didn't even miss a beat in saying that, I got rhythm.
7443280	7444080	Have you seen?
7444080	7446560	Now, this is hilarious, because Joystick
7446560	7450040	decided that they made casting videos for each one
7450040	7451400	of the people on their staff.
7451400	7452360	Nice.
7452360	7452920	Well played.
7452920	7454320	They have some really funny ones.
7454320	7455280	Well played.
7455280	7458720	No, seriously, Rob, I'll do Para Para.
7458720	7460800	It's fine.
7460800	7461960	I hope you get the job.
7461960	7463680	I legit hope you get the job.
7463680	7467440	Well, bring the video camera and show off my Baymani
7467440	7471160	and all this other quality PlayStation shit I have.
7471160	7473480	I mean, quality PlayStation products
7473480	7476160	that I've spent my good, hard-earned money on
7476160	7479080	and my first-generation PlayStation 3,
7479080	7481520	so I can say, look, Linux.
7481520	7485320	I mean, look, it plays PS1 games.
7485320	7487720	Zether is linking me to a YouTube saying,
7487720	7489320	this was a tester contestant.
7489320	7490600	I can't wait to see this here.
7490600	7491120	Let's see.
7491120	7493120	Watch out, they're coming through the window.
7493120	7495600	Watch out, they're coming through the window.
7495600	7497080	They're coming through the window.
7497080	7498080	Coming through the window.
7498080	7499080	Coming through the window.
7499080	7500560	Oh, I got a hell yeah.
7500560	7503840	Is that Rebecca Black?
7503840	7507600	Sure, yes, it's Rebecca Black, DarkSakura.
7507600	7509680	All grown up.
7509680	7512520	I just want to say, if you go on the show, that's going to be you.
7512520	7514720	Can we get a hey, they're coming through the window?
7514720	7515840	Come on, DarkSakura.
7515840	7518880	Bite my ass.
7518880	7519920	You're not a team player.
7519920	7523800	You lied when you said you were a team player.
7523800	7528720	All right, Loki, let's move on with some actual gaming news.
7528720	7534360	Maroon 5 has decided to join in the lawsuits
7534360	7537600	against Activision over Guitar Hero.
7537600	7539040	In this case, it's Band Hero.
7539040	7542400	He is suing because of Activision
7542400	7545520	improbably uses like this in Band Hero,
7545520	7548200	and you know the drill, OK?
7548200	7550120	He thought he was only singing his song,
7550120	7552160	but then he ended up singing all these songs,
7552160	7556800	and now he doesn't like that because it cheapens him
7556800	7559360	as an artist or some shit.
7559360	7564640	Being a judge on The Voice didn't already do that.
7564640	7570200	Yeah, it was great because he did the motion capture
7570200	7572760	to have his avatar used in the Band Hero song,
7572760	7575600	She Will Be Loved, but didn't give Activision permission
7575600	7578680	to use his likeness with other songs, which it totally did.
7578680	7580280	Déjà vu from like a year ago.
7580280	7582600	Levine alleges Activision asked other artists
7582600	7584120	for expanded use of their avatars
7584120	7585560	and paid them more for the process.
7588840	7591800	Wow, it's last year all over again.
7591800	7593720	Really?
7593720	7595000	Yeah.
7595000	7597640	And of course, the same thing happened with No Doubt.
7597640	7600480	Do you think they just want a piece of the money as well?
7600480	7603120	I guess that's really what it's got to do with, huh?
7603120	7604320	I don't care.
7604320	7605480	I don't even care.
7605480	7607400	I mean, because boo fucking who?
7607400	7608400	Get over it.
7608400	7609400	I mean, seriously.
7609400	7609920	Oh, no.
7609920	7615840	You're in a game singing other people's songs in their voice.
7615840	7617040	It's an avatar.
7617040	7617960	Who cares?
7617960	7620720	No one made you like, no one drugged you up
7620720	7624520	and made you sing those songs on stage for like a live concert
7624520	7625480	or something like that.
7625480	7631520	It's a digital character, not really you.
7631520	7634320	I mean, they don't steal your soul and put it into the game.
7634320	7637680	I mean, unless you may think that's how it works,
7637680	7638960	it's not really you.
7638960	7641320	My art is my soul.
7641320	7644040	And when I sing a Miley Cyrus song in these games,
7644040	7645520	that's raping my art.
7648520	7649560	Well, here's the problem.
7649560	7652000	I did not want to hear anything about Miley Cyrus and rape.
7652000	7654760	You put your songs into Band Hero.
7654760	7659160	Band Hero, which is the poppy version of Guitar Hero.
7659160	7662040	You should have really put your stuff in the Guitar Hero,
7662040	7664920	not Band Hero, or Rock Band.
7664920	7668040	Suck with Rock Band.
7668040	7670360	All right.
7670360	7672600	I don't know what to make of this next story.
7672600	7675040	Let's see what you guys think of it.
7675040	7677320	Let's see.
7677320	7680160	Pete Hines from Bethesda Softworks
7680160	7683120	figured that February 18th would be the perfect day
7683120	7686920	to conceive a child, as the baby would be due on November 11th,
7686920	7692160	which would be the ship date for the Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.
7692160	7693960	There's another couple, though, that
7693960	7696920	has conceived a little bit earlier than that.
7696920	7697440	Let's see.
7697440	7701840	Atari Lin, I guess, is the child,
7701840	7707480	decided to come out of the mom's womb
7707480	7712760	as mom and dad sat down for the half hour demo of the Bethesda
7712760	7716080	Skyrim demo at QuakeCon.
7716080	7718640	The father talked to Game Informer
7718640	7721840	that, I guess, the sight of the Frost Dragon on the screen
7721840	7725640	sent mom into labor.
7725640	7729240	The couple hung around, rather than dashing for the hospital,
7729240	7732160	because they thought it might be false labor.
7732160	7734480	And she loves Skyrim.
7737440	7739560	They named the baby, apparently, Atari Lin.
7743560	7744760	Dorks.
7744760	7747560	You know, they are one letter away from Atari Linx.
7747560	7751000	They made a baby.
7751000	7753400	And they went into labor.
7753400	7755280	But they didn't go to the hospital right away.
7755280	7756880	So the baby drowned at the thing?
7756880	7757400	Yeah.
7757400	7759920	Well, they did want to miss the demo, Dark Soccer.
7759920	7763480	This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see Skyrim.
7763480	7765560	You know, it's not a once in a lifetime opportunity,
7765560	7769320	because you can see the game when it comes out.
7769320	7772800	You know, Dark Soccer, you're not being a team player.
7772800	7773960	I'm not on his team.
7773960	7777120	I'm on the team of smart people.
7777120	7781240	Apparently, Kotaku, who first broke this story, so to speak,
7781240	7783480	was actually contacted by the mother.
7783480	7785920	They're saying that she's actually still in labor
7785920	7787120	and reading the comments.
7787120	7790000	But I guess they are still naming the baby Atari.
7790000	7792400	The name Atari comes from the name Ataru,
7792400	7794200	which means to hit a target.
7794200	7795040	Yeah, they're just.
7795040	7799640	Yeah, that's what they named the baby after is to hit a target.
7799640	7801200	Ataru, hit a target.
7801200	7802920	This baby is going to be a bullet.
7802920	7804040	It's going to hit a target.
7804040	7806560	Not naming it after a game system
7806560	7809680	that these geeks obviously named their kid after.
7809680	7812560	They also do say, we assume by the time she's in high school,
7812560	7814040	most of the children her age are not
7814040	7817000	going to know what an Atari is.
7817000	7818840	No, that's not true.
7818840	7821520	They should know.
7821520	7823600	That's not true.
7823600	7825520	Man, you know, it's just like, can you
7825520	7828080	imagine when the kid wants to know someday, like, you know,
7828080	7829680	tell me the story about how it was before.
7829680	7831520	That is so retarded.
7831520	7833080	I mean, seriously, oh, they're not
7833080	7834600	going to know what an Atari is.
7834600	7835080	Really?
7835080	7838480	Because children don't learn history?
7838480	7842000	Oh my god, what is, you know, the 13 colonies?
7842000	7844960	I don't even know because I wasn't alive then.
7844960	7849920	Well, OK, name five movie stars from the 1940s.
7849920	7852040	Go.
7852040	7853480	I don't fucking watch movies.
7853480	7856360	See, you couldn't do it, so maybe they can't do it.
7856360	7857600	I don't know.
7857600	7862600	Maybe that's the thought behind it.
7862600	7864080	Uh, Fay Wray.
7864080	7866080	All right, let's shoot some of the 30s.
7866080	7866600	Shit.
7866600	7867520	Earn his Borg 9.
7867520	7868040	All right.
7868040	7868680	He's old enough.
7871960	7875160	Moving on, another story about Skyrim real quick.
7875160	7877720	I guess Skyrim, you know, it's going to cost $60,
7877720	7879680	but there hopefully will be like thousands
7879680	7881200	of hours of gameplay in this game
7881200	7882360	that make it worth the $60.
7882360	7883440	300 hours is what they're saying.
7883440	7884960	That's still pretty fucking good.
7884960	7886080	That is a long time.
7886080	7886880	That's a long time.
7886880	7888880	The original Oblivion was 100 hours.
7888880	7892080	So here's the interesting comment, though,
7892080	7894320	from Skyrim director Todd Howard.
7894320	7897480	It's speaking to PSM3, one of the magazines there.
7897480	7900800	I do think industry-wide we would benefit from more games
7900800	7903560	out at $19 or $29.
7903560	7905640	I would try more games because I'm not
7905640	7907400	going to try a game for $60.
7907400	7908920	It's a tough decision.
7908920	7911760	But then they went on to say that, yes, the $60 price
7911760	7913560	point is still what Skyrim's going to be at.
7913560	7916520	So there should be more games at $19 and $29,
7916520	7919160	but Skyrim's still $60, just so you know.
7919160	7919880	I hate to say it.
7919880	7922200	OK, all joking aside, the irony aside,
7922200	7923840	he kind of does have a point, though.
7923840	7926560	If games overall were kind of cheaper,
7926560	7928840	it wouldn't feel like such a loss to try a game at $19
7928840	7929560	or $29.
7929560	7931440	I think the fact of the matter is most games
7931440	7932840	aren't worth $60.
7932840	7936000	300 hours out of a game, I mean, that's
7936000	7937680	unheard of in most cases.
7937680	7942560	If only there were a way to try games before you bought them,
7942560	7948120	we could call it rent team or demos.
7951120	7954880	If only such things existed in modern society,
7954880	7958440	but us being so barbaric, have not
7958440	7962920	had the foresight to create such wonderful implementations
7962920	7966880	of trials.
7966880	7967840	But yes, you're right.
7967840	7970840	We should tell the studios that spend millions of dollars
7970840	7972560	in production to, hey, you know what?
7972560	7973920	You need to put your game out for $2,
7973920	7976240	because no one's really going to buy it unless it's $2.
7979680	7981600	Well, on the iPhone, I mean, a lot of people
7981600	7982600	will buy games at $99.
7982600	7984040	Unless he puts out Skyrim for $19.99,
7984040	7985500	I don't fucking care what he wants.
7985500	7987960	Skyrim will be $19.99 in like three years
7987960	7989560	during the Steam sale.
7989560	7992600	Oblivion was on sale either yesterday or today.
7992600	7994960	Oh my god, it was like the super hello Uber edition
7994960	7996240	for like $10.
7996240	7999040	Like everything, everything that they ever put out
7999040	8003480	for Oblivion for like $10.
8003480	8005600	Anyhow, Dark Sakura, I know you're
8005600	8007560	working on your application, but do you have enough time
8007560	8008680	for another story for us?
8008680	8010240	I sure do.
8010240	8013000	Well, you know they just had the Evo tournament.
8013000	8014560	Well, they're going to have to relearn
8014560	8017160	all their characters all over again, at least for Super
8017160	8019200	Street Fighter 4 arcade edition.
8019200	8022840	Patch is coming out that will rebalance the game.
8022840	8025360	So right now it's really imbalanced,
8025360	8026840	so they're hoping to fix it.
8026840	8031160	It's going to be version 2012.
8031160	8032840	And they did it outside of Evo.
8032840	8036880	Yoshinori Ono actually said that they've been location testing
8036880	8040040	the version in Japan.
8040040	8042200	So there, you don't have to buy it again.
8042200	8044960	You just have to download the patch.
8044960	8047120	Well, that's good that it's just a patch this time,
8047120	8049180	and yet not another way to milk more money out
8049180	8050800	of the same damn game as they've been doing
8050800	8051880	for the past three years.
8051880	8054720	I know right, I know right.
8054720	8055200	That's it.
8055200	8056200	All right.
8056200	8057640	Just a couple more stories for you guys,
8057640	8061080	and we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8061080	8063080	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8063080	8064760	And we'll get to your Twitter topics
8064760	8067080	as well at twitter.com slash O-L-R.
8067080	8068980	But first, a couple last stories for you.
8068980	8069480	Loki?
8072120	8073200	Loki?
8073200	8073680	OK.
8073680	8075560	Sorry.
8075560	8076640	So one last thing.
8076640	8080240	This is kind of interesting.
8080240	8083360	Remember how we talked about Pac-Man and Galaga dimensions
8083360	8085480	last week, and how they were kind of following suit
8085480	8089480	with what Capcom did with Resident Evil?
8089480	8091720	Thankfully, that wasn't the case, actually.
8091720	8094820	Namco Bandai came out and said, actually, there
8094820	8099000	is a way to reset your game saves on our game.
8099000	8101560	And what you do is basically, upon startup,
8101560	8105200	players can input the command ABXYLR,
8105200	8108600	and it will wipe the save data from the cartridge.
8108600	8112560	How they should have done it on all the games.
8112560	8115840	Resident Evil Capcom.
8115840	8118240	But yeah.
8118240	8121080	So there was a secret code the whole time just hiding out
8121080	8122080	there behind the couch.
8122080	8122580	Who knew?
8122580	8124720	Yeah, unfortunately, that's not the case with Capcom's.
8124720	8126160	Do you think that might be one of those things
8126160	8128240	that they kind of announced it now just to kind of like cover
8128240	8128880	their ass?
8128880	8131760	Yeah, that's exactly why they did it.
8131760	8132480	Interesting.
8132480	8134600	Because everyone's like, phew, OK.
8134600	8138280	Maybe I will buy the game.
8138280	8141040	That's interesting, though, that there was kind of like,
8141040	8143360	this feature probably existed for the purposes
8143360	8144920	of like testing the game.
8144920	8146080	Dark Soccer, you might want to listen up,
8146080	8147200	because this could be your future career.
8147200	8148040	I am listening.
8148040	8152840	This could be something that was there for the testers
8152840	8153840	to use that they did.
8153840	8155920	Because sometimes that's where a lot of these codes
8155920	8158960	come from is like the play testing of the game, right?
8158960	8159880	Like a lot of those.
8159880	8160680	Like the Contra code.
8160680	8164480	Yeah, all that stuff came from like play testing and so forth.
8164480	8166840	So sometimes those codes kind of get out.
8166840	8171920	Maybe, just maybe, could one actually exist in the Capcom game?
8171920	8173520	I'm sure.
8173520	8176280	So maybe there's an A-B-X-Y-L-R type of thing
8176280	8179280	that maybe will save the day for Capcom, too?
8179280	8180960	Could possibly be, who knows?
8180960	8182720	Probably don't hold your breath, though, right?
8182720	8185760	Yeah, or else like you'd need like a dev system or something.
8185760	8187160	I don't know.
8187160	8189000	And I'm noticing this comment from our chat room.
8189000	8191600	RDGSinge says, so are they backpedaling?
8191600	8194280	Do you consider this backpedaling, Loki?
8194280	8198680	No, because I don't really think they, I mean,
8198680	8200080	OK, maybe a little bit.
8200080	8202160	Just because they did say, well, the whole purpose
8202160	8202920	was to do that.
8202920	8205320	What they should have said, yeah, well, you know,
8205320	8208080	we originally wanted it to be that this
8208080	8210160	is kind of an arcade experience, and that's
8210160	8211640	why you don't have this.
8211640	8214840	But if you really do want to erase your save,
8214840	8216760	then here's how you go about and do it.
8216760	8220400	That would have been the proper response.
8220400	8222680	But instead, they said like, they
8222680	8224360	sent out something cryptic that looked
8224360	8228320	like trying to like crack a code from that horrible Nicolas
8228320	8229520	Cage movie or something.
8229520	8231320	Like, it's just like, what the hell is this?
8231320	8233320	Who's drunk at Namco right now?
8233320	8234840	But you know what, though?
8234840	8237320	In the end, all that matters is the end response,
8237320	8241320	and their game has a code, Capcom's doesn't.
8241320	8244520	So guess which one will be most likely purchased?
8244520	8245960	True enough.
8245960	8247600	I was on the fence about this game,
8247600	8251040	and now I'm back in the maybe I will buy it column.
8251040	8252960	Anyhow, one other story for you guys,
8252960	8254840	and I know some of you are looking forward to this game.
8254840	8257120	It's not a game I play a lot of, but I know a lot of you
8257120	8259080	play it, Modern Warfare 3.
8259080	8260980	Yeah, Modern Warfare 3 is coming out.
8260980	8262360	And I remember we were talking earlier
8262360	8264720	in the show about Activision Blizzard had a conference call.
8264720	8267200	Well, something they confirmed about Modern Warfare 3.
8267200	8269440	I know it's going to make some of you guys very happy,
8269440	8270720	some of you holdouts.
8270720	8273080	It's going to be available on the Wii.
8273080	8273760	That's right.
8273760	8277440	Check out that cutting edge graphics and technology
8277440	8278980	on the Wii.
8278980	8281960	Modern Warfare 3 is going to be available on the Wii
8281960	8285820	this holiday, apparently on November 8th,
8285820	8288020	right when all the other versions of the game come out.
8288020	8290480	And it's being made by Treyarch, of course,
8290480	8293980	who also made World of War, and Black Ops, and Call of Duty 3,
8293980	8294920	and so forth.
8294920	8296760	Yes, they are doing the Wii port as well,
8296760	8300640	since they have the experience working with that platform.
8300640	8304000	They did do Spider-Man, Web of Shadows.
8304000	8304760	So there you go.
8304760	8307000	I'm sure tons of you are pre-ordering your copy.
8307000	8310040	I'm sure that will be the way to play the game is on the Wii.
8310040	8311800	Am I right?
8311800	8316440	Modern Warfare 3 will be able to play online.
8316440	8317440	Wait, no.
8317440	8318920	You'll be able to play in HD.
8318920	8320280	Wait, no.
8320280	8321760	You'll be able to have the patch it.
8321760	8323400	Wait, no.
8323400	8324920	Well, somebody I'm sure out there
8324920	8328520	will benefit from Modern Warfare 3 being out there on the Wii.
8328520	8333040	Or as Zethur in the chat room is calling it, Modern Wii Fair.
8333040	8334040	I like that name for it.
8334040	8335400	It makes it sound cute.
8335400	8338240	Modern Wii Fair.
8338240	8342160	That sounds kind of like a personal problem.
8342160	8343240	Never mind.
8343240	8346960	All right, let's go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8346960	8349200	Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8349200	8351920	The Skype line is open right now.
8351920	8353320	But while we wait for some calls,
8353320	8357720	let's do some Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O-L-R.
8357720	8360040	I want to start from this one from TigerClaw305,
8360040	8362340	because it's news that we forgot to mention.
8362340	8363760	And I think it's kind of important.
8363760	8366600	Metroid turned 25 this week.
8366600	8369080	All the old NES games are turning 25, right?
8369080	8370240	Mario turned 25.
8370240	8372240	I think Zelda's 25 pretty soon.
8372240	8374880	Metroid as well, or Zelda did turn 25.
8374880	8376560	That was part of what they did at E3.
8376560	8379280	Metroid just turned 25 this past week.
8379280	8380520	Yay.
8380520	8384440	In related news, you're old.
8384440	8387200	Because I'm sure many of you have played Metroid in the past.
8387200	8388920	And that's now a 25-year-old game.
8388920	8390560	Dark Soccer, how does that make you feel
8390560	8393400	that Metroid is a 25-year-old game?
8393400	8396200	Perky.
8396200	8399120	Perky and full of ice cream.
8399120	8401320	Moving on to other tweets while we wait for some calls.
8401320	8403040	Again, the Skype line is open right now.
8403040	8405680	1877 to Game O-L-R, or as your name on Skype
8405680	8406680	is Orange Launch Radio.
8406680	8408400	Of course, right as I say that, we get some calls.
8408400	8409320	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8409320	8410160	Who's this?
8410160	8411480	It's the one and only Ranma.
8411480	8413640	Hey, one and only Ranma, what's up?
8413640	8415320	Not too much.
8415320	8418280	I have a, not a question, but something
8418280	8420400	I want to discuss from a podcast a couple of weeks
8420400	8422400	ago, if we can rewind back just a bit.
8422400	8424360	I guess.
8424360	8426720	Well, I wanted to talk about it last week,
8426720	8428760	but it would have been too much for me to cover.
8428760	8430360	So you know, I have to spread it out.
8430360	8431520	Mm-hmm.
8431520	8432160	Yeah.
8432160	8434800	So if you remember, a couple of weeks ago,
8434800	8439320	you posted on your profile an article about sports games.
8439320	8440560	Yes.
8440560	8442080	Now, I was thinking about that.
8442080	8443960	And it's like how the person said
8443960	8448000	that you could say Mario Kart is also a sports game.
8448000	8449640	OK, I do remember this.
8449640	8451320	Wasn't it the whole article about don't
8451320	8454000	be so harsh on sports games because sometimes they're
8454000	8456400	kind of leading the way for other series of games?
8456400	8457120	I remember this.
8457120	8458080	OK.
8458080	8459480	Yeah, pretty much.
8459480	8462840	And I was thinking, well, I guess in my opinion,
8462840	8467520	you can't say that Mario Kart is a sports game.
8467520	8472680	That's like saying WWE is actual legitimate wrestling.
8472680	8474080	But to some it is.
8474080	8476240	I mean, couldn't Mario, isn't Mario Kart something
8476240	8479440	you might see on The Oat Show?
8479440	8482520	ESPN 8?
8482520	8486120	Have you ever looked at ESPN 3?
8486120	8488680	Some of that shit isn't sports either.
8488680	8490040	True, true.
8490040	8493560	But it's like most of the sports games,
8493560	8495760	you have to have a bit of a learning curve.
8495760	8498120	You have to study the manual so you
8498120	8500720	know what you're doing with all the buttons, whereas with games
8500720	8504120	like Mario Kart and any of the Mario titles,
8504120	8505960	you just pick up the game and start playing.
8505960	8508480	You don't have to learn any strategies or tactics
8508480	8509360	or anything like that.
8509360	8512240	It's like a pick up and play.
8512240	8515000	I mean, I do understand that it can be considered a sports
8515000	8518000	title, but on the same token, it's not because it's just
8518000	8519720	a fun game to pick up and play.
8519720	8522880	I mean, a lot of sports games you can pick up and play too,
8522880	8524320	especially the old school ones.
8524320	8525840	OK, what's the goal of basketball?
8525840	8526880	Throw ball in net?
8526880	8527960	All right, I can do that.
8527960	8528440	Let's go.
8528440	8530440	Of course, of course.
8530440	8531680	Look at Tecmo Bowl.
8531680	8534400	I mean, yeah, that was a sports game, but on the same token,
8534400	8534880	it wasn't.
8534880	8537840	All you had to do was push in the command for your play,
8537840	8539880	hit the button, and that was it.
8539880	8542600	It was amazing and awesome.
8542600	8546200	Yes, yes, it was.
8546200	8549000	So you just called in a bitch about how Mario Kart Wii is not
8549000	8550400	a sport.
8550400	8553160	More or less, but I understand where the person's coming from,
8553160	8554960	but I guess from the way I look at it,
8554960	8558560	it's not really a sports title, even though it
8558560	8561760	can be considered that, but I'm just saying that's my opinion.
8561760	8563640	Fine, it's not a sports title.
8563640	8565400	Now what?
8565400	8567560	It's a family fun game.
8567560	8570640	That's what you call it, you know?
8570640	8575000	I'm just saying, whereas most of the sports games that EA puts
8575000	8578560	out, you have to learn the insides and outs of it
8578560	8582920	to play it really well, whereas there are other games that
8582920	8584760	are sports games, but you don't need
8584760	8587280	to learn the insides and outs.
8587280	8589360	You just need to know what the buttons do and just
8589360	8592400	start playing, and that's it.
8592400	8595000	All right, fair enough.
8595000	8596440	Anything else on your mind?
8596440	8598240	Yeah, you should try out for the test or two.
8598240	8599880	I'm not trying out for the test or two.
8599880	8600840	You could be Rob.
8600840	8602400	I'm fucking fabulous, bitches.
8602400	8602960	Roberts.
8602960	8604560	A gay guy won last season.
8604560	8606720	They're not going to win two seasons in a row.
8606720	8608120	Hey, it could happen.
8608120	8609480	I may start a revolution.
8609480	8611640	Come on, now.
8611640	8613040	No, it's not.
8613040	8616400	You can win it and just walk up and win it two snaps up
8616400	8617960	in a b-money formation.
8617960	8619400	It's time for a girl to win.
8619400	8621200	But won't you vote for me?
8624000	8625000	You made her cry.
8625000	8625600	Way to go.
8625600	8626520	That's on you, buddy.
8626520	8628400	You're not a team player.
8628400	8629320	Look, hold it.
8629320	8629840	Back it up.
8629840	8631280	Back it up here.
8631280	8636360	Just so you know, I always have the back of Jamie, Loki,
8636360	8637080	and Rob, always.
8637080	8639200	But no matter what, I always vote for Jamie
8639200	8641320	because Jamie's the number one.
8641320	8642280	Simple as that.
8642280	8644200	I always got Ucchan's back, no matter what.
8644200	8644680	Oh, I see.
8644680	8646080	Now, oh, I see.
8646080	8649640	Now we've ranked the OLR hosts from most desirable
8649640	8650480	to least desirable.
8650480	8653080	Well, I am the cutest.
8653080	8654200	No, I'm the cutest.
8654200	8657640	And she put up with me for a weekend.
8657640	8659520	I mean, that alone deserves a trophy.
8659520	8662440	And I've got the best rack of anyone in this room.
8662440	8664120	Well, no, maybe Loki's is better.
8664120	8667280	Rama, I'm the cutest.
8667280	8670400	You're more like the fabulous.
8670400	8671120	Fine.
8671120	8672880	I'm fabulous and cute.
8672880	8673880	All right, bye.
8673880	8675720	Bye.
8675720	8676760	Let's take another call.
8676760	8677560	I'm done with Rama.
8677560	8679020	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.
8679020	8680200	Who's this?
8680200	8682240	The Werenate.
8682240	8683400	What's the name?
8683400	8684240	The Werenate.
8684240	8685080	The Werenate.
8685080	8686480	What's up?
8686480	8688640	Yeah, I was calling because I want
8688640	8691840	to comment on your Modern Warfare 3.
8691840	8694680	Oh, you're going to be pre-ordering on the Wii?
8694680	8697280	Most likely.
8697280	8698000	Sucker.
8698000	8698720	Why is that?
8698720	8700600	Is that all you got?
8700600	8703920	Yeah, because I'm a diehard Nintendo fan.
8703920	8706440	Long live Nintendo.
8706440	8709680	And also, I mean, I played Modern Warfare 1 on the Wii.
8709680	8710640	And it was pretty nice.
8710640	8711520	It had online play.
8711520	8713280	Why are you saying it won't have online play?
8713280	8715120	You've got to do the waggle.
8715120	8718200	I'm just, it'll have online play.
8718200	8721200	But it's not going to be as robust as with the voice
8721200	8723480	chat and all that to say something like Xbox Live
8723480	8724680	or PlayStation Network.
8724680	8727360	It'll just be, which might actually, to be fair,
8727360	8728320	might be for the best.
8728320	8730680	Because you don't want to play those games on Xbox Live
8730680	8732160	because people are just rude.
8732160	8735360	I mean, if you shoot someone or blow their head off
8735360	8737520	in real life, do you want to have voice chat with them
8737520	8740680	or you just want to get the job done?
8740680	8741560	Touche.
8741560	8742320	Fine.
8742320	8743920	The caller has a point.
8743920	8745040	I stand corrected.
8745040	8747880	Yes, I do want to have voice chat with them.
8747880	8748920	Excuse me.
8748920	8751640	I don't like the fact very much that you just blew off my head.
8751640	8754640	I think you should promptly apologize for that, actually.
8754640	8757680	Yeah, you know, so I'm a Wii user,
8757680	8759960	but I can't wait for the Wii U. You know,
8759960	8762680	I think you all should be glorifying the Wii U,
8762680	8765400	because it's going to be a pretty epic system.
8765400	8768080	Not until we see the games.
8768080	8769840	What we saw at E3 wasn't enough.
8769840	8772040	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
8772040	8774440	And I am not convinced yet.
8774440	8776920	I mean, yes, they talked about some of these third party games,
8776920	8778800	but they talked about games that are already
8778800	8781720	coming out this holiday that might not even really end up
8781720	8782560	in their same form.
8782560	8784680	Like, they talked about the Assassin's Creed game
8784680	8786560	is not the same game that's coming out
8786560	8789000	this holiday for the other systems, like a separate game.
8789000	8792320	So I'm not sold one way or the other on Wii U.
8792320	8794960	I mean, I'll probably buy one at launch
8794960	8799080	because I buy every other system at launch, but.
8799080	8800480	Do you now see the tech demos?
8800480	8803320	I mean, come on, it had like tech in on it.
8803320	8804160	Come on.
8804160	8808400	It's going to be changing to more hardcore.
8808400	8810840	You suddenly sound like you're underwater, but that's all right.
8810840	8812000	Dalek voice.
8812000	8814320	Yes, he's got the Dalek voice going on.
8814320	8818240	But I don't know.
8818240	8823760	The demos, it's interesting, but let me ask you this.
8823760	8826000	Can't the Vita and the PlayStation 3
8826000	8830560	essentially do the same thing?
8830560	8839080	I'm almost muted, but the Vita is not even better than a 3DS.
8839080	8843200	Well, it's got, well, I don't know about that.
8843200	8844280	It's kind of relative.
8844280	8846200	It depends on what games it gets.
8846200	8847800	I don't know about the processors.
8847800	8851880	Put them side by side, but I imagine that, sorry,
8851880	8854560	Loki showing off his cheating in his game.
8854560	8859000	He's cheating, getting 5 million tower bucks from cheating.
8859000	8861400	That's a lot cheaper than buying that.
8861400	8862360	Anyway, sorry.
8862360	8867960	I would like to say that I hope that the re-ware is more,
8867960	8869360	is better than what it is now.
8869360	8872560	Because as a developer, I hope that I
8872560	8876120	can see some better games besides that roller skating
8876120	8878960	game and roller goo on there.
8878960	8881200	And the one with the guys in the Speedos
8881200	8883440	trying to get through the walls, that was a real fun game,
8883440	8884440	actually.
8884440	8887000	No, I'm glad you can say something critical
8887000	8889120	about Nintendo, because I was getting a little worried
8889120	8890880	that you were a little bit too much fanboy.
8890880	8892080	But yes, I agree.
8892080	8894680	They're online as a whole really needs to improve.
8894680	8895560	So I hope they do it.
8895560	8898440	But I will say the 3DS has done some things right online.
8898440	8899640	So we'll see.
8899640	8903960	I don't have one yet, but you can save me one if you want.
8903960	8904560	We'll see.
8904560	8906400	We might have a contest around the holidays.
8906400	8906920	All right.
8906920	8909200	Anyhow, I got to let you go so we can get more calls.
8909200	8910400	But thanks for the input.
8910400	8911080	Take care, buddy.
8911080	8911880	Rene signing out.
8911880	8913360	Later.
8913360	8914680	Let's take another call here.
8914680	8916020	Hi, you're on Orange Dogs Radio.
8916020	8916960	Who's this?
8916960	8917480	Yo, guys.
8917480	8918960	It's Xenocore from the OKC.
8918960	8919520	How you doing?
8919520	8921720	What is up, Xenocore from OKC?
8921720	8923240	What's in your mind tonight?
8923240	8923720	Not much.
8923720	8927200	Just been playing a bit of Earth Defense Force 2011.
8927200	8929600	Oh, a game that's near and dear to Loki's heart.
8929600	8931200	What do you think?
8931200	8933240	It's not bad, but I'm not even sure
8933240	8934480	if the game has an ending yet.
8934480	8936920	I've been playing it online so I can have some backup.
8936920	8941440	And every time it gets to the last minute, it just resets.
8941440	8943360	Loki, is this a problem?
8943360	8946640	Well, the very last mission, I mean,
8946640	8948560	depends on what difficulty you're playing on.
8948560	8952840	The ending's not very long.
8952840	8955000	Well, I never think the ending would be that long.
8955000	8957160	In this whole game, it's the gameplay itself.
8957160	8959480	But I do at least want to know what the hell happened,
8959480	8961960	because it's just like all your characters have vanished.
8961960	8963880	Yeah, you just have to play it on a harder difficulty,
8963880	8966640	because each time you beat the game on a harder difficulty,
8966640	8968440	the ending's longer and longer.
8968440	8968940	OK.
8968940	8970320	It would have been nice if they'd
8970320	8972200	be some sort of a hint, like, play this on a harder
8972200	8974680	difficulty to find out what happens or something like that.
8974680	8979440	Well, I think they also have DLC coming, so it's hard to say
8979440	8980800	what exactly they'll be having.
8980800	8981280	Let's see.
8981280	8985280	And I've been playing the hell out of 4K Kill Team as well.
8985280	8987360	You're cutting in and out a little bit there,
8987360	8988320	but that's all right.
8988320	8990680	You've been playing the hell out of what?
8990680	8992600	Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team.
8992600	8994600	Oh, didn't you mention this game on an earlier
8994600	8995440	episode of the show?
8995440	8996360	I think you did.
8996360	8998360	Yeah, I finally grabbed the whole thing.
8998360	9002400	It's not bad for 10 bucks, definitely worth the money.
9002400	9003840	Might have to look into that.
9003840	9005920	What else have you been playing, anything else?
9005920	9007320	No, that's about it.
9007320	9009480	Trying to save some money.
9009480	9011240	Any new stories you want to talk about tonight
9011240	9012880	that we talked about on the show?
9012880	9014800	Well, I did want to comment on the whole thing
9014800	9019680	about the Diablo III going online only,
9019680	9022200	and what company aspects of that are.
9022200	9022840	Go ahead.
9022840	9024120	You're still cutting in and out a little bit.
9024120	9025320	I don't know what's going on with the connection,
9025320	9027040	but I'll let you get your thought out there.
9027040	9029320	I can understand you enough.
9029320	9032080	Blizzard knows that everything is possible with code.
9032080	9034760	All they need is time.
9034760	9037840	Granted, they do have to do something for copy protection,
9037840	9043160	but honestly, if they think this is going to stop anything,
9043160	9045800	then they really need to go get their coding team
9045800	9047600	and re-evaluate who's working for them,
9047600	9050520	because whoever told me that this is going to defeat
9050520	9053880	online hacking is ridiculous, because it happens.
9053880	9056560	Well, the Warcraft right now looks right.
9056560	9059040	That's true, but they ban players from World of Warcraft
9059040	9060440	left and right, too, right?
9060440	9062800	Yeah, but that won't keep them from getting back in the game.
9062800	9063680	I guess that's true.
9063680	9064760	What about StarCraft II?
9064760	9066040	What are the issues that that game's having?
9066040	9067120	Are they having issues, too?
9067120	9068480	I guess, but I guess you don't know.
9068480	9069800	Well, they have their own variety of issues.
9069800	9072600	It's not so much because there's no real persistence
9072600	9074520	in the game, other than you think,
9074520	9077080	but you'll see people do lag hacks and stuff
9077080	9079720	to interfere with the other player's game.
9079720	9081280	Remove the fog of wars, you can see
9081280	9083680	what your player is doing without having you nearby.
9083680	9086320	More gameplay hacks more than anything else.
9086320	9088760	And it's even more critical to the play of the game,
9088760	9091920	so it does more damage.
9091920	9095880	I am very curious to see just how legally this all plays out,
9095880	9097960	especially when the first exploit does come down
9097960	9100200	the hill, and then suddenly it's impacting the real money
9100200	9101120	trading house.
9101120	9102960	They've got to be thinking of something.
9102960	9105360	There's got to be something in place they're doing.
9105360	9107040	I mean, they're swearing up and down
9107040	9109160	that they've looked at it from a legal perspective,
9109160	9112200	but just because it's totally legal right now, too,
9112200	9114880	doesn't mean it will always be legal.
9114880	9116560	That's the other thing I kind of worry about with them.
9116560	9118800	Especially when they have, the main thing
9118800	9120880	is between Second Life and this.
9120880	9124000	Second Life, people are making the assets themselves.
9124000	9126320	The game isn't supplying them with the assets.
9126320	9127840	If you supply them with the assets,
9127840	9129880	technically Blizzard still owns them.
9129880	9132640	At Second Life, you have rights to whatever you create.
9134200	9136320	That's interesting, you're just kind of paying.
9136320	9138840	It's going to be very, very strange what happens with it,
9138840	9140580	but we'll see what happens once the politicians
9140580	9141920	pull their heads out their asses.
9141920	9144040	Blizzard is going to be printing money with this.
9144040	9144880	It's going to be very interesting.
9144880	9146160	All right, Xenocore, I got to let you go.
9146160	9148880	Skype's acting up, so take care, buddy, okay?
9148880	9149720	All right, later, man.
9149720	9150880	Have a good one.
9150880	9153280	All right, thank you, listeners.
9153280	9154540	I wanted to hear his thoughts on that,
9154540	9155640	and I know he's cutting in and out.
9155640	9156460	It's probably a little annoying,
9156460	9157300	but I wanted to hear what,
9157300	9158720	I was able to understand most of it.
9158720	9159640	Let me go back to Twitter,
9159640	9160640	because I got to get through some more
9160640	9161700	of these Twitter topics here,
9161700	9163080	and then I'll see if any more calls
9163080	9164480	are coming in at that point.
9165560	9169640	More Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O-L-R
9169640	9171080	as I load them up here.
9171080	9174240	Let's see, we actually don't have a whole lot tonight.
9174240	9175640	Let me go to,
9177880	9178900	Retertainment says,
9178900	9180040	I meant to email you,
9180040	9183160	but can you warn people that deep vein thrombosis
9183160	9184400	is serious.
9184400	9187360	Get up and walk around about every two hours.
9187360	9190360	Yeah, when they say take a break
9190360	9191600	during a long gaming session,
9191600	9192440	they're not kidding.
9192440	9193680	You really should get up and take a break.
9193680	9195120	Even when we raid in WoW,
9195120	9197440	we take a quote unquote bio break
9197440	9199600	every couple hours for a few minutes.
9199600	9201380	You know, that's a chance for folks to get up,
9201380	9203960	get water, stay hydrated, get a snack,
9203960	9205400	go to the restroom and so forth.
9205400	9206240	It's just good practice.
9206240	9208920	Well yeah, that guy sat down I think for 12 hours.
9208920	9211680	Are we talking about the guy in overseas
9211680	9212840	that like died or whatever?
9212840	9213680	Yeah.
9214920	9217040	Yeah, what was that all about?
9217040	9219160	12 hour gaming session.
9219160	9220120	It'll kill ya.
9224040	9227160	Alright, moving on to more tweets at twitter.com slash O-L-R.
9227160	9230360	A couple from Tiger Claw back to back here.
9230360	9235360	North Korea's Kim Jong Il is running MMO gold farming racket
9235440	9237320	is the tweet that's sent here.
9237320	9239360	This is a news story from Game Informer
9239360	9241200	delivered to us from Tiger Claw.
9241200	9243900	The New York Times is reporting that North Korea
9243900	9246100	is using a team of hackers to infiltrate
9246100	9250200	popular South Korean MMORPGs and farm in-game points.
9250200	9252220	Specially trained North Korean hackers
9252220	9256380	working in concert with South Korean and Chinese operatives
9256380	9259480	have been infiltrating popular MMOs like Lineage
9259480	9261000	accumulating in-game points,
9261000	9263260	selling them on the internet black market.
9264100	9265780	Wow, the Times say that they've earned
9265780	9267740	over six million dollars for their efforts,
9267740	9269240	over half of which has been delivered
9269240	9272120	to North Korean agents in the capital of Pyongyang.
9273040	9275960	Yeah, so please don't support this stuff
9275960	9278260	because that's just, I mean, look.
9279720	9281400	People are gonna do whatever they have to do to make money.
9281400	9283160	That's fine, but when you support it,
9283160	9286480	like you're supporting devious tactics like hacking,
9286480	9289180	like credit card information getting stolen and so forth,
9289180	9291520	it's all going to ruin your gameplay experience.
9291520	9294040	And that's why now ultimately Diablo 3
9294040	9297120	is gonna require an internet connection, right?
9298880	9300760	Tiger Claw also links us to this story
9300760	9303160	and usually I let people only have two stories,
9303160	9306440	but I gotta say, this one is of definite relevant interest
9306440	9309000	to at least one person here in studio.
9309000	9312360	Tiger Claw tweets us about Ragnarok Online.
9312360	9313720	Yay.
9313720	9316560	Has launched an iOS companion game
9316560	9320560	for its popular MMORPG, now out in its ninth year.
9320560	9324580	Ragnarok Violet is a single-player experience
9324580	9326720	that utilizes many of the same functions,
9326720	9330340	mechanics, and environments as the original.
9330340	9332840	So it's kind of like, I guess, a spinoff mobile game
9332840	9334460	that lets you have a single-player experience
9334460	9335300	of Ragnarok.
9335300	9336960	What does it say in America?
9336960	9340760	It does not say, oh no, it looks like it is in US.
9340760	9342480	You can read the description on the App Store
9342480	9345280	and I click on it and it takes me to the US App Store
9345280	9346600	for Ragnarok Violet.
9346600	9347440	I'm looking up, looking for it.
9347440	9349640	I didn't even get that sentence out of my mouth
9349640	9352300	and Dark Sakura, I heard the click on the iPhone.
9354360	9355200	Shut up.
9355200	9356020	It's free.
9356880	9358360	But, oh, there's in-game items,
9358360	9361240	like you can get pet eggs and all this crap.
9361240	9362640	It's like a free thing.
9363960	9365560	Way to go, Tiger Claw.
9365560	9368280	We just lost Dark Sakura to Ragnarok all over again.
9368280	9370280	Thanks, Tiger Claw.
9370280	9372120	Yeah, but the one problem is that if it works
9372120	9376040	with my IRO account and I'm not playing IRO anymore,
9376040	9377640	then I might be kind of SOL.
9377640	9380120	Dark Tetsuya in our chat reminds us about a birthday
9380120	9382080	that happened saying, yesterday there was a birthday
9382080	9384500	that harkens back to our music game roots.
9384500	9387800	Taku Sakiyakiabra, I probably mispronounced that name
9387800	9390160	really horribly, turned another year older.
9390160	9393460	But you guys all know Taku or T-A-Q, not Taco,
9393460	9396400	but Taku, turned a year older.
9396400	9398160	How old does that make him?
9398160	9398980	I don't know.
9398980	9399820	A year older.
9399820	9400760	A year older.
9400760	9402000	But here you go, guys.
9402000	9404020	Enjoy some Birthday Holic.
9404020	9409020	There you go, Birthday Holic for Taku.
9409680	9412080	All right, let's go to Black Lab.
9412080	9412920	Remember him?
9412920	9415920	He used to come to this show like years and years ago,
9415920	9418120	like in the first 100 episodes or so.
9418120	9420800	He's listening tonight and sends his tweets
9420800	9422080	and has some Twitter questions.
9422080	9425280	Number one, will there be a drunk show soon?
9425280	9426120	Probably not.
9426120	9427300	I gave up drinking.
9428600	9429440	Probably not.
9429440	9430840	Not that old.
9430840	9433680	Question two, does Jamie still have that copy
9433680	9435080	of Owen Don that I gave her?
9435080	9436080	Happy face.
9436080	9438640	Yes, it's actually in my DS case right now.
9438640	9440560	Actually, I think it's in my DS right now.
9440560	9441920	And you should say if he wants it back,
9441920	9444020	he has to come be on the show again.
9444020	9445760	He gave it to me.
9445760	9446600	Oh, he gave, oh, I thought it was like-
9446600	9448600	Actually, I think I paid him for it.
9448600	9450000	Oh, I sound like a, oh, I thought,
9450000	9451560	the way it was phrased, it sounded like a loner
9451560	9452840	or something like that.
9452840	9453680	Oh well.
9453680	9456120	Also, another last minute question from Black Lab.
9456120	9458160	How to get a Nintendo fan girl
9458160	9461680	to try playing non-Zelda games?
9461680	9464880	Well, if she's not playing non-Zelda games,
9464880	9468680	then she's not much of a fangirl, is she, of Nintendo.
9468680	9471660	Dark Sakura, I don't know, you're the girl.
9471660	9472960	How do you convince other girls
9472960	9474560	to play games that aren't Zelda?
9475800	9478800	Pass over your DS and say, here, give this a go.
9478800	9481000	What if they say, no, I'm too busy.
9482400	9483520	Busy doing what?
9483520	9484440	My hair.
9485320	9486200	Oh, well, that's important.
9486200	9488240	Baking a pie.
9488240	9489280	As long as they share the pie.
9489280	9491720	Doing my application for the tester.
9491720	9492880	I already did that.
9495040	9496680	There's always time for games.
9499280	9500640	I'm updating my echo phone.
9500640	9504160	Find something where there's like a Barbie mode
9504160	9506320	where you can do dress up or customization
9506320	9507480	because women like that shit.
9507480	9510200	No, you wanna know what's funny is that,
9512600	9515080	I seriously think that wrestling games,
9515080	9518440	those WWF games or whatever, WBE games,
9518440	9523000	are like dress up dolls for dudes.
9523000	9524760	Because seriously, you can change your outfit.
9524760	9528240	I've seen Dan spend hours making wrestlers.
9528240	9529720	It's freaking hilarious.
9531200	9532040	All right.
9532040	9534040	Oh, and also changing the bikinis out
9534040	9536020	on Dead or Alive volleyball.
9537620	9538920	All right, that's gonna do it
9538920	9541340	for the Twitter tonight and the Skype line.
9541340	9543400	Thank you guys so much for your tweets and your calls.
9543400	9544980	If you didn't get through tonight,
9544980	9545820	send us an email.
9545820	9547700	Mailbag at orangelongerator.com
9547700	9550920	or send us a tweet for next week at twitter.com slash O-L-R.
9550920	9552320	In the meantime, I'm gonna go over to Loki
9552320	9554480	and see if there's any last minute stories tonight.
9554480	9555320	I don't think there is.
9555320	9556160	I think we got it all, but.
9556160	9558320	Yeah, it was really slow.
9558320	9559740	Yeah, it was kind of a slow news week,
9559740	9561360	hence why it's kind of a shorter show tonight.
9561360	9563760	But they can't always be action packed weeks,
9563760	9565120	especially as we get closer and closer.
9565120	9566720	Once we get after Labor Day,
9566720	9568160	it's just gonna be go, go, go, go, go
9568160	9569040	till the end of the year.
9569040	9570920	So we'll see.
9570920	9573100	All right, well, that means we're coming to the close
9573100	9574740	of another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9574740	9577520	And I want to thank all you guys for listening this week.

9607640	9609760	It makes it all worthwhile to be here again.
9609760	9612520	And for Dark Sakura to make an audition tape
9612520	9615600	that you all can vote on soon for this show
9615600	9617520	that I can't believe she's actually going to go on.
9617520	9619760	Let me just check all of my Sony stuff behind me.
9619760	9622280	Go look at this shit.
9622280	9623200	You owe me.
9624680	9626320	All right, let's go around
9626320	9628720	and get everybody's final thought tonight.
9628720	9629800	Loki, we'll start with you.
9629800	9631640	The cheating cheater of Tiny Tower,
9631640	9635560	the hacker who has five million Tower bucks
9635560	9636940	that he did not purchase.
9637880	9640740	And it's basically infinite because it's not going down.
9641640	9643080	What's your final thought tonight?
9643080	9645460	My final thought is I have 13 floors already.
9647880	9650360	Dark Sakura, what's your final thought tonight?
9650360	9651260	Hire me.
9652400	9657080	And my final thought tonight is tacos.
9657080	9658360	That's going to do it for another week
9658360	9659640	here at Orange Launch Radio.
9659640	9660960	Thanks again for tuning in.
