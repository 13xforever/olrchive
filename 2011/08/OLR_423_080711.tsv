14078	23235	Tonight, August 7th, 2011, the Vita gets bumped to 2012, the Humble Indie Bundle adds even more games, and can you soon make a living playing Diablo 3?
31468	38673	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39133	42575	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
42936	46478	First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
46618	46898	Hi.
47238	47839	How are you, Jamie?
47939	49460	I'm a culinary fucking goddess.
50580	51561	Congratulations.
51841	53522	What makes you a culinary fucking goddess?
53602	55804	Because I'm sharing one of my favorite recipes with you guys today.
56135	57216	And what would that recipe be?
57496	58137	Monkey's brains?
58417	58537	No.
59958	63941	While, you know, famous in Cantonese cuisine is rarely seen in the United States.
64722	65222	Touche.
65302	66523	Or in Washington, D.C., I should say.
67564	76771	No, they are blue potatoes baked instead of fried, but baked with garlic, marjoram, oregano, Himalayan salt, pepper.
77371	78292	Himalayan salt?
78392	79953	I asked for Mongolian salt.
80013	80834	God damn it.
81114	84577	Lots of garlic and plenty of Italian cheeses.
85197	87358	Oh, well, garlic salt always makes things better.
87378	89259	Okay, I will, I will, but I've got to set up the show first.
89939	90179	All right.
90959	95761	Say hello as well to less of a culinary goddess, but still pretty awesome, Tech Master Loki.
96802	97302	How's it going?
97642	98002	I'm good.
98022	98642	How are you, Loki?
99082	99583	Pretty good.
99843	100103	Yeah?
100363	100983	What's new with you?
102424	102844	Not much.
102944	105245	Has there been any culinary works in your life?
105305	110327	I know you used to deep fry everything in good times.
111347	113188	Yeah, I haven't really done any deep frying in a while.
114398	114995	Well that's too bad.
116491	138878	Alright, well, let's start talking about games with you guys in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com If you've never joined us for a live show, you should sometime Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at AllGamesRadio, www.allgames.com And, yep, we have our chatters there Let's see, TigerClaw says Rob, did you just say monkeys?
139078	146100	Then you must have seen the new Planet of the Apes Nope, didn't see the new Planet of the Apes I heard it was number one in the box office, so it did way better than everyone thought it would
146300	147401	And they threw lots of number two.
147781	151043	I used to hate those movies actually growing up.
151183	155785	Like, I think my dad or my brother or somebody really liked those movies and I always thought they were terrible.
156025	156866	Like the Charlton Heston.
157146	158647	I really don't like Charlton Heston.
159027	163429	Like it has nothing to do with the politics side or the gun, my cold dead hands on stuff.
163749	166311	Just, I just, God, I don't know.
166391	168832	Like something about him in movies just irritates me.
169192	169653	I don't know.
170133	171974	I'm sure there's a lot of people that would disagree and that's fine.
172674	173835	Sometimes we disagree on this show.
174244	174784	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
198086	204771	There's also, I saw Bobby posted on Twitter, there's a Bad Dudes reference in there somewhere.
204831	207953	Like a bad enough dude to take on, or to save the president or whatever.
208314	209855	Was that line from the original Bad Dudes game?
210235	211316	Yeah, it's pretty funny though.
212297	216380	And I actually didn't play any Groove Coaster.
216800	217320	That's too bad.
217700	218101	It's fine.
218641	219422	I played a lot of WoW.
220483	222744	Mostly because I've been forever alone.
223805	224886	My husband's gone.
225646	226467	He'll be back next week though.
227318	228839	You've been neglecting your consoles.
229619	230019	A little bit.
230039	234242	I actually was going to go in and play the Saturn, and I was like, I gotta do what to hook it up?
234362	234782	Never mind.
236403	236663	Alright.
236983	242226	There's actually an email that I was reading in the emails, we'll have to get to later on, that kind of asks you about playing the old games in the vault.
242506	242746	Yep.
242806	243766	Curious to hear about that later.
244227	247008	But we'll get to that in part B. Alright, well Loki, how was your gaming week?
248772	249472	It was okay.
249633	252114	I played lots of Groove Coaster.
252274	253115	That game's pretty fun.
253955	258558	Almost seems like it should be like a Q Games game, but here it's not.
260559	264261	More Grand Theft Auto and more Earth Defense Force.
266282	268963	Actually, a lot of Earth Defense Force this week, which is kind of cool.
269744	271725	Leveling up my tactical guy.
271985	275647	Finished going through... Well, I had already gone through all the...
278442	278962	Normal Mode Level Up
299893	300634	So that's pretty much it.
301134	302735	Oh, and now, of course, Tiny Tower.
303055	305537	Because I have to join the cult that is Tiny Tower.
305597	306378	Are you on Game Center?
306538	307198	No, you don't use that.
307318	307799	Yeah, I use that.
308039	309039	Oh, you have to add me on there.
309200	309520	Oh, no, no.
310380	311281	I do have you on there.
311521	313603	You are the only person that's on my Game Center.
313643	316845	But I don't see your tower yet because you didn't start playing until today.
316945	317805	So I got it.
318146	318326	Yes.
318726	320349	Alright, my game of the week.
320569	326578	I picked up the Humble Indie Bundle, which I know is going to come up in the show later, so I'll talk more about the bundle itself when it comes up in the news later.
326979	332607	But one of the games in the Humble Indie Bundle has been taking up a lot of my time, and that's because I think it's terrific.
332687	333489	It's a terrific game.
334129	358476	and it's one of those games it's been brought up on the show before and I distinctly remember somebody had called in at the end of the year last year to say that this was their favorite game of the year and I was like oh I'll have to check that out at some point you know and amongst all the other games I try to fit into today I just never got around to it until now but now that I play this game it's just like taking up all my time that I'm not playing like WoW or an MMO or something and that's VVVVVV
360156	360556	Oh my god.
360576	361557	The game is fucking cracked.
361577	363678	This game is outstanding.
364138	372982	It is like Super Metroid meets the Commodore 64 meets an incredibly simple premise of you press button, flip gravity.
373582	375423	I mean, this game could have been on the Commodore 64.
376284	378125	That's obviously kind of like the style they're going for.
378645	382847	But the music adds like...
383807	386410	So much to it because the music is amazing in the game.
386670	387851	It's all chiptune type stuff.
387871	392115	If you like the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack, Super Meat Boy, that type of stuff, you'll love the soundtrack to this.
392635	396699	And obviously it takes a lot of influences from more recent gaming.
397359	406747	I think if you like Super Meat Boy, this type of game is right up your alley because it's about dying over and over and over again on a level until you get it just right.
407028	409710	But then there's that whole exploration and open world thing.
409990	410550	Thanks for watching!
439318	443842	Like one dungeon or whatever you want to call it that I was in had tripwires.
444162	446584	And whenever you hit the tripwire, the gravity automatically flipped.
446904	452769	And so you really had to kind of maneuver your character to hit tripwires, sometimes sequentially, to get through the room without landing on spikes.
453429	457692	Another area I was in was all about warping from one side of the room to the other.
458073	462076	Like the only way to escape a room would be from one predetermined exit.
462256	462957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
477253	477733	Thanks for watching!
495085	497746	I guess it all just kind of makes a mood.
497807	498127	I don't know.
498207	502989	I honestly think if the game had just done new graphics, it would have been horribly overlooked.
503389	508070	I think sometimes that whole little retro catch kind of adds a lot to the game.
508351	511372	There's not just, by the way, the open world Metroid-y part of the game.
511392	513813	There's also time trial levels that you can play and...
515773	543765	you can play made up worlds like there's like a little level packs in it and so forth so yeah amazing deal because right now you could get this game for a dollar if you wanted to I think you're kind of cheap if you do but I understand some people are broke and in school and what have you it's honestly if you miss the Humble Indie Bundle altogether it's worth the $10 on Steam I think so especially if you like like if you like Super Meat Boy and those type of games retro fan this game is right up your alley
544185	545266	I bought it when it was two bucks.
545806	546887	Oh nice, during the Steam sales?
547388	547948	Way back.
548328	548989	I've had it for a while.
549329	549569	Cool.
550150	550810	It's really good.
551010	551671	It's a great game.
552131	554053	So yeah, that was taking up a lot of my time this week.
554073	555314	I played some of the other stuff in the bundle.
555354	561098	I played COGS for a little bit, which is kind of like a puzzle game that's all about, like you know the sliding puzzles, right?
561278	561919	You know when you have
563260	564140	The picture ones.
578247	586152	It's just like you have to move, instead of making a picture, it's like the dual puzzle of line up the wheels right so that way it powers the machine.
586553	589895	It's kind of got that whole like steampunk-ish vibe, but not really.
589915	590175	I don't know.
590195	594117	It's a very puzzle-y interface and so forth.
594158	595478	So yeah, that was fun.
596859	597980	Those are kind of the big ones I've checked out.
598040	599140	Otherwise, most of the same stuff.
599421	601182	Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIII.
601222	602862	Randomly played Wipeout this week.
603063	606724	I don't know, just wanted to play F-Zero and didn't feel like cooking up the GameCube.
606745	607785	So I'm like, oh, let's play Wipeout.
607825	608746	It's about the next best thing.
609426	611407	Yeah, there you go.
611427	612468	That was my gaming week.
613468	616109	So, let's get into some gaming news.

640356	640896	Question for you.
640956	641156	Yes.
641556	642156	What did you think?
642976	643056	Of?
643657	644017	The dish.
644357	644957	Oh, what you made?
644977	646257	Am I a culinary goddess or what?
647037	650498	Well, I've been talking most times, so I haven't been able to really eat it, but it's really good.
650618	650978	I like it.
651218	651918	See, everybody?
651978	652598	I'm awesome.
653278	655699	I don't want to inflate your ego too much.
656479	659739	You're going to have to go on Hell's Kitchen or something and get your ego kicked out a little bit.
659779	662620	No, because I would punch What's-His-Face.
663400	666500	I'd be like, you're much nicer to the people on MasterChef.
669001	669661	Gordon Ramsay.
670632	670952	All right.
671813	672193	Let's see.
673113	675635	Going to the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
675975	681058	Spazinator PC in chat says, if there was a sequel to VVVVVV, would it be called VVVVVV2?
682279	683920	VVVV was 70s or WWWW?
684180	686121	I think it would be WWWW.
686221	688022	I think it would probably be a letter repeated.
688062	691024	The soundtrack is called PPPPPPP.
692224	692825	PPPPPPP.
695146	697849	But all the songs on the soundtrack start with P, so it's kind of cute.
699090	703976	Actdeft in the chatroom says, VVVVVV is like Portal, but in 8-bit goodness.
704937	708861	Blackwolf said he just paid $25 for the Humble Indie Bundle, split between the devs.
710222	712285	Breakman says, sliding tile puzzles?
712585	715628	Ugh, I think I'd rather glue my forehead to a donkey's ass.
716069	716890	An ass's ass.
718471	721153	Uh, it's, it's neater than it sounds.
721253	724315	I don't think this, it really depends what types of games you're into.
724375	728077	Like, if you like action-y type of games, you're probably not going to get so much out of COGS.
728357	731579	But there's some people that just, to kill time, like to sit there and play a little puzzler.
732060	736102	Like, you know, some of you probably play Plants vs. Zombies, Bejeweled, those are puzzlers.
736422	737723	This is kind of right up that same alley.
739084	739764	Alright, there you go.
739784	743206	Uh, chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday night.
743286	744887	Let's get to some gaming news.
744967	745708	We'll start off with Loki.
746963	747243	Ah, yes.
748284	752087	Um, apparently, the PlayStation Vita will not be coming out this year.
753148	753548	Too bad.
753708	758712	At least, not over here in the United States or North America or in Europe.
759792	761173	It said it'll be coming out in early 2012.
761293	766978	Of course, I'm assuming, Sony being a Japanese company, the Japanese will get theirs holiday, 2011.
767018	767118	Um...
770535	782119	But yeah, right now, no real reason given other than, you know, I don't know that they're delaying it.
782219	795883	I think it's a good idea because if it means either more units being produced so that they don't have shortages or, you know, to have better games coming out at launch, I mean, both of those things would definitely help them out.
797203	804226	and of course they were asked whether they'd be lowering their price because Nintendo did it on the 3DS.
804266	807047	They lowered their price to compete with the Vita.
807907	812168	They basically said we packed so much into the device and made it very affordable.
812668	819911	There's no need to lower the price just because somebody else happens to be in the video game business and decided that they were going to lower their price.
821889	829133	And honestly, there is a lot of components in the Vita, but if that shit isn't going to sell at launch, they will lower the price.
830634	832275	That's just the way things are.
834697	844283	Something else that got delayed to early 2012 as well, that'd be Twisted Metal, which was supposed to be coming out in October, and now it's early 2012.
844923	844963	Um...
848430	854273	They basically said, you know, late game is only late until it ships.
854934	857315	A bad game is bad until the end of time.
858956	860517	Great quote.
862178	869422	If we ship Twisted Metal tomorrow, going off the response from folks who have played it, I assure you it would never be a bad game.
872924	876066	But yes, they're spending the extra time polishing the game.
879562	879982	I can wait.
880703	881223	It'll be awesome.
882104	884486	Yeah, that game's been in development for quite some time now, hasn't it?
885246	885587	Yep.
887148	889069	So let's go back to the Vita being delayed.
889510	891251	What does it boil down to, the cost for delay?
891331	891911	It's parts?
892452	893893	It's strategical?
894013	894713	What's going on?
895214	899597	Because you kind of knew about this before the rest of the internet did, didn't you?
899857	900077	Yes.
900938	901438	So what's up?
902840	904241	Nothing really, they didn't say.
904641	906302	They said it's 2012. 2012.
909403	913907	Part of me wondered if maybe they saw what the 3DS was doing wrong.
914567	918711	And that was that the 3DS launched without really having any good games at launch.
919491	919932	Debatable.
920012	925276	I understand Street Fighter 4 has its fans, but let's face it, that was a port of a game that had already been out for a couple years, right?
925336	928299	And if that's your strongest release title, something's up.
929299	934304	So maybe they were looking at that going, well, what do we have coming out at launch on the Vita?
935205	939350	If these developers aren't really ready to put out all-star games, maybe now's not the time to put out the Vita.
939930	942333	Because that was where my mind went.
943255	946619	I said, well, maybe the Uncharted people weren't ready to put out the game.
947160	951205	And if that's your biggest game and that's going to get delayed, let's just delay the whole damn thing.
953427	953688	Could be.
954068	978348	Let's call the whole thing off Apparently So Alright, well Going to chat.orangeloungeradio.com Black Lab is in chat tonight saying I can tell Rob started talking mid-chew Hey, I gotta eat sometime When I got something to say, I'm gonna say it Let's see Breakman in chat says I got a PSP at full price, if only I'd waited
978948	981170	Well, here's a newsflash.
981650	988915	You could wait to get a Vita, too, but it's probably going to take a long time for the price to drop on that, especially if it comes out in the first part of next year.
990676	995359	There could be a small price drop at the end of next year going into holiday 2012.
997563	998383	But that's not for sure.
998943	1001604	I'd be interested in the Vita if they had Saints Row on that.
1002564	1003484	Or Grand Theft Auto.
1003844	1004745	Might just be a matter of time.
1004765	1006865	Either one of those is very interchangeable.
1007125	1008285	Or Earth Defense Force.
1009906	1012986	Any of those three, I would definitely be down for a Vita.
1013026	1020508	But as of right now, I've seen how much I play my 3DS, which is not at all.
1022029	1024109	So I just don't need another system cluttering up.
1025689	1035201	My bank account Alright, well let's talk about the other handheld The 3DS Oh, before we get to 3DS actually Let me ask one more question Does this change your opinion at all about the Vita?
1035461	1039106	And I asked this to chat too Does it change your opinion thus far of the Vita?
1039166	1041168	Does it change the fact whether you want one or not?
1042209	1043550	For me, I'll start.
1043670	1045292	No, it doesn't really change my opinion of the Vita.
1045352	1049715	In fact, I actually kind of say, you know what, if you're not ready, then that's cool.
1049775	1051916	Take your time until you've got a really solid launch lineup.
1052517	1061343	And B, the fact that the holidays are going to be killer anyway, I'm kind of glad to not have to spend $250 right now on a Vita as well because you know I'll have to have it.
1061803	1064765	So actually, I'm not so bothered by this.
1065586	1066166	What about you guys?
1066526	1066786	Loki?
1068127	1077550	I was kind of just warm about the Vita to begin with, and nothing really stood out so far with the Vita that says, I gotta have that system.
1078670	1082511	So until I see something like that, then I don't really have to have that system.
1085686	1087108	It depends on finances.
1087288	1095057	I mean, the Vita looks nice, hooray, but I hardly touch my PSP, so why would I want to touch the new one?
1095458	1099903	I really didn't play the PSP that much except for Popolo Cross and Loco Roco.
1100695	1102517	There's gonna have to be those must-have games.
1102817	1105099	Yeah, it's really gonna be more of a matter of games.
1105139	1109944	I mean, even Dissidia wasn't really enough to make me really want to play my PSP.
1110184	1117310	See, I got on board with PSP early because the very first time I played Luminous, I was like, oh my god, this is the best music puzzle game ever.
1117330	1119032	We had a PSP the day they came out.
1119252	1121654	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1141654	1147416	And, but, I mean, I've played stuff that I've liked, but it's never been really enough to keep me.
1147536	1149736	I mean, I've taken it on trips and watched movies on it.
1150477	1153617	Now I have a netbook, so I watch movies on that instead.
1154258	1155878	Let's go to the chatters and see what they have to say.
1155938	1161360	Defective Candy in our chatroom says, Kudos to them for taking the time and trying to launch something solid instead of rushing it like Nintendo.
1162280	1164180	SonicM88 says, Vita doesn't interest me.
1164220	1165381	I've never liked Sony's games.
1167122	1171505	Kitsune says, it may not carry all your favorite games yet, but it definitely has a lot more than 3DS.
1171545	1172606	I'm psyched about the Vita.
1173187	1175448	DungeonBuster says, doesn't really change my opinion either.
1175789	1177290	I have the same opinion that Loki does.
1177490	1178991	I just don't play handhelds all that much.
1179571	1183114	Miklatov says, having played it at E3 this year, it doesn't change my opinion.
1183414	1185096	Just makes me sad I have to wait longer.
1185456	1188398	Need sound shapes, since it's like the Vita's luminous to me.
1189139	1194303	Spazinator says, I'd be interested in the Vita if it'll print money, make me a sandwich, and order me several slutty strippers every night.
1194875	1222257	you might be a little bit disappointed I don't think these slutty strippers will be in right away that could be in the 2.0 firmware though so stay tuned Breakman says it's a smart move for Sony to move the Vita to next year they don't want to compare its sales to the sales of the 3DS which I think will be one of the biggest Christmas gifts interesting theory maybe they did it to not compete with the 3DS maybe they want to hand this Christmas to Nintendo maybe they're a little afraid of the competition
1223119	1226953	is that is does that sound too fanboy motivated or or what
1231582	1246198	I think it really just is a matter of putting out a polished product because especially with the mistakes that Nintendo's made with bringing the system out and not having the right games for it, that's really hurt their sales.
1247800	1251004	So I think that they're really just trying to avoid that trap.
1251044	1252886	They've seen how it's bit Nintendo in the ass.
1254096	1256098	All right, well, let's move over and talk Nintendo then.
1256118	1257880	I was going to move on and talk about the 3DS.
1258820	1263725	With the 3DS, there's some more comments from Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata.
1263765	1265186	Of course, you all know who Iwata is.
1265567	1266628	He's the man at Nintendo.
1268089	1272673	He's talking about the 3DS and talking about kind of the GameCube and how the two relates.
1273634	1279720	He said in an interview that the GameCube suffered because Nintendo did not take opportunities when they were available.
1280621	1287809	The general feeling within the company's management is that the console had a chance to succeed, but that the chance was not taken advantage of.
1288670	1294076	Iwata has said that the company learned its lesson, and that's why they did a price cut so soon after launch.
1295617	1298399	Interesting that they've kind of brought up the comparisons to the GameCube there.
1300860	1303221	Also wanted to mention this with the 3DS price drop.
1303481	1307303	There's some rumors going around that Walmart is going to drop the price early.
1308524	1317708	So if you want to go to Walmart on August 9th, that's the rumor anyway, they are supposedly dropping the suggested retail price down a little early to the $170.
1318788	1323591	What this means is that you might be able to get your cake and eat it too, meaning...
1324091	1341772	if you can buy one of these things in that window between the early price drop and the price drop for everybody else quickly get it on the Nintendo eShop then you will be an early adopter so not only did you get the cheap 3DS but you got the $80 worth of games too so that's one way of working the system
1343013	1345597	So, I guess call your local Walmart or check.
1346017	1346358	Who knows?
1346418	1348320	Nintendo may put the smack down on that, though.
1348400	1349121	I don't know if they can.
1350263	1353367	Loki, I don't know if you know from the retail angle, but could Nintendo stop this?
1353948	1357813	Like, if Walmart wants to cut the price three days early, can Nintendo stop that or no?
1359771	1362632	Here's a couple factors that they have in that.
1362652	1369675	One, whether there is map pricing on it or not, which is the minimum advertised price.
1369895	1378318	So if they have map pricing in place on it, it may prevent them from advertising it lower than a certain amount.
1378859	1381700	Also, if they're being price protected on it, any of those...
1385211	1396389	Any of those units that they sold prior to it dropping in price, they don't get any of the money from when it dropped in price.
1396409	1398312	So they would be eating the cost on that.
1400808	1412958	Now, I wouldn't see Walmart as a company doing this, but I know that, and none of the people I know or work with in the industry do this, but I know there's people out there to do that.
1413398	1425708	You can manipulate your price protection by fudging the numbers, if you will, and saying, oh, I didn't really sell as many units as I did, and then you get the price protection, and then you sold those units, you know.
1427090	1430435	It's kind of ways to work the system, but Walmart's probably too big to do that.
1430715	1432498	I wouldn't think they would be able to do that.
1435780	1436140	I don't know.
1436480	1440883	I don't think that they would be getting any sort of special exception either, but you never know.
1440963	1456472	Well, I mean, I think there's a very small group that this would even really apply to because you're talking about people who won a 3DS, who didn't already buy one, who are really just waiting to seize an opportunity, like it's like couponing or something.
1456492	1459934	You've got the extreme couponer crowd of video gamers out there.
1460194	1464475	I can't buy meat until Wednesday because then it's on sale.
1464615	1465076	Exactly.
1465136	1475059	That's the crowd that this type of thing calls to because that means you have to have $170 burning a hole in your pocket right now saying I'm dropping it on a 3DS because I need to be an early adopter and I know I want a 3DS.
1476059	1497028	so I don't know if that is really a whole lot of people but if it's you start calling places like on or even you know get out in the car and go to some different places on the 9th what Tuesday and I totally lost track of time yes that's Tuesday and go check out you know who might have dropped the price early because you never know and you have until what Thursday night to connect that thing online
1497782	1498423	Rage!
1498463	1498763	Podcast Rage!
1520001	1522162	Man, it's pitchforks and torches.
1522222	1523563	Exactly, that's kind of where I'm at.
1523583	1530167	It's like, hey, wait, I have Zelda Color Game Boy that I got for free, so clearly I had it during E3.
1530187	1533009	It's like, I bought this, like, was it almost day one?
1533509	1534109	Was it day one?
1534189	1536011	I don't even remember when I bought that.
1536171	1539573	Well, you had the Japanese 3DSs, like, heck of early.
1539593	1539893	True.
1541494	1544516	But still, though, I had it almost, like, day one, so...
1546767	1548468	Twinbee, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1570987	1571707	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1591917	1592357	But Twinby!
1606247	1606968	Why this game?
1607508	1611830	It seems interesting that out of all the 3D remakes they could do, we're in Twinbee.
1612571	1615973	You've got to admit, it's not really the first title you think of.
1616233	1623777	I think Twinbee, though, if you look how the levels are laid out, I think Twinbee does make sense from a graphic sense.
1623797	1627099	Because you've got your clouds with all the bells hidden in them.
1627520	1631582	You've got your bottom layer with... So you can actually move your...
1634696	1636156	Same way to Xevious, basically.
1636176	1637497	Yeah, basically the same thing.
1638097	1639877	But I think it would work for the game.
1640117	1640998	I think it would be cute.
1643118	1643398	All right.
1643998	1644358	Interesting.
1645379	1658582	Going back a little bit, since we're a little bit delayed between when we say something and when the live listeners hear it, because of the encoding and everything, Kaijudo in chat says, No, you'll know you're an early adopter because your eShop list will have a section for it like the PlayStation Network store did.
1659102	1659482	Really?
1659782	1661923	But how do we know the non-early adopters don't see that?
1662203	1663523	Because we haven't gotten that far yet.
1664383	1691729	could just be a place that's in the store it's like a heads up or something, who knows Zether in chat says, I hope Twinbee isn't Japan only for the 3DS, it's a good game I would imagine if there's money to be made, why not come out here but of course I don't know, the whole region this is Nintendo we're talking about and the same could be said of the last story, Xenoblade I don't know Zether in chat says, the thing is, Stinger was actually the second Twinbee NES game
1693812	1696353	Who knows what they might do with this 3D remake.
1697393	1698294	I probably won't buy it.
1699094	1699835	No, me neither.
1699975	1701335	There's just too much.
1701415	1707538	Honestly, if I was going to go buy Twinbee, I'd hook up my PC Engine and play my HuCard and play a good version of Twinbee.
1708159	1709299	Not the old NES 3D remake.
1709739	1713741	I'm not saying the NES version is crap, but I could play a good version.
1713841	1715342	I've got multiples.
1716283	1718444	Honestly, what I would do is probably just play Proteus instead.
1719944	1720725	Alright, let's move on.
1720865	1721165	More news.
1721998	1723841	Thank you for watching.
1723961	1724562	See you next time.
1736980	1741444	Of course, they've just expanded the bundle with Steel Storm.
1742365	1747630	And then, of course, the average price is just a little... Well, at the time, it was a little under $5.
1748091	1748932	Now, it's just a little over $5.
1750393	1757880	And I guess Linux purchasers are paying a little bit more at $11.62 is the average there.
1759902	1760283	Of course...
1761564	1761864	DarkSakura.com
1785835	1789558	You can actually get the Humble Indie Bundle 2 as well.
1790158	1793241	So that's another six games thrown in there.
1793301	1808914	Crenn, Physics Deluxe, And Yet It Moves, VVVVV, and then the set two was Braid, Cortex Command, Machinium, I can't pronounce that shit.
1809034	1810315	Why can't I pronounce that shit?
1811502	1812322	Machinarium.
1812682	1813343	Machinarium.
1813463	1814063	Machinarium.
1814183	1814783	Thank you!
1815523	1817784	My mouth just didn't want to form the word.
1818104	1819124	Like, bleh.
1819824	1822265	Your mouth was mushed for Machinarium.
1822505	1822705	Yes.
1823285	1825926	Osmos and Revenge of the Titans.
1827366	1831788	You know it's a weird week at OLR when I'm the one correcting people on pronunciation.
1831868	1832688	Like, what is up?
1834634	1837516	Something is in these fries that DarkSakura made us.
1837536	1838596	Yeah, awesome.
1839737	1840857	Mouth-numbing awesome.
1840917	1845359	I feel like suddenly it's that level in Yoshi's Island where you touch fuzzy and you get dizzy.
1845479	1850442	And all of a sudden it's like Loki's trying to read Machinarium and he's like, Machinarium!
1851943	1852243	DarkSakura.com
1872048	1872648	Anyhow.
1872768	1875210	Made from the tears of Himalayans.
1875730	1880172	Back to the humble indie bundle, which may or may not be available in Himalaya.
1880852	1882753	How long are they selling this for anyways?
1885056	1886518	I think it's only for about another week.
1887859	1893723	It's a limited time, I know that, because I totally missed it last year because, I don't know, I was drunk or something.
1893763	1894584	I just totally missed it.
1895285	1896746	And I meant to get it, and I never did.
1897246	1903892	But this year, you betcha I got it, especially because I'd heard such great things about VVVV and I wanted to try it for myself, and I'm really glad I did.
1904232	1910897	And I'm telling you guys, for as many games as you get with this, if you put in six bucks, you've got to get it.
1911878	1917805	So even if you're like starving student, whatever, at least pay a dollar.
1918205	1924012	Go without a soda today and pay a dollar for just the Humble Indie Bundle 3 games.
1925253	1925974	It's so worth it.
1926915	1929196	And the money, you know, goes to a good cause.
1929236	1931557	It goes to wherever you want it to go to.
1931597	1934258	You can split it between the different companies and so forth.
1934298	1937559	I'm telling you, don't kick yourself later when you miss out on this.
1937899	1939040	And don't be a cheapskate either.
1939080	1942861	If you can afford more than a dollar, then give them ten or whatever.
1942941	1946403	Give them as much as you would pay for an Xbox Live Arcade game or what have you at least.
1946883	1949004	Because I think the games are really worth it.
1949264	1951204	And I'd like to see a humble indie bundle.
1951565	1952025	Part four!
1953345	1954085	So what's that?
1954426	1956327	Only day and a half, it looks like.
1956607	1956987	Better hurry.
1957447	1957888	Day and a half.
1958688	1960309	You can have all the money go to charity if you want.
1960829	1962750	That's the cool thing about it.
1964051	1966753	You better hurry up on that, especially those of you listening to the podcast.
1966813	1972476	If it's after Monday night, you might already be screwed, but you really gotta check that out.
1973596	1980320	Alright, moving on to something less humble, and wouldn't you know it, it's another story about Capcom.
1980580	1980801	Like...
1981761	1982662	Thank you for watching!
1996857	2000700	Capcom is testing the waters in Japan on something.
2001240	2004962	It's a demo of a game called Nazu Waka Yakata.
2005523	2007844	It is an interesting title.
2007904	2009926	It doesn't use buttons on the 3DS.
2010006	2012007	It relies on sound and the microphone.
2012027	2015869	There's like this little trailer that I'm playing in studio for the games.
2015889	2019372	We can kind of look at it here, get the sense of what this game's all about.
2021673	2022074	I guess you...
2026910	2032318	I wonder if this is kind of like Seaman or something where you talk and interact with the on-screen characters.
2032739	2034621	It's kind of the sense I get.
2034702	2035383	It's a ghost.
2035423	2037225	He has no feet and he's a ghost.
2043345	2043865	Mika!
2043885	2044186	Mika!
2044226	2044386	Mika!
2069042	2095910	now granted that's a cheap demo and one could argue that well you're still getting to play at least part of the game but uh doesn't something strike you as really really wrong about the concept of a paid demo especially from a company that's thrived on you know great word of mouth from free demos throughout the years like I don't know Dead Rising like a lot of people decided they wanted that game based off the demo Lost Planet same type of thing right so why now a change in the strategy
2096630	2103888	was this maybe a part of the whole they were going to charge for the Mega Man Legends 3 prototype which was essentially a paid demo
2105287	2106227	Like, what is going on?
2106427	2107768	What do you guys think of paid demos?
2108528	2109048	Is it a rip?
2109068	2109628	Or is it worth it?
2109648	2111348	It depends on how much of the game you're getting.
2111868	2112109	Yeah?
2112509	2117930	Because if it is, like, a really in-depth demo, then, yeah, I can see $254.
2118330	2125952	I mean, keep in mind, we used to get the PlayStation... People used to just basically buy the PlayStation magazine thing for the demo discs.
2126252	2126932	No, that's true.
2127092	2127572	That's true.
2127592	2128252	That's an interesting comparison.
2128272	2130293	And the same was done with the Xbox magazine.
2130313	2131873	The same was done with Dreamcast.
2131893	2132173	Right.
2133134	2135555	Well, it's not the first time they've done this kind of crap.
2135575	2135855	I mean, look at...
2160531	2163673	Dead Rising Case Zero Dead Rising Case Zero
2182580	2185363	I kind of looked at it as DLC that didn't require the game.
2186184	2188066	And that's why I kind of let it slide.
2188126	2195455	It was something extra that wasn't actually in the game that had its own achievements, it had its own ranking, it was its own kind of standalone thing.
2196456	2202403	What if for people who've bought the demo for the game, they get something cool when the actual game comes out?
2204861	2206622	What if that's associated with it?
2206642	2207923	Because we don't have that detail.
2208563	2209084	You know, it's funny.
2209124	2210745	Kind of a similar comment we have in chat.
2211125	2222092	ChalacesPop in our chatroom says, If it was a pre-order bonus disc that came with a cash deposit where I could use that money down against the retail version of the game and I don't buy it, my loss, then I'd be okay with it.
2222512	2225314	But to buy a demo and then buy the retail version for full price?
2225814	2226135	I don't know.
2226175	2228296	I'd just wait for reviews and go straight to the retail.
2229688	2232690	I think they're going to have to work out some sort of perk with that or it's going to fail.
2233650	2237992	They have to give people incentive, especially for such a bizarre looking game.
2239033	2242895	What an interesting way that digital distribution could go, though.
2243075	2254561	Imagine if, and I guess to some extent one could argue you kind of have this already with some things, but what if you could play the first stage of a game by paying two bucks?
2255141	2258603	And then if you like it, you buy the entire game for an extra thirty-eight.
2258723	2261305	Xbox Arcade Game Room Game Room Game Room
2280644	2281785	I think more about Fable 2.
2282285	2283006	I think they did this.
2283046	2287810	I think they chopped up Fable 2 into like six chapters and they put it out as episodes.
2288311	2289712	So they kind of did something like this.
2290292	2293115	But I mean, it was a while after the whole thing had already been released.
2293135	2296138	They just wanted to sell as many freaking copies of that game any way they could.
2296438	2303244	Slice it, dice it, circumcise it, whatever you got to do to sell the game bit by bit, little by little.
2303805	2303985	Yeah.
2304225	2304425	Yeah.
2305166	2305987	Milk that franchise.
2306227	2306787	Exactly.
2307808	2313231	Dungeon Buster says, Wolf3D gave you the first few levels for free, and then if you wanted the whole game, then you paid.
2313351	2314272	You didn't pay up front.
2314332	2315012	Same with Doom.
2315733	2319015	One could argue that you might have paid for Wolfenstein 3.
2319275	2321136	No, I did pay for shareware.
2321596	2322657	We had to buy the shareware discs.
2322677	2324138	Because you used to have to buy the discs.
2325199	2328341	You would go buy the floppies at the store that already had it on there.
2328961	2330162	So, that was fine.
2330662	2333284	But here's the thing, though, about shareware, for the most part...
2333723	2361290	shareware you could enjoy the game as a whole with just the shareware like you would get one campaign of it I guess but you could get the additional campaigns if you had the full like Wolfenstein you play through the whole first campaign but there's four campaigns total with the full version this is a demo this is not you know part of the game this is the demo this is Capcom figuring out ways to be dicks
2362853	2372783	I mean, whether it's locking saves or weird DRM, it's their way of, you know, how can we make more money and fuck people over?
2373163	2374244	Because that's what we do best.
2374365	2375105	Capcom!
2375225	2380190	Well, but this is not the same Capcom from a year ago that started Mega Man Legends in the first place.
2380270	2382813	Is Bobby Kotick running Capcom for some reason?
2382993	2384555	Did he like this all of a sudden?
2385275	2386557	Is he like, uh...
2387372	2391716	Fred Savage where he wears a bunch of different skin suits Did Activision buy Capcom?
2391736	2393477	We just didn't hear Is that what happened?
2395839	2415975	So Alright Anyhow, I guess at the end of the day if you don't like it, don't buy it That's how they'll get the message It's a weird Japanese game that will probably never make it over here so that is easy enough And I'm saying it to the Japanese listeners all three of you Kitsune, IkumaJP, and I think there's one other
2417600	2419761	All three of you, make a stand.
2420281	2423921	Three out of three OLR listeners in Japan reject this game.
2425342	2426222	All right, moving on.
2427582	2429263	Well, how about some news about Harmonix?
2429283	2430863	We haven't really heard from them in a while, have we?
2431043	2431943	I heart Harmonix.
2432003	2432783	What's new with Harmonix?
2432823	2439465	Whatever happened to that... Sorry, I know this isn't what you're reporting on, but whatever happened to that freaking game they were supposed to announce at E3 that kind of disappeared?
2440470	2443611	What you mean, VidRhythm?
2444672	2445412	Yeah, VidRhythm.
2445632	2446612	They didn't say much about it.
2448053	2449173	No real details yet.
2449233	2451654	But anyway, they're happy.
2452254	2456396	They like not being a part of Viacom or any other, you know, com there is.
2457356	2464519	In fact, Tracy Rosenthal Newsome, who is the VP of production, said it's been a terrific opportunity.
2465119	2473142	And I quote, We are very well supported, but really the most important thing is that there's a huge amount of creative energy that has bubbled up during our independence.
2473983	2481286	We've been in development of Dance Central 2, and they're putting small games together, making prototypes, and innovating, so...
2481926	2489491	They are still working on VidRhythm, which there's not too many details, but it's just been described as fun.
2490272	2492554	They're not giving a timeline, but we'll be hearing about it soon.
2492614	2493554	It's fun.
2493774	2497717	Well, VidRhythm is made up of vid and rhythm.
2499739	2500399	And fun.
2501020	2503902	But right now, the focus is on Rock Band DLC.
2506063	2508485	And it's saying that Rock Band 3 still has tons of life left in it.
2510947	2511187	So...
2513277	2518881	We can be expecting, of course, Dance Central 2 on Connect in fall.
2519201	2521783	Any thoughts on possible Rock Band 4 next year?
2522583	2524184	Or do you think, no, it's still too soon to bring?
2524204	2524885	I think it's too soon.
2525165	2525925	You think, really?
2526066	2526206	Yeah.
2530249	2532311	I was randomly thinking about that the other day.
2532512	2539779	Obviously all those games took this year off, except for Dance Central, but the plastic instrument games are taking the year off.
2542241	2544604	They're saying that Guitar Hero is not dead.
2545304	2548007	I think they've said Rock Band's not dead, but they're all taking a break.
2548988	2554933	But I wonder if it's a break until next year or maybe it's going to be a break long enough for the next wave of consoles.
2556715	2557575	That's a good thought.
2557675	2562459	I mean, I think right now it's just they're really trying to avoid that oversaturation.
2563580	2565602	They've got a good product now.
2565722	2568965	They're still selling something without having to develop anything new right now.
2569966	2576211	So as long as it's selling and as long as people keep buying the download packs, then there's no reason for them to make a new one yet.
2577433	2579294	Dan Central 2 is probably going to sell really well.
2580074	2583696	It'll probably stay a huge Kinect seller through the holidays.
2584136	2585937	I think everybody knows it.
2587237	2588298	First one was a quality Kinect.
2588358	2589518	I like Dance Masters.
2590839	2590939	Ew.
2593760	2599982	Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and see what you can get a whole lot sooner than the holidays as in next week.
2600162	2601783	What's coming out next week in America?
2605280	2606000	Not much of anything.
2606020	2609783	Hasn't that been the reaction for the past four weeks?
2609983	2610483	Well, no.
2610503	2611904	Nothing has freaking come out of here but Catherine.
2611924	2617048	There was actually stuff last week, or this week I should say.
2617769	2620150	No, the next week there really is hardly anything.
2620310	2620811	I mean, it's...
2621351	2623353	Here's what we got, and I'll run it down real quick.
2623393	2624735	Wait, can I say this real quick though?
2624815	2630321	It did make the show tonight, but there was a big press release about how Catherine is Atlas' biggest launch seller ever.
2630381	2632143	It's already sold like 200,000 copies.
2632624	2637529	I gotta admit, there is this cynical part of me that's kind of like, you sold that much because there's nothing else to buy right now.
2637589	2639151	There is nothing else.
2641041	2658040	it also helps that you put a woman with large breasts on your yeah that helps too that does help too yeah and all the trailers have been you know her sleeping with a dude it just shows America wants porno games think about it yeah they do um
2659335	2660776	Alright, here's what we got coming out next week.
2660836	2661776	All DS titles.
2662036	2664277	Touch and Play Collection on the Nintendo DS.
2664337	2665317	It's a bunch of casual games.
2665477	2666998	Hurrah!
2667098	2668698	Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
2668758	2670299	It's an adventure game on the DS.
2671899	2673280	And Puzzler World 2.
2673400	2675560	Once again, another collection of casual puzzle games.
2675901	2676501	That is it.
2676701	2676981	Done.
2677101	2679642	Nothing else to report on.
2679862	2681663	Is it because kids are getting ready to go back to school?
2681743	2683063	No, it's just a dead week.
2683303	2683663	I don't know.
2684323	2686044	A week after there's some stuff.
2687865	2688825	It's just, you know...
2690921	2694203	Alright, well let's travel to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates.
2694243	2695944	Let's see if it's a similar story over there.
2696884	2699866	Well, I'll tell you this, on the Xbox 360 this week, nothing.
2700526	2702287	Nothing coming out on the 360 this week.
2703047	2709751	Going over to the PlayStation 3, WWE All-Stars is released this week from THQ, so I guess you have that.
2710991	2715954	Going to the Nintendo systems, seeing if there's anything coming out there.
2718576	2720777	Actually, I have the PSP up first on my list.
2721117	2728938	There's Monhooniki, Poka Poka, Ailu Muraji, and then Uta No, Prince Sama Repeat.
2729738	2731338	Yes, those are the two games coming out.
2731398	2733199	Uta means song or theme.
2733479	2739460	That first one, the Monhooniki, is a farm fish and hunt monsters RPG on the PSP.
2739920	2744741	And then the second one there is, it looks like it's from Broccoli.
2746088	2746909	Uh oh, let me look at it.
2748009	2749030	I thought Broccoli went into business.
2749610	2750531	Nope, they're still there.
2750831	2756194	And it looks like it might be like a... It's a dating sim for girls.
2756274	2757055	It's a pretty boy.
2757395	2758756	Yeah, pretty boy dating sim.
2759016	2761697	Theme of the prints, repeat.
2763358	2764559	Oh, it could be like a redo.
2764599	2767701	If it's called repeat, it could be like a re-release or something like that.
2768473	2775863	Or Special Edition Whatever, I don't think anyone here is going to be importing that Kitsune, Ikuma, JP, any interest in that game?
2777133	2798099	I'm thinking no and that's that's that's it you go to the Wii there's nothing 3DS Super Pokemon Scramble I guess that's kind of a big deal it is a Pokemon game coming out it's not like an official like Pokemon black or white type of Pokemon game but it is a Pokemon related universe game that's probably the biggest release this week unless you want to get like a new pouch for your 3DS with Street Fighter characters on it
2798999	2799480	There you go!
2800421	2803424	Your very busy release date schedule in Japan.
2803824	2804405	How about Europe?
2804925	2805726	There's a few things.
2806407	2811752	Actually, today, well I guess already, Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 came out.
2812393	2817358	On the 10th we have Fruit Ninja Connect and Hysteria Project 2 for PSP and PlayStation 3.
2818199	2820321	And on the 11th we have Edge, and that's it.
2822103	2822363	Meh.
2823578	2826300	Thank God we do have some people in Japan who actually listen to this show.
2826500	2832684	Katsune actually is jumping in saying, Uto no Prince-sama is actually an anime in Japan.
2832944	2834505	So it is an actual anime.
2834525	2836566	Let's see, I'm actually trying to... Opening theme.
2836586	2838547	Yeah, I want to play that.
2838567	2838887	Shoujo.
2838907	2839708	I'll watch it.
2839808	2839888	Ugh.
2853735	2855797	Just watching that trailer gave me a period.
2856218	2856558	Alright.
2858601	2859682	No ice cream for you.
2861144	2861885	Moving on.
2862325	2863687	More gaming news, Loki.
2865008	2867711	That's a very wonderful image.
2868152	2871536	I got a uterus.
2871596	2872337	Let's make a baby.
2875920	2876761	Click it, chirp, chirp.
2897092	2916546	Like a card RPG strategy game or whatever And it kind of looks a little medieval-ish And so Bethesda's saying, hey, that infringes on our own trademark, the Elder Scrolls I don't know if I'd buy that
2917687	2919288	Monopoly on Scrolls
2947469	2949439	Cables, electronics, anything
2951926	2954608	Yes, these people are what we call assholes.
2956169	2957991	Or their lawyers are assholes.
2958311	2964956	I'm sorry, you know, when it's a generic, it would be different if it was like the Elder Cards or something like that.
2965417	2967118	Okay, you got something there, maybe.
2967799	2974504	But, you know, if a word scrolls, which no one owns the trademark to the word scrolls, okay?
2974864	2976405	You have the Elder Scrolls.
2976585	2980308	If it was like the Elder Card Scrolls
2981369	2990816	The Elder Parchments Armageddon That might be a case We're going to file a lawsuit against you so you little indie developer bear do what we want
3009089	3011850	Why do big companies have to be bullies like that?
3012851	3014431	It's kind of a double-edged sword.
3014511	3029098	It's basically they have to protect their intellectual properties but at the same time they kind of overstep their boundaries and try to go after people that really aren't trying to infringe on their intellectual properties and that's what's going on here.
3029558	3036401	It's because the people that make the games aren't necessarily the suits and the lawyers that are actually going after these people.
3036501	3036601	It's
3037621	3039382	and separate entities altogether.
3043184	3043604	Alright.
3045444	3047785	Clearly this will get settled out of court.
3048506	3051567	Which means they're probably going to end up being forced to change the name and then that's it.
3051947	3053108	Which is ridiculous.
3053208	3054789	I hope they kind of stick to their guns and don't do it.
3055369	3056369	Call it Mind Scrolls.
3056949	3058770	There you go.
3059290	3060091	Alright, let's move on.
3060151	3062612	Talk about some Connect news related on the Xbox.
3063252	3067395	Apparently a rating has been spotted for Connect Fun Labs Airband.
3068315	3071337	I guess that is the next Fun Lab that's going to come out.
3071638	3075560	Did you guys know that that whole like be in a talk show thing came out for Fun Labs?
3075620	3076361	I have yet to play it.
3076721	3078022	And I guess Sparkler's out too.
3078582	3080143	Huh?
3080484	3083306	I thought that was Avatar Connect.
3083326	3085168	That's what it's called, Avatar Connect.
3085308	3088371	Yeah, that came out, and then the sparkler thing that they were showing at E3 came out.
3088391	3089271	I haven't played either one.
3089371	3091113	I don't care about either one of those.
3091133	3093555	DarkSakura, at some point, you should take your Kinect out of the box.
3093835	3094456	It'll work a lot better.
3094476	3096257	As soon as someone lends me his Dance Masters.
3097098	3097398	No.
3098399	3099360	He said you were going to lend it to me.
3099400	3101061	You have Kinect Adventures to play.
3101141	3101842	Go rafting.
3101902	3103664	No, I don't want to go rafting.
3105606	3106727	You can do Avatar Connect.
3107267	3109949	You can host your own Oprah show as your avatar.
3112991	3114752	You can do Connect... Okay, okay.
3115212	3116092	Connect Sparkler.
3116212	3118054	It's kind of like having fire in your hands.
3119274	3119995	You don't like fire?
3120055	3120935	I want a para para.
3121576	3123677	It's kind of like if fire was lame.
3127279	3130061	And really, you know, how can you make fire lame?
3130301	3130801	You can't.
3131061	3131501	But yet...
3132904	3135887	Connect Fun Labs manages to make fire lame
3153326	3154406	Oh, I really hope it is.
3154646	3155347	I really hope it is.
3155387	3162188	Because I could relive that scene from Big over and over again, and I will be the life of my own party.
3162288	3163009	Hold on, though.
3163149	3168050	In about another year, wouldn't something like that entertain Josh for like 15 minutes at least?
3168190	3168330	No.
3168810	3169010	No?
3171491	3172611	It's not even a babysitter?
3172891	3173031	No.
3173572	3173752	No?
3173772	3175832	No.
3176252	3178893	Connectimals would entertain him, but, you know...
3180717	3181758	Connect Fun Labs, no.
3182018	3185701	It's just like, hey, look, haha, look at all these indie guys who are doing all these hacks and stuff.
3186002	3187803	We want a piece of that action, you know.
3188104	3189665	Come to Connect, because it's fun.
3189765	3191987	It's whimsical.
3193508	3196971	No, all this shit's gonna be is fucking Wii music, okay?
3197031	3198813	That's all this bullshit.
3200595	3213766	God, even saying the word Wii music just flashes me back to the E3 press conference where Miyamoto comes out playing a fucking fake saxophone thing and how lame that was.
3214126	3216168	It's just like, ah, it burns!
3217629	3218810	It's so terrible.
3218870	3221913	It's like you're suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or something.
3222133	3223194	I'm suing Nintendo.
3223534	3225636	PTSD from their damn conference.
3227756	3228497	XBOX LIVE ARCADE GAME A MONTH
3246134	3251519	We're targeting a frequency of about one a month for Xbox Live Arcade portfolio that will have Kinect integration.
3251919	3254562	That will be really powerful and differentiate the platform.
3254902	3257424	Of course, coming out very soon, Fruit Ninja Kinect.
3257664	3258525	We'll kick things off.
3259366	3262689	Fruit Ninja Kinect, eh, that's stupid, silly fun.
3262949	3269595	But some of the other stuff that they had, you know, like the new Burnout game, just makes me want to cry.
3269675	3270256	It's just, it's...
3272017	3279359	Burnout, a great franchise, great racing game, and we have this top-down thing where I gotta hop up and down to make my car explode.
3281359	3281579	Lame.
3282860	3284820	This isn't Micro Machines, this is fucking Burnout.
3285980	3292642	If I wanted to play Micro Machines, the top-down racing game, from like the 90s, I'd play Micro Machines.
3293842	3294362	Maybe 80s.
3294943	3295883	Might be before the 90s.
3297383	3298303	Freaking John Machida.
3300164	3300984	That's what I'm talking about.
3303224	3303605	All right.
3304065	3306848	Let's move on, I guess, to the classic game of the week.
3306868	3308429	We're just running through the news tonight.
3309770	3311212	It's kind of a slow news week.
3311272	3317438	It's hard to fill a three-hour show when there's not too much going on outside of kids going back to school and so forth.
3317498	3321241	Especially look at what's coming out this week in games.
3321361	3321682	Nothing.
3323354	3325317	So why not go back and revisit a classic?
3325417	3333809	Every week here on the show, DarkSakura takes a step into the vault and finds a classic video game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, study this.
3336191	3337452	DarkSakura, what game did you pick?
3337892	3339373	I picked a really fucked up game.
3339853	3340853	Game series, I should say.
3341333	3342034	Black Matrix.
3343354	3344975	It's actually Black Slash Matrix.
3345275	3346436	Is that like Keanu Reeves?
3347776	3347996	No.
3348917	3351978	It's actually a tactical RPG series.
3353378	3361642	And it's sort of like... It kind of does like a mimicking of Christian religious themes, but it's kind of different.
3361902	3364623	It has heaven, hell, earth, and all the people that live there.
3365183	3372949	and the first one came out in 1998 for the Sega Saturn and it was just so weird.
3373549	3391903	First of all, you play as a different character who belongs to a dominatrix of some sort and then you fight sort of like you've got your move, your attack, your item that's all a turn-based strategy game type of game.
3393103	3397084	I didn't really quite get into it, but it had a very interesting story, I should put it that way.
3397584	3413529	You also had counters, you could defend, you could dodge attacks, you also had a waiting attack, you also had magic commands, you also had different spell effectiveness that changed from turn to turn that was controlled by biorhythms.
3414689	3431579	you had instead of magic points you had blood points and you can distribute your blood points to all the usable characters to use for their spell casting and you get more by attacking defeated enemies so you basically kill them and steal their blood
3433079	3459452	and then you can actually put blood points into weapons to unleash a special attack called its latent ability or you could make it more effective you could add different types of damage that the weapon would deal and then after each battle you get a letter grade rank depending on how well you did and so you get bonus items, money and experience depending on how well you did in battle which I thought was a really cool system
3460032	3471057	So basically, the main character of the first one is named Abel, who is an amnesiac, and he is the main protagonist of Black Matrix.
3471377	3477060	He's basically an angel, and he's locked up in the prison for the crime of love.
3478580	3483625	And, uh, he can change, uh, black wings into white wings and all kinds of different stuff.
3483685	3487389	And then you get your different, um, masters, your dominatrixes.
3487409	3493575	You know, you have Demina, Purika, Michette, Cureshus, and Prob.
3494876	3498019	So, who I always used to just call Plague, but...
3498459	3502980	You also could get a male master named Zero who was available after a code.
3503000	3504201	So you had all kinds of different ones.
3504741	3507201	Then Black Matrix 2 came out.
3508462	3509262	Actually, let me go back.
3509642	3517104	I should actually talk about Black Matrix AD Advanced and then Black Matrix Cross are in the same series.
3517564	3519885	They're the same game pretty much.
3519945	3522566	They just add different elements to the game.
3522606	3523686	So I forgot to mention those.
3524466	3531873	And then we got, okay, Black Matrix 2 came out for the PlayStation 2 on March 28, 2002, and it's set in the Hell Realm.
3532894	3535156	And it's, again, more of the same stuff.
3535276	3541141	You have, instead though, you have your main character, who was like the strongest devil in Hell, and then he got amnesia.
3541362	3541642	Oops.
3542863	3546927	And so, you know, it has, the story actually revolves around that.
3547862	3548783	Black Matrix Zero
3565783	3567484	And that's pretty much it.
3567604	3572688	You really cannot get them in English unless someone has managed to do some kind of patch.
3573888	3578351	And they're really fucked up games.
3578691	3581113	Also, they have great music.
3581193	3581773	I do have to say that.
3581813	3585416	Like, that one right there?
3585916	3587037	That's Zero Zero, isn't it?
3589498	3590499	Yeah, this is First Battle.
3592049	3593090	It's got great music.
3593170	3596012	One thing I did like about these games is it has fantastic music.
3596732	3600694	But it's just the themes are really, really dark.
3600754	3603576	Breakman in chat wants to know who made this game, Cheech or Chong?
3606198	3606858	That wasn't funny.
3608099	3609380	It actually came out by Flight Plan.
3609400	3612281	And it was published by Interchannel.
3612722	3615783	In case anyone actually was curious for a real reason.
3617524	3623245	One of the titles actually did get considered for a North American release.
3623906	3636088	However, because of the religious themes in it, I would actually have to say pretty sacrilegious themes in it, it got the boot.
3636128	3639429	I think we were supposed to get... Could they have just changed the art or something?
3640029	3640469	I don't know.
3641250	3642990	Isn't there other ways they can kind of get around it?
3643723	3644944	They can release anime with that.
3644964	3646645	They should be able to release a video game with that.
3646745	3648726	The Black Matrix just had a pretty interesting story.
3649987	3656031	And, you know, but the first one was really, in my opinion, the best because, you know, you have to work for your dominatrix mistress.
3656051	3658713	And you choose your mistress, by the way, at the beginning of the game.
3660686	3667429	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Black Matrix.
3667509	3669070	That's Black Slash Matrix.
3669650	3671451	And good luck finding that one to play.
3672431	3673872	I have a friend who's got the Saturn version.
3674072	3678173	But think about it, you'll learn Japanese while you play because it's not in English at all.
3678253	3679034	So good luck with that.
3679474	3681695	All right, but a good trip down memory lane nonetheless.
3683135	3685697	One that I'm sure most people listening probably have never heard of.
3685817	3686397	So there you go.
3687165	3689167	Anyhow, that's going to do it for the first half of our show tonight.
3689247	3690008	Don't go anywhere, guys.
3690048	3692730	We still have plenty to go here tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.
3693090	3694431	Some rapid fire news when we get back.
3694451	3696813	We've got to talk about what happened on Blizzard's call this week.
3697434	3700536	Some really interesting updates on Diablo 3 as well as World of Warcraft.
3700997	3703459	Another lawsuit involving Band Hero.
3703959	3707122	And you're never going to believe this story about Skyrim.
3707342	3708883	It actually has nothing to do with the game.
3709484	3710204	Just wait for it.
3710264	3714168	We'll talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
3720936	3723859	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
3723919	3735270	We are live on this Sunday evening, August the 7th, if I look at my calendar right, of 2011, where we're taping the 423rd episode of our show.
3735310	3736591	I'm starting to lose count, oh my gosh.
3737151	3742256	Anyhow, we're going to get back into some rapid fire news tonight and do some quick stories for you guys.
3742296	3742997	Loki, start us off.
3743951	3751418	Alright, so let's see, starting things off, let's talk a little bit about Borderlands 2, which I'm very excited that got announced.
3751438	3760326	That'll be coming out sometime after March 2012, it's gonna be the next fiscal year for Take-Two, and...
3762128	3762928	It's pretty awesome.
3763708	3766389	They had a little bit of a tease in the new Game Informer.
3767269	3770130	Some of the details have kind of leaked out about it so far.
3770550	3773451	One of the new playable characters is going to be Salvador, the dwarf.
3773951	3780213	He is what they call a Gunzerker, basically a guy that's able to dual-wield weapons, which is pretty cool.
3781073	3784774	And, of course, they're saying that there's going to be better AI as well as...
3788497	3793153	The old characters from the first game are going to be NPC characters in this new game.
3795626	3796186	Yeah, it looks awesome.
3796887	3798327	I can't wait to check it out.
3798727	3801929	The first game was just amazing.
3803389	3807351	Of course, DC Universe Online is doing pretty well.
3807491	3814434	Right now, they're going to be merging some servers into mega servers, and this is going to be happening on Monday.
3815675	3818696	That doesn't strike me as news you hear when a game's doing well.
3819157	3819657	Well, whatever.
3820017	3821237	Well is a subjective term.
3821378	3822018	I guess so.
3823651	3828194	Um, apparently, uh, they're previously hailed as super servers.
3828515	3834939	Uh, mega servers will give the players the ability to switch, uh, between PvP and PvE styles of gameplay.
3835979	3836640	And, um...
3838672	3844738	I don't know, I guess the last... Before it was maybe... Oh, hey, apparently we're playing listless tonight, except we're not.
3844798	3845298	Sorry about that.
3846039	3849162	I think maybe before they were... You had to switch actual servers.
3849182	3851524	You had to have a player on each server in order to do that.
3852305	3853226	I'm not sure, but...
3854460	3857302	Right now the servers are set to be merged into four mega servers.
3857722	3864385	One PC, one PS3 server for the US with twin servers in the European regions.
3865306	3867747	So wow, that's interesting.
3867787	3873530	So I guess if you're playing in the US, you'll be playing with everybody in the US.
3873850	3876472	All five other people that are playing DC Universe right now.
3879051	3905144	DC Universe players are going to write angry emails to the show I'm only being half serious I don't know many people at all that are playing it but obviously some people are I don't know anyone that plays EverQuest either but that game is still going although the way things are right now with all the server merges some players will be forced to change their names after the merge since two characters cannot exist with the same name on the same server
3906829	3909857	So now you'll have to be XXXSeparoth69XXX Yeah
3915180	3923926	And then finally, the first PS3 jailbreak raid in South Africa has one man arrested.
3925647	3927688	Didn't even know they were still going after people there.
3929770	3944199	So apparently they raided this guy in Parktown and confiscated $14,000 worth of computers, PS3s, hard drives, jailbreak software, USB kits, and fake PS2 games and original PS3 games.
3946140	3952382	and they said one man was taken into custody at the Special Commercial Crimes Court but made bail.
3955043	3957264	What exactly is the crime that these folks are committing?
3957764	3958844	Jailbreaking the PS3.
3958864	3960645	Yeah, jailbreaking the PS3.
3962580	3981634	which really shouldn't be a crime in the first place well I mean I guess it's a different country but I thought like when it came at least to this country they found in a court of law that you can jailbreak your phone well your phone yeah because that's added to like a list of devices that it's okay and legal to do that with however the Playstation 3 is not one of those devices
3982310	3994795	Now, they were hoping, you know, the whole Geohots thing, that it would actually go to trial, and he would be found, you know, innocent, which case would set a precedent that, you know, it's okay to jailbreak that stuff.
3994835	4006819	Of course, him being a pussy also backed out of everything, and, you know, they settled that, of course, so he can get his job at Sony or whatever, and so there's no precedent set there.
4009284	4011127	I don't think he works at Sony actually.
4011147	4013030	Yeah, he works at Facebook, but who cares?
4013050	4013731	He's still pussy.
4015814	4016435	But you're not mad.
4017437	4018077	Oh, I don't care.
4019418	4021258	There's no reason for me to jailbreak my PS3.
4021299	4023179	Don't play enough games on it.
4023699	4025040	Alright, let me do some quick stories here.
4025120	4026920	One of them has to do with that 3D TV.
4027020	4029141	Remember this announcement at E3 from Sony?
4029581	4030342	Turned a lot of heads.
4030382	4042165	They were going to be selling a 3D TV that came with the TV, obviously, it was like a monitor, glasses, an HDMI cable, and a copy of Resistance 3, and it was all going to be $499, right?
4042726	4045827	Well, it's not really going to come with Resistance 3 anymore.
4046787	4048168	That's changed a little bit.
4048268	4052810	So they've decided now it's going to be Motorstorm Apocalypse instead of Resistance 3.
4053670	4057412	Perhaps they want folks to buy the game separately.
4057492	4058693	Maybe they don't want to be giving it away.
4059073	4064935	Perhaps that Motorstorm Apocalypse didn't sell as well as they'd planned and they are sitting on a ton of them and they need to get rid of them.
4065136	4066776	You also get a free copy of E.T.
4066836	4067977	for the Atari 2600.
4068037	4068677	Go figure.
4069017	4070238	They're just throwing that in there for free.
4070498	4071679	I don't know how Sony got a hold of them.
4072159	4073720	I guess they moved their corporate offices to New Mexico.
4073740	4074241	Don't get me wrong.
4074501	4078503	In Motorstorm Apocalypse, it's sad that it didn't sell as well as they had hoped.
4079344	4080084	It's a great game.
4080365	4084607	It's just, you know, I think people were hoping to get Resistance 3.
4085328	4094254	Although, I'm not sure if it made our show roll, but if you pre-order through GameStop, you still do get Resistance 3 and Motorstorm Apocalypse.
4095558	4101101	But that would require pre-ordering through GameStop And I hate them so much, I'm not going to do that Why would you pre-order a TV through GameStop?
4101201	4122654	Don't do that, do not be tempted by this Amazon will match it, somebody will match it Just wait Anyhow, let's see Apparently there was a statement made to GameSpot That, not GameStop, but GameSpot I want to start a website called GamePots Because apparently there's this
4123314	4126159	Every way, which way you can rearrange that word.
4126740	4130947	Motorstorm Apocalypse, it will have the full screen but split screen functionality.
4131267	4135634	Remember that whole, you know, 3D but one person will see one screen and one will see the other?
4135654	4136375	Yeah, I've played that.
4136395	4137878	That's going to be in Motorstorm Apocalypse.
4138782	4164778	I played with MLB 11, the show, which I really didn't want to play MLB See, they had a demonstration during our little Game of Summit thing I wanted to play Motorstorm But no, the two guys working the booth decided Hey, we're a fan of baseball, we're going to play baseball It's about us, not the consumer So I played that, and it works I don't know
4167130	4167610	Lollipop Chainsaw
4189839	4195412	There's also a partnership now with Katakawa Games that Warner Brothers will have moving forwards.
4195793	4198179	So more cheerleaders fighting more zombies.
4198299	4198840	Hooray!
4200319	4201780	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4220834	4235722	They said, quote, when we first saw and got our hands on the game, we fell in love with it That quote from Square Enix London Studios General Manager Lee Singleton It's a great big bucket of fun I think it's a good idea that they picked it up I don't know why Activision got rid of it
4237623	4239024	But, you know, whatever.
4239764	4242505	Now, you might be wondering, Square Enix and True Crime?
4242685	4243225	What the heck?
4243305	4244926	Does that mean Cloud is coming to the game?
4245086	4245746	No, no, no, no, no.
4245806	4248287	Don't forget, Square Enix now includes Eidos.
4248627	4257270	And this would not be out of the realm of possibility for, you know, that group that brought, what, Deuce X and, you know, some of those other games that now fall under the Square Enix banner.
4257890	4258150	Yeah.
4258210	4258591	There you go.
4259251	4259831	DarkSakura.
4260603	4261624	We have some other stuff.
4263105	4274394	Just Dance 3 is getting a Just Create mode that lets players record their own choreography and challenge online and offline players to fit it.
4274494	4276876	But it's just practice right now.
4278137	4279278	There's a trailer out for it.
4279639	4281720	I'm ambivalent, of course.
4283702	4285824	And then we have very sad news.
4286124	4287545	This makes me sniffle because...
4289026	4299331	The CEO and founder of Game Arts, Takeshi Miyagi, actually died on July 29th.
4299811	4310577	And I've reviewed a number of games that have come out of Game Arts, including Grandia, Sylphid, Lunar, and very sad.
4310657	4315379	He will be succeeded by Ryu Okoriyama, who is a CEO of Gaia Holdings.
4317200	4331870	And last little bit for Rapid Fire is there are pre-order skins available for the new Batman Arkham City game that are going to be related to wherever you happen to pre-order them from and there will be download content.
4332670	4337974	It hasn't said yet though if these are going to be available to everybody maybe through a purchase or whatever.
4338794	4342157	But the different ones that they have is that you can have the 1970s Batman skin which
4346119	4348900	is through shop2.net and Toys R Us.
4349760	4351801	Shop2.net, by the way, is a UK retailer.
4352942	4359404	You can get the Batman Beyond skin through gamestop.co.uk or mightyape.co.nz.
4359444	4361085	That's New Zealand or UK.
4362925	4390935	you also get the Dark Knight Return skin which will be if you buy it at any store if you buy the collector's edition at any store there's the animated series version that is if you get it from Mighty Apes that's again New Zealand there's Earth 1 Batman which is again through Mighty Ape and then there is the Robin Batman which is available through Best Buy or Gamesmania.be which is Holland or JB Hi-Fi for Australia I want the Adam West Batman
4391539	4391899	It's there.
4392319	4392939	It looks pretty cool.
4393159	4393459	I know.
4393519	4394140	Where do I get that?
4394240	4395720	I'll link the picture to the chat room.
4395880	4397620	Yeah, but where do I get that in America?
4398240	4398981	Pre-ordering that from.
4399021	4401061	That one is Toys R Us.
4401881	4402601	Okay, I can do that.
4402861	4404502	Like I said, the 1970s Batman.
4404602	4406662	I don't have burning hatred for Toys R Us, so that'll work.
4408763	4410183	It's actually more like the comic.
4410223	4411423	I can go be a Toys R Us kid.
4411823	4416384	It's more like the 1970s comic version, but that was the same as the Adam West one.
4416444	4417565	Yeah, it's Adam West, Batman and Me.
4418045	4418825	That's the one I want to play.
4419238	4421220	Except, you know, he doesn't have the drawn-on eyebrows.
4421500	4422761	That or animated series.
4422841	4424402	I like the animated series one, too.
4424422	4424923	It's pretty cool.
4424983	4425403	That's in there.
4425663	4427805	I gotta say, that Michael Keaton one's kind of awesome, too.
4428725	4429346	That one way on the right.
4429386	4430327	Is that Michael Keaton, Batman?
4430447	4434190	The one on the far right is actually, I do believe, the Robin Batman.
4434410	4435851	No, that's on the far left, isn't it?
4436191	4437252	No, that's Batman Beyond.
4437893	4438013	Oh.
4438513	4441154	So in order on this one, let me see if I get it right.
4441174	4453759	You have from left to right, you have the Batman Beyond one, you have the Dark Knight Returns, you have Earth 1, 1970s animated series, and Robin's Batman.
4455020	4457601	Just keep in mind, Dick Grayson took over as Batman for a while.
4457821	4464084	You know who they have, or know who one of the characters is going to be that they haven't announced yet, right?
4464164	4466605	Nightwing, actually, is going to be one of the characters.
4467520	4470081	This game is shaping up to be more and more awesome.
4470261	4471962	Well, then let me see something real quick.
4472583	4478746	Well, I just want to say quickly in our chat room, Breakman in the chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com says, Can I get George Clooney nipple Batman?
4479386	4480667	Actually, I was incorrect.
4481347	4483369	Robin gets the Red Robin skin.
4483749	4484429	I was incorrect.
4485850	4486750	It's not the picture of it.
4486770	4487371	It's not available.
4487451	4491353	Red Robin as in the mascot for Wonderful Burger Chain?
4491693	4491753	No.
4491833	4492954	Because that would be hilarious.
4494955	4496976	That's almost as cool as Fighting is the Perfect King.
4498567	4507990	I don't know if I could support George Clooney Nipple Batman being in the game because that means that Mr. Freeze might show up and it might be really bad.
4526104	4550957	Allow me to break the ice Cold Freeze Cold Freeze Cold Frozen Ice Cold Chill Chilling Winter Ice Winter Ice Chill Cold Ice Cool Freeze Chill Freeze Winter Ice Cold Cool Ice Frost Winter Ice Freezing Ice Cool Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Let's
4551786	4552887	Kick some ice!
4580993	4582354	All right, some quick plugs.
4583394	4590598	Check out one of our other shows we produce, The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, www.hordehouse.com.
4590638	4599543	It's all things World of Warcraft, which, funny enough, we're actually getting into a couple Blizzard stories coming up here, but there are things that go beyond just WoW and possibly affecting some other games, too.
4599623	4601384	So a little bit of a crossover tonight going on.
4601804	4602585	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4618483	4622225	We're hoping to talk to some indie developers and spotlight more indie games here on the show.
4622545	4628888	Obviously, we've talked a lot about the Humble Indie Bundle tonight, which is a great place to start, but we want to try and talk to some of the developers themselves.
4628928	4644254	If you or anyone you know is developing an indie game, either for the PC, a homebrew thing, maybe for the iOS or Xbox Live independent games, I know it's very hard to stand out on Xbox Live, that's for sure, so come get some exposure on Orange Lounge Radio.
4644314	4645375	We don't charge for it.
4645475	4647096	I don't think I made that clear last week, but it's...
4647956	4651517	We'll do it because we like your game, not because we're getting any money off it.
4651877	4653017	So email us.
4653557	4660138	You can email the show at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or you can get in contact with us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
4660378	4664119	You can email me directly if you want, rob at orangeloungeradio.com because I'll be producing the new segment.
4664239	4665659	So it'll be fun.
4666779	4667799	All right, moving on.
4667839	4669340	Let's get into some other news.
4669640	4671380	And I mentioned Blizzard a minute ago.
4671880	4675341	There's some big stuff that came out of Blizzard on an earnings call this week, right, Loki?
4675361	4675741	And it's just...
4676741	4680225	Where Blizzard goes, the industry may in fact follow, correct?
4681447	4686513	Yeah, so they announced a few things about Diablo 3.
4688315	4696564	First off, Diablo 3 is going to feature player-to-player real money auction houses for virtual items.
4697405	4707595	So, you're going to be able to play this game, find items or whatever, and then sell them for real money, or I think in-game currency as well.
4708135	4709717	I think you'll be given the option either.
4709857	4711839	And Blizzard will take fixed fees.
4712660	4714581	They didn't say what it is, but they'll be nominal.
4715402	4715562	And...
4718354	4721995	Out of the sale price, both when the auction goes up for sale and when it's sold.
4722975	4738080	And then when an item is sold, players will be able to keep their money in a Battle.net account for spending on Blizzard products and services or cashed out entirely with another percentage-based fee, although not yet announced third-party payment provider.
4740561	4740661	Um...
4743263	4744885	Yeah, that's interesting.
4745986	4752854	Then, if that's not good enough, Diablo 3 is going to require a permanent online connection.
4753535	4754877	That's right.
4755758	4762025	You're not going to be able to play the single player portion of the game unless you are connected to Battle.net.
4765206	4777650	One of the things that they felt was really important was that if you did play offline, you start a character, you get them all the way to level 20 or 30 or 40 or what have you, and then at some point you might decide to venture onto Battle.net.
4777690	4787733	But if you had to start a character from scratch, because there's no way for us to guarantee no cheats were involved, if we let you play on the client and then take the character online.
4788873	4794695	So basically, their whole thing is, if you're connected to Battle.net, there must be no way that you can cheat at all.
4797276	4800259	Well, it certainly would be a lot harder, that's for sure.
4800499	4807205	I mean, exploits will be found in the game one way or another, but this is tricky.
4807325	4811669	Obviously, I have to watch Blizzard very closely because I spend a lot of time playing World of Warcraft.
4811870	4815213	I will buy Diablo 3 because I loved Diablo 2.
4815673	4821759	In some ways, the reason why I like World of Warcraft so much is that it almost plays more like Diablo than it does the RTS Warcraft games.
4823621	4827546	So this is all news that definitely impacts, relevant to my interests as they say.
4829088	4839982	So I think a large part of what they're doing with the online connectivity and the fact that they say you can't cheat or whatever is that they do have huge problems in Diablo 2.
4840663	4853127	with folks cloning items and buying characters that are made in China and so forth by shady ways, getting the characters all leveled up.
4853187	4856249	Cheating, duping is a huge thing, and hacking and so forth.
4856289	4861490	That game has been hacked to shit, and it makes a lot of people not want to play online because the experience is just screwed up.
4861810	4868633	Think about if that becomes a problem, it's going to screw up their entire game because, yeah, okay, we're assuming that
4869233	4876096	They're making the assumption that if it's connected to the Battle.net all the time, that's going to eliminate cheating.
4877776	4879077	I don't think that's possible.
4879297	4881778	I don't think it's going to eliminate cheating, but it's going to cut it way, way, way back.
4881798	4886019	Well, you're going to have a problem, though, with people if they're duplicating items and they're selling them for real money.
4886980	4891582	But they're not going to be able to duplicate items because they're always connected, and the system's going to look out for that shit and ban them instantly.
4891662	4892282	You never know.
4892722	4896203	The real problem is people that buy this shit.
4896523	4902205	Like if you buy gold for these games or you bought one of these characters, you're part of the reason this is happening.
4902605	4903546	And let's be real.
4903566	4907827	And you've probably had your credit card stolen too because a lot of those companies like to do both.
4908587	4911788	They sell you the info and then sell your credit card information to somebody else.
4912229	4913229	But whatever.
4913949	4914909	Makes you happy I guess.
4917110	4917470	I don't know.
4917551	4923113	And then the whole real money auction house thing is just the weirdest thing I've ever heard in my life.
4924034	4931337	At the same time, if people weren't buying this shit somewhere else, they wouldn't have to do something like this, I guess.
4931398	4933098	I think they're just trying to get a slice of it.
4933138	4935199	But here's the weird thing about it for me.
4935780	4937000	Well, A, I'm never gonna use it.
4937301	4940862	I will not use the real money auction house because I don't really want to support it.
4940982	4942903	And A, I don't want to buy this stuff on there.
4943003	4943904	It seems ridiculous.
4944464	4947427	and B, Blizzard's going to charge a listing fee if you sell.
4948107	4951370	Part of me wonders if Blizzard isn't going to profit off false dreams.
4952651	4956534	That they're going to profit off people trying to list all these items for sale that will never sell.
4957274	4960977	I know a lot of people that are saying, yeah, I'll sell items on there and make money.
4961297	4964420	I don't hear anyone say, I'll buy the items off there and make money.
4964440	4966662	Well, here's some other things that you need to consider too.
4968503	4968623	Um...
4973487	4975850	I can guarantee it's not an in-game currency.
4977571	4980514	So that means you're going to have to have your credit card in there somewhere.
4983456	4984517	I mean, that's not a big deal.
5005140	5011542	that let's say hypothetically somebody could sell enough items that they make a significant amount of money on this.
5011562	5018325	I don't think anybody's going to make more than maybe $20 on this stuff, but let's say somebody does make a fair amount of money off some of these items.
5019745	5022826	Wouldn't they have to claim taxes on that at some point?
5022846	5027928	Wouldn't forms have to be filed by Blizzard or I guess whoever their third party is that they're going to get involved on some of that?
5027988	5029648	Can you be taxed on not real items?
5030749	5033990	That's where the whole internet gambling thing comes into play is that
5034750	5043254	There's no... I mean, Blizzard controls the drop rate of these items that they're then going to turn around and charge you to sell.
5043394	5046676	Something about that seems really devious to me.
5047596	5048777	Like, there's not a...
5050017	5058480	Check and balance to that Like Blizzard is gonna control It's insider trading Yeah, that's what it is, it's insider trading Like, that's legal?
5059821	5075907	Okay, I think it's only legal because it hasn't really been done yet But I think this is gonna catch somebody's eye This is gonna catch the eye of a Leland Yee or somebody out there That's wanting, you know, the same way online gambling did It just doesn't add up to me
5078637	5083261	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, this is the same company that got a ton of suckers to pay $20 for a dumb mount.
5083462	5084062	Wow, true.
5084943	5085383	Very true.
5086704	5088186	I never bought the dumb mount, just so you know.
5088206	5089767	The only thing I ever bought were the charity pets.
5090147	5094351	They were charity, just so you know.
5094431	5101137	But I know some people who did buy those mounts, and they quite enjoy them.
5101177	5102138	They spend a lot of money on them.
5103747	5108150	and at the same time, I'm not going to tell a person what they should and shouldn't spend their money on to make them happy, right?
5109171	5113934	And if a fake little star pony that flies makes you happy, then go for it.
5116236	5119998	I wouldn't pay for tower bucks and tiny tower either, but I still play the game.
5120499	5120699	Yeah.
5127639	5133647	DungeonBuster says, I'm surprised that they didn't opt to let players into making a separate profile for off and online play.
5134448	5140735	Me too, but maybe they were worried about things like blurring the lines or whatever and leave it open to abuse.
5141756	5154146	Slaces Pop in chat says, that issue has come up before with Second Life where people were making tangible income for digital goods on their skins, house, digital assets design that they put the time into making and then selling on PayPal.
5154527	5158010	The IRS had no idea what to do with it, but you can look up news articles about it.
5158050	5160312	It was a big deal when Second Life was still relevant.
5161753	5162053	Okay.
5163554	5166475	Yeah, I'm really interested to see where this goes.
5166655	5166955	I don't know.
5166975	5170056	Well, here's my thing, and this is with the whole IRS stuff.
5170537	5177339	If they're going to tax you on in-game currency that you make, then I should be able to pay those taxes with in-game currency.
5177699	5179040	Because that's always been the problem.
5179060	5181841	They're trying to associate a value to this stuff.
5181861	5187443	Say, for example, I sell some items in Diablo 3 and earn...
5190634	5194980	20,000 Blizzard Space Bucks or whatever they're gonna be under there.
5195641	5200428	And then somehow that translates to $15,000 or something like that.
5200669	5202752	But if I never cash that stuff out, I mean...
5203897	5204637	It's digital.
5205037	5207358	It's not really worth that kind of money.
5207478	5211780	I mean, but if they're going to charge me that, then why should I have to pay in real money?
5212240	5214781	If it's not real money, then I'm earning, you know what I mean?
5215862	5218743	Well, keep in mind there are the two completely separate auction houses.
5219203	5222404	And there's going to be the auction house that runs completely off in-game currency.
5222644	5223284	I'll use that.
5223665	5224045	Why not?
5224345	5225125	I use it in WoW.
5225325	5226145	It's a great system.
5226506	5226946	I like it.
5227486	5227746	DarkSakura.com
5243618	5244339	Thank you for watching!
5259534	5260775	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5283596	5285477	That's why you're mad, because you can't cheat.
5285497	5286337	Oh, I'm not mad.
5286617	5289899	I just think that it's a bold statement to say that you can't cheat.
5290299	5291880	There is no can't, okay?
5292060	5292820	It will happen.
5293000	5293941	There will be a way.
5296431	5297912	And then they'll be like, we ban you!
5300214	5306940	You banned me from Diablo!
5308061	5309262	Do people still do that?
5310343	5310883	I hope so.
5310983	5311764	That's my plan.
5312725	5315007	I don't really want to play Diablo 3 with strangers either.
5315087	5316788	I'll be playing co-op with friends.
5317269	5317729	And that's it.
5318870	5321732	Maybe OLR people would count as friends if you wanted to play Diablo 3.
5322333	5323554	We'd go on a co-op mission together.
5324687	5325668	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5346104	5352569	I don't think Blizzard... Diablo isn't really something I'd want to try and play on the go anyway, or somewhere that I can't have an internet connection.
5353089	5355291	You can have internet connections on planes now, you know?
5356211	5356491	I don't know.
5356772	5359534	But not an internet connection to run that game.
5359774	5362716	But I get... I am being a little bit of a hypocrite.
5362816	5363216	I get it.
5363416	5370722	I mean, I admit that, because I'm okay with what Blizzard's doing here, but yet I'm not okay with Ubisoft doing it with Driver.
5370762	5371682	I think it's ridiculous.
5372583	5373083	But...
5374424	5401992	from what I understand the single player of Driver doesn't have any online elements the single player version of this game now does have a real money auction house involved where people could be making money off of it and I guess they've got to protect the environment and heaven forbid somebody does cheat and now this turns into like real money that's when it's going to be a legal problem Blizzard better hope that having everybody connected 24-7 really does keep out the cheaters and they better really be watching that shit like a hawk
5402412	5405915	because if somebody's able to exploit that real money system, it's over.
5406735	5407256	You know what I mean?
5409137	5409337	So.
5411319	5411599	All right.
5412780	5415682	Let's move on to news that came out about the next WoW expansion.
5416443	5418445	So DarkSakura, I know, right?
5418825	5419946	You've been playing this for a while.
5421067	5421607	The rumor.
5423609	5425250	I laugh every time I think about it.
5426161	5434403	The name, apparently, that has been registered for the next expansion verified by MMO Trampion with trademarks and so forth is Mists of Pandaria.
5434503	5434843	Mop.
5436144	5437484	Or the Mop expansion.
5438004	5441145	Pandarias, of course, are named for the Pandaren.
5441765	5448767	Living, breathing, walking, talking panda bears that made their way into WoW culture as part of an April Fool's joke and never left.
5449587	5450988	Yes, you can't get the Pandaren Monk.
5451488	5454649	That's one of the charity pets that actually they sold there.
5456069	5463112	The trademark was apparently registered July 28th, and it could be that this is going to be out in time for BlizzCon.
5463312	5466293	Not the expansion itself, but more news on it will come out at BlizzCon.
5468274	5474496	I guess that the rumors say Pandarins will be a playable race, that you'll get to go to level 90, of course.
5474717	5476077	A monk hero class.
5476877	5478318	As you know, panda bears are all monks.
5479506	5482808	Well, we had some discussion on this in guild chat not too long ago.
5485049	5490653	In fact, I believe that Miklatov was amongst the people because that's who I heard about it from.
5492014	5498998	But we were talking about other possibilities that it could be like the ruins of the Pandaren Empire.
5499478	5504041	That perhaps there's only a few left and you learn to become a monk from one of them.
5504261	5505522	Because we just got new races.
5507359	5512965	So it could just be that you're exploring their culture like they're... Who are the freaking Walrus people again?
5513365	5513966	The Kaluak.
5514246	5515408	Yeah, I like the Walrus people.
5516489	5516869	They're cool.
5516909	5518511	They remind me of Wilford Brimley.
5519492	5521174	No, they all look like Wilford Brimley.
5521454	5521734	Anyway.
5523976	5533762	But, um, I mean, it could be that, you know, you just get to visit the Pandarens and you learn from them so you get a monk class and maybe, like you were saying, level 90.
5535383	5537224	Or, you know, we get more goody items.
5537464	5544289	But, I mean, I would personally like to, you know, have another reason to do five more levels worth of quests.
5544729	5544809	Ugh.
5546132	5550355	My favorite theory about this, though, is that this is just a Facebook or an iOS game.
5550655	5551576	It's a spin-off game.
5551756	5553177	God, I hope that's the case.
5553837	5555398	That would be much more understandable.
5555818	5556178	I don't know.
5557159	5559160	I'm okay with the whole archaeology idea.
5559220	5564344	I call that the archaeology concept, that you're trying to figure out why the Pandarens got, you know, all murdered.
5565104	5568986	I just don't want to see everybody playing a walking, talking panda bear because that's getting a little ridiculous.
5569006	5571567	I really don't think that we're going to get them as a race.
5572087	5583792	Because, I mean, it's like every even-numbered expansion now has, I mean, there's only been four versions, has had a new race added.
5584653	5586894	It was a new area.
5586914	5586994	Yeah.
5587794	5593940	Each one's had a new area open, so I think that this one's just going to be a new area and a new... Because, alright, let me look at it better.
5593960	5595802	Just real quick, Mikulatov's correcting me in chat.
5595822	5597703	The Walrus people are the Tuskar.
5597763	5598224	The Tuskar.
5598284	5600166	I guess the Kalawak is the faction.
5600746	5601447	My bad!
5603684	5610951	Anyway, we got the first one introducing the world and everything, blah, blah, blah, boring, because it was.
5611492	5614955	And then you get the Burning Crusades.
5615055	5617477	You get two new races, one for each side.
5617717	5619539	Demons, demons, and more demons.
5621901	5623163	You get space goats.
5625004	5626346	And pretty blood elves.
5626386	5628608	And you're fighting demons and fire.
5630226	5631306	What was the Burning Legion?
5631486	5632527	And you had to learn to fly.
5632927	5633167	Yeah.
5633587	5636668	The Burning Legion sounds like something you have to take antibiotics for.
5637408	5638028	It's a salve.
5639288	5643469	And okay, the next one you get basically a new character class and a new area.
5644410	5649991	So then when we get Cataclysm, it was against new races and a new area.
5650191	5652612	And the whole world gets fucked up and the game gets made fun.
5652632	5653472	Mm-hmm.
5653772	5661638	So it would logically stand to reason that if they're establishing a pattern, then you'll be getting a new area and a new class.
5662259	5666702	And it could possibly be... Okay, what was the level cap for...
5668661	5669721	Wrath of the Lich King?
5670041	5671082	No, Burning Crusade.
5671582	5671082	70.
5672122	5678463	70.
5672662	5678463	You start off with a 55 character coming from a level 70 cap.
5679463	5685705	So given that the current cap right now is 85, I would think that maybe monks start off as a level 70 or something like that.
5686285	5687985	Actually, you know what else Wrath of the Lich King had?
5688605	5691046	It had lots and lots and tons and tons of ice.
5692586	5693906	Allow me to break the ice.
5694326	5695647	Cold freeze.
5695907	5697127	Cold freeze.
5701592	5703454	It's actually the Lich King.
5705075	5705496	Talking.
5706156	5707177	Arthur's that bitch.
5710460	5711441	I'm going to draw that, you know.
5712442	5712622	What?
5713095	5714116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5734867	5738188	It was some... Well, of course, somebody in our guild said it was all those cookies.
5739428	5740428	That Arthas likes cookies.
5740488	5746370	So I was going to draw a picture of Arthas lounged out like Jabba the Hutt eating cookies.
5746770	5748290	Saying, let's kick some ice.
5749370	5750031	I should do that.
5750971	5751351	Anyway.
5752631	5755112	So Pandaria, yay or nay?
5757603	5759384	I'm all for something new.
5759445	5759885	Whatever.
5760065	5762367	Blizzard's going to do what they're going to do and I can't really control it.
5762487	5766310	Well, Firelands has been kind of burn depressing.
5767403	5779748	Look, they can send us to, you know, they can send us to play with... To the land of P. We can go to Keyboard Cat who lives in the land of P, P, P, P, P. I don't really care.
5779888	5793794	Like, as long as it doesn't have that horribly steep curve into raiding and doing all that stuff that Cataclysm did, as long as it's more accessible, I think as long as it just plays more like Wrath of the Lich King, to be honest, I think it'll be fine.
5794574	5794794	Well...
5797593	5799216	Now that I'm raiding, I really like it.
5799777	5805127	I think that more people, it should definitely, there should be, maybe they'll incorporate easier raids.
5806329	5807671	Like, beginning raids.
5808991	5838164	Miklatov in chat says I don't get all the hate for this being a possible expansion I think it's neat that they are thinking of doing something completely not related to anything currently in the lore of the game makes it the most exciting part to me like I'm with you Miklatov take exactly what you say and I'm with you but then you have to remember we're talking about panda bears that started as an April Fool's joke being that new part of the lore like that's why I'm like do not want
5838884	5839985	I like panda bears.
5840786	5845229	I just don't like them that much or I need them in my warcraft, you know?
5845249	5851854	And maybe the pandarins are actually a magical illusion of panda bears and they really look like, not like space goats.
5853939	5855960	For the record, Space Goats are the best.
5882202	5883563	Let's move on to the email bag, though.
5883603	5890728	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Every week you email us, and we might read them here on air.
5891469	5892730	If DarkSakura's feeling saucy.
5894271	5894731	Or burpy.
5894912	5896473	Hey, I didn't have the mic up.
5897133	5899295	She's going to read some emails for you right now.
5899315	5900075	You better be nice to me.
5900115	5900976	I gave you ice cream.
5901256	5902017	You did give me ice cream.
5902077	5902637	It was delicious.
5902978	5904679	I found Samoa's ice cream.
5904839	5906020	It was really fucking good, y'all.
5906972	5908433	So the first email here.
5909234	5913997	While looking at the disused televisions in the basement, I was inspired to ask again, Jamie.
5914097	5914658	That was to me.
5915218	5917740	Does the Vault have a collection of older television sets as well?
5918380	5918600	No.
5920462	5926406	I'm sure someone has to make adapters to hook up Atari 2600 or Odyssey to HDMI, but do you prefer the original sets?
5927046	5927126	Um...
5928328	5934216	The only way I can really play the Odyssey is to get up to the original sets, but all of our other systems will work with the modern TVs.
5935578	5936820	They make different adapters.
5936860	5939383	You don't have to use the little prongs to make it work.
5939744	5944951	I was going to say, can't you get an RF adapter at Radio Shack that will change it to RC?
5945491	5947012	Yeah, you can get an adapter.
5947052	5959755	Just the one problem is that I think actually since the Odyssey was from, I want to say like 81 or something like that, there's no way to make it work with a newer TV.
5960555	5965336	Also, I think you might expose yourself to some shitty lag if you use the converters.
5965637	5970858	I don't really do this in my house, so I couldn't tell you, but I think you do open yourself up to lag issues.
5971223	5972444	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5991620	5995885	That they were Xbox 360 demo units.
5997026	5998087	We got monitors from them.
5998888	6000950	So that's what we have hooked up with a couple of switch boxes.
6000990	6006616	So we have about eight systems hooked up in the other room.
6006897	6007357	Eight or nine.
6007637	6008198	Something like that.
6008839	6010000	Hooked up to these TVs.
6011949	6017916	I mean, really, to be honest, we have two games on the Odyssey that I really have an interest in playing.
6018317	6019859	So we don't really bother hooking it up.
6020079	6022642	And again, like I said, we don't have anything to hook it up to.
6023243	6024645	All the other ones, no problem.
6024665	6026067	We can hook them up to just about anything.
6026127	6027629	Although I really do think that...
6028489	6032590	Actually, I don't think that we've tried the Atari on an HDTV.
6033310	6037491	I think that last time we played one of our Ataris, we actually did have a CRT.
6038372	6038632	Oh well.
6039372	6043193	It's not like it's that hard to go find a CRT monitor anymore.
6044573	6046394	You know, I can go to the thrift store.
6046634	6047534	Oh look, a TV.
6047614	6048074	Rabbit ears.
6049597	6063566	Also, I apologize for any confusion about last week's email regarding the voices of multiplayer games My use of the term character was somewhat misleading I meant specifically the volumes of online players speaking through their player characters not those of the NPCs Thanks again, Robert M
6065660	6066861	I think we did address that, though.
6068783	6080931	I think we were leaning towards the NPC answer, but I thought I had brought up something that the characters did sound further away, but I can't remember off the top of my head what it was.
6081980	6086603	Keep in mind, a lot of MMOs, you don't really do voice chat through the MMO itself.
6087404	6090886	And those are actually kind of hard to find, the games where that happens.
6091006	6094889	Because, like, yes, you have voice chat in WoW, but nobody uses it.
6095009	6096310	I'm telling you, nobody uses it.
6097430	6098271	I didn't even know it was there.
6099032	6100753	And it's not in the public chat channels anyway.
6102774	6103074	Okay.
6103134	6104075	Ooh, we have one from Silk.
6105854	6106054	Ready?
6107595	6107775	Yes.
6126304	6130467	Anyhow, I started to play this game and even if it is an older game, I really love the story.
6130887	6137012	The options where you can choose how to respond and that it actually has an effect on the story of the game is something that I really enjoy.
6137412	6140834	It makes me want to replay the game and try different things just to see how the story changes.
6141355	6150201	Perhaps I'm also just happy to see some proper blood-sucking vampires instead of the woo me and my curse and stare at you while you're sleeping glittery twats that seem to be ruling the media now.
6150701	6151182	I love her.
6153023	6155685	For the record, the email's titled non-sparkly vampires.
6157170	6163434	Did you ever start playing a game thinking it would be okay, but nothing mind-blowing, but the more you played it, the more you loved it?
6164395	6165155	Guardian Legend?
6166416	6169298	Because when you start playing that game, it's like, oh, I'm shooting shit.
6169358	6170259	Whoa, there's an RPG!
6173734	6181141	Have you ever started a game thinking that it would be okay but nothing mind-blowing, but the more you played it, the more you loved it?
6182662	6187646	Mr. Final Fantasy XIII No, but those games I kind of already had the bar set high.
6187687	6189808	I'm really trying to think of something kind of outside the norm.
6190469	6191450	Let me think on that for a minute.
6193336	6217912	I'm trying to think of any others actually when I got back into WoW yeah I gotta say World of Warcraft actually kind of jumps out at me when I first played WoW I didn't think it was really all that and I didn't think I was going to get that into it but you know when all my friends were playing and it became a lot more of a chat room with fire spells and swords so to speak I think that was actually a game for me when I started questing
6219681	6222324	I guess you could say VVVVV that I played this week.
6222564	6224806	I didn't think I was going to like it as much as I did.
6226167	6229950	Well, I knew I was going to like Portal 2, but I didn't know that I'd like it as much as I did.
6230791	6233413	So, yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of games.
6233973	6236556	But I'm still loving this show and I'm still waiting for my biscuits, Rob.
6238037	6238837	I'll work on that.
6238897	6240239	They're with the tea and crumpets.
6241820	6242180	P.S.
6242320	6244642	If you're an MMO player, you'll love the attached image, I hope.
6244742	6245423	Okay, let's have a look.
6247011	6248672	The Nine Circles of MMO Hell.
6249412	6249752	You know what?
6249792	6253394	I'm actually going to save this and post it on our Tumblr.
6253474	6255315	There you go.
6255776	6258357	OrangeLawnsRadio.tumblr.com Image.
6259137	6260978	I'll do MMO Hell.
6260998	6262699	You can do it after the mailbag segment.
6262959	6265060	I'm just saving the image because I'm going to close the email.
6266561	6268082	So, bite my behind, Rob.
6269282	6269583	You ready?
6270543	6271263	Newsflash!
6271964	6273565	The Tester Season 3 is casting.
6273645	6274265	Info below.
6274365	6275666	I'll be watching, not auditioning.
6275706	6276026	Robaba.
6276764	6283772	Oh yes, I heard about this on Twitter this week and I sent it over to LokiOLR and I was like, Loki, weren't you saying something about you'd like to try a new career?
6283792	6290139	Well, I will link it in the chat room and if any of you make it on there, plug the crap out of us.
6291380	6292741	Actually, I want to say...
6294356	6298522	They were saying that the prize for the winner this season isn't like a testing thing.
6299042	6301305	It's like actually a role in production.
6302066	6305010	So they're kind of up in the ante on prize this year a little bit.
6305030	6306192	Okay, Jamie's trying out.
6306973	6307433	For real?
6307453	6308214	Why not?
6308234	6309356	Oh my God, you should.
6309516	6310097	Oh my God.
6310898	6311458	Sign up now.
6311498	6311839	Why not?
6312796	6315258	Look into it and see if the prize is something you'd actually want.
6315579	6321766	Well, because if they can get me in any level of art production, that says my career right there.
6322466	6327132	I believe the prize is like actual on the production team this time.
6327532	6328814	And it better not be peon.
6329995	6331697	Because I actually have some skills to offer.
6332062	6333903	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6361092	6362753	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6385180	6388581	I just... It's kind of crazy, but I love it.
6388681	6389462	I hope you get on.
6389702	6391002	I actually watched The Tester.
6392583	6395404	Might I go so far as to say I enjoyed the last season of The Tester.
6395424	6403907	I think they could do a little more with it, but... You might also want to watch the show to see... Oh, they give you an option for them not to share your shit.
6403967	6404407	That's good.
6404827	6406868	You have an idea what to expect just saying?
6410971	6413413	Oh man, I can't wait.
6414034	6415335	I hope DarkSakura gets on the show.
6415735	6418798	Of course, that means she won't be on OLR for a few weeks while they're taping the show.
6420199	6421340	Party at Jamie's house.
6422001	6424683	Well, yeah, but I'll be famous and you won't.
6426705	6429167	Wow, you'll get booted off first.
6429367	6430148	No, I won't.
6432129	6433250	It doesn't like my password.
6434491	6435452	All right, let's move on.
6435853	6437354	Do we have any more emails or is it the last one?
6437774	6438495	All right.
6440615	6441516	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6465672	6470715	As Loki predicted, GameStop has decided not to honor the price guarantee thing, which does not surprise me at all.
6470815	6475238	In fact, I'm not even sure I'll be able to get the 80 back from where I purchased it.
6475919	6483784	I bought it at Best Buy, and they didn't know about the price drop or didn't say anything about not honoring their policy when I bought it, but I have this feeling that it won't work.
6483884	6488106	Either way, in my mind, it's totally worth it just for the GBA titles alone.
6488587	6490408	I really miss the Game Boy as a platform.
6490928	6495591	I never really got into the DS like I did with the Game Boy and ended up selling the one I had three years ago.
6496492	6499154	So I've been out of the DS world for three years.
6499634	6500474	That's where you come in.
6500875	6508460	I'd like to keep my DS for more than just retro GBA titles I bought it for, so I would like to hear some of your favorite DS games that might suit my interests.
6508980	6513563	What do you recommend as games that appeal to everyone and what specific titles would interest someone like me?
6514143	6515824	I'm not a fan of RPGs anymore.
6515884	6516325	Oh, hang up.
6516365	6516705	No, I'm kidding.
6517245	6518666	Since I don't have the time to play them.
6519206	6521348	I'm more into shooters, arcade games, and platformers.
6521388	6524249	I plan on getting Geometry Wars Galaxies, a Castlevania title.
6524289	6524930	Which one is best?
6525370	6526150	Oh, what was that one?
6526511	6527831	Order of Ecclesia was really good.
6529032	6532375	Um, Retro Game Challenge, WarioWare Touch, Trauma Center 2.
6533175	6536938	I picked up Ocarina of Time, obviously, and Plants vs. Zombies download version so far.
6537298	6540601	Oh, Mario Kart DS is my favorite DS game from when I owned one before.
6541482	6544244	Um, I like, I got Puyo Pop, I mean Puyo Puyo.
6544984	6548347	I've got Osutatakai Oendan, um, or you could get Elite Beat Agents.
6548547	6550088	I actually really prefer the Japanese one.
6551029	6553450	Um, what else is in my thing?
6553551	6557193	Oh, yeah, um, what was that Professor Hatsworth game?
6557313	6558074	Professor Layton?
6558374	6559514	No, it was Hatsworth.
6561355	6565357	It's like a combination puzzle game and investigation game.
6565757	6566637	It's really interesting.
6566757	6568538	Yeah, I kind of know what you're talking about, yeah.
6568618	6569458	That game was pretty fun.
6569478	6570579	I don't know.
6570719	6571179	What else, Rob?
6572179	6573380	He named a lot of them.
6573440	6575861	I mean, gosh, you got a whole full plate there.
6576161	6578522	Retro Game Challenge was one of the ones that came to my mind, too.
6580943	6583564	Really good games on DS.
6584024	6586925	I need more time to think.
6588159	6589940	I should just go grab my DS case and see what's in it.
6590140	6590701	I know, right?
6590781	6593102	I'm like, I can't see my DS collection right in front of me.
6593923	6596825	A lot of people are really into the Pokemon games.
6596845	6597866	I play a lot of Cooking Mama.
6599507	6602990	Since he's talking about Trauma Center, Cooking Mama's like that with food.
6603971	6604831	So it's really fun.
6604972	6606753	And don't worry, Mama will fix it.
6607614	6610196	I liked the Kirby game where you draw the lines.
6611196	6611737	Oh, um...
6613131	6614392	and Kirby's... Epic Yarn.
6614892	6616152	No, no, that was the Wii game.
6617593	6620374	It was a different Kirby game where you would draw all the lines and stuff.
6620414	6621175	I don't remember.
6621195	6622975	You're making me think.
6623876	6624876	What am I, a talk show host?
6626437	6629618	Some of the old school, like even the Mario 64 port is actually really good too.
6630238	6632499	Oh, Elite Beat Agents says Dungeon Buster and Chat.
6632539	6633320	Well, I said that.
6633480	6637462	So I said Oendan, but I said you can get it as Elite Beat Agents, although I prefer Oendan.
6637482	6638182	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
6641224	6642205	Oh, there's Ragnarok.
6643085	6645247	That's RPG though.
6646167	6646768	I liked it though.
6646868	6648529	Breakman Civilization Revolution.
6648589	6649450	I really liked that game.
6649950	6652372	But I liked it on the consoles.
6652452	6654394	I don't know how well I should get my DS custom look.
6655694	6657496	Then again, I've got like a box of games.
6657696	6660098	So I'll lend you one.
6660538	6662880	Maybe I'll sell you some of them.
6664031	6692155	I might not be listening live because of work early in the morning I'm on the east coast so if the chat has any good recommendations too I would love to hear those in the podcast which we just did oh he said he's not into RPGs but the Final Fantasy 4 remake is so fucking good like you might want to think about going back to RPGs for that keep up the great work with the podcast it's still my favorite out there by a long shot thanks guys SonicM88 oh and by the way I am playing Final Fantasy 3 and it's pretty good on the game see there you go
6694472	6695013	Oh, great.
6696254	6697214	My profile's made.
6698335	6699636	Oh, I love what Zether says here.
6699716	6700777	Meteos is awesome.
6701758	6702959	Meteos was an amazing DS game.
6702979	6703899	Electroplankton was kind of fun.
6704600	6705921	That was a great DS game.
6707442	6708343	All right, is that it for emails?
6708863	6709144	Yeah.
6709404	6710805	And by the way, I've got a profile now.
6711125	6713607	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6713627	6715729	I ain't got a picture, but I'll link it in the chat room.
6715769	6716810	You should put a picture.
6716850	6719492	You need to start filling it out with why you need to be on the tester.
6720272	6721293	I will, but I'm linking it already.
6721333	6722094	I need a job.
6724551	6732517	you have to talk about how much you love Sony and how you've been a gaming girl all your life I bet you'll get on I bet you will
6735000	6735620	Alright, anyhow.
6736141	6736681	Moving on.
6736801	6738242	We got some more news stories for you guys.
6738322	6739303	Oh, we got the FUs of the week.
6739683	6740283	We gotta do those.
6740684	6749129	As much fun as I would like to join the tester, I would hate to have to move to LA to be a game tester.
6750050	6753932	Yeah, you do know you have to move to Santa Monica to be a game, to do the production, right?
6754612	6755053	She doesn't care.
6755073	6755753	I don't care.
6757074	6758055	She'll be closer to Disneyland.
6758755	6759936	We'll be closer to Disneyland.
6760757	6766341	But see, the problem is though, it's a judging panel that decides whether... Or is it challenges?
6766461	6766721	I don't know.
6766761	6767582	I've never watched the show.
6768823	6771725	It's weird challenges that sometimes have nothing to do with games.
6771745	6778510	Yeah, it's like we challenge you to like, you know... It's not like... See, because when I first heard about the tester, I was thinking it's that...
6779751	6788800	I own more than 40 different video game systems and have decades of experience I'm also a graphic designer with a focus on video games and an experience in 3D design and Maya I could use a job!
6808547	6809068	How's that sound?
6809468	6830810	You should give a shout out to the podcast too Just for when you uh Just for, you know When I am on I'll do it in my video Oh my god, I gotta do a video I better be super cute Better get your hair did I need to get my hair did, my nails did
6831678	6833320	They're still naming DS games in the chat.
6833940	6834761	Zether says Contra 4.
6834801	6836883	That was pretty good.
6837584	6842028	Breakman in chat says, Loki couldn't do the tester because Loki doesn't take orders.
6842128	6843029	Loki gives orders.
6843609	6844170	Mwahaha.
6845311	6846332	There you go.
6847773	6848714	What are you looking at there?
6848734	6850575	Are you doing a Tiny Tower cheat?
6850696	6851396	Is that what's happening?
6852998	6856841	Did you cheat and you have 6 million gold in Tiny Tower, you damn cheater?
6856881	6857382	What the crap?
6858160	6858860	I am a cheater.
6858880	6860241	You are a damn dirty cheater.
6860261	6860621	How did you do it?
6860741	6861621	No, I'm not cheating.
6861701	6862101	I don't want to know.
6862121	6863281	I have a jailbroken device.
6863301	6864842	I can do whatever the fuck I want.
6866402	6867642	And it's completely legal.
6867902	6872884	You're a lying, cheating sack of shit.
6873004	6876224	That's why you're not going to be a fucking game tester.
6877405	6878905	Because you can't play by the rules.
6878945	6879385	Bullshit.
6879545	6880805	I could be an awesome tester.
6880865	6881326	You know what?
6881406	6882926	In fact, there was a thing that I saw.
6883286	6884787	My picture, and it's cute.
6884867	6885547	Alright, there you go.
6885768	6887249	There's a... I mean, shit.
6887429	6892592	I've played so much Grand Theft Auto, I could easily be a tester for their goddamn multiplayer stuff.
6892992	6897255	I know the ins and outs of all of their Grand Theft Auto games, including the PSP.
6897555	6899416	I know shit that they probably don't even know.
6900417	6905580	But then, again, I don't want to compete on a show where I have to compare images to see what's different.
6905840	6907701	If I wanted to do that, I'd buy a DS. ...
6911986	6917074	Alright, Breakman says when you apply for the job, DarkSakura, just tell them you know the Bobby Blackwolf.
6917094	6918075	You'll be hired on right away.
6918315	6918736	That's true.
6918816	6921300	After all, he is a trending topic in Sacramento this evening.
6921640	6921861	Yep.
6924665	6926648	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
6942983	6947595	Um, my FU of the week goes to me not having a copy of Black Matrix.
6948978	6950061	I found it on eBay.
6950101	6951184	No one will buy it for me.
6951244	6951665	Boo hoo.
6953531	6968343	My FU of the week goes to Loki for cheating on Tiny Tower and I hope his tower, because it's so cheaply made, I hope that the material that his Tiny Tower was made out of just collapses on itself and the whole building just implodes.
6969043	6970865	Have the blood of his bitizens on his hands.
6971085	6974667	Exactly, and you'll have the blood of all those bitizens on your hands.
6975408	6979011	Otherwise, I give an FU to tacos for being so delicious and making me fat.
6980172	6980412	Loki.
6982393	7006072	I guess my F you would go to the tester because if I were to win the tester I'd end up working at Sony and I'd look at the sheet of things that they want me to test I'm sorry, I'm supposed to test to see if this game doesn't suck I don't know, I got nothing I'm not really mad at anything
7008371	7011393	It was surprisingly easy to do with the jailbroken device.
7013314	7014015	I might add.
7015335	7017417	Download a file, copy it over, done.
7017817	7019238	And it didn't even erase my progress.
7019318	7020799	It just added six million money.
7021179	7024801	All right, so I see that DarkSakura has a profile.
7024861	7025922	Like, how do I vote for you?
7026062	7028143	Oh, there's a big clock in the corner.
7028243	7030285	Voting begins in 16 days.
7030345	7032246	Like, I can't actually vote for you yet, I guess.
7034420	7034820	DarkSakura.com
7060462	7080863	I've added a second picture of what my hair looks like curly You know, it just occurred to me Derek H, I think on Dead Pixel Live last year had the casting dude for the tester on his show You need to talk to Derek and get dude's email address and just be like, yo, cast me That's what you need to do You need to just bypass this whole system right here
7083704	7085065	Go directly to show.
7085565	7086505	Do not pass go.
7087366	7088847	We should all be on the test.
7088987	7090067	No, we're not all going on.
7090287	7091868	I'm not going on that goddamn show.
7091948	7093309	Come on, it'd be hilarious.
7093369	7100072	If I go on the show, it is to be a judge because I would enjoy nothing more than the judge, the two of you sitting up there getting ready for elimination.
7100132	7102613	I think that guy doesn't know shit about testing games.
7103594	7106295	He wasn't even a trending topic in Sacramento.
7107793	7110354	Well, Loki, you're a goddamn cheater at all your video games.
7110394	7111895	Explain why you should be on the tester.
7112095	7116217	Because I know where to find the information that you're looking for.
7116478	7122361	I know to find all the exploits and backdoors for your games and how to get around this stuff.
7122701	7125242	If you don't fix this shit, other people are going to do it.
7125602	7127723	DarkSakura, your Kinect is still in a box.
7127803	7129264	Why should you be the tester?
7130045	7131465	Because my Kinect's in the box.
7131706	7133807	My move is fucking on the TV.
7134087	7136188	That is why I need to be a fucking tester.
7138217	7144038	Because we have a goddamn Gran Turismo setup built in our house where we can play in a fucking race car.
7144218	7145399	Is your name DarkSakura?
7145419	7145939	That's funny.
7145959	7147359	You don't sound like DarkSakura.
7148739	7152020	Well, because we have a $400 rig setup to play Gran Turismo 5.
7154981	7160982	And that we've built seats to play the setup out of the seats from a Honda Prelude.
7161342	7161842	Two of them.
7162862	7165543	I have every Sony system ever made.
7165563	7166663	Okay, here...
7167970	7173637	This is fine radio and all, but there's a part of me that is legit worried you're actually going to get on this show.
7174218	7176100	I have legitimate concerns.
7176141	7178203	If I get a job out of this, fuck yeah.
7178564	7180887	But this could also end up very bad.
7180967	7182529	You could end up being the bitch.
7183049	7185352	I've seen you go without eating for some time.
7187293	7197757	It is not going to be pretty if you have to do something Yes, Rob knows what low blood sugar Jamie is like And you might have to do something that you don't like on this program And I am very worried I should sign up too, it would be hilarious Like what?
7197837	7200178	Play Imagine Babies?
7200358	7215463	Okay, one last season they had some fucking challenge where they were out there doing army stuff Okay, I know, I know what will piss you off Working together as a team with people who are idiots That is going to piss you off beyond belief See, you're already fretting
7215763	7220326	No, I will tell you this, because I worked with idiots at my job and I hid it very well.
7222347	7224149	I know how to be a team fucking player.
7226390	7226891	I am good.
7227011	7227131	Really?
7227151	7228532	Can you teach Loki a thing or two?
7229852	7230033	No.
7230373	7231534	I am my own team.
7232314	7234476	No, because his team is the voices in his head.
7235917	7238198	I can take a picture of the vault.
7239850	7240730	and show it to them.
7241531	7244412	This is why you need to have me because I've played all this shit.
7244492	7250654	Legitimate concern that you actually may make a case for yourself to be on this show and you will actually be on this program.
7250674	7251414	Look at this face.
7252235	7253315	Look at this adorable face.
7253355	7254215	I try not to.
7254956	7255316	Shut up.
7255636	7256496	I gave you ice cream.
7256516	7256876	Look at me.
7258297	7258737	I'm looking.
7259597	7260278	I'm serious.
7261338	7262418	I am for real serious.
7262599	7263579	I want to be on the tester.
7264807	7268428	You do realize this is for a minimum wage job in Santa Monica, right?
7268488	7269328	It could be.
7269428	7272389	But know that Annie's up this season.
7272449	7273970	It's a production job this year.
7274190	7276010	Which means that I would be... A production job?
7276171	7276931	So what's that mean?
7276951	7277911	I'll put it this way.
7278031	7290475	Production is like... For a graphic designer, production would be like color editing, color correction, adjusting textures, that type of thing.
7290575	7291915	Here's a bunch of spindles of discs.
7292015	7292936	Here's a bunch of cases.
7293016	7295176	We need you to produce the finished product.
7295436	7295616	No.
7295976	7296716	That's not how it works.
7297417	7301397	Anyone that's in production is in the actual building part of the game.
7301557	7303438	You may be crunching numbers or doing some data entry.
7304438	7308359	It would be something that's the equivalent of the job that I was just fucking doing.
7309239	7311380	Except I actually have skills to bring to the table.
7311500	7313000	They could put me to work in art production.
7313880	7314460	And guess what?
7314680	7317701	I would be good at it because that's what I'm trying to do with my life.
7318865	7319266	You know what?
7320408	7323433	If I sign up for the tester, I'm going to do it in my costume.
7325339	7327440	Why are you people trying out for the tester?
7327660	7329380	You used to make fun of this show two years ago.
7329400	7330101	It's the whole point.
7330121	7330901	Don't you understand?
7330921	7331821	Because I need a job.
7332841	7333742	Don't you understand?
7333782	7334502	That's the whole point.
7334522	7335882	That's the funniest part about it.
7336463	7343485	What better way to get back at something that you hate than to be part of it and then be a complete asshole on it?
7343985	7344905	It would be awesome.
7345005	7346126	Rob, for real though.
7346246	7347146	I don't want to win.
7347506	7349147	I just want to be on the show.
7350583	7351804	And see, I want a job.
7352805	7353625	Thank you, Frisbee.

7361431	7361991	Hire me.
7362852	7372178	Because honestly though, because I was thinking about it, I would, if the job equivalency is what I'm thinking of, I would be making about what I made at my old job.
7372238	7374180	Will you be able to tighten up the graphics on level three?
7375621	7375981	I could try.
7376814	7377735	No, hold on, hold on.
7377755	7379876	I want to just show DarkSakura this real quick here.
7380296	7381737	DarkSakura, I just want to show you this.
7381777	7383297	I mean, look at all those douchebags.
7383338	7386419	You really are going to have to team play with them.
7386459	7389681	You do know that, right?
7405103	7412371	Well, see, as Rob, as the one of superior intellect, I would actually manipulate them into failure.
7413051	7414273	Pick one of the contestants.
7414533	7417256	Congratulations, 8-Bit Mickey.
7417336	7421040	These 12 gamers will be living together in PlayStation Paradise.
7421200	7424263	I am one with the video games.
7424484	7426285	I want to hurt him so bad.
7427745	7431409	I just have to murder these people.
7431449	7433411	They had to do a dancing competition.
7433472	7435774	Are you going to do a dancing competition, DarkSakura?
7435814	7437977	I got rhythm.
7438037	7439098	I'll do all para para.
7439358	7440880	She didn't even miss a beat in saying that.
7440940	7441441	I got rhythm.
7443062	7451424	Dude, have you seen... Now, this is hilarious because Joystick decided that they made casting videos for each one of the people on their staff.
7451504	7451805	Nice.
7452465	7452925	Well played.
7452945	7454285	They have some really funny ones.
7454365	7454905	Well played.
7455366	7456146	No, seriously, Rob.
7456246	7456986	I'll do Parapara.
7458066	7458426	Alright.
7458807	7459847	It's fine.
7460947	7461867	I hope you get the job.
7462088	7463648	I legit hope you get the job.
7463668	7466269	We'll bring the video camera and show off my bemani.
7467549	7470571	and all this other quality PlayStation shit I have.
7471252	7480898	I mean, quality PlayStation products that I've spent my good hard-earned money on and my first generation PlayStation 3 so I can say, look, Linux!
7481618	7484240	I mean, look at PlayStation 1 games.
7485441	7489323	Zether is linking me to a YouTube saying this was a tester contestant.
7489383	7490504	I can't wait to see this here.
7490564	7490944	Let's see.
7491164	7495087	Watch out, they're coming through the window Watch out, they're coming through the window
7500442	7501242	Is that Rebecca Black?
7503903	7505884	Sure, yes, it's Rebecca Black, DarkSakura.
7507665	7508185	All grown up.
7509806	7512206	I just want to say, if you go on the show, that's going to be you.
7512547	7514267	Can we get a hey there coming through the window?
7514707	7515528	Come on, DarkSakura.
7515928	7516528	Bite my ass.
7518869	7519789	You're not a team player.
7519849	7521370	You lied when you said you were a team player.
7523897	7526759	Alright, Loki, let's move on with some actual gaming news.
7528780	7537584	Maroon 5 has decided to join in the lawsuits against Activision over Guitar Hero.
7537604	7538625	In this case, it's Band Hero.
7539145	7545709	He is suing because Activision improbably uses likeness in Band Hero and...
7546297	7547858	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7565359	7578163	It was great because he said he did the motion capture to have his avatar used in the Band Hero song, She Will Be Loved, but didn't give Activision permission to use his likeness with other songs, which it totally did.
7578743	7580584	Deja vu from like a year ago.
7580604	7585485	Levine alleges Activision asked other artists for expanded use of their avatars and paid them more for the process.
7588946	7591007	Wow, it's last year all over again.
7591887	7592187	Really?
7592207	7593908	Yeah.
7595103	7597544	And of course, you know, the same thing happened with, you know, No Doubt.
7597684	7600064	Do you think they just want a piece of the money as well?
7600665	7602945	I guess that's really what it's got to do with, huh?
7603305	7604045	I don't care.
7604386	7605406	I don't even care.
7605506	7607426	I mean, because boo fucking hoo.
7607486	7608347	Get over it.
7608447	7609287	I mean, seriously.
7609587	7609927	Oh, no.
7610007	7613188	You're in a game singing other people's songs in their voice.
7615946	7616987	It's an avatar.
7617127	7617888	Who cares?
7618109	7625318	No one made you like... No one drugged you up and made you sing those songs on stage for like a live concert or something like that.
7625498	7626540	It's a digital...
7627406	7630267	Character, not really you.
7631627	7634248	I mean, they don't steal your soul and put it into the game.
7634568	7637049	I mean, unless you may think that's how it works.
7637869	7639269	It's not really you.
7639349	7641230	My art is my soul.
7641450	7645411	And when I sing a Miley Cyrus song in these games, that's raping my art.
7648891	7675634	well here's the problem I didn't want to hear anything about Miley Cyrus and rape you put your songs into Band Hero Band Hero which is the poppy version of Guitar Hero you should have really put your stuff in the Guitar Hero not Band Hero or Rock Band alright I don't know what to make of this next story let's see what you guys think of it let's see
7677423	7690632	Pete Hines from Bethesda Softworks figured that February 18th would be the perfect day to conceive a child, as the baby would be due on November 11th, which would be the ship date for the Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.
7692173	7695996	There's another couple, though, that has conceived a little bit earlier than that.
7696996	7697337	Let's see.
7697497	7703681	Atari Lin, I guess, is the child, decided to come out of...
7705382	7715047	The mom's womb as mom and dad sat down for the half-hour demo of the Bethesda Skyrim demo at QuakeCon.
7716088	7723311	The father talked to Game Informer that I guess the sight of the Frost Dragon on the screen sent mom into labor.
7725652	7731735	The couple hung around rather than dashing for the hospital because they thought it might be false labor.
7732356	7734777	And she loves Skyrim.
7737461	7739482	They named the baby apparently Atari Lynn.
7743603	7744144	Dorks.
7744764	7746945	You know, they are one letter away from Atari Lynx.
7747605	7749326	They made a baby.
7751186	7753267	And they went into labor.
7753727	7755208	But they didn't go to hospital right away.
7755228	7757349	So the baby drowned at the thing?
7757509	7759930	Well, they didn't want to miss the demo, DarkSakura.
7759950	7763031	This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see Skyrim.
7763513	7763894	DarkSakura.com
7777179	7782984	Apparently, Kotaku, who first broke this story, so to speak, was actually contacted by the mother.
7783524	7789369	They're saying that she's actually still in labor and reading the comments, but I guess they are still naming the baby Atari.
7790049	7793772	The name Atari comes from the name Ataru, which means to hit a target.
7794593	7798216	Right, yeah, that's what they named the baby after, is to hit a target.
7799699	7800960	Ataru hit a target.
7801201	7802722	This baby's gonna be a bullet.
7802903	7803964	It's gonna hit a target.
7804084	7809550	Not naming it after a game system that these geeks obviously named their kid after.
7809690	7815236	They also do say, we assume by the time she's in high school, most of the children her age are not gonna know what an Atari is.
7817098	7817999	No, that's not true.
7818880	7819501	They should know.
7821563	7821703	That...
7823730	7827511	Man, you know, it's just like, can you imagine when the kid wants to know someday?
7827592	7829192	Like, you know, tell me the story.
7829252	7830773	That is so retarded.
7831553	7832213	I mean, seriously.
7832673	7834474	Oh, they're not going to know what an Atari is.
7834694	7834954	Really?
7835194	7837795	Because children don't learn history?
7838576	7839256	Oh my god.
7839696	7841877	What is, you know, the 13 colonies?
7842097	7844978	I don't even know because I wasn't alive then.
7845018	7848539	Well, okay, name five movie stars from the 1940s.
7848559	7848599	Go.
7852776	7853377	See?
7853597	7853857	See?
7853897	7856338	You couldn't do it, so maybe they can't do it.
7856418	7856859	I don't know.
7857659	7859020	Maybe that's the thought behind it.
7860161	7863443	Uh, Fay Wray?
7864183	7866124	Alright, let's... She's in the 30s.
7866204	7866484	Shit!
7866584	7867805	Ernest Borgnine?
7867845	7868466	He's old enough.
7872034	7872774	Thanks for watching!
7888963	7894307	So, here's the interesting comment, though, from Skyrim director Todd Howard.
7894327	7896708	It's speaking to PSM3, one of the magazines there.
7897589	7902032	I do think industry-wide we would benefit from more games out at $19 or $29.
7902532	7906554	I would try more games because I'm not going to try a game for $60.
7907435	7908456	It's a tough decision.
7908976	7913459	But then they went on to say that, yes, the $60 price point is still what Skyrim is going to be at.
7913499	7918062	So, there should be more games at $19 and $29, but Skyrim is still $60, just so you know.
7919235	7923417	I hate to say it, okay, all joking aside, the irony aside, he kind of does have a point, though.
7923917	7929299	If games overall were kind of cheaper, it wouldn't feel like such a loss to try a game at $19 or $20.
7929560	7931681	I think the fact of the matter is most games aren't worth $60.
7933181	7937543	300 hours out of a game, I mean, that's unheard of in most cases.
7937743	7941365	If only there were a way to try games before you bought them.
7942585	7943246	We could call it...
7944586	7949009	or Rentine or Demos.
7951190	7964779	If only such things existed in modern society, but us being so barbaric have not had the foresight to create such wonderful implementations of trials.
7965019	7965139	Mm-hmm.
7966946	7968289	But yes, you're right.
7968329	7972498	We should tell the studios that spend millions of dollars in production to, hey, you know what?
7972538	7976026	You need to put your game out for two bucks because no one's really going to buy it unless it's two bucks.
7979676	7982797	DarkSakura, I know you're working on your application, but do you have time for another story for us?
8008832	8037809	I sure do well you know they just had the EVO tournament well they're going to have to relearn all their characters all over again at least for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition a patch is coming out that will rebalance the game so right now it's really imbalanced so they're hoping to fix it it's going to be version 2012 and they did announce that at EVO Yoshinori Ono actually said that they've been location testing the version in Japan
8040103	8040383	So there.
8041303	8042104	You don't have to buy it again.
8042204	8043764	You just have to download the patch.
8045025	8051487	Well, that's good that it's just a patch this time and yet not another way to milk more money out of the same damn game as they've been doing for the past three years.
8052027	8052668	I know, right?
8054729	8055069	That's it.
8055369	8055729	All right.
8056289	8067033	Just a couple more stories for you guys and we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and we'll get to your Twitter topics as well at twitter.com slash OLR.
8067073	8068834	But first, a couple last stories for you.
8069014	8069214	Loki?
8072148	8073569	Thank you for watching!
8089498	8090959	Thankfully, that wasn't the case, actually.
8091859	8098542	Namco Bandai came out and said, actually, there is a way to reset your game saves on our game.
8099322	8107385	And what you do is basically upon startup, players can input the command abxylr and it will wipe the save data from the cartridge.
8108186	8111667	You know, how they should have done it on all the games.
8112627	8114028	Resident Evil Capcom.
8115889	8116389	But, uh...
8118297	8122019	So there was a secret code the whole time just hiding out there behind the couch.
8122079	8122379	Who knew?
8122419	8124520	Yeah, unfortunately that's not the case with Capcoms.
8124760	8128662	Do you think that might be one of those things that they kind of announced it now just to kind of like cover their ass?
8128962	8130843	Yes, that's exactly what they did.
8131803	8132203	Interesting.
8132443	8135525	Because everyone's like, whew, okay, maybe I will buy the game.
8138326	8144569	That's interesting though that there was kind of like, I'm imagining that feature probably existed for the purposes of like testing the game.
8144929	8147150	DarkSakura, you might want to listen up because this could be your future career.
8147190	8147910	I am listening.
8148070	8158755	This could be something that was there for the testers to use that they did, you know, because sometimes that's where a lot of these codes come from is like the play testing of the game, right?
8158815	8159335	Like a lot of those.
8159375	8160256	Like the Contra code.
8160696	8162677	Yeah, all that stuff came from like play testing.
8163357	8163917	and so forth.
8164457	8166178	So sometimes those codes kind of get out.
8166938	8171039	Maybe, just maybe, could one actually exist in the Capcom game?
8172020	8172400	I'm sure.
8173640	8178582	So maybe there's an A, B, X, Y, L, R type of thing that maybe will save the day for Capcom too?
8179342	8180162	Could possibly be.
8180222	8180602	Who knows?
8181022	8182143	Probably don't hold your breath though, right?
8182903	8185744	Yeah, or else you'd need a dev system or something.
8185784	8186104	I don't know.
8187258	8188981	And I'm noticing this comment from our chat room.
8189181	8191606	RDG Singe says, so are they backpedaling?
8191646	8193129	Do you consider this backpedaling, Loki?
8194094	8199536	Um, no, because I don't really think they, I mean, okay, maybe a little bit.
8200136	8202837	Just because they did say, well, the whole purpose was to do that.
8203017	8211259	What they should have said, yeah, well, you know, we originally wanted it to be that this is kind of an arcade experience and that's why you don't have this.
8211759	8216080	But if, you know, you really do want to erase your save, then here's how you go about and do it.
8216861	8218261	That would have been the proper response.
8220509	8229696	But instead they sent out something cryptic that looked like trying to crack a code from that horrible Nicolas Cage movie or something.
8229736	8231277	It's just like, what the hell is this?
8231337	8232758	Who's drunk at Namco right now?
8233418	8234259	But you know what, though?
8235019	8237181	In the end, all that matters is the end response.
8237761	8239843	And their game has a code.
8240203	8241284	Capcom's doesn't.
8241444	8244326	So guess which one will be most likely purchased?
8244646	8245126	True enough.
8246147	8250269	I was on the fence about this game, and now I'm back in the maybe I will buy it column.
8251189	8254810	Anyhow, one other story for you guys, and I know some of you are looking forward to this game.
8254830	8257231	It's not a game I play a lot of, but I know a lot of you play it.
8257351	8258251	Modern Warfare 3.
8259172	8260932	Yep, Modern Warfare 3 is coming out.
8261112	8264474	And remember we were talking earlier in the show about Activision Blizzard had a conference call.
8264774	8267435	Well, something they confirmed about Modern Warfare 3.
8267555	8270196	I know it's going to make some of you guys very happy, some of you holdouts.
8270876	8272657	It's going to be available on the Wii.
8273157	8273758	That's right.
8273818	8278540	Check out that cutting edge graphics and technology on the Wii.
8279100	8282802	Modern Warfare 3 is going to be available on the Wii this holiday.
8284443	8287985	Apparently on November 8th, right when all the other versions of the game come out.
8288145	8289586	And it's being made by Treyarch.
8290106	8291067	Spider-Man Web of Shadows
8304099	8305020	Modern Warfare 3 Modern Wii Faire
8333177	8336200	I like that name for it, it makes it sound cute Modern Wefair
8343345	8349270	Alright, let's go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8349310	8351692	The Skype line is open right now.
8352012	8357457	But while we wait for some calls, let's do some Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
8357817	8363481	I want to start from this one from TigerClaw305 because it's news that we forgot to mention and I think it's kind of important.
8363902	8364963	Metroid turned 25 this week.
8366684	8369065	All the old NES games are turning 25, right?
8369105	8380128	Mario turned 25, I think Zelda's 25 pretty soon Metroid as well, or Zelda did turn 25, that was part of what they did at E3 Metroid just turned 25 this past week Yay!
8380568	8392292	In related news, you're old Because I'm sure many of you have played Metroid in the past And that's now a 25 year old game DarkSakura, how does that make you feel that Metroid is a 25 year old game?
8393424	8393824	Perky.
8396205	8397465	Perky and full of ice cream.
8399306	8401246	Moving on to other tweets while we wait for some calls.
8401306	8402967	Again, the Skype line is open right now.
8402987	8406488	1-877-GAME-OLR or as your name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
8406508	8408328	Of course, right as I say that, we get some calls.
8408389	8409269	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8409289	8409609	Who's this?
8410209	8411369	It's the one and only Ranma.
8411489	8412470	Hey, one and only Ranma.
8412490	8412790	What's up?
8413690	8414550	Not too much.
8414570	8420512	I have a, not a question, but something I want to discuss from a podcast a couple of weeks ago.
8420772	8422333	If we can rewind back just a bit.
8422493	8422933	I guess.
8424434	8430057	Well, I wanted to talk about it last week, but it would have been too much for me to cover, so I have to spread it out.
8432239	8438102	So, if you remember, a couple of weeks ago, you posted on your profile an article about sports games.
8439403	8439683	Yes.
8440644	8447448	Now, I was thinking about that, and it's like how the person said that you could say Mario Kart is also a sports game.
8448953	8449653	I do remember this.
8449693	8456298	Wasn't it the whole article about don't be so harsh on sports games because sometimes they're kind of leading the way for other series of games?
8456459	8456979	I remember this.
8457159	8457379	Okay.
8458100	8459361	Yeah, pretty much.
8459701	8467507	And I was thinking, well, I guess in my opinion, you can't say that Mario Kart is a sports game.
8467547	8470990	That's like saying WWE is actual legitimate wrestling.
8472751	8473732	But to some it is.
8474132	8477595	I mean, isn't Mario Kart something you might see on the Ocho?
8479494	8480294	ESPN 8?
8483596	8485696	Have you ever actually looked at ESPN 3?
8486156	8487657	Some of that shit isn't sports either.
8488717	8489758	True, true.
8490098	8491538	But it's like this.
8492159	8495420	Most of the sports games, you have to have a bit of a learning curve.
8495760	8499761	You have to study the manual so you know what you're doing, what all the buttons do.
8499801	8500902	Whereas with games like...
8502082	8505944	Mario Kart, any of the Mario titles, you just pick up the game and start playing.
8505964	8509205	You don't have to learn any strategies or tactics or anything like that.
8509285	8510465	It's like a pick up and play.
8511626	8519209	That's, I mean, but I do understand that it can be considered a sports title, but on the same token, it's not because it's, it's just a fun game to pick up and play.
8519409	8524031	I mean, a lot of sports games you can kind of pick up and play too, like, you know, especially the old school ones.
8524351	8525731	Okay, what's the goal of basketball?
8525891	8526852	Throw ball in net?
8526952	8527772	Alright, I can do that.
8527852	8528172	Let's go.
8528272	8529273	Of course, of course.
8529533	8529633	I'm
8530453	8531634	Look at Tecmo Bowl.
8531714	8534817	I mean, yeah, that was a sports game, but on the same token, it wasn't.
8534837	8539842	All you had to do was push in the command for your play, hit the button, and that was it, you know?
8539962	8542024	It was amazing and awesome.
8542704	8542944	Yes.
8543245	8543925	Yes, it was.
8546347	8549370	So you just called in to bitch about how Mario Kart Wii is not a sport.
8550531	8556757	More or less, but I understand where the person's coming from, but I guess from the way I look at it, it's not really a sports title.
8558234	8561020	Even though it can be considered that, but I'm just saying that's my opinion.
8561882	8563365	Fine, it's not a sports title.
8563786	8564207	Now what?
8565530	8567554	It's a family fun game.
8567594	8568837	That's what you call it, you know?
8570809	8595712	I'm just saying whereas most of the sports games that EA puts out you have to learn the insides and outs of it to play it really well whereas there are other games that are sports games but you don't need to learn the insides and outs you just need to know what the buttons do and just start playing and that's it alright, fair enough anything else on your mind?
8596468	8598229	Yeah, you should try out for the tester too.
8598269	8599570	I'm not trying out for the tester.
8599590	8600551	You could be Rob.
8600851	8602352	I'm fucking fabulous, bitches.
8602532	8602952	Roberts.
8603012	8604453	A gay guy won last season.
8604593	8606294	They're not going to win two seasons in a row.
8606734	8608095	Hey, it could happen.
8608135	8609456	I may start a revolution.
8609516	8612118	Come on now.
8613078	8617641	You could win it and just walk up and win it two snaps up in a B-Monte formation.
8618041	8619342	It's time for a girl to win.
8619482	8621043	But won't you vote for me?
8624058	8624719	You made her cry.
8625079	8625500	Way to go.
8625621	8626322	That's on you, buddy.
8626382	8627765	You're not a team player!
8628446	8629328	Look, hold it.
8629408	8629869	Back it up.
8629909	8630490	Back it up here.
8631332	8634999	Just so you know, I always have the back of Jamie.
8635802	8636722	Loki, and Rob.
8636842	8637063	Always.
8637083	8641204	But no matter what, I will always vote for Jamie because Jamie's the number one.
8641404	8642045	Simple as that.
8642305	8645186	I always got Ook-Chan's back no matter what.
8645526	8646067	Oh, I see.
8646127	8650749	Now we've ranked the OLR hosts from most desirable to least desirable.
8650769	8651789	I am the cutest.
8653110	8656011	No, I'm the cutest.
8656031	8657612	She put up with me for a weekend.
8657672	8659412	I mean, that alone deserves a trophy.
8659692	8661893	And I've got the best rack of anyone in this room.
8662474	8663934	Well, no, maybe Loki's is better.
8664274	8665335	Rama, I'm the cutest.
8667336	8668496	You're more like the fabulous.
8670517	8670857	Fine.
8671217	8671797	I'm fabulous.
8672357	8672717	And cute.
8672937	8673437	Alright, bye.
8673937	8674157	Bye.
8675938	8676738	Let's take another call.
8676818	8677538	I'm done with Ranma.
8677578	8678738	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8678778	8679218	Who's this?
8680278	8680898	The Werenate.
8682259	8682679	What's the name?
8683479	8684159	The Werenate.
8684299	8684959	The Werenate.
8685159	8685539	What's up?
8686579	8690840	Yeah, I was calling because I wanted to comment on your Modern Warfare 3.
8690880	8693401	Oh, you're going to be pre-ordering on the Wii?
8694741	8695381	Most likely.
8697492	8698633	Sucker, why is that?
8698773	8699554	Is that all you got?
8700754	8703236	Yeah, because, you know, I'm a diehard Nintendo fan.
8703997	8704917	Long live Nintendo.
8706599	8710461	And also, I mean, like, I played Modern Warfare 1 on the Wii, and it was pretty nice.
8710481	8711442	It had online play.
8711582	8713083	Why are you saying it won't have online play?
8713363	8715585	You gotta do the waggle.
8717006	8721969	It'll have online play, but it's not gonna be as robust as, you know, with the voice chat and all that.
8722009	8724631	I'd say something like Xbox Live or PlayStation Network.
8724691	8725172	It'll just be...
8725802	8731246	which might actually, to be fair, might be for the best because you don't want to play those games on Xbox Live because people are just rude.
8732287	8738713	I mean, if you shoot someone or blow their head off in real life, do you want to have voice chat with them or do you just want to get the job done?
8740474	8741215	Touche.
8741675	8742055	Fine.
8742376	8743476	The caller has a point.
8744057	8744998	I stand corrected.
8745058	8746639	Yes, I do want to have voice chat with them.
8747980	8748661	Excuse me.
8749081	8751483	I don't like the fact very much that you just blew off my head.
8751783	8753785	I think you should prompt apologize for that, actually.
8754764	8764189	Yeah, you know, so I'm a Wii user, but I can't wait for the Wii U, you know, I think you all should be glorifying the Wii U, because it's going to be a pretty epic
8765540	8767200	Not until we see the games.
8768121	8769661	What we saw at E3 wasn't enough.
8769921	8773702	A system is only as good as the games that are on it, and I am not convinced yet.
8774282	8782483	I mean, yes, they talked about some of these third-party games, but they talked about games that are already coming out this holiday that might not even really end up in their same form.
8782523	8787624	Like, they talked about the Assassin's Creed game is not the same game that's coming out this holiday for the other systems.
8787644	8788584	It's like a separate game.
8789044	8792585	So, I'm not sold one way or the other on Wii U. I mean...
8793405	8793946	Outro Outro Outro
8799042	8800323	Do you not see the tech demos?
8800483	8801164	I mean, come on.
8801184	8803305	It had like tech in on it.
8803325	8804086	Come on.
8804146	8807729	It's going to be changing to more hardcore.
8808449	8810611	You suddenly sound like you're underwater, but that's all right.
8810831	8811472	Dalek voice.
8811992	8813453	Yes, he's got the Dalek voice going on.
8814354	8818157	But I don't know.
8818437	8822801	The demos, it's interesting, but let me ask you this.
8823781	8827144	Can't the Vita and the PlayStation 3 essentially do the same thing?
8830652	8837398	I'm, oops, almost muted it, but the Vita is not even better than the 3DS.
8839139	8843063	Well, it's got, well, I don't know about that.
8843243	8844224	It's kind of relative.
8844244	8845765	It depends on what games it gets.
8846286	8854513	I don't know about the processors, put them side by side, but I imagine that, sorry, Loki's showing off his cheating in his game.
8854533	8857776	He's cheating, getting five million tower bucks from cheating.
8858939	8860601	That's a lot cheaper than buying them.
8861342	8861823	Anyway, sorry.
8870915	8878679	As a developer, I hope that I can see some better games besides that roller skating game and roller goo on there.
8878959	8882240	And the one with the guys in the Speedos trying to get through the walls.
8882320	8883781	That was a real fun game, actually.
8886062	8890644	I'm glad you can say something critical about Nintendo, because I was getting a little worried that you were a little bit too much fanboy.
8890704	8891565	But yes, I agree.
8892045	8895367	Their online as a whole really needs to improve, so I hope they do it.
8895428	8899170	But I will say the 3DS has done some things right online, so we'll see.
8899691	8902192	I don't have one yet, but you can send me one if you want.
8903954	8904434	We'll see.
8904574	8906616	We might have a contest around the holidays.
8906936	8908997	Anyhow, I've got to let you go so we can get more calls, but thanks for the input.
8910438	8910859	Take care, buddy.
8910879	8910979	Later.
8913260	8914160	is taking another call here.
8914700	8915641	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8915661	8916021	Who's this?
8916961	8918902	Yo, guys, it's Xenocore from the OKC.
8918962	8919382	How you doing?
8919402	8921482	What is up, Xenocore from OKC?
8921743	8922463	What's on your mind tonight?
8923303	8923663	Not much.
8923683	8926684	Just been playing a bit of Earth Defense Force 2011.
8927404	8929565	Oh, a game that's near and dear to Loki's heart.
8929585	8930145	What do you think?
8931185	8934406	It's not bad, but I'm not even sure if the game has an ending yet.
8934446	8939868	I've been playing it online so I can have some backup, and every time it gets to the last miss and it just resets.
8941474	8942515	Loki, is this a problem?
8943336	8948480	Well, the very last mission, I mean, it depends on what difficulty you're playing on.
8948540	8952064	The ending's not very long.
8952784	8953225	It doesn't really end.
8953245	8955126	Well, I never figured the ending would be that long.
8955146	8957068	This whole game, it's the gameplay itself.
8957208	8961552	But I do at least want to know what the hell happened because it's just like all your characters vanish.
8962013	8967778	Yeah, you just have to play it on a harder difficulty because each time you beat the game on a harder difficulty, the ending's longer and longer.
8969330	8989236	it would have been nice if they gave you some sort of a hint like play this on the harder difficulty to find out what happens or something like that well I think they also have DLC coming so you know it's hard to say what exactly they'll be having and I've been playing the hell out of 4k kill team as well you're cutting in and out a little bit there but that's alright you've been playing the hell out of what?
8990676	8995818	hammer 40,000 kill team oh didn't you mention this game on an earlier episode of the show I think you did
8996328	8997989	Yeah, I finally grabbed a hold of it.
8998310	8999631	It's not bad for 10 bucks.
8999691	9000651	Definitely worth the money.
9002252	9003613	I might have to look into that.
9003854	9004634	What else have you been playing?
9004674	9005095	Anything else?
9005915	9007316	No, that's about it.
9007336	9008197	Trying to save some money.
9009618	9012080	Any new stories you want to talk about tonight that we talked about on the show?
9012860	9018445	Well, I did want to comment on the whole thing about Diablo 3 going online only.
9019756	9021717	and what company aspects of that are.
9022417	9022757	Go ahead.
9022797	9024037	You're still cutting in and out a little bit.
9024057	9026578	I don't know what's going on with the connection, but I'll let you get your thought out there.
9026918	9027878	I can understand you enough.
9029299	9031980	Blizzard knows that everything is possible with code.
9032040	9033100	All they need is time.
9035040	9040082	They do have to do something for copy protection, but honestly...
9040754	9047397	If they think this is going to stop anything, then they really need to get their coding team and reevaluate who's working for them.
9047417	9052560	Because whoever told them that this is going to defeat online hacking is ridiculous.
9052580	9054881	Because it happens at World of Warcraft right now.
9055261	9055501	Right.
9056521	9056962	That's true.
9057002	9059943	But they ban players from World of Warcraft left and right too, right?
9060390	9062351	Yeah, but that won't keep them from getting back in the game.
9062732	9063392	I guess that's true.
9063652	9064653	What about StarCraft 2?
9064753	9065954	What are the issues that that game's having?
9065994	9066894	Are they having issues too?
9067175	9069716	Well, they have their own variety of issues.
9069756	9074039	It's not so much because there's no real persistence in the game other than you think.
9074499	9079343	But you'll see people do lag hacks and stuff to interfere with the other player's game.
9079803	9080884	Remove the fog of wars.
9080924	9083285	You can see what your player's doing without having you nearby.
9083666	9085827	More gameplay hacks more than anything else.
9086367	9088749	And that's even more critical to the play of the game.
9088849	9090290	So it does more damage.
9092200	9100585	I'm very curious to see just, you know, how legally this all plays out, especially when the first exploit does come down the hill and then suddenly it's impacting the real money trading house.
9101126	9102546	They've got to be thinking of something.
9102627	9105148	There's got to be something in place they're doing.
9105388	9114173	I mean, you know, they're swearing up and down that they've looked at it from a legal perspective, but just because it's totally legal right now, too, doesn't mean it will always be legal.
9114854	9116334	That's the other thing I kind of worry about with them.
9116355	9120437	Especially when they have... The main thing between Second Life and this...
9120937	9123642	Second line, people are making the assets themselves.
9123962	9125845	The game isn't supplying them with assets.
9126426	9129411	If you supply them with the assets, technically Blizzard still owns them.
9130052	9132235	Second line, you have rights to whatever you create.
9134124	9134825	That's interesting.
9134885	9141630	It's going to be very, very strange what happens, but we'll see what happens once the politicians pull their heads out their asses.
9141990	9143892	Blizzard is going to be printing money with this.
9143912	9144733	It's going to be very interesting.
9144813	9146054	All right, Xenocore, I've got to let you go.
9146174	9148396	Skype's acting up, so take care, buddy, okay?
9148856	9149356	All right, later, man.
9149377	9149797	Have a good one.
9150878	9151178	All right.
9151939	9152539	Thank you, listeners.
9152719	9155542	I wanted to hear his thoughts on that, and I know he's cutting in and out.
9155562	9158384	It's probably a little annoying, but I was able to understand most of it.
9158804	9163786	Let me go back to Twitter because I got to get through some more of these Twitter topics here and then I'll see if any more calls are coming in at that point.
9165627	9170710	More Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR as I load them up here.
9171910	9172451	Let's see.
9172591	9174151	We actually don't have a whole lot tonight.
9174251	9175092	Let me go to...
9177899	9183862	Redertainment says, I meant to email you, but can you warn people that deep vein thrombosis is serious?
9184442	9186583	Get up and walk around about every two hours.
9187343	9192226	Yeah, when they say take a break during a long gaming session, they're not kidding.
9192286	9193446	You really should get up and take a break.
9193746	9199789	Even when we raid in WoW, we take a quote-unquote bio break every couple hours for a few minutes.
9199829	9204531	That's a chance for folks to get up, get water, stay hydrated, get a snack, go to the restroom.
9204751	9205292	and so forth.
9205352	9206193	It's just good practice.
9206213	9208756	That guy sat down, I think, for 12 hours.
9208876	9212540	Are we talking about the guy overseas that died or whatever?
9212861	9213161	Yeah.
9214923	9216145	Yeah, what was that all about?
9216605	9218167	It's a 12-hour gaming session.
9219248	9219809	It'll kill you.
9224011	9227093	All right, moving on to more tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
9227113	9228854	A couple from Tigerclaw back to back here.
9230455	9237259	North Korea's Kim Jong-il is running MMO gold farming racket is the tweet that's sent here.
9237359	9240541	This is a news story from Game Informer delivered to us from Tigerclaw.
9241201	9249647	The New York Times is reporting that North Korea is using a team of hackers to infiltrate popular South Korean MMORPGs and farm in-game points.
9250307	9263036	Specially trained North Korean hackers working in concert with South Korean and Chinese operatives have been infiltrating popular MMOs like Lineage, accumulating in-game points, selling them on the internet black market.
9264264	9271887	Wow, the Times say that they've earned over $6 million for their efforts, over half of which has been delivered to North Korean agents in the capital of Pyongyang.
9273068	9275549	Yeah, so please don't support this stuff.
9275929	9281852	Because that's just, I mean, look, people are going to do whatever they have to do to make money, that's fine.
9281892	9289155	But when you support it, like you're supporting devious tactics, like hacking, like credit card information getting stolen and so forth.
9289195	9291316	It's all going to ruin your gameplay experience.
9291696	9291856	Yay!
9291896	9292036	Yay!
9313720	9315441	Ragnarok Violet Ragnarok Violet
9337009	9362351	it does not say oh no it looks like it is in US you can read the description on the app store and I click on it and it takes me to the US app store for Ragnarok Violet I didn't even get that sentence out of my mouth and DarkSakura I heard the click on the iPhone shut up it's free but there oh there's in-game items like you can get pet eggs and all this crap it's like a free thing
9364011	9365052	Way to go, Tigerclaw.
9365573	9367955	We just lost DarkSakura to Ragnarok all over again.
9368296	9369597	Thanks, Tigerclaw.
9370298	9377026	Yeah, but the one problem is that if it works with my IRO account and I'm not playing IRO anymore, then I might be kind of SOL.
9377679	9383984	DarkTetsuya in our chat reminds us about a birthday that happened, saying yesterday there was a birthday that harkens back to our music game roots.
9384524	9390088	Taku Sakiakyabra, I probably mispronounced that name really horribly, turned another year older.
9390149	9396033	But you guys all know Taku, or T-A-Q, not taco, but Taku, turned a year older.
9396433	9397374	How old does that make him?
9398235	9398595	I don't know.
9398675	9399135	A year older.
9399576	9400156	A year older.
9400797	9401938	But here you go, guys.
9402078	9403659	Enjoy some Birthdayholic.
9407657	9407977	There you go.
9407997	9409077	Birthdayholic for Taku.
9409698	9409978	All right.
9410538	9411798	Let's go to Black Lab.
9412098	9412638	Remember him?
9412998	9417760	He used to come to the show years and years ago, like in the first hundred episodes or so.
9418180	9421801	He's listening tonight and sends us tweets and has some Twitter questions.
9422161	9424721	Number one, will there be a drunk show soon?
9425321	9426002	Probably not.
9426222	9427082	I gave up drinking.
9428602	9429182	Probably not.
9429222	9429822	We got old.
9430863	9434924	Question two, does Jamie still have that copy of Owen Don that I gave her?
9435124	9435684	Happy face.
9436127	9438910	How to get a Nintendo fangirl to try playing non-Zelda games
9461684	9466568	Well, if she's not playing non-Zelda games, then she's not much of a fangirl, is she?
9467329	9468069	Of Nintendo.
9468710	9469370	DarkSakura?
9469771	9470111	I don't know.
9470171	9470751	You're the girl.
9471732	9474214	How do you convince other girls to play games that aren't Zelda?
9475795	9477697	Pass over your DS and say, here, give this a go.
9478838	9480699	What if they say, no, I'm too busy.
9482461	9483462	Busy doing what?
9483562	9484102	My hair.
9485383	9486164	Oh, well, that's important.
9486224	9487025	Baking a pie.
9488366	9489306	As long as they share the pie.
9489326	9491068	Doing my application for the tester.
9491721	9496310	I already did that there's always time for games
9499362	9521914	I'm updating my echo phone find something where there's something there's like a Barbie mode where you can do dress up or customization because women like that shit no you want to know what's funny is that like I seriously think that wrestling games those WWF games or whatever WWE games are like dress up dolls for dudes
9523014	9535745	cause seriously you can change your outfit I've seen Dan spend hours making wrestlers it's freaking hilarious alright oh and also you know changing the bikinis out on you know Dead or Alive Volleyball
9537771	9541293	All right, that's going to do it for the Twitter tonight and the Skype line.

9543375	9550540	If you didn't get through tonight, send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com or send us a tweet for next week at twitter.com slash OLR.
9550940	9554442	In the meantime, I'm going to go over to Loki and see if there's any last-minute stories tonight.
9554482	9555062	I don't think there is.
9555103	9555783	I think we got it all.
9555823	9557684	No, it was really slow.
9558345	9561327	Yeah, it was kind of a slow news week, hence why it's kind of a shorter show tonight.
9561367	9565109	But they can't always be action-packed weeks, especially as we get closer and closer.
9565209	9566290	Once we get after Labor Day...
9566730	9568951	It's just going to be go, go, go, go, go until the end of the year.
9569071	9570332	So we'll see.
9570952	9571212	All right.
9571232	9574654	Well, that means we're coming to the close of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

9609874	9617118	And for Dark Sakura to make an audition tape that you all can vote on soon for this show that I can't believe she's actually going to go on.
9617583	9621284	We should stack all of my Sony stuff behind me and go, look at this shit.
9622304	9622904	You owe me.
9624725	9625005	All right.
9625765	9628285	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.
9628765	9629766	Loki, we'll start with you.
9629826	9636547	The cheating cheater of Tiny Tower, the hacker who has five million Tower bucks that he did not purchase.
9637987	9640488	And it's basically infinite because it's not going down.
9641668	9642768	What's your final thought tonight?
9643128	9645189	My final thought is I have 13 floors already.
9647886	9649969	DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?
9650429	9650950	Hire me.
9652651	9656135	And my final thought tonight is tacos.
9657076	9659358	That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
