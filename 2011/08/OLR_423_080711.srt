00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:23,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight, August 7th, 2011, the Vita gets bumped to 2012, the Humble Indie Bundle adds even more games, and can you soon make a living playing Diablo 3?

2
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:38,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:42,575
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

4
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:46,478
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:46,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

6
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:47,839
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Jamie?

7
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a culinary fucking goddess.

8
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

9
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:53,522
[SPEAKER_04]: What makes you a culinary fucking goddess?

10
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:55,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm sharing one of my favorite recipes with you guys today.

11
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:57,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And what would that recipe be?

12
00:00:57,496 --> 00:00:58,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Monkey's brains?

13
00:00:58,417 --> 00:00:58,537
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

14
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,941
[SPEAKER_12]: While, you know, famous in Cantonese cuisine is rarely seen in the United States.

15
00:01:04,722 --> 00:01:05,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Touche.

16
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:06,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Or in Washington, D.C., I should say.

17
00:01:07,564 --> 00:01:16,771
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they are blue potatoes baked instead of fried, but baked with garlic, marjoram, oregano, Himalayan salt, pepper.

18
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Himalayan salt?

19
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:19,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked for Mongolian salt.

20
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:20,834
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

21
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of garlic and plenty of Italian cheeses.

22
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:27,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, garlic salt always makes things better.

23
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I will, I will, but I've got to set up the show first.

24
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:30,179
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

25
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello as well to less of a culinary goddess, but still pretty awesome, Tech Master Loki.

26
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:37,302
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?

27
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:38,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

28
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:38,642
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Loki?

29
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:39,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.

30
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:40,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

31
00:01:40,363 --> 00:01:40,983
[SPEAKER_04]: What's new with you?

32
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:42,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.

33
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:45,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Has there been any culinary works in your life?

34
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:50,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you used to deep fry everything in good times.

35
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:53,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I haven't really done any deep frying in a while.

36
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:54,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that's too bad.

37
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:18,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, let's start talking about games with you guys in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com If you've never joined us for a live show, you should sometime Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at AllGamesRadio, www.allgames.com And, yep, we have our chatters there Let's see, TigerClaw says Rob, did you just say monkeys?

38
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:26,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you must have seen the new Planet of the Apes Nope, didn't see the new Planet of the Apes I heard it was number one in the box office, so it did way better than everyone thought it would

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,401
[SPEAKER_12]: And they threw lots of number two.

40
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:31,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to hate those movies actually growing up.

41
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:35,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think my dad or my brother or somebody really liked those movies and I always thought they were terrible.

42
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:36,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the Charlton Heston.

43
00:02:37,146 --> 00:02:38,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't like Charlton Heston.

44
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:43,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it has nothing to do with the politics side or the gun, my cold dead hands on stuff.

45
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:46,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, I just, God, I don't know.

46
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:48,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Like something about him in movies just irritates me.

47
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:49,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

48
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:51,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's a lot of people that would disagree and that's fine.

49
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:53,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we disagree on this show.

50
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:54,784
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:24,771
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also, I saw Bobby posted on Twitter, there's a Bad Dudes reference in there somewhere.

52
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a bad enough dude to take on, or to save the president or whatever.

53
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:29,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that line from the original Bad Dudes game?

54
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:31,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's pretty funny though.

55
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:36,380
[SPEAKER_12]: And I actually didn't play any Groove Coaster.

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,320
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad.

57
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,101
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fine.

58
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:39,422
[SPEAKER_12]: I played a lot of WoW.

59
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:42,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Mostly because I've been forever alone.

60
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:44,886
[SPEAKER_12]: My husband's gone.

61
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:46,467
[SPEAKER_12]: He'll be back next week though.

62
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:48,839
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been neglecting your consoles.

63
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:50,019
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit.

64
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,242
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually was going to go in and play the Saturn, and I was like, I gotta do what to hook it up?

65
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:54,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Never mind.

66
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:56,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

67
00:03:56,983 --> 00:04:02,226
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually an email that I was reading in the emails, we'll have to get to later on, that kind of asks you about playing the old games in the vault.

68
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:02,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

69
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:03,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Curious to hear about that later.

70
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:07,008
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll get to that in part B. Alright, well Loki, how was your gaming week?

71
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:09,472
[SPEAKER_05]: It was okay.

72
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:12,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I played lots of Groove Coaster.

73
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:13,115
[SPEAKER_05]: That game's pretty fun.

74
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:18,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost seems like it should be like a Q Games game, but here it's not.

75
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:24,261
[SPEAKER_05]: More Grand Theft Auto and more Earth Defense Force.

76
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:28,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, a lot of Earth Defense Force this week, which is kind of cool.

77
00:04:29,744 --> 00:04:31,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Leveling up my tactical guy.

78
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:35,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Finished going through... Well, I had already gone through all the...

79
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:38,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Normal Mode Level Up

80
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:00,634
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty much it.

81
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and now, of course, Tiny Tower.

82
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:05,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have to join the cult that is Tiny Tower.

83
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you on Game Center?

84
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:07,198
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't use that.

85
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:07,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I use that.

86
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you have to add me on there.

87
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, no.

88
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have you on there.

89
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:13,603
[SPEAKER_05]: You are the only person that's on my Game Center.

90
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:16,845
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't see your tower yet because you didn't start playing until today.

91
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:17,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got it.

92
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:18,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

93
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:20,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my game of the week.

94
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:26,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked up the Humble Indie Bundle, which I know is going to come up in the show later, so I'll talk more about the bundle itself when it comes up in the news later.

95
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:32,607
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the games in the Humble Indie Bundle has been taking up a lot of my time, and that's because I think it's terrific.

96
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:33,489
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a terrific game.

97
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:58,476
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's one of those games it's been brought up on the show before and I distinctly remember somebody had called in at the end of the year last year to say that this was their favorite game of the year and I was like oh I'll have to check that out at some point you know and amongst all the other games I try to fit into today I just never got around to it until now but now that I play this game it's just like taking up all my time that I'm not playing like WoW or an MMO or something and that's VVVVVV

98
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:00,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

99
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:01,557
[SPEAKER_13]: The game is fucking cracked.

100
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,678
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is outstanding.

101
00:06:04,138 --> 00:06:12,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It is like Super Metroid meets the Commodore 64 meets an incredibly simple premise of you press button, flip gravity.

102
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this game could have been on the Commodore 64.

103
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:18,125
[SPEAKER_04]: That's obviously kind of like the style they're going for.

104
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:22,847
[SPEAKER_04]: But the music adds like...

105
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:26,410
[SPEAKER_04]: So much to it because the music is amazing in the game.

106
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all chiptune type stuff.

107
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:32,115
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack, Super Meat Boy, that type of stuff, you'll love the soundtrack to this.

108
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:36,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously it takes a lot of influences from more recent gaming.

109
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:46,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you like Super Meat Boy, this type of game is right up your alley because it's about dying over and over and over again on a level until you get it just right.

110
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:49,710
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there's that whole exploration and open world thing.

111
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

112
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:23,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one dungeon or whatever you want to call it that I was in had tripwires.

113
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:26,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And whenever you hit the tripwire, the gravity automatically flipped.

114
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:32,769
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you really had to kind of maneuver your character to hit tripwires, sometimes sequentially, to get through the room without landing on spikes.

115
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:37,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Another area I was in was all about warping from one side of the room to the other.

116
00:07:38,073 --> 00:07:42,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the only way to escape a room would be from one predetermined exit.

117
00:07:42,256 --> 00:07:42,957
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

118
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:57,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

119
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:17,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it all just kind of makes a mood.

120
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:18,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

121
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:22,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly think if the game had just done new graphics, it would have been horribly overlooked.

122
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I think sometimes that whole little retro catch kind of adds a lot to the game.

123
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:31,372
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not just, by the way, the open world Metroid-y part of the game.

124
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,813
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also time trial levels that you can play and...

125
00:08:35,773 --> 00:09:03,765
[SPEAKER_04]: you can play made up worlds like there's like a little level packs in it and so forth so yeah amazing deal because right now you could get this game for a dollar if you wanted to I think you're kind of cheap if you do but I understand some people are broke and in school and what have you it's honestly if you miss the Humble Indie Bundle altogether it's worth the $10 on Steam I think so especially if you like like if you like Super Meat Boy and those type of games retro fan this game is right up your alley

126
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:05,266
[SPEAKER_12]: I bought it when it was two bucks.

127
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:06,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh nice, during the Steam sales?

128
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:07,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Way back.

129
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:08,989
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had it for a while.

130
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:09,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

131
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,810
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really good.

132
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great game.

133
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:14,053
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that was taking up a lot of my time this week.

134
00:09:14,073 --> 00:09:15,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I played some of the other stuff in the bundle.

135
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:21,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I played COGS for a little bit, which is kind of like a puzzle game that's all about, like you know the sliding puzzles, right?

136
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:21,919
[SPEAKER_04]: You know when you have

137
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,140
[SPEAKER_04]: The picture ones.

138
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:46,152
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like you have to move, instead of making a picture, it's like the dual puzzle of line up the wheels right so that way it powers the machine.

139
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:49,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of got that whole like steampunk-ish vibe, but not really.

140
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:50,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

141
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:54,117
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very puzzle-y interface and so forth.

142
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that was fun.

143
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:57,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are kind of the big ones I've checked out.

144
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, most of the same stuff.

145
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:01,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIII.

146
00:10:01,222 --> 00:10:02,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Randomly played Wipeout this week.

147
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:06,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, just wanted to play F-Zero and didn't feel like cooking up the GameCube.

148
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:07,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, oh, let's play Wipeout.

149
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:08,746
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the next best thing.

150
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:11,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there you go.

151
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:12,468
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my gaming week.

152
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:16,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's get into some gaming news.

153
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:19,830
[SPEAKER_04]: After I mention real quick, you should always be following us on Twitter.

[SPEAKER_04]: Five-star reviews on iTunes are much, much, much appreciated.

[SPEAKER_04]: Because we don't make anything off the show.

163
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,236
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't even ask you to pay what you want.

164
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:39,956
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just free.

165
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:40,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Question for you.

166
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:41,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

167
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:42,156
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you think?

168
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:43,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Of?

169
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:44,017
[SPEAKER_04]: The dish.

170
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:44,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what you made?

171
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I a culinary goddess or what?

172
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:50,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've been talking most times, so I haven't been able to really eat it, but it's really good.

173
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:50,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

174
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:51,918
[SPEAKER_13]: See, everybody?

175
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:52,598
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm awesome.

176
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to inflate your ego too much.

177
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:59,739
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to go on Hell's Kitchen or something and get your ego kicked out a little bit.

178
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,620
[SPEAKER_12]: No, because I would punch What's-His-Face.

179
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,500
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be like, you're much nicer to the people on MasterChef.

180
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Gordon Ramsay.

181
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:10,952
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

182
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:12,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

183
00:11:13,113 --> 00:11:15,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

184
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:21,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator PC in chat says, if there was a sequel to VVVVVV, would it be called VVVVVV2?

185
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,920
[SPEAKER_04]: VVVV was 70s or WWWW?

186
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be WWWW.

187
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:28,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would probably be a letter repeated.

188
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,024
[SPEAKER_04]: The soundtrack is called PPPPPPP.

189
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:32,825
[SPEAKER_04]: PPPPPPP.

190
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:37,849
[SPEAKER_04]: But all the songs on the soundtrack start with P, so it's kind of cute.

191
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in the chatroom says, VVVVVV is like Portal, but in 8-bit goodness.

192
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf said he just paid $25 for the Humble Indie Bundle, split between the devs.

193
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:52,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakman says, sliding tile puzzles?

194
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:55,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh, I think I'd rather glue my forehead to a donkey's ass.

195
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,890
[SPEAKER_04]: An ass's ass.

196
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:01,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's, it's neater than it sounds.

197
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:04,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think this, it really depends what types of games you're into.

198
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you like action-y type of games, you're probably not going to get so much out of COGS.

199
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:11,579
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some people that just, to kill time, like to sit there and play a little puzzler.

200
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, some of you probably play Plants vs. Zombies, Bejeweled, those are puzzlers.

201
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:17,723
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of right up that same alley.

202
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:19,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there you go.

203
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:23,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday night.

204
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:24,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to some gaming news.

205
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:25,708
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start off with Loki.

206
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:27,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, yes.

207
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:32,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, apparently, the PlayStation Vita will not be coming out this year.

208
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:33,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad.

209
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:38,712
[SPEAKER_05]: At least, not over here in the United States or North America or in Europe.

210
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It said it'll be coming out in early 2012.

211
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:46,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I'm assuming, Sony being a Japanese company, the Japanese will get theirs holiday, 2011.

212
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:47,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

213
00:12:50,535 --> 00:13:02,119
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, right now, no real reason given other than, you know, I don't know that they're delaying it.

214
00:13:02,219 --> 00:13:15,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a good idea because if it means either more units being produced so that they don't have shortages or, you know, to have better games coming out at launch, I mean, both of those things would definitely help them out.

215
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:24,226
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course they were asked whether they'd be lowering their price because Nintendo did it on the 3DS.

216
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:27,047
[SPEAKER_05]: They lowered their price to compete with the Vita.

217
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:32,168
[SPEAKER_05]: They basically said we packed so much into the device and made it very affordable.

218
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:39,911
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no need to lower the price just because somebody else happens to be in the video game business and decided that they were going to lower their price.

219
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:49,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, there is a lot of components in the Vita, but if that shit isn't going to sell at launch, they will lower the price.

220
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:52,275
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the way things are.

221
00:13:54,697 --> 00:14:04,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Something else that got delayed to early 2012 as well, that'd be Twisted Metal, which was supposed to be coming out in October, and now it's early 2012.

222
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:04,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

223
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:14,273
[SPEAKER_05]: They basically said, you know, late game is only late until it ships.

224
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:17,315
[SPEAKER_05]: A bad game is bad until the end of time.

225
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:20,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Great quote.

226
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:29,422
[SPEAKER_05]: If we ship Twisted Metal tomorrow, going off the response from folks who have played it, I assure you it would never be a bad game.

227
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:36,066
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, they're spending the extra time polishing the game.

228
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:39,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I can wait.

229
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:41,223
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be awesome.

230
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:44,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that game's been in development for quite some time now, hasn't it?

231
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:45,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

232
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:49,069
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go back to the Vita being delayed.

233
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,251
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it boil down to, the cost for delay?

234
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:51,911
[SPEAKER_04]: It's parts?

235
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:53,893
[SPEAKER_04]: It's strategical?

236
00:14:54,013 --> 00:14:54,713
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?

237
00:14:55,214 --> 00:14:59,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you kind of knew about this before the rest of the internet did, didn't you?

238
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

239
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:01,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's up?

240
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing really, they didn't say.

241
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:06,302
[SPEAKER_05]: They said it's 2012. 2012.

242
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:13,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of me wondered if maybe they saw what the 3DS was doing wrong.

243
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:18,711
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was that the 3DS launched without really having any good games at launch.

244
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:19,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Debatable.

245
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:25,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand Street Fighter 4 has its fans, but let's face it, that was a port of a game that had already been out for a couple years, right?

246
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:28,299
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that's your strongest release title, something's up.

247
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:34,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe they were looking at that going, well, what do we have coming out at launch on the Vita?

248
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:39,350
[SPEAKER_04]: If these developers aren't really ready to put out all-star games, maybe now's not the time to put out the Vita.

249
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that was where my mind went.

250
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:46,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, well, maybe the Uncharted people weren't ready to put out the game.

251
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that's your biggest game and that's going to get delayed, let's just delay the whole damn thing.

252
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:53,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Could be.

253
00:15:54,068 --> 00:16:18,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's call the whole thing off Apparently So Alright, well Going to chat.orangeloungeradio.com Black Lab is in chat tonight saying I can tell Rob started talking mid-chew Hey, I gotta eat sometime When I got something to say, I'm gonna say it Let's see Breakman in chat says I got a PSP at full price, if only I'd waited

254
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:21,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's a newsflash.

255
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:28,915
[SPEAKER_04]: You could wait to get a Vita, too, but it's probably going to take a long time for the price to drop on that, especially if it comes out in the first part of next year.

256
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:35,359
[SPEAKER_04]: There could be a small price drop at the end of next year going into holiday 2012.

257
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,383
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not for sure.

258
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:41,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be interested in the Vita if they had Saints Row on that.

259
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:43,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Grand Theft Auto.

260
00:16:43,844 --> 00:16:44,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Might just be a matter of time.

261
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:46,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Either one of those is very interchangeable.

262
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Earth Defense Force.

263
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:52,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of those three, I would definitely be down for a Vita.

264
00:16:53,026 --> 00:17:00,508
[SPEAKER_05]: But as of right now, I've seen how much I play my 3DS, which is not at all.

265
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:04,109
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just don't need another system cluttering up.

266
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:15,201
[SPEAKER_04]: My bank account Alright, well let's talk about the other handheld The 3DS Oh, before we get to 3DS actually Let me ask one more question Does this change your opinion at all about the Vita?

267
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:19,106
[SPEAKER_04]: And I asked this to chat too Does it change your opinion thus far of the Vita?

268
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it change the fact whether you want one or not?

269
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,550
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, I'll start.

270
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,292
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it doesn't really change my opinion of the Vita.

271
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:29,715
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I actually kind of say, you know what, if you're not ready, then that's cool.

272
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:31,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Take your time until you've got a really solid launch lineup.

273
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:41,343
[SPEAKER_04]: And B, the fact that the holidays are going to be killer anyway, I'm kind of glad to not have to spend $250 right now on a Vita as well because you know I'll have to have it.

274
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:44,765
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, I'm not so bothered by this.

275
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:46,166
[SPEAKER_04]: What about you guys?

276
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:46,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

277
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:57,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of just warm about the Vita to begin with, and nothing really stood out so far with the Vita that says, I gotta have that system.

278
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So until I see something like that, then I don't really have to have that system.

279
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,108
[SPEAKER_12]: It depends on finances.

280
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:15,057
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the Vita looks nice, hooray, but I hardly touch my PSP, so why would I want to touch the new one?

281
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:19,903
[SPEAKER_12]: I really didn't play the PSP that much except for Popolo Cross and Loco Roco.

282
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,517
[SPEAKER_04]: There's gonna have to be those must-have games.

283
00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:25,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's really gonna be more of a matter of games.

284
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:29,944
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, even Dissidia wasn't really enough to make me really want to play my PSP.

285
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:37,310
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I got on board with PSP early because the very first time I played Luminous, I was like, oh my god, this is the best music puzzle game ever.

286
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,032
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a PSP the day they came out.

287
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,654
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

288
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:07,416
[SPEAKER_12]: And, but, I mean, I've played stuff that I've liked, but it's never been really enough to keep me.

289
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:09,736
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I've taken it on trips and watched movies on it.

290
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:13,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I have a netbook, so I watch movies on that instead.

291
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:15,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the chatters and see what they have to say.

292
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:21,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Defective Candy in our chatroom says, Kudos to them for taking the time and trying to launch something solid instead of rushing it like Nintendo.

293
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,180
[SPEAKER_04]: SonicM88 says, Vita doesn't interest me.

294
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never liked Sony's games.

295
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:31,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Kitsune says, it may not carry all your favorite games yet, but it definitely has a lot more than 3DS.

296
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm psyched about the Vita.

297
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:35,448
[SPEAKER_04]: DungeonBuster says, doesn't really change my opinion either.

298
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the same opinion that Loki does.

299
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't play handhelds all that much.

300
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:43,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov says, having played it at E3 this year, it doesn't change my opinion.

301
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:45,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Just makes me sad I have to wait longer.

302
00:19:45,456 --> 00:19:48,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Need sound shapes, since it's like the Vita's luminous to me.

303
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:54,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator says, I'd be interested in the Vita if it'll print money, make me a sandwich, and order me several slutty strippers every night.

304
00:19:54,875 --> 00:20:22,257
[SPEAKER_04]: you might be a little bit disappointed I don't think these slutty strippers will be in right away that could be in the 2.0 firmware though so stay tuned Breakman says it's a smart move for Sony to move the Vita to next year they don't want to compare its sales to the sales of the 3DS which I think will be one of the biggest Christmas gifts interesting theory maybe they did it to not compete with the 3DS maybe they want to hand this Christmas to Nintendo maybe they're a little afraid of the competition

305
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,953
[SPEAKER_04]: is that is does that sound too fanboy motivated or or what

306
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:46,198
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it really just is a matter of putting out a polished product because especially with the mistakes that Nintendo's made with bringing the system out and not having the right games for it, that's really hurt their sales.

307
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,004
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that they're really just trying to avoid that trap.

308
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:52,886
[SPEAKER_12]: They've seen how it's bit Nintendo in the ass.

309
00:20:54,096 --> 00:20:56,098
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, let's move over and talk Nintendo then.

310
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:57,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to move on and talk about the 3DS.

311
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,725
[SPEAKER_04]: With the 3DS, there's some more comments from Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata.

312
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you all know who Iwata is.

313
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:06,628
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the man at Nintendo.

314
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:12,673
[SPEAKER_04]: He's talking about the 3DS and talking about kind of the GameCube and how the two relates.

315
00:21:13,634 --> 00:21:19,720
[SPEAKER_04]: He said in an interview that the GameCube suffered because Nintendo did not take opportunities when they were available.

316
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:27,809
[SPEAKER_04]: The general feeling within the company's management is that the console had a chance to succeed, but that the chance was not taken advantage of.

317
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:34,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Iwata has said that the company learned its lesson, and that's why they did a price cut so soon after launch.

318
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:38,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting that they've kind of brought up the comparisons to the GameCube there.

319
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Also wanted to mention this with the 3DS price drop.

320
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:47,303
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some rumors going around that Walmart is going to drop the price early.

321
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:57,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to go to Walmart on August 9th, that's the rumor anyway, they are supposedly dropping the suggested retail price down a little early to the $170.

322
00:21:58,788 --> 00:22:03,591
[SPEAKER_04]: What this means is that you might be able to get your cake and eat it too, meaning...

323
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:21,772
[SPEAKER_04]: if you can buy one of these things in that window between the early price drop and the price drop for everybody else quickly get it on the Nintendo eShop then you will be an early adopter so not only did you get the cheap 3DS but you got the $80 worth of games too so that's one way of working the system

324
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:25,597
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I guess call your local Walmart or check.

325
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:26,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

326
00:22:26,418 --> 00:22:28,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo may put the smack down on that, though.

327
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they can.

328
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:33,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I don't know if you know from the retail angle, but could Nintendo stop this?

329
00:22:33,948 --> 00:22:37,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if Walmart wants to cut the price three days early, can Nintendo stop that or no?

330
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:42,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a couple factors that they have in that.

331
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:49,675
[SPEAKER_05]: One, whether there is map pricing on it or not, which is the minimum advertised price.

332
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:58,318
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they have map pricing in place on it, it may prevent them from advertising it lower than a certain amount.

333
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if they're being price protected on it, any of those...

334
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:16,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of those units that they sold prior to it dropping in price, they don't get any of the money from when it dropped in price.

335
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:18,312
[SPEAKER_05]: So they would be eating the cost on that.

336
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:32,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I wouldn't see Walmart as a company doing this, but I know that, and none of the people I know or work with in the industry do this, but I know there's people out there to do that.

337
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:45,708
[SPEAKER_05]: You can manipulate your price protection by fudging the numbers, if you will, and saying, oh, I didn't really sell as many units as I did, and then you get the price protection, and then you sold those units, you know.

338
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,435
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of ways to work the system, but Walmart's probably too big to do that.

339
00:23:50,715 --> 00:23:52,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't think they would be able to do that.

340
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

341
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that they would be getting any sort of special exception either, but you never know.

342
00:24:00,963 --> 00:24:16,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, I think there's a very small group that this would even really apply to because you're talking about people who won a 3DS, who didn't already buy one, who are really just waiting to seize an opportunity, like it's like couponing or something.

343
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:19,934
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got the extreme couponer crowd of video gamers out there.

344
00:24:20,194 --> 00:24:24,475
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't buy meat until Wednesday because then it's on sale.

345
00:24:24,615 --> 00:24:25,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

346
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:35,059
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the crowd that this type of thing calls to because that means you have to have $170 burning a hole in your pocket right now saying I'm dropping it on a 3DS because I need to be an early adopter and I know I want a 3DS.

347
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:57,028
[SPEAKER_04]: so I don't know if that is really a whole lot of people but if it's you start calling places like on or even you know get out in the car and go to some different places on the 9th what Tuesday and I totally lost track of time yes that's Tuesday and go check out you know who might have dropped the price early because you never know and you have until what Thursday night to connect that thing online

348
00:24:57,782 --> 00:24:58,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Rage!

349
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:58,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Podcast Rage!

350
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:22,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, it's pitchforks and torches.

351
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:23,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, that's kind of where I'm at.

352
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:30,167
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, hey, wait, I have Zelda Color Game Boy that I got for free, so clearly I had it during E3.

353
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:33,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I bought this, like, was it almost day one?

354
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:34,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it day one?

355
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:36,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember when I bought that.

356
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:39,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you had the Japanese 3DSs, like, heck of early.

357
00:25:39,593 --> 00:25:39,893
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

358
00:25:41,494 --> 00:25:44,516
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, though, I had it almost, like, day one, so...

359
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:48,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Twinbee, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

360
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:11,707
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

361
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:32,357
[SPEAKER_12]: But Twinby!

362
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:46,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Why this game?

363
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:51,830
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems interesting that out of all the 3D remakes they could do, we're in Twinbee.

364
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:55,973
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to admit, it's not really the first title you think of.

365
00:26:56,233 --> 00:27:03,777
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Twinbee, though, if you look how the levels are laid out, I think Twinbee does make sense from a graphic sense.

366
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:07,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you've got your clouds with all the bells hidden in them.

367
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,582
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got your bottom layer with... So you can actually move your...

368
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:16,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Same way to Xevious, basically.

369
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, basically the same thing.

370
00:27:18,097 --> 00:27:19,877
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think it would work for the game.

371
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:20,998
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it would be cute.

372
00:27:23,118 --> 00:27:23,398
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

373
00:27:23,998 --> 00:27:24,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

374
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:38,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back a little bit, since we're a little bit delayed between when we say something and when the live listeners hear it, because of the encoding and everything, Kaijudo in chat says, No, you'll know you're an early adopter because your eShop list will have a section for it like the PlayStation Network store did.

375
00:27:39,102 --> 00:27:39,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

376
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:41,923
[SPEAKER_04]: But how do we know the non-early adopters don't see that?

377
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we haven't gotten that far yet.

378
00:27:44,383 --> 00:28:11,729
[SPEAKER_04]: could just be a place that's in the store it's like a heads up or something, who knows Zether in chat says, I hope Twinbee isn't Japan only for the 3DS, it's a good game I would imagine if there's money to be made, why not come out here but of course I don't know, the whole region this is Nintendo we're talking about and the same could be said of the last story, Xenoblade I don't know Zether in chat says, the thing is, Stinger was actually the second Twinbee NES game

379
00:28:13,812 --> 00:28:16,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows what they might do with this 3D remake.

380
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:18,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably won't buy it.

381
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:19,835
[SPEAKER_04]: No, me neither.

382
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:21,335
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just too much.

383
00:28:21,415 --> 00:28:27,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, if I was going to go buy Twinbee, I'd hook up my PC Engine and play my HuCard and play a good version of Twinbee.

384
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the old NES 3D remake.

385
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:33,741
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying the NES version is crap, but I could play a good version.

386
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:35,342
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got multiples.

387
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:38,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, what I would do is probably just play Proteus instead.

388
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:40,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

389
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:41,165
[SPEAKER_05]: More news.

390
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:43,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching.

391
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:44,562
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time.

392
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, they've just expanded the bundle with Steel Storm.

393
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:07,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, the average price is just a little... Well, at the time, it was a little under $5.

394
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:08,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it's just a little over $5.

395
00:29:10,393 --> 00:29:17,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess Linux purchasers are paying a little bit more at $11.62 is the average there.

396
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:20,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course...

397
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:21,864
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

398
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:49,558
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually get the Humble Indie Bundle 2 as well.

399
00:29:50,158 --> 00:29:53,241
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another six games thrown in there.

400
00:29:53,301 --> 00:30:08,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Crenn, Physics Deluxe, And Yet It Moves, VVVVV, and then the set two was Braid, Cortex Command, Machinium, I can't pronounce that shit.

401
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I pronounce that shit?

402
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:12,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Machinarium.

403
00:30:12,682 --> 00:30:13,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Machinarium.

404
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:14,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Machinarium.

405
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:14,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you!

406
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:17,784
[SPEAKER_05]: My mouth just didn't want to form the word.

407
00:30:18,104 --> 00:30:19,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, bleh.

408
00:30:19,824 --> 00:30:22,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mouth was mushed for Machinarium.

409
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:22,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

410
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:25,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Osmos and Revenge of the Titans.

411
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:31,788
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it's a weird week at OLR when I'm the one correcting people on pronunciation.

412
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:32,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what is up?

413
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:37,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Something is in these fries that DarkSakura made us.

414
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:38,596
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, awesome.

415
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:40,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Mouth-numbing awesome.

416
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:45,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like suddenly it's that level in Yoshi's Island where you touch fuzzy and you get dizzy.

417
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:50,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden it's like Loki's trying to read Machinarium and he's like, Machinarium!

418
00:30:51,943 --> 00:30:52,243
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

419
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:12,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

420
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:15,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Made from the tears of Himalayans.

421
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to the humble indie bundle, which may or may not be available in Himalaya.

422
00:31:20,852 --> 00:31:22,753
[SPEAKER_05]: How long are they selling this for anyways?

423
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:26,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's only for about another week.

424
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:33,723
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a limited time, I know that, because I totally missed it last year because, I don't know, I was drunk or something.

425
00:31:33,763 --> 00:31:34,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I just totally missed it.

426
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:36,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And I meant to get it, and I never did.

427
00:31:37,246 --> 00:31:43,892
[SPEAKER_04]: But this year, you betcha I got it, especially because I'd heard such great things about VVVV and I wanted to try it for myself, and I'm really glad I did.

428
00:31:44,232 --> 00:31:50,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm telling you guys, for as many games as you get with this, if you put in six bucks, you've got to get it.

429
00:31:51,878 --> 00:31:57,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if you're like starving student, whatever, at least pay a dollar.

430
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:04,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Go without a soda today and pay a dollar for just the Humble Indie Bundle 3 games.

431
00:32:05,253 --> 00:32:05,974
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so worth it.

432
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:09,196
[SPEAKER_04]: And the money, you know, goes to a good cause.

433
00:32:09,236 --> 00:32:11,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes to wherever you want it to go to.

434
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:14,258
[SPEAKER_04]: You can split it between the different companies and so forth.

435
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:17,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, don't kick yourself later when you miss out on this.

436
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:19,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't be a cheapskate either.

437
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,861
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can afford more than a dollar, then give them ten or whatever.

438
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them as much as you would pay for an Xbox Live Arcade game or what have you at least.

439
00:32:26,883 --> 00:32:29,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think the games are really worth it.

440
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:31,204
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to see a humble indie bundle.

441
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:32,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Part four!

442
00:32:33,345 --> 00:32:34,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's that?

443
00:32:34,426 --> 00:32:36,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Only day and a half, it looks like.

444
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:36,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Better hurry.

445
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:37,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Day and a half.

446
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:40,309
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have all the money go to charity if you want.

447
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:42,750
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the cool thing about it.

448
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:46,753
[SPEAKER_04]: You better hurry up on that, especially those of you listening to the podcast.

449
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:52,476
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's after Monday night, you might already be screwed, but you really gotta check that out.

450
00:32:53,596 --> 00:33:00,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on to something less humble, and wouldn't you know it, it's another story about Capcom.

451
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:00,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Like...

452
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:02,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

453
00:33:16,857 --> 00:33:20,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom is testing the waters in Japan on something.

454
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a demo of a game called Nazu Waka Yakata.

455
00:33:25,523 --> 00:33:27,844
[SPEAKER_04]: It is an interesting title.

456
00:33:27,904 --> 00:33:29,926
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't use buttons on the 3DS.

457
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:32,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It relies on sound and the microphone.

458
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:35,869
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like this little trailer that I'm playing in studio for the games.

459
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:39,372
[SPEAKER_04]: We can kind of look at it here, get the sense of what this game's all about.

460
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:42,074
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you...

461
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:52,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if this is kind of like Seaman or something where you talk and interact with the on-screen characters.

462
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,621
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of the sense I get.

463
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:55,383
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a ghost.

464
00:33:55,423 --> 00:33:57,225
[SPEAKER_04]: He has no feet and he's a ghost.

465
00:34:03,345 --> 00:34:03,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Mika!

466
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:04,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Mika!

467
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:04,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Mika!

468
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:55,910
[SPEAKER_04]: now granted that's a cheap demo and one could argue that well you're still getting to play at least part of the game but uh doesn't something strike you as really really wrong about the concept of a paid demo especially from a company that's thrived on you know great word of mouth from free demos throughout the years like I don't know Dead Rising like a lot of people decided they wanted that game based off the demo Lost Planet same type of thing right so why now a change in the strategy

469
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:03,888
[SPEAKER_04]: was this maybe a part of the whole they were going to charge for the Mega Man Legends 3 prototype which was essentially a paid demo

470
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:06,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what is going on?

471
00:35:06,427 --> 00:35:07,768
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think of paid demos?

472
00:35:08,528 --> 00:35:09,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a rip?

473
00:35:09,068 --> 00:35:09,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it worth it?

474
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:11,348
[SPEAKER_12]: It depends on how much of the game you're getting.

475
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:12,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

476
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:17,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if it is, like, a really in-depth demo, then, yeah, I can see $254.

477
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:25,952
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, keep in mind, we used to get the PlayStation... People used to just basically buy the PlayStation magazine thing for the demo discs.

478
00:35:26,252 --> 00:35:26,932
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's true.

479
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:27,572
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

480
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,252
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an interesting comparison.

481
00:35:28,272 --> 00:35:30,293
[SPEAKER_12]: And the same was done with the Xbox magazine.

482
00:35:30,313 --> 00:35:31,873
[SPEAKER_12]: The same was done with Dreamcast.

483
00:35:31,893 --> 00:35:32,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

484
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:35,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's not the first time they've done this kind of crap.

485
00:35:35,575 --> 00:35:35,855
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, look at...

486
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:03,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead Rising Case Zero Dead Rising Case Zero

487
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of looked at it as DLC that didn't require the game.

488
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I kind of let it slide.

489
00:36:28,126 --> 00:36:35,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something extra that wasn't actually in the game that had its own achievements, it had its own ranking, it was its own kind of standalone thing.

490
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:42,403
[SPEAKER_12]: What if for people who've bought the demo for the game, they get something cool when the actual game comes out?

491
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:46,622
[SPEAKER_12]: What if that's associated with it?

492
00:36:46,642 --> 00:36:47,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we don't have that detail.

493
00:36:48,563 --> 00:36:49,084
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's funny.

494
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a similar comment we have in chat.

495
00:36:51,125 --> 00:37:02,092
[SPEAKER_04]: ChalacesPop in our chatroom says, If it was a pre-order bonus disc that came with a cash deposit where I could use that money down against the retail version of the game and I don't buy it, my loss, then I'd be okay with it.

496
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,314
[SPEAKER_04]: But to buy a demo and then buy the retail version for full price?

497
00:37:05,814 --> 00:37:06,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

498
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:08,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd just wait for reviews and go straight to the retail.

499
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:12,690
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're going to have to work out some sort of perk with that or it's going to fail.

500
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,992
[SPEAKER_12]: They have to give people incentive, especially for such a bizarre looking game.

501
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:22,895
[SPEAKER_04]: What an interesting way that digital distribution could go, though.

502
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:34,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine if, and I guess to some extent one could argue you kind of have this already with some things, but what if you could play the first stage of a game by paying two bucks?

503
00:37:35,141 --> 00:37:38,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you like it, you buy the entire game for an extra thirty-eight.

504
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Xbox Arcade Game Room Game Room Game Room

505
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:01,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I think more about Fable 2.

506
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:03,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they did this.

507
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:07,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they chopped up Fable 2 into like six chapters and they put it out as episodes.

508
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:09,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So they kind of did something like this.

509
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:13,115
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it was a while after the whole thing had already been released.

510
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:16,138
[SPEAKER_04]: They just wanted to sell as many freaking copies of that game any way they could.

511
00:38:16,438 --> 00:38:23,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Slice it, dice it, circumcise it, whatever you got to do to sell the game bit by bit, little by little.

512
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:23,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

513
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:24,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

514
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:25,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Milk that franchise.

515
00:38:26,227 --> 00:38:26,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

516
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:33,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Dungeon Buster says, Wolf3D gave you the first few levels for free, and then if you wanted the whole game, then you paid.

517
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:34,272
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't pay up front.

518
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:35,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with Doom.

519
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:39,015
[SPEAKER_04]: One could argue that you might have paid for Wolfenstein 3.

520
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,136
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I did pay for shareware.

521
00:38:41,596 --> 00:38:42,657
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to buy the shareware discs.

522
00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:44,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you used to have to buy the discs.

523
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,341
[SPEAKER_05]: You would go buy the floppies at the store that already had it on there.

524
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:50,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that was fine.

525
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing, though, about shareware, for the most part...

526
00:38:53,723 --> 00:39:21,290
[SPEAKER_05]: shareware you could enjoy the game as a whole with just the shareware like you would get one campaign of it I guess but you could get the additional campaigns if you had the full like Wolfenstein you play through the whole first campaign but there's four campaigns total with the full version this is a demo this is not you know part of the game this is the demo this is Capcom figuring out ways to be dicks

527
00:39:22,853 --> 00:39:32,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, whether it's locking saves or weird DRM, it's their way of, you know, how can we make more money and fuck people over?

528
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's what we do best.

529
00:39:34,365 --> 00:39:35,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom!

530
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:40,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but this is not the same Capcom from a year ago that started Mega Man Legends in the first place.

531
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Bobby Kotick running Capcom for some reason?

532
00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:44,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he like this all of a sudden?

533
00:39:45,275 --> 00:39:46,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he like, uh...

534
00:39:47,372 --> 00:39:51,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Fred Savage where he wears a bunch of different skin suits Did Activision buy Capcom?

535
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:53,477
[SPEAKER_04]: We just didn't hear Is that what happened?

536
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:15,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So Alright Anyhow, I guess at the end of the day if you don't like it, don't buy it That's how they'll get the message It's a weird Japanese game that will probably never make it over here so that is easy enough And I'm saying it to the Japanese listeners all three of you Kitsune, IkumaJP, and I think there's one other

537
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,761
[SPEAKER_04]: All three of you, make a stand.

538
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:23,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Three out of three OLR listeners in Japan reject this game.

539
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:26,222
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

540
00:40:27,582 --> 00:40:29,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, how about some news about Harmonix?

541
00:40:29,283 --> 00:40:30,863
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't really heard from them in a while, have we?

542
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:31,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I heart Harmonix.

543
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:32,783
[SPEAKER_04]: What's new with Harmonix?

544
00:40:32,823 --> 00:40:39,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever happened to that... Sorry, I know this isn't what you're reporting on, but whatever happened to that freaking game they were supposed to announce at E3 that kind of disappeared?

545
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,611
[SPEAKER_12]: What you mean, VidRhythm?

546
00:40:44,672 --> 00:40:45,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, VidRhythm.

547
00:40:45,632 --> 00:40:46,612
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't say much about it.

548
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:49,173
[SPEAKER_12]: No real details yet.

549
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:51,654
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, they're happy.

550
00:40:52,254 --> 00:40:56,396
[SPEAKER_12]: They like not being a part of Viacom or any other, you know, com there is.

551
00:40:57,356 --> 00:41:04,519
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, Tracy Rosenthal Newsome, who is the VP of production, said it's been a terrific opportunity.

552
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:13,142
[SPEAKER_12]: And I quote, We are very well supported, but really the most important thing is that there's a huge amount of creative energy that has bubbled up during our independence.

553
00:41:13,983 --> 00:41:21,286
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been in development of Dance Central 2, and they're putting small games together, making prototypes, and innovating, so...

554
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:29,491
[SPEAKER_12]: They are still working on VidRhythm, which there's not too many details, but it's just been described as fun.

555
00:41:30,272 --> 00:41:32,554
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not giving a timeline, but we'll be hearing about it soon.

556
00:41:32,614 --> 00:41:33,554
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun.

557
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:37,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, VidRhythm is made up of vid and rhythm.

558
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:40,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And fun.

559
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,902
[SPEAKER_12]: But right now, the focus is on Rock Band DLC.

560
00:41:46,063 --> 00:41:48,485
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's saying that Rock Band 3 still has tons of life left in it.

561
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:51,187
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

562
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:58,881
[SPEAKER_12]: We can be expecting, of course, Dance Central 2 on Connect in fall.

563
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:01,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Any thoughts on possible Rock Band 4 next year?

564
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think, no, it's still too soon to bring?

565
00:42:04,204 --> 00:42:04,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's too soon.

566
00:42:05,165 --> 00:42:05,925
[SPEAKER_04]: You think, really?

567
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:06,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

568
00:42:10,249 --> 00:42:12,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I was randomly thinking about that the other day.

569
00:42:12,512 --> 00:42:19,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously all those games took this year off, except for Dance Central, but the plastic instrument games are taking the year off.

570
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:24,604
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that Guitar Hero is not dead.

571
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:28,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they've said Rock Band's not dead, but they're all taking a break.

572
00:42:28,988 --> 00:42:34,933
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wonder if it's a break until next year or maybe it's going to be a break long enough for the next wave of consoles.

573
00:42:36,715 --> 00:42:37,575
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good thought.

574
00:42:37,675 --> 00:42:42,459
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think right now it's just they're really trying to avoid that oversaturation.

575
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,602
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got a good product now.

576
00:42:45,722 --> 00:42:48,965
[SPEAKER_12]: They're still selling something without having to develop anything new right now.

577
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:56,211
[SPEAKER_12]: So as long as it's selling and as long as people keep buying the download packs, then there's no reason for them to make a new one yet.

578
00:42:57,433 --> 00:42:59,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan Central 2 is probably going to sell really well.

579
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:03,696
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll probably stay a huge Kinect seller through the holidays.

580
00:43:04,136 --> 00:43:05,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody knows it.

581
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:08,298
[SPEAKER_04]: First one was a quality Kinect.

582
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:09,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Dance Masters.

583
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:10,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

584
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and see what you can get a whole lot sooner than the holidays as in next week.

585
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:21,783
[SPEAKER_04]: What's coming out next week in America?

586
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much of anything.

587
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Hasn't that been the reaction for the past four weeks?

588
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:30,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no.

589
00:43:30,503 --> 00:43:31,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing has freaking come out of here but Catherine.

590
00:43:31,924 --> 00:43:37,048
[SPEAKER_05]: There was actually stuff last week, or this week I should say.

591
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:40,150
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the next week there really is hardly anything.

592
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:40,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's...

593
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:43,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what we got, and I'll run it down real quick.

594
00:43:43,393 --> 00:43:44,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, can I say this real quick though?

595
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:50,321
[SPEAKER_04]: It did make the show tonight, but there was a big press release about how Catherine is Atlas' biggest launch seller ever.

596
00:43:50,381 --> 00:43:52,143
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already sold like 200,000 copies.

597
00:43:52,624 --> 00:43:57,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta admit, there is this cynical part of me that's kind of like, you sold that much because there's nothing else to buy right now.

598
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:59,151
[SPEAKER_04]: There is nothing else.

599
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:18,040
[SPEAKER_05]: it also helps that you put a woman with large breasts on your yeah that helps too that does help too yeah and all the trailers have been you know her sleeping with a dude it just shows America wants porno games think about it yeah they do um

600
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:20,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here's what we got coming out next week.

601
00:44:20,836 --> 00:44:21,776
[SPEAKER_05]: All DS titles.

602
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:24,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Touch and Play Collection on the Nintendo DS.

603
00:44:24,337 --> 00:44:25,317
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bunch of casual games.

604
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:26,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Hurrah!

605
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:28,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

606
00:44:28,758 --> 00:44:30,299
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an adventure game on the DS.

607
00:44:31,899 --> 00:44:33,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And Puzzler World 2.

608
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, another collection of casual puzzle games.

609
00:44:35,901 --> 00:44:36,501
[SPEAKER_05]: That is it.

610
00:44:36,701 --> 00:44:36,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.

611
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:39,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing else to report on.

612
00:44:39,862 --> 00:44:41,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it because kids are getting ready to go back to school?

613
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:43,063
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's just a dead week.

614
00:44:43,303 --> 00:44:43,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

615
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:46,044
[SPEAKER_05]: A week after there's some stuff.

616
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:48,825
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know...

617
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:54,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well let's travel to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates.

618
00:44:54,243 --> 00:44:55,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if it's a similar story over there.

619
00:44:56,884 --> 00:44:59,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll tell you this, on the Xbox 360 this week, nothing.

620
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:02,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing coming out on the 360 this week.

621
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:09,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Going over to the PlayStation 3, WWE All-Stars is released this week from THQ, so I guess you have that.

622
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:15,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the Nintendo systems, seeing if there's anything coming out there.

623
00:45:18,576 --> 00:45:20,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I have the PSP up first on my list.

624
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:28,938
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Monhooniki, Poka Poka, Ailu Muraji, and then Uta No, Prince Sama Repeat.

625
00:45:29,738 --> 00:45:31,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, those are the two games coming out.

626
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:33,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Uta means song or theme.

627
00:45:33,479 --> 00:45:39,460
[SPEAKER_04]: That first one, the Monhooniki, is a farm fish and hunt monsters RPG on the PSP.

628
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,741
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second one there is, it looks like it's from Broccoli.

629
00:45:46,088 --> 00:45:46,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh oh, let me look at it.

630
00:45:48,009 --> 00:45:49,030
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought Broccoli went into business.

631
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, they're still there.

632
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:56,194
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like it might be like a... It's a dating sim for girls.

633
00:45:56,274 --> 00:45:57,055
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty boy.

634
00:45:57,395 --> 00:45:58,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty boy dating sim.

635
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:01,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Theme of the prints, repeat.

636
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:04,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it could be like a redo.

637
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:07,701
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's called repeat, it could be like a re-release or something like that.

638
00:46:08,473 --> 00:46:15,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Special Edition Whatever, I don't think anyone here is going to be importing that Kitsune, Ikuma, JP, any interest in that game?

639
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:38,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking no and that's that's that's it you go to the Wii there's nothing 3DS Super Pokemon Scramble I guess that's kind of a big deal it is a Pokemon game coming out it's not like an official like Pokemon black or white type of Pokemon game but it is a Pokemon related universe game that's probably the biggest release this week unless you want to get like a new pouch for your 3DS with Street Fighter characters on it

640
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:39,480
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go!

641
00:46:40,421 --> 00:46:43,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Your very busy release date schedule in Japan.

642
00:46:43,824 --> 00:46:44,405
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Europe?

643
00:46:44,925 --> 00:46:45,726
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a few things.

644
00:46:46,407 --> 00:46:51,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, today, well I guess already, Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 came out.

645
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:57,358
[SPEAKER_12]: On the 10th we have Fruit Ninja Connect and Hysteria Project 2 for PSP and PlayStation 3.

646
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:00,321
[SPEAKER_12]: And on the 11th we have Edge, and that's it.

647
00:47:02,103 --> 00:47:02,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Meh.

648
00:47:03,578 --> 00:47:06,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God we do have some people in Japan who actually listen to this show.

649
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:12,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Katsune actually is jumping in saying, Uto no Prince-sama is actually an anime in Japan.

650
00:47:12,944 --> 00:47:14,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is an actual anime.

651
00:47:14,525 --> 00:47:16,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, I'm actually trying to... Opening theme.

652
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:18,547
Yeah, I want to play that.

653
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:18,887
Shoujo.

654
00:47:18,907 --> 00:47:19,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll watch it.

655
00:47:19,808 --> 00:47:19,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Ugh.

656
00:47:33,735 --> 00:47:35,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Just watching that trailer gave me a period.

657
00:47:36,218 --> 00:47:36,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

658
00:47:38,601 --> 00:47:39,682
[SPEAKER_12]: No ice cream for you.

659
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:41,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

660
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:43,687
[SPEAKER_05]: More gaming news, Loki.

661
00:47:45,008 --> 00:47:47,711
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very wonderful image.

662
00:47:48,152 --> 00:47:51,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a uterus.

663
00:47:51,596 --> 00:47:52,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make a baby.

664
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Click it, chirp, chirp.

665
00:48:17,092 --> 00:48:36,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a card RPG strategy game or whatever And it kind of looks a little medieval-ish And so Bethesda's saying, hey, that infringes on our own trademark, the Elder Scrolls I don't know if I'd buy that

666
00:48:37,687 --> 00:48:39,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Monopoly on Scrolls

667
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:09,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Cables, electronics, anything

668
00:49:11,926 --> 00:49:14,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, these people are what we call assholes.

669
00:49:16,169 --> 00:49:17,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Or their lawyers are assholes.

670
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:24,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you know, when it's a generic, it would be different if it was like the Elder Cards or something like that.

671
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:27,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you got something there, maybe.

672
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:34,504
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, if a word scrolls, which no one owns the trademark to the word scrolls, okay?

673
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:36,405
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the Elder Scrolls.

674
00:49:36,585 --> 00:49:40,308
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was like the Elder Card Scrolls

675
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:50,816
[SPEAKER_05]: The Elder Parchments Armageddon That might be a case We're going to file a lawsuit against you so you little indie developer bear do what we want

676
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do big companies have to be bullies like that?

677
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:14,431
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a double-edged sword.

678
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:29,098
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically they have to protect their intellectual properties but at the same time they kind of overstep their boundaries and try to go after people that really aren't trying to infringe on their intellectual properties and that's what's going on here.

679
00:50:29,558 --> 00:50:36,401
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because the people that make the games aren't necessarily the suits and the lawyers that are actually going after these people.

680
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:36,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It's

681
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:39,382
[SPEAKER_05]: and separate entities altogether.

682
00:50:43,184 --> 00:50:43,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

683
00:50:45,444 --> 00:50:47,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly this will get settled out of court.

684
00:50:48,506 --> 00:50:51,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Which means they're probably going to end up being forced to change the name and then that's it.

685
00:50:51,947 --> 00:50:53,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is ridiculous.

686
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:54,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they kind of stick to their guns and don't do it.

687
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:56,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Call it Mind Scrolls.

688
00:50:56,949 --> 00:50:58,770
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

689
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on.

690
00:51:00,151 --> 00:51:02,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about some Connect news related on the Xbox.

691
00:51:03,252 --> 00:51:07,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently a rating has been spotted for Connect Fun Labs Airband.

692
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that is the next Fun Lab that's going to come out.

693
00:51:11,638 --> 00:51:15,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys know that that whole like be in a talk show thing came out for Fun Labs?

694
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I have yet to play it.

695
00:51:16,721 --> 00:51:18,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess Sparkler's out too.

696
00:51:18,582 --> 00:51:20,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

697
00:51:20,484 --> 00:51:23,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was Avatar Connect.

698
00:51:23,326 --> 00:51:25,168
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's called, Avatar Connect.

699
00:51:25,308 --> 00:51:28,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that came out, and then the sparkler thing that they were showing at E3 came out.

700
00:51:28,391 --> 00:51:29,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played either one.

701
00:51:29,371 --> 00:51:31,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about either one of those.

702
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,555
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, at some point, you should take your Kinect out of the box.

703
00:51:33,835 --> 00:51:34,456
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll work a lot better.

704
00:51:34,476 --> 00:51:36,257
[SPEAKER_12]: As soon as someone lends me his Dance Masters.

705
00:51:37,098 --> 00:51:37,398
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

706
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:39,360
[SPEAKER_12]: He said you were going to lend it to me.

707
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,061
[SPEAKER_04]: You have Kinect Adventures to play.

708
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:41,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Go rafting.

709
00:51:41,902 --> 00:51:43,664
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I don't want to go rafting.

710
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:46,727
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do Avatar Connect.

711
00:51:47,267 --> 00:51:49,949
[SPEAKER_04]: You can host your own Oprah show as your avatar.

712
00:51:52,991 --> 00:51:54,752
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do Connect... Okay, okay.

713
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Connect Sparkler.

714
00:51:56,212 --> 00:51:58,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like having fire in your hands.

715
00:51:59,274 --> 00:51:59,995
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't like fire?

716
00:52:00,055 --> 00:52:00,935
[SPEAKER_12]: I want a para para.

717
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like if fire was lame.

718
00:52:07,279 --> 00:52:10,061
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, you know, how can you make fire lame?

719
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:10,801
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't.

720
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:11,501
[SPEAKER_05]: But yet...

721
00:52:12,904 --> 00:52:15,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Connect Fun Labs manages to make fire lame

722
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:34,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I really hope it is.

723
00:52:34,646 --> 00:52:35,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope it is.

724
00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:42,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I could relive that scene from Big over and over again, and I will be the life of my own party.

725
00:52:42,288 --> 00:52:43,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, though.

726
00:52:43,149 --> 00:52:48,050
[SPEAKER_04]: In about another year, wouldn't something like that entertain Josh for like 15 minutes at least?

727
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:48,330
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

728
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:49,010
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

729
00:52:51,491 --> 00:52:52,611
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even a babysitter?

730
00:52:52,891 --> 00:52:53,031
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

731
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:53,752
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

732
00:52:53,772 --> 00:52:55,832
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

733
00:52:56,252 --> 00:52:58,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Connectimals would entertain him, but, you know...

734
00:53:00,717 --> 00:53:01,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Connect Fun Labs, no.

735
00:53:02,018 --> 00:53:05,701
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, hey, look, haha, look at all these indie guys who are doing all these hacks and stuff.

736
00:53:06,002 --> 00:53:07,803
[SPEAKER_05]: We want a piece of that action, you know.

737
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:09,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Come to Connect, because it's fun.

738
00:53:09,765 --> 00:53:11,987
[SPEAKER_05]: It's whimsical.

739
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:16,971
[SPEAKER_05]: No, all this shit's gonna be is fucking Wii music, okay?

740
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:18,813
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all this bullshit.

741
00:53:20,595 --> 00:53:33,766
[SPEAKER_05]: God, even saying the word Wii music just flashes me back to the E3 press conference where Miyamoto comes out playing a fucking fake saxophone thing and how lame that was.

742
00:53:34,126 --> 00:53:36,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, ah, it burns!

743
00:53:37,629 --> 00:53:38,810
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so terrible.

744
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:41,913
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you're suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or something.

745
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:43,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm suing Nintendo.

746
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:45,636
[SPEAKER_05]: PTSD from their damn conference.

747
00:53:47,756 --> 00:53:48,497
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE GAME A MONTH

748
00:54:06,134 --> 00:54:11,519
[SPEAKER_04]: We're targeting a frequency of about one a month for Xbox Live Arcade portfolio that will have Kinect integration.

749
00:54:11,919 --> 00:54:14,562
[SPEAKER_04]: That will be really powerful and differentiate the platform.

750
00:54:14,902 --> 00:54:17,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, coming out very soon, Fruit Ninja Kinect.

751
00:54:17,664 --> 00:54:18,525
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll kick things off.

752
00:54:19,366 --> 00:54:22,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Fruit Ninja Kinect, eh, that's stupid, silly fun.

753
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:29,595
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of the other stuff that they had, you know, like the new Burnout game, just makes me want to cry.

754
00:54:29,675 --> 00:54:30,256
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's...

755
00:54:32,017 --> 00:54:39,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Burnout, a great franchise, great racing game, and we have this top-down thing where I gotta hop up and down to make my car explode.

756
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:41,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Lame.

757
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,820
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't Micro Machines, this is fucking Burnout.

758
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:52,642
[SPEAKER_05]: If I wanted to play Micro Machines, the top-down racing game, from like the 90s, I'd play Micro Machines.

759
00:54:53,842 --> 00:54:54,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe 80s.

760
00:54:54,943 --> 00:54:55,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Might be before the 90s.

761
00:54:57,383 --> 00:54:58,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Freaking John Machida.

762
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:00,984
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm talking about.

763
00:55:03,224 --> 00:55:03,605
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

764
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:06,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on, I guess, to the classic game of the week.

765
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:08,429
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just running through the news tonight.

766
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:11,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a slow news week.

767
00:55:11,272 --> 00:55:17,438
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to fill a three-hour show when there's not too much going on outside of kids going back to school and so forth.

768
00:55:17,498 --> 00:55:21,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially look at what's coming out this week in games.

769
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:21,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

770
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:25,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So why not go back and revisit a classic?

771
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:33,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week here on the show, DarkSakura takes a step into the vault and finds a classic video game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, study this.

772
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,452
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what game did you pick?

773
00:55:37,892 --> 00:55:39,373
[SPEAKER_12]: I picked a really fucked up game.

774
00:55:39,853 --> 00:55:40,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Game series, I should say.

775
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Black Matrix.

776
00:55:43,354 --> 00:55:44,975
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually Black Slash Matrix.

777
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like Keanu Reeves?

778
00:55:47,776 --> 00:55:47,996
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

779
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:51,978
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually a tactical RPG series.

780
00:55:53,378 --> 00:56:01,642
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's sort of like... It kind of does like a mimicking of Christian religious themes, but it's kind of different.

781
00:56:01,902 --> 00:56:04,623
[SPEAKER_12]: It has heaven, hell, earth, and all the people that live there.

782
00:56:05,183 --> 00:56:12,949
[SPEAKER_12]: and the first one came out in 1998 for the Sega Saturn and it was just so weird.

783
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:31,903
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, you play as a different character who belongs to a dominatrix of some sort and then you fight sort of like you've got your move, your attack, your item that's all a turn-based strategy game type of game.

784
00:56:33,103 --> 00:56:37,084
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't really quite get into it, but it had a very interesting story, I should put it that way.

785
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:53,529
[SPEAKER_12]: You also had counters, you could defend, you could dodge attacks, you also had a waiting attack, you also had magic commands, you also had different spell effectiveness that changed from turn to turn that was controlled by biorhythms.

786
00:56:54,689 --> 00:57:11,579
[SPEAKER_12]: you had instead of magic points you had blood points and you can distribute your blood points to all the usable characters to use for their spell casting and you get more by attacking defeated enemies so you basically kill them and steal their blood

787
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:39,452
[SPEAKER_12]: and then you can actually put blood points into weapons to unleash a special attack called its latent ability or you could make it more effective you could add different types of damage that the weapon would deal and then after each battle you get a letter grade rank depending on how well you did and so you get bonus items, money and experience depending on how well you did in battle which I thought was a really cool system

788
00:57:40,032 --> 00:57:51,057
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically, the main character of the first one is named Abel, who is an amnesiac, and he is the main protagonist of Black Matrix.

789
00:57:51,377 --> 00:57:57,060
[SPEAKER_12]: He's basically an angel, and he's locked up in the prison for the crime of love.

790
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:03,625
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, he can change, uh, black wings into white wings and all kinds of different stuff.

791
00:58:03,685 --> 00:58:07,389
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you get your different, um, masters, your dominatrixes.

792
00:58:07,409 --> 00:58:13,575
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you have Demina, Purika, Michette, Cureshus, and Prob.

793
00:58:14,876 --> 00:58:18,019
[SPEAKER_12]: So, who I always used to just call Plague, but...

794
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:22,980
[SPEAKER_12]: You also could get a male master named Zero who was available after a code.

795
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,201
[SPEAKER_12]: So you had all kinds of different ones.

796
00:58:24,741 --> 00:58:27,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Then Black Matrix 2 came out.

797
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:29,262
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, let me go back.

798
00:58:29,642 --> 00:58:37,104
[SPEAKER_12]: I should actually talk about Black Matrix AD Advanced and then Black Matrix Cross are in the same series.

799
00:58:37,564 --> 00:58:39,885
[SPEAKER_12]: They're the same game pretty much.

800
00:58:39,945 --> 00:58:42,566
[SPEAKER_12]: They just add different elements to the game.

801
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:43,686
[SPEAKER_12]: So I forgot to mention those.

802
00:58:44,466 --> 00:58:51,873
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we got, okay, Black Matrix 2 came out for the PlayStation 2 on March 28, 2002, and it's set in the Hell Realm.

803
00:58:52,894 --> 00:58:55,156
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's, again, more of the same stuff.

804
00:58:55,276 --> 00:59:01,141
[SPEAKER_12]: You have, instead though, you have your main character, who was like the strongest devil in Hell, and then he got amnesia.

805
00:59:01,362 --> 00:59:01,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Oops.

806
00:59:02,863 --> 00:59:06,927
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, you know, it has, the story actually revolves around that.

807
00:59:07,862 --> 00:59:08,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Black Matrix Zero

808
00:59:25,783 --> 00:59:27,484
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's pretty much it.

809
00:59:27,604 --> 00:59:32,688
[SPEAKER_12]: You really cannot get them in English unless someone has managed to do some kind of patch.

810
00:59:33,888 --> 00:59:38,351
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're really fucked up games.

811
00:59:38,691 --> 00:59:41,113
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, they have great music.

812
00:59:41,193 --> 00:59:41,773
[SPEAKER_12]: I do have to say that.

813
00:59:41,813 --> 00:59:45,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, that one right there?

814
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,037
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Zero Zero, isn't it?

815
00:59:49,498 --> 00:59:50,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is First Battle.

816
00:59:52,049 --> 00:59:53,090
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got great music.

817
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:56,012
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing I did like about these games is it has fantastic music.

818
00:59:56,732 --> 01:00:00,694
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's just the themes are really, really dark.

819
01:00:00,754 --> 01:00:03,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakman in chat wants to know who made this game, Cheech or Chong?

820
01:00:06,198 --> 01:00:06,858
[SPEAKER_12]: That wasn't funny.

821
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:09,380
[SPEAKER_12]: It actually came out by Flight Plan.

822
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,281
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was published by Interchannel.

823
01:00:12,722 --> 01:00:15,783
[SPEAKER_12]: In case anyone actually was curious for a real reason.

824
01:00:17,524 --> 01:00:23,245
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the titles actually did get considered for a North American release.

825
01:00:23,906 --> 01:00:36,088
[SPEAKER_12]: However, because of the religious themes in it, I would actually have to say pretty sacrilegious themes in it, it got the boot.

826
01:00:36,128 --> 01:00:39,429
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we were supposed to get... Could they have just changed the art or something?

827
01:00:40,029 --> 01:00:40,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

828
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't there other ways they can kind of get around it?

829
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,944
[SPEAKER_12]: They can release anime with that.

830
01:00:44,964 --> 01:00:46,645
[SPEAKER_12]: They should be able to release a video game with that.

831
01:00:46,745 --> 01:00:48,726
[SPEAKER_12]: The Black Matrix just had a pretty interesting story.

832
01:00:49,987 --> 01:00:56,031
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, but the first one was really, in my opinion, the best because, you know, you have to work for your dominatrix mistress.

833
01:00:56,051 --> 01:00:58,713
[SPEAKER_12]: And you choose your mistress, by the way, at the beginning of the game.

834
01:01:00,686 --> 01:01:07,429
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Black Matrix.

835
01:01:07,509 --> 01:01:09,070
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Black Slash Matrix.

836
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And good luck finding that one to play.

837
01:01:12,431 --> 01:01:13,872
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a friend who's got the Saturn version.

838
01:01:14,072 --> 01:01:18,173
[SPEAKER_04]: But think about it, you'll learn Japanese while you play because it's not in English at all.

839
01:01:18,253 --> 01:01:19,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So good luck with that.

840
01:01:19,474 --> 01:01:21,695
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, but a good trip down memory lane nonetheless.

841
01:01:23,135 --> 01:01:25,697
[SPEAKER_04]: One that I'm sure most people listening probably have never heard of.

842
01:01:25,817 --> 01:01:26,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

843
01:01:27,165 --> 01:01:29,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for the first half of our show tonight.

844
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:30,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go anywhere, guys.

845
01:01:30,048 --> 01:01:32,730
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have plenty to go here tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

846
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Some rapid fire news when we get back.

847
01:01:34,451 --> 01:01:36,813
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to talk about what happened on Blizzard's call this week.

848
01:01:37,434 --> 01:01:40,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Some really interesting updates on Diablo 3 as well as World of Warcraft.

849
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Another lawsuit involving Band Hero.

850
01:01:43,959 --> 01:01:47,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're never going to believe this story about Skyrim.

851
01:01:47,342 --> 01:01:48,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually has nothing to do with the game.

852
01:01:49,484 --> 01:01:50,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wait for it.

853
01:01:50,264 --> 01:01:54,168
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

854
01:02:00,936 --> 01:02:03,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

855
01:02:03,919 --> 01:02:15,270
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live on this Sunday evening, August the 7th, if I look at my calendar right, of 2011, where we're taping the 423rd episode of our show.

856
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:16,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starting to lose count, oh my gosh.

857
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:22,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, we're going to get back into some rapid fire news tonight and do some quick stories for you guys.

858
01:02:22,296 --> 01:02:22,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, start us off.

859
01:02:23,951 --> 01:02:31,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so let's see, starting things off, let's talk a little bit about Borderlands 2, which I'm very excited that got announced.

860
01:02:31,438 --> 01:02:40,326
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be coming out sometime after March 2012, it's gonna be the next fiscal year for Take-Two, and...

861
01:02:42,128 --> 01:02:42,928
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty awesome.

862
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:46,389
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a little bit of a tease in the new Game Informer.

863
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:50,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the details have kind of leaked out about it so far.

864
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:53,451
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the new playable characters is going to be Salvador, the dwarf.

865
01:02:53,951 --> 01:03:00,213
[SPEAKER_05]: He is what they call a Gunzerker, basically a guy that's able to dual-wield weapons, which is pretty cool.

866
01:03:01,073 --> 01:03:04,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, they're saying that there's going to be better AI as well as...

867
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:13,153
[SPEAKER_05]: The old characters from the first game are going to be NPC characters in this new game.

868
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:16,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks awesome.

869
01:03:16,887 --> 01:03:18,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to check it out.

870
01:03:18,727 --> 01:03:21,929
[SPEAKER_05]: The first game was just amazing.

871
01:03:23,389 --> 01:03:27,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, DC Universe Online is doing pretty well.

872
01:03:27,491 --> 01:03:34,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, they're going to be merging some servers into mega servers, and this is going to be happening on Monday.

873
01:03:35,675 --> 01:03:38,696
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't strike me as news you hear when a game's doing well.

874
01:03:39,157 --> 01:03:39,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, whatever.

875
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:41,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Well is a subjective term.

876
01:03:41,378 --> 01:03:42,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so.

877
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:48,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, apparently, uh, they're previously hailed as super servers.

878
01:03:48,515 --> 01:03:54,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, mega servers will give the players the ability to switch, uh, between PvP and PvE styles of gameplay.

879
01:03:55,979 --> 01:03:56,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um...

880
01:03:58,672 --> 01:04:04,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I guess the last... Before it was maybe... Oh, hey, apparently we're playing listless tonight, except we're not.

881
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:05,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

882
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:09,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe before they were... You had to switch actual servers.

883
01:04:09,182 --> 01:04:11,524
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to have a player on each server in order to do that.

884
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:13,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure, but...

885
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now the servers are set to be merged into four mega servers.

886
01:04:17,722 --> 01:04:24,385
[SPEAKER_05]: One PC, one PS3 server for the US with twin servers in the European regions.

887
01:04:25,306 --> 01:04:27,747
[SPEAKER_05]: So wow, that's interesting.

888
01:04:27,787 --> 01:04:33,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess if you're playing in the US, you'll be playing with everybody in the US.

889
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:36,472
[SPEAKER_04]: All five other people that are playing DC Universe right now.

890
01:04:39,051 --> 01:05:05,144
[SPEAKER_05]: DC Universe players are going to write angry emails to the show I'm only being half serious I don't know many people at all that are playing it but obviously some people are I don't know anyone that plays EverQuest either but that game is still going although the way things are right now with all the server merges some players will be forced to change their names after the merge since two characters cannot exist with the same name on the same server

891
01:05:06,829 --> 01:05:09,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you'll have to be XXXSeparoth69XXX Yeah

892
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:23,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, the first PS3 jailbreak raid in South Africa has one man arrested.

893
01:05:25,647 --> 01:05:27,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't even know they were still going after people there.

894
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:44,199
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently they raided this guy in Parktown and confiscated $14,000 worth of computers, PS3s, hard drives, jailbreak software, USB kits, and fake PS2 games and original PS3 games.

895
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:52,382
[SPEAKER_05]: and they said one man was taken into custody at the Special Commercial Crimes Court but made bail.

896
01:05:55,043 --> 01:05:57,264
[SPEAKER_04]: What exactly is the crime that these folks are committing?

897
01:05:57,764 --> 01:05:58,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Jailbreaking the PS3.

898
01:05:58,864 --> 01:06:00,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, jailbreaking the PS3.

899
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:21,634
[SPEAKER_05]: which really shouldn't be a crime in the first place well I mean I guess it's a different country but I thought like when it came at least to this country they found in a court of law that you can jailbreak your phone well your phone yeah because that's added to like a list of devices that it's okay and legal to do that with however the Playstation 3 is not one of those devices

900
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:34,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they were hoping, you know, the whole Geohots thing, that it would actually go to trial, and he would be found, you know, innocent, which case would set a precedent that, you know, it's okay to jailbreak that stuff.

901
01:06:34,835 --> 01:06:46,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, him being a pussy also backed out of everything, and, you know, they settled that, of course, so he can get his job at Sony or whatever, and so there's no precedent set there.

902
01:06:49,284 --> 01:06:51,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think he works at Sony actually.

903
01:06:51,147 --> 01:06:53,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he works at Facebook, but who cares?

904
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:53,731
[SPEAKER_04]: He's still pussy.

905
01:06:55,814 --> 01:06:56,435
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're not mad.

906
01:06:57,437 --> 01:06:58,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't care.

907
01:06:59,418 --> 01:07:01,258
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason for me to jailbreak my PS3.

908
01:07:01,299 --> 01:07:03,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't play enough games on it.

909
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:05,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let me do some quick stories here.

910
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,920
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them has to do with that 3D TV.

911
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember this announcement at E3 from Sony?

912
01:07:09,581 --> 01:07:10,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Turned a lot of heads.

913
01:07:10,382 --> 01:07:22,165
[SPEAKER_04]: They were going to be selling a 3D TV that came with the TV, obviously, it was like a monitor, glasses, an HDMI cable, and a copy of Resistance 3, and it was all going to be $499, right?

914
01:07:22,726 --> 01:07:25,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not really going to come with Resistance 3 anymore.

915
01:07:26,787 --> 01:07:28,168
[SPEAKER_04]: That's changed a little bit.

916
01:07:28,268 --> 01:07:32,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've decided now it's going to be Motorstorm Apocalypse instead of Resistance 3.

917
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:37,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps they want folks to buy the game separately.

918
01:07:37,492 --> 01:07:38,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they don't want to be giving it away.

919
01:07:39,073 --> 01:07:44,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps that Motorstorm Apocalypse didn't sell as well as they'd planned and they are sitting on a ton of them and they need to get rid of them.

920
01:07:45,136 --> 01:07:46,776
[SPEAKER_04]: You also get a free copy of E.T.

921
01:07:46,836 --> 01:07:47,977
[SPEAKER_04]: for the Atari 2600.

922
01:07:48,037 --> 01:07:48,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure.

923
01:07:49,017 --> 01:07:50,238
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just throwing that in there for free.

924
01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:51,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how Sony got a hold of them.

925
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:53,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they moved their corporate offices to New Mexico.

926
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:54,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.

927
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:58,503
[SPEAKER_05]: In Motorstorm Apocalypse, it's sad that it didn't sell as well as they had hoped.

928
01:07:59,344 --> 01:08:00,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great game.

929
01:08:00,365 --> 01:08:04,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, I think people were hoping to get Resistance 3.

930
01:08:05,328 --> 01:08:14,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I'm not sure if it made our show roll, but if you pre-order through GameStop, you still do get Resistance 3 and Motorstorm Apocalypse.

931
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:21,101
[SPEAKER_04]: But that would require pre-ordering through GameStop And I hate them so much, I'm not going to do that Why would you pre-order a TV through GameStop?

932
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:42,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that, do not be tempted by this Amazon will match it, somebody will match it Just wait Anyhow, let's see Apparently there was a statement made to GameSpot That, not GameStop, but GameSpot I want to start a website called GamePots Because apparently there's this

933
01:08:43,314 --> 01:08:46,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Every way, which way you can rearrange that word.

934
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:50,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Motorstorm Apocalypse, it will have the full screen but split screen functionality.

935
01:08:51,267 --> 01:08:55,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that whole, you know, 3D but one person will see one screen and one will see the other?

936
01:08:55,654 --> 01:08:56,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've played that.

937
01:08:56,395 --> 01:08:57,878
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be in Motorstorm Apocalypse.

938
01:08:58,782 --> 01:09:24,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I played with MLB 11, the show, which I really didn't want to play MLB See, they had a demonstration during our little Game of Summit thing I wanted to play Motorstorm But no, the two guys working the booth decided Hey, we're a fan of baseball, we're going to play baseball It's about us, not the consumer So I played that, and it works I don't know

939
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:27,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Lollipop Chainsaw

940
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:55,412
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a partnership now with Katakawa Games that Warner Brothers will have moving forwards.

941
01:09:55,793 --> 01:09:58,179
[SPEAKER_04]: So more cheerleaders fighting more zombies.

942
01:09:58,299 --> 01:09:58,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

943
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:01,780
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

944
01:10:20,834 --> 01:10:35,722
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, quote, when we first saw and got our hands on the game, we fell in love with it That quote from Square Enix London Studios General Manager Lee Singleton It's a great big bucket of fun I think it's a good idea that they picked it up I don't know why Activision got rid of it

945
01:10:37,623 --> 01:10:39,024
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, whatever.

946
01:10:39,764 --> 01:10:42,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you might be wondering, Square Enix and True Crime?

947
01:10:42,685 --> 01:10:43,225
[SPEAKER_04]: What the heck?

948
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:44,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean Cloud is coming to the game?

949
01:10:45,086 --> 01:10:45,746
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no.

950
01:10:45,806 --> 01:10:48,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget, Square Enix now includes Eidos.

951
01:10:48,627 --> 01:10:57,270
[SPEAKER_04]: And this would not be out of the realm of possibility for, you know, that group that brought, what, Deuce X and, you know, some of those other games that now fall under the Square Enix banner.

952
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:58,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

953
01:10:58,210 --> 01:10:58,591
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

954
01:10:59,251 --> 01:10:59,831
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

955
01:11:00,603 --> 01:11:01,624
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some other stuff.

956
01:11:03,105 --> 01:11:14,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Just Dance 3 is getting a Just Create mode that lets players record their own choreography and challenge online and offline players to fit it.

957
01:11:14,494 --> 01:11:16,876
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's just practice right now.

958
01:11:18,137 --> 01:11:19,278
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a trailer out for it.

959
01:11:19,639 --> 01:11:21,720
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm ambivalent, of course.

960
01:11:23,702 --> 01:11:25,824
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have very sad news.

961
01:11:26,124 --> 01:11:27,545
[SPEAKER_12]: This makes me sniffle because...

962
01:11:29,026 --> 01:11:39,331
[SPEAKER_12]: The CEO and founder of Game Arts, Takeshi Miyagi, actually died on July 29th.

963
01:11:39,811 --> 01:11:50,577
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've reviewed a number of games that have come out of Game Arts, including Grandia, Sylphid, Lunar, and very sad.

964
01:11:50,657 --> 01:11:55,379
[SPEAKER_12]: He will be succeeded by Ryu Okoriyama, who is a CEO of Gaia Holdings.

965
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:11,870
[SPEAKER_12]: And last little bit for Rapid Fire is there are pre-order skins available for the new Batman Arkham City game that are going to be related to wherever you happen to pre-order them from and there will be download content.

966
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:17,974
[SPEAKER_12]: It hasn't said yet though if these are going to be available to everybody maybe through a purchase or whatever.

967
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:22,157
[SPEAKER_12]: But the different ones that they have is that you can have the 1970s Batman skin which

968
01:12:26,119 --> 01:12:28,900
[SPEAKER_12]: is through shop2.net and Toys R Us.

969
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Shop2.net, by the way, is a UK retailer.

970
01:12:32,942 --> 01:12:39,404
[SPEAKER_12]: You can get the Batman Beyond skin through gamestop.co.uk or mightyape.co.nz.

971
01:12:39,444 --> 01:12:41,085
[SPEAKER_12]: That's New Zealand or UK.

972
01:12:42,925 --> 01:13:10,935
[SPEAKER_12]: you also get the Dark Knight Return skin which will be if you buy it at any store if you buy the collector's edition at any store there's the animated series version that is if you get it from Mighty Apes that's again New Zealand there's Earth 1 Batman which is again through Mighty Ape and then there is the Robin Batman which is available through Best Buy or Gamesmania.be which is Holland or JB Hi-Fi for Australia I want the Adam West Batman

973
01:13:11,539 --> 01:13:11,899
[SPEAKER_12]: It's there.

974
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:12,939
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks pretty cool.

975
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:13,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

976
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:14,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do I get that?

977
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,720
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll link the picture to the chat room.

978
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but where do I get that in America?

979
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:18,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Pre-ordering that from.

980
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:21,061
[SPEAKER_12]: That one is Toys R Us.

981
01:13:21,881 --> 01:13:22,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I can do that.

982
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:24,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, the 1970s Batman.

983
01:13:24,602 --> 01:13:26,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have burning hatred for Toys R Us, so that'll work.

984
01:13:28,763 --> 01:13:30,183
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually more like the comic.

985
01:13:30,223 --> 01:13:31,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go be a Toys R Us kid.

986
01:13:31,823 --> 01:13:36,384
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more like the 1970s comic version, but that was the same as the Adam West one.

987
01:13:36,444 --> 01:13:37,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's Adam West, Batman and Me.

988
01:13:38,045 --> 01:13:38,825
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one I want to play.

989
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:41,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Except, you know, he doesn't have the drawn-on eyebrows.

990
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,761
[SPEAKER_04]: That or animated series.

991
01:13:42,841 --> 01:13:44,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the animated series one, too.

992
01:13:44,422 --> 01:13:44,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

993
01:13:44,983 --> 01:13:45,403
[SPEAKER_12]: That's in there.

994
01:13:45,663 --> 01:13:47,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say, that Michael Keaton one's kind of awesome, too.

995
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:49,346
[SPEAKER_04]: That one way on the right.

996
01:13:49,386 --> 01:13:50,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Michael Keaton, Batman?

997
01:13:50,447 --> 01:13:54,190
[SPEAKER_12]: The one on the far right is actually, I do believe, the Robin Batman.

998
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:55,851
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's on the far left, isn't it?

999
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:57,252
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's Batman Beyond.

1000
01:13:57,893 --> 01:13:58,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1001
01:13:58,513 --> 01:14:01,154
[SPEAKER_12]: So in order on this one, let me see if I get it right.

1002
01:14:01,174 --> 01:14:13,759
[SPEAKER_12]: You have from left to right, you have the Batman Beyond one, you have the Dark Knight Returns, you have Earth 1, 1970s animated series, and Robin's Batman.

1003
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Just keep in mind, Dick Grayson took over as Batman for a while.

1004
01:14:17,821 --> 01:14:24,084
[SPEAKER_05]: You know who they have, or know who one of the characters is going to be that they haven't announced yet, right?

1005
01:14:24,164 --> 01:14:26,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Nightwing, actually, is going to be one of the characters.

1006
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,081
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is shaping up to be more and more awesome.

1007
01:14:30,261 --> 01:14:31,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, then let me see something real quick.

1008
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:38,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just want to say quickly in our chat room, Breakman in the chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com says, Can I get George Clooney nipple Batman?

1009
01:14:39,386 --> 01:14:40,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I was incorrect.

1010
01:14:41,347 --> 01:14:43,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Robin gets the Red Robin skin.

1011
01:14:43,749 --> 01:14:44,429
[SPEAKER_12]: I was incorrect.

1012
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:46,750
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not the picture of it.

1013
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:47,371
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not available.

1014
01:14:47,451 --> 01:14:51,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Red Robin as in the mascot for Wonderful Burger Chain?

1015
01:14:51,693 --> 01:14:51,753
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1016
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:52,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that would be hilarious.

1017
01:14:54,955 --> 01:14:56,976
[SPEAKER_05]: That's almost as cool as Fighting is the Perfect King.

1018
01:14:58,567 --> 01:15:07,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I could support George Clooney Nipple Batman being in the game because that means that Mr. Freeze might show up and it might be really bad.

1019
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:50,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Allow me to break the ice Cold Freeze Cold Freeze Cold Frozen Ice Cold Chill Chilling Winter Ice Winter Ice Chill Cold Ice Cool Freeze Chill Freeze Winter Ice Cold Cool Ice Frost Winter Ice Freezing Ice Cool Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Freeze Let's

1020
01:15:51,786 --> 01:15:52,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Kick some ice!

1021
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,354
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, some quick plugs.

1022
01:16:23,394 --> 01:16:30,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out one of our other shows we produce, The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, www.hordehouse.com.

1023
01:16:30,638 --> 01:16:39,543
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all things World of Warcraft, which, funny enough, we're actually getting into a couple Blizzard stories coming up here, but there are things that go beyond just WoW and possibly affecting some other games, too.

1024
01:16:39,623 --> 01:16:41,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little bit of a crossover tonight going on.

1025
01:16:41,804 --> 01:16:42,585
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1026
01:16:58,483 --> 01:17:02,225
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hoping to talk to some indie developers and spotlight more indie games here on the show.

1027
01:17:02,545 --> 01:17:08,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, we've talked a lot about the Humble Indie Bundle tonight, which is a great place to start, but we want to try and talk to some of the developers themselves.

1028
01:17:08,928 --> 01:17:24,254
[SPEAKER_04]: If you or anyone you know is developing an indie game, either for the PC, a homebrew thing, maybe for the iOS or Xbox Live independent games, I know it's very hard to stand out on Xbox Live, that's for sure, so come get some exposure on Orange Lounge Radio.

1029
01:17:24,314 --> 01:17:25,375
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't charge for it.

1030
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:27,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I made that clear last week, but it's...

1031
01:17:27,956 --> 01:17:31,517
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do it because we like your game, not because we're getting any money off it.

1032
01:17:31,877 --> 01:17:33,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So email us.

1033
01:17:33,557 --> 01:17:40,138
[SPEAKER_04]: You can email the show at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or you can get in contact with us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

1034
01:17:40,378 --> 01:17:44,119
[SPEAKER_04]: You can email me directly if you want, rob at orangeloungeradio.com because I'll be producing the new segment.

1035
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:45,659
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be fun.

1036
01:17:46,779 --> 01:17:47,799
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

1037
01:17:47,839 --> 01:17:49,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some other news.

1038
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mentioned Blizzard a minute ago.

1039
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,341
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some big stuff that came out of Blizzard on an earnings call this week, right, Loki?

1040
01:17:55,361 --> 01:17:55,741
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just...

1041
01:17:56,741 --> 01:18:00,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Where Blizzard goes, the industry may in fact follow, correct?

1042
01:18:01,447 --> 01:18:06,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so they announced a few things about Diablo 3.

1043
01:18:08,315 --> 01:18:16,564
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, Diablo 3 is going to feature player-to-player real money auction houses for virtual items.

1044
01:18:17,405 --> 01:18:27,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you're going to be able to play this game, find items or whatever, and then sell them for real money, or I think in-game currency as well.

1045
01:18:28,135 --> 01:18:29,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you'll be given the option either.

1046
01:18:29,857 --> 01:18:31,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And Blizzard will take fixed fees.

1047
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:34,581
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't say what it is, but they'll be nominal.

1048
01:18:35,402 --> 01:18:35,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

1049
01:18:38,354 --> 01:18:41,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of the sale price, both when the auction goes up for sale and when it's sold.

1050
01:18:42,975 --> 01:18:58,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when an item is sold, players will be able to keep their money in a Battle.net account for spending on Blizzard products and services or cashed out entirely with another percentage-based fee, although not yet announced third-party payment provider.

1051
01:19:00,561 --> 01:19:00,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1052
01:19:03,263 --> 01:19:04,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's interesting.

1053
01:19:05,986 --> 01:19:12,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, if that's not good enough, Diablo 3 is going to require a permanent online connection.

1054
01:19:13,535 --> 01:19:14,877
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1055
01:19:15,758 --> 01:19:22,025
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to be able to play the single player portion of the game unless you are connected to Battle.net.

1056
01:19:25,206 --> 01:19:37,650
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that they felt was really important was that if you did play offline, you start a character, you get them all the way to level 20 or 30 or 40 or what have you, and then at some point you might decide to venture onto Battle.net.

1057
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:47,733
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you had to start a character from scratch, because there's no way for us to guarantee no cheats were involved, if we let you play on the client and then take the character online.

1058
01:19:48,873 --> 01:19:54,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, their whole thing is, if you're connected to Battle.net, there must be no way that you can cheat at all.

1059
01:19:57,276 --> 01:20:00,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it certainly would be a lot harder, that's for sure.

1060
01:20:00,499 --> 01:20:07,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, exploits will be found in the game one way or another, but this is tricky.

1061
01:20:07,325 --> 01:20:11,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I have to watch Blizzard very closely because I spend a lot of time playing World of Warcraft.

1062
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:15,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I will buy Diablo 3 because I loved Diablo 2.

1063
01:20:15,673 --> 01:20:21,759
[SPEAKER_04]: In some ways, the reason why I like World of Warcraft so much is that it almost plays more like Diablo than it does the RTS Warcraft games.

1064
01:20:23,621 --> 01:20:27,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is all news that definitely impacts, relevant to my interests as they say.

1065
01:20:29,088 --> 01:20:39,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think a large part of what they're doing with the online connectivity and the fact that they say you can't cheat or whatever is that they do have huge problems in Diablo 2.

1066
01:20:40,663 --> 01:20:53,127
[SPEAKER_04]: with folks cloning items and buying characters that are made in China and so forth by shady ways, getting the characters all leveled up.

1067
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:56,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheating, duping is a huge thing, and hacking and so forth.

1068
01:20:56,289 --> 01:21:01,490
[SPEAKER_04]: That game has been hacked to shit, and it makes a lot of people not want to play online because the experience is just screwed up.

1069
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:08,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about if that becomes a problem, it's going to screw up their entire game because, yeah, okay, we're assuming that

1070
01:21:09,233 --> 01:21:16,096
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making the assumption that if it's connected to the Battle.net all the time, that's going to eliminate cheating.

1071
01:21:17,776 --> 01:21:19,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's possible.

1072
01:21:19,297 --> 01:21:21,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to eliminate cheating, but it's going to cut it way, way, way back.

1073
01:21:21,798 --> 01:21:26,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're going to have a problem, though, with people if they're duplicating items and they're selling them for real money.

1074
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:31,582
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not going to be able to duplicate items because they're always connected, and the system's going to look out for that shit and ban them instantly.

1075
01:21:31,662 --> 01:21:32,282
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

1076
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:36,203
[SPEAKER_04]: The real problem is people that buy this shit.

1077
01:21:36,523 --> 01:21:42,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you buy gold for these games or you bought one of these characters, you're part of the reason this is happening.

1078
01:21:42,605 --> 01:21:43,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's be real.

1079
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:47,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've probably had your credit card stolen too because a lot of those companies like to do both.

1080
01:21:48,587 --> 01:21:51,788
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell you the info and then sell your credit card information to somebody else.

1081
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:53,229
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.

1082
01:21:53,949 --> 01:21:54,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes you happy I guess.

1083
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:57,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1084
01:21:57,551 --> 01:22:03,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the whole real money auction house thing is just the weirdest thing I've ever heard in my life.

1085
01:22:04,034 --> 01:22:11,337
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, if people weren't buying this shit somewhere else, they wouldn't have to do something like this, I guess.

1086
01:22:11,398 --> 01:22:13,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're just trying to get a slice of it.

1087
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:15,199
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the weird thing about it for me.

1088
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, A, I'm never gonna use it.

1089
01:22:17,301 --> 01:22:20,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not use the real money auction house because I don't really want to support it.

1090
01:22:20,982 --> 01:22:22,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And A, I don't want to buy this stuff on there.

1091
01:22:23,003 --> 01:22:23,904
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems ridiculous.

1092
01:22:24,464 --> 01:22:27,427
[SPEAKER_04]: and B, Blizzard's going to charge a listing fee if you sell.

1093
01:22:28,107 --> 01:22:31,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of me wonders if Blizzard isn't going to profit off false dreams.

1094
01:22:32,651 --> 01:22:36,534
[SPEAKER_04]: That they're going to profit off people trying to list all these items for sale that will never sell.

1095
01:22:37,274 --> 01:22:40,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people that are saying, yeah, I'll sell items on there and make money.

1096
01:22:41,297 --> 01:22:44,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't hear anyone say, I'll buy the items off there and make money.

1097
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's some other things that you need to consider too.

1098
01:22:48,503 --> 01:22:48,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1099
01:22:53,487 --> 01:22:55,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I can guarantee it's not an in-game currency.

1100
01:22:57,571 --> 01:23:00,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means you're going to have to have your credit card in there somewhere.

1101
01:23:03,456 --> 01:23:04,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's not a big deal.

1102
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:31,542
[SPEAKER_04]: that let's say hypothetically somebody could sell enough items that they make a significant amount of money on this.

1103
01:23:31,562 --> 01:23:38,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anybody's going to make more than maybe $20 on this stuff, but let's say somebody does make a fair amount of money off some of these items.

1104
01:23:39,745 --> 01:23:42,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't they have to claim taxes on that at some point?

1105
01:23:42,846 --> 01:23:47,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't forms have to be filed by Blizzard or I guess whoever their third party is that they're going to get involved on some of that?

1106
01:23:47,988 --> 01:23:49,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you be taxed on not real items?

1107
01:23:50,749 --> 01:23:53,990
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where the whole internet gambling thing comes into play is that

1108
01:23:54,750 --> 01:24:03,254
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no... I mean, Blizzard controls the drop rate of these items that they're then going to turn around and charge you to sell.

1109
01:24:03,394 --> 01:24:06,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about that seems really devious to me.

1110
01:24:07,596 --> 01:24:08,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there's not a...

1111
01:24:10,017 --> 01:24:18,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Check and balance to that Like Blizzard is gonna control It's insider trading Yeah, that's what it is, it's insider trading Like, that's legal?

1112
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:35,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I think it's only legal because it hasn't really been done yet But I think this is gonna catch somebody's eye This is gonna catch the eye of a Leland Yee or somebody out there That's wanting, you know, the same way online gambling did It just doesn't add up to me

1113
01:24:38,637 --> 01:24:43,261
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob, this is the same company that got a ton of suckers to pay $20 for a dumb mount.

1114
01:24:43,462 --> 01:24:44,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, true.

1115
01:24:44,943 --> 01:24:45,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Very true.

1116
01:24:46,704 --> 01:24:48,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I never bought the dumb mount, just so you know.

1117
01:24:48,206 --> 01:24:49,767
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I ever bought were the charity pets.

1118
01:24:50,147 --> 01:24:54,351
[SPEAKER_04]: They were charity, just so you know.

1119
01:24:54,431 --> 01:25:01,137
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know some people who did buy those mounts, and they quite enjoy them.

1120
01:25:01,177 --> 01:25:02,138
[SPEAKER_04]: They spend a lot of money on them.

1121
01:25:03,747 --> 01:25:08,150
[SPEAKER_04]: and at the same time, I'm not going to tell a person what they should and shouldn't spend their money on to make them happy, right?

1122
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:13,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And if a fake little star pony that flies makes you happy, then go for it.

1123
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't pay for tower bucks and tiny tower either, but I still play the game.

1124
01:25:20,499 --> 01:25:20,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1125
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:33,647
[SPEAKER_04]: DungeonBuster says, I'm surprised that they didn't opt to let players into making a separate profile for off and online play.

1126
01:25:34,448 --> 01:25:40,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too, but maybe they were worried about things like blurring the lines or whatever and leave it open to abuse.

1127
01:25:41,756 --> 01:25:54,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Slaces Pop in chat says, that issue has come up before with Second Life where people were making tangible income for digital goods on their skins, house, digital assets design that they put the time into making and then selling on PayPal.

1128
01:25:54,527 --> 01:25:58,010
[SPEAKER_04]: The IRS had no idea what to do with it, but you can look up news articles about it.

1129
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:00,312
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a big deal when Second Life was still relevant.

1130
01:26:01,753 --> 01:26:02,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1131
01:26:03,554 --> 01:26:06,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm really interested to see where this goes.

1132
01:26:06,655 --> 01:26:06,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1133
01:26:06,975 --> 01:26:10,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's my thing, and this is with the whole IRS stuff.

1134
01:26:10,537 --> 01:26:17,339
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're going to tax you on in-game currency that you make, then I should be able to pay those taxes with in-game currency.

1135
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:19,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's always been the problem.

1136
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:21,841
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to associate a value to this stuff.

1137
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:27,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Say, for example, I sell some items in Diablo 3 and earn...

1138
01:26:30,634 --> 01:26:34,980
[SPEAKER_05]: 20,000 Blizzard Space Bucks or whatever they're gonna be under there.

1139
01:26:35,641 --> 01:26:40,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And then somehow that translates to $15,000 or something like that.

1140
01:26:40,669 --> 01:26:42,752
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I never cash that stuff out, I mean...

1141
01:26:43,897 --> 01:26:44,637
[SPEAKER_05]: It's digital.

1142
01:26:45,037 --> 01:26:47,358
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really worth that kind of money.

1143
01:26:47,478 --> 01:26:51,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, but if they're going to charge me that, then why should I have to pay in real money?

1144
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,781
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not real money, then I'm earning, you know what I mean?

1145
01:26:55,862 --> 01:26:58,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, keep in mind there are the two completely separate auction houses.

1146
01:26:59,203 --> 01:27:02,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's going to be the auction house that runs completely off in-game currency.

1147
01:27:02,644 --> 01:27:03,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll use that.

1148
01:27:03,665 --> 01:27:04,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1149
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:05,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I use it in WoW.

1150
01:27:05,325 --> 01:27:06,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great system.

1151
01:27:06,506 --> 01:27:06,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

1152
01:27:07,486 --> 01:27:07,746
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1153
01:27:23,618 --> 01:27:24,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1154
01:27:39,534 --> 01:27:40,775
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1155
01:28:03,596 --> 01:28:05,477
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you're mad, because you can't cheat.

1156
01:28:05,497 --> 01:28:06,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm not mad.

1157
01:28:06,617 --> 01:28:09,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that it's a bold statement to say that you can't cheat.

1158
01:28:10,299 --> 01:28:11,880
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no can't, okay?

1159
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:12,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It will happen.

1160
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:13,941
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a way.

1161
01:28:16,431 --> 01:28:17,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they'll be like, we ban you!

1162
01:28:20,214 --> 01:28:26,940
[SPEAKER_04]: You banned me from Diablo!

1163
01:28:28,061 --> 01:28:29,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Do people still do that?

1164
01:28:30,343 --> 01:28:30,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so.

1165
01:28:30,983 --> 01:28:31,764
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my plan.

1166
01:28:32,725 --> 01:28:35,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really want to play Diablo 3 with strangers either.

1167
01:28:35,087 --> 01:28:36,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be playing co-op with friends.

1168
01:28:37,269 --> 01:28:37,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

1169
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:41,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe OLR people would count as friends if you wanted to play Diablo 3.

1170
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:43,554
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd go on a co-op mission together.

1171
01:28:44,687 --> 01:28:45,668
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1172
01:29:06,104 --> 01:29:12,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Blizzard... Diablo isn't really something I'd want to try and play on the go anyway, or somewhere that I can't have an internet connection.

1173
01:29:13,089 --> 01:29:15,291
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have internet connections on planes now, you know?

1174
01:29:16,211 --> 01:29:16,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1175
01:29:16,772 --> 01:29:19,534
[SPEAKER_04]: But not an internet connection to run that game.

1176
01:29:19,774 --> 01:29:22,716
[SPEAKER_04]: But I get... I am being a little bit of a hypocrite.

1177
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:23,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

1178
01:29:23,416 --> 01:29:30,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I admit that, because I'm okay with what Blizzard's doing here, but yet I'm not okay with Ubisoft doing it with Driver.

1179
01:29:30,762 --> 01:29:31,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's ridiculous.

1180
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:33,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

1181
01:29:34,424 --> 01:30:01,992
[SPEAKER_04]: from what I understand the single player of Driver doesn't have any online elements the single player version of this game now does have a real money auction house involved where people could be making money off of it and I guess they've got to protect the environment and heaven forbid somebody does cheat and now this turns into like real money that's when it's going to be a legal problem Blizzard better hope that having everybody connected 24-7 really does keep out the cheaters and they better really be watching that shit like a hawk

1182
01:30:02,412 --> 01:30:05,915
[SPEAKER_04]: because if somebody's able to exploit that real money system, it's over.

1183
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:07,256
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1184
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:09,337
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

1185
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:11,599
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1186
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:15,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to news that came out about the next WoW expansion.

1187
01:30:16,443 --> 01:30:18,445
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura, I know, right?

1188
01:30:18,825 --> 01:30:19,946
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been playing this for a while.

1189
01:30:21,067 --> 01:30:21,607
[SPEAKER_04]: The rumor.

1190
01:30:23,609 --> 01:30:25,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I laugh every time I think about it.

1191
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:34,403
[SPEAKER_04]: The name, apparently, that has been registered for the next expansion verified by MMO Trampion with trademarks and so forth is Mists of Pandaria.

1192
01:30:34,503 --> 01:30:34,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Mop.

1193
01:30:36,144 --> 01:30:37,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the Mop expansion.

1194
01:30:38,004 --> 01:30:41,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Pandarias, of course, are named for the Pandaren.

1195
01:30:41,765 --> 01:30:48,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Living, breathing, walking, talking panda bears that made their way into WoW culture as part of an April Fool's joke and never left.

1196
01:30:49,587 --> 01:30:50,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can't get the Pandaren Monk.

1197
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:54,649
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the charity pets that actually they sold there.

1198
01:30:56,069 --> 01:31:03,112
[SPEAKER_04]: The trademark was apparently registered July 28th, and it could be that this is going to be out in time for BlizzCon.

1199
01:31:03,312 --> 01:31:06,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the expansion itself, but more news on it will come out at BlizzCon.

1200
01:31:08,274 --> 01:31:14,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that the rumors say Pandarins will be a playable race, that you'll get to go to level 90, of course.

1201
01:31:14,717 --> 01:31:16,077
[SPEAKER_04]: A monk hero class.

1202
01:31:16,877 --> 01:31:18,318
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, panda bears are all monks.

1203
01:31:19,506 --> 01:31:22,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we had some discussion on this in guild chat not too long ago.

1204
01:31:25,049 --> 01:31:30,653
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, I believe that Miklatov was amongst the people because that's who I heard about it from.

1205
01:31:32,014 --> 01:31:38,998
[SPEAKER_12]: But we were talking about other possibilities that it could be like the ruins of the Pandaren Empire.

1206
01:31:39,478 --> 01:31:44,041
[SPEAKER_12]: That perhaps there's only a few left and you learn to become a monk from one of them.

1207
01:31:44,261 --> 01:31:45,522
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we just got new races.

1208
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:52,965
[SPEAKER_12]: So it could just be that you're exploring their culture like they're... Who are the freaking Walrus people again?

1209
01:31:53,365 --> 01:31:53,966
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kaluak.

1210
01:31:54,246 --> 01:31:55,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I like the Walrus people.

1211
01:31:56,489 --> 01:31:56,869
[SPEAKER_12]: They're cool.

1212
01:31:56,909 --> 01:31:58,511
[SPEAKER_12]: They remind me of Wilford Brimley.

1213
01:31:59,492 --> 01:32:01,174
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they all look like Wilford Brimley.

1214
01:32:01,454 --> 01:32:01,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

1215
01:32:03,976 --> 01:32:13,762
[SPEAKER_12]: But, um, I mean, it could be that, you know, you just get to visit the Pandarens and you learn from them so you get a monk class and maybe, like you were saying, level 90.

1216
01:32:15,383 --> 01:32:17,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, you know, we get more goody items.

1217
01:32:17,464 --> 01:32:24,289
[SPEAKER_12]: But, I mean, I would personally like to, you know, have another reason to do five more levels worth of quests.

1218
01:32:24,729 --> 01:32:24,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Ugh.

1219
01:32:26,132 --> 01:32:30,355
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite theory about this, though, is that this is just a Facebook or an iOS game.

1220
01:32:30,655 --> 01:32:31,576
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a spin-off game.

1221
01:32:31,756 --> 01:32:33,177
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I hope that's the case.

1222
01:32:33,837 --> 01:32:35,398
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be much more understandable.

1223
01:32:35,818 --> 01:32:36,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1224
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:39,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay with the whole archaeology idea.

1225
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:44,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I call that the archaeology concept, that you're trying to figure out why the Pandarens got, you know, all murdered.

1226
01:32:45,104 --> 01:32:48,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't want to see everybody playing a walking, talking panda bear because that's getting a little ridiculous.

1227
01:32:49,006 --> 01:32:51,567
[SPEAKER_12]: I really don't think that we're going to get them as a race.

1228
01:32:52,087 --> 01:33:03,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, I mean, it's like every even-numbered expansion now has, I mean, there's only been four versions, has had a new race added.

1229
01:33:04,653 --> 01:33:06,894
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a new area.

1230
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:06,994
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1231
01:33:07,794 --> 01:33:13,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Each one's had a new area open, so I think that this one's just going to be a new area and a new... Because, alright, let me look at it better.

1232
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Just real quick, Mikulatov's correcting me in chat.

1233
01:33:15,822 --> 01:33:17,703
[SPEAKER_04]: The Walrus people are the Tuskar.

1234
01:33:17,763 --> 01:33:18,224
[SPEAKER_12]: The Tuskar.

1235
01:33:18,284 --> 01:33:20,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the Kalawak is the faction.

1236
01:33:20,746 --> 01:33:21,447
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad!

1237
01:33:23,684 --> 01:33:30,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, we got the first one introducing the world and everything, blah, blah, blah, boring, because it was.

1238
01:33:31,492 --> 01:33:34,955
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you get the Burning Crusades.

1239
01:33:35,055 --> 01:33:37,477
[SPEAKER_12]: You get two new races, one for each side.

1240
01:33:37,717 --> 01:33:39,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Demons, demons, and more demons.

1241
01:33:41,901 --> 01:33:43,163
[SPEAKER_12]: You get space goats.

1242
01:33:45,004 --> 01:33:46,346
[SPEAKER_12]: And pretty blood elves.

1243
01:33:46,386 --> 01:33:48,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're fighting demons and fire.

1244
01:33:50,226 --> 01:33:51,306
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the Burning Legion?

1245
01:33:51,486 --> 01:33:52,527
[SPEAKER_04]: And you had to learn to fly.

1246
01:33:52,927 --> 01:33:53,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1247
01:33:53,587 --> 01:33:56,668
[SPEAKER_04]: The Burning Legion sounds like something you have to take antibiotics for.

1248
01:33:57,408 --> 01:33:58,028
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a salve.

1249
01:33:59,288 --> 01:34:03,469
[SPEAKER_12]: And okay, the next one you get basically a new character class and a new area.

1250
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:09,991
[SPEAKER_12]: So then when we get Cataclysm, it was against new races and a new area.

1251
01:34:10,191 --> 01:34:12,612
[SPEAKER_12]: And the whole world gets fucked up and the game gets made fun.

1252
01:34:12,632 --> 01:34:13,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1253
01:34:13,772 --> 01:34:21,638
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would logically stand to reason that if they're establishing a pattern, then you'll be getting a new area and a new class.

1254
01:34:22,259 --> 01:34:26,702
[SPEAKER_12]: And it could possibly be... Okay, what was the level cap for...

1255
01:34:28,661 --> 01:34:29,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Wrath of the Lich King?

1256
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:31,082
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Burning Crusade.

1257
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:31,082
70.

1258
01:34:32,122 --> 01:34:38,463
[SPEAKER_12]: 70.

1259
01:34:32,662 --> 01:34:38,463
[SPEAKER_12]: You start off with a 55 character coming from a level 70 cap.

1260
01:34:39,463 --> 01:34:45,705
[SPEAKER_12]: So given that the current cap right now is 85, I would think that maybe monks start off as a level 70 or something like that.

1261
01:34:46,285 --> 01:34:47,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you know what else Wrath of the Lich King had?

1262
01:34:48,605 --> 01:34:51,046
[SPEAKER_04]: It had lots and lots and tons and tons of ice.

1263
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:53,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow me to break the ice.

1264
01:34:54,326 --> 01:34:55,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Cold freeze.

1265
01:34:55,907 --> 01:34:57,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Cold freeze.

1266
01:35:01,592 --> 01:35:03,454
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually the Lich King.

1267
01:35:05,075 --> 01:35:05,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking.

1268
01:35:06,156 --> 01:35:07,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Arthur's that bitch.

1269
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:11,441
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to draw that, you know.

1270
01:35:12,442 --> 01:35:12,622
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1271
01:35:13,095 --> 01:35:14,116
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1272
01:35:34,867 --> 01:35:38,188
[SPEAKER_12]: It was some... Well, of course, somebody in our guild said it was all those cookies.

1273
01:35:39,428 --> 01:35:40,428
[SPEAKER_12]: That Arthas likes cookies.

1274
01:35:40,488 --> 01:35:46,370
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was going to draw a picture of Arthas lounged out like Jabba the Hutt eating cookies.

1275
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:48,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Saying, let's kick some ice.

1276
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:50,031
[SPEAKER_12]: I should do that.

1277
01:35:50,971 --> 01:35:51,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1278
01:35:52,631 --> 01:35:55,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So Pandaria, yay or nay?

1279
01:35:57,603 --> 01:35:59,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm all for something new.

1280
01:35:59,445 --> 01:35:59,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1281
01:36:00,065 --> 01:36:02,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard's going to do what they're going to do and I can't really control it.

1282
01:36:02,487 --> 01:36:06,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Firelands has been kind of burn depressing.

1283
01:36:07,403 --> 01:36:19,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, they can send us to, you know, they can send us to play with... To the land of P. We can go to Keyboard Cat who lives in the land of P, P, P, P, P. I don't really care.

1284
01:36:19,888 --> 01:36:33,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, as long as it doesn't have that horribly steep curve into raiding and doing all that stuff that Cataclysm did, as long as it's more accessible, I think as long as it just plays more like Wrath of the Lich King, to be honest, I think it'll be fine.

1285
01:36:34,574 --> 01:36:34,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Well...

1286
01:36:37,593 --> 01:36:39,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that I'm raiding, I really like it.

1287
01:36:39,777 --> 01:36:45,127
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that more people, it should definitely, there should be, maybe they'll incorporate easier raids.

1288
01:36:46,329 --> 01:36:47,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, beginning raids.

1289
01:36:48,991 --> 01:37:18,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov in chat says I don't get all the hate for this being a possible expansion I think it's neat that they are thinking of doing something completely not related to anything currently in the lore of the game makes it the most exciting part to me like I'm with you Miklatov take exactly what you say and I'm with you but then you have to remember we're talking about panda bears that started as an April Fool's joke being that new part of the lore like that's why I'm like do not want

1290
01:37:18,884 --> 01:37:19,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I like panda bears.

1291
01:37:20,786 --> 01:37:25,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't like them that much or I need them in my warcraft, you know?

1292
01:37:25,249 --> 01:37:31,854
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe the pandarins are actually a magical illusion of panda bears and they really look like, not like space goats.

1293
01:37:33,939 --> 01:37:35,960
[SPEAKER_12]: For the record, Space Goats are the best.

1294
01:38:02,202 --> 01:38:03,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to the email bag, though.

1295
01:38:03,603 --> 01:38:10,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Every week you email us, and we might read them here on air.

1296
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:12,730
[SPEAKER_04]: If DarkSakura's feeling saucy.

1297
01:38:14,271 --> 01:38:14,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Or burpy.

1298
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I didn't have the mic up.

1299
01:38:17,133 --> 01:38:19,295
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to read some emails for you right now.

1300
01:38:19,315 --> 01:38:20,075
[SPEAKER_12]: You better be nice to me.

1301
01:38:20,115 --> 01:38:20,976
[SPEAKER_12]: I gave you ice cream.

1302
01:38:21,256 --> 01:38:22,017
[SPEAKER_04]: You did give me ice cream.

1303
01:38:22,077 --> 01:38:22,637
[SPEAKER_04]: It was delicious.

1304
01:38:22,978 --> 01:38:24,679
[SPEAKER_12]: I found Samoa's ice cream.

1305
01:38:24,839 --> 01:38:26,020
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really fucking good, y'all.

1306
01:38:26,972 --> 01:38:28,433
[SPEAKER_12]: So the first email here.

1307
01:38:29,234 --> 01:38:33,997
[SPEAKER_12]: While looking at the disused televisions in the basement, I was inspired to ask again, Jamie.

1308
01:38:34,097 --> 01:38:34,658
[SPEAKER_12]: That was to me.

1309
01:38:35,218 --> 01:38:37,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Does the Vault have a collection of older television sets as well?

1310
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:38,600
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1311
01:38:40,462 --> 01:38:46,406
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure someone has to make adapters to hook up Atari 2600 or Odyssey to HDMI, but do you prefer the original sets?

1312
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:47,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

1313
01:38:48,328 --> 01:38:54,216
[SPEAKER_12]: The only way I can really play the Odyssey is to get up to the original sets, but all of our other systems will work with the modern TVs.

1314
01:38:55,578 --> 01:38:56,820
[SPEAKER_12]: They make different adapters.

1315
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:59,383
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't have to use the little prongs to make it work.

1316
01:38:59,744 --> 01:39:04,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, can't you get an RF adapter at Radio Shack that will change it to RC?

1317
01:39:05,491 --> 01:39:07,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you can get an adapter.

1318
01:39:07,052 --> 01:39:19,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Just the one problem is that I think actually since the Odyssey was from, I want to say like 81 or something like that, there's no way to make it work with a newer TV.

1319
01:39:20,555 --> 01:39:25,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I think you might expose yourself to some shitty lag if you use the converters.

1320
01:39:25,637 --> 01:39:30,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really do this in my house, so I couldn't tell you, but I think you do open yourself up to lag issues.

1321
01:39:31,223 --> 01:39:32,444
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1322
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:55,885
[SPEAKER_12]: That they were Xbox 360 demo units.

1323
01:39:57,026 --> 01:39:58,087
[SPEAKER_12]: We got monitors from them.

1324
01:39:58,888 --> 01:40:00,950
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what we have hooked up with a couple of switch boxes.

1325
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:06,616
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have about eight systems hooked up in the other room.

1326
01:40:06,897 --> 01:40:07,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Eight or nine.

1327
01:40:07,637 --> 01:40:08,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Something like that.

1328
01:40:08,839 --> 01:40:10,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Hooked up to these TVs.

1329
01:40:11,949 --> 01:40:17,916
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, really, to be honest, we have two games on the Odyssey that I really have an interest in playing.

1330
01:40:18,317 --> 01:40:19,859
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't really bother hooking it up.

1331
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:22,642
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, like I said, we don't have anything to hook it up to.

1332
01:40:23,243 --> 01:40:24,645
[SPEAKER_12]: All the other ones, no problem.

1333
01:40:24,665 --> 01:40:26,067
[SPEAKER_12]: We can hook them up to just about anything.

1334
01:40:26,127 --> 01:40:27,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Although I really do think that...

1335
01:40:28,489 --> 01:40:32,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I don't think that we've tried the Atari on an HDTV.

1336
01:40:33,310 --> 01:40:37,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that last time we played one of our Ataris, we actually did have a CRT.

1337
01:40:38,372 --> 01:40:38,632
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh well.

1338
01:40:39,372 --> 01:40:43,193
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not like it's that hard to go find a CRT monitor anymore.

1339
01:40:44,573 --> 01:40:46,394
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I can go to the thrift store.

1340
01:40:46,634 --> 01:40:47,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh look, a TV.

1341
01:40:47,614 --> 01:40:48,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Rabbit ears.

1342
01:40:49,597 --> 01:41:03,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, I apologize for any confusion about last week's email regarding the voices of multiplayer games My use of the term character was somewhat misleading I meant specifically the volumes of online players speaking through their player characters not those of the NPCs Thanks again, Robert M

1343
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:06,861
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we did address that, though.

1344
01:41:08,783 --> 01:41:20,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we were leaning towards the NPC answer, but I thought I had brought up something that the characters did sound further away, but I can't remember off the top of my head what it was.

1345
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:26,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, a lot of MMOs, you don't really do voice chat through the MMO itself.

1346
01:41:27,404 --> 01:41:30,886
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are actually kind of hard to find, the games where that happens.

1347
01:41:31,006 --> 01:41:34,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, yes, you have voice chat in WoW, but nobody uses it.

1348
01:41:35,009 --> 01:41:36,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, nobody uses it.

1349
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:38,271
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't even know it was there.

1350
01:41:39,032 --> 01:41:40,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not in the public chat channels anyway.

1351
01:41:42,774 --> 01:41:43,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1352
01:41:43,134 --> 01:41:44,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, we have one from Silk.

1353
01:41:45,854 --> 01:41:46,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Ready?

1354
01:41:47,595 --> 01:41:47,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1355
01:42:06,304 --> 01:42:10,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, I started to play this game and even if it is an older game, I really love the story.

1356
01:42:10,887 --> 01:42:17,012
[SPEAKER_12]: The options where you can choose how to respond and that it actually has an effect on the story of the game is something that I really enjoy.

1357
01:42:17,412 --> 01:42:20,834
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes me want to replay the game and try different things just to see how the story changes.

1358
01:42:21,355 --> 01:42:30,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Perhaps I'm also just happy to see some proper blood-sucking vampires instead of the woo me and my curse and stare at you while you're sleeping glittery twats that seem to be ruling the media now.

1359
01:42:30,701 --> 01:42:31,182
[SPEAKER_12]: I love her.

1360
01:42:33,023 --> 01:42:35,685
[SPEAKER_12]: For the record, the email's titled non-sparkly vampires.

1361
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:43,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you ever start playing a game thinking it would be okay, but nothing mind-blowing, but the more you played it, the more you loved it?

1362
01:42:44,395 --> 01:42:45,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Guardian Legend?

1363
01:42:46,416 --> 01:42:49,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Because when you start playing that game, it's like, oh, I'm shooting shit.

1364
01:42:49,358 --> 01:42:50,259
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoa, there's an RPG!

1365
01:42:53,734 --> 01:43:01,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you ever started a game thinking that it would be okay but nothing mind-blowing, but the more you played it, the more you loved it?

1366
01:43:02,662 --> 01:43:07,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Final Fantasy XIII No, but those games I kind of already had the bar set high.

1367
01:43:07,687 --> 01:43:09,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really trying to think of something kind of outside the norm.

1368
01:43:10,469 --> 01:43:11,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me think on that for a minute.

1369
01:43:13,336 --> 01:43:37,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think of any others actually when I got back into WoW yeah I gotta say World of Warcraft actually kind of jumps out at me when I first played WoW I didn't think it was really all that and I didn't think I was going to get that into it but you know when all my friends were playing and it became a lot more of a chat room with fire spells and swords so to speak I think that was actually a game for me when I started questing

1370
01:43:39,681 --> 01:43:42,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you could say VVVVV that I played this week.

1371
01:43:42,564 --> 01:43:44,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think I was going to like it as much as I did.

1372
01:43:46,167 --> 01:43:49,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I knew I was going to like Portal 2, but I didn't know that I'd like it as much as I did.

1373
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:53,413
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of games.

1374
01:43:53,973 --> 01:43:56,556
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm still loving this show and I'm still waiting for my biscuits, Rob.

1375
01:43:58,037 --> 01:43:58,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll work on that.

1376
01:43:58,897 --> 01:44:00,239
[SPEAKER_04]: They're with the tea and crumpets.

1377
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:02,180
[SPEAKER_12]: P.S.

1378
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,642
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're an MMO player, you'll love the attached image, I hope.

1379
01:44:04,742 --> 01:44:05,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, let's have a look.

1380
01:44:07,011 --> 01:44:08,672
[SPEAKER_12]: The Nine Circles of MMO Hell.

1381
01:44:09,412 --> 01:44:09,752
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

1382
01:44:09,792 --> 01:44:13,394
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually going to save this and post it on our Tumblr.

1383
01:44:13,474 --> 01:44:15,315
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1384
01:44:15,776 --> 01:44:18,357
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLawnsRadio.tumblr.com Image.

1385
01:44:19,137 --> 01:44:20,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll do MMO Hell.

1386
01:44:20,998 --> 01:44:22,699
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it after the mailbag segment.

1387
01:44:22,959 --> 01:44:25,060
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saving the image because I'm going to close the email.

1388
01:44:26,561 --> 01:44:28,082
[SPEAKER_12]: So, bite my behind, Rob.

1389
01:44:29,282 --> 01:44:29,583
[SPEAKER_12]: You ready?

1390
01:44:30,543 --> 01:44:31,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Newsflash!

1391
01:44:31,964 --> 01:44:33,565
[SPEAKER_12]: The Tester Season 3 is casting.

1392
01:44:33,645 --> 01:44:34,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Info below.

1393
01:44:34,365 --> 01:44:35,666
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be watching, not auditioning.

1394
01:44:35,706 --> 01:44:36,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Robaba.

1395
01:44:36,764 --> 01:44:43,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, I heard about this on Twitter this week and I sent it over to LokiOLR and I was like, Loki, weren't you saying something about you'd like to try a new career?

1396
01:44:43,792 --> 01:44:50,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I will link it in the chat room and if any of you make it on there, plug the crap out of us.

1397
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:52,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I want to say...

1398
01:44:54,356 --> 01:44:58,522
[SPEAKER_04]: They were saying that the prize for the winner this season isn't like a testing thing.

1399
01:44:59,042 --> 01:45:01,305
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like actually a role in production.

1400
01:45:02,066 --> 01:45:05,010
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're kind of up in the ante on prize this year a little bit.

1401
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:06,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Jamie's trying out.

1402
01:45:06,973 --> 01:45:07,433
[SPEAKER_04]: For real?

1403
01:45:07,453 --> 01:45:08,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1404
01:45:08,234 --> 01:45:09,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, you should.

1405
01:45:09,516 --> 01:45:10,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.

1406
01:45:10,898 --> 01:45:11,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Sign up now.

1407
01:45:11,498 --> 01:45:11,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Why not?

1408
01:45:12,796 --> 01:45:15,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Look into it and see if the prize is something you'd actually want.

1409
01:45:15,579 --> 01:45:21,766
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, because if they can get me in any level of art production, that says my career right there.

1410
01:45:22,466 --> 01:45:27,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the prize is like actual on the production team this time.

1411
01:45:27,532 --> 01:45:28,814
[SPEAKER_12]: And it better not be peon.

1412
01:45:29,995 --> 01:45:31,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I actually have some skills to offer.

1413
01:45:32,062 --> 01:45:33,903
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1414
01:46:01,092 --> 01:46:02,753
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1415
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:28,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... It's kind of crazy, but I love it.

1416
01:46:28,681 --> 01:46:29,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you get on.

1417
01:46:29,702 --> 01:46:31,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually watched The Tester.

1418
01:46:32,583 --> 01:46:35,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Might I go so far as to say I enjoyed the last season of The Tester.

1419
01:46:35,424 --> 01:46:43,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they could do a little more with it, but... You might also want to watch the show to see... Oh, they give you an option for them not to share your shit.

1420
01:46:43,967 --> 01:46:44,407
[SPEAKER_12]: That's good.

1421
01:46:44,827 --> 01:46:46,868
[SPEAKER_04]: You have an idea what to expect just saying?

1422
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:53,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, I can't wait.

1423
01:46:54,034 --> 01:46:55,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope DarkSakura gets on the show.

1424
01:46:55,735 --> 01:46:58,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, that means she won't be on OLR for a few weeks while they're taping the show.

1425
01:47:00,199 --> 01:47:01,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Party at Jamie's house.

1426
01:47:02,001 --> 01:47:04,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, but I'll be famous and you won't.

1427
01:47:06,705 --> 01:47:09,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you'll get booted off first.

1428
01:47:09,367 --> 01:47:10,148
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I won't.

1429
01:47:12,129 --> 01:47:13,250
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't like my password.

1430
01:47:14,491 --> 01:47:15,452
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on.

1431
01:47:15,853 --> 01:47:17,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any more emails or is it the last one?

1432
01:47:17,774 --> 01:47:18,495
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1433
01:47:20,615 --> 01:47:21,516
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1434
01:47:45,672 --> 01:47:50,715
[SPEAKER_12]: As Loki predicted, GameStop has decided not to honor the price guarantee thing, which does not surprise me at all.

1435
01:47:50,815 --> 01:47:55,238
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, I'm not even sure I'll be able to get the 80 back from where I purchased it.

1436
01:47:55,919 --> 01:48:03,784
[SPEAKER_12]: I bought it at Best Buy, and they didn't know about the price drop or didn't say anything about not honoring their policy when I bought it, but I have this feeling that it won't work.

1437
01:48:03,884 --> 01:48:08,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Either way, in my mind, it's totally worth it just for the GBA titles alone.

1438
01:48:08,587 --> 01:48:10,408
[SPEAKER_12]: I really miss the Game Boy as a platform.

1439
01:48:10,928 --> 01:48:15,591
[SPEAKER_12]: I never really got into the DS like I did with the Game Boy and ended up selling the one I had three years ago.

1440
01:48:16,492 --> 01:48:19,154
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've been out of the DS world for three years.

1441
01:48:19,634 --> 01:48:20,474
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where you come in.

1442
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:28,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to keep my DS for more than just retro GBA titles I bought it for, so I would like to hear some of your favorite DS games that might suit my interests.

1443
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:33,563
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you recommend as games that appeal to everyone and what specific titles would interest someone like me?

1444
01:48:34,143 --> 01:48:35,824
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not a fan of RPGs anymore.

1445
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:36,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hang up.

1446
01:48:36,365 --> 01:48:36,705
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm kidding.

1447
01:48:37,245 --> 01:48:38,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Since I don't have the time to play them.

1448
01:48:39,206 --> 01:48:41,348
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm more into shooters, arcade games, and platformers.

1449
01:48:41,388 --> 01:48:44,249
[SPEAKER_12]: I plan on getting Geometry Wars Galaxies, a Castlevania title.

1450
01:48:44,289 --> 01:48:44,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Which one is best?

1451
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:46,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, what was that one?

1452
01:48:46,511 --> 01:48:47,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Order of Ecclesia was really good.

1453
01:48:49,032 --> 01:48:52,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, Retro Game Challenge, WarioWare Touch, Trauma Center 2.

1454
01:48:53,175 --> 01:48:56,938
[SPEAKER_12]: I picked up Ocarina of Time, obviously, and Plants vs. Zombies download version so far.

1455
01:48:57,298 --> 01:49:00,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Mario Kart DS is my favorite DS game from when I owned one before.

1456
01:49:01,482 --> 01:49:04,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I like, I got Puyo Pop, I mean Puyo Puyo.

1457
01:49:04,984 --> 01:49:08,347
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got Osutatakai Oendan, um, or you could get Elite Beat Agents.

1458
01:49:08,547 --> 01:49:10,088
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually really prefer the Japanese one.

1459
01:49:11,029 --> 01:49:13,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, what else is in my thing?

1460
01:49:13,551 --> 01:49:17,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, um, what was that Professor Hatsworth game?

1461
01:49:17,313 --> 01:49:18,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Layton?

1462
01:49:18,374 --> 01:49:19,514
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it was Hatsworth.

1463
01:49:21,355 --> 01:49:25,357
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a combination puzzle game and investigation game.

1464
01:49:25,757 --> 01:49:26,637
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really interesting.

1465
01:49:26,757 --> 01:49:28,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I kind of know what you're talking about, yeah.

1466
01:49:28,618 --> 01:49:29,458
[SPEAKER_12]: That game was pretty fun.

1467
01:49:29,478 --> 01:49:30,579
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1468
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:31,179
[SPEAKER_12]: What else, Rob?

1469
01:49:32,179 --> 01:49:33,380
[SPEAKER_04]: He named a lot of them.

1470
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, gosh, you got a whole full plate there.

1471
01:49:36,161 --> 01:49:38,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Retro Game Challenge was one of the ones that came to my mind, too.

1472
01:49:40,943 --> 01:49:43,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Really good games on DS.

1473
01:49:44,024 --> 01:49:46,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I need more time to think.

1474
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:49,940
[SPEAKER_12]: I should just go grab my DS case and see what's in it.

1475
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:50,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

1476
01:49:50,781 --> 01:49:53,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I can't see my DS collection right in front of me.

1477
01:49:53,923 --> 01:49:56,825
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are really into the Pokemon games.

1478
01:49:56,845 --> 01:49:57,866
[SPEAKER_12]: I play a lot of Cooking Mama.

1479
01:49:59,507 --> 01:50:02,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Since he's talking about Trauma Center, Cooking Mama's like that with food.

1480
01:50:03,971 --> 01:50:04,831
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's really fun.

1481
01:50:04,972 --> 01:50:06,753
[SPEAKER_12]: And don't worry, Mama will fix it.

1482
01:50:07,614 --> 01:50:10,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked the Kirby game where you draw the lines.

1483
01:50:11,196 --> 01:50:11,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, um...

1484
01:50:13,131 --> 01:50:14,392
[SPEAKER_04]: and Kirby's... Epic Yarn.

1485
01:50:14,892 --> 01:50:16,152
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, that was the Wii game.

1486
01:50:17,593 --> 01:50:20,374
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a different Kirby game where you would draw all the lines and stuff.

1487
01:50:20,414 --> 01:50:21,175
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember.

1488
01:50:21,195 --> 01:50:22,975
[SPEAKER_12]: You're making me think.

1489
01:50:23,876 --> 01:50:24,876
[SPEAKER_12]: What am I, a talk show host?

1490
01:50:26,437 --> 01:50:29,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the old school, like even the Mario 64 port is actually really good too.

1491
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:32,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Elite Beat Agents says Dungeon Buster and Chat.

1492
01:50:32,539 --> 01:50:33,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I said that.

1493
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:37,462
[SPEAKER_12]: So I said Oendan, but I said you can get it as Elite Beat Agents, although I prefer Oendan.

1494
01:50:37,482 --> 01:50:38,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1495
01:50:41,224 --> 01:50:42,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, there's Ragnarok.

1496
01:50:43,085 --> 01:50:45,247
[SPEAKER_12]: That's RPG though.

1497
01:50:46,167 --> 01:50:46,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked it though.

1498
01:50:46,868 --> 01:50:48,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakman Civilization Revolution.

1499
01:50:48,589 --> 01:50:49,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I really liked that game.

1500
01:50:49,950 --> 01:50:52,372
[SPEAKER_04]: But I liked it on the consoles.

1501
01:50:52,452 --> 01:50:54,394
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how well I should get my DS custom look.

1502
01:50:55,694 --> 01:50:57,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Then again, I've got like a box of games.

1503
01:50:57,696 --> 01:51:00,098
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll lend you one.

1504
01:51:00,538 --> 01:51:02,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'll sell you some of them.

1505
01:51:04,031 --> 01:51:32,155
[SPEAKER_12]: I might not be listening live because of work early in the morning I'm on the east coast so if the chat has any good recommendations too I would love to hear those in the podcast which we just did oh he said he's not into RPGs but the Final Fantasy 4 remake is so fucking good like you might want to think about going back to RPGs for that keep up the great work with the podcast it's still my favorite out there by a long shot thanks guys SonicM88 oh and by the way I am playing Final Fantasy 3 and it's pretty good on the game see there you go

[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love what Zether says here.

1509
01:51:39,716 --> 01:51:40,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Meteos is awesome.

1510
01:51:41,758 --> 01:51:42,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Meteos was an amazing DS game.

1511
01:51:42,979 --> 01:51:43,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Electroplankton was kind of fun.

1512
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,921
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a great DS game.

1513
01:51:47,442 --> 01:51:48,343
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, is that it for emails?

1514
01:51:48,863 --> 01:51:49,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

01:51:49,404 --> 01:51:50,805
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the way, I've got a profile now.

1516
01:51:51,125 --> 01:51:53,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1517
01:51:53,627 --> 01:51:55,729
[SPEAKER_12]: I ain't got a picture, but I'll link it in the chat room.

1518
01:51:55,769 --> 01:51:56,810
[SPEAKER_04]: You should put a picture.

1519
01:51:56,850 --> 01:51:59,492
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to start filling it out with why you need to be on the tester.

1520
01:52:00,272 --> 01:52:01,293
[SPEAKER_13]: I will, but I'm linking it already.

1521
01:52:01,333 --> 01:52:02,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a job.

1522
01:52:04,551 --> 01:52:12,517
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to talk about how much you love Sony and how you've been a gaming girl all your life I bet you'll get on I bet you will

1523
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:15,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1524
01:52:16,141 --> 01:52:16,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1525
01:52:16,801 --> 01:52:18,242
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some more news stories for you guys.

1526
01:52:18,322 --> 01:52:19,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we got the FUs of the week.

1527
01:52:19,683 --> 01:52:20,283
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta do those.

1528
01:52:20,684 --> 01:52:29,129
[SPEAKER_05]: As much fun as I would like to join the tester, I would hate to have to move to LA to be a game tester.

1529
01:52:30,050 --> 01:52:33,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you do know you have to move to Santa Monica to be a game, to do the production, right?

1530
01:52:34,612 --> 01:52:35,053
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't care.

1531
01:52:35,073 --> 01:52:35,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

1532
01:52:37,074 --> 01:52:38,055
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll be closer to Disneyland.

1533
01:52:38,755 --> 01:52:39,936
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be closer to Disneyland.

1534
01:52:40,757 --> 01:52:46,341
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, the problem is though, it's a judging panel that decides whether... Or is it challenges?

1535
01:52:46,461 --> 01:52:46,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1536
01:52:46,761 --> 01:52:47,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never watched the show.

1537
01:52:48,823 --> 01:52:51,725
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird challenges that sometimes have nothing to do with games.

1538
01:52:51,745 --> 01:52:58,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like we challenge you to like, you know... It's not like... See, because when I first heard about the tester, I was thinking it's that...

1539
01:52:59,751 --> 01:53:08,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I own more than 40 different video game systems and have decades of experience I'm also a graphic designer with a focus on video games and an experience in 3D design and Maya I could use a job!

1540
01:53:28,547 --> 01:53:29,068
[SPEAKER_12]: How's that sound?

1541
01:53:29,468 --> 01:53:50,810
[SPEAKER_12]: You should give a shout out to the podcast too Just for when you uh Just for, you know When I am on I'll do it in my video Oh my god, I gotta do a video I better be super cute Better get your hair did I need to get my hair did, my nails did

1542
01:53:51,678 --> 01:53:53,320
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still naming DS games in the chat.

1543
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:54,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Zether says Contra 4.

1544
01:53:54,801 --> 01:53:56,883
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty good.

1545
01:53:57,584 --> 01:54:02,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakman in chat says, Loki couldn't do the tester because Loki doesn't take orders.

1546
01:54:02,128 --> 01:54:03,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki gives orders.

1547
01:54:03,609 --> 01:54:04,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Mwahaha.

1548
01:54:05,311 --> 01:54:06,332
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1549
01:54:07,773 --> 01:54:08,714
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you looking at there?

1550
01:54:08,734 --> 01:54:10,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you doing a Tiny Tower cheat?

1551
01:54:10,696 --> 01:54:11,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what's happening?

1552
01:54:12,998 --> 01:54:16,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you cheat and you have 6 million gold in Tiny Tower, you damn cheater?

1553
01:54:16,881 --> 01:54:17,382
[SPEAKER_04]: What the crap?

1554
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:18,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a cheater.

1555
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,241
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a damn dirty cheater.

1556
01:54:20,261 --> 01:54:20,621
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you do it?

1557
01:54:20,741 --> 01:54:21,621
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not cheating.

1558
01:54:21,701 --> 01:54:22,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to know.

1559
01:54:22,121 --> 01:54:23,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a jailbroken device.

1560
01:54:23,301 --> 01:54:24,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do whatever the fuck I want.

1561
01:54:26,402 --> 01:54:27,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's completely legal.

1562
01:54:27,902 --> 01:54:32,884
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a lying, cheating sack of shit.

1563
01:54:33,004 --> 01:54:36,224
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you're not going to be a fucking game tester.

1564
01:54:37,405 --> 01:54:38,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can't play by the rules.

1565
01:54:38,945 --> 01:54:39,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullshit.

1566
01:54:39,545 --> 01:54:40,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be an awesome tester.

1567
01:54:40,865 --> 01:54:41,326
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1568
01:54:41,406 --> 01:54:42,926
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, there was a thing that I saw.

1569
01:54:43,286 --> 01:54:44,787
[SPEAKER_12]: My picture, and it's cute.

1570
01:54:44,867 --> 01:54:45,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there you go.

1571
01:54:45,768 --> 01:54:47,249
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a... I mean, shit.

1572
01:54:47,429 --> 01:54:52,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played so much Grand Theft Auto, I could easily be a tester for their goddamn multiplayer stuff.

1573
01:54:52,992 --> 01:54:57,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the ins and outs of all of their Grand Theft Auto games, including the PSP.

1574
01:54:57,555 --> 01:54:59,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I know shit that they probably don't even know.

1575
01:55:00,417 --> 01:55:05,580
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, again, I don't want to compete on a show where I have to compare images to see what's different.

1576
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,701
[SPEAKER_05]: If I wanted to do that, I'd buy a DS. ...

1577
01:55:11,986 --> 01:55:17,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Breakman says when you apply for the job, DarkSakura, just tell them you know the Bobby Blackwolf.

1578
01:55:17,094 --> 01:55:18,075
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be hired on right away.

1579
01:55:18,315 --> 01:55:18,736
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1580
01:55:18,816 --> 01:55:21,300
[SPEAKER_04]: After all, he is a trending topic in Sacramento this evening.

1581
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:21,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1582
01:55:24,665 --> 01:55:26,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

1583
01:55:42,983 --> 01:55:47,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, my FU of the week goes to me not having a copy of Black Matrix.

1584
01:55:48,978 --> 01:55:50,061
[SPEAKER_12]: I found it on eBay.

1585
01:55:50,101 --> 01:55:51,184
[SPEAKER_12]: No one will buy it for me.

1586
01:55:51,244 --> 01:55:51,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Boo hoo.

1587
01:55:53,531 --> 01:56:08,343
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to Loki for cheating on Tiny Tower and I hope his tower, because it's so cheaply made, I hope that the material that his Tiny Tower was made out of just collapses on itself and the whole building just implodes.

1588
01:56:09,043 --> 01:56:10,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Have the blood of his bitizens on his hands.

1589
01:56:11,085 --> 01:56:14,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, and you'll have the blood of all those bitizens on your hands.

1590
01:56:15,408 --> 01:56:19,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I give an FU to tacos for being so delicious and making me fat.

1591
01:56:20,172 --> 01:56:20,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1592
01:56:22,393 --> 01:56:46,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my F you would go to the tester because if I were to win the tester I'd end up working at Sony and I'd look at the sheet of things that they want me to test I'm sorry, I'm supposed to test to see if this game doesn't suck I don't know, I got nothing I'm not really mad at anything

1593
01:56:48,371 --> 01:56:51,393
[SPEAKER_05]: It was surprisingly easy to do with the jailbroken device.

1594
01:56:53,314 --> 01:56:54,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I might add.

1595
01:56:55,335 --> 01:56:57,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Download a file, copy it over, done.

1596
01:56:57,817 --> 01:56:59,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And it didn't even erase my progress.

1597
01:56:59,318 --> 01:57:00,799
[SPEAKER_05]: It just added six million money.

1598
01:57:01,179 --> 01:57:04,801
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I see that DarkSakura has a profile.

1599
01:57:04,861 --> 01:57:05,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how do I vote for you?

1600
01:57:06,062 --> 01:57:08,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's a big clock in the corner.

1601
01:57:08,243 --> 01:57:10,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Voting begins in 16 days.

1602
01:57:10,345 --> 01:57:12,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I can't actually vote for you yet, I guess.

1603
01:57:14,420 --> 01:57:14,820
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1604
01:57:40,462 --> 01:58:00,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I've added a second picture of what my hair looks like curly You know, it just occurred to me Derek H, I think on Dead Pixel Live last year had the casting dude for the tester on his show You need to talk to Derek and get dude's email address and just be like, yo, cast me That's what you need to do You need to just bypass this whole system right here

1605
01:58:03,704 --> 01:58:05,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Go directly to show.

1606
01:58:05,565 --> 01:58:06,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not pass go.

1607
01:58:07,366 --> 01:58:08,847
[SPEAKER_05]: We should all be on the test.

1608
01:58:08,987 --> 01:58:10,067
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're not all going on.

1609
01:58:10,287 --> 01:58:11,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going on that goddamn show.

1610
01:58:11,948 --> 01:58:13,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, it'd be hilarious.

1611
01:58:13,369 --> 01:58:20,072
[SPEAKER_04]: If I go on the show, it is to be a judge because I would enjoy nothing more than the judge, the two of you sitting up there getting ready for elimination.

1612
01:58:20,132 --> 01:58:22,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that guy doesn't know shit about testing games.

1613
01:58:23,594 --> 01:58:26,295
[SPEAKER_05]: He wasn't even a trending topic in Sacramento.

1614
01:58:27,793 --> 01:58:30,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Loki, you're a goddamn cheater at all your video games.

1615
01:58:30,394 --> 01:58:31,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain why you should be on the tester.

1616
01:58:32,095 --> 01:58:36,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know where to find the information that you're looking for.

1617
01:58:36,478 --> 01:58:42,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I know to find all the exploits and backdoors for your games and how to get around this stuff.

1618
01:58:42,701 --> 01:58:45,242
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't fix this shit, other people are going to do it.

1619
01:58:45,602 --> 01:58:47,723
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your Kinect is still in a box.

1620
01:58:47,803 --> 01:58:49,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Why should you be the tester?

1621
01:58:50,045 --> 01:58:51,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my Kinect's in the box.

1622
01:58:51,706 --> 01:58:53,807
[SPEAKER_05]: My move is fucking on the TV.

1623
01:58:54,087 --> 01:58:56,188
[SPEAKER_05]: That is why I need to be a fucking tester.

1624
01:58:58,217 --> 01:59:04,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we have a goddamn Gran Turismo setup built in our house where we can play in a fucking race car.

1625
01:59:04,218 --> 01:59:05,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your name DarkSakura?

1626
01:59:05,419 --> 01:59:05,939
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

1627
01:59:05,959 --> 01:59:07,359
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't sound like DarkSakura.

1628
01:59:08,739 --> 01:59:12,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, because we have a $400 rig setup to play Gran Turismo 5.

1629
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:20,982
[SPEAKER_12]: And that we've built seats to play the setup out of the seats from a Honda Prelude.

1630
01:59:21,342 --> 01:59:21,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Two of them.

1631
01:59:22,862 --> 01:59:25,543
[SPEAKER_12]: I have every Sony system ever made.

1632
01:59:25,563 --> 01:59:26,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, here...

1633
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:33,637
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fine radio and all, but there's a part of me that is legit worried you're actually going to get on this show.

1634
01:59:34,218 --> 01:59:36,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I have legitimate concerns.

1635
01:59:36,141 --> 01:59:38,203
[SPEAKER_12]: If I get a job out of this, fuck yeah.

1636
01:59:38,564 --> 01:59:40,887
[SPEAKER_04]: But this could also end up very bad.

1637
01:59:40,967 --> 01:59:42,529
[SPEAKER_04]: You could end up being the bitch.

1638
01:59:43,049 --> 01:59:45,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen you go without eating for some time.

1639
01:59:47,293 --> 01:59:57,757
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not going to be pretty if you have to do something Yes, Rob knows what low blood sugar Jamie is like And you might have to do something that you don't like on this program And I am very worried I should sign up too, it would be hilarious Like what?

1640
01:59:57,837 --> 02:00:00,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Play Imagine Babies?

1641
02:00:00,358 --> 02:00:15,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, one last season they had some fucking challenge where they were out there doing army stuff Okay, I know, I know what will piss you off Working together as a team with people who are idiots That is going to piss you off beyond belief See, you're already fretting

1642
02:00:15,763 --> 02:00:20,326
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I will tell you this, because I worked with idiots at my job and I hid it very well.

1643
02:00:22,347 --> 02:00:24,149
[SPEAKER_12]: I know how to be a team fucking player.

1644
02:00:26,390 --> 02:00:26,891
[SPEAKER_12]: I am good.

1645
02:00:27,011 --> 02:00:27,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1646
02:00:27,151 --> 02:00:28,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you teach Loki a thing or two?

1647
02:00:29,852 --> 02:00:30,033
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1648
02:00:30,373 --> 02:00:31,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I am my own team.

1649
02:00:32,314 --> 02:00:34,476
[SPEAKER_12]: No, because his team is the voices in his head.

1650
02:00:35,917 --> 02:00:38,198
[SPEAKER_12]: I can take a picture of the vault.

1651
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:40,730
[SPEAKER_12]: and show it to them.

1652
02:00:41,531 --> 02:00:44,412
[SPEAKER_12]: This is why you need to have me because I've played all this shit.

1653
02:00:44,492 --> 02:00:50,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Legitimate concern that you actually may make a case for yourself to be on this show and you will actually be on this program.

1654
02:00:50,674 --> 02:00:51,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at this face.

1655
02:00:52,235 --> 02:00:53,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at this adorable face.

1656
02:00:53,355 --> 02:00:54,215
[SPEAKER_12]: I try not to.

1657
02:00:54,956 --> 02:00:55,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up.

1658
02:00:55,636 --> 02:00:56,496
[SPEAKER_12]: I gave you ice cream.

1659
02:00:56,516 --> 02:00:56,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at me.

1660
02:00:58,297 --> 02:00:58,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking.

1661
02:00:59,597 --> 02:01:00,278
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm serious.

1662
02:01:01,338 --> 02:01:02,418
[SPEAKER_12]: I am for real serious.

1663
02:01:02,599 --> 02:01:03,579
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to be on the tester.

1664
02:01:04,807 --> 02:01:08,428
[SPEAKER_05]: You do realize this is for a minimum wage job in Santa Monica, right?

1665
02:01:08,488 --> 02:01:09,328
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be.

1666
02:01:09,428 --> 02:01:12,389
[SPEAKER_04]: But know that Annie's up this season.

1667
02:01:12,449 --> 02:01:13,970
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a production job this year.

1668
02:01:14,190 --> 02:01:16,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Which means that I would be... A production job?

1669
02:01:16,171 --> 02:01:16,931
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's that mean?

1670
02:01:16,951 --> 02:01:17,911
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll put it this way.

1671
02:01:18,031 --> 02:01:30,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Production is like... For a graphic designer, production would be like color editing, color correction, adjusting textures, that type of thing.

1672
02:01:30,575 --> 02:01:31,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a bunch of spindles of discs.

1673
02:01:32,015 --> 02:01:32,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a bunch of cases.

1674
02:01:33,016 --> 02:01:35,176
[SPEAKER_05]: We need you to produce the finished product.

1675
02:01:35,436 --> 02:01:35,616
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1676
02:01:35,976 --> 02:01:36,716
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not how it works.

1677
02:01:37,417 --> 02:01:41,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyone that's in production is in the actual building part of the game.

1678
02:01:41,557 --> 02:01:43,438
[SPEAKER_12]: You may be crunching numbers or doing some data entry.

1679
02:01:44,438 --> 02:01:48,359
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be something that's the equivalent of the job that I was just fucking doing.

1680
02:01:49,239 --> 02:01:51,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Except I actually have skills to bring to the table.

1681
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:53,000
[SPEAKER_12]: They could put me to work in art production.

1682
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:54,460
[SPEAKER_12]: And guess what?

1683
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:57,701
[SPEAKER_12]: I would be good at it because that's what I'm trying to do with my life.

1684
02:01:58,865 --> 02:01:59,266
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1685
02:02:00,408 --> 02:02:03,433
[SPEAKER_05]: If I sign up for the tester, I'm going to do it in my costume.

1686
02:02:05,339 --> 02:02:07,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you people trying out for the tester?

1687
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:09,380
[SPEAKER_04]: You used to make fun of this show two years ago.

1688
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:10,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the whole point.

1689
02:02:10,121 --> 02:02:10,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you understand?

1690
02:02:10,921 --> 02:02:11,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I need a job.

1691
02:02:12,841 --> 02:02:13,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you understand?

1692
02:02:13,782 --> 02:02:14,502
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the whole point.

1693
02:02:14,522 --> 02:02:15,882
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the funniest part about it.

1694
02:02:16,463 --> 02:02:23,485
[SPEAKER_05]: What better way to get back at something that you hate than to be part of it and then be a complete asshole on it?

1695
02:02:23,985 --> 02:02:24,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be awesome.

1696
02:02:25,005 --> 02:02:26,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob, for real though.

1697
02:02:26,246 --> 02:02:27,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to win.

1698
02:02:27,506 --> 02:02:29,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to be on the show.

1699
02:02:30,583 --> 02:02:31,804
[SPEAKER_12]: And see, I want a job.

1700
02:02:32,805 --> 02:02:33,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Frisbee.

1701
02:02:33,765 --> 02:02:36,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be the very best that no one ever was.

1702
02:02:37,128 --> 02:02:37,928
[SPEAKER_12]: I want a job.

1703
02:02:38,268 --> 02:02:41,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, any of you people listening to the show, I'm talented.

1704
02:02:41,431 --> 02:02:41,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Hire me.

1705
02:02:42,852 --> 02:02:52,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Because honestly though, because I was thinking about it, I would, if the job equivalency is what I'm thinking of, I would be making about what I made at my old job.

1706
02:02:52,238 --> 02:02:54,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you be able to tighten up the graphics on level three?

1707
02:02:55,621 --> 02:02:55,981
[SPEAKER_12]: I could try.

1708
02:02:56,814 --> 02:02:57,735
[SPEAKER_04]: No, hold on, hold on.

1709
02:02:57,755 --> 02:02:59,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to just show DarkSakura this real quick here.

1710
02:03:00,296 --> 02:03:01,737
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I just want to show you this.

1711
02:03:01,777 --> 02:03:03,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at all those douchebags.

1712
02:03:03,338 --> 02:03:06,419
[SPEAKER_03]: You really are going to have to team play with them.

1713
02:03:06,459 --> 02:03:09,681
[SPEAKER_01]: You do know that, right?

1714
02:03:25,103 --> 02:03:32,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, see, as Rob, as the one of superior intellect, I would actually manipulate them into failure.

1715
02:03:33,051 --> 02:03:34,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick one of the contestants.

1716
02:03:34,533 --> 02:03:37,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations, 8-Bit Mickey.

1717
02:03:37,336 --> 02:03:41,040
[SPEAKER_03]: These 12 gamers will be living together in PlayStation Paradise.

1718
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:44,263
I am one with the video games.

1719
02:03:44,484 --> 02:03:46,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hurt him so bad.

1720
02:03:47,745 --> 02:03:51,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to murder these people.

1721
02:03:51,449 --> 02:03:53,411
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to do a dancing competition.

1722
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:55,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to do a dancing competition, DarkSakura?

1723
02:03:55,814 --> 02:03:57,977
[SPEAKER_12]: I got rhythm.

1724
02:03:58,037 --> 02:03:59,098
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll do all para para.

1725
02:03:59,358 --> 02:04:00,880
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't even miss a beat in saying that.

1726
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:01,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I got rhythm.

1727
02:04:03,062 --> 02:04:11,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, have you seen... Now, this is hilarious because Joystick decided that they made casting videos for each one of the people on their staff.

1728
02:04:11,504 --> 02:04:11,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1729
02:04:12,465 --> 02:04:12,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Well played.

1730
02:04:12,945 --> 02:04:14,285
[SPEAKER_05]: They have some really funny ones.

1731
02:04:14,365 --> 02:04:14,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Well played.

1732
02:04:15,366 --> 02:04:16,146
[SPEAKER_12]: No, seriously, Rob.

1733
02:04:16,246 --> 02:04:16,986
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll do Parapara.

1734
02:04:18,066 --> 02:04:18,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1735
02:04:18,807 --> 02:04:19,847
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fine.

1736
02:04:20,947 --> 02:04:21,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you get the job.

1737
02:04:22,088 --> 02:04:23,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I legit hope you get the job.

1738
02:04:23,668 --> 02:04:26,269
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll bring the video camera and show off my bemani.

1739
02:04:27,549 --> 02:04:30,571
[SPEAKER_12]: and all this other quality PlayStation shit I have.

1740
02:04:31,252 --> 02:04:40,898
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, quality PlayStation products that I've spent my good hard-earned money on and my first generation PlayStation 3 so I can say, look, Linux!

1741
02:04:41,618 --> 02:04:44,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, look at PlayStation 1 games.

1742
02:04:45,441 --> 02:04:49,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Zether is linking me to a YouTube saying this was a tester contestant.

1743
02:04:49,383 --> 02:04:50,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to see this here.

1744
02:04:50,564 --> 02:04:50,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1745
02:04:51,164 --> 02:04:55,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch out, they're coming through the window Watch out, they're coming through the window

1746
02:05:00,442 --> 02:05:01,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that Rebecca Black?

1747
02:05:03,903 --> 02:05:05,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, yes, it's Rebecca Black, DarkSakura.

1748
02:05:07,665 --> 02:05:08,185
[SPEAKER_04]: All grown up.

1749
02:05:09,806 --> 02:05:12,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say, if you go on the show, that's going to be you.

1750
02:05:12,547 --> 02:05:14,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get a hey there coming through the window?

1751
02:05:14,707 --> 02:05:15,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, DarkSakura.

1752
02:05:15,928 --> 02:05:16,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Bite my ass.

1753
02:05:18,869 --> 02:05:19,789
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not a team player.

1754
02:05:19,849 --> 02:05:21,370
[SPEAKER_04]: You lied when you said you were a team player.

1755
02:05:23,897 --> 02:05:26,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, let's move on with some actual gaming news.

1756
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:37,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Maroon 5 has decided to join in the lawsuits against Activision over Guitar Hero.

1757
02:05:37,604 --> 02:05:38,625
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, it's Band Hero.

1758
02:05:39,145 --> 02:05:45,709
[SPEAKER_05]: He is suing because Activision improbably uses likeness in Band Hero and...

1759
02:05:46,297 --> 02:05:47,858
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1760
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:18,163
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great because he said he did the motion capture to have his avatar used in the Band Hero song, She Will Be Loved, but didn't give Activision permission to use his likeness with other songs, which it totally did.

1761
02:06:18,743 --> 02:06:20,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Deja vu from like a year ago.

1762
02:06:20,604 --> 02:06:25,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Levine alleges Activision asked other artists for expanded use of their avatars and paid them more for the process.

1763
02:06:28,946 --> 02:06:31,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, it's last year all over again.

1764
02:06:31,887 --> 02:06:32,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1765
02:06:32,207 --> 02:06:33,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1766
02:06:35,103 --> 02:06:37,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, you know, the same thing happened with, you know, No Doubt.

1767
02:06:37,684 --> 02:06:40,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think they just want a piece of the money as well?

1768
02:06:40,665 --> 02:06:42,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's really what it's got to do with, huh?

1769
02:06:43,305 --> 02:06:44,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1770
02:06:44,386 --> 02:06:45,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even care.

1771
02:06:45,506 --> 02:06:47,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because boo fucking hoo.

1772
02:06:47,486 --> 02:06:48,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Get over it.

1773
02:06:48,447 --> 02:06:49,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

1774
02:06:49,587 --> 02:06:49,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

1775
02:06:50,007 --> 02:06:53,188
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in a game singing other people's songs in their voice.

1776
02:06:55,946 --> 02:06:56,987
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an avatar.

1777
02:06:57,127 --> 02:06:57,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

1778
02:06:58,109 --> 02:07:05,318
[SPEAKER_05]: No one made you like... No one drugged you up and made you sing those songs on stage for like a live concert or something like that.

1779
02:07:05,498 --> 02:07:06,540
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a digital...

1780
02:07:07,406 --> 02:07:10,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Character, not really you.

1781
02:07:11,627 --> 02:07:14,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they don't steal your soul and put it into the game.

1782
02:07:14,568 --> 02:07:17,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, unless you may think that's how it works.

1783
02:07:17,869 --> 02:07:19,269
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really you.

1784
02:07:19,349 --> 02:07:21,230
[SPEAKER_04]: My art is my soul.

1785
02:07:21,450 --> 02:07:25,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I sing a Miley Cyrus song in these games, that's raping my art.

1786
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:55,634
[SPEAKER_05]: well here's the problem I didn't want to hear anything about Miley Cyrus and rape you put your songs into Band Hero Band Hero which is the poppy version of Guitar Hero you should have really put your stuff in the Guitar Hero not Band Hero or Rock Band alright I don't know what to make of this next story let's see what you guys think of it let's see

1787
02:07:57,423 --> 02:08:10,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Pete Hines from Bethesda Softworks figured that February 18th would be the perfect day to conceive a child, as the baby would be due on November 11th, which would be the ship date for the Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.

1788
02:08:12,173 --> 02:08:15,996
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another couple, though, that has conceived a little bit earlier than that.

1789
02:08:16,996 --> 02:08:17,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1790
02:08:17,497 --> 02:08:23,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Atari Lin, I guess, is the child, decided to come out of...

1791
02:08:25,382 --> 02:08:35,047
[SPEAKER_04]: The mom's womb as mom and dad sat down for the half-hour demo of the Bethesda Skyrim demo at QuakeCon.

1792
02:08:36,088 --> 02:08:43,311
[SPEAKER_04]: The father talked to Game Informer that I guess the sight of the Frost Dragon on the screen sent mom into labor.

1793
02:08:45,652 --> 02:08:51,735
[SPEAKER_04]: The couple hung around rather than dashing for the hospital because they thought it might be false labor.

1794
02:08:52,356 --> 02:08:54,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And she loves Skyrim.

1795
02:08:57,461 --> 02:08:59,482
[SPEAKER_04]: They named the baby apparently Atari Lynn.

1796
02:09:03,603 --> 02:09:04,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Dorks.

1797
02:09:04,764 --> 02:09:06,945
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they are one letter away from Atari Lynx.

1798
02:09:07,605 --> 02:09:09,326
[SPEAKER_04]: They made a baby.

1799
02:09:11,186 --> 02:09:13,267
[SPEAKER_04]: And they went into labor.

1800
02:09:13,727 --> 02:09:15,208
[SPEAKER_04]: But they didn't go to hospital right away.

1801
02:09:15,228 --> 02:09:17,349
[SPEAKER_12]: So the baby drowned at the thing?

1802
02:09:17,509 --> 02:09:19,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they didn't want to miss the demo, DarkSakura.

1803
02:09:19,950 --> 02:09:23,031
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see Skyrim.

1804
02:09:23,513 --> 02:09:23,894
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

1805
02:09:37,179 --> 02:09:42,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Kotaku, who first broke this story, so to speak, was actually contacted by the mother.

1806
02:09:43,524 --> 02:09:49,369
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that she's actually still in labor and reading the comments, but I guess they are still naming the baby Atari.

1807
02:09:50,049 --> 02:09:53,772
[SPEAKER_04]: The name Atari comes from the name Ataru, which means to hit a target.

1808
02:09:54,593 --> 02:09:58,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, yeah, that's what they named the baby after, is to hit a target.

1809
02:09:59,699 --> 02:10:00,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Ataru hit a target.

1810
02:10:01,201 --> 02:10:02,722
[SPEAKER_05]: This baby's gonna be a bullet.

1811
02:10:02,903 --> 02:10:03,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna hit a target.

1812
02:10:04,084 --> 02:10:09,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Not naming it after a game system that these geeks obviously named their kid after.

1813
02:10:09,690 --> 02:10:15,236
[SPEAKER_04]: They also do say, we assume by the time she's in high school, most of the children her age are not gonna know what an Atari is.

1814
02:10:17,098 --> 02:10:17,999
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not true.

1815
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:19,501
[SPEAKER_04]: They should know.

1816
02:10:21,563 --> 02:10:21,703
[SPEAKER_04]: That...

1817
02:10:23,730 --> 02:10:27,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, you know, it's just like, can you imagine when the kid wants to know someday?

1818
02:10:27,592 --> 02:10:29,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, tell me the story.

1819
02:10:29,252 --> 02:10:30,773
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so retarded.

1820
02:10:31,553 --> 02:10:32,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

1821
02:10:32,673 --> 02:10:34,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're not going to know what an Atari is.

1822
02:10:34,694 --> 02:10:34,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1823
02:10:35,194 --> 02:10:37,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Because children don't learn history?

1824
02:10:38,576 --> 02:10:39,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

1825
02:10:39,696 --> 02:10:41,877
[SPEAKER_05]: What is, you know, the 13 colonies?

1826
02:10:42,097 --> 02:10:44,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know because I wasn't alive then.

1827
02:10:45,018 --> 02:10:48,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, name five movie stars from the 1940s.

1828
02:10:48,559 --> 02:10:48,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Go.

1829
02:10:52,776 --> 02:10:53,377
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

1830
02:10:53,597 --> 02:10:53,857
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

1831
02:10:53,897 --> 02:10:56,338
[SPEAKER_04]: You couldn't do it, so maybe they can't do it.

1832
02:10:56,418 --> 02:10:56,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1833
02:10:57,659 --> 02:10:59,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's the thought behind it.

1834
02:11:00,161 --> 02:11:03,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Fay Wray?

1835
02:11:04,183 --> 02:11:06,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's... She's in the 30s.

1836
02:11:06,204 --> 02:11:06,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit!

1837
02:11:06,584 --> 02:11:07,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Ernest Borgnine?

1838
02:11:07,845 --> 02:11:08,466
[SPEAKER_04]: He's old enough.

1839
02:11:12,034 --> 02:11:12,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1840
02:11:28,963 --> 02:11:34,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So, here's the interesting comment, though, from Skyrim director Todd Howard.

1841
02:11:34,327 --> 02:11:36,708
[SPEAKER_04]: It's speaking to PSM3, one of the magazines there.

1842
02:11:37,589 --> 02:11:42,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think industry-wide we would benefit from more games out at $19 or $29.

1843
02:11:42,532 --> 02:11:46,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I would try more games because I'm not going to try a game for $60.

1844
02:11:47,435 --> 02:11:48,456
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tough decision.

1845
02:11:48,976 --> 02:11:53,459
[SPEAKER_04]: But then they went on to say that, yes, the $60 price point is still what Skyrim is going to be at.

1846
02:11:53,499 --> 02:11:58,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there should be more games at $19 and $29, but Skyrim is still $60, just so you know.

1847
02:11:59,235 --> 02:12:03,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say it, okay, all joking aside, the irony aside, he kind of does have a point, though.

1848
02:12:03,917 --> 02:12:09,299
[SPEAKER_04]: If games overall were kind of cheaper, it wouldn't feel like such a loss to try a game at $19 or $20.

1849
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:11,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the fact of the matter is most games aren't worth $60.

1850
02:12:13,181 --> 02:12:17,543
[SPEAKER_04]: 300 hours out of a game, I mean, that's unheard of in most cases.

1851
02:12:17,743 --> 02:12:21,365
[SPEAKER_05]: If only there were a way to try games before you bought them.

1852
02:12:22,585 --> 02:12:23,246
[SPEAKER_05]: We could call it...

1853
02:12:24,586 --> 02:12:29,009
[SPEAKER_05]: or Rentine or Demos.

1854
02:12:31,190 --> 02:12:44,779
[SPEAKER_05]: If only such things existed in modern society, but us being so barbaric have not had the foresight to create such wonderful implementations of trials.

1855
02:12:45,019 --> 02:12:45,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1856
02:12:46,946 --> 02:12:48,289
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, you're right.

1857
02:12:48,329 --> 02:12:52,498
[SPEAKER_05]: We should tell the studios that spend millions of dollars in production to, hey, you know what?

1858
02:12:52,538 --> 02:12:56,026
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to put your game out for two bucks because no one's really going to buy it unless it's two bucks.

1859
02:12:59,676 --> 02:13:02,797
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I know you're working on your application, but do you have time for another story for us?

1860
02:13:28,832 --> 02:13:57,809
[SPEAKER_12]: I sure do well you know they just had the EVO tournament well they're going to have to relearn all their characters all over again at least for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition a patch is coming out that will rebalance the game so right now it's really imbalanced so they're hoping to fix it it's going to be version 2012 and they did announce that at EVO Yoshinori Ono actually said that they've been location testing the version in Japan

1861
02:14:00,103 --> 02:14:00,383
[SPEAKER_12]: So there.

1862
02:14:01,303 --> 02:14:02,104
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't have to buy it again.

1863
02:14:02,204 --> 02:14:03,764
[SPEAKER_12]: You just have to download the patch.

1864
02:14:05,025 --> 02:14:11,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's good that it's just a patch this time and yet not another way to milk more money out of the same damn game as they've been doing for the past three years.

1865
02:14:12,027 --> 02:14:12,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, right?

1866
02:14:14,729 --> 02:14:15,069
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1867
02:14:15,369 --> 02:14:15,729
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1868
02:14:16,289 --> 02:14:27,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple more stories for you guys and we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and we'll get to your Twitter topics as well at twitter.com slash OLR.

1869
02:14:27,073 --> 02:14:28,834
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, a couple last stories for you.

1870
02:14:29,014 --> 02:14:29,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1871
02:14:32,148 --> 02:14:33,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1872
02:14:49,498 --> 02:14:50,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully, that wasn't the case, actually.

1873
02:14:51,859 --> 02:14:58,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Namco Bandai came out and said, actually, there is a way to reset your game saves on our game.

1874
02:14:59,322 --> 02:15:07,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you do is basically upon startup, players can input the command abxylr and it will wipe the save data from the cartridge.

1875
02:15:08,186 --> 02:15:11,667
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, how they should have done it on all the games.

1876
02:15:12,627 --> 02:15:14,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident Evil Capcom.

1877
02:15:15,889 --> 02:15:16,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh...

1878
02:15:18,297 --> 02:15:22,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a secret code the whole time just hiding out there behind the couch.

1879
02:15:22,079 --> 02:15:22,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knew?

1880
02:15:22,419 --> 02:15:24,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, unfortunately that's not the case with Capcoms.

1881
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:28,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that might be one of those things that they kind of announced it now just to kind of like cover their ass?

1882
02:15:28,962 --> 02:15:30,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's exactly what they did.

1883
02:15:31,803 --> 02:15:32,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1884
02:15:32,443 --> 02:15:35,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Because everyone's like, whew, okay, maybe I will buy the game.

1885
02:15:38,326 --> 02:15:44,569
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting though that there was kind of like, I'm imagining that feature probably existed for the purposes of like testing the game.

1886
02:15:44,929 --> 02:15:47,150
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you might want to listen up because this could be your future career.

1887
02:15:47,190 --> 02:15:47,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I am listening.

1888
02:15:48,070 --> 02:15:58,755
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be something that was there for the testers to use that they did, you know, because sometimes that's where a lot of these codes come from is like the play testing of the game, right?

1889
02:15:58,815 --> 02:15:59,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot of those.

1890
02:15:59,375 --> 02:16:00,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the Contra code.

1891
02:16:00,696 --> 02:16:02,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all that stuff came from like play testing.

1892
02:16:03,357 --> 02:16:03,917
[SPEAKER_04]: and so forth.

1893
02:16:04,457 --> 02:16:06,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes those codes kind of get out.

1894
02:16:06,938 --> 02:16:11,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, just maybe, could one actually exist in the Capcom game?

1895
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:12,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.

1896
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:18,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe there's an A, B, X, Y, L, R type of thing that maybe will save the day for Capcom too?

1897
02:16:19,342 --> 02:16:20,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Could possibly be.

1898
02:16:20,222 --> 02:16:20,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows?

1899
02:16:21,022 --> 02:16:22,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably don't hold your breath though, right?

1900
02:16:22,903 --> 02:16:25,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, or else you'd need a dev system or something.

1901
02:16:25,784 --> 02:16:26,104
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1902
02:16:27,258 --> 02:16:28,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm noticing this comment from our chat room.

1903
02:16:29,181 --> 02:16:31,606
[SPEAKER_04]: RDG Singe says, so are they backpedaling?

1904
02:16:31,646 --> 02:16:33,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you consider this backpedaling, Loki?

1905
02:16:34,094 --> 02:16:39,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, no, because I don't really think they, I mean, okay, maybe a little bit.

1906
02:16:40,136 --> 02:16:42,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because they did say, well, the whole purpose was to do that.

1907
02:16:43,017 --> 02:16:51,259
[SPEAKER_05]: What they should have said, yeah, well, you know, we originally wanted it to be that this is kind of an arcade experience and that's why you don't have this.

1908
02:16:51,759 --> 02:16:56,080
[SPEAKER_05]: But if, you know, you really do want to erase your save, then here's how you go about and do it.

1909
02:16:56,861 --> 02:16:58,261
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been the proper response.

1910
02:17:00,509 --> 02:17:09,696
[SPEAKER_04]: But instead they sent out something cryptic that looked like trying to crack a code from that horrible Nicolas Cage movie or something.

1911
02:17:09,736 --> 02:17:11,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, what the hell is this?

1912
02:17:11,337 --> 02:17:12,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's drunk at Namco right now?

1913
02:17:13,418 --> 02:17:14,259
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what, though?

1914
02:17:15,019 --> 02:17:17,181
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end, all that matters is the end response.

1915
02:17:17,761 --> 02:17:19,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And their game has a code.

1916
02:17:20,203 --> 02:17:21,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Capcom's doesn't.

1917
02:17:21,444 --> 02:17:24,326
[SPEAKER_05]: So guess which one will be most likely purchased?

1918
02:17:24,646 --> 02:17:25,126
[SPEAKER_05]: True enough.

1919
02:17:26,147 --> 02:17:30,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on the fence about this game, and now I'm back in the maybe I will buy it column.

1920
02:17:31,189 --> 02:17:34,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, one other story for you guys, and I know some of you are looking forward to this game.

1921
02:17:34,830 --> 02:17:37,231
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a game I play a lot of, but I know a lot of you play it.

1922
02:17:37,351 --> 02:17:38,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Modern Warfare 3.

1923
02:17:39,172 --> 02:17:40,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, Modern Warfare 3 is coming out.

1924
02:17:41,112 --> 02:17:44,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember we were talking earlier in the show about Activision Blizzard had a conference call.

1925
02:17:44,774 --> 02:17:47,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, something they confirmed about Modern Warfare 3.

1926
02:17:47,555 --> 02:17:50,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's going to make some of you guys very happy, some of you holdouts.

1927
02:17:50,876 --> 02:17:52,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be available on the Wii.

1928
02:17:53,157 --> 02:17:53,758
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1929
02:17:53,818 --> 02:17:58,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out that cutting edge graphics and technology on the Wii.

1930
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:02,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Modern Warfare 3 is going to be available on the Wii this holiday.

1931
02:18:04,443 --> 02:18:07,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently on November 8th, right when all the other versions of the game come out.

1932
02:18:08,145 --> 02:18:09,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's being made by Treyarch.

1933
02:18:10,106 --> 02:18:11,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Spider-Man Web of Shadows

1934
02:18:24,099 --> 02:18:25,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Modern Warfare 3 Modern Wii Faire

1935
02:18:53,177 --> 02:18:56,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that name for it, it makes it sound cute Modern Wefair

1936
02:19:03,345 --> 02:19:09,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1937
02:19:09,310 --> 02:19:11,692
[SPEAKER_04]: The Skype line is open right now.

1938
02:19:12,012 --> 02:19:17,457
[SPEAKER_04]: But while we wait for some calls, let's do some Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

1939
02:19:17,817 --> 02:19:23,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to start from this one from TigerClaw305 because it's news that we forgot to mention and I think it's kind of important.

1940
02:19:23,902 --> 02:19:24,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Metroid turned 25 this week.

1941
02:19:26,684 --> 02:19:29,065
[SPEAKER_04]: All the old NES games are turning 25, right?

1942
02:19:29,105 --> 02:19:40,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario turned 25, I think Zelda's 25 pretty soon Metroid as well, or Zelda did turn 25, that was part of what they did at E3 Metroid just turned 25 this past week Yay!

1943
02:19:40,568 --> 02:19:52,292
[SPEAKER_04]: In related news, you're old Because I'm sure many of you have played Metroid in the past And that's now a 25 year old game DarkSakura, how does that make you feel that Metroid is a 25 year old game?

1944
02:19:53,424 --> 02:19:53,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Perky.

1945
02:19:56,205 --> 02:19:57,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Perky and full of ice cream.

1946
02:19:59,306 --> 02:20:01,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to other tweets while we wait for some calls.

1947

[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the Skype line is open right now.

1948

[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or as your name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

02:20:06,508 --> 02:20:08,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, right as I say that, we get some calls.

1950
02:20:08,389 --> 02:20:09,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1951
02:20:09,289 --> 02:20:09,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1952
02:20:10,209 --> 02:20:11,369
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one and only Ranma.

1953
02:20:11,489 --> 02:20:12,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, one and only Ranma.

1954
02:20:12,490 --> 02:20:12,790
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

1955
02:20:13,690 --> 02:20:14,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too much.

1956
02:20:14,570 --> 02:20:20,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a, not a question, but something I want to discuss from a podcast a couple of weeks ago.

1957
02:20:20,772 --> 02:20:22,333
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can rewind back just a bit.

1958
02:20:22,493 --> 02:20:22,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

1959
02:20:24,434 --> 02:20:30,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wanted to talk about it last week, but it would have been too much for me to cover, so I have to spread it out.

1960
02:20:32,239 --> 02:20:38,102
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you remember, a couple of weeks ago, you posted on your profile an article about sports games.

1961
02:20:39,403 --> 02:20:39,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1962
02:20:40,644 --> 02:20:47,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I was thinking about that, and it's like how the person said that you could say Mario Kart is also a sports game.

1963
02:20:48,953 --> 02:20:49,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember this.

1964
02:20:49,693 --> 02:20:56,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't it the whole article about don't be so harsh on sports games because sometimes they're kind of leading the way for other series of games?

1965
02:20:56,459 --> 02:20:56,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this.

1966
02:20:57,159 --> 02:20:57,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1967
02:20:58,100 --> 02:20:59,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.

1968
02:20:59,701 --> 02:21:07,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was thinking, well, I guess in my opinion, you can't say that Mario Kart is a sports game.

1969
02:21:07,547 --> 02:21:10,990
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like saying WWE is actual legitimate wrestling.

1970
02:21:12,751 --> 02:21:13,732
[SPEAKER_04]: But to some it is.

1971
02:21:14,132 --> 02:21:17,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, isn't Mario Kart something you might see on the Ocho?

1972
02:21:19,494 --> 02:21:20,294
[SPEAKER_04]: ESPN 8?

1973
02:21:23,596 --> 02:21:25,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever actually looked at ESPN 3?

1974
02:21:26,156 --> 02:21:27,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of that shit isn't sports either.

1975
02:21:28,717 --> 02:21:29,758
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.

1976
02:21:30,098 --> 02:21:31,538
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like this.

1977
02:21:32,159 --> 02:21:35,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the sports games, you have to have a bit of a learning curve.

1978
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:39,761
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to study the manual so you know what you're doing, what all the buttons do.

1979
02:21:39,801 --> 02:21:40,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas with games like...

1980
02:21:42,082 --> 02:21:45,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart, any of the Mario titles, you just pick up the game and start playing.

1981
02:21:45,964 --> 02:21:49,205
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to learn any strategies or tactics or anything like that.

1982
02:21:49,285 --> 02:21:50,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a pick up and play.

1983
02:21:51,626 --> 02:21:59,209
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I mean, but I do understand that it can be considered a sports title, but on the same token, it's not because it's, it's just a fun game to pick up and play.

1984
02:21:59,409 --> 02:22:04,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot of sports games you can kind of pick up and play too, like, you know, especially the old school ones.

1985
02:22:04,351 --> 02:22:05,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what's the goal of basketball?

1986
02:22:05,891 --> 02:22:06,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw ball in net?

1987
02:22:06,952 --> 02:22:07,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I can do that.

1988
02:22:07,852 --> 02:22:08,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go.

1989
02:22:08,272 --> 02:22:09,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, of course.

1990
02:22:09,533 --> 02:22:09,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm

1991
02:22:10,453 --> 02:22:11,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at Tecmo Bowl.

1992
02:22:11,714 --> 02:22:14,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, that was a sports game, but on the same token, it wasn't.

1993
02:22:14,837 --> 02:22:19,842
[SPEAKER_02]: All you had to do was push in the command for your play, hit the button, and that was it, you know?

1994
02:22:19,962 --> 02:22:22,024
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing and awesome.

1995
02:22:22,704 --> 02:22:22,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1996
02:22:23,245 --> 02:22:23,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was.

1997
02:22:26,347 --> 02:22:29,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just called in to bitch about how Mario Kart Wii is not a sport.

1998
02:22:30,531 --> 02:22:36,757
[SPEAKER_02]: More or less, but I understand where the person's coming from, but I guess from the way I look at it, it's not really a sports title.

1999
02:22:38,234 --> 02:22:41,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it can be considered that, but I'm just saying that's my opinion.

2000
02:22:41,882 --> 02:22:43,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, it's not a sports title.

2001
02:22:43,786 --> 02:22:44,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what?

2002
02:22:45,530 --> 02:22:47,554
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a family fun game.

2003
02:22:47,594 --> 02:22:48,837
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you call it, you know?

2004
02:22:50,809 --> 02:23:15,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying whereas most of the sports games that EA puts out you have to learn the insides and outs of it to play it really well whereas there are other games that are sports games but you don't need to learn the insides and outs you just need to know what the buttons do and just start playing and that's it alright, fair enough anything else on your mind?

2005
02:23:16,468 --> 02:23:18,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you should try out for the tester too.

2006
02:23:18,269 --> 02:23:19,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying out for the tester.

2007
02:23:19,590 --> 02:23:20,551
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be Rob.

2008
02:23:20,851 --> 02:23:22,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking fabulous, bitches.

2009
02:23:22,532 --> 02:23:22,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Roberts.

2010
02:23:23,012 --> 02:23:24,453
[SPEAKER_04]: A gay guy won last season.

2011
02:23:24,593 --> 02:23:26,294
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to win two seasons in a row.

2012
02:23:26,734 --> 02:23:28,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it could happen.

2013
02:23:28,135 --> 02:23:29,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I may start a revolution.

2014
02:23:29,516 --> 02:23:32,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on now.

2015
02:23:33,078 --> 02:23:37,641
[SPEAKER_02]: You could win it and just walk up and win it two snaps up in a B-Monte formation.

2016
02:23:38,041 --> 02:23:39,342
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for a girl to win.

2017
02:23:39,482 --> 02:23:41,043
[SPEAKER_02]: But won't you vote for me?

2018
02:23:44,058 --> 02:23:44,719
[SPEAKER_04]: You made her cry.

2019
02:23:45,079 --> 02:23:45,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to go.

2020
02:23:45,621 --> 02:23:46,322
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on you, buddy.

2021
02:23:46,382 --> 02:23:47,765
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not a team player!

2022
02:23:48,446 --> 02:23:49,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, hold it.

2023
02:23:49,408 --> 02:23:49,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Back it up.

2024
02:23:49,909 --> 02:23:50,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Back it up here.

2025
02:23:51,332 --> 02:23:54,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you know, I always have the back of Jamie.

2026
02:23:55,802 --> 02:23:56,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, and Rob.

2027
02:23:56,842 --> 02:23:57,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.

2028
02:23:57,083 --> 02:24:01,204
[SPEAKER_02]: But no matter what, I will always vote for Jamie because Jamie's the number one.

2029
02:24:01,404 --> 02:24:02,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple as that.

2030
02:24:02,305 --> 02:24:05,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I always got Ook-Chan's back no matter what.

2031
02:24:05,526 --> 02:24:06,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

2032
02:24:06,127 --> 02:24:10,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've ranked the OLR hosts from most desirable to least desirable.

2033
02:24:10,769 --> 02:24:11,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the cutest.

2034
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:16,011
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm the cutest.

2035
02:24:16,031 --> 02:24:17,612
[SPEAKER_02]: She put up with me for a weekend.

2036
02:24:17,672 --> 02:24:19,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that alone deserves a trophy.

2037
02:24:19,692 --> 02:24:21,893
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've got the best rack of anyone in this room.

2038
02:24:22,474 --> 02:24:23,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no, maybe Loki's is better.

2039
02:24:24,274 --> 02:24:25,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Rama, I'm the cutest.

2040
02:24:27,336 --> 02:24:28,496
[SPEAKER_02]: You're more like the fabulous.

2041
02:24:30,517 --> 02:24:30,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

2042
02:24:31,217 --> 02:24:31,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fabulous.

2043
02:24:32,357 --> 02:24:32,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And cute.

2044
02:24:32,937 --> 02:24:33,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye.

2045
02:24:33,937 --> 02:24:34,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2046
02:24:35,938 --> 02:24:36,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take another call.

2047
02:24:36,818 --> 02:24:37,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done with Ranma.

2048
02:24:37,578 --> 02:24:38,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2049
02:24:38,778 --> 02:24:39,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2050
02:24:40,278 --> 02:24:40,898
[SPEAKER_04]: The Werenate.

2051
02:24:42,259 --> 02:24:42,679
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the name?

2052
02:24:43,479 --> 02:24:44,159
[SPEAKER_15]: The Werenate.

2053
02:24:44,299 --> 02:24:44,959
[SPEAKER_15]: The Werenate.

2054
02:24:45,159 --> 02:24:45,539
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up?

2055
02:24:46,579 --> 02:24:50,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I was calling because I wanted to comment on your Modern Warfare 3.

2056
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:53,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you're going to be pre-ordering on the Wii?

2057
02:24:54,741 --> 02:24:55,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Most likely.

2058
02:24:57,492 --> 02:24:58,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Sucker, why is that?

2059
02:24:58,773 --> 02:24:59,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that all you got?

2060
02:25:00,754 --> 02:25:03,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, because, you know, I'm a diehard Nintendo fan.

2061
02:25:03,997 --> 02:25:04,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Long live Nintendo.

2062
02:25:06,599 --> 02:25:10,461
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, I mean, like, I played Modern Warfare 1 on the Wii, and it was pretty nice.

2063
02:25:10,481 --> 02:25:11,442
[SPEAKER_15]: It had online play.

2064
02:25:11,582 --> 02:25:13,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Why are you saying it won't have online play?

2065
02:25:13,363 --> 02:25:15,585
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta do the waggle.

2066
02:25:17,006 --> 02:25:21,969
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll have online play, but it's not gonna be as robust as, you know, with the voice chat and all that.

2067
02:25:22,009 --> 02:25:24,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say something like Xbox Live or PlayStation Network.

2068
02:25:24,691 --> 02:25:25,172
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll just be...

2069
02:25:25,802 --> 02:25:31,246
[SPEAKER_04]: which might actually, to be fair, might be for the best because you don't want to play those games on Xbox Live because people are just rude.

2070
02:25:32,287 --> 02:25:38,713
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if you shoot someone or blow their head off in real life, do you want to have voice chat with them or do you just want to get the job done?

2071
02:25:40,474 --> 02:25:41,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Touche.

2072
02:25:41,675 --> 02:25:42,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

2073
02:25:42,376 --> 02:25:43,476
[SPEAKER_04]: The caller has a point.

2074
02:25:44,057 --> 02:25:44,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I stand corrected.

2075
02:25:45,058 --> 02:25:46,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do want to have voice chat with them.

2076
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:48,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

2077
02:25:49,081 --> 02:25:51,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the fact very much that you just blew off my head.

2078
02:25:51,783 --> 02:25:53,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you should prompt apologize for that, actually.

2079
02:25:54,764 --> 02:26:04,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you know, so I'm a Wii user, but I can't wait for the Wii U, you know, I think you all should be glorifying the Wii U, because it's going to be a pretty epic

2080
02:26:05,540 --> 02:26:07,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Not until we see the games.

2081
02:26:08,121 --> 02:26:09,661
[SPEAKER_04]: What we saw at E3 wasn't enough.

2082
02:26:09,921 --> 02:26:13,702
[SPEAKER_04]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it, and I am not convinced yet.

2083
02:26:14,282 --> 02:26:22,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yes, they talked about some of these third-party games, but they talked about games that are already coming out this holiday that might not even really end up in their same form.

2084
02:26:22,523 --> 02:26:27,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they talked about the Assassin's Creed game is not the same game that's coming out this holiday for the other systems.

2085
02:26:27,644 --> 02:26:28,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a separate game.

2086
02:26:29,044 --> 02:26:32,585
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm not sold one way or the other on Wii U. I mean...

2087
02:26:33,405 --> 02:26:33,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Outro Outro Outro

2088
02:26:39,042 --> 02:26:40,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you not see the tech demos?

2089
02:26:40,483 --> 02:26:41,164
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, come on.

2090
02:26:41,184 --> 02:26:43,305
[SPEAKER_15]: It had like tech in on it.

2091
02:26:43,325 --> 02:26:44,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on.

2092
02:26:44,146 --> 02:26:47,729
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be changing to more hardcore.

2093
02:26:48,449 --> 02:26:50,611
[SPEAKER_04]: You suddenly sound like you're underwater, but that's all right.

2094
02:26:50,831 --> 02:26:51,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Dalek voice.

2095
02:26:51,992 --> 02:26:53,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he's got the Dalek voice going on.

2096
02:26:54,354 --> 02:26:58,157
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

2097
02:26:58,437 --> 02:27:02,801
[SPEAKER_04]: The demos, it's interesting, but let me ask you this.

2098
02:27:03,781 --> 02:27:07,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't the Vita and the PlayStation 3 essentially do the same thing?

2099
02:27:10,652 --> 02:27:17,398
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm, oops, almost muted it, but the Vita is not even better than the 3DS.

2100
02:27:19,139 --> 02:27:23,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's got, well, I don't know about that.

2101
02:27:23,243 --> 02:27:24,224
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of relative.

2102
02:27:24,244 --> 02:27:25,765
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on what games it gets.

2103
02:27:26,286 --> 02:27:34,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about the processors, put them side by side, but I imagine that, sorry, Loki's showing off his cheating in his game.

2104
02:27:34,533 --> 02:27:37,776
[SPEAKER_04]: He's cheating, getting five million tower bucks from cheating.

2105
02:27:38,939 --> 02:27:40,601
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot cheaper than buying them.

2106
02:27:41,342 --> 02:27:41,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry.

2107
02:27:50,915 --> 02:27:58,679
[SPEAKER_15]: As a developer, I hope that I can see some better games besides that roller skating game and roller goo on there.

2108
02:27:58,959 --> 02:28:02,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one with the guys in the Speedos trying to get through the walls.

2109
02:28:02,320 --> 02:28:03,781
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a real fun game, actually.

2110
02:28:06,062 --> 02:28:10,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you can say something critical about Nintendo, because I was getting a little worried that you were a little bit too much fanboy.

2111
02:28:10,704 --> 02:28:11,565
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, I agree.

2112
02:28:12,045 --> 02:28:15,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Their online as a whole really needs to improve, so I hope they do it.

2113
02:28:15,428 --> 02:28:19,170
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say the 3DS has done some things right online, so we'll see.

2114
02:28:19,691 --> 02:28:22,192
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have one yet, but you can send me one if you want.

2115
02:28:23,954 --> 02:28:24,434
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

2116
02:28:24,574 --> 02:28:26,616
[SPEAKER_04]: We might have a contest around the holidays.

2117
02:28:26,936 --> 02:28:28,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I've got to let you go so we can get more calls, but thanks for the input.

2118
02:28:30,438 --> 02:28:30,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2119
02:28:30,879 --> 02:28:30,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2120
02:28:33,260 --> 02:28:34,160
[SPEAKER_04]: is taking another call here.

2121
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:35,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2122
02:28:35,661 --> 02:28:36,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2123
02:28:36,961 --> 02:28:38,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Yo, guys, it's Xenocore from the OKC.

2124
02:28:38,962 --> 02:28:39,382
[SPEAKER_14]: How you doing?

2125
02:28:39,402 --> 02:28:41,482
[SPEAKER_04]: What is up, Xenocore from OKC?

2126
02:28:41,743 --> 02:28:42,463
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind tonight?

2127
02:28:43,303 --> 02:28:43,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Not much.

2128
02:28:43,683 --> 02:28:46,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Just been playing a bit of Earth Defense Force 2011.

2129
02:28:47,404 --> 02:28:49,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a game that's near and dear to Loki's heart.

2130
02:28:49,585 --> 02:28:50,145
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

2131
02:28:51,185 --> 02:28:54,406
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not bad, but I'm not even sure if the game has an ending yet.

2132
02:28:54,446 --> 02:28:59,868
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been playing it online so I can have some backup, and every time it gets to the last miss and it just resets.

2133
02:29:01,474 --> 02:29:02,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, is this a problem?

2134
02:29:03,336 --> 02:29:08,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the very last mission, I mean, it depends on what difficulty you're playing on.

2135
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:12,064
[SPEAKER_05]: The ending's not very long.

2136
02:29:12,784 --> 02:29:13,225
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really end.

2137
02:29:13,245 --> 02:29:15,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I never figured the ending would be that long.

2138
02:29:15,146 --> 02:29:17,068
[SPEAKER_14]: This whole game, it's the gameplay itself.

2139
02:29:17,208 --> 02:29:21,552
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do at least want to know what the hell happened because it's just like all your characters vanish.

2140
02:29:22,013 --> 02:29:27,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you just have to play it on a harder difficulty because each time you beat the game on a harder difficulty, the ending's longer and longer.

2141
02:29:29,330 --> 02:29:49,236
[SPEAKER_14]: it would have been nice if they gave you some sort of a hint like play this on the harder difficulty to find out what happens or something like that well I think they also have DLC coming so you know it's hard to say what exactly they'll be having and I've been playing the hell out of 4k kill team as well you're cutting in and out a little bit there but that's alright you've been playing the hell out of what?

2142
02:29:50,676 --> 02:29:55,818
[SPEAKER_04]: hammer 40,000 kill team oh didn't you mention this game on an earlier episode of the show I think you did

2143
02:29:56,328 --> 02:29:57,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I finally grabbed a hold of it.

2144
02:29:58,310 --> 02:29:59,631
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not bad for 10 bucks.

2145
02:29:59,691 --> 02:30:00,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely worth the money.

2146
02:30:02,252 --> 02:30:03,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to look into that.

2147
02:30:03,854 --> 02:30:04,634
[SPEAKER_04]: What else have you been playing?

2148
02:30:04,674 --> 02:30:05,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

2149
02:30:05,915 --> 02:30:07,316
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's about it.

2150
02:30:07,336 --> 02:30:08,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Trying to save some money.

2151
02:30:09,618 --> 02:30:12,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Any new stories you want to talk about tonight that we talked about on the show?

2152
02:30:12,860 --> 02:30:18,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I did want to comment on the whole thing about Diablo 3 going online only.

2153
02:30:19,756 --> 02:30:21,717
[SPEAKER_14]: and what company aspects of that are.

2154
02:30:22,417 --> 02:30:22,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

2155
02:30:22,797 --> 02:30:24,037
[SPEAKER_04]: You're still cutting in and out a little bit.

2156
02:30:24,057 --> 02:30:26,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what's going on with the connection, but I'll let you get your thought out there.

2157
02:30:26,918 --> 02:30:27,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand you enough.

2158
02:30:29,299 --> 02:30:31,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Blizzard knows that everything is possible with code.

2159
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:33,100
[SPEAKER_14]: All they need is time.

2160
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:40,082
[SPEAKER_14]: They do have to do something for copy protection, but honestly...

2161
02:30:40,754 --> 02:30:47,397
[SPEAKER_14]: If they think this is going to stop anything, then they really need to get their coding team and reevaluate who's working for them.

2162
02:30:47,417 --> 02:30:52,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Because whoever told them that this is going to defeat online hacking is ridiculous.

2163
02:30:52,580 --> 02:30:54,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it happens at World of Warcraft right now.

2164
02:30:55,261 --> 02:30:55,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

2165
02:30:56,521 --> 02:30:56,962
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

2166
02:30:57,002 --> 02:30:59,943
[SPEAKER_04]: But they ban players from World of Warcraft left and right too, right?

2167
02:31:00,390 --> 02:31:02,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but that won't keep them from getting back in the game.

2168
02:31:02,732 --> 02:31:03,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

2169
02:31:03,652 --> 02:31:04,653
[SPEAKER_04]: What about StarCraft 2?

2170
02:31:04,753 --> 02:31:05,954
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the issues that that game's having?

2171
02:31:05,994 --> 02:31:06,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they having issues too?

2172
02:31:07,175 --> 02:31:09,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they have their own variety of issues.

2173
02:31:09,756 --> 02:31:14,039
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not so much because there's no real persistence in the game other than you think.

2174
02:31:14,499 --> 02:31:19,343
[SPEAKER_14]: But you'll see people do lag hacks and stuff to interfere with the other player's game.

2175
02:31:19,803 --> 02:31:20,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Remove the fog of wars.

2176
02:31:20,924 --> 02:31:23,285
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see what your player's doing without having you nearby.

2177
02:31:23,666 --> 02:31:25,827
[SPEAKER_14]: More gameplay hacks more than anything else.

2178
02:31:26,367 --> 02:31:28,749
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's even more critical to the play of the game.

2179
02:31:28,849 --> 02:31:30,290
[SPEAKER_14]: So it does more damage.

2180
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:40,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very curious to see just, you know, how legally this all plays out, especially when the first exploit does come down the hill and then suddenly it's impacting the real money trading house.

2181
02:31:41,126 --> 02:31:42,546
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got to be thinking of something.

2182
02:31:42,627 --> 02:31:45,148
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be something in place they're doing.

2183
02:31:45,388 --> 02:31:54,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, they're swearing up and down that they've looked at it from a legal perspective, but just because it's totally legal right now, too, doesn't mean it will always be legal.

2184
02:31:54,854 --> 02:31:56,334
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the other thing I kind of worry about with them.

2185
02:31:56,355 --> 02:32:00,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially when they have... The main thing between Second Life and this...

2186
02:32:00,937 --> 02:32:03,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Second line, people are making the assets themselves.

2187
02:32:03,962 --> 02:32:05,845
[SPEAKER_14]: The game isn't supplying them with assets.

2188
02:32:06,426 --> 02:32:09,411
[SPEAKER_14]: If you supply them with the assets, technically Blizzard still owns them.

2189
02:32:10,052 --> 02:32:12,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Second line, you have rights to whatever you create.

2190
02:32:14,124 --> 02:32:14,825
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.

2191
02:32:14,885 --> 02:32:21,630
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be very, very strange what happens, but we'll see what happens once the politicians pull their heads out their asses.

2192
02:32:21,990 --> 02:32:23,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard is going to be printing money with this.

2193
02:32:23,912 --> 02:32:24,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be very interesting.

2194
02:32:24,813 --> 02:32:26,054
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Xenocore, I've got to let you go.

2195
02:32:26,174 --> 02:32:28,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Skype's acting up, so take care, buddy, okay?

2196
02:32:28,856 --> 02:32:29,356
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, later, man.

2197
02:32:29,377 --> 02:32:29,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

2198
02:32:30,878 --> 02:32:31,178
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2199
02:32:31,939 --> 02:32:32,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, listeners.

2200
02:32:32,719 --> 02:32:35,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to hear his thoughts on that, and I know he's cutting in and out.

2201
02:32:35,562 --> 02:32:38,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably a little annoying, but I was able to understand most of it.

2202
02:32:38,804 --> 02:32:43,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go back to Twitter because I got to get through some more of these Twitter topics here and then I'll see if any more calls are coming in at that point.

2203
02:32:45,627 --> 02:32:50,710
[SPEAKER_04]: More Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR as I load them up here.

2204
02:32:51,910 --> 02:32:52,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2205
02:32:52,591 --> 02:32:54,151
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually don't have a whole lot tonight.

2206
02:32:54,251 --> 02:32:55,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go to...

2207
02:32:57,899 --> 02:33:03,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Redertainment says, I meant to email you, but can you warn people that deep vein thrombosis is serious?

2208
02:33:04,442 --> 02:33:06,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Get up and walk around about every two hours.

2209
02:33:07,343 --> 02:33:12,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when they say take a break during a long gaming session, they're not kidding.

2210
02:33:12,286 --> 02:33:13,446
[SPEAKER_04]: You really should get up and take a break.

2211
02:33:13,746 --> 02:33:19,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Even when we raid in WoW, we take a quote-unquote bio break every couple hours for a few minutes.

2212
02:33:19,829 --> 02:33:24,531
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a chance for folks to get up, get water, stay hydrated, get a snack, go to the restroom.

2213
02:33:24,751 --> 02:33:25,292
[SPEAKER_04]: and so forth.

2214
02:33:25,352 --> 02:33:26,193
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just good practice.

2215
02:33:26,213 --> 02:33:28,756
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy sat down, I think, for 12 hours.

2216
02:33:28,876 --> 02:33:32,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we talking about the guy overseas that died or whatever?

2217
02:33:32,861 --> 02:33:33,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2218
02:33:34,923 --> 02:33:36,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what was that all about?

2219
02:33:36,605 --> 02:33:38,167
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a 12-hour gaming session.

2220
02:33:39,248 --> 02:33:39,809
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll kill you.

2221
02:33:44,011 --> 02:33:47,093
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on to more tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

2222
02:33:47,113 --> 02:33:48,854
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple from Tigerclaw back to back here.

2223
02:33:50,455 --> 02:33:57,259
[SPEAKER_04]: North Korea's Kim Jong-il is running MMO gold farming racket is the tweet that's sent here.

2224
02:33:57,359 --> 02:34:00,541
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a news story from Game Informer delivered to us from Tigerclaw.

2225
02:34:01,201 --> 02:34:09,647
[SPEAKER_04]: The New York Times is reporting that North Korea is using a team of hackers to infiltrate popular South Korean MMORPGs and farm in-game points.

2226
02:34:10,307 --> 02:34:23,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Specially trained North Korean hackers working in concert with South Korean and Chinese operatives have been infiltrating popular MMOs like Lineage, accumulating in-game points, selling them on the internet black market.

2227
02:34:24,264 --> 02:34:31,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, the Times say that they've earned over $6 million for their efforts, over half of which has been delivered to North Korean agents in the capital of Pyongyang.

2228
02:34:33,068 --> 02:34:35,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so please don't support this stuff.

2229
02:34:35,929 --> 02:34:41,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's just, I mean, look, people are going to do whatever they have to do to make money, that's fine.

2230
02:34:41,892 --> 02:34:49,155
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you support it, like you're supporting devious tactics, like hacking, like credit card information getting stolen and so forth.

2231
02:34:49,195 --> 02:34:51,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all going to ruin your gameplay experience.

2232
02:34:51,696 --> 02:34:51,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

2233
02:34:51,896 --> 02:34:52,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

2234
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:15,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragnarok Violet Ragnarok Violet

2235
02:35:37,009 --> 02:36:02,351
[SPEAKER_04]: it does not say oh no it looks like it is in US you can read the description on the app store and I click on it and it takes me to the US app store for Ragnarok Violet I didn't even get that sentence out of my mouth and DarkSakura I heard the click on the iPhone shut up it's free but there oh there's in-game items like you can get pet eggs and all this crap it's like a free thing

2236
02:36:04,011 --> 02:36:05,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to go, Tigerclaw.

2237
02:36:05,573 --> 02:36:07,955
[SPEAKER_04]: We just lost DarkSakura to Ragnarok all over again.

2238
02:36:08,296 --> 02:36:09,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Tigerclaw.

2239
02:36:10,298 --> 02:36:17,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but the one problem is that if it works with my IRO account and I'm not playing IRO anymore, then I might be kind of SOL.

2240
02:36:17,679 --> 02:36:23,984
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya in our chat reminds us about a birthday that happened, saying yesterday there was a birthday that harkens back to our music game roots.

2241
02:36:24,524 --> 02:36:30,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Taku Sakiakyabra, I probably mispronounced that name really horribly, turned another year older.

2242
02:36:30,149 --> 02:36:36,033
[SPEAKER_04]: But you guys all know Taku, or T-A-Q, not taco, but Taku, turned a year older.

2243
02:36:36,433 --> 02:36:37,374
[SPEAKER_04]: How old does that make him?

2244
02:36:38,235 --> 02:36:38,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2245
02:36:38,675 --> 02:36:39,135
[SPEAKER_12]: A year older.

2246
02:36:39,576 --> 02:36:40,156
[SPEAKER_04]: A year older.

2247
02:36:40,797 --> 02:36:41,938
[SPEAKER_04]: But here you go, guys.

2248
02:36:42,078 --> 02:36:43,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy some Birthdayholic.

2249
02:36:47,657 --> 02:36:47,977
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2250
02:36:47,997 --> 02:36:49,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Birthdayholic for Taku.

2251
02:36:49,698 --> 02:36:49,978
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2252
02:36:50,538 --> 02:36:51,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Black Lab.

2253
02:36:52,098 --> 02:36:52,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember him?

2254
02:36:52,998 --> 02:36:57,760
[SPEAKER_04]: He used to come to the show years and years ago, like in the first hundred episodes or so.

2255
02:36:58,180 --> 02:37:01,801
[SPEAKER_04]: He's listening tonight and sends us tweets and has some Twitter questions.

2256
02:37:02,161 --> 02:37:04,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, will there be a drunk show soon?

2257
02:37:05,321 --> 02:37:06,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

2258
02:37:06,222 --> 02:37:07,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave up drinking.

2259
02:37:08,602 --> 02:37:09,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

2260
02:37:09,222 --> 02:37:09,822
[SPEAKER_04]: We got old.

2261
02:37:10,863 --> 02:37:14,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Question two, does Jamie still have that copy of Owen Don that I gave her?

2262
02:37:15,124 --> 02:37:15,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy face.

2263
02:37:16,127 --> 02:37:18,910
[SPEAKER_13]: How to get a Nintendo fangirl to try playing non-Zelda games

2264
02:37:41,684 --> 02:37:46,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if she's not playing non-Zelda games, then she's not much of a fangirl, is she?

2265
02:37:47,329 --> 02:37:48,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Of Nintendo.

2266
02:37:48,710 --> 02:37:49,370
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

2267
02:37:49,771 --> 02:37:50,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2268
02:37:50,171 --> 02:37:50,751
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the girl.

2269
02:37:51,732 --> 02:37:54,214
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you convince other girls to play games that aren't Zelda?

2270
02:37:55,795 --> 02:37:57,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Pass over your DS and say, here, give this a go.

2271
02:37:58,838 --> 02:38:00,699
[SPEAKER_04]: What if they say, no, I'm too busy.

2272
02:38:02,461 --> 02:38:03,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Busy doing what?

2273
02:38:03,562 --> 02:38:04,102
[SPEAKER_04]: My hair.

2274
02:38:05,383 --> 02:38:06,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well, that's important.

2275
02:38:06,224 --> 02:38:07,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Baking a pie.

2276
02:38:08,366 --> 02:38:09,306
[SPEAKER_12]: As long as they share the pie.

2277
02:38:09,326 --> 02:38:11,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing my application for the tester.

2278
02:38:11,721 --> 02:38:16,310
[SPEAKER_12]: I already did that there's always time for games

2279
02:38:19,362 --> 02:38:41,914

2284
02:39:10,940 --> 02:39:14,442
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, I'm going to go over to Loki and see if there's any last-minute stories tonight.

2285
02:39:14,482 --> 02:39:15,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there is.

2286
02:39:15,103 --> 02:39:15,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we got it all.

2287
02:39:15,823 --> 02:39:17,684
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was really slow.

2288
02:39:18,345 --> 02:39:21,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was kind of a slow news week, hence why it's kind of a shorter show tonight.

2289
02:39:21,367 --> 02:39:25,109
[SPEAKER_04]: But they can't always be action-packed weeks, especially as we get closer and closer.

2290
02:39:25,209 --> 02:39:26,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we get after Labor Day...

2291
02:39:26,730 --> 02:39:28,951
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to be go, go, go, go, go until the end of the year.

2292
02:39:29,071 --> 02:39:30,332
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

2293
02:39:30,952 --> 02:39:31,212
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2294
02:39:31,232 --> 02:39:34,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that means we're coming to the close of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2295
02:39:34,834 --> 02:39:36,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank all you guys for listening this week.

2299
02:39:44,840 --> 02:39:46,080
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't even ask for money.

2300
02:39:46,500 --> 02:39:50,222

2301

2302
02:39:51,483 --> 02:39:52,824

2305
02:39:58,827 --> 02:40:00,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes a long way to help promote the show.

2306
02:40:00,708 --> 02:40:07,592
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys again for continuing to support the show week after week, showing up on Sunday nights, those of you that can, and so on.

2307
02:40:07,893 --> 02:40:09,574
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it all worthwhile to be here again.

2308
02:40:09,874 --> 02:40:17,118
[SPEAKER_04]: And for Dark Sakura to make an audition tape that you all can vote on soon for this show that I can't believe she's actually going to go on.

2309
02:40:17,583 --> 02:40:21,284
[SPEAKER_12]: We should stack all of my Sony stuff behind me and go, look at this shit.

2310
02:40:22,304 --> 02:40:22,904
[SPEAKER_12]: You owe me.

2311
02:40:24,725 --> 02:40:25,005
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2312
02:40:25,765 --> 02:40:28,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

2313
02:40:28,765 --> 02:40:29,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, we'll start with you.

2314
02:40:29,826 --> 02:40:36,547
[SPEAKER_04]: The cheating cheater of Tiny Tower, the hacker who has five million Tower bucks that he did not purchase.

2315
02:40:37,987 --> 02:40:40,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's basically infinite because it's not going down.

2316
02:40:41,668 --> 02:40:42,768
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your final thought tonight?

2317
02:40:43,128 --> 02:40:45,189
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I have 13 floors already.

2318
02:40:47,886 --> 02:40:49,969
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?

2319
02:40:50,429 --> 02:40:50,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Hire me.

2320
02:40:52,651 --> 02:40:56,135
[SPEAKER_04]: And my final thought tonight is tacos.

2321
02:40:57,076 --> 02:40:59,358
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
